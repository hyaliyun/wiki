Story  The story of Red Stone begins in the fantasy world of Prandel as players go on an adventurous quest to search for a mystical red stone that fell from heaven. At the end of the story, the player may choose to give the red stone in exchange for rewards to one of Prandels three factions, the Red Devil, the Underworld or Heaven, who seek to use the power of the Red Stone for their own gain.  Synopsis  When the information about Red stone was first released, The game was supposed to be a single-player RPG that the player should choose one of several characters and be proceeded with the story. And then there was no news for a while, and then all of sudden, it was released as Online MMORPG game which had almost different concept from what it was at the first place. However, back in the time when it was being developed as a single-player game, the characteristics of the game such as the transformation system were already established. The game that came out with its unique catchphrase called Transformation RPG. In fact, players were highly excited when its transformation system was released, but what came out of it was the slow-paced 2D game such as Lineage (video game). In result, many people left. However, the transformation system itself was novel and there were quite a lot strategies for it.  Classes  * Squire * Warrior * Magic Archer * Magic Lancer * Magician * Werewolf * Priest * Fallen Angel * Thief * Monk * Princess * Little Witch * Necromancer * Demon * Spiritualist * Champion * Opticalist * Beastman * Maid * Demon Sorceress * Musketeer * Alchemist  Gameplay  Red stone features the combat between the player and the monster using various skills along with the transformation system. It has two classes for each character at the same time. Converting a class is called in-game term \\"transformation\\" or \\"weapon conversion\\". Classes that transform include Magician / Werewolf, Priest / Fallen Angel, Necromancer / Devil, Princess / Little witch, Maid / Demon sorceress, and Musketeer / Alchemist . The rest are weapon conversion classes. The reason for distinguishing between transformation and weapon conversion is that the class conversion method is different. It is necessary for both transformation and weapon conversion to learn one or more of the skill of the job to be replaced, but in the case of transformation, the cost of converting the class requires 15 CP. Also, if the CP becomes negative during transformation, the transformation is cancelled.  Nintendo DS adaptation  is a singleplayer only adaptation for the Nintendo DS released only in Japan. It features exclusive dungeons not available in the original game.

In addition to the species presently placed in this genus, it has included a whole range of other species now commonly placed in other genera, but some of these should perhaps be returned to Cervus. Additionally, the species-level taxonomy is in a state of flux. Taxonomy Genus Until the 1970s, Cervus also included the members of the genera Axis, Dama, Elaphurus and Hyelaphus, and until the late 1980s, it included members of Przewalskium, Rucervus and Rusa. With the exception of the chital (Axis axis), barasinga (Rucervus duvaucelii), Schomburgk's deer (R. schomburgki), and members of the genus Dama, genetic evidence suggests all should be returned to Cervus. Species In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World from 2005, only the red deer (C. elaphus) and sika deer (C. nippon) were recognized as species in the genus Cervus. Genetic and morphological evidence suggest more species should be recognized. For example, the subspecies C. e. canadensis (elk/wapiti) is considered by some to be a separate species.Ludt, C.J.L; Schroeder, Rottmann and Kuehn (2004). Mitochondrial DNA phylogeography of red deer (Cervus elaphus). Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 31: 1064–1083. Red deer species group Within the red deer species group, some sources have recommended the elk or wapiti (C. canadensis) and Central Asian red deer should be treated as species.Randi, Mucci, Claro-Hergueta, Bonnet and Douzery (2001). A mitochondrial DNA control region phylogeny of the Cervinae: speciation in Cervus and implications for conservation. Anim. Conserv. 4: 1–11. If the Central Asian red deer (from the Caspian Sea to western China) is recognized as a species, it includes the Yarkand deer and Bactrian deer (the two may be synonymous), but it could possibly also include the Kashmir stag, which has not been sampled in recent studies. If it is included in the Central Asian red deer, the scientific name of that species is C. hanglu. If it is not included, the scientific name of that species is C. yarkandensis, and the Kashmir stag (C. hanglu) may represent a separate monotypic species. Others members of the red deer group, which may represent separate species, are C. corsicanus, C. wallichi and C. xanthopygus. If so, C. corsicanus includes the subspecies C. c. barbarus (perhaps a synonym of corsicanus), and is restricted to Maghreb in North Africa, Corsica and Sardinia. C. wallichi would probably include the subspecies C. w. kansuensis and C. w. macneilli (both are perhaps synonyms of C. w. wallichi), and would be found from Tibet to central China.Smith and Xie, editors (2008). Mammals of China. C. xanthopygus would probably include the subspecies C. x. alashanicus (perhaps a synonym of C. x. xanthopygus), and would be found from the Russian Far East to northeastern China. This would restrict the \\"true\\" red deer (C. elaphus) to Europe, Anatolia, the Caucasus and northwestern Iran, and the elk/wapiti (C. canadensis) to North America and the Asian regions of the Tian Shan, Altai, and Great Khingan. Alternatively, the barbarus group species are subspecies of the \\"true\\" red deer, while the C. wallichii and C. xanthopygus groups are subspecies of the elk/wapiti. Sika deer species group The sika deer should be split into four species based on genetics, morphology and voice, although this may be premature based on the presently available evidence. If split, the potential species are C. yesoensis from northern and central Japan (Hokkaido and northern and central Honshu), C. nippon of southern Japan (southern Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, Okinawa, Tsushima and other small islands), C. hortulorum of mainland Asia (the Russian Far East, Korea, central and eastern China and northern Vietnam), and C. taiouanus of Taiwan.  Mating system  Members of the genus Cervus have polygynous mating systems within harems. These harems consist of several males, numerous females and their young offspring 1–3 years in age Members of this genus have a yearly breeding season where they display sensory exploitation, intrasexual competition, and weaponry. Females will fight for optimal mating opportunities and sexually selection for males with larger antler size and/or greater roar quality. The degree of polygyny and female aggregation is dependent on the level of food distribution. Females aggregating in areas with more food leading to larger harems Female distribution influences the level of polygyny.  Female-female competition  Female-female competition has been observed within harems in the red deer species (Cervus elaphus) prior to and during the mating season. Aggression is displayed through nose threats, kicking, and displacements. Elevated aggression has only been observed during the breeding season. Competition can be for access to mates or reproductive resources such as food, or nesting areas. Female-female aggression in ungulates is often overlooked because it is not as extravagant as male antler combat. Female conflicts occur so the winner has first access to the harem male at the start of the mating season before he is exhausted or low on sperm storage.  Secondary sexual traits  While an emphasis in observations of sexual selection is placed on combat using antlers, males with higher roaring rates are also being selected for. During the breeding season males will make calls to attract mates and compete with other males. Like antler size, mating call quality is an indicator of mate potential. Red deer can distinguish the calls of the males in their harem, others and their offspring.  Indirect benefits  Females select for males with larger antlers which indirectly benefits them. Large antler size in males is a sign of health and strength. The visual display is a reliable indicator of mate quality, providing indirect benefits. The females are not directly affected by these characteristics, but they will produce more viable and fit offspring. Males with large antlers mate and sire more offspring than smaller, younger males. Large antler size is correlated with overall health, fitness and an increase in sperm production and quality.

History :See footnoteOur History. NSSA website. Retrieved 2011-08-21. The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association (NSSA) was formed in 1959 by a local restaurant owner, Pete DiMizio, to honor regional sportscasters and sportswriters whom he had met at the Greensboro Open Golf Tournament in Greensboro, North Carolina. When DiMizio died, Dr. Ed McKenzie took over the leadership role and guided it through the expansion to a national association. Its first Annual Awards Program was held in Salisbury, North Carolina, on April 12, 1960. Lindsey Nelson was selected the 1959 National Sportscaster of the Year and Red Smith was voted the 1959 Sportswriter of the Year. In 1962 Grantland Rice was selected as the first Hall of Fame inductee. As Red Smith inducted Rice into the Hall of Fame, he said, \\"Who knows what will become of this Hall of Fame? It might never be heard from again. No matter, it cannot be improved, for it is perfect tonight with only Granny enshrined.\\" In April 1990, the NSSA celebrated its 31st Annual Awards Program, with Chris Berman of ESPN being selected as Sportscaster of the Year and Peter Gammons receiving the honor as Sportswriter of the Year. The Hall of Fame inductees were Dave Anderson, Pulitzer Prize winner from The New York Times, and Jack Buck, the long-time radio voice of the St. Louis Cardinals and a radio and television sportscaster for CBS. Though located in Salisbury, \\"the NSSA office itself has bounced around town like a ping-pong ball.\\" The Hall of Fame opened officially on May 1, 2000 in the two-story, 10,000-square-foot former North Carolina Federal Savings and Loan building at 322 East Innes Street in Salisbury. When Claude Hampton became NSSA director, he was told the Hall of Fame was nothing more than a desk drawer with folders in the Chamber of Commerce building. He wanted an actual building and considered Catawba College as a location, but when he saw the branch of the failed bank in 1990, he made an offer which was accepted. The goal was to open the museum by 1992. A 23-foot sculpture of two eagles was moved from the bank to Charlotte Motor Speedway, but people wanted the eagles back, so they were returned and local people donated their services to put the eagles back and get the building ready. An opening reception and dedication took place in 1991. But due to lack of funding, it took ten years for the building to actually open. Until then, hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of memorabilia were stored in boxes. With the Hall of Fame open, visitors could hear Babe Ruth's called shot, Hank Aaron's 715th home run, the Ice Bowl, the 1992 Duke-Kentucky game, and young Tiger Woods on The Mike Douglas Show. On November 1, 2005, Community Bank of Rowan (later part of Yadkin Financial) purchased the Innes Street location, opening its headquarters there in 2006. This required the NSSA to move to a temporary location on North Main Street in Salisbury, but visitors would not be allowed. Veteran sports journalist Dave Goren, best known as sports director at WXII-TV in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, became NSSA executive director September 1, 2009. On December 1 of that year, the NSSA held a reception at its new office in 1,900 square feet at 325 Lee Street in Salisbury. The warehouse only included a few items such as shoes autographed by Ralph Sampson and a football signed by Berman; the rest remained in storage. The NSSA has since moved to Summit Avenue in Salisbury, on the campus of Catawba College. At the 54th annual program in June 2013, Dan Patrick of ESPN Radio received the award as Sportscaster of the Year with Peter King of Sports Illustrated honored as Sportswriter of the Year. The Hall of Fame inductees were Mitch Albom and Dick Vitale. In June 2014, hockey broadcaster Mike \\"Doc\\" Emrick was voted Sportscaster of the Year, with King repeating as Sportswriter of the Year. Inducted in the Hall of Fame were sportscaster Marv Albert and sportswriter Rick Reilly. Emrick and writer Tom Verducci were the national award winners honored on June 8, 2015. Four new NSSA Hall of Fame members were inducted: baseball writer Hal McCoy, basketball commentator Bill Raftery, sportswriter and sportscaster Lesley Visser and, posthumously, author, journalist and television personality Dick Schaap. In April 2017, after 57 years in Salisbury, the National Sports Media Association moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Organization The NSSA is the only national organization which brings together the two crafts of sportscasting and sportswriting. There are approximately 1,100 dues-paying members. The Sportscasters and Sportswriters Foundation Board is made up of individuals in Salisbury, North Carolina, as well as the current national board president, who feel that sports in the United States are important. The Sportscasters and Sportswriters themselves have a Board of Directors.

He served as the Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner from 2004 to 2012 and was the running mate of David L. Williams in the 2011 gubernatorial election. After leaving office, Farmer was investigated for violating state campaign finance laws and misappropriating state resources and was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison along with a concurrent 12 months in state prison. A point guard, Farmer led Clay County High School to the 1987 Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA) State Basketball Championship and, in 1988, was named Kentucky Mr. Basketball and Kentucky Associated Press Male High School Athlete of the Year after setting a championship game record with 51 points in a losing effort. Although he was popular state-wide and publicly stated his desire to play collegiate basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats, Coach Eddie Sutton was reluctant to offer Farmer a scholarship. After Farmer announced that he would visit other colleges and issued a deadline past which he would no longer consider Kentucky without a scholarship offer, Sutton relented and Farmer joined the University of Kentucky. Kentucky struggled during Farmer's first year, finishing with a 13–19 record, and by mid-season, fans were accusing Sutton of unfairly favoring his son, Sean, over Farmer at the point guard position. Sutton resigned in the offseason due to a pay-for- play scandal for which the NCAA banned Kentucky from postseason play for two years. Sutton's replacement, Rick Pitino, instituted a rigorous conditioning program and fast-paced style of play that improved Farmer's performance. After spending his junior season as a backup to Sean Woods, Farmer transitioned to shooting guard and became a starter in the middle of his senior year. Again eligible for postseason competition, the Wildcats won the Southeastern Conference tournament and reached the Regional Finals of the 1992 NCAA Tournament, losing in overtime on a last-second shot by Duke's Christian Laettner in a game regarded by many as the greatest college basketball game ever played. The team's seniors – Farmer, Woods, John Pelphrey, and Deron Feldhaus – were dubbed \\"The Unforgettables\\", and their jerseys were hung from the rafters of Rupp Arena following the 1991–92 season. Farmer parlayed his status as a basketball icon into two terms as Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner from 2004 to 2012, winning both elections by large margins. In 2011, Kentucky Senate President David L. Williams tapped Farmer – considered a rising star in the state Republican Party – as his running mate in the gubernatorial election. They were defeated by Democratic Governor Steve Beshear and his running mate Jerry Abramson. During the campaign, media reports alleged that Farmer had misused state funds and property as agriculture commissioner and Farmer's successor collaborated with the state auditor to investigate the allegations. As a result, the Executive Branch Ethics Commission charged Farmer with 42 ethics violations – the most against an individual in state history. Attorney General Jack Conway also charged Farmer with violating state campaign finance laws, and a federal grand jury followed with five indictments for abuses of power. Farmer initially contested the charges, but later agreed to a plea bargain. On January 14, 2014, Farmer was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison and ordered to pay $120,500 in restitution and $65,000 in fines. He served almost 20 months in a satellite camp of the United States Penitentiary, Hazelton near Bruceton Mills, West Virginia, before transitioning to a halfway house in Lexington, Kentucky, on December 18, 2015. He was released from the halfway house on January 21, 2016 and is currently residing in Clay County. Early life Richard Dwight (\\"Richie\\") Farmer, Jr. was born on August 25, 1969, in Corbin, Kentucky, but grew up in the eastern Kentucky town of Manchester. He was the second of three children born to Richard and Virginia Farmer. Because of his physical maturity – he reportedly began shaving at age 12 and had begun wearing his trademark mustache by his junior year in high school – Farmer was frequently questioned about his age. The left-hander's vertical leap measured in high school. He credited his father, a transportation manager at a local coal mine and a standout point guard at Clay County High School in 1963, with developing his basketball acumen. As an eighth grader, Farmer played basketball for his grade school basketball team, as well as the freshman, junior varsity, and varsity teams at Clay County High School. He played sparingly during the varsity team's regular season but received 68 seconds of playing time – scoring 2 points – during the Tigers' victory over Owensboro High School in the 1984 Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA) State Basketball Championship. He also played football on a team that won the county championship that year. He eventually stopped playing football, but continued to play baseball – as a pitcher and first baseman – in addition to basketball until his senior year of high school. High school basketball Freshman and sophomore As a freshman, Farmer led his team in scoring during the regular season, averaging 16.4 points per game from the shooting guard position. He also led the Tigers in scoring in each of their three games en route to the 13th Region Kentucky High School Athletic Association basketball championship. In the opening round of the 1985 KHSAA state tournament, Farmer scored 14 points on 6 of 16 shooting in a win over Boone County High School. Then, in back-to-back victories against Metcalfe County High School and Doss High School, he led his team with 21 and 20 points, respectively, to help Clay County reach the tournament finals. Farmer scored 10 points in Clay County's 65–64 loss to Hopkinsville High School in the championship game. He was the tournament's second-highest scorer with 69 points, one behind Hopkinsville's Lamont Ware, and finished second in the voting for the tournament's Most Valuable Player, which went to Hopkinsville's Wendell Quarles. Only Apollo High School's Rex Chapman received more votes for the all-tournament team. Clay County ranked only behind Owensboro and Scott County High School in the Lexington Herald-Leader's 1985–86 preseason coaches poll. During Clay County's 22–6 regular season, Farmer, who moved to the point guard position, averaged 18.6 points, 10 assists, and 8 rebounds per game. The Tigers won the 13th District Title, setting up a matchup with Pulaski County High School in the first round of the KSHAA state tournament. Farmer had scored 30 points in Clay County's regular season matchup with Pulaski County, but his team lost by one point in overtime. In the tournament rematch, Pulaski County held Farmer to 20 points and won 83–78; Coach Dave Fraley credited a defense centered on stopping Farmer for his team's victory. Junior In the Lexington Herald- Leader's 1986–87 preseason coaches' poll, Clay County was ranked 14th in the state, and Farmer was named one of the state's best 25 players. Farmer led his team in scoring at 23.9 points per game, and Clay County finished the regular season with a record of 28–2 and again won the 13th Region tournament. Farmer scored 19 points and grabbed 5 rebounds in his team's 90–80 victory over Highlands High School in the KHSAA state tournament's opening round, but his performance was overshadowed by teammate Russell Chadwell's 43 points. In the quarterfinals, Farmer led the Tigers with 19 points, defeating LaRue County High School 62–56 in front of 24,041 spectators at Lexington's Rupp Arena, a record crowd for a high school basketball game. In the first half of Clay County's semi-final matchup with Madison Central High School, Farmer scored 18 and his younger brother, Russ, added 12 to account for 30 of their team's 39 first-half points. The Tigers' 17-point halftime lead grew to as many as 25 in the second half, and the elder Farmer again led his team with 24 total points in Clay County's 78–58 victory. The win over Madison Central set up a title game between Clay County and Louisville's Ballard High School. Clay County had only one starter taller than , while Ballard started four players taller than , including star shooting guard Allan Houston. The game featured 24 ties and 15 lead changes; neither team led by more than four points during regulation. Farmer scored Clay County's last 9 points in regulation, including consecutive go-ahead baskets at 3:19, 2:46, and 0:30. Ballard's Leonard Taylor scored on a put-back basket at the buzzer to tie the score at 65 and force overtime. Clay County never trailed in the overtime, and Farmer's jump shot with 1:44 left put the Tigers in the lead for good. The 76–73 win was Clay County's first- ever KHSAA state championship. Farmer played all 35 minutes of the game and led all scorers with 27 points to go with 6 rebounds and 4 assists. He was named to the all-tournament team, selected the tournament's Most Valuable Player, and given the Ted Sanford Award for citizenship, basketball ability, academic achievement, and sportsmanship. He was also the only underclassman named to the Lexington Herald-Leader's 1987 All-State First Team. In the summer following his junior year, Farmer was named to the Kentucky Junior All- Star Team, which played exhibition games throughout Europe, including stops in Iceland, the Netherlands, and West Germany. After the European trip, he helped lead Clay County to a 15–0 record in Amateur Athletic Union play. It was the first AAU season which recognized the three-point field goal, and Farmer made 53 of his 73 three-point attempts. In July 1987, the Kentucky Junior All-Stars finished second to a team from South Carolina in the Kentucky Prep All-Star Festival at Memorial Coliseum in Lexington; Farmer sat out the championship game with a hand injury he suffered in the previous game. Senior Clay County was ranked as the top team in the state in the 1987–88 preseason coaches' poll, and Farmer was voted the state's best prep prospect, garnering twice as many votes as second-place prospect Allan Houston. The Tigers started the year 8–0 before suffering their only regular season loss in the first game of the 1987 Beach Ball Classic against Eau Claire High School. In Clay County's next game in the Classic, Farmer broke the school's career scoring record, scoring his 2,193rd point in a 76–57 win over Tulsa, Oklahoma's Nathan Hale High School. Gary Gregory, who had held the record since 1974, was in attendance at the game. In the tournament's fifth place game, Farmer scored 33 points and broke the single-game record for assists with 16, besting Kenny Anderson's year-old record of 13. Clay County defeated Simi Valley High School 95–91, and Farmer was selected as the tournament's Outstanding Player and named to the all-tournament team. In the opening round of the January 1988 Louisville Invitational Tournament (LIT), Farmer scored 40 points on 15 of 30 shooting in an 86–82 win over Pleasure Ridge Park High School, pushing Clay County's record to 16–1 and setting up another meeting with Allan Houston's Ballard team. Farmer scored 39 points – including 14 of his 15 free throws – and grabbed 12 rebounds in Clay County's 92–88 double overtime victory. In the championship game against Bardstown High School, Farmer battled through fatigue and a thigh injury to lead his team in scoring with 24 points in an overtime win. In the three-game tournament, Farmer scored 103 points and played all of his team's 105 minutes, while committing only 4 turnovers. He was selected to the all-tournament team and named tournament MVP. Already being recruited by Western Kentucky, Alabama, and Notre Dame, Farmer's performances in the Beach Ball Classic and LIT brought notice from Eastern Kentucky, Wake Forest, Auburn, Louisville, and Kentucky. In the 49th District Championship game, Farmer broke Clay County's single-game scoring record with 51 points in a 101–59 win over Jackson County High School. In the 13th Region tournament opener, Farmer scored 40 points as Clay County defeated Corbin High School 75–56. Clay County went on to defeat Bell County High School 53–36 in the semi-finals and Knox Central High School 73–69 in the finals to once again advance to the KHSAA state tournament. Farmer scored 38 points on 14 of 24 shooting in a victory over Rowan County High School in the tournament's opening round. Four minutes into the Tigers' quarterfinal matchup against LaRue County High School, Farmer scored a three-point basket that tied Wallace \\"Wah Wah\\" Jones' record for most points scored by a single player in the KHSAA state tournament (223). Farmer went on to break the record, scoring 30 points in a 91–54 win. Farmer's 18 points in the semi-finals against Pleasure Ridge Park helped Clay County to a 92–90 win and a rematch in the title game against Ballard High School. Farmer set a title game record against Ballard, scoring 51 points on 20 of 32 shooting (including 9 of 14 from three-point range), but Clay County lost 88–79. Ron King set the previous title game record in 1969 with 44; only Kelly Coleman's 69-point performance in 1956 bested Farmer's 51 points in a tournament game. He was selected to the all-tournament team, received a Dawahares' Sweet Sixteen Academic Scholarship Award, and was voted the tournament's MVP. Following the state tournament, Farmer said he was contacted by LSU, Vanderbilt, Virginia, and Indiana in addition to schools who had previously recruited him. For the season, Farmer averaged 27.1 points, 6.4 rebounds and 8.7 assists per game, all career highs. The only player to play in the KHSAA state tournament five times, he finished his career with records for most points scored (317) and most field goals made (127) for a career in the tournament. He posted a total of 2,793 points in his high school career. He was named Kentucky Mr. Basketball, Kentucky Associated Press Male High School Athlete of the Year, and was the leading vote-getter for the Kentucky All-State Team, appearing on 160 of 167 ballots. The Clay County Judge/Executive renamed a road outside Farmer's hometown of Machester \\"Richie Boulevard\\". In a 1989 Lexington Herald-Leader poll of sportswriters and former high school coaches, Farmer was the near-unanimous choice as the best high school player in Kentucky during the 1980s. In May 1988, Farmer was selected to an AAU all-star team that played an exhibition game in Memorial Coliseum against an all-star team from the Soviet Union. He scored 17 points in a 107–93 win. In the first of two matchups with Indiana's All-Star team, the Kentucky All-Stars lost 102–82; Farmer had a bad shooting performance, going 5 of 18 from the field, including 2 of 9 from three-point range, for 15 points. In the rematch the following week, Farmer scored 19 points in a 112–100 loss. Recruitment Despite Farmer's prolific scoring, recruiters expressed concern about his small stature and lack of quickness. Even while lauding his skills, Lexington Herald-Leader sportswriter Mike Fields wrote that Farmer had \\"heavy legs and slow-going style\\". Regarding Farmer's size, Fields noted that, despite playing point guard, Farmer consistently jumped center for Clay County and could jump high enough to execute a two-handed slam dunk. The Herald- Leader's Billy Reed compared Farmer to Indiana's Steve Alford, who overcame doubts about his size, speed, and defense to become the Hoosiers' all-time leading scorer and lead them to an NCAA Championship in 1987. Kentucky was believed to be Farmer's school of choice, but coaches remained non-committal about his recruitment. The Wildcats had seven returning guards and small forwards – Rex Chapman, Eric Manuel, Deron Feldhaus, Derrick Miller, John Pelphrey, Johnathon Davis, and Sean Sutton – and two signed recruits at those positions – Sean Woods and Chris Mills. Conversely, four of their five frontcourt players – Winston Bennett, Rob Lock, Cedric Jenkins and Richard Madison – were graduating, and lone frontcourt signee Shawn Kemp had not yet qualified academically. On March 21, 1988, Farmer told a Lexington television station that he would no longer consider Kentucky if they did not offer him a scholarship by the weekend. A week later, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported that coach Eddie Sutton extended the offer but that Farmer planned to take official visits to Western Kentucky and Vanderbilt, and would host an in-home visit with LSU coach Dale Brown before deciding whether to accept Sutton's offer. In April, Farmer played shooting guard for the North team in the Kentucky Derby Festival Classic. He scored 14 points on 5 of 12 shooting and grabbed 3 rebounds, but his team lost to the South team 134–125. Among his teammates in the Classic was Kentucky signee Sean Woods, who told the Lexington Herald-Leader that he and Farmer had become good friends and that he hoped Farmer would choose to play for the Wildcats. The paper also reported that Farmer had narrowed his list of potential college choices to three: Western Kentucky, LSU, and Kentucky. Farmer took an official visit to Western Kentucky the weekend of April 9, 1988, but on April 14, the second day of the April signing period, he held a press conference at his high school gymnasium to announce that he had signed a National Letter of Intent with Kentucky. He told the assembled crowd, \\"[Playing for Kentucky has] been a dream of mine as long as I can remember. Even before kindergarten, I always wanted to play for Kentucky.\\" College basketball Freshman By the time Farmer arrived at Kentucky, the roster had been decimated. Standout shooting guard Rex Chapman entered the 1988 NBA Draft, ending his collegiate eligibility. Sophomore Eric Manuel was held out of basketball activities pending the outcome of an investigation into his ACT scores. Signees Shawn Kemp and Sean Woods failed to qualify academically, and Chris Mills was under investigation by the NCAA for cash allegedly sent to his father by assistant coach Dwane Casey in violation of the Association's amateurism rules. A viral illness forced Farmer to miss about a third of the team's preseason practices. Once he was able to practice, Coach Eddie Sutton related that he lacked the conditioning to finish most practices. The Lexington Herald-Leader's Jerry Tipton later reported that Farmer had to leave practice half an hour early two days a week to attend his American History class. Sutton also opined that Farmer's high school competition was inferior to that of Los Angeles native Mills, but Farmer's high school coach pointed out that, during Farmer's senior season, 20 of his team's games were against teams ranked in the top 20 in their respective states. In his first collegiate game, against Duke, Farmer played 7 minutes and air balled his only shot. After an early season loss to Notre Dame in the Big Four Classic dropped the Wildcats' record to 2–3, Sutton noted that Farmer, Sean Sutton, and LaRon Ellis had all missed practice time with the flu. After managing just 17 points in the Wildcats' first five games, Farmer scored 10 points in 20 minutes in the team's sixth game against Northwestern State. With 12 seconds to go in the game and Kentucky trailing 84–82, Farmer was whistled for an intentional foul on Northwestern State's Roman Banks while trying to draw a charge on an inbounds play. Banks maintained that Farmer had tugged Banks toward him and fallen down, attempting to draw the call, but Farmer and Sutton both denied the alleged chicanery. Banks hit one of two free throws, and Farmer missed a potentially game-tying three-point shot at the buzzer, dropping the Wildcats to 2–4 on the season. Farmer followed up with a 15-point performance in a win against Western Carolina. In the Kentucky Invitational Tournament, where Kentucky lost its opening round game to Bowling Green before winning the third-place game against Marshall, Farmer scored 12 points in each game. Farmer's sudden increase in scoring prompted complaints from the fan base that Sutton disliked Farmer and was limiting his minutes out of favoritism for his son, Sean. Some fans began to boo when Sutton, the team's starting point guard, returned to the game to replace Farmer. Farmer maintained that Sutton had treated him fairly, and Sutton cited lack of practice time as the reason for Farmer's limited playing time; in early January 1989, local media reported that Farmer had been limited in practice due to right knee pain. Questions about Farmer's playing time continued into Southeastern Conference play, even as Farmer's scoring also dropped off. By late January, Sutton publicly complained about the need for more scoring from the bench, which had produced only 29 points in the team's previous seven games. Lexington Herald-Leader columnist Billy Reed wrote: \\"Richie simply isn't ready to play at this level yet\\". Before a January game against Georgia, two-time former governor A. B. \\"Happy\\" Chandler presented Farmer with the 1988 Kentucky Sportsman of the Year Award. The youngest person and first high school athlete ever to win the award, Farmer finished ahead of former Kentucky guard Pat Riley, who had just coached the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers to a second consecutive championship. With the Wildcats' record sitting at 11–13 overall and 6–6 in conference play headed into a February road game against conference leader LSU, Farmer remained in Lexington with a combination of a stomach virus and the flu. Teammates LaRon Ellis, Chris Mills, and Derrick Miller had also been ill, but all recovered in time to make the trip. Farmer shot just 2 of 14 in limited minutes in the month of February. In Kentucky's final home game of the season, Farmer hit a three-pointer – his only points of the game – with two seconds left to lift the Wildcats to a 70–69 win over Ole Miss. The following game, Farmer missed a potentially game-winning jump shot at the buzzer in a 68–67 loss at Mississippi State to end the Wildcats' regular season. In its first game of the Southeastern Conference Tournament the next week, Kentucky lost to Vanderbilt 77–63 in a game where Farmer missed all four of his field goal attempts. Finishing with a 13–19 record – the team's worst record since the 1926–27 season – the Wildcats were not invited to any postseason tournament. At the team's annual postseason awards banquet, Farmer received the free throw award. Sophomore Between Farmer's freshman and second years, the NCAA banned Eric Manuel from playing in any further NCAA games because of questions about the legitimacy of his ACT scores and levied a two-year postseason ban, a one-year ban on televised games, and scholarship reductions against Kentucky as punishment for payments allegedly made to the father of Chris Mills. Mills was ruled ineligible to play at Kentucky and transferred to Arizona; Sean Sutton and LaRon Ellis also transferred to other schools in the wake of the sanctions. Eddie Sutton resigned and was replaced by New York Knicks head coach Rick Pitino. After recruit Henry Thomas suffered an off-season injury to his anterior cruciate ligament, Kentucky was left with just 8 scholarship players, none of whom were taller than . Rick Pitino replaced Eddie Sutton as Kentucky's coach in 1989. Pitino and newly hired strength and conditioning coach Rock Oliver instituted an intensive conditioning program. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that Farmer lost in the off-season, reducing his weight to , and Pitino praised his improved speed and endurance. Pitino also brought Billy Donovan – who played point guard on Pitino's teams at Providence – to Kentucky as a graduate assistant to mentor the team's two-point guards, Farmer and Sean Woods (now academically eligible). The team's first intra-squad scrimmage showcased Pitino's fast- paced, three-point-heavy style; the two teams combined to shoot 98-of-175 from the field, including 23-of-57 from three, as the Blue team defeated the White team 145–85. Farmer led the White team (the projected reserves) in scoring with 26 points, including 5-of-13 shooting from three-point range. In the next scrimmage, played at Farmer's alma mater, Clay County High School, Farmer scored 32 points, but the White team lost to the Blue team again, 125–117. The teams again combined for 175 shots, and Pitino said before the game that he wanted both teams to exceed 120 points. Farmer sat out much of the second half of the final scrimmage due to illness but scored 17 points on 5-of-16 shooting in a 124–120 victory for the White team. After Kentucky's second game of the year – a 71–69 loss at Indiana – Pitino noted that Farmer, who had 4 points and 4 assists in the game, was benefiting from extra one-on-one coaching sessions with Donovan. In a December 19, 1989, victory against Furman, Farmer attempted 7 three-pointers – tied for second-most in the game – as the Wildcats set an NCAA record for most three-pointers attempted in a game with 47, besting their own record of 41 set earlier in the month against Tennessee Tech. A week later, Farmer set a career-high in points with 21 – including three made three-pointers – as the Wildcats set records for the most three- pointers made in a single game (21) and most points ever scored against North Carolina, but lost the game 121–110. After the game, Pitino opined that Farmer \\"holds back a little bit\\" and noted that he would expect Farmer to work hard in the off-season to reach his potential. The Wildcats closed out 1989 with a closer-than-expected 86–79 loss against eighth-ranked Louisville, but local sportswriter John McGill said Farmer had his best game to date with 10 points, 9 assists and 3 steals off the bench. In a January 20, 1990, contest against conference foe Tennessee, Pitino benched senior shooting guard Derrick Miller to start the second half, giving his spot to Farmer. Farmer, who had no assists and 4 turnovers in nine minutes during the first half, responded with 7 assists and only one turnover in the second half. Miller, who entered the game with 17:38 left, scored 17 points in the second half as the Wildcats turned a 44–39 halftime deficit into a 95–83 win. Miller credited Pitino's decision to bring him off the bench in the second half with taking the pressure off him and helping him get more comfortable in the game. After a mid-week loss to Auburn, Pitino announced that he would move Farmer into the starting lineup, replacing Sean Woods, for the Wildcats' January 27 contest against Ole Miss. \\"We will change the lineup to try to get more concentration. We'll try Richie Farmer at the point and see what we get out of that. Right now we're not getting too much out of that position,\\" Pitino told reporters during an SEC teleconference. In a 98–79 victory, Farmer tallied 11 points, 2 assists and no turnovers in 24 minutes; Woods registered 8 points, 4 assists, and 2 turnovers in 23 minutes off the bench. Pitino said practice performance would determine whether Woods or Farmer would start the Wildcats' next game against Mississippi State, and he ultimately decided to return Woods to the starting rotation. On February 15, 1990, in front of a record 24,301 fans at Rupp Arena, Farmer hit six consecutive free throws to help Kentucky overcome a career-high 41 points by LSU's Chris Jackson and pull within a half-game of first place in the SEC with a 100–95 win. Farmer entered the game after Sean Woods fouled out with 1:54 left, and with Kentucky leading by two with just over a minute left, LSU coach Dale Brown instructed his team to foul Farmer on each Kentucky possession to conserve the game clock and regain possession of the ball. \\"We felt Farmer did not have much experience, and he was playing a little tight,\\" Brown said after the game. Told of Brown's instructions to foul Farmer – the team's best free throw shooter at 86% – during a post-game interview, Pitino expressed surprise. \\"[Brown] said he purposely wanted to foul Richie Farmer? What was his reason? ... If I had to pick a guy to shoot it in front of 50,000 people with your life at stake, it's going to be Richie Farmer shooting that free throw.\\" Less than two minutes into a subsequent game at Alabama, Farmer and walk-on Tony Cooper both left the bench when Kentucky's Reggie Hanson and Alabama's Robert Horry engaged in a fist-fight. Hansen, Horry and Cooper were all ejected, but Farmer was not. Asked about the difference in penalties for Cooper and Farmer, official Don Ferguson admitted he did not want to hurt Kentucky's shallow rotation any further by ejecting another regular contributor. As a token of appreciation to the fans, after the Wildcats' February 24 \\"Senior day\\" win over Auburn, Pitino called his players back onto the floor and presented the individual awards usually reserved for the team's annual awards banquet. Farmer received the \\"Best Free Throw Shooter\\" award. For the season, he averaged 7.0 points per game. Fans and the media nicknamed the team \\"Pitino's Bombinos\\" for their fast-paced offense that relied heavily on the three-point shot, which contrasted sharply with the more deliberate offensive schemes run by Pitino's immediate predecessors, Joe B. Hall and Eddie Sutton. Junior In September 1990, Farmer had a disagreement with strength coach Rock Oliver, returned home to Manchester, and considered leaving the Kentucky basketball team. Pitino, who was away from campus on a recruiting visit, called Farmer and scheduled a meeting with him for the following weekend, after which Farmer decided to return to the team. Pitino characterized the incident as \\"a case of someone getting down and needing a couple of hugs to get their spirits lifted a little bit\\". Pitino later added that he thought the transfer of point guard Travis Ford from Missouri – bringing additional competition in the backcourt for the 1991–92 season – may have played into Farmer's brief departure. Pitino expressed uncertainty entering the season about who would replace Derrick Miller as the team's starting shooting guard. Farmer was the leading candidate until suffering a bruised kidney during a public intra-squad scrimmage in early November and reaggravating the injury during another public scrimmage days later. Sophomore Jeff Brassow got the start for the Wildcats in their season opening win against Penn. Farmer scored 12 points off the bench – one of six Wildcats with double-digit points – but left the game with 3:17 remaining after taking an inadvertent elbow in the back. In the next game against Cincinnati, Farmer briefly replaced starter Sean Woods at point guard after Woods committed eight turnovers in the first half, but Farmer fared little better, committing two turnovers and uncharacteristically missing two consecutive free throws. In the second half, after Woods picked up his fourth foul, Farmer entered the game and provided steady leadership to preserve a 75–71 win. In the Wildcats' third game of the year – a win over Notre Dame in the Big Four Classic – Farmer led the team in scoring with 19 points on 7-of-11 shooting; he added 4 assists and 2 steals against no turnovers in 23 minutes of play. Prior to Kentucky's December 15 matchup against Chattanooga, Pitino publicly contemplated starting Farmer in place of Sean Woods at point and either Carlos Toomer or Jody Thompson at shooting guard instead of Brassow. The day of the game, he announced Farmer would make the second start of his career at shooting guard alongside Woods at point. Although he tied with Pelphrey for a team-high 17 points, Farmer returned to the bench for the following game against Indiana because Pitino felt he didn't have the size to defend the Hoosiers' bigger guards. In a December 22, 1990, win against in- state rival Western Kentucky, Farmer posted a new career high with 22 points, despite missing his first five three-point attempts of the game. He would not approach such scoring numbers again until a February 3, 1991, contest against Georgia, when he scored 16 points after seeing extended minutes due to Woods being in foul trouble. Farmer suffered a black eye during the game, which was notable for its physicality. Messenger-Inquirer sportswriter Jake Jennings also noted that Farmer relied on drives to the basket to score, as opposed to his usual penchant for shooting three-point shots. Before Kentucky's February 13 game against Tennessee, Woods was hospitalized with an \\"acute viral illness\\". Farmer started in his place, tallying 14 points and 7 rebounds in an 85–74 win. Although Farmer also started the next game against Ole Miss, just 48 seconds into the game his knee made contact with an opponent's knee, sending him to the locker room and Woods into the game. Farmer returned to score a team-high 21 points, but also suffered a scratched eye, in a win that gave Kentucky the best record in the SEC; Woods logged 9 points and 7 assists in almost 24 minutes of action off the bench. Woods returned to the starting lineup in Kentucky's next game at Vanderbilt, but Farmer remained a starter as well, replacing Jeff Brassow at shooting guard. He scored 13 of his team-high 19 in the first half, but Kentucky lost the game 98–87. Pitino characterized Farmer as \\"exhausted\\" in the second half, playing heavy minutes in relief of Woods, who managed only 15 minutes before fouling out. Two games later, Farmer hit four of his first five shots – including three 3-pointers – and finished with a team-high 16 in a win against Alabama. Farmer notched 20 points – one behind team leader Jamal Mashburn – in Kentucky's final game of the season, a 114–93 win over Auburn. The win pushed Kentucky to a conference-best 14–4 record, but an SEC rule forbade declaring a team the regular season champion if they were ineligible for postseason play, as Kentucky was. Farmer was one of five players to average double-digit points per game (10.1); it was the first time since Kentucky's 1977–78 championship team that so many players had averaged double-digit scoring. At the team's postseason awards banquet, Farmer received the Free Throw Award for the third straight year and was also named the team's Most Improved Player. Pitino named the four rising seniors – Farmer, Pelphrey, Woods, and Feldhaus – co-captains for the upcoming season. Senior Shortly after the team's first practice in October 1991, Pitino again commented on Farmer's improved conditioning, calling it his \\"biggest surprise\\" of the early practices. He also announced that seniors Sean Woods and John Pelphrey would join Jamal Mashburn in the starting lineup – as the team's point guard, small forward, and power forward, respectively – while senior Deron Feldhaus would reprise his \\"sixth man\\" role from the previous season. Farmer was projected to compete with junior college transfer Dale Brown for the starting shooting guard spot. At the team's annual Midnight Madness scrimmage, Farmer joined the announced starters and sophomore Gimel Martinez on the Blue team, which defeated the White team 67–54. Farmer had 18 points, including 4 of 6 made three-point baskets. Forbidden from holding off- campus scrimmages by new NCAA regulations, Kentucky played its only public preseason scrimmage in Memorial Coliseum; Farmer joined the White team, scoring 21 points on 6-of-12 shooting in a losing effort. Suffering from the flu, Farmer did not play in the Wildcats' season-opening win against West Virginia in the Preseason NIT. He played in the following game, but missed all seven of his shots as Kentucky was eliminated from the tournament by Pitt 85–67, the team's worst home loss since 1988. Farmer came off the bench in the Wildcats' next game – a 90–69 win over UMass – but matched his career-high with 22 points, including a perfect 10-of-10 from the free throw line; he saw extended minutes in the game due to a season-ending knee injury to Jeff Brassow. UMass coach John Calipari called Farmer \\"the difference in the game\\". During the non-conference season, Farmer made notable plays late in important games, including a game-clinching rebound against Indiana and a key three- pointer in the waning minutes of a game against Ohio. In a January 2, 1992, game against Notre Dame, Farmer entered the game after just three minutes when starter Dale Brown sprained his ankle. In the first half, he equaled his career high of 22 points – including five three-point baskets – en route to a new career-high of 28 in a 91–70 victory. This performance notwithstanding, complaints from the fan base about Farmer's lack of playing time – he averaged 17.7 minutes per game through early February – grew louder and eventually became the subject of media interest. In January, two of Kentucky's smaller newspapers printed articles on the subject – one speculating that Pitino was intentionally holding Farmer back so Farmer's popularity wouldn't eclipse his own. Kentucky beat writer Jerry Tipton addressed the topic at length in a Lexington Herald-Leader column on February 8, drawing a rebuke from Pitino, who called the issue a \\"non-story\\". In late January, shortly before the Tipton article appeared, Pitino decided to start Farmer against Ole Miss. He believed starting Woods and bringing Brown off the bench would allow him to have one of his two best defenders on the floor more often; he also believed Farmer's height would not be a liability against Ole Miss' smaller starting guards. Farmer scored 10 points on 4-of-10 shooting and led the team with 6 rebounds in a 96–78 victory. Pitino then decided to start Farmer and fellow reserve Deron Feldhaus in Kentucky's next game against LSU, hoping to draw Tigers center Shaquille O'Neal farther from the basket by starting better shooters. The strategy was not successful – Farmer shot 2-of-9 and Feldhaus 1-of-10 in a 74–53 loss – but Pitino announced that Farmer would continue to start because he was exhibiting more shooting confidence than Kentucky's other guards. Farmer responded with 16 points, including four 3-pointers, in an 85–67 victory over Auburn. He continued to start for the Wildcats for the rest of the regular season, culminating in a Senior day win against Tennessee, when he scored 11 of Kentucky's first 16 points and saw extended minutes after fellow senior Sean Woods was ejected for fighting with the Volunteers' Jay Price. With the team's probation over, Farmer and the other three seniors played in their first – and only – postseason games in the 1991–92 season. After an opening round win against Vanderbilt in the SEC Tournament in Birmingham, Alabama, Kentucky won its third meeting of the season with LSU 80–74 in the second round; the Tigers were without star center Shaquille O'Neal, who was suspended for fighting with Tennessee's Carlus Groves in his team's opening round victory. In the finals, Kentucky faced three-time defending tournament champion Alabama, which was without forward Andre Perry, who suffered a broken foot in the semi-finals against Arkansas. Star sophomore Jamal Mashburn led all scorers with 28 points on 12-of-14 shooting, en route to an 80–54 victory and tournament Most Valuable Player honors. Mashburn, who shot 26-for-31 in the Wildcats' three tournament games, said of his performance, \\"At the beginning of the season, I told the four seniors 'this is the only thing I can give you. I can't give you any presents, but I can give you an SEC championship. We gave them a present they really deserved.\\" Kentucky was seeded second in the East Region of the 1992 NCAA Tourment. The Wildcats held a narrow 62–59 lead with 8:25 to play in their first round matchup against Colonial Athletic Association champion Old Dominion when Farmer hit a layup that keyed a decisive four-and-a-half-minute, 15–2 run, helping Kentucky to an 88–69 victory. Kentucky's next game, against Iowa State, was decided at the free throw line. Kentucky was called for 29 fouls in the game, and Iowa State hit 34-of-38 free throws, but in the final 1:27 of the game, Kentucky shot 14 free throws – making 11 – to win the game 106–98. Farmer, who finished with 14 points, hit four consecutive free throws in the final minute of the game. After the game, Pitino commented, \\"If not for Richie Farmer, we don't win the game.\\" In the regional semi-finals, the Wildcats faced a rematch with third- seeded UMass. After the Minutemen cut a 20-point Kentucky lead to 2 with almost six minutes remaining in the game, UMass coach John Calipari was whistled for a technical foul for leaving the coach's box while arguing that one of his players had been fouled on a loose ball rebound; Farmer, who finished with 7 points, made the resulting free throws, starting an 11–2 run that helped Kentucky to an 87–77 win. Farmer's jersey hangs in the rafters at Rupp Arena. In the regional finals, Kentucky trailed top-seeded Duke by 12 in the second half, but battled back to force overtime. With 2.1 seconds left in overtime, Sean Woods hit a running bank shot to put Kentucky up one. Then, Duke's Christian Laettner caught a long inbounds pass, faked right, and hit a shot at the buzzer to give Duke the 104–103 victory. The game, which ended Farmer's playing career, is widely regarded as one of the greatest college basketball games of all time. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski later recalled, \\"The thing I'll always remember about that game is Richie Farmer's face as the ball went in. That, to me, helped me to have a better understanding of that game. ... To me, that was the deepest emotion that was on the court, the emotion that was on Richie Farmer's face.\\" Describing the impact of the game, Jerry Tipton wrote, \\"On one fateful night, the Cats obliterated any lingering association with $1,000 packages and academic fraud. Alluring images of courage, honest effort and heartracing excitement became symbols of UK basketball.\\" Local media gave the seniors the nickname \\"The Unforgettables\\". Collectively, they were voted as the Lexington Herald-Leader's 1992 Sportsmen of the Year. At the team's annual awards night, Farmer won the award for fewest turnovers per minute played (32 in 705 minutes), but the free throw award – won by Farmer the previous three years – went to Gimel Martinez. Athletics director C. M. Newton surprised the four seniors by hanging their jerseys in the rafters at Rupp Arena. In so doing, he violated the standards for the honor set by former athletics director Cliff Hagan. Those guidelines held that honorees must have completed a degree from the university and be at least 10 years removed from the end of their athletic eligibility. Newton cited the seniors' \\"unusual and outstanding contributions\\" to the program as reasons to make an exception to the standards, adding, \\"I won't say there never will be another exception, but the likelihood of another is not great.\\" Sportscaster Cris Collinsworth protested Newton's action because it honored the seniors before other program standouts like Kyle Macy and Rick Robey. After the season, the four seniors participated in a 21-city barnstorming tour of the state, playing against a group of local players in each city. At the game in Farmer's hometown of Manchester, Farmer scored 107 points for the seniors' team before switching to the Clay County team for the remainder of the game, hitting an additional three-pointer for a total of 30. Pelphrey hit a three to give the seniors – without Farmer – a 179–176 lead with 25 seconds left in the game, and the three seniors triple-teamed Farmer to prevent him from getting a shot off to tie the game. Twenty percent of the proceeds from each game benefited local charities, and another twenty percent of the total proceeds from the tour was divided between the University of Kentucky Library Fund, Big Brothers Big Sisters, and AIDS Volunteers of Lexington. Post- playing career In August 1992, Antex Publishing of Lexington released Farmer's autobiography entitled Richie. In addition to the standard printing, the publisher offered a special edition of the book in which direct quotes from Farmer were rendered in blue type, similar to the words of Jesus in red letter editions of the Bible. Long-time Wildcats radio broadcaster Cawood Ledford wrote the book's foreword. By the end of October, the book had sold 30,000 copies, and a second printing from the publisher was ordered. Farmer participated in several book signings across the state, as well as filming television advertisements for local products and conducting speaking engagements for dental insurance provider Delta Dental to promote good oral health in his native eastern Kentucky. Farmer continued taking classes at Kentucky with support from the Cawood Ledford Scholarship fund – designated to help University of Kentucky athletes who have exhausted their athletic eligibility finish their degrees – and in 1995, earned a bachelor of science degree with a double major in agricultural economics and agribusiness management. After graduation, he briefly worked in sports marketing in Lexington before returning to Manchester to join his father in the insurance business. In addition to selling insurance, Farmer also got his securities license to sell annuities, and eventually rose to become vice-president of Kentucky Financial Group. On April 15, 1998, Farmer married Rebecca Ann Morgan. The couple had three sons – Richard III (\\"Trey\\") and Ryan, born on November 30 in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and Tate, born in 2001. Farmer was inducted into the KHSAA Hall of Fame in 1998 and the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame in 2002. He was one of 88 inaugural members of the University of Kentucky Athletics Hall of Fame in 2005 and one of 16 inaugural members of the Kentucky High School Basketball Hall of Fame in 2012. \\"The Unforgettables\\" were honored on a limited edition collector's bottle of Maker's Mark bourbon in 2007. Political career First term as Commissioner of Agriculture On January 28, 2003, Farmer announced he would seek the Republican nomination for Kentucky Agriculture Commissioner. In his announcement, he acknowledged that he had never operated a farm, but noted that he knew many farmers and held a degree in an agriculture-related field. Ellen Williams, chair of the state's Republican Party, said Farmer's candidacy would bring \\"star quality\\" to a down-ballot race (i.e. state offices other than governor and lieutenant governor). No Republican had been elected to any of those offices since 1967. Farmer waited until three weeks before the primary election to begin seriously campaigning and focused on population centers such as Lexington, Louisville, Bowling Green, and the Northern Kentucky area, where Republican voters were more concentrated. At that time, campaign finance reports showed that Farmer had spent about half of the $36,055 raised for his campaign, while his opponent, Leonard \\"Buck\\" Beasley, had raised only $450 and spent nothing. While he proposed no major changes to the operation of the agriculture department, Farmer emphasized teamwork as a means to improve the state's agricultural sector, cited the need to find new markets for Kentucky agricultural products, and expressed a desire to improve the public perception of the agriculture industry, saying \\"Farmers have a great story to tell, and I will use any name recognition I have gained through my experience with UK basketball to help them tell it.\\" He also raised the possibility of engaging other former basketball players to promote the work of the agriculture department and indicated that he would lobby to have half of Kentucky's allocation of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement directed to the state's Agriculture Development Board. With 109,742 votes – 79 percent of the total cast – Farmer garnered more votes than any other Republican candidate for any office on the ballot en route to winning the nomination. The victory set up a general election contest against Democratic nominee Alice Woods Baesler, a state agriculture department aide and wife of former Congressman and Kentucky basketball player Scotty Baesler. Bolstered by his significantly higher name recognition, Farmer led an early July SurveyUSA poll 61% to 33% over Baesler. Baesler charged that Farmer was unqualified for the job of agriculture commissioner and that his high poll numbers and convincing primary victory were driven by his popularity as a basketball player, criticizing him for featuring his status as a member of \\"The Unforgettables\\" in his campaign literature. Farmer responded that his college degree qualified him to be agriculture commissioner and said his need to continue his day job to support his family often kept him away from the campaign trail where he could expound more on his ideas for running the Department of Agriculture. At an August debate in Owensboro, Farmer proposed the cross-promotion of Kentucky agricultural products and the state park system, awarding points for buying Kentucky produced groceries that could be redeemed for souvenirs and perks during stays at state parks. On October 21, The Kentucky Post gave Baesler its endorsement, contrasting her experience running a farm and her involvement with the agriculture department to Farmer's lack of agriculture experience and frequent absence at campaign events. Later that week, the Lexington Herald- Leader also endorsed Baesler, and followed up the next day with an article noting that, as of October 3, nearly one-third of the $87,825.20 Farmer had spent during the campaign went to relatives – including his parents, brother, sister, and in-laws – for salaries and campaign-related reimbursements. Interviewed by phone, Farmer responded, \\"[My family has] probably worked 60, 70, 80 hours a week campaigning for me trying to get me elected. I don't think we have done anything wrong.\\" Richard Beliles, chairman of campaign finance watchdog Common Cause of Kentucky, said Farmer's actions were not illegal but were \\"rather odd\\". Farmer overcame the bad press, however, to take the election by a vote of 575,049 to 466,321. In April 2004, Farmer announced the formation of a committee to study the effectiveness of state owned and operated farmer's markets. In June 2005, he was elected secretary of the Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture; in 2007, he was elected president of the organization. Farmer also sought to prevent an outbreak of vesicular stomatitis virus in the state's horses and cattle by banning the import of animals from 20 western counties where the virus was known to have infected animals. On Farmer's advice, Governor Ernie Fletcher requested that the United States Department of Agriculture designate Kentucky as an agricultural disaster area after an April 2007 cold snap devastated the state's fruit and wheat crops; the designation made Kentucky farmers eligible for low-interest federal loans to help compensate for their lost crop revenue. In December 2004, Kentucky's Registry of Election Finance, the agency that enforces the state's campaign finance laws, hired Farmer's sister, Rhonda F. Gray, who had previously served as chair of her brother's campaign for agriculture commissioner. Registry chair John Rogers maintained that Gray was hired on her own merits, and Gray promised to recuse herself from any work that might involve her brother's future campaigns. The following May, The Kentucky Post published excerpts from an email from Dick Murgatroyd, Fletcher's deputy chief of staff, to Transportation Cabinet officials asking them to find a job for Farmer's brother-in-law, Jamie Gray; the email indicated that Murgatroyd was responsible for finding jobs for both James and Rhonda Gray. Gray was later hired as an administrative specialist in the Transportation Cabinet. Farmer denied any involvement in the hiring decisions beyond submitting recommendations for both candidates. In July, Murgatroyd was indicted on 19 counts of violating the state's merit system by making politically motivated hires, including that of Jamie Gray. A transportation official testified in September that Farmer had declined one job for Gray because the salary was too low and had negotiated a higher salary on the job Gray eventually got. Farmer called the claims \\"ludicrous\\" and \\"simply not true\\". Second term as Commissioner of Agriculture Following the resignation of Lieutenant Governor Steve Pence in June 2006, Farmer was mentioned as a possible running mate for Fletcher in his upcoming re-election campaign, but Fletcher chose Robbie Rudolph instead, and Farmer announced his intent to seek re-election as agriculture commissioner. In the Republican primary, Farmer faced Don Stosberg, a former budget analyst for Kentucky's Legislative Research Commission. Again, Farmer was criticized for failing to appear at several campaign events; Stosberg told the Lexington Herald-Leader, \\"[Farmer is] famous for three things: shooting three-point shots, not returning phone calls and not showing up.\\" Farmer responded that he was carrying out the duties of his office during his absences from the events. Farmer countered his absences by outspending his opponent 35-to-1, investing a reported $102,000 in his campaign. Farmer captured 85% of the vote, defeating Stosberg by a vote of 155,576 to 26,897. Name recognition played a role in both parties' primaries: Farmer enjoyed high name recognition from his days as a basketball player, while the Democratic nominee, David Lynn Williams, had a name similar to that of Kentucky Senate President David L. Williams. Shortly after the primary election, Williams made a series of politically unsavvy remarks in an interview published by a weekly online magazine devoted to Kentucky agricultural issues; among the gaffes were calling the state agricultural development board and long-time Kentucky Democratic Senator Wendell H. Ford \\"a bunch of damn liars\\". State Democratic chairman Jonathan Miller called Williams' statements \\"offensive\\" and said that several of the party's executive committee members desired to have Williams removed as the party's candidate. In June, Williams was arrested on misdemeanor charges of menacing, disorderly conduct, and harassment for allegedly threatening his niece, who was the city clerk of Glasgow, Kentucky, because she did not produce records he had requested under Kentucky's open records law. His trial was not scheduled until after the election. By October, a Research 2000 poll showed Farmer leading the race 54–35%, with 11% undecided, and campaign finance documents showed that Farmer had spent $57,075 of the $168,650 he raised for his general election campaign, while Williams had raised and spent less than $1,000. The Lexington Herald-Leader made no endorsement in the race, stating that Farmer's lack of knowledge was obvious during his first term, but that he \\"looks like a farm-policy genius\\" compared to Williams. On election day, Farmer set a record for the most votes received in an election for a constitutional office in Kentucky, garnering 641,789 (64%) to Williams' 363,188 (36%). During his victory speech, Farmer denied rumors that he was considering switching his affiliation to the Democratic Party. Farmer asked U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack for declarations of agricultural disasters in the wake of an ice storm in January 2009 that endangered the state's livestock and flooding that affected Kentucky Lake in 2010, damaging large portions of the state's corn, soybean, and wheat crops. In December 2010, he launched a joint investigation with Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway into claims that the Eastern Livestock company had not paid Kentucky cattlemen for $130 million in livestock. Bid for lieutenant governor Farmer was limited to two terms by the Kentucky Constitution, and in October 2009, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported that he was \\"in discussions\\" about running for governor in the 2011 election. In August 2010, Farmer announced that he would be \\"running for something\\" in the upcoming election and would announce his plans within weeks after the Kentucky State Fair. The Lexington Herald-Leader speculated that Farmer could run for governor, secretary of state, or lieutenant governor on a ticket with Senate President David Williams. On September 1, 2010, Williams and Farmer announced that they would run as a ticket for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively. Shortly after the announcement, Farmer began to face criticism for his use of state funds during difficult economic times that resulted in austerity measures in most state government agencies. One such criticism involved the attendance of Farmer and three aides at the Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture's 2010 annual meeting in St. Croix at a cost of $10,000. Another involved the approval of merit raises for eleven agriculture department employees in 2010 when workers in all other state government agencies received no cost of living salary increases and were required to take six unpaid furlough days. A department spokesman said the employees had taken on responsibilities for multiple jobs left unfilled by attrition. \\"The thought process was that this was more cost-effective than hiring new people,\\" the spokesman said. Every constitutional officer in the state also donated a day's salary to the state treasury or to a charity on each of the mandatory furlough days, but Farmer refused, saying he opposed the entire concept of furlough days for government workers. After significant public criticism, Farmer apologized and decided to donate six days' worth of his salary to charity. Farmer was also criticized for his management of the agriculture department's vehicle fleet. Late in his first term, Farmer had removed the vehicles used by the Agriculture Department from the state fleet, opting to have department officials manage them separately. In 2010, the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a free market think tank, criticized the department's management of the vehicles under its control, citing the frequency with which the department's vehicles were being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted in 2010 that the department's fleet had grown from 178 to 206 vehicles since 2007 while the state's fleet had shrunk by 5%, and that all but three of the department's vehicles were fewer than four years old. A department spokesman defended the moves, citing decreased maintenance costs and higher resale values of vehicles being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that such incidents could undermine Williams and Farmer's traditional Republican message of the need for less government spending. Farmer's wife Rebecca filed for divorce on April 5, 2011, claiming in court documents that she had no access to the family's finances except the salary she earned as a teacher's aide. On April 12, Farmer petitioned the court to dismiss his wife's divorce petition, contesting the idea that their marriage was irretrievably broken. The divorce proceedings were put on hold by mutual consent on May 26, 2011, but in a July 12 hearing, Farmer's wife asked that the judge schedule a trial date; the judge ordered mediation within 30 days instead. The mediation failed, and a trial date was set for November 22, shortly after the gubernatorial election. A second round of mediation shortly before the scheduled hearing resulted in a settlement between the parties; terms of the settlement were kept private. In the Republican gubernatorial primary, the Williams-Farmer ticket defeated businessman Phil Moffett and former Jefferson County Judge/Executive Bobbie Holsclaw. Williams and Farmer had led in opinion polling throughout the entire campaign, and neither opposing slate was able to raise enough money to engage in statewide television advertising; despite this, Williams and Farmer received only 68,502 votes, 48.2% of those cast. Holsclaw won the voting in her home county of Jefferson, which contains the city of Louisville and is the state's most populous. Moffett, a Tea Party favorite, carried the second most populous county, Fayette (which contains Lexington), as well as heavily-populated Daviess, McCracken, and Warren counties, and several counties in Northern and Central Kentucky. Questions about Farmer's use of taxpayer funds continued to dog him throughout the general election campaign. Democrats demanded that Farmer reimburse the state for hotel expenses charged to the state while Farmer was conducting outreach activities at the KHSAA state basketball tournament and the Kentucky State Fair, both located fewer than from his home. In May, the office of Democratic State Auditor Crit Luallen notified the Internal Revenue Service that Farmer had failed to report personal use of his state vehicle as income. A spokesman for Farmer's office said that the personal mileage had been tracked, but a department employee had failed to forward it to the state Personnel Cabinet for reporting; he added that Farmer would file amended tax documents and have deductions taken from his wages to settle the tax liability. The state Democratic Party filed an ethics complaint against Farmer in September based on an anonymous email sent to the Personnel Cabinet claiming that, after work hours, Farmer directed an agriculture department employee to purchase a small refrigerator with state funds and deliver it to Farmer's house. A department spokesman said Farmer spent a substantial amount of time working from a home office in 2010 due to a back injury and that the refrigerator had been moved to department offices in 2011. Beshear and Abramson easily defeated Farmer and Williams, carrying 90 of Kentucky's 120 counties. Days later, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported that Farmer had placed his girlfriend in a non-merit agriculture department job on October 31, 2011. Williams confirmed that the woman was Farmer's girlfriend, but denied knowledge that she had been put on the state payroll. Farmer defended the hiring, saying his girlfriend was qualified for the job, which involved administrative and clerical tasks, and that his legal team had assured him that he had followed all appropriate hiring regulations. Farmer's successor, Republican James Comer, fired Farmer's girlfriend a day after being sworn into office. Post-political life Investigations Five days after Farmer left office, Comer announced that he had requested a full audit of the department by newly elected Democratic State Auditor Adam Edelen. Among the items Comer asked Edelen to investigate were 171 items of missing agriculture department property valued at about $334,000 and another 103 items worth about $146,000 that were supposed to be returned to the state as surplus but could not be accounted for. A week later, Farmer returned some of the missing items. Comer and Edelen released the report on their joint probe on April 30, 2012. It detailed a \\"toxic culture of entitlement\\" in the agriculture department under Farmer, charging that he had required state employees to conduct personal errands while on the clock, failed to report gifts in excess of $200 as required by state ethics laws, and signed timesheets authorizing payment to friends in the department – including his girlfriend – who had performed very little if any work. Edelen confirmed that his investigation indicated that laws had been broken, and the report was turned over to the state attorney general for investigation. Minutes after the report was released, Farmer's lawyer made a public statement in which he opined, \\"I don't see anything in this audit report that any law-enforcement agency is going to be excited about.\\" He conceded that Farmer had declined to be interviewed during the investigation but felt it was unfair that Farmer was not given a chance to review or comment on the final report prior to its release. A week after the audit results were released, Kentucky's Executive Branch Ethics Commission reported that Farmer was the only constitutional officer who had failed to file a required disclosure of his 2011 finances by the required April 16 deadline. Farmer's attorney said the omission was \\"simply a matter of oversight on Richie's part given with [sic] what all has been going on.\\" Days later, First National Bank of Manchester filed a foreclosure suit against Farmer, alleging that no payments had been made on his $300,000 home mortgage since January 2012. Under terms of his pending divorce, Farmer was solely responsible for the mortgage on the house. The divorce was finalized in July, and on September 24, 2012, the house was sold at auction after Farmer was not successful in selling it himself. Earlier that week, a judge denied Farmer's request to reduce his child support payments, which were based on his salary as agriculture commissioner. Farmer, who had not been employed since leaving office in January 2012, told the court that the investigation into his tenure as agriculture commissioner had made it difficult to find employment. The judge found that Farmer was \\"voluntarily underemployed\\", although he suspended the child support payments for the months of September and October 2012 in light of Farmer's recovery from an August 30 hip replacement surgery. On November 9, 2012, the Lexington Herald- Leader reported that Farmer had found employment at a car dealership in Manchester. Charges filed On March 18, 2013, the Kentucky Executive Branch Ethics Commission charged Farmer with 42 state ethics violations, the most ever registered against a single individual; the previous high was 16. Most of the charges against him stemmed from the previous year's auditor's report, but previously unreported charges included conspiring with his sister Rhonda, who was also charged, to falsify records submitted to Rhonda's employer, the Registry of Election Finance. Farmer's girlfriend was also charged for falsifying timesheets. These charges were followed by five indictments by a federal grand jury on April 19, 2013, alleging four counts of converting state funds and property to personal use and one count of soliciting a bribe in exchange for a state grant. U.S. Attorney Kerry B. Harvey said a federal investigation revealed that Farmer had created jobs in the department for his friends and girlfriend, who conducted personal errands for Farmer – including \\"building a basketball court for Farmer, placing flooring in Farmer's attic and organizing Farmer's personal effects\\" – while on the clock. He also said that Farmer had kept some of the gifts ordered in conjunction with the 2008 Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture conference for his own use and allowed his family to stay in hotel rooms reserved for agriculture department employees at the Kentucky State Fair. The indictment did not specify what bribe was sought in exchange for a grant to conduct an all-terrain vehicle safety class, but the charges from the state Ethics Commission mentioned that Farmer had received three all-terrain vehicles in exchange for awarding unspecified state grants. A Lexington Herald-Leader report noted that the indictment only included events from 2008 forward because the statute of limitations had expired for any actions prior to 2008. Farmer pled not guilty to all five federal charges on April 25, 2013. He was released on his own recognizance, and his trial date was set for July 2. U.S. Magistrate Robert Wier denied Farmer's request to leave the country in May to celebrate his girlfriend's 40th birthday in Cancún, Mexico. Wier also ordered the recently unemployed Farmer to seek employment, surrender his passport, and remain within the state until the trial. In response to Farmer's lawyer's request to delay the trial until February 2014 – a request the prosecution called \\"excessive\\" – Judge Gregory Van Tatenhove rescheduled the trial for October 22. Plea bargain and sentencing On September 5, 2013, Farmer's attorney filed a motion to allow Farmer to change his plea to guilty and announced that Farmer had reached a plea bargain to settle all federal and state charges against him. Farmer would have faced maximum penalties of $250,000 and 10 years in prison for each federal charge against him. Instead, in exchange for his guilty plea, prosecutors agreed to pursue a sentence of 21 to 27 months in federal prison and $120,500 in restitution of the $450,000 Farmer was accused of misappropriating. Additionally, Farmer pleaded guilty to one state charge of violating campaign finance laws in exchange for a sentence of no more than one year, served concurrently with his federal sentence. Finally, Farmer acknowledged to the Executive Branch Ethics Commission 35 of the 42 violations he had been charged with, resulting in $65,000 in fines, the most ever levied by the commission. Farmer's attorney indicated that U.S. Attorney Kerry Harvey and Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway had been pursuing additional indictments against Farmer when the plea bargain was reached. Although still restricted from leaving the state, Farmer was allowed to remain free pending sentencing. Van Tatenhove sentenced Farmer to 27 months in federal prison on January 14, 2014. He recommended that the sentence be served at the Federal Correctional Institution in Manchester, Farmer's hometown, but the Federal Bureau of Prisons opted to assign him to the United States Penitentiary, Hazelton near Bruceton Mills, West Virginia. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that Farmer's inmate number, 16226-032, was reminiscent of his college jersey number, 32. Originally scheduled to report to prison on March 18, Farmer was granted a one-week delay by Van Tatenhove to watch his son, Trey, play for Clay County High School in the KHSAA basketball tournament. Clay County lost that game to Covington Catholic High School 80–78 in the first round of the tournament. Van Tatenhove insisted that he granted the delay in deference to the Farmer family, not as a special favor for Farmer himself. On March 25, 2014, Farmer reported to the satellite camp of the Hazelton prison to begin serving his sentence. He was imprisoned for almost 20 months, transitioned to a halfway house in Lexington on December 18, 2015, and was released on January 21, 2016. In May 2016, Farmer filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. His petition stated that he was unemployed and owed $385,745 in debts – including $120,000 in restitution to the state and $15,000 in child support that are ineligible for bankruptcy forgiveness – against $24,259 in assets.

He won the FA Cup Final with Southampton in 1976 and, from July 2002 to July 2009, was manager of Salisbury City. Career Holmes was born in Southampton and educated at St. Mary's College. Southampton He was an apprentice with Southampton in the early 1970s. He made his first team debut on 2 March 1974 away to Arsenal. A natural left-sided player, he was equally at home at full-back, midfield, centre-back or sweeper. A loyal one-club man, Holmes spent 14 years at The Dell. Naturally left-sided, he could play at left-back or midfield and was a thoughtful, yet thrusting, player who was as reliable as he was skilful. He played at left-midfield in the 1976 F.A. Cup Final against Manchester United which Saints won 1–0, and also played and scored in the 1979 League Cup final against Nottingham Forest, which was lost 2–3. Between these two Wembley appearances, he was an integral member of the Southampton team that gained promotion from Division 2 at the end of the 1977–78 season. An urbane man, he became club captain in March 1980, and on his 400th appearance for the club, Lawrie McMenemy praised his \\"reliability, dependability and flexibility\\", adding that he was \\"a man for all seasons\\". Holmes was a constant when Southampton finished second in Division 1 in the 1983–84 season and was part of a midfield that was probably the best in the club's history. On 16 August 1986, Saints recognised his loyalty by awarding him a testimonial match against John Mortimore's Benfica, which was won 4–1, with Holmes scoring one of the goals. International honours eluded Holmes, although he was picked for England under-23 only for injury to prevent him playing. His last appearance for Southampton was on 14 Feb 1987 at Tottenham Hotspur. A pelvic injury forced him to retire from the game in May 1987, by which time only Terry Paine and Mick Channon had made more appearances for the Saints. In total, he played 543 times for Southampton, scoring 64 goals. After Southampton After leaving Saints he spent the 1987–88 season with East Cowes Vics, before spending a season as coach back at Southampton working with manager Chris Nicholl. In 1989, he quit football and bought a general store at Winterslow near Salisbury. In 1999, he emigrated to Florida to set up a property management company, which he sold in 2004. Salisbury City In July 2002, he was tempted back into football when he was offered the manager's job at Salisbury City. Under Holmes' management, Salisbury gained promotion to the Conference South in the 2005–06 season by finishing top of the Southern League Premier Division, followed by winning the play-off final in the 2006–07 season to participate in the Conference Premier in 2007–08. In January 2008, following the departure of George Burley, Holmes was linked with a return to Southampton as manager. Although he was not offered the job, Holmes stated that Southampton was \\"the only club I'd leave Salisbury for\\". He became Salisbury's general manager in July 2009, with Tommy Widdrington taking control of the first team. Holmes left Salisbury on 14 July 2010 by mutual consent.

Flint played in the Bluesbreakers on and off for five years, adding a distinctive aspect to their blues-based sound partly through his love of jazz. He appeared on their albums John Mayall Plays John Mayall (1965) and Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton (1966, also known as The Beano Album). Flint then left to play alongside Alexis Korner and Savoy Brown; his place in the group was taken by Aynsley Dunbar. In 1970 Flint formed McGuinness Flint with Tom McGuinness, former guitarist and bassist with Manfred Mann. They reached number 2 in the UK Singles chart with \\"When I'm Dead And Gone\\", which was followed in 1971 by another hit single, \\"Malt and Barley Blues\\", which peaked at number 5. They also released their self-titled debut album in 1970, which reached the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart in 1971. However the early success of the group proved to be short-lived. Despite featuring the production skills of Glyn Johns and the accompaniment of pianist Nicky Hopkins, their second album Happy Birthday, Ruthy Baby proved to be the end of the original line-up. Multi-instrumentalist band members Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle, who also wrote most of the songs, left the group following its release. Flint and McGuinness teamed up with Dennis Coulson and Dixie Dean to release the album Lo and Behold in 1972, which consisted solely of obscure Bob Dylan covers. Shortly after this Coulson left. Despite the release of two further albums and a Greatest Hits collection in 1973, the band split in 1975. Flint played with the Bonzo Dog Band from 1971 and appeared with them until their final album, Let's Make Up And Be Friendly. In 1977 Flint was the drummer and bodhrán player on the album Suburban Ethnia by the band Chanter. Flint's last band- based venture was The Blues Band, a supergroup whose other members were Dave Kelly, Gary Fletcher, McGuinness and another Manfred Mann veteran, singer Paul Jones. Their debut The Official Bootleg Album was released in 1980, and Flint also appeared on their follow-up albums Ready (1980) and Itchy Feet (1981) before departing. In 1995 Flint appeared in the BBC television documentary Rock Family Trees to discuss the history of the Bluesbreakers and the many offshoots of the band. By that time he was working as a porter at Mansfield College, Oxford, from where he retired in 2007. Flint also featured on records by Georgie Fame, Jack Dupree and Tom Newman amongst others.

Composed almost entirely of gold, it has a face value of five dollars. Its production was authorized by The Act of April 2, 1792, and it was the first gold coin minted by the United States. Turban Head A unique 16-star variety of the 1797 Turban Head half eagle The design and composition of the half eagle changed many times over the years, but it was originally designed by Robert Scot. At this time the coin contained .9167 gold and .0833 copper and silver. It had a diameter of approximately , a weight of 8.75 grams, and a reeded edge. The obverse design, or \\"Turban Head\\", depicted a capped portrait of Liberty facing to the right. The reverse depicted a small eagle. This type was produced from 1795 to 1798. Simultaneously, another type was minted that depicted a larger heraldic eagle on the reverse with the inscription \\"E PLURIBUS UNUM\\". This type was produced through 1807. Draped Bust From 1807 to 1812, a new type designed by John Reich was produced, the \\"Draped Bust\\" (also referred to as the \\"Capped Bust\\"), featuring a round-capped Liberty facing left on the obverse and a modified eagle on the reverse. For the first time, the value \\"5 D.\\" was placed on the reverse of the coin to indicate its value. In 1813 a modified version of the Draped Bust was introduced, removing much of the bustline (\\"Capped Head\\") and giving Liberty an overall larger appearance. This design which would last through 1834. Another modification occurred in 1829 when the diameter of the coin was reduced slightly to 23.8 mm, although the overall design remained unchanged. Classic Head 1834 Classic Head half eagle By 1834, the gold in the half eagle had been worth more than its face value for several years. The Act of June 28, 1834 called for a reduction in the gold used. The weight of the coin was reduced to 8.36 grams, the diameter reduced to 22.5 mm, and the composition changed to .8992 gold and .1008 silver and copper. A new obverse, the \\"Classic Head\\", was created by William Kneass for the altered coin. The reverse still depicted the modified eagle introduced in 1813, but \\"E PLURIBUS UNUM\\" was removed to distinguish further the new composition. In 1837, the gold content of this type was increased to .900 in accordance with the Act of January 18, 1837. Liberty Head In 1839 the coin was redesigned again. The new obverse was designed by Christian Gobrecht and is known as the \\"Liberty Head or \\"Coronet head\\". The reverse design remained largely the same, although the value was changed from \\"5 D.\\" to \\"FIVE D.\\". For those struck at the Philadelphia Mint, there was no longer any silver in the coin - its composition was now .900 gold and .100 copper. However, gold ore used at the southern branch mints of Charlotte and Dahlonega had a high natural silver content, and many of these coins contained up to five percent silver, giving them a distinct so-called \\"green gold\\" color. Its weight was virtually the same, 8.359 grams, but the diameter was reduced one final time, to 21.6 mm, in 1840, for a gold content of 0.242 Troy Oz. This design was used for nearly 70 years, from 1839 to 1908, with a modest change in 1866, when \\"IN GOD WE TRUST\\" was placed on the reverse above the eagle. The Liberty Head half eagle holds the distinction of being the only coin of a single design to be minted at seven U.S. Mints: Philadelphia, Dahlonega, Charlotte, New Orleans, San Francisco, Carson City, and Denver. Scarcer dates and coins of higher grades can be worth much more, and all Charlotte, Carson City and Dahlonega pieces are scarce and valuable. Indian Head 1908 Indian Head half eagle In 1908, the final type, designed by Bela Lyon Pratt, was first produced. The composition, weight, and diameter of the coin remained unchanged, but both the obverse and reverse were drastically altered. The new design matched the new quarter eagle design of the same date. These two series are unique in United States coinage because the design and inscriptions are stamped in incuse, rather than being raised from the surface, meaning that the flat surfaces are the highest points of the coin. The obverse depicted an Indian head wearing a feathered headdress. The reverse depicted a perched eagle with the inscriptions \\"E PLURIBUS UNUM\\" and \\"IN GOD WE TRUST\\". Production of the half eagle was suspended during World War I and not resumed until 1929, the final year of issue. Due to higher demand common date Indian Head half eagles tend to be worth slightly more than common date Liberty Head half eagles. Distinctions The $5 denomination has the distinction of being the only denomination for which coins were minted at eight US mints. Prior to 1838 all half eagles were minted in Philadelphia because there were no other operating mints. In 1838, the Charlotte Mint and the Dahlonega Mint produced half eagles of the Coronet type in their first years of operation, and would continue to mint half eagles until 1861, their last year of operation. The New Orleans Mint minted half eagles from 1840 to 1861. The San Francisco Mint first produced half eagles in 1854, its first year of operation, as did Carson City in 1870, and Denver in 1906. Although circulating half eagle production was discontinued in 1929, half eagle commemorative and $5 denominated (1/10 ounce) bullion coins were minted at West Point starting in the late twentieth century. Proof coins were produced at Philadelphia from 1859 on.

Johnny Almond, born John Albert Almond on 20 July 1946 in Enfield, Middlesex, previously played in Zoot Money's Big Roll Band and the Alan Price Set, as well as performing considerable session work in England. In 1969 he had founded Johnny Almond's Music Machine and had recorded two solo records Patent Pending and Hollywood Blues. On Patent Pending Almond is accompanied by Geoff Condon, Jimmy Crawford, Steve Hammond, Roger Sutton and Johnny Wiggins. On Hollywood Blues he jams with Curtis Amy, Hadley Caliman, Joe Harris, Charles Kynard, Ray Neapolitan, Joe Pass, Earl Palmer and Vi Redd. Almond and Mark began playing together on John Mayall's (post-Bluesbreakers) records The Turning Point (1969) and Empty Rooms (1969). From that experience they decided to form Mark-Almond. Mark-Almond Mark-Almond's first two albums, Mark- Almond (1970) and Mark-Almond II (1971) were recorded for Bob Krasnow's Blue Thumb label, and were noted for their embossed envelope-style album covers. The first album, including \\"The Ghetto,\\" received many plaudits. It also contained \\"The City,\\" which, at 10 minutes, 32 seconds, is notable for its range of styles and musical expertise. The band's second album contained the Boston regional hit song \\"One Way Sunday,\\" which garnered airplay for them in the United States on album-oriented rock stations in Boston, Massachusetts on the WBCN FM AOR radio station, and in Baltimore, MD at WAYE, according to Program Director Ty Ford. The group then recorded two albums for Columbia Records, Rising (1972) and the live album, Mark-Almond 73 (1973), by which time the group's members had grown to seven. In October 1972,Rolling Stone: \\"Random notes. A bad mishap for Jon Mark of Mark/Almond. In Hawaii on tour with Joe Cocker last Sunday, he fell out of a tree and lost the ring finger on his left Hand.\\" 26 October 1972. Mark was involved in an accident in Hawaii and lost most of his left-hand ring finger.John Halsey: Patto - the John Halsey Interview. (PDF; 306 kB) Speaking on the incident, Mark was quoted later in Melody Maker as saying he \\"climbed like a native and fell like an Englishman\\". \\"What Am I Living For\\" from Mark-Almond 73 gained the group the most U.S. radio airplay they would get, but nevertheless they disbanded later that year. Mark released a solo record for Columbia Song for a Friend in 1975. He and Almond reunited in 1975 and released To the Heart on ABC Records (which had acquired Blue Thumb) in 1976, which featured the drummer Billy Cobham. Other notable musicians, who have recorded or toured with Mark-Almond include drummer Dannie Richmond, violinist Greg Bloch, keyboardist Tommy Eyre and bassist Roger Sutton. Eyre and Sutton later teamed in Riff Raff. A&M; Records signed the duo in 1978 and released Other Peoples Rooms, but the record did not sell as well as earlier releases. Mark-Almond disbanded again in the mid 1980s, after releasing two decent albums, Tuesday in New York' (1980) and a live offering The Last & Live (1981). In 1996 Mark-Almond reunited again for a CD release, Night Music, which featured keyboardist Mike Nock and others.  Late history  Mark moved to New Zealand in the mid 1980s, and released a number of successful solo Ambient music recordings on his White Cloud record label, as well as collaborating with other artists on traditional Celtic and folk recordings and producing other artists. A release of Tibetan Monk chants Mark recorded and produced with his wife Thelma Burchell won a Grammy Award in 2004.Scott MacLeod: Long trek to Grammy win for Taupo couple. New Zealand Herald. Almond lived in the San Francisco Bay Area. He died on 18 November 2009 from cancer, aged 63. He occasionally surprised local bar owners, arriving with his sax to jam, some of which was recorded, including a rousing rendition of \\"Stormy Monday\\". On 25 June 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Mark-Almond among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

He is Professor of Philosophy at the Residential College of the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S. He is co-author of The Animal Rights Debate (Rowman and Littlefield, 2001), a point-counterpoint volume with Tom Regan; he is also the author of Democracy (Macmillan, 1972); the author of Four Systems (Random House, 1982); the editor of Communism, Fascism, and Democracy (McGraw Hill, 1997); the co-author (with J. Sterba) of Affirmative Action and Racial Preference (Oxford, 2003), co-author (with I. M. Copi) of Introduction to Logic, 13th edition (Prentice-Hall, 2008), and author of A Conflict of Principles: The Battle over Affirmative Action at the University of Michigan (University Press of Kansas, 2014). He has published many essays in moral and political philosophy in philosophical, medical, and legal journals. He has served as a member of the Medical School faculty of the University of Michigan, and as Chairman of the University of Michigan faculty, where he has been an active member of the philosophy faculty since 1955. In 2006 the University held a celebration honoring his 50 years on the faculty.  Historical influence and political influence University of Michigan Residential College During the years 1964-67 Cohen, then an Associate Prof. of Philosophy, was an active member of the small planning committee for the Residential College of the University of Michigan. He became the principal author of the \\"Blue Book\\" which laid the intellectual foundations for the Residential College. When the Residential College opened in 1967 Cohen became a full-time member of its faculty, and his appointment was shifted from the Department of Philosophy to the Residential College, where he remains the only one of that founding group serving as an active member of the Michigan faculty. In 1998 anonymous donations totaling some $13,000 were made to the university to name a reading room in the Residential College in Cohen's honor. This was done; a plaque honoring him was placed. It was removed shortly afterwards, however, the reason given being \\"procedural violations.\\" Many in the University believed that Cohen was being discriminated against because of his outspoken and unpopular opposition to the race-conscious admissions system of the University. Senior members of the Law School faculty, and other faculties, who did not agree with Cohen's views on the admissions matter, nevertheless wrote angrily to the President, Lee Bollinger, in the conviction that technical violations of procedure were being arbitrarily invoked against him, and that the reputation of the University had been besmirched. The President agreed to replace the plaque and to reaffirm the name of the Reading Room; Cohen agreed that his own donation of $10,000 to the University for the room be made public. Racial preference issues In 1996, Cohen made public information he had gathered using the State of Michigan's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) about the substantial weight of racial factors in the University of Michigan undergraduate admissions office use of a \\"grid system\\". Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher sued the University based on this data. Barbara Grutter, in a separate proceeding, sued the Law School of the University of Michigan relying on additional data also revealed by Cohen's FOIA inquiry. While the U-M changed its \\"grid system\\" to a \\"point system\\" the following year, it argued that both mechanical systems were identical in outcome and that the point system, which became more famous, was designed merely to be easier to understand. The system that Cohen made public was ruled unconstitutional by the U. S. Supreme Court [in Gratz v. Bollinger, 2003] as a \\"mechanical system,\\" although in a separate ruling concerning the U-M Law School [Grutter v. Bollinger, 2003], the limited use of non-mechanical preferences was allowed. Following the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings on June 23, 2003, Cohen, Gratz, Grutter, and others were among those who invited Ward Connerly to Michigan, where he appeared in a July 8, 2003, speech on the Michigan campus announcing the formation of the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative (MCRI), to forbid preference by race or nationality in the state. This became Proposition 2 (06-2) in Michigan, appearing on the November 8, 2006, ballot. Cohen was a leading spokesperson for Proposition 2 in a heated electoral campaign. Proposition 2 passed by a 58%–42% margin. As a result of Cohen's involvement in the issue, he has appeared on numerous panels and in media reports on racial preferences since the mid-1990s. Civil liberties activism Cohen has been a lifetime activist for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), serving as Chair of the Michigan affiliate of the ACLU, and for years as a member of the National Board of Directors of the ACLU. When the American Nazi Party threatened, in 1978, to march in Skokie, Illinois, Cohen published (in The Nation to which he was a regular contributor) several widely reprinted essays defending the right to present publicly even the most abhorrent political views. [See: \\"The Extreme Test of Free Speech,\\" The Nation, 15 April 1978.] When (as a part of the protest against the Vietnam War) efforts were made to forbid research of certain kinds on the U-M campus, Cohen strongly supported the freedom of faculty members to engage in the inquiries that they thought appropriate. During that war Cohen, in active protest, defended selective conscientious objection [see: \\"The Case for Selective Pacifism,\\" The Nation, 8 July 1968], and defended some, but not all, civil disobedience. [See: \\"Civil Disobedience and the Law,\\" Rutgers Law Review, Fall, 1966.] When University administrators sought to censor the showing of sexually explicit films on campus, Cohen, then serving as Chair of the University faculty, strongly defended student freedoms before the Regents of the University, with ultimate success. In the mid-1970s, when the fear of misuse led some to oppose the continuation of research in recombinant DNA technology, Cohen defended such research vigorously, both on the Michigan campus and also in The New England Journal of Medicine [\\"When May Research Be Stopped?\\" NEJM 26 May 1977]. Cohen maintains his membership in the ACLU despite his disagreement with the organization's support of race preferences in university admissions.Open letter from Cohen to Michigan ACLU President Kary Moss . Research ethics From 1985 to 1995 a fraction of Cohen's appointment was in the Medical School of the University of Michigan, where he served as Professor of Philosophy and as Director of the Program in Human Values in Medicine. There he served also as a founding member of the Michigan Medical Center's Ethics Committee, as a member of its Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and for more than 30 years, as a member of its Institutional Review Board (IRB). Cohen's involvement with research on humans led to reflections on the uses of animals in science, which he defends [see: \\"The Case for the Use of Animals in Biomedical Research,\\" New England Journal of Medicine, 2 October 1986]; and on the limited uses of prisoners as research subjects, which he also defends [see: \\"Medical Experimentation on Prisoners,\\" Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, Spring, 1978]; on ethical issues in transplant medicine [see: \\"Alcoholics and Liver Transplantation,\\" Journal of the American Medical Association, 13 March 1991]; and on abortion [see: \\"How Not to Argue about Abortion,\\" The Michigan Quarterly Review, Fall, 1990]. Labor arbitration activities Having written much about the concept of justice, Cohen became involved, during the 1970s, in the process of Labor/Management arbitration. With the support of the late William Haber (Economics, U-M), a well-known arbitrator, Cohen became a member of the Labor Panel of the American Arbitration Association, and over the years has issued many arbitration awards in many industries. Cohen remains an active arbitrator for the AAA, and also an Act 312 Arbitrator, and Grievance Arbitrator, for the State of Michigan.

Ramachandran, is an Indian painter, born in 1935 in Attingal, Kerala. In 2005, he was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian honour, for outstanding service to the nation.The artist's website and in 2002, he was elected a Fellow of the Lalit Kala Akademi. Career In 1957, he obtained his master's degree in Malayalam literature, but art had remained a continuing interest since childhood. He joined Kala Bhavan, Santiniketan and completed his education in art in 1961 studying under masters like Ramkinkar Baij, and Benode Behari Mukherjee. Between 1961 and 1964, he did his doctoral thesis on Kerala mural painting. By the mid-60s, he had moved to Delhi and in 1965 he joined Jamia Millia Islamia as a lecturer in art education. Later, he became a professor in the same department and was attached to the university until his voluntary retirement in 1992. In 1991, he was appointed honorary chairman of Kerala Lalithakala Akademi, and in 2005 became Professor Emeritus at Jamia Millia Islamia University. Ramachandran lives and works in New Delhi. He is married to artist Tan Yuan Chameli, daughter of Tan Yun-Shan. Work Initially, Ramachandran painted in an expressionist style which poignantly reflected the angst of urban life. The paintings were large, akin to murals, and comprised powerful figuration. By the 1980s however, Ramachandran's work underwent a sea-change. Urban reality was no longer a preoccupation. A tribal community in Rajasthan with its vibrant ethos gripped his imagination. Simultaneously, the colours and forms of the murals in the Kerala temples began to influence his mode of expression. Myths became a great resource for him. The first in this new style was ‘Yayati’, a retelling of this story from the Indian epic Mahabharata. It was conceived as the inner shrine of a Kerala temple, with thirteen bronze sculptures surrounded on three sides by painted murals, 60 by 8 feet in total size. As a painter, his strong command over lines, colours and forms create an exciting visual drama. Ramachandran's canvases are vibrant with a sense of teeming, burgeoning life. The artist's quirky sense of irony imbues his paintings with a piquancy and feeling of new discoveries. And, as one who considered Ramkinkar Baij as his guru, Ramachandran has created sculptures which are even more intriguing in formal terms than his paintings. He designed the granite bas-relief sculpture at the Rajiv Gandhi Memorial at Sriperumbudur, near Chennai, Tamil Nadu, completed in 2003. It extends for 125 feet and has a height of nearly 20 feet. Publications In 2003, the National Gallery of Modern Art (New Delhi) organized a major retrospective of his work. A comprehensive two-volume book ‘A Ramachandran: A Retrospective’ (by Prof. Siva Kumar) documenting and analyzing his works was released simultaneously. Ramachandran is the author of an extensive study on Kerala temple murals (‘Abode of Gods: Mural Traditions of Kerala’). He has also written many articles in English which have been translated into many languages including Japanese and his mother tongue Malayalam. A collection of his articles in Malayalam, Aannottam (Male Gaze), translated by P Sudhakaran, was recently published by Kairali Books, Kannur, Kerala. Ramachandran has also published a couple of books in Malayalam. Ramachandran has also written and illustrated numerous picture books for children published in India, Japan, Britain and the United States, for which he received the Noma Concours Awards of 1978 and 1980. Some of the original illustrations from these books are on permanent display at the Museum of Children's Books at Miyazaki, Japan. Selected books and documentaries on A.

T/Maker was originally distributed by Lifeboat Associates of New York. T/Maker took a different approach to most other spreadsheets: instead of embedding formulas in each cell, formulas were defined on a per-row and per-column basis in the margins. Although T/Maker was released six months after VisiCalc, it was perhaps the first application to provide an 'office' suite approach to data. Tables could be used in databases or spreadsheets and were accessible in 'word' type documents. T/Maker company The T/Maker Company was an early personal computer software company, formed in 1983 in order to market CP/M and MS-DOS programs that had originally been published by 3rd party publishing houses. They expanded into the Apple Macintosh market, releasing the ClickArt line of clip art. Other products included WriteNow on the Mac and NeXT platforms. In 1983 T/Maker Company was incorporated in Mountain View, California by Heidi Roizen – Peter's sister and a then-recent Stanford University Graduate School of Business graduate – who became its CEO. T/Maker Company went on to publish its own line of integrated applications, and also products by others intended for DOS and Windows computers as well as the Apple Macintosh, including ClickArt, the fifth software title available for the Mac. Other notable T/Maker products include Personal Publisher, a consumer-oriented desktop publishing application for the PC (acquired by Software Publishing Corporation in 1986), SmartBundle, an \\"office\\" styled bundle of major applications, Vroombooks, a multimedia storybook, and the Macintosh word processor WriteNow, (which it licensed from NeXT in 1985 and ultimately sold to WordStar in 1992). Heidi and business partner/chairman Royal Farros purchased T/Maker from Peter in 1986 and continued bootstrapping until 1989, when it became venture capital firm Hummer Winblad Venture Partners’ first venture investment. Ann Winblad became a director of the company at that time. Tim Draper of Draper Fisher led the company’s second round in 1993 and also joined the board.

In 1972, as incoming president of the Southeastern Psychological Association he appointed the organization's Task Force on the Status of Women, chaired by Ellen Kimmel. Spielberger was founding Editor (1973–76) of the American Journal of Community Psychology, official journal of Division 27 (Community Psychology) of the American Psychological Association. He was President of that Division in 1974-75. He won the Division's 1982 Award for Distinguished Contributions to Theory and Research in Community Psychology. He was president of the APA in 1991. Spielberger was formerly Chairman of the Psychology Department at the University of South Florida in Tampa, Florida and in 2012 belonged to a think tank there. In 1987 Spielberger was one of the key psychologists who supported the efforts of David Pilon and Scott Mesh in their efforts to form a national graduate student association. Spielberger was very supportive and helpful in this effort along with Raymond D. Fowler, then APA President, Virginia Staudt Sexton (St. John's University), Ellin Bloch (Division of Psychotherapy), and Pierre Ritchie (Canadian Psychological Association). In 1988 those efforts were successful and the American Psychological Association of Graduate Students was formed and in thriving 25 years later with over 30,000 members. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Spielberger, like Raymond Cattell and others before him, made the conceptual distinction between chronic or trait anxiety (a general propensity to be anxious) and temporary or state anxiety (a temporary state varying in intensity). To measure these concepts, he developed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Additional work on anxiety His work on the measurement of anxiety has been famously cited by Rollo May.The Meaning of Anxiety, Rollo May, 1977, W.W. Norton, p. xvii, xx, 11, 53, 54, 80, 111, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 403, 405, 406, 407, 408, 411, 412, and 424. He also co-wrote the book Anxiety in Sports: An International Perspective Dieter Hackfort, Charles D. Spielberger, Published by Taylor & Francis, 1990 , , 275 pages One of his earlier books, co-authored with Eric Gaudry at the University of Melbourne, examined anxiety in relation to educational achievement.Gaudry, E. & Spielberger, C. D. 1971). Anxiety and Educational Achievement. Sydney: Wiley. State Trait Anger Scale Carrying this concept further, Spielberger distinguished between state and trait anger. State anger is defined as a temporary emotional state while trait anger is a general tendency to react angrily to perceive situations. (Spielberger et al., 1983). Spielberger became a well-known authority on anger and its manifestations. Early career One of his first vocations was as an electronics technician in the U.S. Army (1945–1946). His post secondary education includes a B.S. in chemistry from the Georgia Institute of Technology (1949) and a B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of Iowa.

Overview Financial obstacles had badly hindered Queen's Park's attempts to compete for the FA Cup in the previous two seasons, with only one match actually being played. As a result, although retaining membership of the Football Association, Queen's elected not to enter for the cup on this occasion (neither would they compete in the next two seasons). Instead, there was now a domestic equivalent to compete for, the Scottish Football Association (founded in March of the previous season) having instituted its own challenge cup competition modelled on the English tournament - the Scottish Cup. As well as the international fixture with England, which returned to Partick in March, cross-border rivalry was also fuelled with the introduction of what became a prestige representative fixture of the late 19th century, an inter-city match between Glasgow and Sheffield. Scottish Cup Sixteen clubs entered the draw for the first round of the first ever Scottish Cup tournament, which was organised on the same unseeded, straight knockout basis as the FA Cup.

The Soundbug is attached to a smooth resonant surface, this surface then acts as speaker. The tone differs depending on the surface (wood, metal, glass etc.). The Soundbug was developed by FeONIC Technology (formerly Newlands Scientific), a commercial research and development company specialising in magnetostrictive audio products as a spin-off from Hull University. FeONIC used the same technology for Whispering Windows, which is able to resonate shop windows. Soundbug transmits the audio signal to the flat surface by way of a small piece of Terfenol-D, which is a magnetostrictive alloy of rare earth metals and iron. This material, when stimulated with an electrical input, causes the Terfenol to expand slightly, resulting in sound output with a very small amplitude. Once attached to a flat surface, Soundbug will translate electric signals into mechanical energy, causing the flat surface to vibrate and broadcast the sound.

Directed by Robby Henson and written by Alan B. McElroy, it stars Marc Blucas, Justine Waddell, Max Ryan, and Bill Moseley. It was shot on location in Łódź and Warsaw, Poland. The film grossed $1.4 million and has a 5% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, which called it a \\"thrill-free thriller\\" in its critical consensus. Plot Jennifer Peters (Justine Waddell) attempts to save her brother Roy, who has been abducted by a serial killer known as the Riddle Killer--or R.K.-- due to his use of riddles in the murders he commits. Jennifer has recently written a book about the nature of serial killers, to which R.K. has taken offense. Jennifer follows R.K.'s clues and finds Roy, but fails to save him as the car in which he is trapped explodes. Kevin Parson (Marc Blucas) is a seminary theology student who has recently completed the third draft of his thesis about the nature of good and evil. One day he receives a phone call from R.K. (Bill Moseley), ordering him to confess some unspecified sin or his car will explode. He also asks Kevin a riddle: \\"What falls but never breaks? What breaks but never falls?\\" Puzzled about the sin and the riddle, Kevin quickly escapes from the car before it explodes. He informs the police, among them Jennifer, but leaves out the part about the sin, believing it's something he did some time ago. He receives a threat against his childhood dog and goes to the house of his Aunt Balinda (Priscilla Barnes), but fails to save his dog from a bomb. Back home again, he meets his friend since childhood, Samantha Sheer (Laura Jordan) and they decide to try to figure out the mystery of the Riddle Killer who continues to target him and seems to be able to monitor Kevin in his own home. Sam solves the first riddle; the answer is night and day. She is working as an insurance detective and takes to her laboratory the book in which the killer had hidden a mobile phone. Another threat comes from the Riddle Killer: A bomb is attached to Kevin's fellow student Henry and a message on Henry's forehead points to , a Bible text about death as the wages of sin. The police manage to get the bomb off Henry's body. Kevin now remembers a boy who had always watched him and Sam during their childhood. In self-defense, Kevin had locked him in a warehouse and left him to die. He thinks that the boy escaped, and is now R.K. Later, Kevin finds the papers of his thesis scattered around his room. He finds a TV in his refrigerator which shows R.K. with another riddle: what takes you away but doesn't go anywhere? Kevin confesses leaving the boy in the warehouse and apologizes, hoping to satisfy him so he'll leave him alone. But R.K. does not relent. Kevin and Sam, whose father was a police officer, find out that a bus on 3rd Avenue is in danger and manage to get all the passengers off safely before a bomb explodes. Jennifer visits Kevin's Aunt Balinda and finds that she has been keeping her husband and son Bobby in the dark about the entire world outside their home, and had done the same to Kevin. She also finds a bloody jacket in the warehouse. Meanwhile, Sam talks with Kevin in a hotel. R.K. sends a recorded message to the hotel room which points to an empty building and the number 33369--the warehouse. Before Jennifer gets to the hotel, Kevin and Sam are at the warehouse, where Sam sees a wall full of enigmatic words and is trapped by the killer. When Kevin enters the building, he finds a bomb. He is unable to stop it but can escape with Sam. Jennifer and the police arrive and investigate. Sam leaves and Kevin insists on not cooperating with Jennifer, as the killer insisted on no police involvement or he'd kill more people. Jennifer declares her resignation, saying that as she is no longer officially involved, she no longer counts. However, Kevin ignores her. Kevin finds another threat about a house on fire at midnight and realizes that Aunt Balinda is in danger. As he rushes to try to save her, he remembers that she abused him when he was a child. Sam finds a note from R.K. and is startled to realize that he has the same handwriting as Kevin. She calls Jennifer, who tells her that there was only one pair of footprints in the warehouse. Sam is now sure that she never actually saw R.K. The women also realize that all the riddles were about opposites, like nightfall and daybreak, and conclude that R.K. might actually be Kevin's \\"evil half.\\" Kevin finds Balinda tied up, and the Riddle Killer introduces himself as Slater (Bill Moseley).In the book, Slater's identity is given at the beginning. Sam rushes to Balinda's house and finds that the Riddle Killer, Slater, is real after all when she looks under the door and sees two pairs of shoes. Slater explains that he will have Kevin kill Balinda, then leave him to take the blame, as everyone will believe Kevin is the Riddle Killer. Jennifer arrives to find Kevin pointing a gun at himself. It turns out that both Slater and Sam are figments of Kevin's imagination; traumatized by Aunt Balinda's abuse, Kevin had imagined his friend Samantha and the boy with whom he had fought, and had subconsciously imitated the real Riddle Killer. Jennifer convinces Kevin of this, and his visions of Slater and Sam vanish.In the book, Sam herself convinces Kevin to open his eyes and see the creator. Kevin is devastated that his best friend is gone, but the professor assures him that Samantha will always be with him; she is him. Kevin had said that the real Riddle Killer was right in front of their eyes, and Jennifer discovers while examining his wall of clippings that the hot dog vendor who had supposedly been given a book by the killer to give to her is at the front of the crowd in a photo, holding a camera. When captured, he confesses that he hates copycats and had meant to kill Kevin for copying him. Kevin is sent to an institution and Jennifer visits him there. Cast {  ! Actor !!

Choke released Needless To Say the following year, an album that was chosen by Exclaim! magazine as one of the top ten punk albums of the year.http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/Metal/choke-foreword 1999 saw the release of Foreword. A departure from the skate-punk sound that defined \\"Needless to Say\\", \\"Foreword\\" was described jokingly by Shea as the \\"career killer\\". Despite this, Exclaim! magazine called the album \\"a tremendous accomplishment by punk standards\\".http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/Metal/choke-foreword Foreword cemented the band's reputation as one of Canada's top punk acts, alongside Propagandhi, Painted Thin, and I Spy. In 2002, There's A Story To This Moral was released, followed by 2005's Slow Fade Or How I Learned To Question Infinity. The latter was recorded in Vancouver, with Blair Calibaba (Gob, Propagandhi) and Paul Forgues (Slayer, Nine Inch Nails, Treble Charger), and became the fifth release through Smallman Records. The band was heralded by Exclaim! as \\"...one of the finest technically progressive bands on the planet.\\" Breakup In 2007 the band decided to split up after one more tour that would end in Edmonton on June 9.

She is believed to have first been married to Alexander Gordon circa 1493. They may have had a daughter.

After James IV's marriage by proxy, he met Janet at Bothwell Castle in April 1503, then she was sent to Darnaway Castle in August just before Margaret arrived.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 2 (1900), xxxiii, 297 It is not clear whether she is the same as the \\"Janet bair ars\\" who received gifts from the king in 1505–12.McDougall p 286 She also had relationships with two other men, one of whom was John Ramsay, 1st Lord Bothwell whom she married in 1505. Two of her partners died at the Battle of Flodden.

It is located at the gateway of the Singalila National Park, 28 km away from Darjeeling town. The income of the local residents is geared towards tourism, especially foreign trekkers. Maney Bhanjyang is the start of the trailhead for the trek to Sandakphu on the Singalila Ridge, the highest point in West Bengal. Conveyance for Sandakphu is also available mainly from Maney Bhanjyang in the form of Land Rovers of 1960 model. The 4-hour ride can be quite 'jumpy' as drivers maneuver their prized possessions along snaky curves and uphill roads. Mane Bhanjang lies on the border between India and Nepal. The two countries are separated by a small culvert, which also acts as a motor stand for vehicles ferrying people to Sukhiapokhri and Darjeeling. This small valley is a residence of approximately 500 households with an approximate population of 6000. Being situated within the ranges of the Singalila National Park, expansion of this 'forest village' is strictly restricted beyond its current borders so as to protect the surrounding forest and its ecosystem. The village has a renovated playground where a football tournament is organised in a very lustrous way every year during the Independence Day of India and from last 2 years, Mini Gold Cup has been organised by MBFA (Maney Bhanjyang Football Associated) which has grown up to be a huge success lately. Moreover, Land Rover Taxi Association of Maney Bhanjyang is the largest operator of Land Rover Taxis in the entire South East Asia. While there are some people who claims that, this is also the biggest Land Rover Taxi operator association. Keeping aside the debate and controversy; one thing is for sure that, these fleet of ageing Land Rover Series I vehicles are the \\"lifeline of an entirely remote area\\", where there is no tar topped roads, but only some rocks laid to be called as the 'Road'. The association is known as the Singalila Land Rover Association, and it operates a total number of 45 Land Rover Series I vehicles. Although these SUV's are more than half a century old, but all of them still looks and performs as good as new. From the exterior, the iconic Land Rover Green badges are gone or completely faded away; instead there are aluminium plates with the iconic Land Rover symbols and the name itself. Surely those badges took the toll of travelling on the rough roads and cloud wrapped gushy wind. Geography Maney Bhanjyang is located at an average elevation of 1928m in the Darjeeling Himalayan Hill Region in the Singalila Ridge, the highest point in West Bengal. These hills are a part of the Mahabharata Range or Lesser Himalayas. The soil is chiefly composed of sandstone and conglomerate formations, which are the solidified and upheaved detritus of the greater range of Himalaya. However, the soil is often poorly consolidated (the permeable sediments of the region do not retain water between rains) and is not considered suitable for agriculture. The area has steep slopes and loose topsoil, leading to frequent landslides during the monsoons. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the area in which the village lies falls under seismic zone-IV (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing proneness to earthquakes) near the convergent boundary of the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates and is subject to frequent earthquakes. The geographical co-ordinates of the village are . Maney Bhanjyang is surrounded by several small villages and hamlets within a radius of 5–8 km. Being a border of Nepal and India, the Friday Market or the \\"haat\\" brings the entire population of the area together for various household and business purposes. Area overview The map alongside shows the northern portion of the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region. Kangchenjunga, which rises with an elevation of is located further north of the area shown.Sandakphu, rising to a height of , on the Singalila Ridge, is the highest point in West Bengal.In Darjeeling Sadar subdivision 61% of the total population lives in the rural areas and 39% of the population lives in the urban areas.There are 78 tea gardens/ estates (the figure varies slightly according to different sources), producing and largely exporting Darjeeling tea in the district. It engages a large proportion of the population directly/ indirectly.Some tea gardens were identified in the 2011 census as census towns or villages. Such places are marked in the map as CT (census town) or R (rural/ urban centre). Specific tea estate pages are marked TE. Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivision. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. Transport Maney Bhanjyang can be reached directly from New Jalpaiguri railway station where hired vehicles are available, although the number of vehicles are limited. Most vehicles are available from 4 am to 6 am. From Siliguri, shared and non-shared taxis operate directly for Mane Bhanjyang. One can also avail taxis from Siliguri and Darjeeling, which travel via Maney Bhanjyang. While travelling from Siliguri, it is convenient to take taxis from Siliguri to Sukhia Pokhri which is about 2 & 1/2 hours ride, then more half an hour taxi ride from Sukhia Pokhri to Maney Bhanjyang. Another option is to take a vehicle en route to Darjeeling and drop down at Ghoom. Conveyance is available from Ghoom to Sukhiapokhri and then from Sukhiapokhri to Maney Bhanjyang. Maney Bhanjyang is the base camp for trekkers heading toward Sandakphu and Phalut. All required accessories and stuffs required for the 2–4-day trek is available here. The famous Rhododendron trek and the Himalayan Run & Trek are organised from here. Education Maney Bhanjyang has three schools in total. Maney Bhanjyang High School has classes from Grade V to Grade X and is upgrade to higher secondary school up to Grade XII. The course curriculum followed is that of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education. Other schools are Rhododendron Integratus Boarding School and R.C.

Goals The goals stated in the Summary of Goals 2000 include: ;By the Year 2000... * All children in America will start school ready to learn. * The high school graduation rate will increase to at least 90 percent. * All students will leave grades 4, 8, and 12 having demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter including English, mathematics, science, foreign languages, civics and government, economics, the arts, history, and geography, and every school in America will ensure that all students learn to use their minds well, so they may be prepared for responsible citizenship, further learning, and productive employment in our nation's modern economy. * United States students will be first in the world in mathematics and science achievement. * Every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. * Every school in the United States will be free of drugs, violence, and the unauthorized presence of firearms and alcohol and will offer a disciplined environment conducive to learning. * The nation's teaching force will have access to programs for the continued improvement of their professional skills and the opportunity to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to instruct and prepare all American students for the next century. * Every school will promote partnerships that will increase parental involvement and participation in promoting the social, emotional, and academic growth of children. History \\"The Goals 2000: Educate America Act (P.L. 103-227)\\" was signed into law on March 31, 1994 by President Bill Clinton. The Act provides resources to states and communities to ensure that all students reach their full potential. It is based on the premise of outcomes-based education that students will reach higher levels of achievement when more is expected of them. Congress appropriated $105 million for fiscal year 1994. States submitted applications to develop school improvement plans, and make subgrants to local schools, and awards for pre-service and professional development. In 1996, President Clinton introduced a competitive grant entitled the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund (TLCF). The president allocated 2 million dollars to ensure that every child in every school utilize technology to achieve high standards by the dawn of the 21st century. The president urged a variety of stakeholders from the private sector, schools, teachers, students, community groups, state and local governors and the federal government to work in a partnership toward achieving high levels of technology in schools. In a 1996 letter to school Chief Operating Officers, President Clinton urged states and local school districts to work together in achieving the following four goals: # All teachers will have the training and support they need to help all students learn through computers the information superhighway # All teachers and students will have modern computers in their classrooms # Every classroom will be connected to the information superhighway # Effective and engaging software and on-line resources will be an integral part of every school curriculum The overarching problem behind ensuring that every child in every school utilize an equal level of technology is the TLCF was a competitive grant. The issue with the competitive grant notion is that not all schools and therefore children could receive equal levels of technological assistance. National Standards for Arts Education With the passage of Goals 2000, the first National Standards for Arts Education were created. There are content standards for dance, theater, music, and the visual arts. Every content standard is followed by several achievement standards describing how students are to demonstrate mastery of the content standards. The goals are not intended to be a curriculum. Instead, curriculum is to be developed locally on the basis of the goals. Standards are grouped in four divisions—creation and performance; cultural and historical context; perception and analysis; and the nature and value of the arts. The Music Content Standards for each level are as follows: # Singing, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music # Playing instruments, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music # Improvising melodies, variations, and accompaniments # Composing and arranging music within specified guidelines # Reading and notating music # Listening to, analyzing, and describing music # Evaluating music and music performance # Understanding relationships between music, the other arts, and disciplines outside the arts # Understanding music in relation to history and culture  End of Goals 2000  With the final language of President George Bush's 2001 No Child Left Behind Act (H.R. 1) came the withdrawal of all authorization for Goals 2000. However, even though Congress had withdrawn its authorization for Goals 2000, if funding was not also withdrawn, the crippled, but alive Goals 2000 program would stagger on. Then, just before leaving town on December 21, 2001, Congress passed the Fiscal Year 2002 Education Appropriations Conference Committee report which eliminated spending on Goals 2000. Goals 2000 was no longer authorized or funded. Additionally, in an article by Kenneth J. Cooper from The Washington Post dated December 3, 1999, he stated the following: :\\"The nation has not met any of the eight educational goals for the year 2000 set a decade ago by President Bush and the governors of all 50 states, although measurable progress has been made toward the goals pertaining to preschoolers and student achievement in math and reading, a national panel announced yesterday. :The National Education Goals Panel’s final report before the 2000 deadline showed that more children were 'ready to learn'—healthier and better prepared through preschool or parental reading—when they entered kindergarten. Students also demonstrated higher math proficiency, particularly in elementary and middle school, and a slight improvement in reading proficiency in middle school.\\"“’89 Education Summit's Goals Still Unmet.” The Washington Post. (December 3, 1999, Friday, Final Edition). In the case of two goals, teacher quality and school safety, the panel reported the nation has actually gone backward. The percentage of teachers holding a college degree in the main subject they teach dropped from 66 percent to 63 percent, and there was a significant increase in student use of illicit drugs, from 24 percent to 37 percent in 10th grade.

Raedykes Roman Camp is located near Stonehaven, one of a string of Roman forts and marching camps in the northernmost area (Caledonia) of Roman conquest and presence in Britannia Raedykes is the site of a Roman marching camp located just over 3 miles (5 km) NW of Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. National Grid Reference NO 842902.Landranger 45, United Kingdom Ordnance Survey Map, Stonehaven and Banchory, 1:50,000 scale (2004); Explorer 396, Stonehaven, Inverbervie and Laurencekirk, 1:25,000. It is designated as a scheduled monument. A marching camp was a temporary camp used mainly for overnight stops on a long route between more permanent forts, or as a temporary base while on campaign in hostile territory. The site Raedykes probably dates from the late 1st century AD (Agricolan), though it has been argued that it could be Antonine (2nd century) or Severan (early 3rd century).J K S St Joseph 1958 The camp rampart (vallum) encloses the summit and eastern slopes of Garrison Hill (191m 628 ft), a prominent spur overlooking the valley of the Cowie Water, a small river draining into the North Sea on the outskirts of Stonehaven. The camp covered an area of about 93 acres (37 ha), and a computer model suggests that this would have been sufficient to house three full legions, or around 16,000 troopsRoger J.A.Wilson \\"A Guide to the Roman Remains in Britain\\" 2002 Constable, London p600 The entire perimeter of Raedykes camp has been recorded, and is very irregular in shape, because of the terrain. There were six gateways of which five are visible, all protected by titulus outworks; two in the longest E side, one in the shortest S side, another in the N side and one more in the very-irregular SW side. The Mid Raedykes Farm lies inside the NW corner of the camp and Broomhill Farm lies just inside the E rampart beside the southernmost E gateway. Raedykes is situated a day's march north from Stracathro fort (initially also a marching camp) and a few hours' march south of Normandykes. History The Roman army established a chain of forts and camps during the late 1st century AD at Ardoch, Strageath, Inchtuthil, Battledykes, Stracathro, Raedykes (probably), Normandykes, Glenmailen, Bellie, Balnageith and Cawdor. Many of these forts and camps were reoccupied during the reign of emperor Septimius Severus about a century later. In the summer of 84 Agricola defeated the massed armies of the Caledonians, possibly led by Calgacus, at the battle of Mons Graupius. The area around Raedykes including nearby Kempstone Hill has been advanced by Gabriel Jacques Surenne and other scholars as the likely location for the battle in AD 83 or 84. The prominent hill called Bennachie, much further north, overlooking Inverurie near the Roman camp at Durno, is another potential site. However, there is no general agreement about the site of the battle, and no direct evidence to pinpoint it.

Lanfranconi made his major league debut in relief against the Philadelphia Phillies at Wrigley Field (September 12, 1941). Twelve days later he started and lost 2–0 to All-Star Bucky Walters and the Cincinnati Reds. Then, as a 30-year-old in 1947, he went 4–4 with one save as a starter and reliever for the Braves. In one of his best games, he defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 7–1 in the nightcap of a 4th of July double-header at Shibe Park with 28,580 fans in attendance. Lanfranconi's career totals include a record of 4–5 in 38 games, 70 innings pitched, 19 strikeouts, and an ERA of 2.96.

Etymology The word is according to the Oxford English Dictionary apparently a diminutive of dot. Production Dottle can be produced by different factors. The primary cause of an excessive amount of dottle is a tightly packed or otherwise improperly packed pipe, where the tobacco has been improperly prepared or is compressed and will not burn properly. A second possible cause can be the excessive moisture content of the tobacco and the tobacco being smoked too quickly. This can result in tobacco that is too wet to burn. Rapid or hard draws on the pipe can and will produce an excessively hot ember in the bowl causing the moisture content of the tobacco to vaporize and then condense in bottom of the bowl and in the draft hole, preventing the tobacco from burning properly. A third contributor to the creation of dottle is propylene glycol or \\"PG\\". This innocuous preservative used primarily in aromatic tobaccos can keep the moisture content high in pipe tobaccos even after drying. Smoking the pipe too fast can also produce a foul tasting liquid that collects at the bottom of the bowl and in the draft hole resulting in \\"pipe gurgle\\"; this can be inadvertently tasted. Pushing a pipe cleaner down the stem can remedy this problem to a point. Another possible cause of pipe gurgle can be a \\"wet smoker\\"; that is, a pipe smoker that pushes some saliva down the stem and into the bowl. Excessive saliva can be a factor but is rarely the cause of a \\"wet smoke\\" or pipe gurgle. An illustration by Sidney Paget for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's story The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle which appeared in The Strand Magazine in January 1892. It shows Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson examining a felt hat. Holmes's pipe rack is on the wall next to him. Dottles are generally considered troublesome because they lessen the time one may spend doing a bowl. Dottles can also give a sour taste to the smoke as it is approached by the hot ember. If dottle is not promptly removed after smoking using a pipe tool, the pipe may eventually give a foul taste to any tobacco smoked in it. When this happens, pipe sweetening is required. Some pipes are designed to specifically lessen or prevent the formation of dottle and excessive moisture. The most common are the calabash pipe, the \\"Dry System\\" pipes made by Peterson, and aluminum-stemmed pipes from Falcon and Kirsten. In the Sherlock Holmes stories, Holmes had a habit of drying out all the dottles from the day's pipes on a corner of his mantelpiece to be smoked the following morning.

The term usually applies to a fried turnover rather than an oven-baked pastry (i.e. a calzone), though calzoni and panzerotti are often mistaken for each other.Sarkar, Suhashini (June 29, 2015). \\"Panzerotti: The Empanada’s Italian Cousin\\", Saveur.

Etymology The noun panzerotto comes from a diminutive of panza, a regional variation of Italian pancia (\\"belly, tummy\\"), referring to the distinctive swelling of the pastry which resembles a belly bloating. Albeit etymologically related, the word () refers to a totally different dish from panzerotti, denoting a kind of ravioli which is typical of Genoa. Panzerotti are also popular in the United States and Canada as well, where it is often called panzerotti or panzarotti as a singular noun (plural panzerotties/panzarotties or panzarottis/panzarottis). Italy Panzerotti originated in Central and Southern Italy, especially in the Apulian cuisine. They are basically small versions of calzoni but are usually fried rather than oven-baked, that is why they are also known as calzoni fritti (\\"fried calzones\\") or pizze fritte (\\"fried pizzas\\") in Italy, most typically in Campania. In parts of Apulia, such as Molfetta and Mola di Bari (both in the Metropolitan City of Bari),\\"Panzerotti\\", Culinaria Italia.

The most common fillings for this turnover are tomato and mozzarella. Peeled whole tomatoes are drained and dried to be used as a filling as using non dried tomatoes will cause the dough to rip due to the moisture. Other fillings are onions sauteed in olive oil and seasoned with salted anchovies and capers or mortadella and provolone cheese. A different recipe for panzerotti is panzerotti di patate (\\"potato panzerottis\\"), a specialty from Salento which consists of mashed potato croquettes rather than panzerotti as the term is most typically intended. North America Panzerotti are also consumed in North America, where they were imported by Southern Italian immigrants at the time of the Italian diaspora. As for their shape and texture, they can come in various sizes, and are usually semicircular. They consist of a pocket of dough filled with varying amounts of melted mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce and any reasonable number of fillings, which is then folded over and deep-fried. Panzerotto rises during this process, creating a pocket containing a considerable amount of steam which should be partially released prior to eating. Canada Since the mid-1960s, panzerotti have been a popular fast food item in Canada. Commercialized frozen versions are called Pizza Pockets or Pizza Pops.

It was edited and published semiweekly by poet and printer Philip Freneau until October 23, 1793. The National Gazette was founded at the urging of Democratic-Republican leaders James Madison and Thomas Jefferson in order to counter the influence of the rival Federalist newspaper, the Gazette of the United States. Like other papers of the era, the National Gazette centered on its fervent political content. The Gazette's political content was often written pseudonymously, and was directed against the Federalist Party. Many prominent Democratic-Republicans contributed articles, often pseudonymously, including Madison and Jefferson.Burns, p.281 The Gazette is unique among early American partisan newspapers for being substantially supported by a major player within a sitting administration (then Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson) while simultaneously attacking that administration's own policies. Jefferson enticed Freneau to come to Philadelphia to edit the Gazette by hiring him as a translator at the United States Department of State for an annual salary of $250. Federalist writers, including Alexander Hamilton, attacked this as a conflict of interest. Hamilton and other Federalists also financially supported their own partisan newspaper, the Gazette of the United States,Chernow, p.395 although their publication did not attack Washington and his policies, but praised them effusively. Freneau's Gazette spent much of its time criticizing the policies of the Washington administration. The paper described Alexander Hamilton's financial policies in 1792 as \\"numerous evils...pregnant with every mischief\\" and described George Washington's sixty-first birthday celebration as \\"a forerunner of other monarchical vices.\\" The Gazette's strident polemics and screeds against the Washington administration led President Washington to despise the Gazette, and to refer to its editor pejoratively as \\"that Rascal Freneau.\\" The National Gazette unofficially stopped publishing in October 1793, two years after its establishment, citing \\"a considerable quantity of new and elegant printing types from Europe\\" to be obtained, but it is believed that the outbreak of yellow fever in Philadelphia combined with dwindling subscriptions contributed to the paper's demise. Jefferson would later resign as Secretary of State, ending Freneau's main source of income aside from the paper. Another newspaper of the same name was being published in Philadelphia in 1830.

A recent fossil find shows that ferns of Hymenophyllaceae have existed since at least the Upper Triassic.A filmy fern from the Upper Triassic of North Carolina (USA) - Axsmith et al. 88 (9): 1558 - American Journal of Botany Description They often appear as very dark green or even black clumps and may be mistaken for a robust moss or liverwort. The rhizome is usually thin and wiry and the fronds variously pinnate with a single strand (\\"nerve\\") of vascular tissue. As in most ferns, young fronds have circinate vernation. In most species, the frond, apart from the vascular tissue, is only a single cell thick, and they do not have any stomata. The cuticle is also greatly reduced or absent, leaving filmy ferns very susceptible to desiccation where a reliable water supply is not present. The leaves occasionally bear hairs, but scales are generally not present. The sori are borne at the leaf margins at the end of the nerve. They are protected by conical, bivalvate, or tubular indusia. Within the sori, sporangia mature starting at the apex of the sorus and progressing to the base. They have a continuous, oblique annulus and release round, green trilete spores. The spores grow into thread- or ribbon- like gametophytes; in many species, the gametophyte has an extended, independent lifespan and can reproduce asexually by fragmenting or releasing gemmae. Individual plants may persist for many years. Taxonomy In the molecular phylogenetic classification of Smith et al. in 2006, the Hymenophyllales, containing the single family Hymenophyllaceae, were placed in class Polypodiopsida sensu stricto (the leptosporangiate ferns). The linear sequence of Christenhusz et al. (2011), intended for compatibility with the classification of Chase and Reveal (2009) which placed all land plants in Equisetopsida, reclassified Smith's Polypodiopsida as subclass Polypodiidae and placed the Hymenophyllales there. The circumscription of the order and its families was not changed, and that circumscription and placement in Polypodiidae has subsequently been followed in the classifications of Christenhusz and Chase (2014) and PPG I (2016). The division of the family into genera was disputed, . Traditionally, only two genera of Hymenophyllaceae have been recognized: (1) Hymenophyllum with bivalved involucres, and (2) Trichomanes s.l. with tubular involucres. Subsequent proposals have created 34 genera (Copeland 1938), 6 genera (Morton 1968), 47 genera (Sermolli 1977), and 8 genera (Iwatsuki 1984). These classifications all had only limited regional acceptance. Recent molecular phylogenic studies do show two distinct monophyletic clades of fairly equal size, but they are only roughly aligned with the two traditional genera. For example, the traditional Trichomanes subtaxa Pleuromanes and Cardiomanes were shown to belong to the \\"hymenophylloid\\" clade. To reflect these recent discoveries Atsushi Ebihara and Kunio Iwatsuki, in 2006, revised the taxonomy of Hymenophyllaceae to place all species of the \\"hymenophylloid\\" clade in a single genus Hymenophyllum, and to place the eight clear \\"trichomanoid\\" subclades in eight corresponding genera. This subdivision was recognized by Smith et al. in 2006 and Christenhusz et al. in 2011, but Christenhusz and Chase, in 2014, reverted to combining the trichomanoid clades into Trichomanes. The PPG I classification of 2016 again recognizes the segregate genera (and treats the two clades as subfamilies, Hymenophylloideae and Trichomanoideae), although the segregate genera are not always accepted by contemporary floras; e.g., as of 2016, the Flora of New Zealand preferred to recognize Trichomanes s.l. due to the difficulty of morphologically distinguishing the segregate genera. Genera The genera used in PPG I and the subgenera assigned by the system of Ebihara et al. are: *Hymenophylloideae (the \\"hymenophylloid\\" clade): ** – about 250 species ***subg. – about 100 species ***subg. – about 70 species ***subg. – more than 35 species ***subg. – about 25 species ***subg. – 5 species ***subg. – at least 8 species ***subg. – at least 3 species ***subg. – 2 species ***subg. – 1 species ***subg. – 1 species *Trichomanoideae (the \\"trichomanoid\\" clade) (sometimes all included in a single broad genus Trichomanes with about 400 species): ** – more than 30 species ***subg. – more than 20 species ***subg. – more than 10 species ** – more than 30 species ***subg. ***subg. ** – about 15 species ** – more than 15 species ***subg. – more than 15 species ***subg. – at least 2 species ** – about 25 species ***subg. – about 15 species ***subg. – more than 10 species ** – more than 60 species ***subg. – more than 30 species ***subg. – more than 5 species ***subg. – at least 1 species ***subg. – more than 4 species ** – about 4 species ** – about 5 species Distribution and habitat The great majority of the species are found in tropical rainforests, but some also occur in temperate rainforests (particularly New Zealand, with 25 species) and slightly drier forest regions. In Europe they are restricted to the Atlantic Ocean fringes of the continent, notably in the Azores, Ireland, and western Great Britain, but one species (Hymenophyllum tunbrigense) locally east to Luxembourg, another (H. wilsonii) so far north as West Norway, Faeroes and South Iceland, while in North America, they are restricted (often occurring solely as gametophytes) to the humid eastern third of the continent and the rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.

It was founded in 1962 with the donation of Indian artifacts by Dr. Herbert S. Zim and tools by a group of civic minded women. On August 14, 1973, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The Museum's building is located in the old Homestead Florida East Coast Railroad station agent's home that was built in 1904. The house was moved to the current location in the mid-1960s to serve as a museum about the local area. The land the building sits on was donated by Henry and Jacqueline Brooker. Henry was an early settler, homesteading west of the present city of Florida City in 1907. His wife, Jacqueline, was the daughter of Bryan H. Edwards, an early mayor of Florida City. The depot building behind the museum was saved by Jack Levy and other local history buffs as the bulldozers were starting to tear it down where it was originally located on N. Flagler Ave. in Homestead. The FEC and the City of Homestead had gotten into an argument over grounds maintenance so the FEC proceeded to demolish the building. It was then moved to its present site in Florida City in 1976, on land donated by the Torcise family. The building was leveled to the platform by Hurricane Andrew in 1992,floridapioneermuseum.org and the Museum aided in the reconstruction of the building by supplying copies of the original drawings from the Florida East Coast Railway. The Depot is not part of the Museum; it is owned by the City of Florida City.  History  The Florida East Coast Railway erected two bungalow buildings that were constructed in 1904 as the first buildings in the City of Homestead. Both building were residential, and were built for the section foremen and station agent. The homes were built two years before construction began by the Florida East Coast Railway in the area. Henry M. Flagler, an early settler of South Florida, designed the homes in the Philippine style to be well-suited for the South Florida climate. On February 6, 1964, the house was moved to Florida City to land that was donated by Henry and Jackie Brooker Jr. Henry's father was one of the three men who first took residence in Florida City in 1911-1912. This move ensured the continued existence of the structure as it became the home of the Florida Pioneer Museum. The community identified a need for a center to house a growing collection of local artifacts, and through the assistance of the Homestead Women's Club, the Pioneer Museum was created in this structure. Louise Hamilton was the founding president of the Pioneer Museum with Bea Peskoe as Vice President until they stepped down in 1970. The collection housed in the museum started with a donation from Herbert S. Zim, author of the Golden Nature Guides, of Native American artifacts. Other donors provided archaeological relics, shells, pioneer tools and implements, railroad memorabilia, household items, and other items owned and used by various local pioneer families. On August 14, 1973, the structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1976, after years of allowing the dilapidation of the train depot on the original Homestead property, the Florida East Coast Railway planned a demolition of the depot. A group of local leaders raised $25,000 to stop the demolition and move the depot to the property behind the Florida Pioneer Museum. Another $200,000 was put into the restoration of the depot in 1988. Unfortunately, Hurricane Andrew leveled the depot in 1992. The current train depot on the property is a replica of the original. The Museum is now owned by the City of Florida City and operated by the Florida Pioneer Museum Association.

Writ of the Scribe), (1815–1871), was one of the leading rabbis of Hungarian Jewry in the second half of the nineteenth century and rosh yeshiva of the famed Pressburg Yeshiva. His official German name was Samuel Wolf Schreiber. Early years Shmuel Binyomin Sofer was born in Pressburg (now Bratislava) on March 12, 1815. His father, the famed Chasam Sofer, Rabbi of Pressburg, was the leader of Hungarian Jewry and one of the leading Rabbi's of European Jewry. His mother Sarel (1790–1832) was the daughter of Rabbi Akiva Eger, Rabbi of Posen, one of the greatest Talmudic scholars of his time. When he was six years old, his family fell ill and among them little Shmuel Volf, as he was called. The doctors had already given up on him. As a segulah they added \\"Avraham\\" to his name, but to no avail. They already called the Chevra Kadisha and lit candles as was the custom of the time and they said the last rites. Then the doctors approached his father the Chasam Sofer and said \\"We know that you are a Godly and holy man; if with your prayers you cannot help your son; on our part, all hope is lost\\". After hearing this; the Chasam Sofer went to a corner where all his manuscripts were; and said a short prayer. At that time the sick child Avraham Shmuel Binyomin in his great weakness started screaming the Shema, and their prayers were answered; Shmuel Binyomin's condition took a turn for the better. The bewildered doctors said to the Chasam Sofer; now we truly know that you are a Godly man; to which he answered, \\"I hadn't given up hope, not even for a second.\\" The great pupils of the Chasam Sofer later testified that the Chasam Sofer said at the time that \\"for one Jubilee, I begged him out\\"; as Shmuel Binyomin lived for another fifty years and died at age fifty six. He first studied under Rabbi Mordechai Ephraim Fishel Sofer (not a relation, as far as is known) and then entered his father's famous Yeshiva; and became one of its outstanding students. At age eighteen in 1833 he married Chavah Leah Weiss, daughter of Rabbi Yitzchok Weiss of Gorlitz, who was well known for his piety. The latter gave him a large dowry and promised to support him for 15 years. The wedding was held in the town of Kamaren after which the couple settled in Pressburg where Sofer continued his studies and helped his father with the yeshiva. Death and legacy On December 31, 1871 the Ksav Sofer died in Bratislava and the mantle as Rabbi of Pressburg passed to his son, Rabbi Simcha Bunim Sofer known as the Shevet Sofer. Another son, Rabbi Shimon Sofer was appointed as Rabbi of Erlau (Eger). Shimon's grandson Rabbi Yochanan Sofer has established numerous Synagogues in Israel and one in the USA, naming them Kehila Kdosha (trans. Holy Congregation) Ksav Sofer.

As a player, he was a goalkeeper from 1981 until 2001 notably for Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League when the club won the title in 1995. He also played as a professional for Halifax Town, Everton, Rotherham United, Notts County, Sunderland, Manchester City, Aberdeen, Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace, Preston North End, York City and Mansfield Town. He was goalkeeping coach at Hull City until January 2017 and current goalkeeping coach of Bangladesh national football team. Playing career Born in York, Mimms began his football career as an apprentice at Halifax Town. However, he failed to break into the first team and joined Rotherham United in November 1981 for a fee of £15,000. In 1985, he was sold to Everton, who had just won the league title and European Cup Winners' Cup. During the 1980s, Mimms played for no less than eight different clubs, as he went out on loan from Everton more than once. However, due to an injury to Neville Southall, Mimms played in goal for Everton in the final weeks of the 1985–86 season. Everton were top of the league for most of the last three months of the season, but were pipped to the title on the last day by local rivals Liverpool. Liverpool won the FA Cup as well that season, beating Everton 3–1 in the final, with Mimms in goal for the losers. He played as Everton shared the 1986 FA Charity Shield with Liverpool and won the 1987 FA Charity Shield against Coventry City. He was later sold to Tottenham Hotspur in 1988 following the retirement of Ray Clemence, and had more first team chances at White Hart Lane than he had been given at Goodison Park. In December 1990, Blackburn Rovers manager Don Mackay signed him for a fee of £250,000 from Tottenham Hotspur making him Blackburn's most expensive transfer at the time. He was signed in the early stages of Jack Walker's backing of Blackburn, and just weeks before Walker took full control of the Second Division club. Blackburn had a slow start to the 1991–92 season, and Mackay was sacked in early September, being replaced the following month by Kenny Dalglish. Dalglish made several substantial signings during the season and Blackburn reached the playoff final where they beat Leicester City 1–0, ending 26 years outside the top flight. Mimms was one of the players who kept his place in the team throughout the season. Mimms was an integral part of this team. However, Jack Walker was not one to rest on his laurels and after the club's promotion vast amounts of money were spent to recruit the finest talents in the country to Ewood Park. Players such as Alan Shearer, Stuart Ripley, Graeme Le Saux and Kevin Gallacher were brought to the club and Mimms was a key part of the team which finished fourth in the 1992–93 season, just missing out on a UEFA Cup place. In November 1993, Southampton goalkeeper Tim Flowers was brought in as the new number one. From then on, Mimms was rarely selected in the starting line-up, his four appearances in the 1994–95 season not being enough for a title medal, and in early 1996 joined Crystal Palace, where he played just once. He then dropped into the lower divisions, playing for Preston North End, Rotherham United, hometown club York City and finished off his playing career at Mansfield Town in 2001. Coaching career Between 2001 and 2008 Mimms worked as goalkeeping coach at Wolverhampton Wanderers, before returning to Blackburn to fulfil the same role in August 2008. until he was sacked on 27 December 2012. During the pre-season preceding the 2013/14 season Mimms was appointed goalkeeping coach at Oldham Athletic. In February 2014, he left his role at Oldham to join the Bahrain national football team as their new national team goalkeeping coach. In October 2014 Mimms was appointed as goalkeeping coach at Premier League side West Ham United. After leaving West Ham, he had short spells coaching at Blackpool and Bolton Wanderers and in November 2016 joined the coaching staff at Hull City following goalkeeper coach Gary Walsh's move to Aston Villa. He left the club in January 2017, following the sacking of head coach Mike Phelan. After leaving Hull City he joined Jamshedpur in the Indian Super League as a goalkeeper coach under Steve Coppell in September 2017. In June 2018 he joined ATK with Steve Coppell as a goalkeeper coach. After the sacking of Coppell he also left the club after Super cup in April 2019. In 2019 June he was appointed as the goalkeeper coach of Bangladesh national football team.

Wadsworth of Geneseo: Brevet Major-General of United States Volunteers William Wadsworth (1765 in Durham, Connecticut – 15 February 1833 in Geneseo, New York) was an officer in the New York State militia, before and during the War of 1812. As a Brigadier General, he commanded the New York militia contingent in the American army at the Battle of Queenston Heights. He waived his right to command over Lieutenant Colonel Winfield Scott, of the United States Army. During the battle, he faced the enemy at all times so he would not be shot in the back and appear to be cowardly. Waving his sword and swearing at the troops back across the river, hoping to instill the fighting spirit in them, he made a genuine but vain attempt to get the militia to cross and reinforce their position. At the end of the battle, Wadsworth was taken prisoner when the American force, cut off on the Canadian side of the Niagara River, surrendered to avoid a massacre by Indians under John Brant attached to the British force.  Family  William Wadsworth was a scion of the prominent Wadsworth family of Connecticut. He was a sixth generation descendant of William Wadsworth (1595–1675) who was one of the Founders of Hartford, Connecticut. In 1790, with his charismatic brother James Wadsworth, he moved from Connecticut to the Genesee Valley of Western New York State. Settling in \\"Big Tree\\" on June 9, 1790, on the east bank of the Genesee River, William and his brother went from the leading pioneers of this unsettled region to one of its largest wealthiest land holders. As the settlement in the area increased, William was elected Town supervisor for 21 years. Before and during his tenure, William created and took charge of the area's local militia and eventually took command of the Genesee Valley militia. By the time hostilities broke out between the U.S. and Great Britain in 1812, William Wadsworth was promoted to Brigadier General. William never married and history records no known children. Visit from the Duke Despite the fact William and his brother were now by any standard wealthy, they were living in their first log cabin when, in the summer of 1795, the Duke François Alexandre Frédéric, duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt arrived from Canawaugus, New York with his entourage of a young Englishman, servants and a poodle named Cartouche. The duke, who had letters of introduction to \\"those great American Landlords, Messrs. James and William Wadsworth\\", was somewhat taken aback by their manorial dwelling. He described it in his memoirs as \\"a small log house as dirty as any I have ever seen\\" It was cluttered with stores of all kinds and live chickens. The duke says, \\"It stank so I could hardly bear it.\\" The duke's dog apparently ate one of Wadsworth's chickens and his servant Jenny told that \\"eminent nobleman\\" what she thought of him and his dog. William's hospitality extended him an invitation to \\"stay for a week,\\" which was hastily declined. The duke stayed the night, but William could not see them off properly, as Captain, he had to attend to the muster of militia early the following morning. The duke left that day for Buffalo and continued on his \\"Grand Tour\\" into Canada. Treaty of Big Tree Between August 20, 1797 and September 16, 1797, William Wadsworth hosted the United States delegation for the Treaty of Big Tree in his log cabin and new cobblestone house. A meadow between the Wadsworths' cabin at Big Tree and the gigantic oak by the river, which gave the place its name, was the site of the conference. Nearly three thousand Seneca and other members of the Six Nations of the Iroquois attended the conference. Their representatives were the Chiefs Cornplanter, Red Jacket, Farmer's Brother, Tall Chief, Little Beard and others, the Clan Mothers of the nation, and Mary Jemison. The United States' representatives were Colonel Jeremiah Wadsworth, Commissioner representing the US Government, Thomas Morris representing his father, Robert Morris, General William Shepard representing Massachusetts, Theophilus Cazenove and Paolo Busti, representatives for the Holland Land Company, Captain Israel Chapin, representing the Department of Indian Affairs, Joseph Ellicott, Land surveyor, and James Rees as acting secretary. The treaty was signed on September 16, 1797 after nearly a month of sometimes heated, back and forth negotiations. It opened up the territory west of the Genesee River and established ten Reservations for the Seneca in Western New York. Battle of Queenston Heights On June 18, 1812 War was declared between the United States and Great Britain. That same day, William Wadsworth was promoted to Brigadier General and put in command of the 7th Brigade, 1st Division made up of the 18th, 19th, and 20th regiments of the New York State Detached Militia. These regiments represented the Counties of Seneca, Cayuga and Ontario respectively. The 20th Regiment contained the various companies of Ontario County, New York in which was William's original Geneseo Company now under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Peter Allen. At the outbreak of the War of 1812, the Niagara Frontier was unprepared to defend its settlements. Many who lived along the Niagara River which separates Canada from New York were alarmed by the military activity on the Canadian side of the river. They wrote to New York Congressman and Quartermaster General, Peter B. Porter, on April 15, 1812, about their concerns of the lack of arms and ammunition, adding \\"there is not five muskets that is fit to use in this place & they are not to be had in this quarter.\\" Governor Daniel D. Tompkins was made aware the New York Militia was destitute of arms, camp equipment, blankets, and other items. Particularly, at the settlements of Black Rock, now a part of Buffalo, New York, and the settlement at Lewiston, New York. On June 25, 1812, one week after his promotion and the declaration of war, Governor Tompkins ordered Brigadier General William Wadsworth and his newly formed 7th Brigade, with two cannons and ball, to command the Niagara Frontier and reinforce the 400 regular army at Black Rock. The Governor's instruction made it clear Wadsworth was \\"at liberty to act offensively as well as defensively\\" according to the circumstances along the river. Wadsworth confessed to the governor, in a letter, that he lacked military experience and was \\"ignorant of even the minor duties of the duty to which you have assigned me,\\" and asked to have an experienced \\"military secretary\\" assigned to him, a request to which the governor complied. The Governor later assigned the more experienced Major General Amos Hall to overall command of the Niagara Frontier militia on July 28, 1812, until Major General Stephen van Rensselaer could assume the command on August 11, 1812. It was for these reasons Wadsworth earned the epitaph \\"the reluctant general.\\" Wadsworth marched his column of about 900 men from Canandaigua and reached Batavia on July 1, picking up U.S. regular troops along the way. These consisted of the 13th U.S. Infantry Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel John Chrystie and Major James Mullany; the 23rd Infantry Regiment under Lieutenant William Clarke; and the 3rd U.S. Artillery Regiment under Captain James McKeon. Wadsworth reached Black Rock on July 3 with a combined force of 1600 men. He immediately dispatched militia reinforcements to Fort Schlosser at Niagara Falls, New York and to Lewiston and sent the detachment of regulars on to Fort Niagara. About a week later four more companies of volunteer militia attached to the 20th regiment arrived, along with 20 horsemen acting as courier riders. This group brought General Wadsworth's combined strength to nearly 1,900 men at arms (including invalids and absentees) by July 10, 1812. General Wadsworth immediately appraised the defenses between Buffalo and Fort Niagara. He reports that Fort Niagara \\"is very much decayed\\" and under gunned. He requested heavy ordnance and field artillery. He asked the Governor to dispatch 2,000 more troops and that he immediately send food, tents, shoes and equipment for the men currently there. He went to work building batteries and breast works, but this was nearly futile \\"without axes, hoes, shovels or anything of this kind.\\" Per Wadsworth's request, Governor Tompkins sent his personal assistant, the engineer and artillerist Nicholas Gray, to assist Wadsworth. Upon his arrival on July 18, Gray reported to Tompkins that he was impressed with General Wadsworth who's \\"camps were in good health and orderly\\" and that he \\"had ordered a military school, both for officers and soldiers... and pays unwearied attention to the troops, and is forming a system which has as its objective the organization of the staff and camp duties.\\" On July 24, 1812 Major General Amos Hall arrived at Buffalo and took command, but this was only temporary, as both Wadsworth and Hall knew they were to be replaced soon. On August 11, 1812 Major General Stephen Van Rensselaer arrived to Lewiston and took Command. On September 4, 1812 Major General Van Rennselaer writes in his general orders \\"To the Commanding officer of the 7th Brigade [General Wadsworth] and to the Colonels of the 18th and 20th Regiments [Wadsworth's original Company], the General tenders his acknowledgments, for the strict discipline of their troops and the preservation of their health.\\" This order following months of successive general orders issuing complaints and instructions to the officers about the troop's lack of discipline, order, and sanitation. Stephan Van Rensselaer was a popular Federalist politician and an opponent in the gubernatorial candidacy of New York in 1813. His rival, Governor Tompkins, had appointed him to command the American army for political purposes, perhaps to get rid of him, as he was an inexperienced commander. Under presidential pressure from Washington, D.C. Van Rensselaer began making plans to cross the Niagara River from his base at Lewiston, NY to capture the village of Queenston, Ontario and the nearby heights. He ordered Brigadier General Alexander Smyth to join him in Lewiston with his troops on October 11, 1812. However, Smyth, of the regular US Army, commanding at Buffalo, had issues with taking orders from him. Believing van Rensselaer's hasty maneuver unwise, he and his men remained conspicuously absent from the campaign that followed. In the pre-dawn hours of October 13, 1812, Lieutenant Colonel John Chrystie and the first landing party made their way across the river. After Col. Chrystie's boat came under surprise fire, his crew retreated to Lewiston. Captain John E. Wool, having landed, took command of the 13th United States Infantry Regiment, led a group of American soldiers up a fisherman's path to the British artillery stationed on top of the heights. His men were able to take out the British artillery emplacements on Queenston Heights. After realizing the Americans had landed, British Major General Isaac Brock sent a message from Queenston to British Major General Roger H. Sheaffe at Fort George, requesting immediate reinforcements to block the American landings. In the meantime General Brock ordered his men and Indian Allies to retake the heights. Major General Van Rensselaer worked to consolidate the position on the Canadian side of the river. Ordering the heights to be fortified, he placed Lieutenant Colonel Winfield Scott in command with Brigadier General William Wadsworth leading the militia. Despite the earlier success, Van Rensselaer's position was tenuous as only around 600 men had crossed being 350 Regular Army and only 250 Militia had volunteered to cross with Wadsworth. After Van Rensselaer gave command of the invasion party to Lieutenant Colonel Winfield Scott. Major Isaac Roach recalls that when Scott \\"took command he did not know there was a General officer on the grounds. The latter [Wadsworth], who was in plain clothes at the time, modestly made his rank known, insisted on supporting Scott, which he did, with zeal and valor, in every combat.\\" General Brock led the British charge up the heights that nearly succeeded, but it ultimately was repelled. Brock, an obvious target with his commanding height and general's uniform, was wounded in the hand and then shot and killed by American sharpshooters. A second charge, this time under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John Macdonell, soon followed. The Americans repulsed this second change, killing Macdonell and severely wounding Captain Wool in the thigh. Meanwhile, General Wadsworth with a detachment of militia volunteers and Winfield Scott's regulars crossed the river to reinforce Captain Wool's position and take command. Wadsworth had hoped \\"that his example might have a better effect than his orders in making the militia cross.\\" British reinforcements arrived from Fort George to Queenston, including British artillery. Opening fire from the village, it made crossing the river hazardous. On the heights 300 Iroquois began attacking Scott and Wadsworth's outposts. Frustrated, van Rensselaer worked tirelessly to convince the militia to embark to reinforce Scott and Wadsworth. However, most of the citizen Militia, low on ammunition, knowing reinforcements were not in the vicinity, hearing the war cries of the Indians, and in full view of the British reinforcements approaching across the river, stood by their known right, as volunteer militia, to refuse to invade or fight in a foreign country. By law, militiamen were not required to cross a border under arms, but could volunteer to do so. Ultimately unsuccessful, Van Rensselaer dispatched a note to Scott and Wadsworth giving them permission \\"to withdraw if the situation warranted.\\" Abandoned by the militia, hearing the Mohawk war cries under John Brant and fearing massacre, Wadsworth's men retreated. During their retreat Wadsworth was wounded in the right arm. His line collapsing, Scott, too, fell back, ultimately retreating down the slope above the river. With no escape and the Mohawks, embittered over the loss of two chiefs, in pursuit, Scott was forced to surrender the remnants of his command to British Major General Roger Sheaffe. Wadsworth's men too, soon ran out of ammunition and were forced back to the edge of the heights where \\"Thousands could testify to seeing him [Wadsworth] standing on... land at the edge of the bluff, pleading... to his men on the safe bank to join him and save the day. When they would not, he shook his bright sword and cursed them so terribly that one awed eyewitness wrote, 'His language was said to be the worst in the whole American Army'.\\" Another witness later described Wadsworth as \\"the most eloquently profane officer in the [US] army.\\" After the bugles hailed the cease-fire, General Wadsworth was brought before General Roger H. Sheaffe. Upon introductions, British Captain James Crooks recalls, Wadsworth \\"drew his sword and presented the handle to General Sheaffe who said, 'I understand General your people have surrendered,' to which Wadsworth made no other answer other than bowing his head in token that it was so.\\" The British tallied the total number captured at 436 regulars and 489 of militia. They released the walking wounded the day after the battle. The militia was released on parole on October 15. Surprisingly, among them was Brigadier General William Wadsworth, who had negotiated the release of Major James Mullany and Captain Peter Ogilvie. The release of such high-ranking officers was the cause of much consternation and dismay among the British troops and their Indian allies. General Sheaffe relates he allowed Wadsworth's release in the hope \\"his going with the militia will... only tend to ensure a strict execution of the agreement.\\" The other regular officers were released several months later after the terms of the exchange agreement between the parties was honored. Shortly after his parole General Wadsworth returned to his home on the Genesee Valley to recuperate. Though disappointed with the lack of militia to volunteer on that fateful day Wadsworth still defends them. He later writes to Van Rensselaer, \\"I do not say where the regulars and militia who were not there... were, but it is clear they were not where they ought to have been. ...I am conscious that on the 13th and that on every other day during the campaign, I endeavored to do my duty. With this I shall rest satisfied, however others may estimate my services. I am aware that the militia have their faults, but they have their merit, too, and it is that merit of which they ought not to be deprived, unless it is intended to render them useless in the future.\\" When William died in 1833 his brother James Wadsworth inherited his estate. His obituary noted that \\"Few officers... have been more universally respected and beloved by their soldiers.\\"  References   Further reading  *\\"History of the Pioneer Settlement of Phelps and Gorham's Purchase and Morris; Reserve:...\\" by O.

The company began in Williamsburg, New York, United States, later moving its headquarters and manufacturing to Rockaway Beach, Queens. The headquarters remained in Rockaway when manufacturing was later moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania. Sherwood Ross, against the advice of his vice president Randy Ross, retooled the Allentown factory and experimented in unrelated bicycle endeavors involving government contracts. Randy Ross moved Ross bicycles manufacturing to Taiwan to keep margins competitive and bicycle manufacturing profitable, but Sherwood Ross's decision to keep the Allentown factory working on government contracts ultimately led to the company having to file for bankruptcy protection in 1988 Ross Bicycles was re-established on July 31, 2017 by Shaun Ross, the current CEO of Ross Bicycles. Ross competed domestically with bicycle manufacturers including Schwinn and Huffy, and was noted as a pioneering manufacturer of mountain bikes. History Ross was started by Albert Ross as Ross Galvanizing Works in 1940, \\"manufacturing and galvanizing pipes and pipe fittings for the fencing industry and later galvanized steel parts for military ships during World War II.\\" After World War II, it was incorporated as Chain Bike Corp. in 1946. Ross' first factory was on Kent Avenue in Williamsburg, New York, near the Schaefer Brewery and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The company moved to Beach 79th Street in Rockaway Beach, Queens (now Far Rockaway) some time around 1960, the company was renamed Ross Bicycles Inc. on May 21, 1982, and in 1973 manufacturing was moved to a new, purpose-built plant in Allentown, Pennsylvania.http://mombatbicycles.com/MOMBAT/BikeHistoryPages/Ross.html In 1982, Ross Bicycles was the first ever bicycle manufacturer to mass produce the mountain bike. In 1983, Randy Ross created the first mountain bike race team, the Ross Indians. Ross had models that directly competed with the Schwinn Side Winder called the Ross Diamond Cruiser. Ross introduced their first production MTB, the Force 1, during the first Interbike Show in October 1982; the bike's name was later changed to the Mt. Hood. In early 1982 Ross Signature (hand made bike department) was making custom mountain bikes. Jim Redcay was the builder; Tom Kellogg was working on road bikes. Redcay was also involved in the Force 1 frame development. This was the first bike Ross had built in Allentown with cantilever brakes. The Allentown factory was said to be retooled for government contracts by Sherwood Ross. Ross moved bicycle production to Taiwan in 1986 to keep the margins profitable, but the government contracts and financial strain from the Allentown factories unsuccessful government endeavors, led to Ross Bicycles filing for bankruptcy protection in 1988. In addition to bicycles, Ross manufactured ammunition boxes for the US government at its Lehigh facility, and cited the government contract as the source of its financial difficulties at the time of filing for Chapter 11 protection. The Ross name was purchased by Rand Cycle in Farmingdale, New York, which suffered a recall of 11,000 mountain bikes in 1998. Randy Ross, grandson of Albert, introduced a stair stepper bike in 2007. Shaun Ross re-established Ross Bicycles on July 31, 2017. Albert Ross' son Sherwood (Jerry) B. Ross (1921-2013) was CEO of Ross Bicycles from 1946 to 1990, held several bicycle-related patents, served as President of the Bicycle Institute of America (BIA) and the Bicycle Manufacturers Association (BMA), and acted as an expert witness in product liability cases. Bicycles Ross began making bicycles in 1946, and by the late 1960s, manufactured about 1 million bicycles per year. By 1985, it had sold 10 million bicycles. The company, still known as Chain Bicycle Corporation, marketed bikes under the Ross brand, including children's bikes as well as BMX, touring, cruiser, mountain, racing, wheelie, and stationary exercise bicycles. In 1968, Ross joined the muscle bike craze with models such as the Marlin with a console mounted stick brake, the Barracuda with a chrome twin stick shift console, and the Barracuda Beast with a Futura sports car steering wheel. In 1982, Ross introduced one of the first production mountain bikes, the Force One, at Interbike. In 1983, they launched the first professional factory sponsored mountain bike race team, the Ross Indians. With the rising popularity of mountain bikes, Randy Ross, Sherwood Ross's son and executive vice president of Ross Bicycles Inc., said in the New York Times, \\"these bikes are one of the biggest things that ever happened to the biking industry. Its basic look constitutes 'a total shift in image' for the industry.\\" By 1989, Nyle Nims, then a vice president at Ross Bicycles (and later founder of Cycle Force Group), said that 40 percent of bicycle sales were mountain bikes, adding, \\"we see a lot of people who previously owned the dropped bar, 10-speed bike buying the wide-tire bikes, they are people who don't want to ride fast; they want to ride for recreation.\\" References External links *RandyRossStepper Corp.

An atlas can consist of uniformly-sized images or images of varying dimensions. A sub-image is drawn using custom texture coordinates to pick it out of the atlas. Benefits In an application where many small textures are used frequently, it is often more efficient to store the textures in a texture atlas which is treated as a single unit by the graphics hardware. This reduces the overhead of a context switch by increasing memory locality. Careful alignment may be needed to avoid bleeding between sub textures when used with mipmapping and texture compression. In web development, images are packed into a sprite sheet to reduce the number of image resources that need to be fetched in order to display a page.

Guarisco of Allmusic described it as \\"an exuberant horn-driven number that mixes pop and soul elements in to spice up its predominantly reggae sound\\".Rudie Can't Fail at Allmusic Lyrics \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\" praises the rude boys of Jamaica in the 1960s who challenged their elders' status quo. The song is about a fun-loving young man who is criticised by his elders for not acting as a responsible adult, drinking beer before breakfast, and describe him as being \\"so crude and feckless\\", to which he responds \\"I know that my life make you nervous, but I tell you I can't live in service.\\" The song's title derives from Desmond Dekker's 1967 song \\"007 (Shanty Town)\\", and is in homage to Ray Gange, who had portrayed a roadie who quits his job to follow The Clash around in the 1980 film Rude Boy. Rudie Can't Fail was the working title of a planned second movie for which The Clash would provide the soundtrack. Reference is made also to Dr Alimantado, in the line \\"Like the doctor who was born for a purpose\\". Its name commonly appears at the end of \\"Safe European Home\\" from Give 'Em Enough Rope.  In popular culture  The song Roses in the Hospital by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers references the song in its outro where lead singer James Dean Bradfield can be heard singing the line \\"Rudie gonna fail\\", fitting with the pessimistic tone of the Manics' early works.

Rey specializes in blues and jazz from 1900 to 1950. She developed a Women in American Music concert/lecture series to provide an historical and cultural look at the contribution of women to music in the early 20th century. She is recognized for her syncopated style of guitar and intricate finger picking. Early Life Rey grew up with her mother, Eileen, and father, Stan. They lived a bohemian life, moving frequently, until settling down in San Diego, California. Rey became interested in the guitar when her mother bought one in 1964. She was just four years old. Her father bought a second, smaller guitar, and Rey and her mother would follow along to Frederick Noad's guitar lessons on PBS in their trailer park's rec room where there was a television. Rey told a reporter, \\"I like to tell people that I approach music with an autodidact trailer-park aesthetic.\\" By the age of 7, Rey performed in a talent show. In her early teens, Rey frequented a local music shop called \\"Folk Arts Rare Records\\" owned by Lou Curtiss, mentor to Tom Waits. It was through Curtiss she met Sam Chatmon, performing with him onstage. Her other influences included Bo Carter and Memphis Minnie. Rey gravitated toward 1900 to 1920s ragtime and 1920 to 1950s blues when, she said, music had \\"more regional accents\\" and was not so \\"commodified and mass-marketed.\\" A huge fan of Memphis Minnie, Rey described her as someone who did not fit into a stereotypical cultural myth. She played \\"killer guitar\\" and was \\"a woman performer who was at her best in middle age and who chewed tobacco.\\" Rey attended college in Santa Cruz, but dropped out to pursue her career in music. Career By 1980, Rey was performing in Santa Cruz with Bob Brozman. Tired of being drowned out by his resonator guitar, she purchased a '38 National Style O. She played the National until meeting Ron Phillips, a luthier, who custom made her a resonator guitar. In 1991, Rey met Steve James in Santa Cruz, California. Later becoming a couple, they started performing together at a Port Townsend Country Blues workshop in 2001. In the same year, Rey released a cassette-only recording \\"Chartreuse.\\" By 1993, Rey had her own label, Hobemian Records, and released Boogie Mysterioso, followed by Hot Sauce in 1995. Her music was a blend of country blues, stride piano, classic jazz, hillbilly boogie and Tin Pan Alley. In 2003, Rey released Del Rey: Live, a collection of performances and followed up with Tonight, a 15-track album with James. This 2004 release received European and Asian distribution. In 2004, Rey started performing with the Yes Yes Boys. She played a Phillips resonator ukulele, an instrument she started playing at the urging of her friend and fellow musician, Sandy Hines. She describes her playing as a mix of Piedmont and upper Mississippi styles. As her skills on the ukulele developed, Rey began giving workshops and lessons at festivals. In describing her experience with the ukulele, Rey said, \\"All the different kinds of experiences - whether it's a sad song or a dance piece or something funny or insightful - it's all there. You just have to digging and not go, 'Oh well, I can't play that because I don't have another string.' There are no excuses. It's all there.\\" Rey has gone on to produce multiple solo and collaborative albums, including X-Rey Guitar (2000), When the Levee Breaks (2006), Blue Uke (2008), and Solo Del Rey (2016) Rey tours worldwide and also writes about music for Acoustic Guitar magazine and other publications. Women in American Music Rey developed a lecture series called Women in American Music, featuring female musicians such as Memphis Minnie, Lovie Austin, Rose Maddox, and Mary Osborne. The series, which she calls her \\"Memphis ministry,\\" is an historical and cultural look at contributions of women to the music of the 1900-1950s. The academic program includes blues, swing jazz, Hispanic and hillbilly music. In 1997, with a commission from the Guitar Festival in Dubendorf, Switzerland, she created a touring art exhibit called Women with Guitar. The exhibit includes historical photos and archival film footage from the early 20th century of influential women pioneers in the early jazz, country, and blues movements such as Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Memphis Minnie, Maybelle Carter, Lydia Mendoza and others.

A coffee ceremony is a ritualized procedure of making and drinking coffee in Habesha community. The coffee ceremony was first practiced by the south western Ethiopians people.https://www.future-trans.com/education/amazing-facts-about- tigrani-and-tigrayans/ There is a routine of serving coffee on a daily basis, mainly for the purpose of getting together with relatives, neighbors, or other visitors. If coffee is politely declined, then tea will most likely be served. Loose grass is spread on the floor where the coffee ceremony is held, often decorated with small yellow flowers. Composite flowers are sometimes used, especially around the celebration of Meskel (an Orthodox Holiday celebrated by Ethiopians). Brewing The ceremony is typically performed by the woman of the household and is considered an honor. The coffee is brewed by first roasting the green coffee beans over an open flame in a pan. This is followed by the grinding of the beans, traditionally in a wooden mortar and pestle. The coffee grounds are then put into a special vessel which contain boiled water and will be left on an open flame a couple of minutes until it is well mixed with the hot water. After grinding, the coffee is put through a sieve several times. The boiling pot (jebena) is usually made of pottery and has a spherical base, a neck and pouring spout, and a handle where the neck connects with the base. The jebena also has a straw lid. Serving Ambasha is sometimes used as snack during the ceremonies The host pours the coffee for all participants by moving the tilted boiling pot over a tray with small, handleless cups from a height of one foot without stop until each cup is full. The grounds are brewed three times: the first round of coffee is called awel in Tigrinya, the second kale'i and the third baraka ('to be blessed'). In Amharic it's አቦል abol, the second ቶና tona and the third በረካ baraka . The coffee ceremony may also include burning of various traditional incense. People add sugar to their coffee, or in the countryside, sometimes salt or traditional butter (see niter kibbeh). The beverage is accompanied by a small snack such as popcorn, peanuts or himbasha (also called ambasha).

These standards can then be used to guide all other system components. The SBE (standards-based education) reform movement calls for clear, measurable standards for all school students. Rather than norm-referenced rankings, a standards-based system measures each student against the concrete standard. Curriculum, assessments, and professional development are aligned to the standards.  Outcomes-based education Standards are an evolution of the earlier OBE (outcomes-based education) which was largely rejected in the United States as unworkable in the 1990s, and is still being implemented by some and abandoned by other governments. In contrast, the more modest \\"standards\\" reform has been limited to the core goals of the OBE programs: * the creation of curriculum frameworks which outline specific knowledge or skills which students must acquire, * an emphasis on criterion-referenced assessments which are aligned to the frameworks, and * the imposition of some high-stakes tests, such as graduation examinations requiring a high standard of performance to receive a diploma. In the process of establishing standards for each individual curriculum area, such as mathematics and science, many other reforms, such as inquiry-based science may be implemented, but these are not core aspects of the standards program. The standards movement can be traced to the efforts of Marc Tucker's NCEE which adapted aspects of William Spady's OBE movement into a system based on creating standards and assessments for a Certificate of Initial Mastery. This credential has since been abandoned by every state which first adopted the concept, including Washington and Oregon and largely replaced by graduation examinations. His organization had contracts with states and districts covering as many as half of all American school children by their own claims, and many states enacted education reform legislation in the early 1990s based on this model, which was also known at the time as \\"performance-based education\\" as OBE (and the non-OBE progressive reforms co-marketed with it) had been too widely attacked to be saleable under that name. Though the standards movement has a stronger backing from conservatives than OBE by adopting a platform of raising higher academic standards, other conservatives believe that it is merely a re-labeling of a failed, unrealistic vision. It is believed to be the educational equivalent of a planned economy which attempts to require all children to perform at world- class levels merely by raising expectations and imposing punishments and sanctions on schools and children who fall short of the new standards. Vision The vision of the standards-based education reform movement is that all teenagers will receive a meaningful high school diploma that serves essentially as a public guarantee that they can read, write, and do basic mathematics (typically through first-year algebra) at a level which might be useful to an employer. To avoid a surprising failure at the end of high school, standards trickle down through all the lower grades, with regular assessments through a variety of means. No student, by virtue of poverty, age, race, gender, cultural or ethnic background, disabilities, or family situation will ultimately be exempt from learning the required material, although it is acknowledged that individual students may learn in different ways and at different rates. Standards are chosen through political discussions that focus on what students will need to learn to be competitive in the job market, instead of by textbook publishers or education professors or tradition. Standards are normally published and freely available to parents and taxpayers as well as professional educators and textbook writers. Standards focus on the goal of a literate and economically competitive workforce. * Standards outline what students need to know, understand, and be able to do. * Standards should be developmentally appropriate and relevant to future employment and education needs.James D. Ellis The Influence of the National Science Education Standards on the Science Curriculum, University of Kansas, National Academy of Sciences Standards should generally be written so that all students are capable of achieving them, and so that talented students will exceed them. * All students are believed to be capable of learning and of meeting high expectations. Both advanced and struggling students can learn new things in their own ways and at their own rates. * Instruction that helps an individual student learn the information and skills listed in the standards is emphasized. * Both excellence and equity are valued. Subgroups are carefully measured to identify and reduce systemic racism, bias, and the tyranny of low expectations. * Professional teachers are empowered to make the decisions essential for effective learning, rather than having a teaching style prescribed under traditional education models. * Social promotion is discouraged. Students advance or are retained based on their actual learning achievements instead of based on their age, their friends' achievements, or tradition.  Components  Some of the common components of standards-based education reform are: * Creation of specific, concrete, measurable standards in an integrated curriculum framework. These standards apply to all schools in a state or country, regardless of race or relative wealth. * Criterion-referenced tests based on these standards rather than norm-based relative rankings (which compare one student with another). * An assertion that the new standards are higher than the pre-reform expectations for middle-class or upper-middle-class students. * A requirement that attention be paid to narrowing academic gaps between groups such as races, income, or gender. * High school graduation examinations, which are a form of high-stakes testing that denies diplomas to students who do not meet the stated standards, such as being able to read at the eighth-grade level or do pre-algebra mathematics. The Regents Examination in New York, first given in 1878, is the oldest high school graduation exam in the U.S. In most educational systems, students who can not pass the test are given a certificate of attendance instead of a normal diploma. History Standards-based education reform in the United States began with the publication of A Nation at Risk in 1983.The Virginia Standards of Learning. cepionline.org In 1989, an education summit involving all fifty state governors and President George H. W. Bush resulted in the adoption of national education goals for the year 2000; the goals included content standards. That same year, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics published the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics, a standards-based document. A standards based vision was enacted under the Clinton Administration in 1994. A reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was passed to ensure that all states had rigorous standards for all subject areas and grade levels. This vision was then carried forward by the Bush Administration in 2001 with the passing of No Child Left Behind (NCLB).Lorrie Shepard, Jane Hannaway, Eva Baker (eds.)

By the 1996 National Education Summit, 44 governors and 50 corporate CEOs set the priorities (Achieve, 1998)Standards-Based Reform. Virtual.clemson.edu. Retrieved on 2012-05-18. * High academic standards and expectations for all students. * Tests that are more rigorous and more challenging, to measure whether students are meeting those standards. * Accountability systems that provide incentives and rewards for educators, students, and parents to work together to help students reach these standards. By 1998, almost every state had implemented or was in the process of implementing academic standards for their students in math and reading. Principals and teachers have received bonuses or been fired, students have been promoted or retained in their current grade, and legislation has been passed so that high school students will graduate or be denied a diploma based on whether or not they had met the standards, usually as measured by a criterion-referenced test. The standards-based National Education Goals (Goals 2000) were set by the U.S. Congress in the 1990s. Many of these goals were based on the principles of outcomes-based education, and not all of the goals were attained by the year 2000 as was intended. The movement resulted in the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001, which required that states make yearly progress towards having all students be proficient by 2014, as evidenced by annual standardized testing. In response to growing public disapproval with NCLB as the deadline approached without any state being able to reach this goal, the Obama administration began granting waivers to states exempting them from NCLB testing requirements. The waivers were linked to various reforms, such as the adoption of common standards by a consortium of states, of which the Common Core was the only one. In December 2015, President Obama signed the Every Student Succeeds Act into law devolving many of NCLB's testing requirements to the states.  Critics  Aspects of standards-based education reform came under scrutiny in the 1990s. Some education researchers, such as UCLA's Gary Orfield disagreed that all students should pass a rigorous test just to get a high school diploma. Others, such as the website Mathematically Correct, questioned the NCTM standards approach to teaching mathematics from 1997 to 2003. Some state standards have been criticized for either not being specific as to academic content, or not implementing curricula which follow the new standards. Advocates of traditional education believe it is not realistic to expect all students to perform at the same level as the best students, nor to punish students simply because they do not perform as well as the most academically talented.

He has represented over 30 acts in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, including The Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson, The Jackson 5, Carlos Santana, Aerosmith, The Beach Boys, ZZ Top, Fleetwood Mac, Bee Gees, Earth, Wind And Fire, John Fogerty and The Doors, which is believed to be more than any other entertainment attorney. As a partner and head of the Music Department in the entertainment law firm of Ziffren Brittenham, Branca is one of a handful of attorneys to have been included in all editions of the prestigious Best Lawyers in America. Marquis Who's Who named Branca the World's #1 Music Attorney in 2019. Branca is currently the chairman of The Michael Jackson Company, and serves as Co-Executor of the Michael Jackson Estate. Billboard named Branca its 2016 \\"Lawyer of the Year\\" Background His mother, Barbara May Theresa Werle (October 6, 1928 - January 1, 2013) was an entertainer and Harvest Moon Ball winner who danced on The Ed Sullivan Show. She moved to Los Angeles when Branca was four to pursue her show business career. Branca lived with his father, also named John, who later served as the New York State Athletic Commissioner. (His uncle, Ralph Branca, pitched for the Brooklyn Dodgers for many years, including the 1947 World Series. He is portrayed in the Jackie Robinson biopic \\"42\\" as one of Robinson's earliest supporters.) At age 11, Branca moved to LA, and at 13, started a rock band, The Other Half, for which he played guitar. Three years later, he played with a band that occasionally opened for The Doors at LA's Hullabaloo Club. He majored in music at Los Angeles City College before transferring to Occidental College. Upon graduating, he enrolled at UCLA School of Law, serving as editor-in-chief of one of the law reviews, and received his degree in 1975. While working as an estate planner at the firm of Kindel & Anderson, Branca came across a Time Magazine profile of Elton John which mentioned entertainment lawyers. Branca realized that this field of law was his true calling. Career highlights Michael Jackson John Branca Branca was hired by Jackson after he fired his father Joseph Jackson as his manager of his career. He was also an instrumental in the production and release of Michael Jackson's Thriller short film. Before Thriller, music videos typically had budgets of $50,000—however, Jackson spent over $1 million on the music video of Thriller. Branca financed it by persuading Showtime to pony up $1.2 million for a Making of \\"Thriller\\" video, the first \\"making of\\" documentary for a music video. In the video, Jackson turns into a werewolf. At the time, Jackson was a Jehovah's Witness, and church elders berated him for promoting demonology. Jackson ordered Branca, who had the sole copy, to destroy it. Branca told Jackson that Bela Lugosi, whom Jackson adored, and who played Dracula in the movies, was also religious and had put a disclaimer at the beginning of Dracula stating that he didn't endorse vampirism. This anecdote persuaded Jackson to put a similar disclaimer on Thriller and allow it to be released. In the five days following, the Thriller album - already out for 1½ years, sold another million copies. Ultimately, Thriller sold an estimated 110 million copies. The success of the video caused rock groups and record companies to consider music videos an essential part of the way rock music was packaged and sold. Branca helped Jackson to purchase ATV Music Publishing in 1985 for $47,500,000 (which held the copyrights to The Beatles' and Little Richard's songs). Within a few years the catalog was worth more than $400,000,000. Branca was also instrumental in facilitating the merger of ATV with Sony, creating one of the world's largest independent music publishers. In 2016, Sony agreed to buy the estate's share of the catalogue for $750 million. Billboard estimated that, in addition to the $750 million, Jackson and his estate collected another $560 million over the years from its Sony/ATV investment. Shot Tower Capital analyzed the investment and concluded that the estate's investment averaged a return in excess of 30 percent annually from its inception in 1985 to the 2016 sale. In the Michael Jackson probate case, Branca produced Jackson's final will and testament, which designated Branca as executor. The Jackson family filed a preemptive probate action in the Los Angeles Superior Court, based on the allegation that Jackson died \\"intestate,\\" without a valid will. Branca filed the will in Los Angeles on July 1, 2009 and was appointed co-executor. After initially contesting the appointment of Branca and John McClain as executors of Michael's will, his mother Katherine withdrew her objections on November 10, 2009. According to the Associated Press, her attorney, Adam Streisand, said Mrs. Jackson felt it was time legal fighting ended and that her actions were in the best interest of Michael's children. In an interview published in December 2010 she was quoted by the Los Angeles Times as saying that Branca and McClain are doing \\"a very good job\\" managing the estate. Projects for the estate that Branca initiated include the concert film Michael Jackson's This Is It, which Branca served as Executive Producer; Cirque Du Soleil's \\"Immortal\\" which toured from 2011 to 2014 and closed as the eighth-highest-grossing tour of all time; a second, permanent \\"Cirque\\" show, Michael Jackson: One at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, which opened in June 2013 and of which he is also a producer; a best- selling Ubisoft video game; a Spike Lee documentary, Bad 25, which Branca also served as Producer; the 2014 #1 hit album Xscape; and the \\"Slave to the Rhythm\\" \\"holographic\\" MJ performance featured at the Billboard Music Awards, the first of its kind. Since Jackson's passing, the Jackson estate has generated $600 million in income, erasing the $500 million debt it maintained at the time Jackson died. In May 2013, the CBS news show 60 Minutes did a segment about the estate and called this turn-around \\"the most remarkable financial and image resurrection in pop culture history.\\" In 2019 follow by the release of Leaving Neverland, focuses on two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who allege they were sexually abused as children by the singer, he and the rest of the estate condemned it as a \\"tabloid character assassination\\". The issues has cause them to filed a $100 million lawsuit against HBO, petitioning a court to compel their arbitrate cooperation regarding the film's broadcast. As Jackson is dead, HBO cannot be sued for defamation. Instead, the estate claimed HBO had violated a 1992 agreement never to disparage Jackson's public image, stipulated in the terms for broadcasting his concert film Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour.. Eventually, he and the estate sued at HBO for violating a non-disparagement clause in a 1992 contract by agreeing to run the documentary. The suit sought to compel HBO to litigate the issue in a public arbitration process and claimed that the estate could be awarded $100 million or more in damages. The suit accused HBO of fabricating lies with a financial motive. HBO did not stop the airing of the documentary on March 3.On September 19, Judge George Wu tentatively denied HBO's motion to dismiss the estate's lawsuit. Branca said HBO has been trying to suppress the other side of the story. \\"I've never seen a media organization fight so hard to keep a secret,\\" Branca said. On the following day, Judge Wu gave a final ruling to deny HBO's motion to dismiss the case, granting the Jackson estate's motion to compel arbitration. On October 21, 2019, HBO filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit seeking appellate review of the District Court’s order granting the Jackson estate's Motion to Compel Arbitration and shortly after applied for a stay of the arbitration proceedings.Gene Maddaus,\\"HBO Appeals Arbitration Order in ‘Leaving Neverland’ Fight\\", Variety, October 21, 2019.

Artist representation For the Rolling Stones' 1989 Steel Wheels tour, Branca crafted a deal which, for the first time, centralized ticket sales, sponsorships, promotions and logistics with a national promoter, rather than numerous local promoters. Today, virtually all major concert tours follow this model. In 1991, Branca put together what's considered rock's first mega-deal, a four-album deal for Aerosmith with Sony, estimated to be worth $50 million. In 2005, Branca brokered a ground-breaking 360 deal between Korn and EMI, which made EMI a partner in all of Korn's operations. EMI earned a stake in all of Korn's touring and merchandise, instead of only handling the band's CDs, which has typically been the record company's role. A few months later, Branca, with his partner David Lande, expanded the circle to include concert promoter Live Nation. The duo has since put together Live Nation 360 deals for Shakira and Nickelback. He serves as co-counsel for Justin Timberlake. Other clients have included Alicia Keys, Berry Gordy, Martin Lawrence, Dick Clark, Dr. Dre, Justin Timberlake and the Backstreet Boys. Among his clients outside the music world: Forbes magazine, Penthouse magazine, Playboy magazine, investor Ron Perelman, MCI and Mike Tyson. In recent years Branca has been involved in the sale of some of the music industry's most prestigious publishing catalogs, including Berry Gordy's Jobete Music, Leiber & Stoller, and the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization. Branca was also involved in the formation and sale of Interscope Records, the sale of Rhino Records, and represented Rick Rubin and his American Recordings label. He also has served as counsel to numerous music industry investors, including Vivendi, Matsushita and Richard Branson. Music publishing In 1985, Branca facilitated one of the most famous music publishing deals in history, the purchase of ATV Music Publishing for Michael Jackson. In 2008, changes in the tax law that allowed songwriters to pay a small capital gains tax instead of a larger income tax prompted Branca to advise some of his clients that this was the perfect time to sell their music publishing catalogs, thereby establishing new precedents in valuation. Ensuing sales included: Kurt Cobain and Nirvana copyrights; Steve Tyler's Aerosmith publishing catalog of 160 songs to Primary Wave Music Publishing for $50 million; Julian Lennon's share of The Beatles' royalties, and the catalog of the legendary song-writing team of Leiber & Stoller to Sony/ATV, which created a new yardstick by which the worth of catalogs was measured. He also sold Berry Gordy's Jobete Music to EMI, which changed the method and standard by which catalogs were valued. In 2009, Branca beat out Wall Street investment banking houses to represent the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization and sold their catalog for an excess of $200 million, despite predictions by the Wall Street Journal and others that the catalog wouldn't fetch more than $150 million. He also represented Sony Corporation of America in the $2.2 Billion acquisition of EMI Music Publishing and EMI and Sony ATV in the sale of the Virgin Music catalogue. In addition, Branca helped songwriters such as Don Henley of The Eagles regain copyrights of their songs, or to help them secure royalties that they've lost, as he did with John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival. These deals prompted Marty Bandier, CEO and chairman of Sony/ATV Music Publishing, to call Branca the \\"number one music publishing lawyer in the country.\\" Personal life At Branca's first wedding, Michael Jackson was Best Man and Rev. Little Richard Penniman served as minister. Branca currently lives in the gated community of Beverly Park in Los Angeles, California. His home has been described as a palatial estate that \\"resembles a vine-covered Italian villa\\" with such celebrities as Rod Stewart, Brian Wilson, Sylvester Stallone, Eddie Murphy and Denzel Washington living nearby.{{cn} He has two sons, John Connor and Dylan Gregory from his second marriage, and a daughter, Jessica, from his first. In March, 2019, Branca married for the third time to model and actress Jenna Hurt, 34, at the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles. Public service Branca helped Buddy Arnold form the Musicians Assistance Program, which later merged with MusiCares, which provides help to members of the music industry who need treatment for drug and alcohol addiction, as well as assistance for other financial, medical and personal crises. He currently serves as Chair Emeritus of Musicares. For his support, the Grammy Foundation honored him with its 2012 Service Award. Additionally, he is on the Board of the Grammy Museum, the Board of Trustees of Occidental College and on the Executive Committee of UCLA's Pauley Pavilion Renovation Campaign Committee, the goal of which is to transform the pavilion into a world-class sports and cultural facility for the university and community. Branca is a member of the Advisory Council for the Barack Obama Scholars Program at Occidental College. Through his work on behalf of Jackson’s Estate Branca has become outspoken advocate of protecting the deceased from defamation. At a June, 2019, UCLA Law School panel titled “Truth Be Told? Documentary Films Today,” Branca stated: “The purpose of the First Amendment is supposedly getting at the truth, but the lack of defamation protection for an individual no longer living isn’t helpful in that regard. If copyright protection is life plus 75 years, there’s no reason a defamation suit shouldn’t be life plus 20, 30 or even 40 years.” Branca is a Distinguished Alumni of Los Angeles City College. He also co-founded Club 42, an integrated youth baseball league honoring Jackie Robinson, a teammate and friend of Branca’s uncle, Ralph, on the Brooklyn Dodgers, and Branca serves as a director of the Jackie Robinson Foundation. In 2020, Branca was named to the Inaugural Board of Advisors for the Dean of the Herb Albert School of Music at UCLA. Hobbies Branca is an ardent baseball card collector, and has many rare cards. He also has a noted collection of Italian antiques, and is an ardent basketball and music fan.

The film tells the story of an upright Christian police officer investigating the disappearance of a young girl, the search for whom leads him to a remote Scottish isle inhabited by pagans. While staying at the Green Man Pub, Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) is roused from prayer by the landlord's daughter Willow, played by Britt Ekland, who sings the erotic ballad through the adjoining wall of their separate bedrooms while completely naked. The song is an attempt to seduce Howie by accentuating Willow's sensuality. The music is played by the band Magnet. According to the film's associate musical director Gary Carpenter, the screen version was sung by Rachel VerneyGary Carpenter (2000), The Wicker Man: Settling the Score (although some have believed that it was sung by the Scottish jazz singer Annie Ross). There are two different album versions of The Wicker Man soundtrack. The 1998 version released by Trunk Records features the film version of the song. The 2002 version released by Silva Screen features an alternate recording in which Lesley Mackie (who played Daisy in the film) sang to the same backing tracks.An interview with Lesley Mackie, www.wicker- man.com, 2006 According to Paul Giovanni, \\"The idea for the song was completely original with me—there was no indication of what it was to be in the script except a couple of lines of absolute filth,\\" sourced by screenwriter Anthony Shaffer from various anthologies of lyrics that would be appropriate to spring pagan festivals. \\"The main thing is in the rhythm, and we used all of the old twangy instruments in there\\".David Bartholomew (1977), The Wicker Man, Cinefantastique vol 7, no 3 One couplet in the song is adapted from a poem by George Peele, part of his play The Old Wives' Tale (printed 1595).George Peele, The Old Wives' Tale, Sc. 12: \\"Fair maiden, white and red / Comb me smooth and stroke my head\\". Another may be taken from a verse of the Elizabethan-period drinking song \\"Martin Said To His Man\\" (or may since have been added to it).The verse is not included in Thomas Ravenscroft's Deuteromelia (1609); but does appear on Christopher Hogwood's recording Music from the time of Elizabeth I (1992).

The Sacred Oak is a more- than-500-year-old Chinkapin Oak located in the Oley Valley, Pennsylvania. It sits in a grove of trees just off Friedensburg Road. The legend of the Sacred Oak According to Native-American legend, a beautiful woman, the wife of a powerful chief, became very ill. All the tribe's medicine men were called in; they \\"pow-wowed\\" and administered herbal medicines, to no effect. Slowly, the chief's wife became weaker and sicker. Finally, desperate for a cure, the young chief traveled to the Sacred Oak and there prayed to the Great Spirit for his wife to be saved. Amazingly, when he returned to camp, his wife was well again. Several years went by and the tribe was threatened by a hostile tribe. Once again, the chief traveled to the Sacred Oak and prayed to the Great Spirit, who gave him guidance. The chief gathered blankets and beads and journeyed the camp of the enemy. His gifts were accepted, and before he left, he smoked the pipe of peace with the chief of the other tribe. From then on, the Sacred Oak was looked upon as the shrine tree of the Delaware Indians. They went to the Sacred Oak in times of trouble to pray, and legend has it that help was always given to them. Legend says that the oak also has caused adverse effects to ones who have wronged or disrespected the oak. According to legend, the son of a high Lenape chief once urinated on the oak. Later that same day the ten-year-old disappeared into the woods of Oley never to be found. The Sacred Oak today Today, the Sacred Oak still grows in a forested area just off Friedensburg Road in Oley Township. In the past, people were allowed to visit the tree, but now the land is considered private property and is off limits to visitors due to evidence and sightings of pagan worship ceremonies. This includes numerous spottings of robed individuals near the tree, ritualistic items on the surrounding rocks, and multiple animal carcasses. The land was recently sold to a new owner, who has begun raising money to help preserve the Sacred Oak. In 2007, the leader of the Lenape Nation Council, Chief Gentlemoon led two ceremonies to revitalize the tree. The tree was fertilized and deadwood was trimmed to help the tree continue to grow. The wood is being used for a variety of things, including being made into pens by a local craftsmen and Native-Americans all over the country. The Sacred Oak is currently the biggest tree in Berks County and is on the Pennsylvania Forestry Association's Champion Trees of Pennsylvania website. Elders of the Lenni Lenape tribe have certified the tree has been venerated for 480+ years. The current owner, a horticulturist, places the tree's age at approximately 700 years. Updates on property ownership and availability to the public: The property where this is located is privately owned. Since at least 2009, the Sacred Oak has been open to the public only twice per year.

It is named for General Jesse L. Reno, who died at the Battle of South Mountain in the American Civil War. History Fort Reno began as a temporary camp in July 1874 near the Darlington Agency, which needed protection from an Indian uprising that eventually led to the Red River War. After the conflict ended, the post remained to control and protect the Southern Cheyenne and Southern Arapaho reservation, and Fort Reno was established as a permanent fort on July 15, 1874. Soldiers from Fort Reno also attempted to control Boomer and Sooner activity during the rush to open the Unassigned Lands for settlement. Among the units stationed here were the famed Ninth Cavalry of Buffalo Soldiers. The fort lent its name to the city of El Reno, which still exists, as well as Reno City, which was abandoned before Oklahoma statehood. After Oklahoma statehood in 1907, the post was abandoned on February 24, 1908, but remained as a quartermaster remount depot. During World War II, German and Italian prisoners of war were housed on the grounds; the fort's chapel was built by members of the Afrika Korps. In 1949, the fort was abandoned by the Army and transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which uses it as its Grazinglands Research Laboratory. The laboratory's mission is to develop and deliver improved technologies, management strategies, and strategic and tactical planning tools which help evaluate and manage economic and environmental risks, opportunities, and tradeoffs, for integrated crop, forage, and livestock systems under variable climate, energy and market conditions. The remains of German and Italian prisoners of war, residents of the fort, pioneer settlers, and military personnel are interred in the fort's cemetery. Ben Clark, a frontier scout for George Armstrong Custer and Philip Sheridan, is buried there. The fort is open to the public and has a visitor's center with fort memorabilia and exhibits. Fort Reno was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Land controversy An executive order in 1883 officially identified the area assigned to Fort Reno as in the Cheyenne and Arapaho reserve, \\"setting apart for military purposes exclusively of the tract of land herein described.\\" A presidential proclamation (27 Stat., 1018) signed April 12, 1892 by Benjamin Harrison extinguished all Cheyenne-Arapaho claims to their reserve except for individual allotments, including any claims to Fort Reno For several years the combined Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes have been trying to re-acquire the lands the fort occupied. In 1996, they donated US$107,000 to the Democratic National Committee with a memo titled \\"Fort Reno,\\" and at the same time asked the Clinton administration to get an opinion from the Department of the Interior on their claims. The U.S. Senate investigated them for their actions in 1997 but the tribes refused to appear without a grant of immunity. In 1999 the Interior Department issued an opinion saying that the tribes did have a credible argument that they did not cede the lands that were used by the military. Several attempts have been made by Democratic politicians to aid the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes, most notably Eni Fa'aua'a Hunkin Faleomavaega, Jr. of American Samoa in 1997 and by Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii in 2000. In 2005, Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe, co-sponsored by Senator Tom Coburn, introduced a bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to lease oil and gas resources under the fort to fund preservation of the historic site and buildings. The bill received a committee hearing but no further action. References Further reading * Wright, Murial H.; George H. Shirk; Kenny A. Franks.

The Köping–Uttersberg–Riddarhyttan Railway (Swedish: Köping-Uttersberg- Riddarhyttans Järnväg or KURJ) was a narrow-gauge railway in central Sweden, long. The railway ran northwest from the port city of Köping to several small industry cities such as Uttersberg and Riddarhyttan. The line operated between 1864 and 1968. Construction Gauge incompatibility The railway was built with a gauge of . The railway was planned to be constructed to a gauge of , relatively common in Sweden at the time. When the locomotives and rolling stock were ordered, however, there was an error – possibly confusion between the Swedish fot and the English foot, which differ by about 2.7%, or more likely because Köping–Uttersbergs järnvägsaktiebolag assumed the gauge was measured from the centre of the rail to the centre of the rail. It was only when the rolling stock was delivered that the error was noticed. It was decided that moving one rail outwards on the half-built railway would be cheaper than re-gauging the vehicles. Operation Freight traffic started on the part-opened line in 1864, and in 1866, the full of the Köping-Uttersberg Railway was officially Opened. In 1880 a new line, the Uttersberg-Riddarhyttan Railway was built by another company, but to the same gauge. This was purchased by the Köping-Uttersberg Company in 1911, and the combined railway became the Köping–Uttersberg–Riddarhyttan Railway. Closure Passenger traffic ended in 1952, although a freight service continued until 1968, after which all the track was removed.

Born in Baltimore, Goldsmith moved from the local Enterprise club to the Maryland late in the 1868 season, probably just short of his 20th birthday. Maryland was the strongest team in the city but it lost badly to Enterprise on September 1 (15-36) before winning twice, 17-15 and 33-18, in the middle of the month. Goldsmith evidently won a \\"job\\" in those three matches.In the incomplete record compiled by Wright (2000), Goldsmith played 9 games for Enterprise and 6 for Maryland. Enterprise played 12 games but only 10 with box scores, including one after the third Maryland game. So he left the team before or after its finale with the Cincinnati Red Stockings, September 26. Maryland played at least five games in October with some other dates unknown. Goldsmith was a marginal player in the National Association, able to play at that level only with teams that would not survive. He played all 19 games for Kekionga in 1871, all nine for Olympic in 1872, and all 13 for Western in 1875. In 1873 he played one game for his old Maryland club, which dropped out after playing six games against Baltimore and Washington opposition. Notes References *Retrosheet. \\"Wally Goldsmith\\".

France and British colonists both settled the islands, and for a period of time the British imported indentured Irish servants. The native Caribs, skilled warriors, defended their lands by attacking the colonies. But by 1782, the British had gained control of St. Kitts and Nevis, which they retained until granting the islands their independence in 1983. British influence remains in the country's official language, English, while some islanders speak an English-based Creole. The influence of the French, Irish, and Carib seems less pronounced. The people of St. Kitts and Nevis are devoutly religious. Several historic Anglican churches remain on Nevis, and fifty percent of the country's population still practices the religion. Most other people belong to another Christian denomination, though there are some Rastafarians and a few followers of the Baháʼí Faith. An old Jewish cemetery on Nevis proves that there was once a Jewish population as well, but currently there is no active Jewish community in the country. Festivities As in other Caribbean nations, the culture on St. Kitts and Nevis is festive and vibrant. Carnivals and celebrations play an important role in island life. At Christmas time, Carnival is in full swing on St. Kitts. The opening gala takes place in mid-December, with events going on until a few days after New Year's. Among these events, crowd favorites include the Miss Caribbean Talented Teen Pageant, the Junior Calypso Show, and the National Carnival Queen Pageant. Of course, there are also plenty of parades full of people wearing colorful, spangled costumes. Another very popular aspect of Carnival, Masquerade (or Mas) evolved over the past three centuries from a mix of African and European traditions. Masquerade performers wear brightly patterned long-sleeved shirts with trousers, all embellished with bangles, mirrors, and ribbons. Topping off their costumes are masks and headdresses decorated with peacock feathers. Their dances combine elements of waltzes, jigs, wild mas, fertility dances, quadrilles, and other traditional African and European dances. Stilt-walkers called Moko-Jumbies wear similar but simpler costumes. The word \\"Moko\\" may come from the name for a vengeance god in West Africa, where the tradition originated. Or it may derive from the Macaw tree, a tall palm with thorns - headdresses worn by the Moko-Jumbies are said to be patterned after a Macaw in bloom. Wearing stilts six to eight feet high, Moko-Jumbies dance to entertain the crowds. Clown troupes also perform at this time of year. In groups of about fifty, they dance while a live band plays music. Bells on their baggy, vivid costumes jingle as they move. Pink masks meant to represent Europeans cover their faces. Apart from Carnival, the island of Nevis has its own unique festival, Culturama. Celebrated on the weekend of Emancipation Day, it began in 1974 when some islanders feared that their native folk art and customs were being lost. They started Culturama to reconnect people with their traditional culture. In addition to arts and crafts, the five-day-long celebration includes dances, music, drama, and religious sacrifices. Parties, boat rides, swimsuit contests, and street jams have also become part of the festivities. Music The music of Saint Kitts and Nevis is known for a number of musical celebrations including Carnival (December 17 to January 3 on Saint Kitts). The last week in June features the St Kitts Music Festival, while the week-long Culturama on Nevis lasts from the end of July into early August.Cameron, pg. 502 There are also other festivals on the island of Saint Kitts. These celebrations typically feature parades, street dances and salsa, jazz, soca, calypso and steelpan music. Cuisine With its rich soil, St. Kitts and Nevis grow a wide variety of fresh produce. Abundant seafood and meats such as goat add to the diet. The style of cooking is fairly simple, flavored much like other West Indian cuisine. Goat water stew, perhaps the country's most well-known dish, mixes goat, breadfruit, green pawpaw (papaya), and dumplings (also known as \\"droppers\\") in a tomato- based stew. Another favorite dish is cook-up, or pelau, which combines chicken, pig tail, saltfish and vegetables with rice and pigeon peas. Conkies bear a large similarity to tamales, though instead of having filling rolled inside the dough, the cornmeal is mixed together with grated sweet potato, pumpkin, coconut, and a few other ingredients; after wrapping the dough in banana leaves, they're boiled rather than steamed. Sweets tend to be simply made, sometimes with nothing more than fruit, like tamarind or guava, and sugar. Rum is as popular on St. Kitts and Nevis as it is throughout the Caribbean. The Brinley Gold Company manufactures rum on St. Kitts, with such distinctive flavors as coffee, mango, and vanilla. But the national drink is actually Cane Spirits Rothschild (often abbreviated to CSR), distilled from fresh sugar cane. Belmont Estate and St. Kitts Rum also make rum on the island. In addition several of the beach bars will provide moonshine rum produced by individuals with homemade stills. Many villages on Nevis hold cookouts on Friday and Saturday nights, where people come together to eat, drink, play games like dominoes, and have a good time. Arts and crafts Artists of St. Kitts and Nevis create works inspired by their own native traditions, life on the islands, and African roots. Pottery is especially notable, both red clay pieces and pieces fired with colorful glazes and indigenous designs. Paintings often depict tropical landscapes, portraits of islanders, or cultural traditions like clowns performing. Other crafts include rug weaving, wooden items such as carvings, batiks and sculptures, and leather work. Sports and games Hearkening back to its days as a British colony, the country's most loved sport is cricket. Local, regional, and even international matches are played. Horse racing is also popular, particularly on Nevis. The monthly races are festive events, with music and barbecue adding to the fun spirit. Mountain biking, golf, and soccer are other pastimes. St. Kitts also hosts an annual triathlon, which has become increasingly popular since its inception seven years ago. There is also an annual swim across the channel between St. Kitts and Nevis. A local hash association exists as well, with hashes occurring roughly every third Saturday. Kim Collins, the 2002 Commonwealth and 2003 World Championship 100m winner, is from St. Kitts and Nevis.

Its function were to provide a measurement infrastructure which supports innovation, facilitates fair competition, promotes international trade and protects consumers and the environment. History The agency was created as National Weights and Measures Laboratory (NWML) in 1987 from a reorganisation of the Standards Department when it moved from its previous location in central London to a new, purpose-built facility in Teddington which was officially opened by the Duke of Kent on the 9th of April 1987. Until June 28, 2007 it was an agency of the Department of Trade and Industry. It then became part of the newly formed Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. In 2009 an agency moved to Department for Business Innovation and Skills and until April 2015 was known as the National Measurement Office (NMO). In April 2015 NMO was renamed to National Measurement and Regulation Office and by 1 April 2016 it was merged with Better Regulation Delivery Office to form Regulatory Delivery in the former Department for Business Innovation and Skills. Since July 2017, Regulatory Delivery has been a directorate in the newly created Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Roles The NMO and NMRO was responsible for the setting of the strategic direction of the measurement infrastructure, aligning policy and legislation, managing the national scientific and legal metrological activities and representing the UK in international activities on measurement. In addition, the NMO / NMRO acts as a National Enforcement Authority for a range of EU- based environmental legislation and carries out commercial activities which rely on measurement expertise. Scientific metrology The Agency had responsibility for the National Measurement System (NMS) until April 2015, which is the UK's national infrastructure of laboratories that are involved with the science and technology of measurement. It has responsibility for maintaining the national primary standards (mass, length, time, temperature etc.) and disseminating the associated measurements and technologies to the UK for trade and measurement purposes. Legal metrology The Agency was also responsible for examining and approving new measuring instruments and equipment which are ultimately intended for use in trade in order to establish their compliance with national legislation such as the Weights and Measures Act 1985 and relevant EU legislation. The agency also made available to manufacturers of such equipment a consultancy service, intended to be used throughout different stages of the equipment's development. They also provided calibration and testing services to both local authorities and private businesses, as well as training in aspects of legal metrology to national and international clients.

In the view of the anti-Thaksin camp (related to the Democratic Party), Thaksinocracy is a portmanteau of the terms \\"Thaksin\\" and \\"democracy\\". According to Thaksin critics, Thaksinocracy has the following characteristics: # Electoral democracy and \\"policy corruption\\" # Cronyism and nepotism # A double standard and biased judiciary # Populism # Conflicts of interests # Tax evasion Thaksin supporters, of course see all of this as pure political demagogy, where opposing parties make baseless accusations while engaging in similar practices themselves (it was the judiciary, for example, that removed a Thaksin-related government in 2008, in what came to be known as a \\"judicial coup\\"). Tax evasion has been used by Thaksin detractors following Thaksin's sale of his company that was legally free of tax by virtue of laws that were in force long before Thaksin came to power. Thaksin detractors claimed that even if the tax exemption was legal, not paying the tax was immoral. The term \\"Thaksinocracy\\" is used to describe Thaksin's government which, by opponents, was alleged to be full of conflicts of interests, double standards, biases, and corruption. For the people who support Thaksin Shinawatra, the term \\"Thaksinocracy\\" is an insult. They believe that the people who are using it are only \\"jealous\\" of the electoral successes of Thaksin compared to his predecessors. For example, in the case of Abhisit Vejjajiva, the leader of Democratic Party who used this term often, Thaksin supporters always tease him with the word \\"rabob Abhisit\\" or \\"system of privilege\\" ( noun privilege; monopoly; exclusive right.) They point out that Abhisit's Democrat Party has not won an election in 20 years. However, for the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), the meaning of rabob Thaksin or Thaksinocracy has a much more complicated meaning and content rather than just an insult word to Thaksin. The PAD and their partners, the Democrat Party, aim to replace Thaksinocracy with a system whereby government leaders are appointed by a select group of \\"good\\" people. One of the PAD's goals when it was formed was to eliminate Thaksinocracy in Thailand.

Lowe Jr. grew up in Dallas and attended Highland Park High School. He graduated magna cum laude from Rice University in Electrical Engineering and served two years in the U.S. Navy before joining TDIndustries in 1964. TDIndustries has been recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of the Best Places to Work repeatedly because of the company's use of the servant-leadership model. Lowe Jr. furthered his father's legacy at TDIndustries and in the broader business community as a whole. TDIndustries By 1965, Lowe was low man in the Wholesale Division, and someone had pointed him in the direction of the fledgling apartment industry. He was selling cable heating for residences and a new unitary heating and cooling system for the new large apartment complexes. By the time TD brought GE’s new and better equipment into the Dallas market, unitary systems were considered a bad risk. The Lincoln Properties’ Willow Creek complex went with TD’s system, opening the apartment market to GE units. Lincoln Properties ran a subsidiary called RCLP—Rockefeller, Crow, Lyle and Pogue—that did all of its mechanical work. Trammell wanted TD to take over all of the air conditioning, plumbing, and electrical in their apartment business. TD agreed to the air conditioning and later plumbing. The plumbers, heat and air crews formed a separate company in 1967 that would function as a franchised Texas Distributors dealer and was named Tempo Air Conditioning, Inc. Trouble arose almost immediately, and it reflected on Lowe, who was the Wholesale Division’s liaison with Tempo—the man in charge of Tempo had been diverting men and materials to his own projects, and Lowe didn’t catch him at it. It was a big trauma to him and a growing experience. By 1971, Lowe was General Manager of Texas Distributors, and in 1976, he became General Manager for TDMechanical. In 1978, Tempo was taken in as a full-fledged division of Texas Distributors. It grew and soon joined TDMechanical as TDIndustries’ largest earners. Lowe was promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer in 1979, and after the passing of his father in 1980, he became CEO. Lowe Jr. served as CEO from 1980 to 2005, and continues to serve as chairman of the board for TDIndustries. He was succeeded by Harold MacDowell. Community involvement In his career, Lowe has been active in many civic and industry organizations, including serving on the boards of the Dallas Citizens Council, Salesmanship Club of Dallas, United Way of Metropolitan Dallas, Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan Dallas, Dallas Zoological Society, the advisory council of the Communities Foundation of Texas, Quality Texas Foundation, Texas Business and Education Coalition, and the Senior Citizens of Greater Dallas. He is also currently Chairman of the Board of the Dallas chapter of QUOIN, Associated General Contractors. His past community service includes serving on the boards of the Dallas Chapter of the American Red Cross, Center for Non Profit Management, Cotton Bowl Athletic Association, Dallas County Community College District Foundation, Greater Dallas Chamber of Commerce, and Construction Education Foundation. He is the past president of the Salesmanship Club of Dallas, Dallas Alliance, and the Community Council of Greater Dallas. In 2002, Lowe began serving on the Board of Trustees of the Dallas Independent School District, and in May 2006, became president of the board. He has been a director of the Zales corporation since 2004, a director of Drew Industries since 2005, and has been the Business Co-chair of the Texas Business and Education Coalition and on the board of the Center for the Reform of School Systems since 2000. He continues to chair the board of the Greenleaf Center for Servant Leadership. Achievements Among his many awards and honors are the Crystal Achievement Award from the National Association of Women in Construction, the Ethics Award from the Preston Center Rotary Club, the SIR (Service, Integrity, Responsibility) Award from the Associated General Contractors, Dallas Chapter, and the Alumni Award from Leadership Dallas. He also received the national 2000 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award for Principle-centered Leadership, presented by Stephen Covey of the Franklin Covey Co. in Palm Springs, California . The award recognized Lowe’s lifetime achievement as an entrepreneur and leader and honored him for his role in building an empowered culture at TDIndustries that epitomizes the philosophy of leader as servant. In 2005 Jack received the J. Erik Jonsson Ethics Award from the Maguire Center for Ethics and Public Responsibility at Southern Methodist University, and in 2007, was named a Distinguished Alumnus of his high school, Highland Park, in Dallas, Texas.

It was written by lead vocalist and bassist Sting. An alternate version was released as a single in the UK in 1980 in the set Six Pack in conjunction with the re-release of the Police's earlier singles \\"Roxanne\\", \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\", \\"So Lonely\\", \\"Message in a Bottle\\" and \\"Walking on the Moon\\". It has been covered by a number of other artists, including Sting as a solo artist, Ranking Roger and Sheila Hylton. Background The themes of the song are loneliness and the pain of the end of a relationship. The lyrics were inspired by an incident in which Sting's first girlfriend, after being heartbroken upon their break-up, committed suicide. \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\" was first released on Reggatta de Blanc in 1979. However, the following year, the song saw a single release as a bonus single in the Six Pack box set, which featured the band's five previous British singles (excluding \\"Fall Out\\"). Said box set peaked at No. 17 in Britain. The song was also released as the B-side to \\"So Lonely\\" in Germany. A promo video for \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\" was performed by the band on The Kenny Everett Video Show. It featured the band members miming to the song in a suburban house. \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\" was included on a number of Police compilation and live albums. The original album version was included on Greatest Hits and the UK deluxe version of The Police, while the alternate mono version was included on Message in a Box: The Complete Recordings. A live version is included on Live!. Reception AllMusic critic Chris True regards \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\" as a classic example of the Police's ability to merge reggae with new wave music. He also praises the musicianship of all three members of the band, Stewart Copeland's \\"brilliant\\" drumming, Andy Summers' \\"trebly\\" guitar playing and Sting's \\"rolling\\" bass line. He notes that the song never gets boring, even when only the drums and bass are playing. Authors Chris Welch and Ken Micallef and Donnie Marshall also praise Copeland's drumming, particularly on the snare drum. Micallef and Marshall specifically describe Copeland's snare drum rhythms as \\"ricocheting\\" and \\"dub- heavy\\". Welch regards \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\" as the third great hit from Reggatta de Blanc, along with \\"Message in a Bottle\\" and \\"Walking on the Moon\\", particularly praising the fact that it is \\"a simple phrase, a neat concept\\". Welch also praises the alternate version, which appears on the box set Message in a Box, for having an even \\"more direct impact\\". AllMusic critic Greg Prato considers it an \\"early fave\\" of the Police. Mojo critic John Harris regards the song as \\"stereotypically Police-esque\\" to the point of appearing to be a self-parody. Rolling Stone critic Debra Rae Cohen described it as \\"an evocative reggae track\\", particularly praising Sting's vocals and Summers' guitar. While NME critic Tony Stewart considered it to be \\"a lame expression of remorse\\", author Martin Charles Strong describes it as a \\"melodic lament\\" and an example of the Police \\"charting new musical territory\\".

Early years and education Castle Coole, Co. Fermanagh Lord Belmore, who was born into a famous Anglo-Irish aristocratic family, was educated first at Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, at the school's preparatory department, and then at his father's alma mater Lancing College, followed by two years at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester. He had succeeded his father in the earldom at the age of 9, and, following his education, he returned home to the family seat at Castle Coole to help manage the house and estate, which had been transferred to the care of the National Trust in 1951. Castle Coole Lord Belmore developed a good relationship with the trust and has spent the past two decades adding to the collection of art at Castle Coole. He commissioned Enniskillen-born artist T.P. Flanagan to produce a series of watercolours and oils of the house. His most important acquisition was a painting of the ‘heavenly twins’ Castor and Pollux by Giovanni Battista Cipriani. Dated 1783, it was one of three paintings commissioned for Houghton Hall in Norfolk and was purchased by Lord Belmore in 1990. The painting is so large that it had to be brought into the house through the Breakfast Room window and without its frame. Another important purchase was ‘The Leslie Conversation Piece’ by J.H. Mortimer, which had previously been at Castle Leslie in Glaslough, a village in the north-east corner of County Monaghan. Painted by Mortimer in 1770, the picture portrays some of the most colourful and prosperous landowners of the day, including Lord Mornington, who was ennobled by the King for his music making and is seen in the picture entertaining the company at the piano. The painting now hangs in the State Bedroom which the 2nd Earl had decorated in a lavish style for a planned visit by King George IV, who never came, preferring to dally with his mistress Lady Conyngham at Slane Castle instead.Culture Northern Ireland Lord Belmore: Connoisseur, Collector of Art 11 April 2011 Lord Belmore was also on the board of the National Gallery of Ireland for five years, including a period as vice chairman.

The first Khazarig was, according to Sandilch, a son of Ernakh, after whom the Kozarigur Bulgar-Huns were named. Ernakh's other son was Utig after whom Sandilch's own Utigur Bulgar-Huns were named. Perhaps unrelated, Kozar, the name of a Khazar ancestor in the Khazar correspondence, could mean \\"Goat-Herder\\" in Slavonic languages. Bar Hebraeus According to Bar Hebraeus and the Chronicle of Michael the Syrian, the name Kazarig was later adopted by one of three brothers (the others being Bulgarios and Drogo) who came from the Imaon mountains to rule Hunnish tribes in the East European grasslands in 583. Kotzarig's subjects became known as Khazars. His brother Bulgarios with 10,000 men acquired Dacia from Emperor Maurice (emperor) (582-602). The fate of the third brother is not mentioned. There is a frequently drawn parallel between these three brothers and the three brothers Shchek, Khoryv (Carpathia) and Kyi (who founded Kyiv in the 6th century) to whom the Khazars are said to be related. Interpretation The first Kazarig was the son of Ernakh whose Onogurs relocated in 463 seizing the lands of the Akatziroi after whom he named his son Kazarig. The report of Bar Hebraeus then refers mainly to events during Zabergan's rule of the Kutrigurs immediately following Sinnion and the dominance of the Avar conqueror Kandik. The Eurasian Avars arrived in 557. Tiberius II Constantine was acting for Justin at the time. The acquisition of Dacia was not immediate but was part of Maurice's Balkan campaigns where Zabergan was recruited into Empire service. Bulgarios should be identified with Sandilch and Kazarig with Zabergan taking their names from the tribes they ruled in the Sarmatian Steppe. Legacy The name is later given by Nikephoros I of Constantinople to one of the \\"sons\\" of Khagan Kubrat who, following a dispute with his brother Batbayan, established his rule in Bolghar.

He is the son of CIA official Frank Wisner (1909–1965). On January 31, 2011, he was sent to Egypt by President Barack Obama to negotiate a resolution to the popular protests against the regime that had swept the country. A White House spokesman said that Wisner had vast experience in the region as well as close relationships with many Egyptians in and out of government. The New York Times reports that he is a personal friend of former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. He works as an international-affairs advisor at the firm of Squire Patton Boggs in Washington, DC. Life and career Wisner was born in New York on July 2, 1938. He joined the State Department as a Foreign Service Officer in December 1961. In 1976, at the beginning of the Carter administration, he served under Cyrus Vance as Deputy Executive Secretary of the Department of State. Among his overseas assignments, Wisner served as the United States Ambassador to Zambia (1979–82); Egypt (1986–91), the Philippines (1991–92), and India, 1994–97. During his tenure in Lusaka he played the role of point man for the Constructive Engagement policy of assistant secretary of state for African affairs Chester Crocker. Wisner worked well with Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda and helped to rebuild bilateral relations between Zambia and the USA after a 1980 spy scandal at the U.S. embassy in Lusaka. Crocker's efforts contributed to the organization and successful discussions at the February 1984 Lusaka Conference regarding conflicts in Angola and Namibia.Andy DeRoche, Kenneth Kaunda, the United States and Southern Africa (London: Bloomsbury, 2016), 150-151, 168-170, and 192-196. After retiring from government service in 1997, Wisner joined the board at a subsidiary of Enron, the former energy company and served on the board of American International Group (AIG). In late 2002, Wisner co-chaired an independent working group which developed a model for the US's post- conflict role in Iraq, should an invasion occur. Their published recommendations included: establishment of law and order through the retraining of the Iraqi army, focusing on the distribution of humanitarian assistance and reestablishment of vital services, and the importance of avoiding the appointment of exiled Iraqi opposition leaders to dominant positions in the new government. Wisner is an advisory board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. In 2012 he succeeded Paul A. Volcker as chairman of the board of trustees of International House, a cultural-exchange residence and program center in New York City. He also serves on the advisory board of the National Security Network, and on the board of Refugees International. He went on to become a member of the board for EOG Resources. In June 2013, Wisner joined the advisory board of Ergo, a global intelligence and advisory firm. Wisner is Chair of the Board of The Arab Gulf States Institute. 2011 Egypt protests In early 2011, the Obama administration asked Wisner to carry views to Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak, including advice that Mubarak should resign to defuse the crisis. Wisner was unsuccessful in convincing Mubarak to do so. Four days later, after a day in which Mubarak allies took violent reprisal against democracy activists, Wisner spoke to a security conference in Europe and called it \\"crucial\\" that Mubarak stay on in the interest of \\"stability\\".

A localization of the original Unite Ad States channel, it launched in 2001 and primarily carried classic Warner Bros. and Hanna-Barbera cartoons up until 2006, when it relaunched as a youth- oriented service. The network would relaunch once more in 2008, now focusing exclusively on teenagers, before becoming the first Boomerang feed in the world to undergo the 2014-15 worldwide rebrand on 28 September 2014. History 2001–06 The channel was launched on 2 July 2001 with the same graphics and programming from the US variant of the channel. It used to air classic Hanna-Barbera cartoons that had been dropped from the Latin American variant of Cartoon Network back then. As general children's service (2006–07) On 3 April 2006, Boomerang was relaunched as a general children's entertainment network, introducing a logo and on-air branding style identical to that of Pogo (a Turner-owned kids channel in India). Classic cartoons were pushed to the overnight and early morning hours, while the daytime lineup began to feature live-action and animated series; this also encompassed a variation of the Tiny TV block, Mini TV. As teen-oriented channel (2008–14) In January 2008, (June 2008 in Latin America) in the Brazilian and Mexican localised feeds, the channel modified its logo and reluanched again, now solely broadcasting original and third-party-produced shows aimed at teenagers. All classical animation was moved over to Tooncast, a separate 24-hour channel which launched in December of that year. The channel aired some successful blocks, such as Boombox, which consisted of interviews to different artists and featuring live concerts in Latin America, the US and later, the United Kingdom. On 1 April 2009, the channel launched a mobile service.http://www.realtvnews.com.ar/new/noticias.php?id=4400 Outside of Latin America, the channel is an associate member of the Caribbean Cable Cooperative.Member channels of the Caribbean Cable Cooperative By mid-2010, the channel's logo was slightly modified.http://boomerangla.com By May 2011, it was the only Boomerang channel in the world that didn't air any animated content.

A contribution claim asserts the party (usually a defendant) is entitled to \\"contribution\\" from a third party for any money damages awarded to the plaintiff. For example, if a plaintiff sues a homeowner for damages caused by a garage door, the defendant homeowner could add a third party, the manufacturer of the garage door to contribute to any damages awarded to the plaintiff according to the proportionate share of responsibility, liability, or fault assigned to the homeowner and the manufacturer by the jury. In most cases, contribution claims are brought like the original lawsuit itself. The claim must be personally served on the new, third party defendant, by the third party plaintiff (the defendant bringing the claim for contribution relief). In contrast, a counter-claim asserts that the party (usually a defendant) is entitled to offset the damages awarded to plaintiff by the proportionate share of any responsibility, liability, or fault assigned to the plaintiff by the jury. Finally, a cross-claim is the same as a counter-claim or contribution claim, except that it is asserted by a defendant against other defendants. Counter-claims and cross claims do not require personal service because no new parties are being added to the lawsuit. In some state court systems, a contribution claim must be opened as a new case, and thus the defendant must pay for a filing fee, docket number, or index number. In other states, however, no additional fee is required.

The first game Space I was originally designed by Steven Pederson and Sherwin Steffin of Edu-Ware Services, and then expanded upon in the sequel Space II by David Mullich, both released in 1979. These games were notable for not only being one of the first science fiction RPGs to appear on personal computers, but also for providing a level of realism not found in other games of the time. The game system was based upon the Traveller role-playing-game, created by Game Designers Workshop, which sued Edu-Ware for copyright infringement in 1982. In an out-of-court settlement, both Space and Space II were removed from the market. Synopsis Players begin by creating characters to play in a futuristic interstellar society and then enrolling them in one of the military services: Navy, Army, Scouts, Merchant Marines, and other Services. While in the service, players choose their character's training, provided they qualify for it. Depending upon characters' physical and mental abilities, they may learn such skills as brawling, bribery, swordsmanship, computers, interstellar navigation, spaceship piloting, and so on. Through training and study, characters can also increase their base physical and mental abilities. Characters have a choice to leave the service after every four years of enlistment, provided that they have not been killed or suffered serious injury. After retiring from the service, characters can engage in one of the scenarios that are included with each version of the game. Scenarios can increase a character's wealth or grant possessions, but with the exception of the Psychodelia scenario in Space II, they cannot voluntarily alter a character's abilities. However, most character traits degrade over time as the character ages during gameplay. If a character dies during any of the scenarios, the text file defining the character is immediately erased from the game disk. Games Space I Steve Pederson programmed the first game of the series, which features the following scenarios: * Explore: Characters decide which of several planets to explore, searching for food and minerals to sell back to the Federation. * First Blood: Characters engage in combat with an adversary controlled by the computer. After a fight to the death, winning characters collect all the wealth of the losing character. * Trader: Characters owning starships earn money by transport passengers and cargo. * Defend: As an administrator of a planet far away from Earth, characters must defend colonists from an alien invasion. * High Finance: Wealthy characters participate in the galactic stock market. Space II Later that year game developer David Mullich created Space II, an expansion pack for the role- playing game, his first game for Edu-Ware. It consists of the character creation module and two additional game scenarios: * Shaman: Characters launch their career as a religious practitioner who is tasked with building a cult on a new world, using an all-terrain vehicle to travel across the planet and accumulate followers. * Psychodelia: Characters experiment with mind-altering drugs, which may boost or retard various traits, which is the only way they can be altered once a character leaves military service. Development Space was conceived by Pederson and Steffin while the former was still attending college at UCLA. The two used the game concept to convince Rainbow Computing, a computer store that sold Edu-Ware games through its mail order catalog, to provide Pederson with an Apple II in exchange for receiving product at cost. When Pederson and Steffin learned that Rainbow had announced Space in its catalog before the game was completed, the two spent twenty-four straight hours debugging the game without the benefit of Edu-Ware even owning a printer at the time. Mullich wrote the sequel, Space II, as an exercise in risk- benefit analysis, as the player's character is presented with dangerous options throughout the game, and the player must determine whether the potential rewards are worth the possible risks. Reception Both games were well-received critically, earning an \\"A-\\" rating in a 1980 Peelings II review. Bruce Webster reviewed Space and Space II in The Space Gamer No. 31. Webster commented that \\"I'm afraid I can't recommend these games in their current condition, at least not at their price. If you've got money and time to burn, though, you might get them and rewrite them yourselves - but do so at your own risk.\\" Lawsuit In 1982 Game Designers Workshop successfully sued Edu-Ware for copyright infringement of their Traveller pen-and-paper role-playing game. In an out of court settlement, EduWare suspended publication of Space and Space II, but the company had already replaced both games with the Empire space trilogy, based on an original role-playing game system.

He was educated at Princeton College and Columbia College, from which he graduated in 1806. Chrystie was commissioned as a first lieutenant in May 1808. In March 1812 (at the age of 24), he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the 13th U.S. Infantry.Historical Register & Dictionary of the US Army At Queenston Heights, he was to command the regular contingent in the initial crossing of the Niagara River from New York State into Ontario. He crossed over the Canadian side of the river once a secure foothold had been established, but his boat crew panicked and returned to the American side of the river, and was absent when the U.S. troops who had crossed were cut off and forced to surrender. He was blamed for the American defeat by Colonel Solomon Van Rensselaer and other officers. Chrystie was accused of cowardice after the incident.

Biography Delaney's father was a pioneer in motorsport, having competed in the 1903 Paris-Madrid road race, and in 1910, having become the agent for the French manufacturer Delaunay Belleville he built a factory in Maida Vale, north London. After World War I he became managing director of Lea Francis, and in 1928 the young Tom accompanied the team's cars to Brooklands for testing and tuning in preparation for the first ever Ards Tourist Trophy race in Ireland. Tom later joined the team in Ireland as a young pit manager and was thrilled to witness Kaye Don winning the TT in the Lea Francis, a car which Tom then acquired. In 1930, Delaney he won two trophies in his first year of competition, and quite a number thereafter, at venues such as Brooklands (he later became Vice-President of the Brooklands Society), Brighton Speed Trials, Shelsley Walsh, Chalfont, Prescott and Phoenix Park (leading the Irish GP for most of the way). He raced at many well-known circuits including Donington (he competed both in the inaugural meeting in 1933 and in 2005!), Castle Combe, Rockingham, Goodwood and Silverstone. Apart from motor cars and aeroplanes (he was one of the first men to gain a pilot's licence at Brooklands), Delaney took over and greatly expanded his father's business, Delaney Gallay Ltd. They had five factories and employed 2,000 people. They were heat exchange engineers who supplied advanced heating and cooling systems for both aircraft and vehicles. They were the first to introduce car heaters, air-conditioning and seat belts for cars in the UK. Delaney Gallay components flew on Spitfires, Lancasters, Typhoons and many modern civil and military aircraft, including Concorde. The company Gallay still operates, and is based in Wellingborough. It is now part of the G&M; Group. In 2004, Delaney suffered a serious accident while racing at Silverstone where he was thrown out of his car, which then bounced off a barrier running him over. In hospital that evening he was told he had only injured his wrist, whereupon Delaney telephoned his mechanic to see if the car could be repaired for the next race. In late 2005, Delaney received the Motor Sports Association's first ever \\"Lifetime Achievement\\" award to mark his 75 years of motor racing. His last race, at the age of 95, came at a VSCC meeting at Silverstone in April 2006; he had been invited to the Goodwood Revival meeting in early September, but died, after a short illness, just a few days before it was held. Tom Delaney was featured in the BBC ONE Life documentary The Oldest Drivers in Britain, which was broadcast on BBC1 on 18 October 2006.

Point-in-time consistency Point-in-time consistency is an important property of backup files and a critical objective of software that creates backups. It is also relevant to the design of disk memory systems, specifically relating to what happens when they are unexpectedly shut down. As a relevant backup example, consider a website with a database such as the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, which needs to be operational around the clock, but also must be backed up with regularity to protect against disaster. Portions of Wikipedia are constantly being updated every minute of every day, meanwhile, Wikipedia's database is stored on servers in the form of one or several very large files which require minutes or hours to back up. These large files - as with any database - contain numerous data structures which reference each other by location. For example, some structures are indexes which permit the database subsystem to quickly find search results. If the data structures cease to reference each other properly, then the database can be said to be corrupted. Counter example The importance of point-in-time consistency can be illustrated with what would happen if a backup were made without it. Assume Wikipedia's database is a huge file, which has an important index located 20% of the way through, and saves article data at the 75% mark. Consider a scenario where an editor comes and creates a new article at the same time a backup is being performed, which is being made as a simple \\"file copy\\" which copies from the beginning to the end of the large file(s) and doesn't consider data consistency - and at the time of the article edit, it is 50% complete. The new article is added to the article space (at the 75% mark) and a corresponding index entry is added (at the 20% mark). Because the backup is already halfway done and the index already copied, the backup will be written with the article data present, but with the index reference missing. As a result of the inconsistency, this file is considered corrupted. In real life, a real database such as Wikipedia's may be edited thousands of times per hour, and references are virtually always spread throughout the file and can number into the millions, billions, or more. A sequential \\"copy\\" backup would literally contain so many small corruptions that the backup would be completely unusable without a lengthy repair process which could provide no guarantee as to the completeness of what has been recovered. A backup process which properly accounts for data consistency ensures that the backup is a snapshot of how the entire database looked at a single moment. In the given Wikipedia example, it would ensure that the backup was written without the added article at the 75% mark, so that the article data would be consistent with the index data previously written. Disk caching systems Point-in- time consistency is also relevant to computer disk subsystems. Specifically, operating systems and file systems are designed with the expectation that the computer system they are running on could lose power, crash, fail, or otherwise cease operating at any time. When properly designed, they ensure that data will not be unrecoverably corrupted if the power is lost. Operating systems and file systems do this by ensuring that data is written to a hard disk in a certain order, and rely on that in order to detect and recover from unexpected shutdowns. On the other hand, rigorously writing data to disk in the order that maximizes data integrity also impacts performance. A process of write caching is used to consolidate and re-sequence write operations such that they can be done faster by minimizing the time spent moving disk heads. Data consistency concerns arise when write caching changes the sequence in which writes are carried out, because it there exists the possibility of an unexpected shutdown that violates the operating system's expectation that all writes will be committed sequentially. For example, in order to save a typical document or picture file, an operating system might write the following records to a disk in the following order: # Journal entry saying file XYZ is about to be saved into sector 123. # The actual contents of the file XYZ are written into sector 123. # Sector 123 is now flagged as occupied in the record of free/used space. # Journal entry noting the file completely saved, and its name is XYZ and is located in sector 123. The operating system relies on the assumption that if it sees item #1 is present (saying the file is about to be saved), but that item #4 is missing (confirming success), that the save operation was unsuccessful and so it should undo any incomplete steps already taken to save it (e.g. marking sector 123 free since it never was properly filled, and removing any record of XYZ from the file directory). It relies on these items being committed to disk in sequential order. Suppose a caching algorithm determines it would be fastest to write these items to disk in the order 4-3-1-2, and starts doing so, but the power gets shut down after 4 get written, before 3, 1 and 2, and so those writes never occur. When the computer is turned back on, the file system would then show it contains a file named XYZ which is located in sector 123, but this sector really does not contain the file. (Instead, the sector will contain garbage, or zeroes, or a random portion of some old file - and that is what will show if the file is opened). Further, the file system's free space map will not contain any entry showing that sector 123 is occupied, so later, it will likely assign that sector to the next file to be saved, believing it is available. The file system will then have two files both unexpectedly claiming the same sector (known as a cross-linked file). As a result, a write to one of the files will overwrite part of the other file, invisibly damaging it. A disk caching subsystem that ensures point-in-time consistency guarantees that in the event of an unexpected shutdown, the four elements would be written one of only five possible ways: completely (1-2-3-4), partially (1, 1-2, 1-2-3), or not at all. High-end hardware disk controllers of the type found in servers include a small battery back-up unit on their cache memory so that they may offer the performance gains of write caching while mitigating the risk of unintended shutdowns. The battery back-up unit keeps the memory powered even during a shutdown so that when the computer is powered back up, it can quickly complete any writes it has previously committed. With such a controller, the operating system may request four writes (1-2-3-4) in that order, but the controller may decide the quickest way to write them is 4-3-1-2. The controller essentially lies to the operating system and reports that the writes have been completed in order (a lie that improves performance at the expense of data corruption if power is lost), and the battery backup hedges against the risk of data corruption by giving the controller a way to silently fix any and all damage that could occur as a result. If the power gets shut off after element 4 has been written, the battery backed memory contains the record of commitment for the other three items and ensures that they are written (\\"flushed\\") to the disk at the next available opportunity. Transaction consistency Consistency (database systems) in the realm of Distributed database systems refers to the property of many ACID databases to ensure that the results of a Database transaction are visible to all nodes simultaneously. That is, once the transaction has been committed all parties attempting to access the database can see the results of that transaction simultaneously. A good example of the importance of transaction consistency is a database that handles the transfer of money. Suppose a money transfer requires two operations: writing a debit in one place, and a credit in another. If the system crashes or shuts down when one operation has completed but the other has not, and there is nothing in place to correct this, the system can be said to lack transaction consistency. With a money transfer, it is desirable that either the entire transaction completes, or none of it completes. Both of these scenarios keep the balance in check. Transaction consistency ensures just that - that a system is programmed to be able to detect incomplete transactions when powered on, and undo (or \\"roll back\\") the portion of any incomplete transactions that are found. Application consistency Application Consistency, similar to Transaction consistency, is applied on a grander scale. Instead of having the scope of a single transaction, data must be consistent within the confines of many different transaction streams from one or more applications. An application may be made up of many different types of data, various types of files and data feeds from other applications. Application consistency is the state in which all related files and databases are synchronized representing the true status of the application.

In his essay on sexual morality, Offenses Against One's Self, nineteenth-century British philosopher Jeremy Bentham provided the following definition of the term: :There was a particular name for those who had past the short period beyond which no man hoped to be an object of desire to his own sex. They were called exoleti. No male therefore who was passed this short period of life could expect to find in this way any reciprocity of affection; he must be as odious to the boy from the beginning as in a short time the boy would be to him. The objects of this kind of sensuality would therefore come only in the place of common prostitutes; they could never even to a person of this depraved taste answer the purposes of a virtuous woman.Jeremy Bentham, Offences Against One's Self However, the word is sometimes also applied to adolescents, puberes exoleti, as in the Scriptores Historiae Augustae 7.5.4.4. In an essay on Roman erotic art, John Pollini has argued that the term referred not to age but to prostitutes who had become physically \\"worn out\\" by frequent anal penetration.John Pollini, \\"The Warren Cup: Homoerotic Love and Symposial Rhetoric in Silver,\\" Art Bulletin 81.1 (1999) 47-48. John Boswell argued that the term \\"exoletus\\" distinguished an active from a passive male prostitute, or \\"catamitus\\", from which the English word \\"catamite\\" is derived.John Boswell (1980). Christianity, Social Tolerance and Homosexulaity. Chicago University Press. . In the article \\"Some Myths and Anomalies in the Study of Roman Sexuality\\" in the Journal of Homosexuality, James L. Butrica argued that the term did not refer to prostitutes at all.The Haworth Press Online Catalog: Article Abstract The word is found in Seneca's Epistulae 95.24,Transeo puerorum infelicium greges quos post transacta convivia aliae cubiculi contumeliae expectant; transeo agmina exoletorum per nationes coloresque discripta ut eadem omnibus levitas sit, eadem primae mensura lanuginis, eadem species capillorum, ne quis cui rectior est coma crispulis misceatur; transeo pistorum turbam, transeo ministratorum per quos signo dato ad inferendam cenam discurritur.

Burt (born June 7, 1959 in Orchard Park, New York) is a former American football player who played for the New York Giants and San Francisco 49ers in the National Football League (NFL). Burt played nose tackle for the Giants team that won Super Bowl XXI and the 49ers team that won Super Bowl XXIV. College career Burt played college football at the University of Miami and was inducted into its sports hall of fame.Football Inductees , umsporsthalloffame.com, accessed January 13, 2007. Raised in western New York state, he had dreamed of playing for Syracuse, but they advised him to attend prep school first. Professional career Burt joined the Giants as an undrafted free agent in 1981. He made the Pro Bowl in 1986 and finished his career with his 20 quarterback sacks. Burt was respected throughout the league for his toughness and determination, which resulted in him going from being an undrafted rookie free agent to a Pro Bowler.Gola, Hank. Burt with 'Boys as Tuna helper, November 1, 2006, accessed April 29, 2007. He is also known for knocking out 49ers quarterback Joe Montana on a pass in the 1986 NFC Divisional Playoff game. Montana's pass was picked off and returned for a touchdown by Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor. The Giants won, 49-3, on their way to winning Super Bowl XXI. Although many people often credit Harry Carson and Lawrence Taylor with inventing the \\"Gatorade Shower\\" on coaches following wins, Burt actually created it in 1984.Highlights from the History of Gatorade, amanet.org, accessed January 13, 2007. The Giants had finished 3–12–1 in 1983, last place in the NFC East and third-worst in the 28-team league. As Carson stated in his 1987 book Point of Attack:The Defense Strikes Back, head coach Bill Parcells was especially hard on Burt in practice. Parcells on the Thursday before the game made Burt raise a dumbbell repeatedly off the ground in the weight room for 45 minutes to simulate raising his arm powerfully out of his stance at the snap of the ball. Burt exacted revenge on Parcells after a 37–13 home win over the two-time defending NFC champion Washington Redskins on October 28 by dousing him with a cooler of water. The following season, the Giants dumped Gatorade on Parcells on October 20; it was another home win over the Redskins, but after consecutive losses to Dallas and Cincinnati. This became a tradition in football, analogous to the champagne showers teams make in their locker rooms after winning a championship. Burt was known to wear an extremely tight jersey causing him to stick out in a crowd. To protect against opposing players grabbing onto his jersey he opted to wear one that was several sizes smaller. He would need assistance pulling it in and off for each game, sometimes even using scissors to cut off the jersey after the game. Burt battled back problems with the New York Giants which ultimately caused Parcells to announce his retirement in 1988. Burt, however, was not ready to retire and instead joined the San Francisco 49ers for the 1989 season. He won his second NFL title when they defeated the Denver Broncos 55–10 in Super Bowl XXIV. During the 2006 season, Burt travelled to Dallas to give moral support to his former tormentor Parcells who was then head coach of the Dallas Cowboys. He also delivered a pre-game speech and stood on the sidelines exulting Dallas' defensive players. Personal Burt's son Jim Burt, Jr. followed in his father's footsteps and went to the University of Miami, but played baseball rather than football for the Hurricanes. Junior also played for a CT collegiate baseball team the Torrington Twisters. Burt lived in Allendale, New Jersey when he was playing for the Giants.Araton, Harvey. \\"Sports of The Times\\", The New York Times, December 13, 1998. Accessed August 21, 2011. \\"They would say things like, 'When we saw a macho guy like you do it. . .' Burt said from his Allendale, N.J., home. I remember thinking, 'I can't believe this.' I couldn't believe men, fathers, could actually think that way. I always thought the macho thing to do was hug your kid.\\" He has since been a resident of Saddle River, New Jersey. He played high school football in Orchard Park, New York, a suburb of Buffalo and the home of the Bills. His teammates at Orchard Park High School included Craig Wolfley, later an offensive lineman with the Pittsburgh Steelers, and Larry Pfohl, who found fame as professional wrestler Lex Luger.

A diplomat and technocrat by profession, he joined Foreign Services in 1951 and held important diplomatic assignments in the United States, China, and the United Nations. He served as the Foreign secretary— the leading bureaucratic position in Pakistan Government— in 1973 until 1977, after Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's government was dismissed (see Codename Fair Play). However, he immediately served as the foreign policy adviser to upcoming Chief Martial Law Administrator General Zia-ul-Haq who appointed him as the Foreign Minister shortly after assuming the control of the country. In 1982, after losing General Zia's favour when he made an attempt to keep country on Non-Aligned Movement membership, he lost the foreign affairs ministry to senior military officer Lieutenant-General Yakob Ali Khan. His relationship with General Zia- ul-Haq and his military government further deteriorated, with General Zia complaining about Shahi's speech on improving Pakistan's relations with Soviet Union and the Non-Aligned Movement. He departed from country in 1982 to join the United Nations General Assembly and served as the Chairman of UN Committee on Elimination of Racial Discrimination until 1990, and served as the Chairman of the Pakistan delegation at World Conference on Human Rights. During his last years, he associated with the Institute of Strategic Studies (ISS), Islamabad where he served as its President until his death. Diplomatic career Agha Shahi was born in Bangalore, former Mysore state and present-day Karnataka, India to the Urdu-speaking community, the son of educator who was the local principal of British government-sanctioned school. He was educated in Bangalore, excelling the science courses he took in school. In 1939, Shahi enrolled in Indian Institute of Science where he joined the Department of Physics, and receiving his BSc in Physics, followed by MSc in applied physics and MA in Mathematics in 1944. Following his master's degree, he joined the faculty of Mathematics teaching undergraduate calculus courses but his parents were unsatisfied of their son being a scientist; therefore, encouraged by his parents, Shahi soon left his position after applying at the Indian Civil Service in 1944. He took the advanced exam, \\"All India Competitive Examinations\\", where he excelled and was commissioned in the Indian civil service soon after. His first assignment was Sindh Province as a Commission of Education Department, and the family moved to Karachi, Sindh. In 1947, he opted for Pakistan citizenship, and served as the constitutional adviser to Chief Ministers of Sindh Province Ghulam Hussain Hidayat Ullah from 1947 till 1948, and to Ayub Khuhro from 1948 until 1949. In 1949, the Governor George Baxandall Constantine appointed him as the Commissioner of District Thatta. In 1967, Shahi gained a Master of Science in Strategic studies from Defence & Strategic Studies (DSS) Department. Shahi had a long career as a Pakistani diplomat, beginning in 1951. He served as Pakistan's ambassador to the United Nations, and China and also served in many other positions. Early career as an ambassador He opted for the Foreign Service of Pakistan in 1951 and played a prominent role in formulation of foreign policy right from the early years of Pakistan's creation. He was part of various delegations to the United Nations during the 1950s and 1960s and served with A.S. Bokhari (known as Patras Bokhari), Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan and Prince Aly Khan (father of Prince Karim Aga Khan and Pakistan's permanent representative to UN). Shahi served as Counselor in the Pakistan Embassy in Washington from 1955–58. He was Pakistan's Deputy Permanent Representative to UN from 1958–61 and later served as Permanent Representative to United Nations from 1967–72. During his term as permanent representative to United Nations, he played an important role in enabling China to become a member of the United Nations. He became Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1964 and served in that position till 1967. Foreign Minister of Pakistan In 1972, he was appointed Pakistan's Ambassador to China. In 1973, Shahi became Foreign Secretary and served in that position till the fall of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1977. Shahi was appointed Advisor on foreign affairs/foreign minister in 1977 by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq and resigned from the position of foreign minister in 1982, after developing serious differences with General Zia. Post-resignation activities Shahi led various delegations of Pakistan to UN General Assembly, conferences of Non-Aligned Movement and Organization of Islamic Conference. He was a member of various UN commissions and was also elected Chairman of the UN Committee on Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) of which he had been a member since 1982. In 1993, Shahi was Co- Chairman of the Pakistan delegation to the World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna. Shahi also served as Chairman of Institute of Strategic Studies in Islamabad and headed Islamabad Council of World Affairs – a private think tank. He was the younger brother of Agha Hilaly who also joined ICS and later opted for Pakistan's foreign service, serving as Pakistan's Ambassador in important capitals such as London, Moscow and Washington (at a time when his younger brother Shahi was Pakistan's permanent representative to UN in New York).

A high proportion of damp problems in buildings are caused by ambient climate dependent factors of condensation and rain penetration. Capillary penetration of fluid from the ground up through concrete or masonry is known as \\"rising damp\\" and is governed by the shape and porosity of the construction materials through which this evaporation limited capillary penetration takes place. Structural damp, regardless of the mechanisms through which it takes place, is exacerbated by higher levels of humidity. Symptoms Dampness tends to cause secondary damage to a building. The unwanted moisture enables the growth of various fungi in wood, causing rot or mould health issues and may eventually lead to sick building syndrome. Plaster and paint deteriorate and wallpaper loosens. Stains, from the water, salts and from mould, mar surfaces. The highest airborne mould concentrations are found in buildings where significant mould infestation has occurred, usually as a result of severe water intrusion or flood damage. Moulds can grow on almost any surface and occur where there is a lot of moisture from structural problems such as leaky roofs or high humidity levels. Airborne mold concentrations have the potential to be inhaled and can have health effects.ODPM: Housing Health and Safety Rating System: Operating Guidance. Externally, mortar may crumble and salt stains may appear on the walls. Steel and iron fasteners rust. It may also cause a poor indoor air quality and respiratory illness in occupants. In extreme cases, mortar or plaster may fall away from the affected wall. Health effects of structural damp Health concerns around mould include infections, allergenic or immunological illness, and nonallergic illness. Asthma is also triggered by the sensitization of dust mites accruing humid, wet regions of a structure. Another health effect associated with structural dampness is the presence of bacteria in an indoor environment. Bacteria require water to grow and multiply and certain species can cause disease in humans, thus the intrusion of water into an indoor environment can place the health of occupants at risk from bacterial infections. Water removal and drying of wet building materials within 2 days will likely prevent mould and bacteria growth, therefore reducing occupants' vulnerability to disease. A Visual Guide to Damp, Mold and Indoor Pollution stated that: Statutory requirements (UK) Building Regulations Section 5.2 of The Building Regulations 2010 Approved Document C, \\"Site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture\\" requires that buildings should be constructed to resist rising damp, penetrating damp, and condensation. Walls should: a) resist the passage of moisture from the ground to the inside of the building; and b) not be damaged by moisture from the ground and not carry moisture from the ground to any part which would be damaged by it, and, if the wall is an external wall: c) resist the penetration of precipitation to components of the structure that might be damaged by moisture; and d) resist the penetration of precipitation to the inside of the building; and e) be designed and constructed so that their structural and thermal performance is not adversely affected by interstitial condensation; and f) not promote surface condensation or mould growth, given reasonable occupancy conditions. Similar requirements are also made in reference to floors in Section 4 of the document. Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act The Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018 requires private landlords in England and Wales to ensure that houses that they rent are \\"free from damp.,\\" Identification A wide range of instruments and techniques can be used to investigate the presence of moisture in building materials. When used correctly, they can provide a valuable aid to investigation. The competence and experience of the person undertaking the damp investigations is often of greater importance than the kit he or she carries. Experience and qualified surveyors are the difference between a correct and incorrect diagnosis of damp. For example, it is sometimes found that condensation is misdiagnosed as another form of dampness resulting in the wrong form of treatment being specified. Chartered building surveyors are usually experienced in identifying dampness issues, however, their reports often suggest that dampness problems are investigated by a specialist damp and timber surveyor with a CSRT qualification. Prevention and treatment Most forms of dampness can be prevented by thoughtful building design and careful construction. In the UK, well built modern houses include damp proofing in the form of a synthetic damp-proof course (DPC), about 15 cm above ground level, to act as a barrier through which water cannot pass. Slate or \\"engineering bricks\\" with a low porosity were often used for the first few courses above ground level, and these can help minimise the problem. There are many approaches to the treatment of dampness in existing buildings. Key to the selection of an appropriate treatment is a correct diagnosis of the types of dampness affecting a building. Details of possible treatments for specific types of dampness are covered in the sections below. The cause of the dampness must first be eliminated, by providing better drainage or fixing leaking pipes. Several methods of treating rising damp are possible, including the use of land-drains and the insertion of physical and chemical DPCs. Then, any affected plaster or mortar must be removed, and the wall treated, before replacing the plaster and repainting. Humidity Humidity occurs in indoor environments due to building related causes. Porous walls, rising damp, and leaks in the building are determinants for structural dampness due to elevated humidity levels. The construction of the building can also lead to humidity and unwanted moisture in the indoor environment. Wet materials, such as lumber stored unprotected outdoors before construction, can lead to increased humidity indoors for up to the second year of occupancy in the building. Most commonly in residences, elevated relative humidity is produced by poor drainage systems. This leads to dampness in substructures such as crawlspaces and basements. The dampness results in vaporization where water vapor is transmitted into the building's interiors. Water vapor may enter the building through supply air ducts in building slabs and circulated by warm forced air. Water vapor can also enter a building through leaky return air ducts in homes with crawlspaces. Human occupancy adds a significant amount of humidity to the indoor environment. Personal activity as basic as breathing and perspiration add moisture to an indoor space. Cooking and showering raise humidity levels in the indoor environment, which directly affects the structural dampness of a home. Aspects of the home can also increase the humidity of a space. Items such as aquariums, indoor swimming pools, hot tubs, and even indoor plants add to the humidity of an indoor space. All of these attributes can increase the humidity of a home beyond its recommended thirty to fifty percent. Humidity levels in an indoor environment need to be accounted for based upon season and temperature. If humidity levels do not agree with the time of the year and the temperature during seasons, mold infestation and deterioration of the building will occur due to moisture. An acceptable humidity level in indoor spaces ranges from twenty to sixty per cent year round. However, levels less than twenty per cent in the winter and levels higher than sixty per cent in the summer are deemed unacceptable for indoor air quality. Structural dampness is likely to occur as well as an increase of health risks associated with moisture damage. Prevention and treatment There are strategies to prevent water infiltration due to humidity into structures, as well as ways to treat human occupancy practices regarding humidity. Vapor retarders are materials that can be used to restrain uncontrolled airflow and water vapor into an indoor space. Vapor retarders are used to decrease the rate and amount of water vapor diffusion through ceilings, walls, and floors caused by humidity. It is made of thin, flexible materials and its coatings can be installed by trowels or brushes. Utilizing vapor retarders in a building prevents structural dampness from occurring or continuing if it already exists. A strategy for reducing humidity levels in an indoor environment is by altering occupant activity and indoor mechanics. Kitchens and bathrooms need to have their own vents. Additionally, washing machines need to be vented outdoors. Both of these are important in order to decrease indoor moisture due to humidity caused by the activities occurring in these indoor spaces. Moisture sources, such as hot tubs or indoor swimming pools, should be covered by airtight lids when not in use, thus humidity levels stay low in the indoor environment///-. Condensation Condensation comes from water vapour within the building. Common sources may include cooking, bathing, dishwashers, etc. The moisture in the air condenses on cold surfaces, sometimes inside the walls called interstitial condensation. Buildings with poorly insulated walls are very prone to this problem. It often causes damage similar to damp in a building and often appears in similar places. This is because it occurs in the \\"dead air\\" pockets that accumulate in both horizontal and vertical corners (i.e. out of circulating air patterns). Mould growth caused by condensation in dead air pocket behind books Moisture condenses on the interiors of buildings due to specific interactions between the roof and wall. Leaks most commonly occur on flat-roofed buildings. Certain building materials and mechanisms can be used to prevent condensation from occurring in these areas, therefore reducing structural dampness and potential mold infestation. In many cases, the insulation between the roof and wall is compressed, leading to a decrease in thermal resistance. Due to the lack of thermal resistance, condensation occurs, which leads to water damage in the indoor environment. In most cases where moisture is not addressed quickly enough, mold and mildew develop. Another issue is that wind washing up into the crevice where the roof and wall intersect reduces the efficiency of the insulation. This results in condensation and risk for mold growth. In the United Kingdom, condensation problems are particularly common between October and March – to the extent that this period is often referred to as the \\"condensation season.\\"The Condensation Season - October until March, Peter MacDonald - Condensation Explained. Identification of condensation If it is suspected that the problem is condensation, then a room should be sealed off with a dehumidifier left running for the recommended time and then further instrument tests made. If the dampness has disappeared, then condensation is very likely the problem. Alternatively Humiditect cards or dataloggers (measuring air humidity, air temperature, and surface temperature) can be used as tools for diagnosing a condensation problem.How can I check for condensation?, Peter MacDonald - Condensation Explained. Treatment Typical remedies for condensation include increasing background heat and ventilation, improving the insulation of cold surfaces and reducing moisture generation (e.g. by avoiding the drying of clothes indoors). Rain penetration Rain Penetration (also known as \\"penetrating damp\\"()) is a common form of dampness in buildings. It can occur through walls, roofs, or through openings (e.g. window reveals). Water will often penetrate the outer envelope of a building and appear inside. Common defects include: * Roof defects such as faulty flashing, cracked or missing slates or tiles. * Faults in the brickwork or masonry such as missing or cracked pointing. Porous bricks or stones. * Missing or defective mastic around windows and doors. * Blocked weep holes. * Missing or defective trays in cavity walls. Walls Rain penetration is most often associated with single-skin walls, but can also occur through cavity walls - e.g. by tracking across wall ties. Single-skin brick walls of standard thickness (9 inches) have been considered to provide inadequate resistance to rain penetration for many years, which is why cavity wall construction is now standard in the UK. The 1944 Housing Manual published by the Ministry of Works and the Ministry of Health stated that: > \\"The resistance to penetration of rain should not be less than that of > 11-in. brick cavity wall, properly designed and constructed with attention > to details at the heads and joints of openings. An unrendered 9-in. wall is > regarded as substandard.\\" Whilst renders are often applied in an attempt to resist rain penetration, they must be maintained in good condition in order to fulfil this function. Even relatively small cracks in renders can allow rain penetration to pass into the underlying masonry. In his 1954 book, \\"The Restoration of Old Houses\\" Hugh Braun highlighted problems inherent in certain types of render that were widely used in the late eighteenth century and throughout the Victorian era: \\"By the end of the eighteenth century a number of patent water-repellent cements were appearing on the market, the most popular of which, roman cement, continued in universal use throughout the Victorian era; many old buildings were rendered with this substance. Its adhesion was poor and it will often be found that it has become separated from the walling over considerable areas and can be stripped away in large sheets.\\" Primary Causes * Porous masonry (i.e. under-fired bricks, porous stone, or porous mortar) * Cracks * Defective pointing * Unfilled joints and perpends, * Defective seals around doors and windows * Holes in walls – e.g. where cables or pipes protrude * Defective render Exacerbators of Rain penetration Where a wall suffers from one or more of the primary causes of rain penetration listed above, the problem can be made worse by one of the following exacerbators of rain penetration: * Defective rainwater goods * Moss growth on roof tiles (causing blockage of rainwater goods) * Defective or missing window sills (causing high concentrations of rainwater to bear on section of wall below window) * Non- breathable coatings such as acrylic masonry paints – especially where applied to a poorly prepared masonry substrate * Location/aspect of wall – e.g. walls facing prevailing wind are more prone to rain penetration problems (see BS8104) * Periods of extreme rainfall – walls that are normally thick enough to prevent rainfall from reaching the inner face can be overwhelmed during periods of heavy, persistent rainfall Modifications to a building involving impermeable materials can also exacerbate the symptoms of rain penetration by trapping moisture. This can be a particular problem with regard to the installation of retrofit external wall insulation (EWI). Rising damp Moderate rising damp on an internal wall. Rising damp is the common term for absorption of water in the lower sections of walls and other ground-supported structures by capillary action. Although rising damp of up to 5 metres in height has been observedDamp Buildings Old and New - G and I Massari - the height of rise is typically much lower and is rarely above 1.5m. Rising damp has been a widely observed phenomenon for at least two hundred years. There is also strong evidence to suggest that it was a problem understood by the Romans and Ancient Greeks.The Roman Villa (Villa Urbana) - Alfred Frazer - - p. 36 In common with most other forms of dampness, rising damp is often misdiagnosed in buildings. Many misdiagnose a wall stain as rising damp instance due to misinterpreting the visual evidence of the wall and the readings of moisture meters. Effect of placing a porous brick in a shallow tray of water.In simple terms rising damp occurs when ground water travels upwards through porous building materials such as brick, sandstone, or mortar, much in the same way that oil travels upwards through the wick of a lamp. The effect can easily be seen by simply placing a piece of porous brick, stone, or mortar in a shallow tray of water and observing how the water is absorbed into the porous material and is transported above the water line. Rising damp can be identified by a characteristic \\"tide mark\\" on the lower section of affected walls. This tide mark is caused by soluble salts (particularly nitrates and chlorides) contained in the groundwater. Due to the effects of evaporation these salts accumulate at the \\"peak\\" of the rising damp. Due to rising damp often being caused by moisture from wet ground, it is not common to find rising damp on floors above ground level.  History  Damp Houses - British Medical Journal - May 25th 1872 The issue of rising damp has been a concern since ancient times. The Roman Architect Vitruvius referred to the problem of dampness rising up walls and advised on how to construct buildings to avoid the problem.A History of Architectural Conservation - Jukka Jokilehto - - p. 3Roman Baths in Britain - Tony Rook - - p. 14 Rising damp is widely referred to in Victorian literature and the Public Health Act of 1875 introduced the requirement for a damp-proof course in walls to prevent rising damp. An entry in the British Medical Journal from 1872 describes the phenomenon of rising damp as follows: \\"Next we look, but in vain, for any signs of a damp proof course, or for any gratings to show that ventilation to the ground floor joists has not been forgotten. The results of the first two defects are visible enough in the house as it now exists, in the damp and green stains which are everywhere to be seen from the level of the ground to some two or three feet up the walls.\\" Helps To Health, Sir Henry Burdett (1885), p. 138. In July 1860 it was reported in The Engineer that The architect and social reformer, Thomas Worthington, described rising damp in his 1892 essay, \\"The Dwellings of the Poor: And Weekly Wage-Earners in and Around Towns\\": In his publication, \\"Helps to Health\\" (1885), the financier and philanthropist, Henry Burdett, explains the need for an effective damp-proof course in order to protect against rising damp: Vitrified stone-ware damp-course Gaps between damp course for damp to rise in jerry-built house - Helps To Health, Sir Henry Burdett (1885), page 124 Henry Burdett was deeply concerned with the quality building in Victorian England, and he cautioned would-be house buyers to check houses for the presence of a damp-proof course and to ensure that it is of an effective type. As an example of poor workmanship leading to an ineffective damp proof course, Burdett cites the following example:  Skepticism  Rising damp is a phenomenon that is fully predicted by the laws of physics, has been researched on a worldwide scale, and has been documented since Roman times. Nevertheless, a small number of people have expressed the view that rising damp is a myth and that it is, in fact, impossible for moisture to rise from the ground into the wall structure through pores in the masonry. A former chairman of the construction arm of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), Stephen Boniface, has said that 'true rising damp' is a myth and chemically injected damp-proof courses (DPC) are 'a complete waste of money'. However he has recently clarified this statement on a comment post made on the Surveying Property website, Konrad Fisher's article \\"The Fraud of Rising Damp\\" points out that the historic city hall in Bamberg stands in the river Regnitz and its bridge remains dry without any chemical, mechanical or electronic damp-proof course. However, proponents of rising damp suggest that not all walls are capable of supporting rising damp, so merely observing that rising damp does not occur in a particular wall does not disprove its existence in other walls. In 1997 the housing disrepair team at Lewisham Council in south London were so convinced that rising damp was a myth that they offered a reward of £50 to anyone who could show them a genuine case of it. Manager Mike Parrett said \\"The point of the reward is to convince our tenants that rising damp is a myth.\\" Lewisham has never found a genuine case of rising damp and has never paid out the £50 reward. Water intrusion into the indoor environment can be attributed from causes other than rising damp. Moisture penetration has been an ongoing problem for residences as evaporation occurs at the edge of the damp area, resulting in \\"tide marks\\" due to salt deposition. The \\"tide mark\\" is commonly distinguished as a feature of rising damp. However, even after the water intrusion has been treated, these salt accumulations still persist. This suggests that rising damp is not always the cause for the water penetration. The Building Research Establishment (BRE) in its review concludes that rising damp is a real problem. How rising damp occurs According to Jurin's law the maximum height of rise is inversely proportional to the capillary radius. Taking a typical pore radius for building materials of 1 µm, Jurin's Law would give a maximum rise of about 15 m, however, due to the effects of evaporation, in practice the rise would be considerably lower. A physical model of rising damp was developed by Christopher Hall and William D Hoff in their paper \\"Rising damp: capillary rise dynamics in walls\\". The analysis is based on experimentally well established properties of porous building materials and the physics of evaporation from building surfaces. Hall and Hoff show that the model can be used to predict the height to which damp will rise in a wall. The height of rise depends on the wall thickness, the sorptivity of the wall structure and the rate of evaporation. Further work has confirmed experimentally the importance of mortar properties in determining the height to which damp will rise in walls. BRE Digest 245 lists several factors that can influence the height of the rise including rate of evaporation from the wall, pore sizes of the masonry, salt content of the materials and the soil, groundwater and degree of saturation, and use of heating within the property. The effect of seasonal variations in evaporation rate on the height of moisture rise have been comprehensively described. A review of data and publications commissioned by the Property Care Association and carried out by the University of Portsmouth concluded that \\"Rising damp is an age-old and ubiquitous problem.\\" It also noted that \\"Records on observation and descriptions on this phenomenon date back to early times. It was identified as a public health issue in the second half of the 19th Century.\\" The review looked at data and studies on rising damp from a number of countries including the United Kingdom, Portugal, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Greece, Australia, and Malaysia. Diagnosis of rising damp A wall affected by rising damp. The first step in assessing damp is to check for standing water. Removing water with good drainage will remove any form of dampness. Once done, and dampness remains, the next step is to look for the presence of a damp-proof course. If a damp- proof course is present, it is likely to be functioning, as the materials from which damp proof courses are manufactured tend to have a long lifespan. However, it should be acknowledged that there are cases where existing damp proof courses fail for one reason or another. One indicator that is often used to determine if the source of dampness is rising damp (rather than other forms of dampness) is to look for the presence of salts – in particular a tell tale \\"salt band\\" or \\"tide mark\\" at the peak of the damp's rise. This is not a reliable method as salts and dampness can enter the fabric of the wall in other ways – e.g. unwashed sea sand or gravel used in the construction of the wall. If there is no damp-proof course and rising damp is suspected (tide mark, moisture confined to lower section of wall etc. ...) then a number of diagnostic techniques can be used to determine the source of dampness. BRE Digest 245 states that the most satisfactory approach is to obtain samples of mortar in the affected wall using a drill and then analysing these samples to determine their moisture and salt content to assist in providing appropriate remedial building solutions. The fact that this technique is destructive to the wall finish often makes it unacceptable to homeowners. It is for this reason that electrical moisture meters are often used when surveying for rising damp. These instruments are unable to accurately measure the moisture content of masonry, as they were developed for use on timber, but the reading patterns that are achieved can provide useful indicators of the source of dampness. Rising damp treatment In many cases, damp is caused by \\"bridging\\" of a damp-proof course that is otherwise working effectively. For example, a flower bed next to an affected wall might result in soil being piled up against the wall above the level of the DPC. In this example, moisture from the ground would be able to ingress through the wall from the soil. Such a damp problem could be rectified by simply lowering the flower bed to below DPC level. Where a rising damp problem is caused by a lack of a damp- proof course (common in buildings over approximately 100 years old) or by a failed damp-proof course (comparatively rare) there are a wide range of possible solutions available. These include: * Replacement physical damp proof course * Injection of a liquid or cream chemical damp proof course (DPC Injection) * Damp-proofing rods * Porous tubes / other evaporative * Land drainage * Electrical-osmotic systems Replacement physical damp proof course An example of a damp proof course of slate in a brick wall intended to prevent rising damp A physical damp proof course made from plastic can be installed into an existing building by cutting into short sections of the mortar course, and installing short sections of the damp proof course material. This method can provide an extremely effective barrier to rising damp, but is not widely used as it requires experienced contractors to carry out if structural movement is to be avoided and takes considerably longer to install than other types of rising damp treatment. The cost is also several times higher than for other types of rising damp treatment. Injection of a liquid or cream chemical damp proof course (DPC Injection) Injection of a liquid or cream into bricks or mortar is the most common method of treating rising damp. Adolf Wilhelm Keim describes the use of a hot bitumen remedial damp-proof course that is injected into holes drilled into a wall in his 1902 publication \\"The Prevention of Dampness in Buildings.\\" Liquid-injection products were introduced in the 1950s and were typically installed using funnels (gravity feed method) or pressured injection pumps. The effectiveness of liquid injection damp proofing products is dependent on the type of formulation and the skill of the installer. In practice injection times tend to be lower than those required to provide a damp proof course of optimum effectiveness. A paper published in Building and Environment in 1990 made the following calculations about injection times: =Damp-Proofing Creams= Damp-proofing cream leaking from injection holes. This can make it difficult to ascertain whether sufficient cream has remained in the holes for treatment to be successful. Since the early 2000s, damp-proofing creams have taken over from liquid products due to improved ease of application. As with liquid products these are based on silane/siloxane active ingredients which line the pores of the mortar to repel damp. The effectiveness of liquid and cream based rising damp treatments varies considerably between products due to variations in product formulations. Independent test certifications such as British Board of Agreement (BBA) certificates are available for some products, showing that they have met a minimum requirement for product performance - see #Damp_(structural)/Effectiveness_of_rising_damp_treatments As with liquid injection systems, cream based treatments rely on the competence of the installer for treatment to be successful. Injection holes need to be fully cleared of drill dust and debris before the cream is injected, and it is often difficult to know if each injection hole has been completely filled with cream. Furthermore, damp-proofing cream can sometimes drip out of the injection holes after treatment, reducing the effectiveness of the damp- proofing treatment. Damp-proofing rods A packet of damp-proofing rods Damp-proofing rods installed along a mortar course to treat rising damp by forming a damp-proof course (DPC)Damp-proofing rods use similar active ingredients to those found in liquid or cream-based rising damp treatments, but contained in a solid rod. They are generally considered to be easier to use than other types of rising damp treatment as the method of installation is simply to insert them into the correct sized holes drilled into a mortar bed. Damp-proofing rods are available with BBA approval. The rods are placed into holes drilled in the mortar course and the active ingredients diffuse along the mortar line before curing to form a damp-proof course. Damp-proofing rods are usually supplied in 180mm lengths suitable for inserting into a 9-inch thick wall. For treating half-brick thick (4.5 inch) walls, the rods are simply cut in half. A benefit of damp-proofing rods compared with damp- proofing creams and liquids is that it is possible to guarantee a consistent dose of active ingredient into each hole drilled in the mortar course – i.e. it is impossible to under-fill the holes. Porous tubes Porous tubes are installed along a mortar course. In theory these encourage evaporation and reduce the rise of the damp. Independent test certification are available for this type of product and tests carried out by the Building Research Establishment suggest that they are effective at controlling rising damp. Porous tubes used to treat rising damp are visible on the outside of this Victorian house. Land drainage It has been suggested that improving drainage around walls affected by rising damp can help to reduce the height of rise by reducing the amount of water available to be absorbed into the capillaries of the wall. Typically a trench would be excavated around the affected wall into which a porous pipe would be laid. The trench would then be back-filled with a porous material such as a single-sized aggregate, forming a French drain. Such a system would obviously have the practical disadvantage of being suitable only for the treatment of outside walls and would be impractical where other buildings are close by or where a building has shallow footings. Although the theory of reducing rising damp by reducing the amount of moisture in the underlying ground would appear to be sound, there is little data to suggest that it is effective in practice. Indeed, G and I Massari stated in the ICCROM publication \\"Damp Buildings Old and New\\" that little effect was observed with \\"open trenching\\" and no effect was observed with \\"covered trenching.\\" Electrical-osmotic systems These attempt to control rising damp through the phenomenon of electro osmosis. Whilst there is evidence to suggest that these systems can be useful in moving salts in walls there is little in the way of independent data to demonstrate effectiveness in treating rising damp. The BRE publication \\"Understanding Dampness\\" makes the following observations about electro osmotic systems for the treatment of rising damp: Effectiveness of rising damp treatments BRE Digest 245 suggests that with the exception of replacement physical DPCs, only methods of treatment with third party accreditation (e.g. British Board of Agrément Certificate) should be considered for the treatment of rising damp. It then goes on to state that the only method of currently satisfying this requirement is DPC injection (liquid or cream – although damp-proofing rods have subsequently been made available with BBA approval) and that \\"this is the only method which BRE considers suitable where insertion of a physical DPC is not possible.\\" The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveryors (RICS) publication \\"Remedying Damp\\" is more cautious about reliance on third party accreditation, casting doubt upon the validity of the test methods employed, arguing that trials are usually conducted using \\"specially built masonry panels – which do not match up in many respects to walls found in real properties,\\" and that \\"if a DPC were proved work in a specially built masonry panel, this would be the more significant result.\\" The MOAT No 39 test employed by the British Board of Agrément (BBA) in the UK is dismissed as \\"quite a clever test idea but in the author's opinion not actually replicating a real wall.\\" The author, Ralph Burkinshaw, has developed his own test method which he has published under the title, \\"The rising damp tests of Camberwell Pier: Potential height of moisture rise in brickwork and the effectiveness of a modern chemical injection cream damp coursing application.\\" In April 2014 the British Board of Agrément confirmed that it would consult with manufacturers and holders of BBA certificates with a view to updating the MOAT No.39 test in light of the fact that it was not originally designed to test damp proofing creams and these have become the most popular type of rising damp treatment. This replaces a draft BBA guidance note that said Damp-proofing creams differ from fluid-based damp-proofing treatments in a number of ways: # Creams are applied at much lower application rates than is typical for fluid injection and are designed to spread through masonry by diffusion without the assistance of pressure injection. Owing to the number of different mortar types and moisture contents, it is necessary to test these materials under a wider range of conditions. Research undertaken by the BBA has indicated that the performance of creams differs with varying test conditions, with not all products performing well under all test conditions. # The amount of active material delivered per linear metre varies considerably between cream formulations. Injection systems were typically injected at an application rate of approximately 100g of active ingredient per linear metre of 275 mm (9 inch) thick wall. However, because the strength of cream formulations used in the UK can vary widely, the applied amount of delivered active material varied from 22g to 107g per linear metre depending on product strength. As there is limited historical data on the durability of chemical creams with low levels of active material, it is difficult to draw conclusions on their life expectancy in comparison to high strength creams which have similar active material levels to injected systems. In his book, Dampness in Buildings, Alan Oliver refers to research carried out in Belgium regarding the effectiveness of different types of rising damp treatments: Replastering Replastering will often be carried out as part of a rising damp treatment. Where plaster has become severely damaged by ground salts there is little argument about the need to replaster. However, there is considerable debate about: # The extent of replastering required # The use of hard sand:cement renders to replaster as part of a rising damp treatment Plaster removed from a wall as part of a rising damp treatment. The wall was replastered using a sand-cement render. BS6576:2005 states that \\"the function of the new plaster is to prevent hygroscopic salts that might be present in the wall from migrating through to its surface, while still allowing the wall to dry.\\" However, writing in the RICS publication \\"Remedying Damp\\", Ralph Burkinshaw claims that, \\"the plaster is really there for main reasons.\\" He accepts the need for replastering when significant amounts of ground salts have built up in the existing plaster, but he then goes on to say that replastering is often carried out to make up for an unreliable chemical DPC. He also suggests that damp-proofers have an incentive to carry out more replastering than is strictly necessary as it allows them to finish the job without having to wait for walls to dry out, resulting in faster payment. Application of a sand:cement render to a wall as part of a rising damp treatment Although the sand-cement renders typically installed as part of a rising damp treatment are very effective at holding back damp and ground salts, they have a number of disadvantages. These include an incompatibility with the soft bricks and mortars encountered in older buildings and a lack of insulation properties compared with more traditional plasters, resulting in an increased risk of condensation. Replastering is also one of the most expensive parts of a rising damp treatment. Porous renders to German WTA specification 2-2-91 can be used as an alternative to dense sand- cement renders. These have a minimum porosity of 40% of total volume. Salts crystallise in these pores rather than on the plaster surface, avoiding decorative spoiling. Such plasters offer a better solution than dense sand- cement renders when used on moderately salt-contaminated walls as their porous nature gives them insulation properties, resulting in a warmer surface temperature and making condensation problems less likely to occur. However, when used on heavily salt contaminated walls they may need to be replaced frequently as they lose effectiveness once all the pores have become filled with crystallised salt.WTA Merkblatt 2-6-99/D. Endgültige Fassung Juli 2001 - The \\"Renovation Mortars\\" described in EN998-1:2003 are described as being designed for use on \\"moist masonry walls containing soluble salts.\\" The performance requirements for these types of mortars are based on German WTA specification 2-2-91 but without the requirement for a minimum porosity of 40% of total volume. More recently, systems have become available that allow plasterboard or insulation board to be used to replaster walls affected by rising damp. After the existing plaster has been hacked off the wall, a salt and moisture retardant cream is applied to the wall. The plasterboard is then applied to the wall using a salt/moisture-proof adhesive. Such systems have the advantage that they can be decorated straight away, rather than having to wait several days or weeks (as would be the case with standard plasters). They also provide a warmer surface that is less prone to condensation than would be the case with a standard sand:cement render. Replastering may not be necessary where salt contamination is not severe. BS6576:2005 states that \\"Where the plaster appears to be in sound condition, the extent of plaster to be removed may be minimised by delaying any decision to replaster until the drying period is complete.\\" Avoiding the need to replaster in this way can reduce disruption and mess and has the advantage of allowing the original lime or gypsum-based plaster to be maintained. However, the deficiencies of any remedial damp-proof course will be more apparent if the wall is not covered with a waterproof render. For this reason it is important to check the BBA certificate of the damp-proofing system to ensure that it is valid for use where replastering is not being carried out. Redecoration It is best practice to delay replastering and redecoration for as long as possible following rising damp treatment, but this obviously creates inconvenience to the occupants of the affected building. BRE Digest 245 states that \\"While the wall should be allowed to dry for as long as possible, replastering can follow, providing porous decorations are selected. These are usually matt emulsions and water- based paints, both of which will allow the wall to breathe. Application of gloss and vinyl paints or wallpapers should be delayed for at least one year.\\" Plasterboard-based replastering systems have the advantage that immediate redecoration is possible irrespective of which decorative finish is chosen. Due to the fact that rising damp often co-exists with other forms of dampness such as condensation, the use of a mould resistant emulsion paint is often recommended.

The Vienna process used high milling of Hungarian grain, and cereal press-yeast for leavening. History Kaisersemmel or Imperial rollIn the 19th century, for the first time, bread was made only from beer yeast and new dough rather than a sourdough starter. The first known example of this was the sweet-fermented Imperial \\"Kaiser- Semmel\\" roll of the Vienna bakery at the Paris International Exposition of 1867. These sweet-fermented rolls lacked the acid sourness typical of lactobacillus, and were said to be popular and in high demand. Prior to this time, bakers had been using old-dough leavens, and they had discovered that increasing the starter's rest intervals between refreshment promoted more yeast growth and less gas production due to overwhelming lactobacillus numbers. At some point bakers began to add brewer's yeast, or beer yeast or barm, to the refreshments which produced a whiter, sweeter-tasting bread. A shortage of beer yeast for making sweet-fermented breads developed when beer brewers slowly switched from top-fermenting to bottom-fermenting yeast (Saccharomyces pastorianus), and thus the Vienna Process was developed by 1846. In 1845 the Association of Vienna Bakers announced a contest for the production of a sweet-fermenting yeast and the prize was awarded in 1850 to . The Paris Exposition credited the Vienna Bakery in 1867 as the first in the world to use press-yeast. Three types of bakes were exhibited by the Viennese bakery at the exposition: the sweet-fermented Imperial rolls, wheat and rye or solely rye loaves, and a large variety of fancy breads and sweet cakes. The Imperial rolls were made with the finer grades of flour, milk and water in a 50:50 ratio, beer yeast, and salt. Other breads made with the same grades of flour claimed to include: Teacakes, which added butter and may have excluded water in favor of milk; Gipfel or Pinnacle cake, which used milk (no water) and lard; and Brioche, made with milk and sugar. Cereal press yeast Wort in a frothy state of primary fermentation at a modern brewery. The darker brown areas are hops residues. Vienna yeast was propagated utilizing a mash of malted corn, barley, and rye. Horsford did not assert hops were used in the production of press yeast. After pitching a small amount of yeast into the cooled wort, and introducing some air, the propagated yeast floated to the surface. This yeast was collected with some care by skimming. Cool, distilled water was used to wash and settle the yeast a sufficient number of times until only the yeast remained. It was then drained and compressed with the aid of a hydraulic press. Press-yeast was one forerunner to the modern, commercially available baker's yeast. Hungarian high milling Hungarian high milling used a hard or tenacious variety of Hungarian wheat. Their mills were outfitted with both stone and steel-roller mills, and were using a new process that was undoubtedly at the forefront of the technology of the day. This time period marked a changeover from one-pass stone grinding or low milling with its higher damaged starch content, to that of roller milling with greater speed, efficiency, and cooler-temperature operation. A Walz set of roller mills Eben Norton Horsford wrote, Horsford observed that high-milled flour contained less damaged starch, The origins of high milling appeared to be Austria. Horsford attributed the phrase high milling to Vienna grits or ', and which were claimed to be on sale in Berlin as early as 1810. The recognized pioneer was a miller named Ignaz Paur (1778-1842) who by 1810 had moved to Leobersdorf. The demand for these grits was so great, hand sifting them was inadequate, so Paur employed the services of a cabinet maker named Winter to build the first middlings purifier. Paur milled already-separated grits a second time, first making an extract flour locally known as Auszug. Over the course of several decades, these high-milling techniques spread to Hungary, Saxony, and Bohemia, among other areas. In Hungary, the steel cylinder or roller mill, locally known as the Walzenmühle, was first invented, and later improved. The Walz sets kept the grain cooler over multiple passes, as successive pairs of rollers were adjusted to incrementally smaller spacings, the grain moved through cooling air from one pair to the next, each cracked them pass-by-pass into smaller successive bits, instead of crushed between stones in one heat-generating pass. At the Pesth Walzenmühle, when wheat had been fully transformed to flour, it had passed through 18 to 24 pairs of rollers. This new cold milling process, particularly well suited for hard wheat, likely resulted in lighter, more airy breads of greater baked volumes. Steam baking The Vienna bread-production process innovations are often credited for baking with steam leading to different crust characteristics. In 1837, August Zang, a native of Austria, opened a Bakery in Paris called the \\"Boulangerie Viennoise\\" which first introduced steam baking to France, and whose process was described in detail in an entry on Viennese Bread in an 1849 French Industrial Chemistry book: \\"the crust of these breads glazes while baking in an atmosphere of steam, to which effect, one places on the floor of the oven a pile of wet hay, well washed in advance, which produces a cloud of steam.\\" Decades later, another Viennese bakery in Paris introduced the mechanical steam oven, eliminating the need for wet hay, along with cereal press yeast; the United States Government report on the 1867 Universal Exposition details the process used in the \\"Viennese bakery of Mr. Vanner\\", including his use of a steam oven, which by then had become quite popular in France: In the steam oven technique, dough is placed into the oven under a ceiling of steam or, alternatively, the oven is injected with steam as soon as the loaf is loaded. This adds moisture to the body of the bread which delays establishment of the crust and tends to prevent cracking, resulting in a more evenly risen and thinner crust as well as a light and airy crumb. When the steam is turned off, the dry heat of the oven bakes the crust, producing its characteristically slightly crisp and flaky texture. Vienna bread is typically formed as an oblong loaf, but can be baked in other shapes. As a longer loaf, it may well have been the origin of French bread as bakers there attempted to adopt the steam method to produce their baguettes. Some reports in the decades to follow point out that not all Viennese bread is produced in a steam oven. For instance, Horsford, in his 1875 Report on Vienna Bread, wrote: See also * August Zang, an Austrian who opened a Viennese bakery in Paris in the late 1830s, spreading Viennese baking techniques * Austrian cuisine * Charles Louis Fleischmann, the Czech American yeast pioneer who demonstrated Viennese baking at the first American World's Fair in Philadelphia 1876 * List of breads * Mill (grinding) * Proofing (baking technique) * Pumpernickel, an older European style of bread made with steam, but also dark rye and sourdough * Viennoiserie, a French term referring to baked goods in the style of or influenced by Viennese baking References Category:Yeast breads Category:Austrian breads Category:Austrian culture ","title":"Vienna bread"},{"id":"6888389","text":"Santa Fe Railroad Station, home to the Galveston RR Museum The Galveston Railroad Museum is a railroad museum owned and operated by the Center for Transportation and Commerce, a non-profit organization.

The wheat and chessboard problem (sometimes expressed in terms of rice grains) is a mathematical problem expressed in textual form as: The problem may be solved using simple addition. With 64 squares on a chessboard, if the number of grains doubles on successive squares, then the sum of grains on all 64 squares is: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... and so forth for the 64 squares. The total number of grains equals 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (eighteen quintillion four hundred forty-six quadrillion, seven hundred forty-four trillion, seventy-three billion, seven hundred nine million, five hundred fifty-one thousand, six hundred and fifteen)—about 2,000 times annual world production—much more than most expect. This exercise can be used to demonstrate how quickly exponential sequences grow, as well as to introduce exponents, zero power, capital-sigma notation and geometric series. Updated for modern times using pennies and a hypothetical question such as \\"Would you rather have a million dollars or a penny on day one, doubled every day until day 30?\\", the formula has been used to explain compound interest. (Doubling would yield over five million dollars, and twice that the following day.)  Origins  The problem appears in different stories about the invention of chess. One of them includes the geometric progression problem. The story is first known to have been recorded in 1256 by Ibn Khallikan.Clifford A. Pickover (2009), The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, New York : Sterling. . p. 102 Another version has the inventor of chess (in some tellings Sessa, an ancient Indian Minister) request his ruler give him wheat according to the wheat and chessboard problem. The ruler laughs it off as a meager prize for a brilliant invention, only to have court treasurers report the unexpectedly huge number of wheat grains would outstrip the ruler's resources. Versions differ as to whether the inventor becomes a high-ranking advisor or is executed. Macdonnell also investigates the earlier development of the theme. :[According to al- Masudi's early history of India], shatranj, or chess was invented under an Indian king, who expressed his preference for this game over backgammon. [...] The Indians, he adds, also calculated an arithmetical progression with the squares of the chessboard. [...] The early fondness of the Indians for enormous calculations is well known to students of their mathematics, and is exemplified in the writings of the great astronomer Āryabaṭha (born 476 A.D.). [...] An additional argument for the Indian origin of this calculation is supplied by the Arabic name for the square of the chessboard, (بيت, \\"beit\\"), 'house'. [...] For this has doubtless a historical connection with its Indian designation koṣṭhāgāra, 'store-house', 'granary' [...].  Solutions  The simple, brute-force solution is just to manually double and add each step of the series: : T_{64} = 1 + 2 + 4 + ..... + 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 ::where T_{64} is the total number of grains. The series may be expressed using exponents: : T_{64} = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \\\\cdots + 2^{63} and, represented with capital-sigma notation as: :\\\\sum_{i=0}^{63} 2^i.\\\\, It can also be solved much more easily using: : T_{64} = 2^{64}- 1. \\\\, A proof of which is: : s = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \\\\cdots + 2^{63}. Multiply each side by 2: : 2s = 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \\\\cdots + 2^{63} + 2^{64}. Subtract original series from each side: : 2s - s = 2^{64} - 2^0 : \\\\therefore s = 2^{64}- 1. \\\\, The solution above is a particular case of the sum of a geometric series, given by :a + ar + a r^2 + a r^3 + \\\\cdots + a r^{n-1} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k= a \\\\, \\\\frac{1-r^{n}}{1-r}, where a is the first term of the series, r is the common ratio and n is the number of terms. In this problem a = 1, r = 2 and n = 64. The exercise of working through this problem may be used to explain and demonstrate exponents and the quick growth of exponential and geometric sequences. It can also be used to illustrate sigma notation. When expressed as exponents, the geometric series is: 20 + 21 + 22 + 23 + ... and so forth, up to 263. The base of each exponentiation, \\"2\\", expresses the doubling at each square, while the exponents represent the position of each square (0 for the first square, 1 for the second, and so on.). The number of grains is the 64th Mersenne number. Second half of the chessboard An illustration of Ray Kurzweil's second half of the chessboard principle. The letters are abbreviations for the SI metric prefixes. In technology strategy, the \\"second half of the chessboard\\" is a phrase, coined by Ray Kurzweil, in reference to the point where an exponentially growing factor begins to have a significant economic impact on an organization's overall business strategy. While the number of grains on the first half of the chessboard is large, the amount on the second half is vastly (232 > 4 billion times) larger. The number of grains of wheat on the first half of the chessboard is , for a total of 4,294,967,295 (232 − 1) grains, or about 279 tonnes of wheat (assuming 65 mg as the mass of one grain of wheat). The number of grains of wheat on the second half of the chessboard is , for a total of 264 − 232 grains. This is equal to the square of the number of grains on the first half of the board, plus itself. The first square of the second half alone contains one more grain than the entire first half. On the 64th square of the chessboard alone, there would be 263 = 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 grains, more than two billion times as many as on the first half of the chessboard. On the entire chessboard there would be 264 − 1 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 grains of wheat, weighing about 1,199,000,000,000 metric tons. This is about 1,645 times the global production of wheat (729,000,000 metric tons in 2014 and 780.8 million tonnes in 2019). Use Carl Sagan titled the second chapter of his final book The Persian Chessboard and wrote that when referring to bacteria, \\"Exponentials can't go on forever, because they will gobble up everything.\\" Similarly, The Limits to Growth uses the story to present suggested consequences of exponential growth: \\"Exponential growth never can go on very long in a finite space with finite resources.\\"Meadows, Donella H., Dennis L.

Overview   Early Latvian literature  Before there was a written Latvian language, traditions were passed along in folk songs that are still preserved. Before the 19th century, a few authors had started writing poetry and prose (the most important being Gotthard Friedrich Stender). But Latvian literature can be said to have really started only in the nineteenth century, with the book Songs by Juris Alunans, where he wanted to show that deep and noble feelings can also be expressed in Latvian, which the Baltic-German Barons regarded as a peasant tongue. This volume of poetry was published in 1856, the same year as Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal, the starting point of European modernism in poetry. The national epic, Lāčplēsis, published in 1888 was written by Andrejs Pumpurs. In the beginning of the 20th century, mainly through the many German and Russian connections, Latvian literature had diverging movements of symbolism, decadence, and politically – socialism, Marxism, these movements went underground after the defeat of the largest national Latvian uprising the 1905 revolution – and the revenge from the tsarist regime was severe, leading to the first emigration of intellectuals from Latvia. Rainis was a poet, playwright, translator, and politician at the turn of the century; his classic plays \\"Fire and Night\\" (, 1905) and \\"Indulis and Ārija\\" (, 1911) had a profound influence on the literary Latvian language, and the ethnic symbolism he employed in his major works has been central to Latvian nationalism. Rainis was the first to formulate the idea that Latvia could be, not a part of a more democratic Russian Empire – but a sovereign state. He married Aspazija, also a writer, active in the feminist movement. They were exiled to inner Russia from 1897–1903, and lived in Switzerland from 1905–1920. When they returned to an independent Latvia after World War I, Aspazija also joined the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party, and was a member of all sessions of Parliament of Latvia from 1920 to 1934. A writer who similarly to Rainis sought new ways for Latvian literature was Viktors Eglītis. He was influenced by Russian symbolism and came to represent the decadent movement in Latvia. In the early 20th century he aggressively introduced modernist poetics in the country. Later he turned to patriotic historical fiction.  Literature in independent Latvia  In 1918 with the beginning of first period of Independence, there was an amazing activity of modernistic Literature and Arts. Aleksandrs Čaks (real name Čadarainis) glorified the capital city of Riga and its outskirts, romanticizing the everyday side of life, writing of poverty and prostitutes in poetry, which was previously not done. He also wrote an epic poem, \\"Mūžības Skartie\\", dedicated to the Latvian riflemen. In 1949, when Latvia was part of the Soviet Union, Čaks was accused of writing politically incorrect works: the attacks weakened his health, and he died of heart disease on February 8, 1950. Eriks Ādamsons and Vilis Cedriņš, were just beginning to publish at the time of the German takeover. At this time many Latvian writers went into exile, such as Linards Tauns, Gunārs Saliņš, Jānis Sodums, Alfreds Dziļums, Andrejs Eglītis, Velta Sniķere, Gunārs Janovskis. Agate Nesaule wrote of her experiences during this emigration. Among those who were in exile and returned to their homeland after it became independent in 1991 are poets Astrid Ivask, Margarita Gūtmane, Roberts Muks, Andrejs Eglītis, Jānis Sodums.  Latvian Literature after Second World War  After World War II Latvian literary activity was split into three parts – those writers still in Latvia, those in the Gulag's (after two mass-deportations in 1941 and 1949) and writers who had fled to the West. After World War II, for some years the centre of Latvian Literature was Sweden. In the mid 1950s two important things happened: young Latvian exile writers started to publish their works in Stockholm, London, New York – the NY Hell's Kitchen group became the leading one, and secondly, in the Soviet union Nikita Khrushchev revealed the Stalinist-era crimes against humanity at the 20 th congress of the Communist Party in 1956. In literature this led to the so- called 56 generation, and in Latvia there were notable representatives: Ojārs Vācietis, Imants Ziedonis and Vizma Belševica. Valentīns Jākobsons and Knuts Skujenieks had been sent to labor camps in Siberia, and were among those who survived to return and write about their experience, along with Sandra Kalniete, who was born in a Siberian labor camp to Latvian parents and became Latvian Foreign Affairs Minister in 2002. Poets who remained and published in Soviet-controlled Latvia included Vizma Belševica, Imants Ziedonis, Ojārs Vācietis, Māris Čaklais; novelists Zigmunds Skujiņš, Regīna Ezera, Alberts Bels; and a younger generation who grew up during those times, such as poets Klāvs Elsbergs (son of Vizma Belševica), Uldis Bērziņš, Amanda Aizpuriete, Pēters Brūveris, Anna Auziņa, Knuts Skujenieks, Māris Melgalvs. Māra Zālīte, who once wrote poetry, has written musicals for the past years. Latgalian writers include Jānis Klīdzējs, Anna Rancāne, Oskars Seiksts, Valentīns Lukaševičs, Ingrida Tārauda, Laima Muktupāvela and others. Recently the new writers have been writing in two and three languages, with texts in Russian or English appearing alongside texts in the Latvian or Latgalian literary languages. Every year the latest Latgalian is published in a Latgalian Literary almanac. Since 1990 books written in the Latgalian literary language have been published mainly by the Publishing House of the Culture Centre of Latgale, run by Jānis Elksnis (Rēzekne). First-generation children born to Latvian parents in exile who became writers include Sven Birkerts, poet Juris Kronbergs and Margita Gūtmane. The youngest generation of Latvian writers includes Inga Ābele, poet, novelist and playwright; poets Edvīns Raups, Andris Akmentiņš, Pēteris Draguns, Eduards Aivars, Liana Langa, Anna Auziņa, Kārlis Vērdiņš, Marts Pujāts and Inga Gaile; prose writers include Pauls Bankovskis, Jānis Einfelds, Gundega Repše, Andra Neiburga, Laima Muktupāvela, Kristīne Ulberga and Nora Ikstena. The Latvian Literature Center was founded in 2002 to foster international recognition of and access to Latvian fiction, poetry, plays and children's literature.

The album showed a big change of musical direction, and was described in The Guardian as \\"drawing on electro, rock and roots music, but remaining resolutely pop in its approach and execution, the record has a vitality and adventurousness that puts most of Poland's alt-rock acts to shame\\". Granda was certified double platinum in Poland in November 2011. LAX EP (2012) In May 2012, Brodka released an extended play LAX, which was recorded at Red Bull Studios in Los Angeles together with music producer and engineer Bartosz Dziedzic.

Legacy Nasiruddin Chiragh Dehalvi, unlike his spiritual master Nizamuddin Auliya, did not listen to sema, which was considered un-Islamic by a section of the Muslim intelligentsia in that period. He did not however pass any specific judgement against it. This is the reason why even today, qawwali is not performed near his shrine in Delhi.

The channel was promoted under the slogan \\"The Channel For Living\\". Now was broadcast throughout BSB's short spell on air from March to December 1990 on the Marcopolo satellites. In November 1990, BSB merged with Sky to form British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB). BSkyB decided to streamline the channels available on both services. Now was replaced with Sky News, which Sky Television had broadcast on the Astra 1A satellite. Now ceased broadcasting on Saturday 1 December 1990 at 1am - the first of the five BSB channels to close. As there were still arts programmes yet to be shown on Now, BSkyB initially broadcast Sky Arts as a weekend-only opt-out of the Sky News service on the Marcopolo satellite. Once all shows were broadcast, Sky Arts closed. Programming Now featured a mix of talk and chat shows, documentaries, news, current affairs and arts programming. As with all of BSB's other channels, Now carried short BSB News bulletins throughout the day. One of Now's most memorable programmes was Now Sir Robin fronted by ex-Question Time presenter Sir Robin Day, which later transferred to Sky News. The programme covered the week's political happenings and confrontations. Now broadcast a number of theatre and classical music performances during its short period on-air.

It was located at 5570 South Kenansville Road, next to SR 60. On January 3, 1994, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.  History  In the 1930s, the spot was originally named \\"Jackass Crossing,\\" a reference to the burros that ranchers rode to Desert Inn. As early as 1889, the Desert Inn was a bar room and brothel for cowboys and lumber workers. The Desert Inn did not have full- service water and electricity until 1978. Throughout the years, the Desert Inn was used as a trading post, gas station, and dance hall. In 1994, after being added to the National Register of Historic Places, the unused rooms above the restaurant were converted into a modest museum that featured a bordello suite with red carpet, lace pillows and a swing. The Desert Inn closed in June 2018. In the early morning hours of December 22, 2019, a tractor trailer crashed into the side of the inn. The trailer jackknifed and photos show the roof of the inn collapsed onto the roof of the tractor trailer. The President of the Osceola County Historical Society, which owns and operated the Desert Inn, stated that a determination will be made if any part of the building can be saved pending a survey by a structural engineer. Fortunately, a few weeks prior, valuable artifacts from inside the Desert Inn were removed and put in their archives as part of a clean up day and restoration efforts.

Situated in the Georgian/Victorian suburb of Clifton, Bristol, it provides self-catering accommodation for around 340 residents, both in the main hall itself and also in a number of nearby surrounding annexes. The majority of residents are first year undergraduate students, but a number of 'returners' choose to stay on to contribute to the hall's life and community in subsequent years of study. The hall has a number of student run organisations associated with it, the largest of which is the Junior Common Room which all current undergraduates residents are members of, with an elected committee of representatives being responsible for organising social events throughout the year. In addition to the Junior Common Room residents are supported pastorally by a team of Senior Residents who, along with a number of honorary members, make up the Senior Common Room. After leaving the hall many of its former residents remain in touch via its alumni network: the Manor Hall Association, which organises a number of events throughout the year aimed at both current and former residents. The Main Hall Entrance to Manor Hall viewed from Tottenham Place A view of the front of Manor Hall taken from within its gardens The main hall was erected between 1927 and 1932 as a women's hall of residence in the grounds of its present annex Manor House, from which the Hall takes its name. The hall owes its existence to the late Henry Herbert Wills and was designed by the leading neo-classical architect Sir George Oatley, who also designed the Wills Memorial Building and Wills Hall; both of which also belong to the University. When the hall opened in 1932 a number of smaller residences for women: Belgrave House, Elton House, Heathside and Royal Park, were closed and their residents moved to the new building. The first warden, Mrs Jessie D. Skemp was the former Warden of Belgrave House and the widow of the Professor of English who was killed during the Great War. The gardens were laid out by Hiatt Cowells Baker in 1934 and are occasionally opened to the public. The building is symmetrical, consisting of East and West facing sides, with a single corridor of student rooms occupying each floor. It houses around 140 students and includes a library, computer room, bar, common room, music room and laundry facilities.the Stops Gallery, outside the Great Hall, contains a number of works by local artists including Warren Storey RWA and H.John Stops, RWA. In July 2012 the hall was closed for the most significant refurbishment in its history including upgrades to the heating system, kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms and communal areas. It reopened in September 2013 with the official celebrations being held on 7 June 2014. Annexes In addition to the main hall, Manor Hall comprises a number of smaller annexes located within its grounds and on nearby streets. These buildings, as with the main hall, have a rich history; with the oldest dating back as far as 18th century. Manor House This annex came to the University in 1919, again as a gift from the Wills family and was furnished partly from funds raised by concerts given by the famous Bristol contralto Dame Clara Butt. The building was erected close to the site of the medieval manor house burned by Prince Rupert’s men in 1643 during the Storming of Bristol. Purchased by the Society of Merchant Venturers in the late 17th century the site remained ruinous for many years. On 17 September 1700 the Society mandated that \\"a lease for five lives was granted to Whitchurch Phippen of the site or ruins of the Great House at Clifton heretofore burnt down and since called the Old Castle, late in the holding of Mary Hodges\\". The new manor house was built in the early 18th century and extensively altered and extended in the mid-18th and 19th centuries. The terrace contains Roman remains, parts of a column, which are believed to have been brought back from the Mediterranean by a former resident in the eighteenth century. In the 19th century it was successively the home of the notable scientists Dr William Budd FRS, who discovered the origins of typhoid, and Professor John Beddoe FRS, the social anthropologist who wrote The Races of Man. In the 1890s the house became a school preparing young gentlemen for colonial civil service examinations and for the army and navy. The school closed in 1915 and the house became the home of The Red Maids' School, which was evacuated from Westbury while their buildings were used as a Red Cross Hospital during the Great War. Richmond House Sinclair House Richmond House is one of the oldest houses in Clifton having been built between 1701-1703 For Whitchurch Phippen a Mercer of Bristol on the site of the medieval manor house burned during the Civil War, which had once been the home of Richard Amerike. The building is an English Heritage Grade II listed building. Amerike sponsored the explorer John Cabot, who sailed from Bristol in 1497 and discovered Newfoundland and is now believed by some scholars to have given his patronymic to name the continent of America. In the 1790s the house was used as a boarding school for young gentlemen run by a Mr William Sewell. From the 1860s until the 1940s the house was the home of the Revd. and Mrs. Thomas Smith and their large family of maiden daughters, one of whom, Miss Emily Harriet Smith, became one of the first women to sit on the city council in 1920 and one of the first female Justice of the Peace. A noted horsewoman, the site of her former stables is now occupied, in part, by Sinclair House.She spent much of the winters abroad and her house was let in her absence. One of the many long standing residents was the Revd. Alfred Ainger, biographer of Charles Lamb and friend of Dickens, who resided here each year for the duration of his turn as residentiary canon of Bristol Cathedral, together with his niece and their dog. Sinclair House Sinclair House was built partly on the site of Holland Cottage which were destroyed during the German air raids of November 1940. Opened in 1978, the building is named after the Lady Sinclair of Cleeve, who was involved in the affairs of the University for many years and served on the hall advisory committee of Manor Hall until her death. The building consists of twelve flats, each housing five students, and ten ground floor flats for overseas postgraduate students and their families. The British Council contributed to the project on the understanding that preference would be given to students from the Commonwealth, or to those on British Council Scholarships. Richmond Terrace Richmond Terrace was originally a row of spacious townhouses constructed in the 1780s as part of the building boom of Clifton in between wars with France. 30-35 Richmond Terrace was a hotel prior before being acquired by the University in 2006. The building underwent a major refurbishment and it now provides self-catered en suite accommodation for 92 students. It was previously managed by University Student Houses and became a Manor Hall annexe in 2012. 115 Queen's Road 115 Queen's Road is Manor Hall's newest annex, having been one of Clifton Hill House's annexes up until 2017.

He is the longest serving Warden in the history of University College, Bristol, and the University of Bristol, since the first Warden was appointed in 1893 and he served successively as Senior and Head Warden of the University. Former Wardens * 1932-1945: Mrs. Jessie D. Skemp M.A., (1882-1961), * 1946-1956: Miss Gladys M. Morgan, M.A.,(1894-1957)., * 1956-1968: Mrs. Marjorie Tait, JP., B.A., Ph.D.,(1908-1972) * 1968-1974: Miss Audrey N. M. Rich, M.A. * 1974-1984: Miss Sheila B. Brennan, M.A., (1922-2006) Student life All current undergraduate residents are members of the hall's Junior Common Room with a Junior Common Room Committee being elected annually at the beginning of the Summer Term from amongst the residents and is responsible for organising many of the social and recreational activities in the hall, including the Freshers’ Welcome at the start of the academic year, sporting activities, hall 'formals' (dinner followed by various entertainments), and the annual garden party. In addition to the Junior Common Room the hall has several student societies established exclusively for its residents including a Music and Drama Society, Debating Society, Club Bar, Christian Union and Charity Committee, the latter being involve in year round fundraising activities for a number of charities to which the hall has a close association. Annual traditions at Manor Hall includes the running of two musical/dramatic productions a year, three formal dinners, and a garden party to celebrate the end of the academic year in addition to other events that are run throughout the year. Music and Drama Society The Manor Hall Amateur Dramatics Society, known as 'MAD', was formed in October 1933. Its first production was a nativity play, The Child in Flanders, by Cicely Hamilton, which was performed on 8 December 1933. Recent productions include Mostellaria, And Then There Were None, Road, The Crucible and The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole. Manor Hall Association Students who have lived in the hall for one academic term are entitled to join the Manor Hall Association, which acts at the hall's alumni network, to help former residents keep in contact with one another and the hall community. The Association is responsible for the organisation of the annual Summer Ball, usually held to celebrate the achievements of that years graduands, in 2014 the Summer Ball also served as the official celebrations for the hall's 80th anniversary, two years after the fact due to the refurbishment works taking place in the main building during the 2012/13 session of the University. The Association itself has a long history, and in fact predates Manor Hall being originally formed in 1925 as the ‘Elton House Old Students’ Association’ by Winifred Armstead. In 1932, when the ladies from Elton House relocated to the newly built Manor Hall, the Association was renamed accordingly. The Association is run by a committee of volunteers and was wound up pro tem in 2005 due to incumbent committee growing too old to continue its work with members being transferred to the Wills Hall Association until such a time as new officers could be found to continue its work. In 2007, the decision was taken that its work should continue and that alumni of the Hall should have an effective mechanism to keep in touch with the Manor Hall and each other. As such the Association was brought out of abeyance in December 2007 with Christopher Didcote acting as its first Chairman. Elton House Award Each year the Association presents up to two of its members with the Elton House Award for outstanding contribution to the Manor Hall Community. The award itself was established in 2008 to not only mark the recent reformation of the Association but as a way of recognising the often considerable time and effort select individuals invest into the life of the hall. The name is taken from Elton House, one of the student hostels that Manor Hall was built to replace in 1932 and from where the predecessor of the Manor Hall Association took its name. Winners of the award receive three years' honorary membership of the Association, a certificate and an Elton House Award pin. The presentation usually takes place during the Association's Summer Ball. The MHA Fund In 2012, the Association would set up a charitable fund for the use of Manor Hall and its residents. The aim of this fund being to provide financial support to either the Hall or any of its student run committees. The fund is operated on an application basis with the Association reviewing legitimate applications for finance from those currently involved in the life of the Hall for the acquisition of assets that will provide some tangible benefit to the Hall and future generations of students who reside there. Fundraising activities are conducted throughout the year, usually in the form of prize raffles at hall events. Crest, motto and tie The hall crest is divided into two halves. The upper half is described heraldically as \\"gules, a sun in splendour\\" or a golden sun. The late Sir John Wills, Bart. of Langford Court, Somerset, grandson of the Sir George Wills who purchased Manor House for the University, gave his permission for this motif to be taken from his family's coat of arms and used as part of the badge of the hall. The University also took the \\"sun in splendour\\" from the coat of arms of the Wills family when it was granted its coat of arms in 1909. The lower half is a serpent, \\"nowed\\" or coiled. This is a grass snake, and comes from the crest of the Wolstenholme family of Neston. Co. Chester, and Liverpool from whom the current Warden is descended. The serpent is traditionally a symbol of wisdom, healing and learning. The hall motto comes from Matthew 10:16, \\"Estote ergo prudentes sicut serpentes, et simplices sicut columbae\\", (be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves). The hall tie has the golden sun of the Wills family placed on a red background. The red is the shade known as Bristol or \\"Bristowe\\" red, chosen by the founders of the University for the hoods of all Bristol graduates. \\"Bristowe Red\\" is supposed to recall the famous dye used in Mediaeval Bristol, but in fact Sir Isambard Owen, the Vice Chancellor from 1909 to 1921, took the shade from a band of limestone in the Avon Gorge.

It developed the first commercial white water rafting operation in the UK in 1986, and since then has grown to become the largest and most well-respected rafting organisation in the UK. The centre is home to paddlesport National Governing Body Canoe Wales. The National White Water Centre is ideal for canoeing, kayaking, play-boating and coached groups who sometimes run BCU/CW Star Awards. The River Tryweryn The Tryweryn is a river in north Wales. It flows from Llyn Celyn in the Snowdonia National Park and after 19 km joins the river Dee at Bala. It is one of the main tributaries of the Dee and has been dammed to form Llyn Celyn. Water is stored in winter when flows are high, and released over the summer to maintain the flow in the Dee, meaning that the river often has suitable water levels for kayakers and rafters at time of year when natural rivers throughout Wales may be too low. Usually between 9 and 12 m³/s are released by the dam. The whitewater rapids have been modified by placing boulders in strategic points along the course of the river to create eddys, drops and play spots. Access to the centre requires payment for both commercial and non-commercial users. The river is generally split into three sections: Top Site, Centre Section and the Lower Tryweryn. Top Site This constitutes the section of river leading from the setting basin below the Llyn Celyn dam along to the chipper (a metal fish trap, so called because it resembles a chip-slicer). The chipper is actually a fish-trap. The chipper screens were removed on the 13th of November 2019. This section is a nice Grade II coming onto III, with a good play-hole (the \\"Top-Hole\\") and a playful weir. The section is often used for safety and rescue courses, as well as kayaking freestyle competitions. Officially there is no raft or canoe access to this top section. The Centre Section This section (commonly known as the \\"Upper Tryweryn\\") is the main part of the Tryweryn, it runs for approximately 2 km from the chipper down to the Tyn Cornel camping site, and is a good Grade III. It contains most of the main features of the river (in order of occurrence): * The Graveyard * The Ski Jump * Fedwr Gog Falls (aka Miss Davis' Bridge, or 'Stone' bridge), * Café Wave * Fingers * NRA (National Rivers Authority) Bridge * Chapel Falls The Lower Tryweryn Running the 4 km from the Tyn Cornel campsite down to Bala, this is a good Grade II bordering on Grade III section which finishes spectacularly at Bala Mill Falls (an easily portaged Grade IV rapid). This section is not managed like the upper Tryweryn, although the centre has been known to remove fallen trees and other obstructions/hazards quickly.

As an example, consider a photograph of a white wedding dress against a white background. With limited highlight headroom, it will be hard to appreciate the intricate details within the fabric of the dress. The higher the available headroom, the more subtle shades of white will be captured. In practice, photographers are often faced with photographing outdoors on a cloudy day, but with the sun shining through a gap onto the subjects forehead. This can often lead to a bright reflection which records as bright white. If this bright spot (called a highlight) lies at the edge of the persons outline (from the camera's perspective) then it may end up blending into the cloudy sky if there is insufficient highlight headroom. This is a particular problem with digital cameras which often have a smaller dynamic range than film. Digital sensors typically have an abrupt cut- off at the peak white level; sensor output typically increases linearly with incident light level until a peak white level, after which higher light levels result in the same peak output from the sensor. The response of film when the incident light is near the white level of the film is more gradual.

It is run at Longchamp over a distance of 2,400 metres (about 1½ miles), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September. The race serves as a trial for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, which is held at the same venue three weeks later. History A precursor of the race called the Prix de Chantilly was formerly staged at Chantilly in early September. It was open to horses aged three or older, and for a period its distance was 3,100 metres. It was subsequently transferred to Longchamp and run over 3,000 metres. It was shortened to 2,400 metres in 1952, and reduced to 2,300 metres in 1953. The Prix de Chantilly was restricted to three-year- olds when a separate event was introduced for older horses in 1955. The new race was initially titled the Prix Henri Foy, and from this point the Prix de Chantilly was contested over 2,400 metres. The race was cut to 2,000 metres in 1960, and restored to 2,400 metres the following year. It was switched to Chantilly in 1964, and returned to Longchamp with a length of 2,100 metres in 1966. It was extended to 2,200 metres in 1968. The event was renamed in memory of Gaston Niel (1880–1970), a long-serving member of the Société d'Encouragement, in 1972. For several years the Prix Niel held Group 3 status. It was increased to 2,400 metres in 1979, and promoted to Group 2 level in 1987. The Prix Niel became part of the Breeders' Cup Challenge series in 2010, with the winner earning an automatic invitation to compete in the Breeders' Cup Turf. It was removed from the series in 2012. Twelve winners of the race have achieved victory in the same year's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. The first was Sica Boy in 1954, and the most recent Rail Link in 2006.

With the chemical formula C6H4(CO2C4H9)2, it is a colorless oil, although commercial samples are often yellow.Peter M. Lorz, Friedrich K. Towae, Walter Enke, Rudolf Jäckh, Naresh Bhargava, Wolfgang Hillesheim \\"Phthalic Acid and Derivatives\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2007, Wiley- VCH, Weinheim. Production and use DBP is produced by the reaction of n-butanol with phthalic anhydride. These precursor compounds are produced cleanly and cheaply. DBP is an important plasticizer that allows major engineering plastics, such as PVC, to be used. Such modified PVC is widely used in plumbing for carrying sewerage and other corrosive materials. Degradation Hydrolysis Monobutyl phthalate (MBP) is its major metabolite. Double saponification of DBP leads to phthalic acid and 1-butanol. In landfills DBP has a low vapor pressure of 2.67 x 10−3 Pa. Thus DBP does not evaporate readily (hence its utility as a plasticizer). I Henry’s Law constant is 8.83 x 10−7 atm-m3/mol. As reflected by its octanol-water partition coefficient of around 4, it is lipophilic, which means that it is not readily mobilized (dissolved by) water. Nonetheless dissolved organic compounds (DOC) increase its mobility in landfills. Biodegradation Biodegradation by microorganisms represents one route for remediation of pollution by DBP. For example, Enterobacter species can biodegrade municipal solid waste—where the DBP concentration can be observed at 1500 ppm—with a half-life of 2–3 hours. In contrast, the same species can break down 100% of dimethyl phthalate after a span of six days. The white rot fungus Polyporus brumalis degrades DBP. Legislation DBP is also a putative endocrine disruptor. European Union The use of this substance in cosmetics, including nail polishes, is banned in the European Union under Directive 76/768/EEC 1976.EU Council Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products The use of DBP has been restricted in the European Union for use in children's toys since 1999.Ban of phthalates in childcare articles and toys, press release IP/99/829, 10 November 1999 An EU Risk Assessment has been conducted on DBP and the final outcome has now been published in the EU Official Journal. To eliminate a potential risk to plants in the vicinity of processing sites and workers through inhalation, measures are to be taken within the framework of the IPPC Directive (96/61/EC) and the Occupational Exposure Directive (98/24/EC) Also includes the 2004 addendum. Based on urine samples from people of different ages, the European Commission Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) concluded that total exposures to DBP should be further reduced. Under European Union Directive 2011/65/EU Directive 2011/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment Text with EEA relevance revision 2015/863 Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2015/863 of 31 March 2015 amending Annex II to Directive 2011/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of restricted substances (commonly known as RoHS 3), DBP is limited to max 1000 ppm concentration in any homogenous material. United States Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is one of the six phthalic acid esters found on the Priority Pollutant List, which consists of pollutants regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). DBP is leached from landfills. However, due to the fact that DBP has a density less than that of water, a thin surface film forms at the air-water interface. DBP was added to the California Proposition 65 (1986) list of suspected teratogens in November 2006. It is a suspected endocrine disruptor. It was used in many consumer products, e.g., nail polish, but such usages has declined since around 2006. It was banned in children's toys, in concentrations of 1000 ppm or greater, under section 108 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA). An example of DBP’s endocrine disruption is shown in one study, in which pregnant female rats were exposed to varying doses of DBP orally from gestational day 12.5 to 21.5.^([19]) Results showed that DBP down regulates the expression of BcI-2 (inhibit apoptosis) and up-regulates the expression of Bax (promote apoptosis) in male offspring, decreasing the BcI-2/Bax ratio.^([19]) This results in the increase of apoptosis in the seminiferous tubule cells early in male rat development. In these male offpsrings, in-utero expression of DBP resulted in decreased anal-genital distance, decreased Sertoli cell and Leydig cell number in seminiferous tubule, and decreased sperm production.Ma, T., Yin, X., Han, R., Ding, J., Zhang, H., Han, X., & Li, D.

Kaija Siren graduated as an architect from the Helsinki University of Technology in 1948. She and her husband Heikki Siren set up their own architectural office in 1949. The Sirens worked together as architects their entire life. The Otaniemi Chapel is noted for its delicate balance between features of Finnish rural architecture and a modernism, influenced by Alvar Aalto's redbrick period of the 1950s. Their later work is noted for its monumentality. She is buried in the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki.

It is run at Longchamp over a distance of 2,400 metres (about 1½ miles), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September. The race serves as a trial for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, which is held at the same venue three weeks later. History The event is named in memory of Henri Foy (1872–1954), a long-serving member of the Société d'Encouragement, a former governing body of horse racing in France. It was established in 1955, and originally called the Prix Henri Foy. The race was initially contested over 2,300 metres, and for a period it was open to horses aged three or older. It was cut to 2,200 metres in 1961, and the minimum age was raised to four in 1967. Its title was shortened to the Prix Foy in 1969. The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the Prix Foy was given Group 3 status. It was subsequently run on the same day as the Prix Niel, a similar event restricted to three-year-olds. The race was extended to 2,400 metres in 1979. It was promoted to Group 2 level in 1998. Three winners of the Prix Foy have achieved victory in the same year's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe – Allez France (1974), Sagace (1984) and Waldgeist (2019). Three horses have won the Arc after being defeated in this event – Gold River (1981), All Along (1983) and Subotica (1992).

The word French \\"veneur\\" (huntsman), derives from the Middle French word \\"vener\\" (to hunt), (itself from the Latin venor, verb meaning to hunt), from which also was derived the archaic English words \\"venerer\\" (hunter) and \\"venery\\" (the hunt). The position is sometimes grouped with the Great Officers of the Crown of France. The position was one of the \\"Great Offices of the Maison du Roi\\". The position was equivalent to that of the \\"Grand Master of the Hunt\\" in certain European royal households. The Grand Veneur was responsible for the royal hunt. The title was created in 1413 by Charles VI at roughly the same time as those of Grand Falconer of France and the \\"Capitaine du vautrait\\". The Grand Veneur took care of the king's hunting dogs (roughly 100 hounds) for the stag hunt. Under Charles VIII, he oversaw nine squires (écuyers), nine huntsmen (veneurs), two aides, six valets for the hounds (valets de limiers) and one dog handler for the foxhounds. The service gained even greater prestige under Francis I and Henry II, and the position reached a high point under Henry IV; in 1596, 182 persons were employed by the royal hunt, which included lieutenants, sous-lieutenants, gentlemen, valets for the hounds, mounted and unmounted valets for the dogs, and finally a surgeon and an apothecary. The Grand Veneur was the most important of all the royal offices dealing with the hunt. In the 16th century, the house of Guise held the position five times. In the 17th century, the family Rohan-Montbazon held it three times. At the beginning of the 18th century, the position was given by Louis XIV to Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, Comte de Toulouse, one of his legitimized children, who, in turn, passed it on to his son Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, duc de Penthièvre. From the 16th century, the holder of the position received an annual salary of 1200 livres, which was a relatively small sum within the royal household. The Grand Veneur also received additional revenues (up to 10,000 livres). According to Saint-Simon, in 1714, the new Duke de La Rochefoucauld sold, for a sum of 500,000 livres. his office of Grand Veneur, which he had just inherited upon the death of his father. Up to a point, the Grand Veneur de France position is comparable to the one of Master of the Buckhounds in the English monarchy.

A five-star rank is a very senior military rank, first established in the United States in 1944, with a five-star general insignia,Oxford English Dictionary (OED), 2nd Edition, 1989. \\"five\\" ... \\"five-star adj., ... (b) U.S., applied to a general or admiral whose badge of rank includes five stars;\\" and corresponding ranks in other countries. The rank is that of the most senior operational military commanders, and within NATO's \\"standard rank scale\\" it is designated by the code OF-10. Not all armed forces have such a rank, and in those that do the actual insignia of the \\"five-star ranks\\" may not contain five stars. For example: the insignia for the French OF-10 rank maréchal de France contains 7 stars; the insignia for the Portuguese marechal contains four gold stars; and many of the insignia of the ranks in the Commonwealth of Nations contain no stars at all. Typically, five-star officers hold the rank of general of the army, admiral of the fleet, field marshal, marshal or general of the air force, and several other similarly named ranks. \\"Five-star\\" ranks are extremely senior—usually the highest ranks. As an active rank, the position exists only in a minority of countries and is usually held by only a very few officers during wartime. In times of peace, it is usually held only as an honorary rank. Traditionally, five-star ranks are granted to distinguished military commanders for notable wartime victories and/or in recognition of a record of achievement during the officer's career, whether in peace or in war. Alternatively, a five-star rank (or even higher ranks) may be assumed by heads of state in their capacities as commanders-in-chief of their nation's armed forces. Despite the rarity and seniority of five-star officers, even more-senior ranks have been adopted in the United States, namely, admiral of the navy and general of the armies. Other names for highly senior ranks from the twentieth century include généralissime (France), generalissimo (Spain) and generalissimus (USSR). Australia *Admiral of the fleetThe Australian insignia for admiral of the fleet, field marshal and marshal of the Royal Australian Air Force, depending on the era, are either identical to, or very similar to, the British insignia. Currently, Prince Philip is the only holder of these Australian ranks. Note that although the highest active New Zealand rank is three-star, (there are no New Zealand four-star rank holders), Prince Philip holds five-star ranks in the New Zealand Armed Forces. *Field marshal *Marshal of the Royal Australian Air Force Only one Australian-born officer, Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey, has held a substantive Australian five-star rank. Lord Birdwood, who commanded the Australian Imperial Force in the First World War, was appointed to honorary five-star rank in the Australian Military Forces on his promotion to field marshal in the British Army in 1925. King George VI and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh have held all three Australian five-star ranks in an honorary capacity, and have been the only holders of the Australian ranks of admiral of the fleet and marshal of the RAAF.

However, as government regulation No. 32/1997 have been revoked and replaced by government regulation No. 39/2010, whereas the latest regulation don't mentioned five-star rank. Therefore, it is unlikely there will be any Indonesian military personnel to be awarded five-star rank.

Promotion to the rank of field marshal was generally stopped in 1995 as a cost-cutting measure but is still made in some cases. The most recent appointments to five-star ranks are the promotions in 2012 of the Prince of Wales to honorary five-star rank in all three services, and of former Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank to the honorary rank of field marshal. In 2014 the former Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Stirrup was promoted to the honorary rank of marshal of the Royal Air Force. During World War II and after, serving NATO, a small number of British five-star commanders have held the additional title Supreme Allied Commander, given operational control over all air, land, and sea units led by the four-star commanders of multi-national forces. United States *Fleet Admiral (held by four officers) *General of the Army (held by five officers) *General of the Air Force (held by one officer) Before the five-star ranks were established in 1944, two officers had previously been promoted from their four-star ranks to the superior and unique ranks of Admiral of the Navy and General of the Armies: Admiral George Dewey (appointment 1903 retroactive to 1899, died 1917) and General John J. Pershing (appointed 1919, died 1948). In 1944 the Navy and Army specified that these officers were considered senior to any officers promoted to the five-star ranks within their services (but it was not clear if they were senior by rank or by seniority due to an earlier date of rank). Five-star ranks were created in the U.S. military during World War II because of the awkward situation created when some American senior commanders were placed in positions commanding allied officers of higher rank. U.S. officers holding five-star rank never retire; they draw full active duty pay for life. The five-star ranks were retired in 1981 on the death of General of the Army Omar Bradley. Nine Americans have been promoted to five-star rank, one of them, Henry H. Arnold, in two services (U.S. Army then later in the U.S. Air Force). As part of the bicentennial celebration, George Washington was, 177 years after his death, permanently made senior to all other U.S. generals and admirals with the title General of the Armies effective on 4 July 1976. The appointment stated he was to have \\"rank and precedence over all other grades of the Army, past or present\\". The following Americans have been promoted to five-star rank: {  • Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy 15 December 1944 -  • General of the Army George Marshall 16 December 1944 -  • Fleet Admiral Ernest King 17 December 1944 -  • General of the Army Douglas MacArthur 18 December 1944 -  • Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz 19 December 1944 -  • General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower 20 December 1944 -  • General of the Army & Air Force Henry H. Arnold 21 December 1944 & 7 May 1949 -  • Fleet Admiral William Halsey, Jr. 11 December 1945 -  • General of the Army Omar Bradley 20 September 1950 -  • General of the Armies George Washington 4 July 1976, with an effective appointment date of 4 July 1776 } The timing of the first seven appointments was to establish both a clear order of seniority and a near-equivalence between the Army and Navy services. In 1949, Arnold was honored by being made the first, and to date only, general of the air force. He is the only American to serve in a five- star rank in two of its military services. By a Congressional Act of 24 March 1903, Admiral George Dewey's rank was established as admiral of the navy, a rank which was specified to be senior to the four-star rank of admiral and was equal to admiral of the fleet in the British Royal Navy. Admiral Dewey was the only individual ever appointed to this rank, which lapsed with his death on 16 January 1917. Admiral of the navy was considered superior to fleet admiral during World War II. On 3 September 1919, John Pershing was promoted to the rank of General of the Armies (officially General of the Armies of the United States) in recognition of his service during World War I. He is the only person promoted to this rank during their lifetime. : During the United States Bicentennial year, George Washington was posthumously appointed to the grade of General of the Armies of the United States by the congressional joint resolution Public Law 94-479 passed on 19 January 1976, with an effective appointment date of 4 July 1976 but having rank and precedence over all other grades of the Army, past or present. This restored Washington's position as the most senior U.S. military officer. Between the joint resolution concerning Washington's rank, the fact that Omar Bradley was still alive, and thus still considered to be on active duty, and statements made and actions taken during and after World War II about the relationship between General of the Armies and General of the Army, it appears General of the Armies is superior in rank to General of the Army. : No official law or regulation established exact seniority or reciprocity between Admiral of the Navy Dewey, and Generals of the Armies Washington and Pershing. While Congress clearly indicated that Washington was senior to Pershing, and also all other \\"officers of the United States Army,\\" and by decades of custom Pershing was considered senior to all 5-star and other 4-star generals of the U.S. Army, nowhere is Dewey's exact seniority established. As Washington was explicitly made senior only to Pershing and other officers of the U.S. Army, ambiguity remains whether Admiral Dewey, with a date of rank as early as 1899 above a 4-star, and senior to all later 5-stars, is not actually senior to Washington by date of rank, and by operation of naval custom making Dewey senior to all 5-stars. As Dewey died (and his rank died with him) before Pershing was appointed to his final rank, and the Army and Navy were far more independent before the creation of the Department of Defense unified them, this could indicate Admiral of the Navy Dewey, not General of the Armies Washington, is actually the most senior ranking U.S. military officer in U.S. history. By definition, officers of each Armed Force rank amongst themselves by seniority. And when they serve with other Armed Services (Army and Navy, for example), they rank amongst themselves by date of rank notwithstanding their parent Service. In the case of Dewey, he is undisputedly the senior most Navy officer ever to have served in the U.S. Navy, and he had nearly 20 years of seniority over Pershing as a \\"special rank, above 4-star.\\" Washington's own, revised, date of rank in 1976 does not precede Dewey's date of rank nearly 75 years before, nor did Congress describe in unambiguous wording that Washington was -- in fact -- senior to all officers of the U.S. Army, as well as all other U.S. Armed Forces including the U.S. Navy.

This is the origin of the term Ricardian rent. Ricardo's formulation of the law was the first clear exposition of the source and magnitude of rent, and is among the most important and firmly established principles of economics. John Stuart Mill called it the \\"pons asinorum\\" of economics.  Description  The law of rent states that the rent of a land site is equal to the economic advantage obtained by using the site in its most productive use, relative to the advantage obtained by using marginal (i.e., the best rent-free) land for the same purpose, given the same inputs of labor and capital. Ricardo formulated this law based on the principles put forth by Adam Smith in Wealth of Nations. > \\"The rent of land, therefore, considered as the price paid for the use of > the land, is naturally a monopoly price. It is not at all proportioned to > what the landlord may have laid out upon the improvement of the land, or to > what he can afford to take; but to what the farmer can afford to give.\\" — > Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, > Book I, Chapter XI \\"Of the Rent of Land\\" Ricardian rent should not be confused with contract rent, which is the \\"actual payments tenants make for use of the properties of others.\\" (Barlow 1986). Rather, the law of rent refers to the economic return that land should accrue for its use in production. Being a political economist, Ricardo was not simply referring to land in terms of soil. He was primarily interested in the economic rent and locational value associated with private appropriation of any natural factor of production. The law of rent applies equally well to urban land and rural land, as it is a fundamental principle of economics. Ricardo noticed that the bargaining power of laborers can never dip below the produce obtainable on the best available rent-free land, because whenever rent leaves them with less than they could get on that free land, they can simply move to the new location. The produce obtainable on the best available rent- free land is known as the margin of production. Since landlords have a monopoly over a given location, the only limiting factor for rent is the margin of production. Thus, rent is a differential between the productive capacity of the land and the margin of production. Note that Ricardo's original formulation assumes that the best quality land would be the first to be used in production, and that goods are sold in a competitive, single price market.

Background He was born Armar Lowry, the first son of Galbraith Lowry (later Lowry-Corry) MP, of Ahenis, County Tyrone by his wife Sarah Corry, second daughter and eventual co-heiress of Colonel John Corry, MP, of Castle Coole, County Fermanagh. Public life In 1768, Lowry was elected to the Irish House of Commons for Tyrone and sat for the constituency until 1781, when he was elevated to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Belmore, of Castle Coole in the County of Fermanagh. On 6 December 1789 he was further created Viscount Belmore and on 20 November 1797 was created Earl Belmore, in the County of Fermanagh. Lord Belmore was High Sheriff of County Tyrone in 1769 and of County Fermanagh in 1779. Castle Coole Castle Coole, Co Fermanagh Lowry inherited the Corry family estate of Castle Coole in 1774, and took the additional name of Corry in recognition of this inheritance. The papers of the Lowry-Corry family show that the earl's political ambitions were a significant factor in the rebuilding of Castle Coole, which is widely regarded as the most palatial Classical 18th century house in Ireland, celebrated as the masterpiece of James Wyatt. In a characteristically incisive introduction to the catalogue of the Belmore papers at the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, Dr Anthony Malcomson writes: > \\"Castle Coole was built as part and parcel of Belmore's plans for his own > and his family's political and social aggrandisement...it was well-situated > to mark the nucleus of a north-western political power bloc in the Irish > Parliament...That parliament, its autonomy enhanced by the so-called > Constitution of 1782 looked as if it would last forever...Castle Coole > therefore reflects Belmore's confidence in his own political future and in > the future of the political institutions of the day. It was to be the home > of a great Irish political family: not merely a place to live in, but a > showpiece to proclaim Belmore's position in Irish society and influence in > the Irish House of Commons.\\" Unfortunately for Lord Belmore that confidence proved to be misplaced. Although he had inherited various family estates totaling some 70,000 acres (280 km²) and with a rent roll of at least £12,000 a year, and had risen through the ranks of the peerage, ultimately the Act of Union 1800 ended his chances of political influence. All that remained of his ambitions was Castle Coole itself, and that was really more a source of satisfaction to posterity than to himself, for he effectively handed over his various properties to his son and heir, Somerset, on his coming-of-age in 1795. Malcomson writes that by the time of Lord Belmore's death, the total debt affecting his estates stood at £133,000, of which about £70,000 was attributable to the building of Castle Coole, and that while the house was completed within his lifetime, it was not to be fully furnished until his son had inherited the estate.  Family  Lord Belmore was married firstly on 3 October 1771 to Lady Margaret Butler (23 January 1748 - Apr 1775), eldest daughter of Somerset Butler, 1st Earl of Carrick by his wife Lady Juliana Boyle, first daughter by his second wife of Henry Boyle, 1st Earl of Shannon, and had issue: *Galbraith Lowry-Corry (1772–1773) *Somerset Lowry-Corry, 2nd Earl Belmore He was married secondly on 2 March 1780 to Lady Harriet Hobart (7 April 1762 –14 July 1805), eldest daughter and co-heir of John Hobart, 2nd Earl of Buckinghamshire, who was at the time the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, by his first wife Mary Anne Drury, first daughter and co-heiress of Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Drury, 1st Baronet, of Overstone, and had issue: *Lady Louisa Mary Anne Julia Harriet Lowry-Corry (3 April 1781 –19 April 1862), who was married to George John Montagu, 6th Earl of Sandwich, and had issue: (i) Lady Harriet Mary Montagu (14 May 1805 – 4 May 1857) and (ii) John William Montagu, 7th Earl of Sandwich (8 November 1811 – 3 March 1884) Lord Belmore's second marriage was subsequently dissolved by an Act of Parliament in 1793, with Lady Belmore later marrying William Kerr, 6th Marquess of Lothian. He was married for a third time on 1 March 1794 to Mary Anne Caldwell (17 April 1755 –13 December 1841), eldest daughter of Sir John Caldwell, 4th Baronet, of Castle Caldwell, County Fermanagh, by his wife Elizabeth Hort, daughter of the Most Reverend Josiah Hort, Archbishop of Tuam. Lord Belmore died at Bath on 2 February 1802 aged 61 and was succeeded by his only surviving son.

They can be regarded as spiro compounds twice over. Because of their inherent strain and instability, fenestranes are of theoretical interest to chemists. The name—proposed in 1972 by Vlasios Georgian and Martin Saltzman—is derived from the Latin word for window, fenestra. Georgian had intended that \\"fenestrane\\" solely referred to [4.4.4.4]fenestrane, whose skeletal structure looks like windows, and Kenneth B. Wiberg called that specific structure \\"windowpane\\". The term fenestrane has since become generalized to refer to the whole class of molecules that have various other ring-sizes. Georgian recommended rosettane for the class, based on the structural appearance as a rosette of flowers. Nomenclature and structure Fenestranes can have various numbers of atoms in the rings. [3.3.3.3]Fenestrane is the smallest possible structure. See the section for discussion of its geometry. Structures within this class of chemicals can be named according to the number of atoms in each ring in addition to the systematic nomenclature of IUPAC naming rules. The smallest member of the family, consisting of four fused cyclopropane rings, is [3.3.3.3]fenestrane, which has systematic name tetracyclo[2.1.0.01,3.02,5]pentane and is also called pyramidane. The next symmetric member, [4.4.4.4]fenestrane, has four cyclobutane rings fused, and has systematic name tetracyclo[3.3.1.03,9.07,9]nonane. The rings need not all be the same size as each other, so [4.4.4.5]fenestrane has three cyclobutane rings and one cyclopentane ring. Other structural modifications vary the name as usual in systematic nomenclature, so a [4.6.4.6]fenestradiene has two cyclobutane rings and two cyclohexane rings in an alternating pattern and two alkene units in the ring structure. c,t,c,c-[4.5.5.5]Fenestrane, with ring-sizes and the one trans ring-fusion highlighted. In addition to the ring sizes, fenestranes can have various combinations of cis and trans geometry at each ring fusion. These details are denoted by \\"c\\" and \\"t\\" prefixes to the structure name, listed in the same order as the ring-sizes. For example, c,t,c,c-[4.5.5.5]fenestrane has a trans configuration at one of the cyclopentane/cyclopentane fusions, but cis configuration at the other cyclopentane/cyclopentane fusion and at both butanepentane/cyclopentane fusions. In an extreme case the central carbon atom, which would ordinarily have tetrahedral molecular geometry for its four bonds gets completely flattened. In the molecular orbital picture for the resulting square planar geometry of methane, two of a total of three sp2-hybridized carbon atomic orbitals form regular bonds with two of the hydrogen atoms as in a planar alkene. The third sp2 orbital interacts in a three-center two-electron bond with the two remaining hydrogen atoms utilizing only the hydrogen electrons. Two additional carbon valence electrons are situated in a p orbital perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. The four C–H bonds are equal due to resonance. In silico calculations show that it takes 95 to 250 kcal/mol (400 to 1,050 kJ/mol) for this process. One of the most highly strained fenestranes to have been isolated is a [4.4.4.5]fenestrane with bond angles at the central carbon atom of around 130° (based on X-ray crystallography), as compared to the 109.45° standard for tetrahedral atoms. The carbon–carbon bond-lengths deviate from those of normal alkanes as well. Whereas the C–C bond in ethane is 155 pm, in this fenestrane, the bonds extending from the central carbon atom are shortened to 149 pm while those at the perimeter are lengthened to 159 pm. A diterpene called laurenene containing a [5.5.5.7]fenestrane ring system was the first natural fenestrane to be discovered. The first fenestrane ever synthesized was a [4.5.5.6]fenestrane:The first step in this reaction sequence is an adaptation of the Stork enamine alkylation reacting cyclopentanone with 3-bromo-1-butene through an imine derivative with pyrrolidine and forming a magnesium salt with ethyl magnesium bromide. The next step is a regular Stork enamine reaction followed by an aldol condensation forming the cyclohexenone ring. The final step is a photolytic [2+2]cycloaddition. Fenestrane synthesis 1972 Pyramidanes Pyramidane ([3.3.3.3]fenestrane) is the smallest possible fenestrane, and has never been synthesised. If the central carbon were to be tetrahedral, it would have the form of spiropentadiene, but with additional bonds between the two cyclopropyl rings rather than double-bonds within them. The analogous germa- and stannapyramidanes, with trimethylsilyl groups bonded to the corners, Ge[C4(SiMe3)4] and Sn[C4(SiMe3)4] on the other hand have been synthesised. These adopt a square pyramidal geometry analogous to the trigonal pyramid of tetrahedrane, with the germanium or tin atom at the vertex. That atom has an inverted tetrahedral geometry. According to nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, the four carbons of the base of the pyramid behave as an aromatic ring. Synthetic approaches In one study, a [4.5.5.5]fenestrane was synthesized with one carbon atom replaced by nitrogen because aza- compounds and their salts are more likely to form crystalline compounds suitable for X-ray analysis than low-molecular-weight alkanes. In step 1 the alkyl halide 1-iodo-3-butene 1 is converted to a cyanozinc cuprate 2 (by transmetalation of the organozinc iodide with copper cyanide) which reacts in the next step with 1-nitrocyclopentene 3 in a nucleophilic addition whereby the nitronate 4 is captured by phenylselenenyl bromide to the selenium intermediate 5. Hydrogen peroxide oxidation of 5 yields the nitroalkene 6 as a mixture of syn and anti isomers. A [4+2]cycloaddition with n-butylenol ether in presence of trimethylaluminium gives the nitronate 7 and a second [3+2]cycloaddition by heating in presence of potassium carbonate gives the nitroso acetal 8. Hydrogenation with Raney nickel gives the diol 9 which on a double Mitsunobu reaction (with an amine proton donor) gives the azafenestrane 10 as the borane salt. Azafenestrane synthesis 2006 In the borane salt the N–C–C bond angle is 126°. One study describes an unusual 8π disrotatory – 6π conrotatory electrocyclic cascade reaction aiming to minimise the number of steps required to synthesise a fenestrane.Reagents: P-2 Ni (Ni(OAc)2·4H2O) / hydrogen gas.

The name refers to CHL's ability to detect aircraft flying at altitudes below the capabilities of the original Chain Home (CH) radars, where most CHL radars were co-located. CHL could reliably detect aircraft flying as low as . The official name was AMES Type 2, referring to the Air Ministry Experimental Station at Bawdsey Manor where it was developed, but this name was almost never used in practice. The system had originally been developed by the British Army's research group, also based at Bawdsey, as a system for detecting enemy shipping in the English Channel. It was built using the electronics being developed for the Airborne Interception radar systems, which worked on the 1.5 m band. This high-frequency, for the era, allowed it to use smaller antennas that could be swung back and forth to look for returns, in contrast to the enormous fixed antennas of the 6.7 m wavelength Chain Home system. When the war opened, the Luftwaffe began mine- laying missions where the bomber aircraft would fly almost all of their mission flying at low altitude. Chain Home could only see targets above 2.5 degrees over the horizon, so these aircraft only became visible at short range. Robert Watson Watt seized several dozen of the CD systems that were in final construction and installed them at CH stations and new locations along the seashore to fill this critical gap in the coverage. CHL remained an important part of the Chain network for the rest of the war, and was retained in the post-war era until it was replaced during the ROTOR upgrades by the AMES Type 80. The electronics, notably the high-power transmitter, was also re-used in a number of other systems, most notably the AMES Type 7. Development Accidental discovery CHL traces its origins to early experiments with Airborne Interception radar systems in 1936. These were developed as a short-range radar that would be used to close the gap between Chain Home's (CH) approximate accuracy and the visual range of a night fighter pilot at about . Developed by a second team at Bawdsey Manor led by \\"Taffy\\" Bowen, the new radar had to operate at much shorter wavelengths in order to limit the antenna sizes to something that could be practically fit on an aeroplane. After considerable experimentation, the team settled on a set working at 1.5 meter wavelength, about 193 MHz in the VHF band. In early experiments with the new set, the team found that detection of other aircraft was problematic due to their target's relatively small size, but especially reflections off the ground. The latter caused a very strong signal that appeared to be at a range equal to the aircraft's current altitude, and everything beyond that was invisible in the clutter. This meant that a typical night bombing run by German aircraft at altitude would only become visible at that range, far less than the desired minimum of 5 miles (about 26,400 feet). These same experiments demonstrated an unexpected side-effect. As the aircraft flew around over Bawdsey, which is located on the coast of the English Channel, the team found strong constant returns that they later realized were the cranes at the Harwich Docks, miles away. Other smaller returns were quickly identified as boats in the Channel. These were being detected at ranges far beyond the maximum range against aircraft, in spite of the antennas not being designed for this role. The potential of this discovery was not lost, and Robert Watson-Watt asked the team to demonstrate the concept in a real-world setting. A series of military exercises in the Channel in September 1937 provided a perfect test. On 3 September the team's test aircraft, Avro Anson K6260, detected several Royal Navy ships in the Channel, and the next day repeated this performance in spite of almost complete overcast. Albert Percival Rowe of the Tizard Committee later commented that \\"This, had they known, was the writing on the wall for the German Submarine Service.\\" CD The British Army was actually the first to consider radar, when W. A. S. Butement and P. E. Pollard submitted a paper in 1931 suggesting using pulses of radio signal to measure the distance to ships.Butement, W. A. S. & Pollard, P. E.; \\"Coastal Defense Apparatus\\", Inventions Book, Royal Engineers, January 1931 The Army was uninterested until they heard about Watt's work at Bawdsey, when they suddenly became very interested. In October 1936 a liaison team led by E. T. Paris and Albert Beaumont Wood was set up at Bawdsey, officially known as the Military Applications Section, but universally referred to as the \\"Army Cell\\". Ironically, the only two technicians with the required experience available were Butement and Pollard. The two quickly began development of two projects, the Mobile Radar Unit (MRU) which was a mobile version of Chain Home, and Gun Laying radar, a much smaller unit designed to provide range measurements against aircraft as an aid to aiming their anti-aircraft artillery. The teams had made considerable progress on both projects by the summer of 1937, with Gun Laying radar, Mk. I (GL) about to enter initial production, and the MRUs later taken over in 1938 by the RAF AMES Type 9. With this work starting to move from development to production, coincident with Bowen's astonishing anti-shipping demonstration, Butement began adapting Bowen's 1.5 m set for what became the Coast Defence radar (CD), allowing the Army's coastal artillery to aim their guns at night or in fog. The CD set was in most respects a version of the GL working at the shorter 1.5 m wavelength, and like GL, used separate transmit and receive antennas that had to be rotated together to be aimed at a target. The earlier GL system operated at just over 6 m, which meant the antenna was very large. The GL array had only four horizontal elements in it, which offered resolution on the order of 20 degrees. This allowed the operator to pick out a single aircraft as long as they weren't in formation, but could not be used to directly guide the guns. In contrast, the 1.5 m wavelength of the new sets allowed an antenna of about the same size to feature eight dipoles, reducing the angle to about 1.5 degrees. Although this was of marginal capability in terms of directly aiming the guns, in July 1939 it was noticed that when the Army's 9.2-inch guns missed their targets, the splash of water caused by the shell would cause a brief but obvious return on the radar sets. This meant that any inaccuracy in the radar antenna's measurements could be eliminated by comparing the target and the splashes on the screen, as these would both have exactly the same error. The gunners could then correct their fire (\\"walk\\") onto the targets in the same fashion that they would when being given corrections by remote observers. CD becomes CHL Metrovick Type T3026 transmitter During early tests against Chain Home in 1938, RAF pilots had noticed they could escape detection by flying at low altitudes. This was due to the minimum angle of the CH being about 1.5 degrees above the horizon, which meant aircraft were below the radar's sight until they approached within a few miles. They could escape detection entirely by flying between two CH stations at altitudes around . At first this was not considered to be a serious limitation, as bombers typically flew at altitudes of 15,000 feet or greater, and at that altitude they could be detected over France. But as the magnitude of the problem became clear, Watt became concerned. In July 1939 he placed an order for 24-CD sets under the name AMES Type 2 (Type 1 being Chain Home), intending to place one at each Chain Home station to allow coverage at lower altitudes, as low as . These differed from the CD sets primarily in the antenna: instead of a single horizontal array, CHL used four stacked arrays of five dipoles, reducing the azimuth accuracy but allowing altitude to be estimated by comparing the returns from the different sets of vertical arrays. In keeping with its rapid introduction, CHL was a relatively simple manually-directed system that required the operator to hunt for targets by swinging the antenna back and forth looking for returns. The antenna was originally powered by WAAFs mounted on wheel-less bicycles whose chains were connected to a gear system. It was not long after the start of the war that the Germans accidentally noticed the same thing. In this case, aircraft sent on minelaying sorties almost always returned while those on other intruder missions were almost always intercepted. These aircraft had to drop their payloads from very low altitudes, so they generally followed routes over water, including rivers, flying at low altitudes for most of the mission. At first it was not obvious why they were surviving, as there could be many reasons; fighters might not be able to see them against the ground, AA guns positioned inland might not be able to aim at them, etc. But it quickly became apparent that low altitude flight meant they were not being detected on the radars. The Luftwaffe soon began a series of low-level attacks that proved almost impossible to defend against. Additional CHL sets were ordered and set up to fill the gaps between the sets co-located at the CH stations. In April 1941 all of the CHL sets were upgraded with a new antenna that was motorized to spin at 1, 1.5, 2 or 3.33 rpm, and used a single transmit/receive antenna instead of separate ones. CHL and GCI Chain Home Low station at Hopton-on-Sea When first deployed, CHL was used both for early detection of low-level targets, as well as a system for tracking individual aircraft over land; unlike CH which was permanently facing over water, CHL could be turned to look in any direction. This later role became outdated with the introduction of the Type 7 GCI in 1942. Electronically, the Type 7 was essentially a larger and more powerful version of the CHL concept, with a larger ground-level antenna. However, the antenna was continuously spun through a complete circle, and returns were plotted in a map-like form known as a plan-position indicator (PPI). Whereas CHL operators had to calculate a single target's position from the range and bearing, Type 7 operators saw all of the aircraft in their area simultaneously and could determine their map location directly. CHL was increasingly used purely for early warning, calling in the rough location of targets to Type 7 stations who would then know where to look. Later, 3 GHz-frequency Chain Home Extra Low (CHEL) radar were often co-sited with CHL sites, further extending detection as low as . Several adaptations of the CHL were made during the war. Such systems could be mobile in which units were placed on trucks for movement matching the enemy's, extending the RAF's options in engaging the enemy. Margam CHL Station, 2012 AMES Type 11 Although GCI began to supplant CHL during 1941 and especially 1942, CHL continued to provide an important early warning role. In February 1942 the Germans mounted the Channel Dash, moving two of their battleships to harbors in Germany by sailing them right up the English Channel. This major embarrassment was due largely to supremely effective jamming on the part of the Germans, who managed to render the CH and CHL radars covering the coast entirely ineffective without the operators even noticing. To address this, the RAF began development of the AMES Type 11, a truck-mounted CHL system operating at 500–600 MHz. This frequency was chosen to match that of German anti-aircraft radars, in the hopes that the signals would be more difficult to notice, and that jamming would have negative effects on the German's own radars. Type 11's were deliberately used only in times of jamming in order to avoid giving the Germans signals intelligence about them, and in the end were little used.

It is located in the Boven Suriname municipality (resort) in the Sipaliwini District. It has a population of approximately 400 people in 2018. Pokigron is located at the end of a paved road via Brownsweg to the Afobakaweg. Pokigron is often referred to as Atjoni which is the nearby quay, and literally the end of the road. Villages to the South of Pokigron have to be accessed by boat. Nearby towns and villages include Wittiehede Ston (19.6 nm), Mofina (15.6 nm), Wittikamba (1.4 nm), Malrosee-Kondre (5.1 nm) and Abenaston (3.0 nm).  History  Pokigron was, up to 1986, a village with a population of 700, and reasonably prosperous as the main transport hub to the south of the country. Many of the typical huts with thatched roofs had been replaced by houses, and the village even had street lights. This changed on 23 April 1987. The Surinamese Interior War which had started far away in Albina and Moengotapoe the previous year, had come to Sipaliwini. The Jungle Commando headed by Ronnie Brunswijk ordered the villagers into the jungle, robbed them of their possessions, and burned their houses. On 11 September 1987, the National Army lead by Dési Bouterse retaliated by attacking the Jungle Commando, and according to a report by Aide Médicale Internationale, killed civilians including women and children. Both parties have denied that any civilians had been killed. On 27 September 1989, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights looked into the matter, declared that this constituted a very serious violation of the Right to Life, recommended that the Government of Suriname investigate the matter, and that the relatives of the victims are entitled to fair compensation. The IACHR identified 15 cases of deaths, four disappearances and one was unclear. Six of the cases were children, and three were women of which one was raped before she was killed. On October 1993, the IACHR sentenced the Government of Suriname to pay $400,000 in damages to the victims. A group of civilians from Pokigron following the incidents squatted in a terrain near Paramaribo, and have named their camp Sunny Point. It is located in Koewarasan, Wanica. As of 3 February 2018, the village of Pokigron now has 24 hours of electricity, because the Diesel generators could only provide for 5 to 6 hours.

Also known as \\"Pe'reru Tepu\\", the village is typically referred to simply as \\"Tepu,\\" which mean \\"high\\" in the Indian Tiriyó language. The village is located on Tepu hill, on the Tapanahoni River. Though inhabited by Amerindian tribes indigenous to the area, the village was created by Christian missionaries and (primarily) Tiriyó Indians, though it now also includes small numbers of Wayana and Akuriyo Indians. The village has a tribal organization, led by a Trio Captain. Pelelu Tepu has a school, and electricity, however there is often no fuel to run the diesel generators. Pelelu Tepu is home to a Medische Zending healthcare centre. History Around 1965, the Dutch colonial government and the American missionaries constructed the village. The village had a school, a church, and a medical clinic. The higher standard of living attracted many Amerindians who settled in Tëpu. In 1986 the Surinamese Interior War started. At first the Amerindians remained neutral, but later the captains agreed to a request by Desi Bouterse to receive weapons and militaries in order to train the Tëpu. In 1991, the Jungle Commando took revenge, and even though nobody was killed, most of the population fled to Brazil where many remain. In 1992, they were back to zero, and three people had died from starvation. The teachers refused to give up, and kept the school open. Shaman Tëmeta Wetaru wanted to preserve the history of Tiriyó, and to give the population an incentive to learn Dutch. In 1981, he started to write and dictate Tamenta’s Testament. In 2001, a shaman apprentice school was founded in Tëpu to preserve indigenous medical knowledge.  Energy  Since April 2018, the village is powered by solar power, through a project initiated by Amazon Conservation Team Suriname and funded by the Japan-Caribbean Climate Change Partnership (J-CCCP) and UNDP. For this project, two women from Tepu completed a six-month training program as solar engineer at Barefoot College in Tilonia, India.

The Commission has responsibility for the promotion and enforcement of equality and non-discrimination laws in England, Scotland and Wales. It took over the responsibilities of the Commission for Racial Equality, the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Disability Rights Commission. It also has responsibility for other aspects of equality law: age, sexual orientation and religion or belief. A national human rights institution, it seeks to promote and protect human rights in England and Wales. The EHRC has offices in Manchester, London, Glasgow and Cardiff.https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/contact-us/our-offices It is a non-departmental public body (NDPB) sponsored by the Government Equalities Office, part of the Department for Education (DfE). It is separate from and independent from Government but accountable for its use of public funds. The Chairman of the Commission is David Isaac. The EHRC's functions do not extend to Northern Ireland, where there is a separate Equality Commission (ECNI) and a Human Rights Commission (NIHRC), each and both established under the Northern Ireland Act 1998 in pursuance to the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement. Powers The EHRC derives its powers from the Equality Act 2006, which resulted from the government white paper, Fairness for All: A New Commission for Equality and Human Rights. Section 3 states the EHRC has a general duty to work towards the development of a society where equality and rights are rooted. This is taken to mean, > (a) people's ability to achieve their potential is not limited by prejudice > or discrimination, > (b) there is respect for and protection of each individual's human rights > (including respect for the dignity and worth of each individual), > (c) each person has an equal opportunity to participate in society, and > (d) there is mutual respect between communities based on understanding and > valuing of diversity and on shared respect for equality and human rights. Section 30 strengthens the EHRC's ability to apply for judicial review and to intervene in court proceedings, through giving explicit statutory provision for such action. Sections 31–2 gives the EHRC a new power to assess public authorities' compliance with their positive equality duties. It can issue \\"compliance notices\\" if it finds a public authority is failing in its duties. Public authorities, importantly, are bound under the Human Rights Act 1998 to act in a way compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (s.6 HRA). The EHRC's role is therefore one of catching matters before they lead to the courts. So if you work for a public sector employer (like a local council or the civil service) there are more avenues to enforce equality standards in your favour. This may seem somewhat odd, considering that public sector employers are consistently shown to have excellent workplace practices.see, for instance, Michael Rubenstein Equality, the private sector and the Discrimination Law Review: A preliminary report at [29] Section 30(3) of the Equality Act 2006 allows the EHRC to bring judicial review proceedings under the HRA against public authorities. This is a stronger tool than usual, because the EHRC is not subject to the normal requirement of being a \\"victim\\" of a Human Rights violation.see s.7(1)(b) HRA 1998; usually you can only bring a Human Rights claim if you are actually the person whose rights are violated. You cannot do it on someone else's behalf. Under section 24, the EHRC can enter into binding agreements with employers. So for instance, it can agree that an employer will commit to equality best practice audits or avoid discriminatory practices that it may identify, in return for not investigating (a bad thing for employers' publicity). It can enforce these agreements through injunctions. Previously only the Disability Rights Commission had such powers, the CRE and the EOC were more limited. For instance, the EOC used only to have the power to get injunctions against bodies with a bad track record of discrimination.s. 73 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 Section 20 gives the EHRC the power to carry out investigations when it has the \\"suspicion\\" of unlawful discrimination taking place. Before. this had been limited to a requirement of \\"reasonable suspicion\\" which in effect led the predecessors to be much more cautious. In legal terms this is the difference between an irrationality test and a reasonable man test. In other words, a court could not declare an investigation unlawful unless it considered that the EHRC was carrying out an investigation where no reasonable person could have come to the same conclusion. Before a court could declare an investigation unlawful if it thought that the proverbial \\"man on the Clapham Omnibus\\" would not regard an employer as being a suspect \\"discriminator\\". There are some complications in relation to the Human Rights Act 1998 with the EHRC's powers. If it is going to be a \\"named investigation\\" (i.e. the employer will probably get shamed by the publication of its name during an investigation), the EHRC cannot start an investigation into a public authority for breaches under the HRA. Also, it cannot support individual cases in tribunals and courts where the issue would concern matters that fall only under the HRA and not under some pre-existing British equality legislation (like the Sex Discrimination Act 1975). Practically this will be problematic, not least because if a claim did exist under the HRA, British legislation which did not cover such problems would usually be updated to comply with European Convention rights (these are the ones that the HRA implements). Also, the line between what is in the European Convention, what is actually covered by domestic legislation, is difficult to draw. At any rate, section 28 gives the Minister the power to give authorisation for a discrimination case to be fought if a domestic legislation issue has dropped away, but a purely human rights issue remains. As a successor body, the EHRC's new powers were not dramatic. Some people called for the changes to go further, for instance, to allow the EHRC to bring proceedings against employers in its own name on any issue (not just human rights ones).Colm O'Cinneide, \\"The Commission for Equality and Human Rights: A New Institution for New and Uncertain Times” (2007) Industrial Law Journal 141, 157 The American, Australian, Belgian, Canadian and New Zealand counterparts can. International status Although it operates at sub- national level, the EHRC was in 2009 recognised as a member of the worldwide network of national human rights institutions, securing \\"A status\\" accreditation from the International Co-ordinating Committee of NHRIs (ICC). This gives the Commission enhanced access to the Human Rights Council, treaty bodies and other United Nations human rights bodies. The EHRC was the second NHRI in the UK, following the creation of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) in 1999, and the Scottish Human Rights Commission (SHRC) became the third to gain ICC accreditation in 2010. The three bodies share representation and voting rights in the ICC and its regional network, the European Group of NHRIs. The EHRC has since 2008 engaged in parallel reporting (\\"shadow reporting\\") at examinations of the UK under the UN and Council of Europe human rights treaties, and in the Universal Periodic Review. It was designated in 2008 as part of the United Kingdom's independent mechanism for promoting, monitoring and protecting implementation in the state of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). (It shares that role with the other two NHRIs in the UK – the NIHRC and SHRC – and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland.) The EHRC chairs the CRPD Working Group of the European Group of NHRIs. Operations The Board of Commission comprises commissioners with backgrounds in equality and human rights. The latest round of appointments was announced in May 2018. , they are: *David Isaac CBE (Chairman) *Caroline Waters OBE (Deputy Chair) *Suzanne Baxter *Pavita Cooper *Alasdair Henderson *Rebecca Hilsenrath (Chief Executive) *Susan Johnson OBE *Helen Mahy CBE *Mark McLane *Lesley Sawers OBE (Scotland Commissioner) *Professor Swaran Singh Some of the first set of Commissioners resigned towards the end of their first term, while others did not seek a second term. These Commissioners included Morag Alexander, Kay Allen, Baroness Campbell of Surbiton, Jeannie Drake CBE, Joel Edwards, Mike Smith, Professor Kay Hampton, Francesca Klug, Sir Bert Massie CBE, Ziauddin Sardar, Ben Summerskill and Dr Neil Wooding. Nicola Brewer, the first chief executive (and ex officio Commissioner), returned to the diplomatic service. The chair, David Isaac, was formerly chairman of LGBT charity Stonewall and trustee of the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund. He is a partner at Pinsent Masons. The Chief Executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, was listed by The Times in 2012 as among the 100 most influential lawyers in the country, and has been awarded two honorary doctorates in law. She has practised in the private, public and pro bono sectors. She has spoken about the relevance to her work of experiencing the challenges of bringing up five children and her strong Jewish faith. The EHRC has four offices: in London (in Salisbury Square, EC4), in Manchester (in the Arndale Centre), in Cardiff (in Gabalfa), and in Glasgow (on West George Street). In 2017, the National Audit Office reported that the Commission's budget had been cut by almost 70% in the ten years since it was created, with plans for a further 25% reduction over the next four years. Notable activities British National Party Following the election of two MEPs from the British National Party (BNP) in the 2009 European elections, a potential issue of public funding was raised by the Commission as the BNP constitution states that recruitment is only open to members who are \\"indigenous Caucasian and defined ethnic groups emanating from that Race\\" The Commission's legal director John Wadham stated that \\"The legal advice we have received indicates that the British National party's constitution and membership criteria, employment practices and provision of services to constituents and the public may breach discrimination laws which all political parties are legally obliged to uphold\\" This relates to the Race Relations Act 1976, which outlaws the refusal or deliberate omission to offer employment on the basis of non-membership of an organisation. The Commission asked the BNP to provide written undertakings that there will not be discrimination in its recruitment procedures. The BNP responded to the letter by stating that it \\"intends to clarify the word 'white' on its website\\". However, because the commission believed the BNP would continue to discriminate against potential or actual members on racial grounds, on 24 August 2009 the commission announced that they had issued county court proceedings against it. In a statement, the Commission reduced the grounds on which it was taking action against the BNP, stating \\"The Commission believes the BNP's constitution and membership criteria are discriminatory and, further, that the continued publication of them on the BNP website is unlawful. It has therefore issued county court proceedings against party leader Nick Griffin and two other officials. The Commission has decided not to take action on two further grounds set out in its letter before action, in the light of the BNP's commitment to comply with the law.\\" Campaigns These include: 2010 – Care and Support A report produced by the Commission highlighted the need to shift from a \\"safety net\\" approach to care to a \\"springboard\\". The report suggested ways that individuals could be given greater autonomy over their lives and encouraged to engage in society and make social and economic contributions. 2016 – Working Better The Working Better Initiative was launched with a remit of coming up with innovative ways to meet the needs of modern workforce, with a particular focus on flexibility and family life. The Home Front survey formed part of the initial consultation process. 2018 – Good Relations The Commission aims to provide research and resources and advice to Local Authorities and to enable greater understanding between communities. Metropolitan Police Service In September 2016, the EHRC published a report on discrimination within the Metropolitan Police Service. The investigation was launched in response to concerns about the MPS's treatment of Black and minority ethnic (BME), female and gay officers and focused on the MPS's grievance and misconduct procedures. Inequality A 2018 EHRC report, co-authored by Jonathan Portes and Howard Reed, found government policies disproportionately harmed the poorest in UK society. Public service and benefits cuts disproportionately affect those with least, single parents and disabled people. This puts the government in breach of its human rights obligations. The study considers the extent of the cuts and their disproportionate effect on the most disadvantaged were a policy choice, and not inevitable. The study investigates spending on the NHS, social care, police, transport, housing and education from 2010 to 2015 on different groups in England, Scotland and Wales. It also attempts to predict the effect of spending plans for these services to 2021–22, and alterations to taxes and benefits. Reductions per person since 2010 were notably higher in England, (roughly 18%) than in Wales (5.5%) and Scotland (1%), partly because devolved governments chose to reduce some effects of the cuts. The 20% of people in England with lowest income lost on average 11% of their incomes due to austerity contrasted with no losses for the wealthiest fifth of households. Lone-parent households lost most from tax and spending alterations, on average. In England, they lost 19% of their income, contrasted with 10.5% in Wales and 7.6% in Scotland. Large families lost more than smaller ones. Families with three or more children lost on average 13% of final income, contrasted with between 7% and 8% in Scotland and Wales. Households with disabled members, households with an average adult age of 18–24, and black households lost disproportionately from austerity cuts. Making vulnerable groups suffer austerity cuts disproportionately goes against non- discrimination principles which the UK has agreed to under international human rights law. Ministers are asked by the authors to reduce the impact of austerity cuts through raising means-tested benefits, tax credits and universal credit, and increasing spending on health, social care, education and social housing. Rebecca Hilsenrath of the EHRC said, \\"We know that some communities are being left behind and that the gap is widening. We know we need to do something before it’s too late and we’ve shown that it’s possible to assess public spending decisions to see if we can make the impact fairer.\\" Labour Party In September 2017, EHRC Chief Executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, demanded a zero tolerance approach to antisemitism in the Labour Party and swift action by the leadership to deal with it. In May 2019, after submissions by the Jewish Labour Movement and the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA), the EHRC launched a formal investigation under section 20 of the Equality Act 2006 into whether Labour had \\"unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish\\": specifically, whether \\"unlawful acts have been committed by the party and/or its employees and/or its agents, and; whether the party has responded to complaints of unlawful acts in a lawful, efficient and effective manner.\\" The CAA was represented in its case to the EHRC by Doughty Street Chambers barrister Adam Wagner,, a member of the EHRC's panel of counsel. In March 2019, Antony Lerman, former founding director of the Institute for Jewish Policy Research, raised concerns that Hilsenrath's September 2017 statement made her unsuitable to lead a probe into Labour, writing in OpenDemocracy: \\"Prior to investigation, is it not worrying that the CEO already claims to know what the Labour Party needs to do?\\" Hilsenrath later recused herself from the decision to investigate the Labour Party as her status as “an active member of the Anglo-Jewish community\\" could cause a perception of bias. The Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, looked forward to the investigation's conclusions stating: \\"I want it quicker actually, I need it speeded up. Let's learn the lessons and then also work with the organisation to implement what recommendations they bring forward. On that basis I'm hoping we'll get a clean bill of health but, more importantly, we can become much more effective at tackling not just antisemitism but racism, both in our party and society overall.\\" Labour deputy leader Tom Watson spoke of his \\"utter shame\\" that the investigation was taking place. The investigation was welcomed by the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM). Jewish Voice for Labour (JVL) also welcomed the investigation but argued that, without making public the complaints the EHRC received and Labour's initial response, the EHRC have violated the Equality Act 2006 which requires that they specify who is being investigated and \\"the nature of the unlawful act\\" they are suspected of committing, as required by its own terms of reference. Signatories to JVL's letter included human rights lawyer Sir Geoffrey Bindman QC. In December 2019, the JLM submission to the inquiry was leaked to the media. It included 70 sworn testimonies from current and former Party staff members, and concluded that “the Labour party is no longer a safe space for Jewish people”. Draft findings were passed to the Labour Party in July 2020, with 28 days to respond and a likely publication date of September 2020. Conservative Party The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) first asked the EHRC to investigate the Conservative Party in May 2019. It received no reply and made a second request in November 2019 and again received no reply. In March 2020, the MCB submitted a dossier including 300 supposed cases of prejudiced or discriminatory language against Muslims within the Conservative Party. On 12 May, the EHRC announced that it would not be investigating the Conservative Party for racism, pending its monitoring of the party's own internal review. Controversy Prior to David Isaac's appointment as chair of the Commission, two parliamentary committees warned that there was a potential conflict of interest because his legal firm carries out “significant work for the government”, after he accepted that his annual legal income of over £500,000 would dwarf the £50,000 he would earn from the EHRC. While Christian Concern called for his appointment to be blocked, it was welcomed by The Jewish Chronicle. In May 2019, Suzanne Baxter, another EHRC board member, joined Pinsent Masons. In March 2017, the EHCR was criticised by campaigners, including Lord Ouseley and Peter Herbert, for allegedly targeting BAME staff for compulsory redundancies and for failing to appoint BAME personnel to senior positions. The campaigners said that, out of 12 staff selected for redundancy, only two were white British, while eight were from a BAME background, four were Muslim, and six were disabled. Campaigners also said that there were no visible minorities among the senior management team, after the only black director was selected for redundancy, and that all two of the remaining BAME workers were on the bottom three pay grades. The EHRC denied claims that staff were sacked by email. In June 2020, Newsweek reported that an EHRC commissioner, Pavita Cooper, had failed to declare a November 2013 £3,500 donation to the Conservative Party recorded on the Electoral Commission website and an October 2013 fundraising reception she and her husband hosted for her local party in Brentford and Isleworth, both prior to her appointment as a commissioner in 2018. The EHRC made a statement saying \\"Pavita Cooper has not made a donation to any political party and is not a member of any party.\\" In July 2020, Newsweek reported that two BAME former commissioners at the EHRC, Baroness Meral Hussein-Ece and Lord Simon Woolley, said they were not reappointed to their roles in November 2012 because they were \\"too loud and vocal\\" about issues of race.

It first aired on September 16, 2006, originally as part of Disney Channel's Playhouse Disney daily block intended for preschoolers. On February 14, 2011, it was moved to the Disney Junior block, which served as Playhouse Disney's replacement. The series' final episode aired on February 14, 2013. The titular character is voiced by Wilmer Valderrama. The show was created by Roger Bollen, Marilyn Sadler, and Rick Gitelson. The animation is produced by Canada-based Nelvana and features the voice talents of Wilmer Valderrama, Dee Bradley Baker, Tom Kenny, Fred Stoller, Nika Futterman, Kath Soucie, Carlos Alazraqui, Grey DeLisle, and Nancy Truman. The theme song is performed by Los Lobos. The series was made available on Disney+ on November 12, 2019 (the day it launched in Canada, Netherlands, and the US). Synopsis Handy Manny is set in the fictional town of Sheet Rock Hills where the titular character, Manny, owns a repair shop along with his anthropomorphic talking tools. It is unknown exactly where this town is located, but there are a multitude of Spanish speaking residents within it and the town is surrounded by tropical ocean water (as seen in the introduction). Most 30-minute episodes contain two stories. They typically begin with Manny and the tools interacting in Manny's repair shop. While there, someone, usually needing something repaired or assembled, calls Manny, who answers, \\"Hola, Handy Manny's Repair Shop. You break it...\\" and then the Tools shout \\"We fix it!\\" After hearing who needs help where, Manny and the Tools sing \\"Hop Up, Jump In\\" while the Tools hop into his tool box. In each episode when Manny and the Tools leave for the repair, they see Mr. Lopart with his pet cat Fluffy in front of his candy store. Mr. Lopart would try to do something on his own without any prior experience. Manny offers him to help but Mr. Lopart says that he doesn't need any help, after Manny and the Tools leave the item Mr. Lopart was building would malfunction and cause a mess. Once Manny and the tools arrive at the repair site, they collaborate on the best way to fix the broken item. Manny then goes to Kelly's hardware store where she always has the item that they need. Once they have the items needed for the repair, they go back to the work-site and sing \\"We Work Together\\" while performing the repairs. In each episode, the item is fixed. Episodes Characters Humans * Manny (full name Manuel Estevez Garcia III); voiced by Wilmer Valderrama) – A Mexican-American repairman who lives in Sheet Rock Hills. He has brown eyes and brown hair, and carries a pencil behind his ear. He wears a red and white hat, a green shirt, blue jeans, boots, and a yellow tool belt with a silver buckle. * Kelly (voiced by Nancy Truman) – A hardware store owner. She lives in Sheet Rock Hills with her friends and family. Kelly has a teenage brother named Elliot. It was explained in various episodes that Kelly loves keeping toys behind her desk for Manny and the tools to give to Chico and Pepe as gifts. Her family name is Crenshaw. Kelly almost always has the materials that Manny and the tools need for their projects. * Mr. Lopart (full name Leonard Francis Lopart; voiced by Tom Kenny) – The owner of a candy store next to Manny's workshop. He is a middle-aged man who lives a happy life with his cat Fluffy (also voiced by Tom Kenny). His mother is Mrs. Lopart (who is voiced by Marion Ross) and he has twin nephews named Lyle and Leland. * Fix-It – A robotic dog who lives in Manny's shop and is most likely to be Squeeze's best friend. Tools * Felipe (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui) – A yellow Phillips-head screwdriver (hence his name) who always considers himself to be a very important tool. He is always overconfident and popular about himself. He sometimes thinks of himself as a superhero. Sometimes, his ideas make a problem worse. He provides a lot of the Spanish language content in the show, translating for the other tools. He also loves to sing but is not very good at it. He usually gets under Turner's skin and his headache, sometimes purposely. He bonds with Flicker and tries to bond with Turner. He also bonds with Pat sometimes. * Turner (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) – A violet flat-head screwdriver who appears to be sarcastic and is bossy to Felipe, usually going against Felipe's overconfidence. There are some cases where he shows a genuinely caring relationship with Felipe. In the season one episode \\"Supremoguy\\", Felipe needs rescuing and Turner is the first to say \\"I'll get ya\\". Also in the episode \\"Breakfast of Champions\\", when Felipe feels worn out, he shows genuine concern for him. He appears to have a secret soft spot for babies and animals (including birds, kittens, and butterflies) and for dancing, even crying in \\"Handy Manny & The 7 Tools\\", although he loudly denies it. In the episode \\"Tools for Toys\\", he is easily liked by Mr. Singh's daughter, Leela. In the same episode, she kisses him at the top of the head and he blushes. Turner loses his patience with Pat due to his lack of intelligence and with Rusty due to his fear of many things. * Pat (voiced by Tom Kenny) – A sky blue claw hammer who is talkative, extremely silly and dumb, an idealistic tool, clumsy and not so intelligent, though he does have flashes of cleverness from time to time. He sometimes finds it hard to control his strength. His catchphrase is \\"I'm a hammer\\". He is obsessed with nails. It is hinted that he is Rusty's best friend because he is usually the first to comfort him. His lack of intelligence annoys Turner. * Dusty (voiced by Kath Soucie) – A red hand saw who is very smart and gives good advice. She acts as the big sister of the group and is very good with detective work by solving mysteries. She also bonds with almost all the other tools. Dusty doesn't have eyelashes despite the fact she is a female tool except when she dresses as a ballerina; which consists of a bow and a tutu. Her talent is ballet. * Squeeze (voiced by Nika Futterman) – A green pair of pliers. She loves to lend a helping hand, and is sometimes impatient to fix something (usually repairs that involve bolts). She also appears to be giggly, girly, and preppy. Her childlike cuteness makes her a very loveable tool. Before Flicker was introduced, she was considered the baby among the tools. * Stretch (also voiced by Nika Futterman) – A pink tape measure who loves to measure things. He can speak out accurate measurements, has a very mathematical mind, has a good memory, He knows everything especially for numbers and measurements and can use his tape as an extendable hand. He bonds with almost every tool. He speaks with a lisp. * Rusty (voiced by Fred Stoller) – An orange monkey wrench who is not very brave and is a worrier and frightened of everything, generally being frightened of pretty much anything. Most of the time he needs reassurance from his fellow tools and Manny. It is hinted that Pat is his best friend because he is usually the first to comfort him. Sometimes his fear of stuff allows the others to lose patience with him, mainly Turner. He bonds with Pat, Dusty, and Squeeze. He is the second-oldest tool but his intense fear of stuff makes him seem younger than he really is. In \\"Firefighter Manny\\", Rusty knows how to be not scared to be a firefighter tool. * Flicker (voiced by Grey DeLisle) – Manny's youngest tool (first appearing in season 2) is a marigold and blue flashlight who speaks Spanish and is still learning English (In Tagalog version, he speaks English and learning Tagalog), slowly picking up more of the language throughout season 3. He flashes his light whenever he feels excited. In Handy Manny's School for Tools, he seems to be fully bilingual. He is shown to love food. He has freckles and Felipe has to translate what he says sometimes. * Zip (voiced by Eddie Deezen) – One of the automobic team in \\"The Tools New Team\\". He first met Stretch and Felipe. He talks fast, knows it all and works super fast as Spinner and Felipe. Zip is a power socket tool. * Sneeze (voiced by Tom Kenny) – A aquamarine and orange vacuum cleaner and one of the automobic team. He sneezes saw dust and other things. In The Tools New Team, Manny meets Sneeze hiding in one of the boxes. He has a long nose as an elephant and his dream is to become an actor in \\"Handy Manny & The 7 Tools\\". He is also friends with Elliot. His first appearance is \\"The Tools New Team\\". * Ticks and Totts (voiced by Jesse Corti and Cristobal Parson) – Two socket wrench twin brothers. They each speak English and Spanish. They both meet Dusty and Flicker as they overheard them. They each has six sides like fixing Marcelo's bike. They are one of the automobic team. * Roland (voiced by Bill Fagerbakke) – The biggest, giant, red rolling toolbox. He can be clumsy like Pat and he forgets all the time. His snoring is so loud. He also carries the automobic team. His drawers are often seen opened with the automobic team inside the drawers. He is shown to be gluttonous as shown when he ate the chips when serving food and beverages on the plane in \\"Hank's Birthday\\". Roland meets Pat and Squeeze. He is one of the automobic team. * Lefty, Lily, & Junior (voiced by Mark Decarlo, Grey DeLisle and Kath Soucie) – Combination wrenches and a happy family. Lefty is orange and he is a father. Lily is yellow and she is a mother. And Junior is their son and he is light blue. They all met Turner and Rusty. Lily can be emotional at times. Lily is overprotective to Junior. Junior can be shy sometimes. Lefty knows that Junior can do his best. He is also shown to have a close father-son relationship with Junior as well. Junior is as cheerful as Squeeze. They are part of the automobic team. * Beamer (voiced by Steve Moreno) – A wobbly laser level. He first appeared in \\"Art Show\\" at Kelly's hardware store. Beamer knows how to straighten things out. Beamer later got adopted by Carmella as her own tool. * Spinner (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui) – One of the two power tools.

Life Crockford was born 13 January 1776 in Temple Bar, London, the son of a fishmonger, and for some time himself carried on that business. He married firstly (1801) Mary Lockwood and secondly (20 May 1812 St George's Hanover Square) Sarah Frances Douglass. After winning a large sum of money (according to one story, £100,000) either at cards or by running a gambling establishment, he built a luxurious gambling house designed by Benjamin and Philip Wyatt at 50-53 St James's Street in 1827. In order to ensure exclusiveness, he organised the house as a members' club under the name \\"The St James's Club\\" though popularly known as \\"Crockford's Club\\" and it quickly became the rage - every English social celebrity and every distinguished foreigner visiting London hastened to become a member. Even the Duke of Wellington joined, though it is alleged this was in order merely to blackball his son, Lord Douro, should he seek election. Hazard was the favourite game, and very large sums changed hands. Crockford retired in 1840, when, in the expressive language of Captain Rees Howell Gronow, he had \\"won the whole of the ready money of the then existing generation.\\" He took approximately £1,200,000 out of the club, but subsequently invested some of it unwisely, particularly with two of his sons and one daughter (Henry, Charles and Fanny Crockford) in mining and zinc manufacturing in Greenfield, Flintshire, Wales. Death Crockford died at his home 11 Carlton House Terrace (later Prime Minister Gladstone's home) on 24 May 1844. and lies buried in a family vault underneath Kensal Green Cemetery Chapel London.Crockford-Hawley Bibliography *John Timbs Club Life of London (London 1866) *R.H.Gronow Celebrities of London and Paris, 3rd series (London 1865) *Henry Waddy \\"The Devonshire Club and Crockford's\\" (Nash 1919) *Frank Siltzer \\"Newmarket its Sport and Personalities\\" (Cassell 1923) *Rupert Mackeson \\"Bet Like a Man\\" (Eye 2001) *Harold Clunn \\"The Face of London\\" (Spring Books) *John Raymond \\"The Reminiscences of Captain Gronow ... 1810-60\\" (The Bodley Head 1964) *Ralph Nevill \\"London Clubs\\" (Chatto & Windus 1911) *Ralph Nevill \\"Romantic London\\" (Cassell 1928) *Ralph Nevill \\"The Man of Pleasure\\" (Chatto & Windus 1912) *Jane Ridley \\"The Young Disraeli 1804-1846\\" (Sinclair-Stevenson 1995) *St James's : a Satirical Poem in Six Epistles to Mr Crockford\\" (London 1827) *E.J.Burford \\"Royal St James's - being a story of kings, clubmen and courtesans\\" (Hale 1988) *E.Beresford Chancellor \\"Memorials of St James's Street\\" (Grant Richards 1922) *Henry Blyth \\"Hell & Hazard or William Crockford versus the Gentlemen of England\\" (Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1969) *Hunter Davies \\"The New London Spy\\" (Anthony Blond) *W.Teignmouth Shore \\"D'Orsay of the Complete Dandy\\" (Long 1911) *Arthur Bryant \\"The Age of Elegance 1812-1822\\" (Collins 1950) *Stella Margetson \\"Leisure and Pleasure in the Nineteenth Century\\" (Cassell 1969) *Simon Dewes \\"Temple Bar Tapestry\\" (Rich & Cowan) *A.L.Humphreys \\"Crockford's or the Goddess of Chance in St James's Street 1828-1844\\" (Hutchinson 1953) *Michael Sadler \\"Blessington-D'Orsay - a Masquerade\\" (Constable 1933 & 1947) *\\"Bentley's Miscellany\\" VolXV 1844 *\\"Crockford-House; A Rhapsody in Two Cantos\\" (Murray 1827) *Charles Evans \\"The Legend of the Crockford Treasure - a play for children\\" (Cressrelles) *Connery Chappell \\"Two pleasures For Your Choosing - the World of William Crockford\\" (Falcon Press 1951) *T.H.S.Escott \\"The Romance of the West-End & Other Social Clubs\\" (Unwin 1914) *John o'London \\"London Stories\\" (Bracken 1985 reprint of 1882 publication) *Yves-Michel Ergal \\"Jeux d'Enfer\\" (Calmann-Levy 1992) Historical novel in French *G.E.Mingay \\"Georgian London\\" (Batsford 1975) *David Piper \\"London\\" (Book Club 1964) *Harold Clunn \\"The Face of London\\" (Spring 1950s) *Gabriel Orozco \\"Empty Club\\" (Artangel 1966) *Tony Byles \\"In Search of Running Rein\\" (Apex 2011) *Nicholas Foulkes \\"Gentlemen and Blackguards\\" (Phoenix 2010) *D.J.Taylor \\"Derby Day\\" (Vintage 2011) *John P.Birchill \\"Early Industrialists in Flintshire\\" (web) *Rowland Tennant \\"A History of Holywell & Greenfield\\" (Bridgebooks 2007) *J.R.Thomas \\"The Tramways and Railways to Holywell\\" (1995) *Ken Davies \\"Maritime Wales No 35\\" (Gwynedd Council 2014) References ;Attribution * External links Category:English businesspeople Category:English gamblers Category:1776 births Category:1844 deaths ","title":"William Crockford"},{"id":"6889037","text":"This page is a list of notable Asian Americans.

This differs from paleoclimatology which encompasses climate change over the entire history of Earth. These historical impacts of climate change can improve human life and cause societies to flourish, or can be instrumental in civilization's societal collapse. The study seeks to define periods in human history where temperature or precipitation varied from what is observed in the present day. The primary sources include written records such as sagas, chronicles, maps and local history literature as well as pictorial representations such as paintings, drawings and even rock art. The archaeological record is equally important in establishing evidence of settlement, water and land usage. Techniques In literate societies, historians may find written evidence of climatic variations over hundreds or thousands of years, such as phenological records of natural processes, for example viticultural records of grape harvest dates. In preliterate or non-literate societies, researchers must rely on other techniques to find evidence of historical climate differences. Past population levels and habitable ranges of humans or plants and animals may be used to find evidence of past differences in climate for the region. Palynology, the study of pollens, can show not only the range of plants and to reconstruct possible ecology, but to estimate the amount of precipitation in a given time period, based on the abundance of pollen in that layer of sediment or ice. Role in human evolution Changes in East African climate have been associated with the evolution of hominini. Researchers have proposed that the regional environment transitioned from humid jungle to more arid grasslands due to tectonic uplift and changes in broader patterns of ocean and atmospheric circulation. This environmental change is believed to have forced hominins to evolve for life in a savannah-type environment. Some data suggest that this environmental change caused the development of modern homimin features; however there exist other data that show that morphological changes in the earliest hominins occurred while the region was still forested. Rapid tectonic uplift likely occurred in the early Pleistocene, changing the local elevation and broadly reorganizing the regional patterns of atmospheric circulation. This can be correlated with the rapid hominin evolution of the Quaternary period. Changes in climate at 2.8, 1.7, and 1.0 million years ago correlate well with observed transitions between recognized hominin species. It is difficult to differentiate correlation from causality in these paleopanthropological and paleoclimatological reconstructions, so these results must be interpreted with caution and related to the appropriate time- scales and uncertainties. Ice ages The eruption of the Toba supervolcano, 70,000 to 75,000 years ago reduced the average global temperature by 5 degrees Celsius for several years and may have triggered an ice age. It has been postulated that this created a bottleneck in human evolution. A much smaller but similar effect occurred after the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, when global temperatures fell for about 5 years in a row. Before the retreat of glaciers at the start of the Holocene (~9600 BC), ice sheets covered much of the northern latitudes and sea levels were much lower than they are today. The start of our present interglacial period appears to have helped spur the development of human civilization.  Role in human migration and agriculture  Climate change has been linked to human migration from as early as the end of the Pleistocene to the early twenty-first century. The effect of climate on available resources and living conditions such as food, water, and temperature drove the movement of populations and determined the ability for groups to begin a system of agriculture or continue a foraging lifestyle. Groups such as the inhabitants of northern Peru and central Chile, the Saqqaq in Greenland, nomadic Eurasian tribes in Historical China, and the Natufian culture in the Levant all display migration reactions due to climactic change.  Further descriptions of specific cases  In northern Peru and central Chile climate change is cited as the driving force in a series of migration patterns from about 15,000 B.C. to approximately 4,500 B.C. Between 11,800 B.C. and 10,500 B.C. evidence suggests seasonal migration from high to low elevation by the natives while conditions permitted a humid environment to persist in both areas. Around 9,000 B.C. the lakes that periodically served as a home to the natives dried up and were abandoned until 4,500 B.C. This period of abandonment is a blank segment of the archeological record known in Spanish as the silencio arqueológico. During this break, there exists no evidence of activity by the natives in the lakes area. The correlation between climate and migratory patterns leads historians to believe the Central Chilean natives favored humid, low-elevation areas especially during periods of increased aridity. The different inhabitants of Greenland, specifically in the west, migrated primarily in response to temperature change. The Saqqaq people arrived in Greenland around 4,500 B.P. and experienced moderate temperature variation for the first 1,100 years of occupation; near 3,400 B.P. a cooling period began that pushed the Saqqaq toward the west. A similar temperature fluctuation occurred around 2,800 B.P. that led to the abandonment of the inhabited Saqqaq region; this temperature shift was a decrease in temperature of about 4 °C over 200 years. Following the Saqqaq dominance, other groups such as the Dorset people inhabited west Greenland; the Dorset were sea-ice hunters that had tools adapted to the colder environment. The Dorset appeared to leave the region around 2,200 B.P. without clear connection to the changing environment. Following the Dorset occupation, the Norse began to appear around 1,100 B.P. in west Greenland during a significant warming period. However, a sharp decrease in temperature beginning in 850 B.P. of about 4 °C in 80 years is thought to contribute to the demise of initial Norse occupation in western Greenland. In Historical China over the past 2,000 years, migration patterns have centered around precipitation change and temperature fluctuation. Pastoralists moved in order to feed the livestock that they cared for and to forage for themselves in more plentiful areas. During dry periods or cooling periods the nomadic lifestyle became more prevalent because pastoralists were seeking more fertile ground. The precipitation was a more defining factor than temperature in terms of its effects on migration. The trend of the migrating Chinese showed that the northern pastoralists were more affected by the fluctuation in precipitation than the southern nomads. In a majority of cases, pastoralists migrated further southward during changes in precipitation. These movements were not classified by one large event or a specific era of movement; rather, the relationship between climate and nomadic migration is relevant from \\"a long term perspective and on a large spatial scale.\\" The Natufian population in the Levant was subject to two major climactic changes that influenced the development and separation of their culture. As a consequence of increased temperature, the expansion of the Mediterranean woodlands occurred approximately 13,000 years ago; with that expansion came a shift to sedentary foraging adopted by the surrounding population. Thus, a migration toward the higher-elevation woodlands took place and remained constant for nearly 2,000 years. This era ended when the climate became more arid and the Mediterranean forest shrank 11,000 years ago. Upon this change, some of the Natufian populations nearest sustainable land transitioned into an agricultural way of life; sustainable land was primarily near water sources. Those groups that did not reside near a stable resource returned to the nomadic foraging that was prevalent prior to sedentary life. Historical and prehistoric societies The rise and fall of societies have often been linked to environmental factors. Evidence of a warm climate in Europe, for example, comes from archaeological studies of settlement and farming in the Early Bronze Age at altitudes now beyond cultivation, such as Dartmoor, Exmoor, the Lake district and the Pennines in Great Britain. The climate appears to have deteriorated towards the Late Bronze Age however. Settlements and field boundaries have been found at high altitude in these areas, which are now wild and uninhabitable. Grimspound on Dartmoor is well preserved and shows the standing remains of an extensive settlement in a now inhospitable environment. Some parts of the present Saharan desert may have been populated when the climate was cooler and wetter, judging by cave art and other signs of settlement in Prehistoric Central North Africa. Societal growth and urbanization Approximately one millennium after the 7 ka slowing of sea- level rise, many coastal urban centers rose to prominence around the world. It has been hypothesized that this is correlated with the development of stable coastal environments and ecosystems and an increase in marine productivity (also related to an increase in temperatures), which would provide a food source for hierarchical urban societies. Societal collapse Norse Greenlanders are from a 1408 marriage in Hvalsey Church — today the best- preserved of the Norse ruins. Climate change has been associated with the historical collapse of civilizations, cities and dynasties. Notable examples of this include the Anasazi, Classic Maya, the Harappa, the Hittites, and Ancient Egypt. Other, smaller communities such as the Viking settlement of Greenland have also suffered collapse with climate change being a suggested contributory factor. There are two proposed methods of Classic Maya collapse: environmental and non-environmental. The environmental approach uses paleoclimatic evidence to show that movements in the intertropical convergence zone likely caused severe, extended droughts during a few time periods at the end of the archaeological record for the classic Maya. The non-environmental approach suggests that the collapse could be due to increasing class tensions associated with the building of monumental architecture and the corresponding decline of agriculture, increased disease, and increased internal warfare. The Harappa and Indus civilizations were affected by drought 4,500–3,500 years ago. A decline in rainfall in the Middle East and Northern India 3,800–2,500 is likely to have affected the Hittites and Ancient Egypt. Medieval Warm Period The Medieval Warm Period was a time of warm weather between about AD 800–1300, during the European Medieval period. Archaeological evidence supports studies of the Norse sagas which describe the settlement of Greenland in the 9th century AD of land now quite unsuitable for cultivation. For example, excavations at one settlement site have shown the presence of birch trees during the early Viking period. In the case of the Norse, the Medieval warm period was associated with the Norse age of exploration and Arctic colonization, and the later colder periods led to the decline of those colonies. The same period records the discovery of an area called Vinland, probably in North America, which may also have been warmer than at present, judging by the alleged presence of grape vines. Little Ice Age Later examples include the Little Ice Age, well documented by paintings, documents (such as diaries) and events such as the River Thames frost fairs held on frozen lakes and rivers in the 17th and 18th centuries. The River Thames was made more narrow and flowed faster after old London Bridge was demolished in 1831, and the river was embanked in stages during the 19th century, both of which made the river less liable to freezing. Among the earliest references to the coming climate change is an entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle dated 1046: *\\"And in this same year after the 2nd of February came the severe winter with frost and snow, and with all kinds of bad weather, so that there was no man alive who could remember so severe a winter as that, both through mortality of men and disease of cattle; both birds and fishes perished through the great cold and hunger.\\" The Chronicle is the single most important historical source for the period in England between the departure of the Romans and the decades following the Norman Conquest. Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere. The Frozen Thames, 1677 The Little Ice Age brought colder winters to parts of Europe and North America. In the mid-17th century, glaciers in the Swiss Alps advanced, gradually engulfing farms and crushing entire villages. The River Thames and the canals and rivers of the Netherlands often froze over during the winter, and people skated and even held frost fairs on the ice. The first Thames frost fair was in 1607; the last in 1814, although changes to the bridges and the addition of an embankment affected the river flow and depth, diminishing the possibility of freezes. The freeze of the Golden Horn and the southern section of the Bosphorus took place in 1622. In 1658, a Swedish army marched across the Great Belt to Denmark to invade Copenhagen. The Baltic Sea froze over, enabling sledge rides from Poland to Sweden, with seasonal inns built on the way. The winter of 1794/1795 was particularly harsh when the French invasion army under Pichegru could march on the frozen rivers of the Netherlands, while the Dutch fleet was fixed in the ice in Den Helder harbour. In the winter of 1780, New York Harbour froze, allowing people to walk from Manhattan to Staten Island. Sea ice surrounding Iceland extended for miles in every direction, closing that island's harbours to shipping. The severe winters affected human life in ways large and small. The population of Iceland fell by half, but this was perhaps also due to fluorosis caused by the eruption of the volcano Laki in 1783. Iceland also suffered failures of cereal crops and people moved away from a grain-based diet. The Norse colonies in Greenland starved and vanished (by the 15th century) as crops failed and livestock could not be maintained through increasingly harsh winters, though Jared Diamond noted that they had exceeded the agricultural carrying capacity before then. In North America, American Indians formed leagues in response to food shortages. In Southern Europe, in Portugal, snow storms were much more frequent while today they are rare. There are reports of heavy snowfalls in the winters of 1665, 1744 and 1886. In contrast to its uncertain beginning, there is a consensus that the Little Ice Age ended in the mid-19th century. Evidence of anthropogenic climate change Through deforestation and agriculture, some scientists have proposed a human component in some historical climatic changes. Human-started fires have been implicated in the transformation of much of Australia from grassland to desert. If true, this would show that non-industrialized societies could have a role in influencing regional climate. Deforestation, desertification and the salinization of soils may have contributed to or caused other climatic changes throughout human history.

His works were critical of corruption and social structures. He studied theater at Columbia and Yale Universities. He was professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the Universidad de Concepción.  Career   As playwright  Vodanovic was born in Split, Croatia in 1926.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0900766/bio Shortly after he moved to Chile. His first works were light comedies acted by commercial theater companies. In 1959, Vodanović began to write for the university theaters, leading to a change in style. He adopted a neorealistic style, critically representing diverse aspects of the socio-political reality of his country through drama and comedy. His first such was the social drama Deja que los perros ladren (\\"Let the dogs bark\\"), which analyzed from a social and psychological point of view the phenomenon of corruption in the Chilean middle class. Viña, subtitled Tres comedias en traje de baño (\\"Three comedies in a bathing suit\\"), satirically portrayed the upper class's relationship with other classes of society.  As screenwriter  In 1982, he wrote a miniseries for Canal 13 entitled Una familia feliz. It was not until 1984, when his first telenovela Los títeres aired that he became known as a screenwriter. His television series were commercially successful while also intellectual, carefully disguising references to the Chilean socio-political context of the 1980s.

It forms a large peninsula extending into the Gulf of Fonseca. The summit is truncated by a large caldera, 2 x 2.4 km in diameter and 500 m deep, holding a substantial crater lake (Laguna Cosigüina). This cone has grown within an earlier caldera, forming a somma volcano. The earlier caldera rim is still exposed on the north side, but has been buried by the younger cone elsewhere. Activity The volcano last erupted in 1859, but its most famous activity occurred on January 20, 1835, when it produced the largest historical eruption in Nicaragua. Ash from the 1835 eruption has been found in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Jamaica. According to an analysis by Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature, the 1835 eruption caused a temporary decrease in the average land temperature of Earth of about 0.75 degrees C.Berkeley Earth Releases New Analysis , 29 July 2012 It has not erupted since 1859, only an instant in terms of geological time. An earthquake swarm was measured near Cosigüina in 2002, indicating that tectonic forces are still active in the region although the volcano is somewhat isolated from the line of more recently active Central American volcanoes to the northwest and southeast. The only indicators of hydrothermal activity at the volcano are intermittently observed gas bubbles in Laguna Cosigüina and a hot spring along the eastern flank of the volcano. The fairly uniform vegetation cover on the volcano's sides also attests to a general lack of gas emissions or “hot spots” on the 872-meter-high cone.

Epperson claimed to have first created an ice pop in 1905, at the age of 11, when he accidentally left a glass of powdered lemonade soda and water with a mixing stick in it on his porch during a cold night, a story still printed on the back of Popsicle treat boxes. Epperson lived in Oakland and worked as a lemonade salesman. In 1922, Epperson, a realtor with Realty Syndicate Company in Oakland, introduced the Popsicle at a fireman's ball. The product got traction quickly; in 1923, at the age of 29, Epperson received a patent for his \\"Epsicle\\" ice pop, and by 1924, had patented all handled, frozen confections or ice lollipops. He officially debuted the Epsicle in seven fruit flavors at Neptune Beach amusement park, marketed as a \\"frozen lollipop,\\" or a \\"drink on a stick.\\" A couple years later, Epperson sold the rights to the invention and the Popsicle brand to the Joe Lowe Company in New York City. Terminology Popsicle Stick Castle made with 296,000 popsicle sticks In the United States and Canada frozen ice on a stick is generically referred to as a popsicle due to the early popularity of the Popsicle brand, and the word has become a genericized trademark to mean any ice pop or freezer pop, regardless of brand or format.\\"8 Common Words That Are Still Trademarked: Popsicle.\\" at Merriam-Webster.com. Retrieved 10 August 2018. \\"It might be surprising, but Popsicle is trademarked...\\"Martha Cooper and William L. Nothstine. Power Persuasion: Moving an Ancient Art Into the Media Age. Educational Video Group, 1992. p. 159: \\"...what would we call those sweet icy treats on a stick if we did not have the name 'Popsicle'?\\" (The word is a portmanteau of pop and icicle; the word is genericized to such an extent that there are decades-old derived slang meanings such as \\"popsicle stand\\".Jonathon Green. Cassell's Dictionary of Slang. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., 2005. p. 1123.) They are also called an ice pop or freezer pop in the United States. In the Caicos Islands it is referred to as an ice saver. In the United Kingdom and Ireland the terms ice lolly and ice pop are used, though ice pop is much more common in Ireland. Chihiro is used as a slang term in the Cayman Islands, partially derived from chill. Different parts of Australia use either ice block or icy pole, and New Zealand uses ice block. Paletas After a trip to the United States in the early 1940s Ignacio Alcázar returned to his home city of Tocumbo, Michoacán, México, bringing the idea to manufacture ice pops or paletas (little sticks) using locally available fresh fruit. He and some family members expanded by opening a shop in Mexico City which became very popular and he began to franchise Paletería La Michoacana to friends and family from his town. The popularity of Paletas and association with Tocumbo has increased to the status of a national Mexican food. Paleta flavors can be divided into two basic categories: milk based or water based. The composition of each flavor may vary, but the base is most often fruit. Paleterias usually have dozens of flavors of paleta including local flavors like horchata, tamarind, mamey and nanche along with other flavors like strawberry, lime, chocolate and mango. Distinctly Mexican ingredients like chili pepper, chamoy, and vanilla are often present in these paletas. Paleterias adapt their flavors to the tastes of the community and local availability of ingredients. Paleteros A paletero in Denver, Colorado A paletero (roughly equivalent to the English \\"ice cream man\\"), is a street seller of paletas and other frozen treats, usually from a pushcart labeled with the name of the enterprise that made the paletas (paletería). Today, many paleteros are now commonly found in American cities with significant Mexican populations. Vending requirements for paleteros vary widely by city. In San Jose, California, in 1988, a permit to sell paletas cost about $154. Homemade ice pops An ice pop made using a mold An alternative to the store-bought ice pops is making them at home using fruit juice, drinks, or any freezable beverage. A classic method involves using ice cube trays and toothpicks, although various ice pop freezer molds are also available. In the UK, there is an increasing number of people making alcoholic ice lollies at home by putting alcoholic drinks inside the mould. Buckfast, Kopparberg and Strongbow Dark Fruit ciders are popular choices used. Innovations in ice pop creation In 2018, the UK food-focused design firm called Bompas & Parr announced that they had created the world's first 'non- melting' ice pop. The ice pop does melt but not as fast as other ice pops. This is due to the strands of fruit fibers inside the ice pops which makes them thicker than regular ice pops. The thicker the ice pop the slower it melts. This design was inspired by the material called pykrete, which was invented by Geoffrey Pyke. World record ice pop On June 22, 2005, Snapple tried to beat the existing Guinness World Records entry of a 1997 Dutch ice pop by attempting to erect a ice pop in New York City. The of frozen juice that had been brought from Edison, New Jersey, in a freezer truck melted faster than expected, dashing hopes of a new record. Spectators fled to higher ground as firefighters hosed away the melted juice.

Topography The spine of the Central Fells runs on a north–south axis with the high point at High Raise. A complex system of daleheads to the east of this apex resolves itself into Calf Crag, a broad- topped ridge featuring a number of rocky tops. Calf Crag is bounded by Wythburndale to the north and by its upper gathering grounds to the west. Far Easedale lies to the south while the head of Greenburn forms the eastern face, both of these sides being craggy. The Wyth Burn flows north east into Thirlmere while Far Easedale Gill and Green Burn descend to the River Rothay and ultimately to Windermere. Calf Crag thus stands on the main north-south watershed of the Lakeland Fells. The summit plateau, about a mile across, sends two narrow eastern ridges to the north and south of Greenburn Bottom. The former leads to Steel Fell, while the southern spur passes over Gibson Knott before ending at Helm Crag. Southwest from Calf Crag the ground rises over rocky terrain to Sergeant Man and High Raise, although this could hardly be termed a ridge. Geology Much of Calf Crag is covered by Quaternary deposits although the summit knoll is an outcrop of the Lincomb Tarn Formation. This is composed of dacitic lapilli-tuff with andesite sills. The eastern crags at Pike of Carrs display the underlying Esk Pike Formation of volcaniclastic sandstone.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Summit The summit is a rocky knoll with a small crag directly to the south. There is a tidy cairn although the patch of rushes noted by Wainwright is no longer in evidence.Mark Richards: The Central Fells: Collins (2003): A tarn lies between here and a subsidiary top to the west. The view is heavily restricted by higher fells westward, but there is a fine vista of the lake of Grasmere with the Helvellyn range rising behind. Paths on the fell follow the routes to Steel Fell, Gibson Knott and Sergeant Man. A bridleway over Greenup Edge (a section of the Coast to Coast Walk) passes southwest of the top as it leads from Borrowdale to Far Easedale. Ascents Grasmere village is the most convenient starting point with approaches possible along either Far Easedale or Green Burn. The latter makes a direct assault up a grassy strip between Pike of Carrs and Rough Crag, while the Far Easedale route gains the ridge 'behind' the summit. Beginning from the head of Thirlmere a way can also be made up Wythburndale, although this will involve a certain amount of bog-hopping.

It is located in Telica municipality, in the León department of Nicaragua. One of Nicaragua's most active volcanoes, Telica has erupted frequently, and ash from those frequent eruptions keeps the slopes of its cone bare of vegetation. Volcanism Telica has six cones, the tallest of which is 1061 meters high. There is a double crater at the top, 700 meters wide and 120 meters deep. Telica has erupted frequently since the Spanish Era. The last eruption was on July 29, 2020. Telica's largest recorded eruption, in 1529, had a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 4. Telica became active in August 1999. An eruption produced ash-fall, and on 18 August a lava lake was observed in the summit crater. The ash eruptions continued until February 2000 and declined afterwards. From 9 January to February 2007, small ash eruptions produced ash clouds reaching altitudes of 4900 ft (1.5 km). In the afternoon of 7 May 2015, Telica increased its volcanic activity, with explosions and low-intensity earthquakes. These explosions produced gas emissions and volcanic ash. On the night of 10 May, an explosive eruption occurred, dusting nearby towns with ash. The volcano registered numerous small eruptions over the succeeding months, including one which caused ash fall in León on September 23. No major damage or injuries were reported. Tourism The general proximity to the city of León makes Telica a popular tourist attraction. Most hikes enter through the small town of San Jacinto, known for its bubbling mud pits and small geothermal electric generation plant.

Twirling is a form of object manipulation where an object is twirled by one or two hands, the fingers or by other parts of the body. Twirling practice manipulates the object in circular or near circular patterns. It can also be done indirectly by the use of another object or objects as in the case of devil stick manipulation where handsticks are used. Twirling is performed as a hobby, sport, exercise or performance. Types Twirling includes a wide variety of practices that use different equipment or props. All props are 'stick' or simulated stick shape and are rotated during the activity. The types of twirling are arranged alphabetically. Astrowheeling Astrowheeling is a form of twirling used as personal exercise for improving dexterity, focus and balance. By using a heavy spinning wheel with handles, astrowheeling combines the aesthetics of twirling and the resistance of spinning wheels into a form of practical exercise. It was inspired by ancient practices that manipulate the rotational inertia of spinning objects in order to develop balance, focus, and control. The current trend of astrowheeling, which uses \\"bike-like\\" wheels, was popularized in the 1980s in North America.Astrowheeling: Space-age twirling (Hardcover) by Charles Roy Schroeder, Memphis State University Press; 1st edition (1979) . Baton twirling Baton twirling, Manzanar War Relocation Center, 1943. Photographed by Ansel Adams. Baton twirling has expanded beyond parades and is now more comparable to rhythmic gymnastics (see below). The sport is popular in many countries including the United States, Japan, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Canada. Many countries compete each year at the World Baton Twirling Championships. The sport of baton twirling is a relatively new discipline that has evolved through many dimensions. The distinguishing fundamental characteristics are: Handling of the baton instrument to create visual images, pictures and patterns, executed with dexterity, smoothness, fluidity, and speed, both close in and around the body and by releasing the baton into the air. Expression of the body through dance and movement to create a demonstration of strength, flexibility, physical fitness, beauty, aesthetics, and harmony in coordination with the manipulation of the baton. The incorporation of gymnastic movements adapted to baton twirling to create additional elements of risk and excitement. The discipline requires the simultaneous blending of these fundamental characteristics all set to music, utilizing time and space to display both technical merit and artistic expression in creating a total package for the viewer’s eye. Baton twirling is an entertaining and exciting sport to watch. The intricate timing and precision required to perform these feats is difficult. Baton twirling requires complete concentration and coordination. It demands top physical conditioning. Baton twirling encompasses the physical stamina and agility of gymnastics and dance, the beauty of figure skating and ballet, and the technical skill of all these sports combined. The distinguishing fundamental characteristics are: Handling of the baton instrument to create visual images, pictures and patterns, executed with dexterity, smoothness, fluidity, and speed, both close in and around the body and by releasing the baton into the air. Routines for competitive sport baton twirling are designed for athletes of novice through elite stages of development, experience and ability. Individual competitive events utilize one-baton, two-baton, or three-baton to standardized music while Group competitive events are performed with members twirling together with precision and unison. Also there are pair and group events which include Freestyle Pairs and Freestyle Team at the highest level. Groups utilize their own pre-recorded music. Professionally trained and certified WBTF Judges adjudicate the competitions. One of the highest honors in twirling is winning \\"WBTF Gold Medalist.\\" Origins: Baton twirling started in Eastern Europe and Asia. It is thought it started at dance festivals where the goers used knives, guns, torches and sticks to twirl with and toss. The \\"activity\\" progressed into the armies of some countries which twirled with rifles during marches. When the army was parading, they added a rifle twirler to the front of the marchers. The rifle was then switched for a \\"mace\\". The mace was much larger than the batons of today and imbalanced. They are still used by some marching bands at parades nowadays. The mace barer or \\"drum major\\" twirled the baton whilst leading the army or band. This was very popular in the United States following World War II with the American Legion Bands and the Fireman’s Bands. The maces were altered for easier twirling and now resemble the batons. They were given smaller ends of light rubber, made from hollow light metal and balanced to give accuracy to the twirler. It is thought it was the involvement of females (\\"drum majorettes\\") and the progression of twirling that resulted in the lightening and balancing of the baton. The sport came to North America when Major Millsap’s created baton twirling when he established Millsap's College in the United States in Mississippi after the Civil War. While many member countries have their own national organizations, the World Baton Twirling Federation governs the sport of baton twirling on an international level. Pen spinning A combination of pen spinning tricks. Pen spinning -- using one's fingers to manipulate an ordinary inexpensive writing-pen -- can be performed anywhere. Sometimes classified as a form of contact juggling, pen spinning may also include tossing and catching of the pen. Called \\"rōnin mawashi\\" in Japan, where it is popular among the per-collegiate community, pen twirling has its stars, as does any other performance or skill. Accomplished masters of the art form that are well known -- at least among those who follow the sport -- have developed a reputation for creation of certain signature 'moves'. David Weis is credited with creating numerous 'back' style moves, such as the \\"BackAround\\". Hideaki Kondoh is generally credited with giving the pen trick \\"Sonic\\" its name, because of the way the pen would blur in his fingers. Penspinning only recently saw a rapid increase in recognition due to the emergence of internet media websites such as YouTube. From 2006 onwards, the art of Penspinning has developed subcultures in many countries of the world including the Asiatic- regions and Europe (France, Germany and Poland). Poi Poi is a form of juggling, dance or performance art, accomplished using balls, or various other weights, on ropes or chains -- held in each hand, and swung in various circular patterns, similar to club-twirling. It was originally practiced by the Māori people of New Zealand (the word poi means \\"ball\\"). Rhythmic gymnastics Combining elements of ballet, gymnastics, theatrical dance, and apparatus manipulation, Rhythmic Gymnastics, once largely considered a sport for women and girls, is growing in popularity among men as well. The Japanese's version of Men's rhythmic gymnastics includes tumbling and is performed on a spring floor. Men compete in four types of apparatus: rope, stick, double rings and clubs. Groups do not use any apparatus. Japan hosted the first men's world championships in 2003. Rhythmic gymnastics as a sport began in the 1940s in the former Soviet Union. It was there that for the first time, the spirit of sports was combined with the sensuous art of classical ballet. (To Isadora Duncan, we credit the famous rebellion against the dogma of classical ballet and the shift toward the creation of a new discipline that would blend art and sport.) Recognized in 1961 as 'modern gymnastics', later 'rhythmic sportive gymnastics', rhythmic gymnastics experienced its first World Championships for individual gymnasts in 1963 in Budapest. Today, Rhythmic gymnastics as a sport continues on, and hobbyists have adopted rhythmic gymnastics props such as the women's Ball, Clubs, Hoop, Ribbon, and Rope, plus the stick and rings of men's gymnastics, as exercise and recreational gear. These props have found their way into the modern 'juggling and dexterity play community' where they are used to perform tricks and maneuvers for fun fitness, and flexibility. Sticks and staves Devil sticks \\"Twirling\\", \\"sticking,\\" and \\"stick juggling\\" are all common terms for using the twirling prop known as devil sticks, flower sticks, or various other names. A set of devil sticks is made up of one baton and two control sticks. In use the central stick, the baton, is pushed, lifted and caressed by the two control sticks causing the stick to flip, wobble, spin, and fly through various maneuvers or tricks. Juggling sticks similar to the modern variants have continuously evolved as they were passed down through the centuries. Apparently originating in Africa earlier than 3000 BCE, \\"devil sticks\\" may have followed the Silk Road, from Cairo to China, and have been used in Europe since the Renaissance. Morris dancing In some forms of Morris dancing, a stick is twirled in one hand during a dance. For example, in stick dances from Brackley in the Cotswold tradition, each dancer twirls one or two sticks throughout the dance., p. 98 Staff twirling Staff twirling is the art or sport of skillfully manipulating a staff, such as a quarterstaff, bo, or other long length of wood, metal, or plastic as recreation, sport, or as a performance. In the martial art of bojutsu, a bo is used as a weapon, increasing the force delivered in a strike, through leverage. Bojitsu kata—detailed patterns of movements practiced to perfect one's form—are also used in many traditional Japanese arts, such as kabuki. Some of these kata, are very flowing and pleasant to experience, both as the one executing the movement, and as a spectator. Staff twirling has enjoyed recent growth in the dexterity play, juggling and fire dancing communities, in part due to the influence of martial arts, and in part due to increasing popularity of adult play as recreation. Mathematical significance The figure-eight twirl can be used as a demonstration that a double rotation is a loop in rotation space that can be shrunk to a point.

They mostly live in mountainous forest areas in small, female-dominated groups. They have a dark coat and can be distinguished by a characteristic white beard. Taxonomy L'Hoest's monkey is currently classified as a member of the genus Allochrocebus. Formerly, L'Hoest's monkey included the taxon preussi from the Gulf of Guinea region as a subspecies, but it is now considered a separate species, Preuss's monkey (A. preussi). L'Hoest's monkey was formerly included in the genus Cercopithecus. Molecular studies published by Anthony Tosi in 2003 had raised doubts about the classification of L'Hoest's monkey as a member of the genus Cercopithecus. The studies indicated that L'Hoest's monkey (along with the others in its species group) is more closely related to the vervet monkeys of the genus Chlorocebus and the patas monkey (genus Erythrocebus) than to the other guenons of the genus Cercopithecus. Physical characteristics C. lhoesti has a short, dark brown coat, with a chestnut color across the back and a dark belly. Its cheeks are light gray with a pale moustache. It has a characteristic and prominent white bib, In body length it is , with a tail. The male weighs about , while the smaller female weighs . Its tail is long and hook-shaped at the end. They are born fully coated and with their eyes open. Habitat and distribution L'Hoest's monkey occurs in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, and western Uganda. It is a forest monkey, which is typical of the moist and high primary forests. It will occupy a range of different kinds of forested areas, including gallery forest, mature lowland rain forests, wooded savanna at mountain slopes, and forest borders. However, it also will live on cultivated lands. In lowland forests it shows a preference toward areas where the forest is regenerating, while in mountain areas it will frequent the mature, tangled, undergrowth below the broken canopy. One study found this population only above but another found it as low as . Another mostly observed it from . Behavior C. lhoesti lives in fairly small groups dominated by females and have only a single male. The females are usually related, while the male stays only a couple of weeks or at most a couple of years. The adult male will make very loud and distinct calls. They are active during the day, mostly during early morning and late afternoon. They sleep in trees in a sitting position, usually either holding branches or each other. When they are alarmed or see they are being observed they will flee and take shelter in trees, and after become very still. They are mostly terrestrial. Reproduction L'Hoest's monkey breeds seasonally, with the timing depending on the area. After about a five-month gestation period, a single young will be born. The mother gives birth typically at night and where ever she happens to be at the time. Birth usually occurs at the end of the dry season, which allows lactation when rainfall is highest. She will eat the placenta and lick the baby clean while it hangs on to her belly. The other females in the group will show much interest in the newborn and will try to hold it. After a few months nursing becomes less frequent, but will continue for about two years when there is another birth. When male offspring reach sexual maturity they will leave the group. In captivity they have been known to live for more than 30 years. Diet In the wild L'Hoest's monkey is primarily a herbivore, which will mostly eat fruit, mushrooms, herbs, roots, and leaves. However, it will also occasionally eat eggs, lizards, and small birds.

Air brakes are used in large heavy vehicles, particularly those having multiple trailers which must be linked into the brake system, such as trucks, buses, trailers, and semi-trailers, in addition to their use in railroad trains. George Westinghouse first developed air brakes for use in railway service. He patented a safer air brake on March 5, 1872. Westinghouse made numerous alterations to improve his air pressured brake invention, which led to various forms of the automatic brake. In the early 20th century, after its advantages were proven in railway use, it was adopted by manufacturers of trucks and heavy road vehicles. Design and function Air brakes are typically used on heavy trucks and buses. The system consists of service brakes, parking brakes, a control pedal, and an air storage tank. For the parking brake, there is a disc or drum arrangement which is designed to be held in the 'applied' position by spring pressure. Air pressure must be produced to release these \\"spring brake\\" parking brakes. For the service brakes (the ones used while driving for slowing or stopping) to be applied, the brake pedal is pushed, routing the air under pressure (approx or 6.89–8.27 bar) to the brake chamber, causing the brake to be engaged. Most types of truck air brakes are drum brakes, though there is an increasing trend towards the use of disc brakes. The air compressor draws filtered air from the atmosphere and forces it into high-pressure reservoirs at around . Most heavy vehicles have a gauge within the driver's view, indicating the availability of air pressure for safe vehicle operation, often including warning tones or lights. A mechanical \\"wig wag\\" that automatically drops down into the driver's field of vision when the pressure drops below a certain point is also common. Setting of the parking/emergency brake releases the pressurized air in the lines between the compressed air storage tank and the brakes, thus allowing the spring actuated parking brake to engage. A sudden loss of air pressure would result in full spring brake pressure immediately. A compressed air brake system is divided into a supply system and a control system. The supply system compresses, stores and supplies high-pressure air to the control system as well as to additional air operated auxiliary truck systems (gearbox shift control, clutch pedal air assistance servo, etc.). Supply system Highly simplified air brake diagram on a commercial road vehicle (does not show all air reservoirs and all applicable air valves). The air compressor is driven by the engine either by crankshaft pulley via a belt or directly from the engine timing gears. It is lubricated and cooled by the engine lubrication and cooling systems. Compressed air is first routed through a cooling coil and into an air dryer which removes moisture and oil impurities and also may include a pressure regulator, safety valve and smaller purge reservoir. As an alternative to the air dryer, the supply system can be equipped with an anti- freeze device and oil separator. The compressed air is then stored in a supply reservoir (also called a wet tank) from which it is then distributed via a four-way protection valve into the primary reservoir (rear brake reservoir) and the secondary reservoir (front/trailer brake reservoir), a parking brake reservoir, and an auxiliary air supply distribution point. The system also includes various check, pressure limiting, drain and safety valves. Air brake systems may include a wig wag device which deploys to warn the driver if the system air pressure drops too low. Control system The control system is further divided into two service brake circuits, the parking brake circuit, and the trailer brake circuit. The dual service brake circuits are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety in case of an air leak. The service brakes are applied by means of a brake pedal air valve which regulates both circuits. The parking brake is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via a hand control valve. The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover park brake air tank via a park brake relay valve and the control line is regulated via the trailer brake relay valve. The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover brake pedal air valve, trailer service brake hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover park brake hand control.

Hydraulic brakes use a liquid (hydraulic fluid) to transfer pressure from the brake pedal to the brake shoe to stop the vehicle. Air brakes are used in heavy commercial vehicles due to their reliability. They have several advantages for large multi-trailer vehicles: *The supply of air is unlimited, so the brake system can never run out of its operating fluid, as hydraulic brakes can. Minor leaks do not result in brake failures. *Air line couplings are easier to attach and detach than hydraulic lines; the risk of air getting into hydraulic fluid is eliminated, as is the need to bleed brakes when they are serviced. Air brake circuits on trailers can be easily attached and removed. *Air not only serves as a fluid for transmission of force, but also stores potential energy as it is compressed, so it can serve to control the force applied; hydraulic fluid is nearly incompressible. Air brake systems include an air tank that stores sufficient energy to stop the vehicle if the compressor fails. *Air brakes are effective even with considerable leakage, so an air brake system can be designed with sufficient \\"fail-safe\\" capacity to stop the vehicle safely even when leaking. *The compressed air inherent in the system can be used for accessory applications that hydraulics are not appropriate for, such as air horns and seat adjusters. Disadvantages Although air brakes are not readily considered the superior braking system for heavy vehicles, generally those with a maximum gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 26,000 to 33,000 pounds or more, which would over load hydraulic brakes, they also have the following disadvantages, when compared to hydraulic braking systems: * Air brakes generally cost more. * Air brake systems compress air, which results in moisture that requires air dryers to remove, which also increases the price for air brake systems and can contribute to higher maintenance and repair costs, particularly in the first five years. * In the U.S. commercial drivers are required to obtain additional training and licensing, known as an “endorsement,” in order to legally drive any vehicle using an air brake system. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), which regulates the trucking industry in the U.S., requires that drivers who operate a vehicle equipped with air brakes take their driving test in one.https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/content/38395 * Learning to operate air brakes smoothly has a learning curve, as they are difficult to operate smoothly. * Also, since air brakes must be operated differently from hydraulic systems, driving a vehicle with air brakes requires knowledge of proper maintenance. A driver is required to inspect the air pressurization system prior to driving and make sure all tanks are in working order. * As noted by the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC), “Operating commercial vehicles or vehicles equipped with air brakes requires special knowledge and skill, and the cost of a mistake can be very high. When large vehicles are involved in crashes, the damage—to vehicles, cargo and human lives—can be catastrophic.” Driving Commercial Vehicles: A Guide for Professional Drivers; page 1; ICBC; 2016; accessed 27 March 2019.

There are two stations on the site, the older thermal station containing units 1, 2, and 3 and the combined cycle gas station containing units CG14, CG15 and ST16, which is located toward the eastern end of the site. The six units have a total installed capacity of 1020 MW. The plant is located on the Poolbeg peninsula in Ringsend, Dublin, on the south bank of Dublin Port. Its two chimneys, at just over 207 metres, are visible over much of Dublin, particularly Sandymount Strand, making them well-known landmarks and some of the tallest structures in Ireland. History Old Pigeon House Hotel and Generating Station Poolbeg Thermal Station (from the west side) in 2006 Poolbeg is situated adjacent to the now-decommissioned Pigeon House generating station, where electricity was first generated in 1903 also with the distinction of being the first in the world to generate three phase power. The Pigeon House was previously a military barracks and hotel and the officers accommodation building was acquired by Dublin corporation in 1897. It was used for power generation until it was decommissioned in 1976, and the Poolbeg plant is still known locally as the Pigeon House. The modern Poolbeg station was constructed in two separate phases, beginning in the 1960s. The ESB decided to construct the station in 1965 and the initial development was completed in 1971 with the construction of Units 1 and 2 at a cost of 20 million Irish pounds. The original Pigeon House generators remained on standby duty until 1976. Unit 3 was completed in 1978 at a cost of 40 million pounds. The combined cycle station was constructed in the 1990s. CG14 was commissioned in 1994, CG15 in 1998 and ST16 in 2001. Technical details The identical units 1 and 2 have a design output of 120 MW each. They both have turbo- alternators manufactured by Brown Boveri and 'drum type' boilers by Fives Penhoet, France. Unit 3 has a design output of 271 MW. It uses a turbo- alternator manufactured by Alstom, France and a 'once through' type Boiler by M.A.N Germany. Uniquely among power stations run by the Electricity Supply Board, all three units in the thermal plant can currently fire on oil or gas. Gas is supplied to the site by the Bord Gáis network. Oil is stored in five tank in the site's oil farm, with a maximum capacity of 140,000 tonnes. The CCGT plant has two Siemens V94.2A gas turbines (units CG14 and CG15), a HRSG and a steam turbine (ST16). When it opens in 2017, the adjacent Dublin Waste- to-Energy facility will supply the power plant with steam. Partial closure In 2006, the ESB advised of its intention to withdraw approximately 1,300 MW of total Irish electricity capacity over the next five years. This effectively reduced the installed capacity of fully dispatchable electricity generation in the country from 6,437 MW to 5,150 MW by the end of 2010. This 1300 MW closure, was aimed at the older inefficient power stations in Ireland, the 60% average generation availability between 2002 and 2005 that was produced by the 3 thermal units, units which amount to 461 MW of combined electricity capacity at Poolbeg Generating Station Dublin were to close, while the newer 460 MW combined cycle fossil gas turbine at Poolbeg would remain operational.http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_1010398.shtml Poolbeg Thermal (461MW) (Dublin) (Oil / Gas).

The Nayak Kings were of Telugu origin who practiced Shaivite Hinduism and were patrons of Theravada Buddhism. The Nayak rulers played a huge role in reviving Buddhism in the island. They spoke Tamil, which was also used as the court language in Kandy alongside Sinhalese. The King was eventually deposed by the British under the terms of the Kandyan Convention, in 1815, ending over 2300 years of Sinhalese monarchy on the island. The island was incorporated into the British Empire, and Sri Vikrama Rajasinha was succeeded by George III, as monarch of British Ceylon.  Early life  Prior to his coronation in 1798, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha was known as Prince Kannasamy Naidu. He was a member of the Madurai Nayak Dynasty and the nephew of Sri Rajadhi Rajasinha. He succeed his uncle as the King of Kandy in 1798 at the age of eighteen.  Reign  The Throne of Kandyan Kings.  Early reign  There was a rival claimant to succeed Sri Rajadhi Rajasinha, the brother of Queen Upendrama, who had a stronger claim. However, Pilimatalauwa, the first Adigar (Prime Minister) chose Prince Kannasamy, reportedly with deep seated plans to usurp the throne to set up a dynasty of his own. Sri Vikrama Rajasinha was faced with numerous conspiracies to overthrow him and reigned through one of the most turbulent periods in Sri Lanka's history.  Internal Conflict  Capture of HM Rajasinha in 1815. During his time, the British who had succeeded the Dutch in the Maritime Provinces had not interfered in the politics of the Kandy. But Pilimatalauwa, the first Adigar of the King, started covert operations with the British to provoke the King into acts of aggression, which would give the British an excuse to seize the Kingdom. The Adigar manipulated the King into beginning a military conflict with the British, who had gained a strong position in the coastal provinces. War was declared and on March 22, 1803 the British entered Kandy with no resistance, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha having fled. The adigar massacred the British garrison in Kandy in June and restored the King to the throne. Pilimitalava plotted to overthrow the King and seize the crown for himself, but his plot was discovered, and, having been pardoned on two previous occasions, he was executed. The disgraced adigar was replaced by his nephew, Ehelepola Nilame, who soon came under suspicion of following his uncle in plotting the overthrow of Sri Vikrama Rajasinha. A rebellion instigated by Ehalepola was suppressed, after which he then fled to Colombo and joined the British. After failing to surrender (after 3 weeks of notice), the exasperated King dismissed Ehelepola, confiscated his lands, and ordered the imprisonment and execution of his wife and children. A propagandised account of the execution was widely circulated by sympathisers. Rangammal Devi, Queen Consort. Drawn by William Daniell in 1800s. Ehelepola fled to British-controlled territory, where he persuaded the British that Sri Vikrama Rajasinha's tyranny deserved a military intervention. The pretext was provided by the seizure of a number of British merchants, who were detained on suspicion of spying and were tortured, killing several of them. An invasion was duly mounted and advanced to Kandy without resistance, reaching the city on February 10, 1815. On March 2, the Kingdom was ceded to the British under a treaty called the Kandyan Convention. Regarding the King's reign, the historian Louis Edmund Blaze states that \\"He was not as ardent a patriot as his immediate successors; nor did he show those mental and moral qualities which enabled former Kings to hold their own against rebellion and invasion. To say he was cruel does not mean much, for cruel Kings and nobles were not rare in those days; and it is questionable whether all the cruel deeds attributed to Sri Vickrema Rajasinghe were of his own devising or done by his authority. It might be more fair to regard him as a weak tool in the hands of designing chiefs than as the monster of cruelty, which it is an idle fashion with some writers to call him. He did a lot to beautify his capital. The lake and the Octagon in Kandy have always been considered the work of the King.\\"  Death  On March 2, 1815 the Kingdom was ceded to the British and Sri Vikrama Rajasinha was deposed and taken as a royal prisoner by the British to Vellore Fort in southern India. He lived on a small allowance given to him with his two queens by the British Government. He died of dropsy on January 30, 1832, aged 52 years. His death anniversary is celebrated as Guru Pooja by his direct descendant Mr. V. Ashok Raja and Family at Muthu Mandabam, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India. Since 2011, Guru pooja is celebrated at Muthu Mandabam by his family members.

Flag of the Kingdom of Kandy. The current Flag of Sri Lanka incorporates Sri Vikrama Rajasinha's Royal Standard. In September 1945 it was proposed in an address to the State Council that the flag be adopted as Sri Lanka's national flag: > \\"This House is of opinion that the Royal Standard of King Sri Vikrama > Rajasinha depicting a yellow lion passant holding a sword in its right paw > on a red background, which was removed to England after the Convention of > 1815, should once again be adopted as the official flag of Free Lanka.\\" Kandy Lake, an artificial lake overlooking the palace in Kandy was commissioned by Sri Vikrama Rajasinha. The Paththirippuwa or Octagon of the Sri Dalada Maligawa, is widely regarded as the epitome or the most admired symbol and representation of Kandyan Sinhalese Architecture. It was built in 1802 A.D. by Devendra Mulachari, Master Craftsman and Royal Architect, on the instructions of King Sri Vikrama Rajasinha. During Sri Vikrama Rajasinha's time as a royal prisoner in Vellore Fort he received a privy purse, which his descendants continued to receive from the Government of Ceylon until 1965. Muthu Mandapam is a memorial built around the tombstone of Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, the last south Indian origin ruler of Kandy. Situated on the bank Palar River, it is just one km north of Vellore town. During Sri Vikrama Rajasinha's reign, Tamil was used as one of the court languages in Kandy - a historical fact with implications for the present-day politics of Sri Lanka. In 2018, a Sinhala film titled Girivassipura was made and released which depicts the real life story of the King Sri Vikrama Rajasinha.

He was elected sheriff of Wayne County, Michigan, and served a four-year term. He also served three times as a delegate from Michigan to the Democratic National Convention, in 1908, 1912, and 1916. He was also the first owner of the Detroit Tigers in Major League Baseball, owning the club during the inaugural 1901 season. Burns was born in 1865 at Springwells, Michigan, a district that was later incorporated into the City of Detroit. He was the sixth of eight children born to Peter and Hanorah (O'Callaghan) Burns. His father operated a brickworks that supplied bricks to construct many of the important buildings in Detroit. After being educated in the public schools of Springwells and Detroit, he joined his brothers and father in the brickworks business. After his father died, he continued to operate the brickworks with his brothers. As a teenager, Burns was a boxer and wrestler and won the state amateur championship as a middleweight in both events. He did not compete professionally, but he played an influential role in the careers of Tommy Ryan (welterweight champion, 1884–98; middleweight champion, 1898–1906) and Noah Brusso (heavyweight champion, 1906–08). Brusso fought under the name \\"Tommy Burns\\" in honor of his friend and sponsor. Burns was married in 1894 to Katherine Walsh. They had two sons, James Anthony born 1899, and Francis Leo born 1905. James Anthony served in the Michigan Senate and on the Wayne County Board of Commissioners. Francis Leo became a priest and helped found Detroit Catholic Central High School. In March 1900, Burns purchased the Detroit Tigers in conjunction with George Stallings for $12,000. He led the team to major league status in 1901 as an inaugural member of the American League and served as the team's president. The team played its home games at Bennett Park except on Sundays, when Detroit's blue laws forbade the team from playing there; Burns Park in Springwells served as the Tigers' Sunday home ball park. The 1901 Tigers had a 74-61 win-loss record. Burns sold his interest in the team to Samuel F. Angus in 1902 for $20,000. In April 1905, Burns was elected as the sheriff of Wayne County, Michigan. He was re-elected in November 1906. He was also a member of the Democratic Party and served as a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1908, 1912 and 1916. After his term as sheriff expired, Burns went into the hotel business, constructing the Burns Hotel on Cadillac Square in 1905. (The hotel was torn down in 1927.) He subsequently sold his interest in the Burns Hotel and purchased the Ste. Claire Hotel, a 140-room hotel that was the first \\"fireproof\\" hotel in downtown Detroit. He also started the \\"Burns and Campbell\\" bar on Michigan Avenue in Detroit and later owned the \\"Metropole Restaurant and Grill\\" on Griswold Street. Burns was a member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks and Loyal Order of Moose. He died in 1928 at Grace Hospital, Detroit. Burns died in January 1928 at age 62 at Grace Hospital in Detroit.

He was later known as a leading media personality, covering aspects of the recovery of the city from the devastation following Hurricane Katrina. Before his arrest for the murder of his third wife, he served as an in-house television host and analyst at the Fair Grounds Race Course from 1990 until 2005. Marinello died in custody at Dixon Correctional Institute on February 21, 2020 of natural causes. Mary Elizabeth Marinello murder case On August 31, 2006, Marinello's estranged wife, Mary Elizabeth, was shot twice in the face in the parking lot of an office tower in Metairie, Louisiana. Jefferson Parish Sheriff's authorities initially announced their belief that the murder was a result of a botched robbery. Marinello voluntarily met with sheriff's investigators and initially denied any connection to the murder of his estranged wife, saying he was in Jackson, Mississippi. On September 7, he voluntarily turned himself in to the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Department's main office in Gretna, Louisiana. He was subsequently arrested and charged with second-degree murder in the killing of his wife, who filed for a contentious divorce after she discovered he was not legally divorced when they wed. On the night of September 11, 2006, Marinello posted a $250,000 bond and was released from jail. Detectives believed that Marinello himself committed the crime by staking out the Metairie office tower where Mary Elizabeth regularly saw a counselor, allegedly donning a false beard and mustache and shooting her twice in the face with a .38 caliber pistol. Surveillance video around the scene of the crime recorded a figure matching the description of a suspicious person seen leaving the scene on a bicycle. The surveillance video showed a 15-minute sequence of images of a man fitting the description of the disguised Marinello pacing back and forth in the parking lot. The suspicious person was described as a scruffy-looking white male with a beard and a dark complexion and was reportedly seen loading a bicycle into a white Taurus matching the description of a vehicle seen leaving the crime scene; a white Taurus was later found outside Marinello's residence. The key piece of evidence leading to charges was a sheet of paper with notes and a diagram found in Marinello's FEMA trailer during the execution of a search warrant several days after the crime. This was characterized as a checklist or to-do list for the murder and its aftermath, and contained written notes about a gun and its disposal, a bike and a disguise. It was determined that Marinello recently purchased a disguise and had purchased bullets for a .38 caliber gun. The nylon-coated bullets purchased by Marinello were unusual and were of the same kind as those found in Mary Elizabeth's body. Marinello's alibi that he was in Jackson, Mississippi at 6:30 p.m., watching the football game with friends, was undermined when the acquaintances said he actually did not show up until after kickoff at 7:30. This allowed for the possibility that Marinello was in Old Metairie at the time of his wife's murder, around 4:00 p.m. Marinello's attorneys sought and received a change of venue for the trial claiming that Marinello would not be able to receive a fair trial at home due to the publicity surrounding the case. The trial was then moved from Jefferson Parish, Louisiana to Lafayette Parish, Louisiana. After two weeks in court, and after testifying himself in an effort to explain his actions and some of the evidence in the case (such as the handwritten \\"to do list\\" found in his abode after the murder), on December 13, 2008, the jury found Marinello guilty of second degree murder after 90 minutes of deliberation. In Louisiana, a conviction for this charge carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole. Marinello subsequently appealed his conviction. It was upheld by the Louisiana Third Circuit Court of Appeals, and the Louisiana Supreme Court declined to hear his appeal.

Life and career Christened David William Thomas, he was born at Nantmoch Uchaf farm in Penderyn, a village near Hirwaun, the son of a shepherd named Philip Thomas and his wife Elizabeth. The following year, the family moved to Llanfabon, near Cilfynydd, where he attended the local school until the age of 12. For the next two years he worked at a local grocer's shop, then at the age of 14 he went down the pit at the Albion Colliery, Cilfynydd, where one of Britain's worst mining disasters had occurred in 1894. He continued to work there until the age of 25, even after beginning lessons with a local music teacher and organist, Tom Llewellyn Jenkins, himself a minor composer. In 1925 he was awarded a Glamorgan Scholarship to University College, Cardiff, entering directly into the third year of music studies, becoming a pupil of Professor David Evans and John Morgan Lloyd; he obtained a B.Mus. degree in 1928. From there he proceeded to the University of Bristol, where he spent a year in teacher training. In 1929 he was appointed Head of Music at Lewis School Pengam, a grammar school for boys, becoming the first full-time secondary school music teacher in Wales. His students at Pengam included composers Robert Smith and Mervyn Burtch. In 1933, he married Eirwen Evans and they settled in Maesycwmmer. In 1938 the University of Wales awarded him a D.Mus. In 1944 he was awarded the Clements Memorial Prize for his First String Quartet, and this effectively launched his career as a leading composer; thereafter he received regular commissions. At the same time, he began using the name David Wynne for professional purposes. He retired from school teaching in 1960. From 1961 to 1971 he taught composition at Cardiff College of Music and Drama (now the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama),Music web and from 1970 to 1979 in the Department of Music at Cardiff University. In 1983, he died suddenly at his home in Pencoed, whilst working on his Fourth Symphony. Compositions Wynne's first symphony, written in 1952, was never performed. His second, in 1956, was only the second work ever commissioned by the Welsh Music Guild. One of his best- known orchestral works, the Third Symphony, was written in 1963 for the Caerffili Festival, and inspired by Caerphilly Castle, its structure based on the castle's concentric design; it was premièred by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Sir Michael Tippett. His gentler and more lyrical side emerged in his Fantasia for Piano and Orchestra, which Martin Jones premiered with the Cardiff University Orchestra in 1972. The Welsh language had an influence on his composition that was both subtle and profound. The speech rhythms of Welsh poetry permeate his instrumental music, its melodic inflections often consciously influenced by the hwyl of the Welsh preachers that he heard in his youth. Many of his vocal works are settings of early and mediaeval Welsh poetry for which he seems to have had an especial affinity. In Owain ab Urien, a cantata for male voice choir with brass and percussion, he set some of the earliest Welsh poetry, written in the 6th century. This work was also commissioned by the Welsh Music Guild, whose president at the time was Sir Michael Tippett, in memory of its founder, John Edwards; and first performed at the Festival Hall in London in 1967 by the Pendyrus Male Voice Choir under its late director Glynne Jones and the Philip Jones brass ensemble.

History Mulberry's then-only public school began high school classes in 1907. In 1914, a separate high school was constructed; it was a two-story brick building with six classrooms and an auditorium, costing approximately $12,500. In 1921, the first edition of the MHS yearbook was published, titled The Mulberry Tree in honor of the city's famed mulberry tree. In 1922, land was donated for the construction of a new high school, on the east side of what is now Northeast First Avenue; construction was completed in 1924. Also in 1924, MHS began inter-school football play. During the Great Depression, many schools cut their terms or lost their accreditation, and the state of Florida ran out of money, but MHS was able to stay open thanks to taxes paid by area phosphate firms. In 1955, the current school was constructed on of land given by Virginia-Carolina Chemical Corporation and International Minerals and Chemical Corporation; the old high school was converted to an elementary school, Purcell.

History  The Start-1 launch vehicle derives its name from the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I) between the United States and the Soviet Union. The START I treaty called for both sides to limit their nuclear arsenals to 6,000 nuclear warheads atop a total of 1,600 ICBMs, SLBMs, and bombers. This led to a lot of surplus ICBMs on both sides, including the Soviet Topol. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia took over responsibility for executing the treaty. The Russian government decided to dispose of some of their ICBMs by using them as launch vehicles, which was an allowed method of disposal under the treaty. Modification of the ICBMs into launch vehicles was carried out by the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology (MITT), which also designed the Topol missile. On March 25, 1993 (13:15 UTC), the first Start-1 rocket was launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome with a non- commercial payload. The first commercial launch was conducted almost four years later on March 4, 1997 from Svobodny Cosmodrome with a Russian payload. Since that time all flights of the Start-1 have been conducted from Svobodny. Currently, the Russian company United Start Launch manages the Start-1 program. The most notable flight of the Start-1 was conducted on April 25, 2006 with the launch of the Israeli EROS B Earth observation satellite. The launch received more coverage than usual because of the tensions between Israel and Iran at the time. While the Eros B satellite is commercial, its primary customer is the Israeli government, which could use it to spy on Iranian military and nuclear facilities. After EROS B launch the project ended due to small size of small satellite market and loss of business to other small launchers. Around 2016 thanks to the increase of the small satellite market and approaching end of life of Topol missiles MITT and RVSN management started to float the idea of resuming launches. In late 2018 MITT secured funding for the resumption. MITT plans to start launching again in early 2022.  Description  Diagram of the Start-1 rocket. The Start-1 launch vehicle is derived from the RT-2PM Topol ICBM. The first three stages of the Topol missile are used as the first three stages of the Start-1 rocket and are essentially unmodified for their new purpose. A fourth stage, specially developed by the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology, and the payload shroud take the place of the nuclear warhead and are the main differences between the Topol ICBM and the Start-1 rocket. Additionally, a Post-Boost Propulsion System (PBPS) may be added between the fourth stage and the payload to circularize the orbit of the payload if necessary. The PBPS provides propulsion using a solid-propellant nitrogen gas generator. The gas goes through three pairs of nozzles that can swivel to maneuver the payload. The Start-1 rocket is unique amongst launch vehicles in that its launch platform is mobile, allowing for the Start-1 to potentially launch from anywhere. The Start-1 launches from an unmodified Topol Transporter-Erector-Launcher (TEL). The TEL is a massive fourteen-wheeled vehicle, six of which pivot for steering. The launch vehicle is transported and launched inside a mobile Transport and Launch Carrier (TLC) carried by the TEL. The TLC consists of an air-tight composite cylinder that protects the launch vehicle and payload from variations in temperature and humidity. The TLC lies in the middle of the TEL lengthwise and bisects the driver's cab in two. A Start-1 TEL moving towards the launch pad Before launch, the TEL is moved to the launch pad where it deploys four stabilizing jacks which lift the whole vehicle off the ground. Approximately 90 seconds before the launch, the TLC ejects the protective front nose cone, exposing the rocket so that it can launch. The TLC then is raised to a vertical position. During the launch sequence, the TEL uses compressed gas to force the rocket out of the TLC. Once the rocket reaches a height of approximately 30 meters (the height of the top of the TLC in the vertical position), the first stage ignites. The time from first-stage ignition to spacecraft separation is approximately 15 minutes.  Variants  Diagram of the Start rocket. A version of the Start-1 rocket, simply called Start, was developed in parallel with the Start-1 program. Start differed from Start-1 by using the second stage of the Start-1 twice, giving it a total of five stages. With the extra stage, payload to LEO was increased to 850 kg. The first (and, so far, only) launch of the Start rocket occurred on 28 March 1995 from LC158 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. The Start rocket carried Gurwin, an Israeli technology satellite; EKA, a Russian dummy test satellite; and Oscar 29, an amateur radio satellite built by the Autonomous University of Mexico. The rocket, however, failed not too long after liftoff, dumping debris and its payload into the Sea of Okhotsk. Little information has come forth from the Russian government as to what caused the rocket to fail, or even whether or not the Start program has been canceled.  Launch history  {  ----- FFDEAD;\\" !

Location in the Czech Republic During May 25/May 26, 1872 heavy rain flooded the Mladotický creek. During night of May 27/May 28 the Permo- Carboniferous layers on west slope of the hill slipped and blocked the stream. The flooding was not the only reason of the landslide - structure of the hillside resulted in constant slow shift down, sandstone quarries used for centuries had lowered stability of the slope and the recently built railway Plzeň – Žatec cut yet another dent to the hill. The landslide destroyed the railroad which got later rebuilt on the opposite side of the valley. Levee of large Mladotický pond (Mladotický rybník, few kilometers downstream, 90 hectares) was broken by the flooded stream; the pond was never rebuilt. The lake has area of 4.5 hectares, length around 500 m and its width varies between 70–100 m. Its surface is 413 m above sea level. Depth was 7.7 m in 1972 and only 6.7 m in 1999 - the lake is slowly clogging up and without human intervention it would disappear within decades.

Background Rockwell was born in Newport, Tennessee on September 20, 1892, the son of Baptist minister James Chester Rockwell and his wife Loula Ayres. After James Rockwell's death from typhoid fever at the age of twenty-six, the family moved several times, eventually settling in Asheville, North Carolina.About Kiffin Rockwell. Virginia Military Institute Archives Online Historical Research Center. Retrieved: 2009-10-14. Kiffin's paternal and maternal grandfathers fought in the American Civil War, and he grew up listening to stories about battles and marches. They also taught the young boy fishing, hunting and horse riding.Rockwell, Kiffin Yates, and Paul Ayres Rockwell. War Letters of Kiffin Yates Rockwell, Foreign Legionnaire and Aviator, France, 1914-1916. Garden City, N.Y.: The Country Life Press, 1925. From 1906 to 1908, Rockwell attended the Asheville High School, and in the fall of 1908 enrolled in Virginia Military Institute. In the fall of 1909, Rockwell left for the United States Naval Academy, but after taking preliminary courses decided to join his brother Paul at Washington and Lee University, in Lexington, Virginia, where currently there is a plaque in Lee Chapel in Kiffin Rockwell's memory. In 1912, Rockwell took a break from his studies deciding to see the world. He traveled first to the Pacific Coast and Western Canada, and then stayed in San Francisco, where he opened an advertising agency, which at one time, according to his brother Paul, employed twenty people (Kiffin was nineteen at that time). In 1913, Rockwell returned to Asheville before joining Paul Rockwell in Atlanta, finding employment with Massengale Advertising Agency. In the Western Front At the outbreak of World War I, on August 3, 1914, Kiffin Rockwell offered his services to France by letter, which he wrote with his brother Paul, to the French Consul-General in New Orleans.

Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1920. suggested that Kiffin Yates Rockwell was the first American who saw military service with France during the beginning of World War I. Without waiting for a reply, the Rockwell brothers boarded SS St Paul, American Line in New York City and on August 7, 1914 departed for Europe, where they enlisted in the French Foreign Legion. Kiffin Rockwell was shot through the leg on May 9, 1915 when his unit, the 1st Foreign Legion Regiment charged La Targette, north of Arras. He spent six weeks in the hospital and when he left for Paris on convalescent leave, his leg was completely healed. While in Paris, he spent time with his brother, Paul, who was severely wounded in the winter of 1914–15 in the shoulder, earlier than Kiffin, and became unfit for active service. After recuperating, Paul was transferred to the Allied Press Mission of French Army Grand Headquarters and worked as a war correspondent with the Chicago Daily News.Rockwell, Kiffin Yates. NCpedia.

Background Thayer was born in Blackstone, Massachusetts, on July 7, 1857. He attended Worcester Academy and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1880 where he captained the baseball and football teams. He learned law through an apprenticeship rather than by attending law school and was admitted to the bar in 1882. He enjoyed a modest career in local politics, first as a Democrat and later as a Republican. He was appointed a judge of the Superior Court of Massachusetts in Dedham in 1917.New York Times: \\"Judge Thayer Dies in Boston at 75\\", New York Times, April 19, 1933. Accessed December 20, 2009 In 1920, Thayer gave a speech to new American citizens decrying Bolshevism and anarchism's threat to American institutions. He supported the suppression of radical speech and rebuked a jury that failed to return a conviction because they believed that an overt act was required rather than speech alone.Bruce Watson, Sacco and Vanzetti: The Men, the Murders, and the Judgment of Mankind (NY: Viking Press, 2007), 116–8; Herbert B.

Both Sacco and Vanzetti were Galleanists, adherents of Luigi Galleani and his particular brand of violent anarchism.Avrich, Paul, Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background, Princeton University Press, (1991), pp. 58–60, 97 A friend of Sacco and Vanzetti, Mario Buda, is believed to have been responsible for the Wall Street Bombing on September 16, 1920, in which 38 people were killed in response to the indictment of the two men. Thayer presided at the jury trial of Sacco and Vanzetti, at the end of which both men were found guilty and sentenced to death. Thayer denied all post-trial motions for a new trial, an act for which he was condemned by various left-wing and civil liberties groups and prominent legal scholars, including Felix Frankfurter. Thayer's behavior both on and off the bench during the trial drew criticism. A Boston Globe reporter, Frank Sibley, who had covered the trial, wrote a letter of protest to the Massachusetts attorney general condemning Thayer's bias. Others noted the frequency with which Thayer denied defense motions and the way he addressed defense attorney Fred H. Moore. Thayer defended his rulings to reporters saying, \\"No long-haired anarchist from California can run this court!\\" According to onlookers who later swore affidavits, in private discussion Thayer called Sacco and Vanzetti \\"Bolsheviki!\\" and said he would \\"get them good and proper\\". In 1924, referring to his denial of motions for a new trial, Thayer confronted a Massachusetts lawyer: \\"Did you see what I did with those anarchistic bastards the other day?\\" the judge said. \\"I guess that will hold them for a while! Let them go and see now what they can get out of the Supreme Court!\\" The outburst remained a secret until 1927 when its release fueled the arguments of Sacco and Vanzetti's defenders. The New York World attacked Thayer as \\"an agitated little man looking for publicity and utterly impervious to the ethical standards one has the right to expect of a man presiding in a capital case.\\" In 1927, as the scheduled executions approached, Massachusetts governor Alvan T. Fuller appointed a three-man panel to advise him as he considered clemency. It consisted of the popular novelist and Probate Judge Robert Grant, Harvard University President Abbott Lowell, and MIT President Samuel Wesley Stratton. While they determined that the trial had been fair and a new trial was not warranted, they assessed the charges against Thayer as well. They found some of the charges about his statements unbelievable or exaggerated, and they determined that anything he might have said had no impact on the trial. The panel's reading of the trial transcript convinced them that Thayer \\"tried to be scrupulously fair.\\"New York Times: \\"Advisers Hold Guilt Shown,\\" Aug. 7, 1927, accessed Dec. 20, 2009 Jurors in the Sacco-Vanzetti trial, the panel noted, were almost unanimous in praising Thayer for his conduct of the trial. Still the panel criticized him, using words provided by Judge Grant:Robert Grant, Fourscore: An Autobiography (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1934), 372 \\"He ought not to have talked about the case off the bench, and doing so was a grave breach of judicial decorum.\\" Sacco and Vanzetti both denounced Thayer. Vanzetti wrote, \\"I will try to see Thayer death (sic) before his pronunciation of our sentence\\" and asked fellow anarchists for \\"revenge, revenge in our names and the names of our living and dead.\\"Watson, Bruce, Sacco and Vanzetti: The Men, the Murders, and the Judgment of Mankind, Viking Press (2007), , , 264 Afterwards Fellow Galleanists retaliated violently over the next several years in revenge, placing bombs at the residences of trial participants, including a juror who had served in the Dedham trial, a prosecution witness, the official executioner, Robert G. Elliott, and Judge Thayer. On September 27, 1932, a dynamite-filled package bomb destroyed Thayer's home in Worcester, Massachusetts.

In Hebrew, tachrichim means to \\"enwrap\\" or \\"bind\\". It comes from the Biblical verse () \\"And Mordechai left the king's presence in royal apparel of blue and white and a huge golden crown and a wrap of linen (tachrich butz) and purple, and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was happy\\". History The traditional clothing for burying the dead are tachrichim, simple white garments or furnishings, including a winding sheet (sovev). Their use dates back to Rabbi Simeon ben Gamliel II, who, in the second century CE, asked to be buried in inexpensive linen garments. According to the Talmud, Rabban Gamliel observed that the custom of dressing the deceased in expensive clothing put such a terrible burden on the relatives of the deceased, that they would \\"abandon the body and run.\\"[1] The custom he initiated - which set both a decorous minimum and a limit on ostentation - has been followed by observant Jews ever since. \\"Whoever heaps elaborate shrouds upon the dead transgresses the injunction against wanton destruction. Such a one disgraces the deceased.\\"[2] The universal use of shrouds protected the poor from embarrassment at not being able to afford lavish burial clothes. Since shrouds have no pockets, wealth or status cannot be expressed or acknowledged in death. In every generation, these garments reaffirmed a fundamental belief in human equality. Tachrichim are white and entirely hand stitched, without tying knots. They are made without buttons, zippers, or fasteners. Tahrihim come in muslin or linen, fabrics that recall the garments of the ancient Hebrew priesthood. There is little difference in appearance or cost between them; the funeral home may or may not offer a choice. Tahrihim come packaged in sets for men and women. Regardless of gender, they include a tunic, pants, hood, and belt. The belt is tied to form the shape of the Hebrew letter shin, which stands for Shaddai, one of the accepted representations of God's ineffable Name. If the pants are not closed at the bottom to cover the feet, \\"booties\\" are additionally provided. The face is generally covered with a sudarium, much as in traditional artistic representations of Lazarus or Jesus in His tomb. Men may also be wrapped in a kittel, a simple, white ceremonial robe that some Jews wear on Yom Kippur, at the Passover seder, and under the wedding canopy. In earlier times, the sisterhoods or women's auxiliaries would make shrouds for their community; this practice may still occur in traditional communities. If the body has been prepared for burial with ritual cleansing (taharah), the body will automatically be dressed in tahrihim. Jewish funeral homes and burial societies (chevra kadishim) in general have a supply on hand, and the cost may be covered by their honorarium. In addition to tachrichim, some Jewish men are wrapped in the prayer shawl (tallit) in which they prayed. In this case, before the tallit is placed on a body for burial, one of its sets of fringes (tzitzit) is cut to demonstrate that the person is no longer bound by the religious obligations of the living. Tahrihim swaddle the entire body, including the face, so that the deceased is both clothed and protected against the gaze of other people.

Gartner estimates that poor quality data causes failure in up to 50% of customer relationship management systems. Older technology required the tight integration of data quality software, whereas this can now be accomplished by loosely coupling technology in a service-oriented architecture.  Features and functionality  A data quality firewall guarantees database accuracy and consistency. This application ensures that only valid and high quality data enter the system, which means that it obliquely protects the database from damage; this is extremely important since database integrity and security are absolutely essential. A data quality firewall provides real time feedback information about the quality of the data submitted to the system. The main goal of a data quality process consists in capturing erroneous and invalid data, processing them and eliminating duplicates and, lastly, exporting valid data to the user without failing to store a back-up copy into the database. A data quality firewall acts similarly to a network security firewall. It enables packets to pass through specified ports by filtering out data that present quality issues and allowing the remaining, valid data to be stored in the database. In other words, the firewall sits between the data source and the database and works throughout the extraction, processing and loading of data. It is necessary that data streams be subject to accurate validity checks before they can be considered as being correct or trustworthy. Such checks are of a temporal, formal, logic and forecasting kind.

Birth and family Linus was born on a farm near Vienna, Oneida County, New York. He married Sarah E.F. Sale in 1853. She died of yellow fever September 13, 1855. Her tombstone still stands in Lewisberg, Louisiana. After five years Linus married a second time, to Ellen K. Burruss. They had three sons, one of whom later became Dean of the Candler School of Theology, Franklin N. Parker. Young manhood and military service Linus worked for an older brother in a store in New Orleans in 1845. During this time, he studied Latin and Greek before daylight in the morning and after his return from business in the evening. In 1846 he served as a soldier in the Mexican–American War. After that he began the study of law, but was convinced to enter the Methodist ministry. Ordained ministry During March 1849 Linus served as a Supply Pastor for the church on Algiers Street. He was Licensed to Preach in May of that year. He joined the Louisiana Annual Conference, becoming an ordained Elder in 1853. Rev. Parker served the following appointments, all in Louisiana: Lake Providence (1849), Shreveport (1850–51), Felicity Street, New Orleans (1852–54), Carondelet Street, New Orleans (1855–57), Presiding Elder of the New Orleans District (1858), Felicity Street again (1859–61), Shreveport again (1862–63), the Caldo Circuit (1864–65), and Felicity Street a third time (1866–69).

Blek was written and illustrated by Giovanni Sinchetto, Dario Guzzon and Pietro Sartoris, also known as trio EsseGesse. Fictional character Blek is the leader of a group of trappers during the American Revolutionary War, who fight against the cruel Redcoats, the symbol of British colonialist oppression. Blek's best friends and allies are his stepson Roddy Lassiter and Professor Cornelius Occultis. Although not present in every episode, lawyer Connoly, the leader of American revolutionaries in Boston, is another prominent character. Benjamin Franklin also made occasional appearances. Publication history Italy The prototype of the character was published in another comic called Il Piccolo Trapper in 1953, inspired by the works of Fenimore Cooper and Zane Grey. The blonde giant appeared a year later. From 1954 to 1967, 654 strips were published in the Collana Araldo series. In its heyday, the strip boasted a weekly circulation of 400,000. However, the authors moved on to create Comandante Mark after a financial disagreement with the original publisher in 1965. In addition to Italy, Blek was reprinted in other countries such as Greece (as ΜΠΛΕΚ), Turkey (as Teksas, Çelik Blek), France (as Blek le Roc), and former Yugoslavia (as Veliki Blek). The Slovenian national minority in Italy was introduced to Blek in Slovenian language in 1959 (as Silni Tom, meaning Tough Tom); Slovenian translation was changed to Veliki Blek in 1990s. In Scandinavia he was called Davy Crockett, although he has nothing to do with the historical figure. France Carlo Cedroni, Nicola Del Principe and many others continued the production for Éditions Lug, while the list of French authors included Jean-Yves Mitton and André Amouriq. The title peaked at 300,000 copies. Blek also received a revamped origin; writer Marcel Navarro revealed \\"Blek\\" means \\"Golden Hair\\" in the language of Native Americans, but that he was born Yannick Leroc in Saint-Malo, France on November 27, 1749. Yugoslavia In former Yugoslavia, Blek was published in the Lunov magnus strip and Strip zabavnik series. The character reached the print run of 100,000, so in 1978 the local publisher (Dnevnik from Novi Sad) decided to produce its own licensed material, colloquially known as YU Blek. The writers were Petar Aladžić, Predrag Ivanović, Miodrag Milanović, Ivica Mitrović and Svetozar Obradović. The list of artists included Stevan Brajdić, Milorad Žarić, Miodrag Ivanović, Predrag Ivanović, D. Ivković, Branislav Kerac, Bojan Kerzan, Pavel Koza, Vladimir Krstić, Spasoje Kulauzov, Marinko Lebović, B. Ljubičić, Stevo Maslek, Nikola Maslovara, Radič Mijatović, Željko Mitrović, Ahmet Muminović, Slavko Pejak, Dušan Pivac, Branko Plavšić, Zdravko Popović, Sibin Slavković (pen name \\"S. Žunjević\\"), Ljubomir Filipov and Adam Čurdinjaković. More than 70 episodes were produced, including a sticker album. Influence The strip inspired Il Grande Blek, a 1987 film directed by Giuseppe Piccioni about a boy who loves comics.

ASCII porn was the world's first Internet pornography,Annalee Newitz, On-the-go porn , salon.com, July 4, 2001. and was popular (among the then fewer computer users) before the invention of the World-Wide Web, and often found on BBSes and other text mode terminal- based systems that could be reached via direct modem dial-up. It was also exchanged via Fidonet and sneakernet and on the early Internet using pre-WWW services such as email, telnet, usenet and gopher. A contributing factor to the relative popularity of ASCII porn in its time was high compatibility: the standard ASCII character set could be displayed on most computer monitors –even on early desktops/terminals incapable of displaying digital imagessuch as for instance original IBM PCs with MDA cards– and could be printed on most printers.Many early computer printers were either incapable of printing graphical images or required custom software support in every program to do so, which was not always implemented. Also, ASCII porn could be composed by hand using nothing more than a text editor, without the need for a model or camera. With the advent of the World-Wide Web, ASCII porn largely slipped into obscurity. Net artists in the late 1990s returned to the form, for instance in the work Deep ASCII, a rendering of the movie Deep Throat, created by Vuk Ćosić of the ASCII Art Ensemble. Concrete poet Florian Cramer also produced ASCII work based on sexually explicit images.Kornelia Freitag, Katharina Vester, Another Language, LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2008, pp. 102-3.

It was the only position along the Bar Lev Line that did not fall to the Egyptians. When the war was over, he organized protests outside the Prime Minister's office which gained widespread public support. The protest movement began as a one-man crusade.

In mid- August 1974, he produced a startling return of 8-13 for Worcestershire II against Lancashire II in a very low-scoring game that was over in a single day.Lancashire Second XI v Worcestershire Second XI, Second Eleven Championship 1974, CricketArchive.

He took 2-32 (including the wicket of Geoff Howarth) from his eight overs in a match curtailed by the weather (Worcestershire were adjudged the winners on run rate), and was picked to play against Glamorgan in the County Championship at the end of the month. He managed only a single wicket in his 21 overs, that of Arthur Francis.

It is about a 12-year-old named Rob Horton who finds a caged tiger in the center of the woods near his home. The book was a National Book Award Finalist. Plot Rob Horton is 12 years old and lives with his father in a Florida motel called the Kentucky Star. His father (named Robert), and Rob have recently moved to Lister, Florida, after the death of Rob's mother, Caroline. Rob is quiet and often is bullied at school. Things begin to change when Rob discovers a tiger in the forest (locked up in a cage) while wandering the woods. He then meets a girl named Sistine Bailey who has recently moved nearby. Rob shows Sistine the tiger. Rob, who usually keeps his feelings locked away begins to involuntarily open up emotionally to Sistine. Though Sistine insists on letting the tiger go, Rob is wary of what will happen to it if he does. Rob finally relents and releases the tiger, letting it run into the woods. However, just moments later, Rob's father shoots the tiger dead. At the tiger's funeral, Sistine recites a part of William Blake's The Tyger. Rob and his father confront their unresolved feelings about Rob's mother and Rob begins looking forward to going to school with Sistine. Sistine Bailey - Sistine (or Sissy) and her mother move to Lister. Sistine is Rob's classmate. Sistine's parents are divorced after her father had an affair with his secretary. As compared to Rob, she is very open emotionally and gets into fights at school. Willie May - Housekeeper of the Kentucky Star. Though uneducated, she gives sage advice to Rob and Sistine, leading Sistine to claim she is a prophetess. She and Rob both have a connection to losing a loved one. Robert Horton - Rob's dad. He works at the Kentucky Star Motel and is underpaid by Beauchamp. Caroline Horton - Rob's mom. She died of cancer before Rob and his dad moved to Lister, Florida. Beauchamp - Owner of the Kentucky Star motel, the woods behind the motel, and the tiger. The Tiger - The tiger is described as a beautiful and poor animal trapped cruelly in a cage where he cannot escape. He paces around in the cage and is fed by Beauchamp and then Rob. After Rob and Sistine let the tiger out of its cage, it was shot by Rob’s dad and died. Norton and Billy Threemonger - Two \\"redneck\\" brothers who bully Rob in school and on the bus. Mrs. Bailey - Sistine's mom. She babies Sistine and forces her to wear dresses.

It is located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore, within the tri-state areas of the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia, Western Maryland, and Southern Pennsylvania.  History  The school was originally the upper school for St. Mary's Catholic School, currently a K-8 day school located in downtown Hagerstown. From 1933 to 1955 the school was known as St. Mary's High School. In 1957, the upper school was relocated to a new campus in Hagerstown's North End and was renamed St. Maria Goretti High School in honor of the Italian saint Maria Goretti, who \\"lost her life at the age of 11 in order to protect her purity\\". The campus sits adjacent to St. Ann Roman Catholic Church. For much of the school's history, its faculty and administration was composed partly of members of the School Sisters of Notre Dame. However, in the 1980s and 1990s the high school grew increasingly reliant on lay faculty. Currently, the faculty and administration are entirely from the laity, though the school continues to have a chaplain. Goretti has approximately 225 pupils.  Athletics  St. Maria Goretti is a member of the Baltimore Catholic League in basketball, and a member of the Crossroad Lacrosse League and Metro Independent Lacrosse League in lacrosse. In men's soccer, the school won championships in 2003, 2005, 2008, and 2010. The school also competes in swimming. Notable alumni * John P.

It was the biggest commercial success of the RWD. Development The RWD 13 was a touring plane, developed from a line of sports planes RWD 6 (a winner of Challenge 1932 international touring aircraft contest) and RWD 9 (a winner of Challenge 1934). It was designed by Stanisław Rogalski and Jerzy Drzewiecki of the RWD team, in the DWL workshops (Doświadczalne Warsztaty Lotnicze) in Warsaw, for and order of the LOPP paramilitary organization. The prototype was constructed using parts of a broken up RWD 6 (initially it was even supposed to be designated RWD 6bis), but its construction was more similar to newer RWD 9. It first flew on 15 January 1935 (registration SP-AOA). Since the RWD 13 was not supposed to be a competition aircrft, the main differences from the RWD 9 were: an inline engine with lower power output, instead of a radial engine, and simpler wing mechanization. It still had advantages, like short take-off and landing and ease of flying, with good stability. By 1939, some 85 were produced. RWD 13 with Walter Major 4 (SP-AOA), first flight on January 15, 1935 In 1937 an air ambulance variant RWD 13S was built (prototype markings SP-BFN), with a starboard hatch for stretchers in the fuselage. There was also developed a similar universal variant RWD 13TS (or ST, or S/T), that could be converted from a touring plane to an ambulance by removing the right-hand seat. By 1939, 15 RWD 13S were made, including a few RWD 13TS. A development of the RWD 13 was the five-seater RWD 15. A licence was sold to Yugoslavia in 1938 and made four RWD 13, and two RWD 13s were produced 1939 there by Rogožarski. All four RWD 13s were converted in 1939 into ambulance RWD 13S aircraft.Петровић, Огњан М. (3/2004.). \\"Војни аероплани Краљевине СХС/Југославије (Део II: 1931 – 1941.)\\" (in (Serbian)). Лет - Flight 3: 42-44. . A flying replica of the RWD 13 is under construction in Poland (as of 2008). Design Three-seater sports and touring strutted high-wing monoplane of a mixed construction. A fuselage of a metal frame, covered with canvas, in engine section with aluminium sheets. Two-spar rectangular wing of wooden construction, covered with canvas and plywood in front. Wings folded rearwards, and were equipped with automatic slats. Cantilever empennage, covered with plywood (stabilizers) and canvas (rudder and elevators). Closed cabin with three seats: two front seats fitted with dual controls, behind them a third seat and a space for a luggage. The cabin had a pair of doors. In RWD 13S there were two seats on the left side, and stretchers on the right. The single engine in front was a 4-cylinder air-cooled inverted straight engine 130 hp Walter Major 4, PZInż. Major (licensed Walter Major), or a de Havilland Gipsy Major. The propeller was a two-blade wooden Szomański of a fixed pitch. The landing gear was conventional, with a rear skid. The fuel tanks were in the wings with a capacity of 140 L. Fuel consumption of the aircraft was 28 litres/hour. Operational history Poland Most RWD 13s were used by the Polish civilian aviation, initially, the Polish Aero Club (they were funded by the Ministry of Communication or the LOPP paramilitary organization - Air and Anti-gas Defence League). Three were used by the Ministry of Communication as utility aircraft, two were used by the LOT Polish Airlines, and several were in hands of private owners and companies. The Polish Aero Club aircraft were also used for sport flying, taking part in numerous international contests and rallies, taking high places. Among others, they took the 1st, 4th, 6th and 7th places in a touring aircraft competition during the 4th International Air Meeting in Zurich in 1937. The RWD 13S won a prize of Esch town for the best air ambulance of an International Ambulance Aircraft Contest in Esch, Luxembourg in July 1938 (the contest itself was won by another Polish plane, the LWS-2). RWD 13 'SP-BNU' in the Polish Aviation Museum Most air ambulances RWD 13S belonged to the Polish Red Cross, five to the Polish Air Force, but they carried civilian markings as well. Several (at least five) RWD 13, not counting air ambulances, were mobilized after the start of World War II and used as liaison aircraft during the Polish September Campaign. Some aircraft were evacuated to neighbouring countries, some were destroyed or seized by the Germans. Most Polish RWD 13 were painted red, with a silver lightning painted on a fuselage and silver wings. RWD 13S were painted in ivory, with Red Cross markings, while RWD 13TS were painted in ivory, with a red lightning on the fuselage. Only four RWD 13 were used in Poland after the war, that were returned by Romania in 1947 (in 1948 the Polish communist government lost interest in all Polish pre-war equipment remaining abroad). They were used until 1953-1955, with registrations: SP-MSZ (owned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, MSZ in short), SP-ARG, SP-ARH, SP-ARL. SP-ARL is currently preserved in the Polish Aviation Museum in Kraków, with its pre-war registration SP-BNU (formerly used by LOT Polish Airlines). Spain Around 20 RWD 13s were exported before World War II. Four were sold to Spain by SEPEWE and were used as liaison aircraft by Franco's Aviación Nacional during the Spanish Civil War, under the name Polaca (numbers: 30-1 - 30-4). After the civil war, the remaining ones were used in aero clubs. Brasil In 1937-1938, eight RWD 13 were sold to Brazil and used there until the 1960s. One of them still remains in airworthy condition (PT-LFY). Palestine/Israel VQ-PAL dropping supplies to isolated Yehiam, northern Palestine, January 1948 Two or three RWD 13 were sold to Jewish owners in Palestine. With the formation of the Sherut Avir, the air arm of the Haganah, in November 1947 two were included in its inventory. On 17 December 1947, one of them undertook the first air attack, with hand grenades and handguns, during the Israeli-Arab skirmishes (earlier, on 15 June 1936, an RWD 13 was the first aircraft to land in Tel Aviv). The two RWD 13s were among the first aircraft of the newly created Israeli Air Force, and were used for liaison and transport during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Romania After the outbreak of World War II, 28 Polish RWD 13 were evacuated to Romania (23 RWD 13 and 5 RWD 13S). After the fall of Poland, they were taken over by Romanian civil and military aviation. After Romania joined the war on the Axis side and took part in the attack on the USSR, RWD 13 were used as liaison aircraft by the Air Force. Especially famous were air ambulances, used by the \\"Escadrila Albă\\" (White Squadron), flown by women. Twenty-one survived the war and the remaining ones were used in Romania until the 1950s. Other countries A single aircraft was used in Estonia. Two RWD 13, sent to the World's Fair, were sold after the outbreak of war in 1939 and used in the United States (N20651 and N20652), where their structure was modified by Lt. Joseph Malejki. Three (or one) aircraft were sold to Yemen. Several RWD 13 were evacuated to Latvia and they were probably later seized by the Soviets.

Some are created through simple modifications, such as cracked drum cymbals or metal objects inserted between piano strings in a prepared piano. Some experimental instruments are created from household items like a homemade mute for brass instruments such as bathtub plugs. Other experimental instruments are created from electronic spare parts, or by mixing acoustic instruments with electric components. The instruments created by the earliest 20th-century builders of experimental musical instruments, such as Luigi Russolo (1885–1947), Harry Partch (1901–1974), and John Cage (1912–1992), were not well received by the public at the time of their invention. Even mid-20th century builders such as Ivor Darreg, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry did not gain a great deal of popularity. However, by the 1980s and 1990s, experimental musical instruments gained a wider audience when they were used by bands such as Einstürzende Neubauten and Neptune. Types Video of a hydraulophone; song is \\"Huron Carol\\"; \\"Une Jeune Pucelle\\" Experimental musical instruments are made from a wide variety of materials, using a range of different sound-production techniques. Some of the simplest instruments are percussion instruments made from scrap metal, like those created by German band Einstürzende Neubauten. Some experimental hydraulophones have been made using sewer pipes and plumbing fittings. Since the late 1960s, many experimental musical instruments have incorporated electric or electronic components, such as Fifty Foot Hose 1967-era homemade synthesizers, Wolfgang Flür and Florian Schneider's playable electronic percussion pads, and Future Man's homemade drum machine made out of spare parts and his electronic Synthaxe Drumitar. Some experimental musical instruments are created by luthiers, who are trained in the construction of string instruments. Some custom made string instruments are employed with three bridges,Moodswinger - Experimental electric zither musical instrument, unique and unusual instead of the usual two (counting the nut as a bridge). By adding a third bridge, one can create a number of unusual sounds reminiscent of chimes, bells or harpsPrepared Guitar Techniques - Matthew Elgart/Peter Yates (Elgart/Yates Guitar Duo) , California Guitar Archives, 1990 A 'third bridge instrument' can be a \\"prepared guitar\\" modified with an object – for instance, a screwdriver – placed under the strings to act as a makeshift bridge, or it can be a custom made instrument. One of the first guitarists who began building instruments with an extra bridge was Fred Frith. Guitarist and composer Glenn Branca has created similar instruments which he calls harmonic guitars or mallet guitars. Since the 1970s, German guitarist and luthier Hans Reichel has created guitars with third-bridge-like qualities. Modern-day low voltage electronic experimental musical instruments, can be found at Bentmonkeycage in California. These glitched instruments are used in movie soundtracks, Live DUBNOISE performances, DJ performances, and recording. The electronic unengineered circuitry within the device can be manipulated with simple body contacts, light sensitive photocells, infrared signals, and radio waves (as in a theremin). History 1900–1950s Luigi Russolo and his intonarumori Luigi Russolo (1885–1947) was an Italian Futurist painter and composer, and the author of the manifestoes The Art of Noises (1913) and Musica Futurista. Russolo invented and built instruments including intonarumori (\\"intoners\\" or \\"noise machines\\"), to create \\"noises\\" for performance. Unfortunately, none of his original intonarumori survived World War II. Replicas are being made though. Léon Theremin was a Russian inventor, most famous for his invention of the theremin around 1919–1920, one of the first electronic musical instruments. The Ondes Martenot is another early example of an electronic musical instrument. The luthéal is a type of prepared piano created by George Cloetens in the late 1890s and used by Maurice Ravel in his Tzigane for luthéal and violin. The instrument can produce sounds like a guitar or a harmonica, with strange tick-tocking sounds. It had several tone-colour (not exclusively \\"pitch\\") registers that could be engaged by pulling stops above the keyboard. One of these registers had a cimbalom-like sound, which fitted well with the gypsy-esque idea of the composition. Partch's chromelodion Harry Partch (1901–1974) was an American composer and instrument builder. He was one of the first twentieth-century composers to work extensively and systematically with microtonal scales, writing much of his music for custom-made instruments he built himself, tuned in 11-limit just intonation. His adapted instruments include the adapted viola, three adapted guitars, and a 10-string fretless guitar. As well, he retuned the reeds of several reed organs and designed and built many instruments from raw materials, including the Diamond Marimba, Cloud Chamber Bowls, the Spoils of War, and a Gourd Tree. Christian Wolff removes prepared objects John Cage (1912–1992) was an American composer who pioneered the fields of chance music, electronic music and unorthodox use of musical instruments. Cage's prepared piano pieces used a piano with its sound altered by placing various objects in the strings. He was the first to use phonograph records as musical instruments (in his 1939 composition Imaginary Landscape No.1). Cage also devised ways to perform using sounds which were nearly inaudible by incorporating photograph cartridges and contact microphones (his 1960 composition Cartridge Music). Ivor Darreg (1917–1994) was a leading proponent of and composer of microtonal or \\"xenharmonic\\" music. He also created a series of experimental musical instruments. In the 1940s, Darreg built an amplified cello, amplified clavichord and an electric keyboard drum. 1950s–1960s Kraftwerk is known for their homemade synthesizers in the early 70s. In the 1960s, Michel Waisvisz and Geert Hamelberg developed the Kraakdoos (or Cracklebox), a custom made battery-powered noise-making electronic device. It is a small box with six metal contacts on top, which when pressed by fingers will generate a range of unusual sounds and tones. The human body becomes a part of the circuit and determines the range of sounds possible; different people will generate different sounds. 1970s–1980s Neola stringed musical instrument The neola is a tenor stringed musical instrument invented in 1970 by Goronwy Bradley Davies, Llanbedr, Wales. Plastics and aluminium were used in the design and the invention was recognized in a British Patent (registered 16 August 1972) and a Design Council award. The name \\"Neola\\" was registered for the instrument.stringed musical instruments The invention is intended as a tenor, replacing an instrument in the viol family that has been surpassed by the more recent violin family. The strings are tuned to G2, D3, A3, and E4, an octave below the violin, and the instrument may be performed similar to a violoncello. ‘Cello players would need to adapt their technique to accommodate the shorter string and body length, and use of the thumb position would not be the same. The design specifications are well suited to industrial manufacture, retaining consistency in quality. This is not the case with traditional instruments since the choice of fine materials and the skills of the luthier are essential in producing instruments with superior sound qualities. In the mid-1970s, Allan Gittler (1928–2003) made an experimental custom-made instrument called the Gittler guitar. The Gittler guitar has 6 strings, each string has its own pickup. The later versions have a plastic body. The steel frets give the instrument a sitar-like feel. Six individual pick ups can be routed to divided outputs. Z'EV and Einstürzende Neubauten made several percussion instruments out of trash. No Wave artist Glenn Branca began building 3rd bridge zithers with an additional movable bridge positioned on the just intoned knotted positions of the harmonic series. Hans Reichel (Born 1949) is a German improvisational guitarist, luthier, and inventor. Reichel has constructed and built several variations of guitars and basses, most of them featuring multiple fretboards and unique positioning of pickups as well as the same indirect playing technique as Branca's instruments. The resulting sounds exceed the range of conventional tuning and add interesting effects, from odd overtones to metallic noises. Later he invented his Daxophone, where he's most famous for. His Daxophone consists of a single wooden blade fixed in a block containing a contact microphone. Normally, it is played by bowing the free end, but it can also be struck or plucked, which propagates sound in the same way a ruler halfway off a table does. These vibrations then continue to the wooden-block base, which in turn is amplified by the contact microphone(s) therein. A wide range of voice-like timbres can be produced, depending on the shape of the instrument, the type of wood, where it is bowed, and where along its length it is stopped with a separate block of wood (fretted on one side) called the \\"dax.\\" American composer Ellen Fullman (born in 1957) developed a Long String instrument in the early 1980s, which is tuned in just intonation and played by walking along the length of the long strings and rubbing them with rosined hands and producing longitudinal vibrations. Bradford Reed invented the pencilina, a custom-made string instrument in the 1980s. It is a double-neck 3rd bridge guitar that is similar in construction to two long, thin zithers connected by a stand. Wedged over and under the strings in each neck is an adjustable rod, a wooden drum stick for the guitar strings and a metal rod for the bass strings. In addition, there are four bells. The pencilina is played by striking its strings and bells with sticks. The strings may also be plucked or bowed. Uakti (WAHK-chee) is a Brazilian instrumental musical group active in the 1980s known for using custom-made instruments built by the group. Marco Antônio constructed various instruments in his basement out of PVC pipe, wood, and metal. Remo Saraceni made a number of Synthesizer type instruments with unusual interfaces, his most famous being The Walking piano made famous in the film Big. In the 1980s, the folgerphone was developed. It is a wind instrument (or aerophone), classifiable as a woodwind rather than brass instrument despite being made of metal, because it has a reed (cf. saxophone). It is made from an alto sax mouthpiece, with copper tubing and a coffee can. Although it uses sax parts, it is a cylindrical bore instrument, and thus part of the clarinet family. In India, the new instrument based on harmonium style was developed by Pt. Manohar Chimote with the combination of keys and sympathetic strings to create the tone most suitable for solo playing. This was named as \\"Samvadini\\". It is based on just intonation tuning system and played in one key. It is exclusive solo instrument with great potentials. His follower Jitendra Gore now plays this solo instrument. 1990s and 2000s Two electrocardiophones and one electroencephalophone, which use brain waves to generate or modulate sounds. The bazantar is a five-string double bass with 29 sympathetic and 4 drone strings and has a melodic range of five octaves invented by musician Mark Deutsch, who worked on the design between 1993 and 1997 ( issued March 16, 1999). It is designed as a separate housing for sympathetic strings (to deal with the increased string tension) mountable on a double bass or cello, modified to hold drone strings. Ken Butler makes odd-shaped, guitar-like instruments made out of trash, rifles and other material. He also builds violins in eccentric shapes. Cor Fuhler (1964) is a Dutch/Australian improvising musician, composer and instrument builder, known for his pioneering extended piano techniques. He created the keyolin in the 1990s. The keyolin is a 2-string violin played via a mechanical keyboard, which controls pitch, vibrato, glissandos and partials. A customised bow, played upside down, controls timbre and volume. Iner Souster (born in 1971) is a builder of experimental musical instruments, visual artist, musician, fauxbot designer and film maker who lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Souster builds most of his instruments from trash, found, and salvaged materials. Some of his instruments are one-string string instruments, or thumb pianos. One of his more complicated instruments is the \\"Bowafridgeaphone\\" (bow a fridge a phone). Leila Bela is an Iranian-born American avant-garde musician and record producer from Austin, Texas. The Japanese multi-instrumentalist and experimental musical instrument builder Yuichi Onoue developed a two string hurdy-gurdy like a fretless violin, called the Kaisatsuko, as well as a deeply scalloped electric guitar for microtonal playing techniques.Yuichi Onoue's Kaisatsuko on hypercustom.com Solmania from Japan, and Neptune are noise music bands that built their own custom made guitars and basses. Solmania modifies their instruments with extra droning strings. Neptune built guitars out of scrap metal and make electric lamellophones. The bass is built using a VCR casing and another one of their instruments has a jagged scythe at the end of it. They also play on custom made percussion instruments and electric lamellophones. Neptune began in 1994 as a student art project by sculptor/musician Jason Sanford. In 2006 Neptune signed with Table of the Elements, an experimental record label that also has performers such as Rhys Chatham, John Cale, and Captain Beefheart on its roster. The Blue Man Group also experimented with home-made percussive instruments, made from PVC pipes and other materials. A specially-constructed studio was needed for the recording of their first album. In the mid 1990s, Californian nu metal band Motograter invented the eponymous instrument in place of a bass guitar. The Motograter is made out of 2 large industrial springs mounted on a metal platform, producing unique chunky guitar and bass tones with a strong \\"RRRRRR\\" sound. The Motograter's sound is loosely comparable with a slow running cutting/drilling device. Founded in 1998, The Vegetable Orchestra use instruments made entirely from fresh vegetables. In the 2000s, Canadian luthier Linda Manzer created the Pikasso guitar, a 42-string guitar with three necks. It was popularized by jazz guitarist Pat Metheny, who used it on the song \\"Into the Dream\\" and on several albums. Its name is ostensibly derived from its likeness in appearance to the cubist works of Pablo Picasso. In 2000, Felix Rohner and Sabina Schärer developed the hang in Bern, Switzerland. In 2003 the Tritare was created by Samuel Gaudet and Claude Gauthier in Canada. Experimental luthier Yuri Landman built a variety of electric string resonance tailed bridge and 3rd bridge guitars like the Moodswinger, Moonlander and the Springtime for indie rock and noise rock acts like Sonic Youth, Liars, Blood Red Shoes as well as electric thumb pianos, electric drum guitars, and spring drum instruments. Bašić's sea organ, which creates sound from sea waves by using tubes built under the marble steps In 2005, architect Nikola Bašić built a Sea organ in Zadar, Croatia, which is an experimental musical instrument which plays music by way of sea waves and tubes located underneath a set of large marble steps. Concealed under these steps is a system of polyethylene tubes and a resonating cavity that turns the site into a huge musical instrument, played by the wind and the sea. The waves create somewhat random but harmonic sounds. Instigated by composer-researcher Georg Hajdu in 2006, Stephen Fox (clarinet maker) of Toronto, Canada, began building a new class of clarinets, called BP clarinets, able to play the Bohlen–Pierce scale of 146.3 cents per step.Müller, Nora-Louise, Konstantina Orlandatou, and Georg Hajdu. \\"Starting Over – Chances Afforded by a New Scale,\\" pp. 127 and 171 in 1001 Mikrotöne / 1001 Microtones, edited by Sarvenaz Safari and Manfred Stahnke. Neumünster: von Bockel Verlag, 2015. To date two available sizes are played by a small but growing number of professional clarinettists in Canada, the US, Germany and Estonia, with two more sizes under consideration. Starting in 2006, Ice Music Festival celebrates musical instruments made of ice. In 2010, composer Alexis Kirke and technologist Tim Hodgson turned the University of Plymouth's Roland Levinsky Building into a form of musical instrument to be played by the rising sun, as part of Peninsula Arts Contemporary Music Festival. Light sensors were placed across seven floors of the building and fed by radio network into a computer music instrument analogous to a Mellotron. As the sun rose the \\"Sunlight Symphony\\" played in the reverberant space of the Roland Levinsky Building's open plan foyer. For her 2011 album Biophilia, Icelandic artist Björk developed an instrument based on a Tesla Coil and a second instrument described as a cross between a Gamelan and a Celesta, dubbed the \\"Gameleste.\\" In 2013, a research team of McGill University came up with digital musical instruments made in the form of Musical Prostheses. In 2014, Andrei Remyannikov of Russia developed the RAV vast drum.

A leader of Constructivism in 1925-1931, Ilya Golosov later developed his own style of early stalinist architecture known as postconstructivism. Не was a brother of Panteleimon Golosov. Career Education, World War I, Revolution Golosov studied in the Stroganov School of Arts and Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, graduating in 1912. Before World War I, he trained in the workshops of Igor Grabar and Alexey Shchusev, and collaborated with Marian Peretyatkovich and Ivan Rerberg on Northern Insurance Buildings (Moscow). In 1914-1917 Golosov served as a military engineer. In 1918, Golosov joined Moscow state architectural office led by neoclassicist Ivan Zholtovsky, and stayed with him throughout the Civil war, at the same time teaching at the MVTU and VKhUTEMAS. Developing style (1918-1925) Golosov's work during the Civil War and first years of New Economic Policy was limited to city planning projects, landscaping and repairs. A decade of hostilities (1914–1922) caused an unexpected outcome for the profession and Golosov brothers personally: their first chance to build anything emerged when they were already 40 years old. The \\"new generation\\" were, in fact, mature men with classic prerevolutionary training; the next generation (Ivan Leonidov and the class of 1929) was just beginning their college training. Ilya Golosov participated in numerous architectural contests of the twenties, starting with the 1922-1923 House of Labor contest. Golosov developed a personal design style, when the building had to have a center of mass, a dominant shape; all smaller shapes and details are subordinate to the dominant and should follow a decreasing rhythm, like a ripple on water surface. Golosov himself defined this style as symbolic romanticism, well before joining the constructivist camp. Constructivism (1925-1932) In 1924, Golosov was profoundly impressed by Vesnin brothers designs of Arkos and Leningrad Pravda. Unlike his brother Panteleimon, he not joined the constructivist movement, the OSA Group at its inception in December, 1925. Golosov's designs of this period feature carefully thought-out exterior glass walls, emphasizing inner structure of the dominant shape. Apart from numerous contest entries, Golosov won many practical commissions. Like the Vesnin brothers, he had a formal pre-revolutionary education and engineering experience, helping him win the real jobs. Unlike theorists like Moisei Ginzburg or Ivan Leonidov, Golosov was busy with actually managing construction sites, and abstained from theoretical the debates of 1925-1929. As Selim Khan-Magomedov pointed out, \\"He created the finest examples of constructivism, yet never became a devoted constructivist. He understood that constructivist theories contradict his own architectonic concepts of early 20s... Golosov accepted constructivism as an exterior decoration trend, not as a wholesome functional style\\". Yet, for a brief period in 1925-1928, fellow architects perceived him as the leader of constructivism, due to his highly publicized completed designs like the 1927-1929 Zuev Workers' Club (see also: interior photograph) and a brilliant streak of contest entries in 1926. Image:Дом коллектива (2015).jpgCollective House, 1930-1931 Image:Zuev Workers' Club - Moscow (1928).jpgZuev Workers' Club, 1927-1929 Postconstructivism (1932-1941) In 1932, when the state sent a message to abandon avant-garde in favor of neoclassical architecture, Golosov responded with a neoclassical adaptation of his symbolic romanticism concept. Golosov and his followers deliberately replaced the proven historical details (columns, capitals, friezes and cornices) with their own inventions - to differentiate themselves from pure Revivalists like Zholtovsky. The most common feature was a square, lean column with a simplified rectangular capital and base. For a short period, 1932–1936, this new style, postconstructivism (a term coined by Selim Khan-Magomedov), became the most common in Soviet Russia. Ilya Golosov, assigned to lead a Mossovet architectural workshop, perfected his style in numerous contests of 1932-1938. Unlike Konstantin Melnikov, who lost his job in 1936, Golosov was employed in practical construction until 1941 with typical postconstructivist building like the Teplobeton apartments on Spiridonovka Street (1933–34) and Yauzsky Boulevard apartments (1936–1941). In 1938, he designed and managed construction of a typical Stalinist apartment block in Nizhny Novgorod (Oktyabrskaya Street), which earned an honorable posthumous mention in \\"XXX years of Soviet architecture\\" edition in 1949.

Yauzsky Boulevard, 2, fragment Death and legacy Ilya Golosov continued teaching architecture throughout World War II. Like his brother Panteleimon, Ilya died in 1945 in Moscow and was interred at Novodevichye cemetery.Burial at Novodevichye is a clear sign of high social status.

The opera was commissioned by the Houston Grand Opera, which premiered it on April 24, 1981, in a production directed by Harold Prince and conducted by John DeMain. The original production was dedicated to the American radio journalist Lowell Thomas. Floyd made cuts to the score for a television presentation of the opera, and the edited version was shown on US public television in September 1981. The opera was remounted in 2007 by the Louisiana State University Opera. The composer visited the university and advised on the production. The production was recorded and released on DVD, by Newport Classic. The work generated some small controversy among music critics, as it draws upon elements of Broadway musical theater more than Floyd's other more traditionally operatic works. The involvement of Broadway director Harold Prince in the initial production contributed to the emphasis of these elements of the work. In the years since its premiere, this sort of blurring of boundaries between opera and Broadway musicals has become commonplace.

The story covers a period of 10 days. Willie Stark is a southern American politician, of humble origin, now a state governor. He began his political career as an idealist and champion of the working class, but as his career progresses, he becomes more and more corrupt, shrewd and ruthless, willing to stretch the boundaries of the law as far as he can. The plot involves Governor Stark's attempts to avoid impeachment for his tampering with his state's legal system for his own ends, by which he has ruined many lives. Meanwhile, he falls in love with socialite Anne Stanton. Anne is engaged to marry Jack Burden, the Governor's aide. Judge Burden, Jack's father, is a highly respected judge and favors impeaching Stark. Willie tries to persuade Anne to break off her engagement with Jack and marry him instead, which she finally agrees to do. The governor’s longtime political associate and advisor, Sadie Burke, finds Willie Stark and Anne together. Sadie is furious at this, and realizes that she is no longer the only woman in his life. At one point, Judge Burden is charged with bribery. Jack finds evidence to support the accusation, though he does not want to believe the evidence. Jack confronts his father, after which Judge Burden commits suicide, with a pistol hidden in his desk. A few days later, Jack is distraught to learn from Sadie of Anne’s plans to marry the Governor. At the end, Willie is giving a speech to a crowd. Jack emerges from the crowd and assassinates the Governor, and in turn, Jack is killed.

It marks the original boundaries of Jeffersonville, and is the heart of modern-day downtown Jeffersonville. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The area is roughly bounded by Court Avenue at the North, Graham Street on the east, the Ohio River at the south, and Interstate 65 at the west. In total, the district has 203 acres (0.8 km2), 500 buildings, 6 structures, and 11 objects. Several banks are located in the historic buildings in the district. The now defunct Steamboat Days Festival, held on the second weekend in September, used to be held on Spring Street and the waterfront. Jeffersonville's largest fire wiped out a block in the historic district on January 11, 2004 which destroyed the original Horner's Novelty store. Several important buildings are located in the district. At Warder Park the old Carnegie Library still stands, one of many built throughout Indiana in the early 20th century. Across Spring Street from Warder Park is the Old Masonic Temple, built in the early 20th century, with a majestic marble staircase. The local office of the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana maintains the historic Grisamore House, its former office, and the Willey-Allhands House, its current office, which are located beside each other. Schimpff's Confectionery is well known its candies, especially its red-hots and Modjelskas (a caramel-covered marshmallow confection). Horner's Novelty, a long-time commercial supplier of party supplies and costumes that was rebuilt after a fire, is also included in the landmark boundaries. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. History Big Four Bridge The first settlement in what later became Jeffersonville was just above the Falls of the Ohio, the only natural barrier along the entire length of the Ohio River. Because of its location above the falls, Jeffersonville has the deepest harbor of any nearby town.Hedgepeth pp. 1, 9–12 The settlement was established in 1786 at Finney, near the present day Big Four Bridge. In June 1802, Lieutenant Isaac Bowman had of land, known as Section No. 1, awarded to him for his service in the American Revolutionary War as part of Clark's Grant. Jeffersonville started as three streets that paralleled the Ohio River: Water Street (gone), Front Street (Riverside Drive) and Market Street. In 1802 John Gwathemey was appointed to plat the land north of Market Street using a plan devised by Thomas Jefferson. This plan deviated from Jefferson's original with the use of diagonal streets in the open checkerboard. By 1816 this plan proved to be unworkable and was re-platted by order of the Indiana Legislature (An Act to Change the Plan of the Town of Jeffersonville) in 1817. In 1836 a Cincinnati civil engineer (H. L. Barnum) was hired to plot the northern expansion of the town. This plan was again an attempt to use Jefferson's original. The plan was rejected by the town council and another plan from a local civil engineer (Edmund F. Lee) was accepted. At the time Cincinnati was the major town in the area and subsequent map makers used the Barnum map as their primary source. Consequently, most maps of Jeffersonville from 1837 to about 1852 are in error. From its heyday of the 1850s until the Great Depression in the 1930s, Jeffersonville was the leading center of U.S. steamboat production, due largely to its excellent harbor, which remained the deepest in the surrounding area. Many individuals who lived in the district worked at the Howard Shipyards, that became Jeffboat in the nearby town of Port Fulton, which was eventually annexed into Jeffersonville. The town gained its first railroad in 1852, connecting to Columbus, Indiana, and with the opening of the Fourteenth Street Bridge in 1870, became a railroad center. The city became an important distribution center during the Civil War for the Union Army, because three railroads connected to Jeffersonville and because the Ohio River served as a defensive barrier against invasion from Confederate attack, it was deemed a safer location than the more vulnerable city of Louisville, Kentucky located on the southern side of the river.Hedgepeth pp. 7–9 Most of the buildings still standing in the district were built after 1870. The majority of the commercial buildings along Spring Street are Italianate styles and Gothic Revival churches reflecting the large immigrations from Ireland and Germany that came during the time period. The residential buildings are generally of the American Four Square style, bungalows, and shotgun houses.Kramer p. 99 Until the mid-1950s, the district was a significant commercial area, including a J.C.Penney department store. However, with the construction of Youngstown Shopping Center northwest of the downtown area on 10th Street/Indiana State Road 62, the district began its decline. The decline was completed when Green Tree Mall was built in the 1960s, taking Penney's with it. By the 1980s over twenty store fronts were empty, leaving the bulk of the stores in the district occupied by antique shops, thrift stores, or repair technicians.Kramer pp. 394, 428, 429) Streets The district is served by a northwest–southeast primary road called Spring Street. From Spring Street are five secondary streets going southwest to northeast; starting from the Ohio River and going the north the secondary streets are Riverside Drive, Market Street, Chestnut Street, Maple Street, and ending with Court Avenue. Spring Street, a typical commercial 19th century corridor, is the primary roadway within the district. Most buildings along Spring Street are Italianate and eclectic Victorian. The structure vary between two and three stories tall, with brick as the most common building material. The 100 block is the closest to the Ohio River and has seen the most demolition. It contains the Old Strauss Hotel at the corner of Riverside Drive, a three-story Italianate hostelry with a corbeled cornice and arched windows. The buildings on the 200 block are mostly Italianate style buildings, the most notable being the old Elk's Club structure (a three-story highly decorated glazed brick building) and the Bensinger's Building (a 1920s commercial building of pressed brick and crenelated parapet). There is more diverse architecture on the 300-block, with a 19th-century Masonic Temple, the LaRose Theatre (a 1920s orange glazed brick structure with terra cotta trim), Horner's Novelty (which had to be rebuilt after the worst fire in Jeffersonville's history), and Schimpff's Confectionery, a candy store that opened in 1891 that now also features a small candy museum. More Italianate structures are on the 400 block, but its most important structure is the 1907 Citizens National Bank Building, which is stone Classical Revival with large eagles for adornment. The block also holds the regional office for the local Boy Scouts of America council. Warder Park is located on the east side of the 500 block and features a Classical Revival Masonic Temple that used for most of the 20th Century.Hedgepeth pp. 1–2 At the southeast end of Spring Street is Riverside Drive, which provides some of the most scenic views of the Ohio River and the eastern Louisville shoreline because of the limited alterations compared to other sections of the Ohio River in the Louisville area. Houseboats are docked along the Ohio River on the south side of Riverside Drive. The north side of Riverside Drive has a variety of architectural styles and is mostly residential. Unlike the other prominent streets, Riverside drive is outside the flood-wall that surrounds most of the city and was built two feet higher than the height the Ohio River flood of 1937.Hedgepeth p. 2 Grisamore House Market Street is largely residential, its 200 block has many vacant areas, but the 300–500 blocks features many shotgun houses. As Market Streets proceeds eastward out of the district, it becomes known as Utica Pike near the Howard Steamboat Museum and connects Jeffersonville with Utica, Indiana.Hedgepeth pp. 2–3 North of Market Street, few buildings remain that date before 1850, making the character of the district during the early time frame unknowable. Chestnut Street is also largely residential. The 200 block of West Chestnut features old supports for the Big Four Bridge and the 100 block of West Chestnut holds the Grisamore House, which was separately placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. On East Chestnut, the 100 block contains many houses built around 1900 and the 200 block is filled with bungalows. St. Augustine Roman Catholic Church, a Spanish-flavored neo-Baroque structure with a Moorish-styled rectory, is located on the 300 block of East Chestnut. Another church is located on the 400 block including the Gothic Revival style First Presbyterian Church (with lancet windows and belltower), and a typical Works Progress Administration Art Modern school whose cruciform plan has a stuccoed facade and metal casement windows.Hedgepeth pp. 3–4 Warder Park Maple Street features more commercial enterprises than the previous southwest–northeast streets. The 100 block of West Maple Street is dominated by parking lots and a funeral home. The Olde Towne Grocery, originally built in the 1920s as a Krogers and later an A&P;, and a collectibles store named Hockeyman's are located across from each other on the 100 block of East Maple. The 200 block of East Maple Street is mostly residential, with four large Victorian homes and a large office building used by the Indiana Bell Telephone Company. The 300–800 blocks of East Maple are residential and are mostly American Four-Square in construction. The blocks also contain a few Gothic- Revival churches,Hedgepeth pp. 4–5 The northernmost street is Court Avenue, sections of which are part of the historic district and others, having seen new construction, are not part of the district; only the 100 West, 100 East, and 700–900 East Blocks of Court Avenue are in the district. This allows for Warder Park and eastern residential areas, but not the current Jeffersonville Township Public Library and the Clark County Courthouse. This was the site of the Falls City Area Center, a community college that eventually moved to New Albany and became Indiana University Southeast.Hedgepeth pp. 7–8 Warder Park was also the site of an important Civil War bakery, which furnished hardtack for thousands of Union soldiers.Kleber p. 443 Gallery File:Jeff Spring Street.jpgSpring Street of the Historic District File:Willey-Allhands House.jpgWilley-Allhands House File:2004 fire in the historical district of Jeffersonville, Indiana.jpgFire in 2004 that destroyed Horner's See also *List of attractions and events in the Louisville metropolitan area *New Albany Downtown Historic District *Old Clarksville Site Notes References * * * External links *Historic Landmarks Foundation dedicates new Jeffersonville office — News story from October 2004 *Downtown Jeffersonville Historic Sites Historic District Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Indiana Category:Works Progress Administration in Indiana Category:Geography of Clark County, Indiana Category:Tourist attractions in Clark County, Indiana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Clark County, Indiana ","title":"Old Jeffersonville Historic District"},{"id":"6890191","text":"Weisslingen is a municipality in the district of Pfäffikon in the canton of Zürich in Switzerland.

History Founded by filmmaker Matt Pizzolo and organized by Kings Mob Productions, the festival initially launched as part of a “Do-it-Yourself Filmmaking Workshop” that Pizzolo and partner Katie Nisa ran after rough cut screenings of their cult movie “Threat.” The workshops were attended by a diverse, cross-subcultural audience largely from the independent film, digital hardcore, underground hip hop, hardcore punk, alternative media, and culture jamming scenes. Pizzolo observed that the DiY mediamakers shared a common ideology but developed their art in isolation from one another, so he expanded the workshop into the larger forum of DiY-Fest with the intention of engendering cross-subcultural DiY collaborations.

In 2001, Digital Hardcore Recordings released the fest- soundtrack CD “DiY-Fest” compiling spoken word clips from people such as Howard Zinn and Jello Biafra with underground music ranging from agit-prop folk musician Ani Difranco to hip hop artists The Arsonists. Standout tracks on the album included the original collaborations “43% Burnt [remix]” (math- rockers Dillinger Escape Plan with noise-artists Atari Teenage Riot) and “Ghetto Birds [remix]” (hip hop songstress Mystic with breakbeat diva Nic Endo) . These collaborations were conceived by Pizzolo, who was so pleased by the results that he used them as the template for the mash-up album “Threat: Music That Inspired The Movie.” Steininger, Alex. \\"DiY-Fest CD review\\".

The organizers of DiY-Fest observed porn as being independent media and were among the first to recognize and include gonzo, female-owned adult company Shane’s World as a DiY organization. DiY-Fest also hosted Suicide Girls at events when the site was still obscure, and, in a clever and controversial twist on the “Do it Yourself” theme, DiY-Fest partnered with female-owned sex shop Toys In Babeland to give away free vibrators at live events.

Networks of electric clocks connected by wires to a precision master pendulum clock began to be used in institutions like factories, offices, and schools around 1900. Today, many radio clocks are synchronised by radio signals or Internet connections to a worldwide time system called Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is governed by master atomic clocks in many countries. A modern, atomic version of a master clock is the large clock ensemble found at the U.S. Naval Observatory.USNO Master Clock  History  In the days before the availability of highly accurate reference time many master clocks were an accurate electrically maintained pendulum clock. Thousands of such clocks were installed, in schools, offices, railway networks, telephone exchanges, and factories all over the world; they resembled a longcase clock, but had a very robust mechanism and a less ornate case. The clock timing signals, generated by electrical contacts attached to the mechanism, were minute, half minute and sometimes one second electrical pulses, fed to the controlled equipment on pairs of wires. The devices driven could be wall clocks, tower clocks, factory sirens, school bells and occasionally clock chiming mechanisms. Some types, such as the Synchronome, had optional extra mechanisms to compare the time of the clock with a standard received from the GPO time service which relayed the time signal from the Greenwich Observatory, which allowed small weights to be added or removed from the pendulum without interruption. Small weights could also be added or removed manually in the absence of this mechanism again without interruption. The British Post Office (GPO) used such master clocks in their electromechanical telephone exchanges to generate the call timing pulses necessary to charge telephone subscribers for their calls, and to control sequences of events such as the forcible clearing of connections where the calling subscriber failed to hang up after the called subscriber had done so. The UK had four such manufacturers, all of whom made clocks to the same GPO specification and which used the Hipp Toggle impulse system; these were Gent and Co., of Leicester, Magneta Ltd of Leatherhead in Surrey, Synchronome Ltd of Alperton, north-west London, and Gillett and Johnson.

She spent most of her career serving with the British, except for a brief period when she was captured by the French during the Napoleonic Wars in the Action of 24 June 1801. She fought in several of the most famous engagements of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, fighting for the British at the Battle of the Nile, and the French at the Battle of Trafalgar. Construction and commissioning Swiftsure was ordered from the yards of John & William Wells, Deptford on 19 June 1782, as an Elizabeth class ship of the line. She was laid down in May 1784 and launched on 4 April 1787. She was initially commissioned on 22 May 1787 at Deptford, and recommissioned at Woolwich on 21 August 1787. She had cost £31,241.3.5 to build, with a further £10,643 spent on fitting her out. She was coppered at Woolwich for a further £1,635. British career She was commissioned for service under her first captain, Sir James Wallace in June 1790. She sailed to Plymouth where in August she underwent another refit, for £6,456, to prepare her for service in the English Channel. After her initial period of service she was paid off in September 1791, and underwent a more significant refit for the sum of £11,413, followed by further work being carried out the next year. She returned to service and was recommissioned under Captain Charles Boyles in July 1793. Swiftsure served as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Kingsmill, and operated on the Irish Station during 1794. At the Action of 7 May 1794 Swiftsure captured the 36-gun French frigate Atalante, after a chase of 39 hours. Atalante was armed with 38 guns and had a crew of 274 men under the command of M. Charles Linois. In the action, Atalante had 10 killed and 32 wounded; British casualties were one man killed by a random shot. Swiftsure then returned to Plymouth to carry out repairs. The Royal Navy took Atalante into service as HMS Espion. Swiftsure left Britain for Jamaica on 14 May 1795. In December 1795 Swiftsure passed under the command of Captain Robert Parker, under whom she returned to Britain. She was refitted at Portsmouth the following year, before commissioning in October 1796 under Captain Arthur Phillips. He was succeeded in September 1797 by Captain John Irwin, but the following month Captain Benjamin Hallowell took command. Battle of the Nile Orient explodes at the Nile. HMS Swiftsure is in the centre of the picture, sails billowing in the blast, and riding the wave caused by the force of the explosion. Hallowell was still in command of Swiftsure in 1798, when he was ordered to join Horatio Nelson's squadron, watching the French fleet at Toulon. After the French escaped and captured Malta in June, and invaded Egypt in July, Nelson and his fleet pursued them, eventually locating them anchored in Aboukir Bay on 1 August. Swiftsure was not initially with the fleet, having been ordered by Nelson to reconnoitre Alexandria, before the French had been discovered. He arrived on the scene after dark and moved into the bay to attack. The darkness and the smoke made it difficult to tell which ship was British and which was French, so Hallowell decided to hold fire until he had anchored and prepared his ship. As he moved closer, a darkened ship was spotted standing out of the action. Hallowell determined her to be French, but decided to hold to his original plan and passed her by. The ship was in fact , which had gone up against the much larger 110-gun French first rate Orient earlier in the battle, until being dismasted and forced to drift out of the action. Hallowell took Swiftsure in, eventually anchoring across the stern of Franklin and the bow of Orient, and proceeded to open fire on them. After an hour of exchanging shots, a fire was observed in the cabin of Orient. Hallowell ordered his men to concentrate their fire on this area, while came along the opposite side and did the same. The French began to abandon ship as the fire spread, and a number were brought aboard the British ships, Swiftsure taking on Orient′s first lieutenant and ten men. Seeing that the fire was now out of control, Swiftsure and the other British ships moved away from the area, but when Orient exploded at 10pm, Swiftsure was still near enough to be struck by debris. After the destruction of the Orient, Swiftsure, in company with , continued to exchange fire with the Franklin, until she surrendered. Swiftsure then moved on to engage the Tonnant, eventually helping to drive her ashore. Swiftsure had seven killed and 22 wounded during the battle. Hallowell received a Gold Medal for his role in the battle, and Swiftsure′s first lieutenant, Thomas Cowan, was promoted to commander. After the battle Hallowell and Swiftsure took over Aboukir island on 8 August, destroying several enemy guns, and carrying the rest away. Two days later, on 10 August, Swiftsure came across and captured the 16-gun corvette Fortune. Egyptian and Italian coasts Swiftsure initially remained off Egypt as part of Samuel Hood's squadron, before departing on 14 February 1799 to join Nelson, then at Palermo. She then joined Thomas Troubridge's squadron and sailed for Naples on 31 March. They arrived on 2 April, and Hallowell landed at Procida to restore monarchist rule. The squadron then cruised off the Italian coast, and supported land based operations, helping to reduce several fortresses. On 7 August Swiftsure was dispatched to Civitavecchia to carry Hallowell to negotiate the surrender of the French garrison. Before the negotiations were complete the Swiftsure was ordered to Gibraltar, and from there to Lisbon, arriving there on 30 November. She cruised off the area with the British squadron, capturing two merchant vessels on 6 December. Whilst at sea in February 1800, Swiftsure was caught in a gale and badly damaged, having to return to Gibraltar for repairs. On returning to service with the squadron, an enemy fleet was seen on 7 April, having sailed from Cadiz bound for Lima. Two frigates and a number of merchantmen were subsequently captured. Swiftsure followed up this success on 12 April by capturing a Spanish schooner. She then became Sir Richard Bickerton's flagship during the blockade of Cadiz, before being assigned to the fleet under Lord Keith. Keith's fleet covered the landings at Aboukir on 8 March 1801, where Swiftsure′s naval brigade helped to repulse French counter-attacks. Because several of her men were wounded and others sick, Keith removed 80 of Swiftsures best men and then sent her to Malta as a convoy escort. On 8 January 1801 captured the French bombard St. Roche, which was carrying wine, liqueurs, ironware, Delfth cloth, and various other merchandise, from Marseilles to Alexandria. Swiftsure, Tigre, , , , and the schooner Malta, were in sight and shared in the proceeds of the capture. Swiftsures service in the Royal Navy's Egyptian campaign (8 March to 2 September 1801), qualified her officers and crew for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorized in 1850 to all surviving claimants. Capture On 10 June 1801 Hallowell encountered Pigmy and from her learned that a French squadron under Admiral Ganteaume had put to sea. Hallowell decided to return to reinforce Sir John Warren's squadron, but on 24 June Swiftsure encountered Ganteaume. The faster French squadron, consisting of four ships of the line and a frigate, overtook the already damaged and slow, as well as undermanned, Swiftsure. Indivisible and Dix-Août succeeded in shooting away Swiftsures yards and masts, crippling her and so forcing Hallowell to surrender. Swiftsure had two men killed, two men mortally wounded, and another six wounded; the French lost 33 killed and wounded. On his repatriation, Hallowell received the court-martial that was automatic for a Royal Navy captain who had lost his ship, but was honourably acquitted. Meanwhile, the French Navy took Swiftsure into service under her own name.Capture du Swiftsure French service In November 1802, after General de Rochambeau replaced Charles Leclerc as governor of Saint-Domingue, Rochambeau started executing blacks by drowning; he had the entire garrison of Fort Dauphin transferred to Swiftsure and thrown overboard by her crew.Herpin, p.78 Rochambeau then ordered all French ships to carry out similar executions. Only Willaumez, who was in command of the naval forces, refused, stating that \\"The officers of the French Navy are not executioners. I will not obey.\\"Merrien, p.114Les officiers de la Marine française ne sont pas des bourreaux. Je n'obéirai pas! Battle of Trafalgar The pell-mell battle. Swiftsure was one of many of the Franco-Spanish fleet to surrender, ending her brief career with the French. She only spent four years with the French, before forming part of Vice-Admiral Villeneuve's fleet at Cadiz, under her captain, Charles-Eusebe l'Hôpitalier-Villemadrin. On 21 October 1805 she sailed out with the combined Franco-Spanish fleets to engage in the Battle of Trafalgar. During the battle she formed part of the rear of the line, astern of Aigle and ahead of Argonaute. She was fired upon by , and after an exchange of fire, lost her main topmast and had her guns silenced. She began to drift away, while Colossus opened fire on Bahama. Swiftsures crew regained control, and returned to fire on Colossus, but at that moment Edward Codrington's came through the smoke, slipped under Swiftsure′s stern and discharged several devastating broadsides. Swiftsure had her mainmast, taffrail and wheel shot away, and most of the guns on the main gun-deck were dismounted. Villemadrin attempted to fight on, but eventually struck, having suffered 68 dead and 123 wounded during the battle. After the battle took her in tow. The subsequent storm caused the line to break, and by 23 October she was drifting towards Cadiz. The frigate was however able to reattach a tow line and put several of her own carpenters aboard to stop the leaks. The worsening weather again caused her to break free, but the men from Phoebe succeeded in keeping control of Swiftsure, bringing her to anchor on 26 October. took her into tow again and brought her into Gibraltar. Return to the Royal Navy Swiftsure was repaired at Gibraltar and was recommissioned in April 1806 under Captain George Digby. She sailed home, arriving at Chatham on 11 June 1806. By this time, another had already entered service, and had been present at Trafalgar. The captured Swiftsure was renamed HMS Irresistible, and was laid up. She was recommissioned in March 1808 under Captain George Fowke, and was used as a prison ship at Chatham. She served in this role until being broken up there in January 1816.

Union catalogs have been created in a range of media, including book format, microform, cards and more recently, networked electronic databases. Print union catalogs are typically arranged by title, author or subject (often employing a controlled vocabulary); electronic versions typically support keyword and Boolean queries. Union catalogs are useful to librarians, as they assist in locating and requesting materials from other libraries through interlibrary loan service. They also allow researchers to search through collections to which they would not otherwise have access, such as manuscript collections. The largest union catalog ever printed is the American National Union Catalog Pre-1956 Imprints (NUC), completed in 1981. This achievement has since been superseded by the creation of union catalogs in the form of electronic databases, of which the largest is OCLC's WorldCat.

Fakes might refer to cancellations, overprints, added or clipped perforations, stamp design alterations, etc.\\" Tom Horn, \\"Beware of Problem Areas\\", in American Philatelist vol. 118, No. 1, p. 60, January 2004 While difficult to do today, one famous case is the Stock Exchange forgery of the late 19th century. Questions are often raised about when a stamp is legitimately produced for postage. Matthew Karanian has proposed the following guideline: History of philatelic fakes and forgeries The first postage stamp was issued in Great Britain in 1840, and by the early 1860s or earlier the first postage stamp forgery Thornton Lewes & Edward Pemberton, Forged Stamps: How to Detect Them , Edinburgh, 1863 (1979 republication in Early Forged Stamps Detector, New York), pp. 7-8. \\\\- in the sense of a stamp created to fool philatelists into thinking that it is a genuine one - appeared on the market. By 1863 forgeries were so common that the book Forged Stamps: How to Detect Them was published and by 1864, forgeries were being produced of both common and scarce stamps from a wide range of issuing countries such as Austria, British Guiana, Finland, India and Spain. Jean de Sperati is among the master forgers in the history of philately. The Vancouver Island forgery refers to a stamp that was originally issued in 1865. To produce his forgery, de Sperati bleached a real, cheaper stamp of the same vintage. He then used a process called photolithography to make an almost perfect copy of the stamp. In his lifetime, Jean de Sperati forged over 500 stamps. He sometimes signed his work in pencil on the back. His forged stamps are now often worth more than the originals.\\"Postal Imposters\\" in Detecting the Truth: Fakes, Forgeries and Trickery, a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada Classification Stamp-like objects, not all of which are really fakes and forgeries, are described below for the sake of developing a better understanding of such claims. Postal forgeries or counterfeits Those who produce counterfeits appeal to a very different market from philatelists. They depend on their stamps being produced in large quantities in order to be able to recover their outlay. The person who would use them must feel that he can purchase them for a price that is significantly lower than what he would pay at a legitimate post office, or is perhaps duped into thinking they are genuine. This makes the most common current stamp used for everyday mailing a prime target for counterfeiting activity. The earliest commercial forgeries are all postal, and the Penny Black was the first stamp to be copied in 1840, its first year.Mackay, James. The Guinness Book of Stamps Facts & Feats. 1st edition. London: Guinness Superlatives Limited, 1982, p.150. Partial forgery consists of changing colors or changing the face values of stamps to imitate a higher value stamp. Other tricks consisted of methods to make the cancellation disappear (chemically erasing, placing a second stamp on it if it just hits a corner). The Spanish Post Office had to change its stamps almost annually between 1850 to 1879 to stay ahead of the forgers. Notable postal forgeries include: *France: 20c (1870), 15c (1886), sower 25c (1923) *Germany: 10pf (1902), 10pf (1909) *Great Britain: 1s (1872), 4d World Cup Winners (1966) *Australia: 2d Sydney Harbour Bridge (1932) *USA: 2c Washington (1894), 13c Liberty Bell (1980) As a curiosity postal authorities have published their own forgeries, thus the British Post Office forged its own 1d stamps in 1856 to see if its features were fraud-proof. Protective measures Postal services developed, early on, measures to protect the integrity of their stamps. Some of these steps are similar to those used to protect against forged currency. Major steps include: * Watermarks * Special paper * Delicate engraving * Printing methods * Special ink for postmarks * Insertion of silk threads * Secret marks either visible or invisible to the microscope * Re- issue of stamps It may not be possible to distinguish between a philatelic and postal forgery if the stamps are unused, merely by looking at them; the techniques utilized in producing them are identical. However, if the stamps bear cancellations, they may be more readily distinguished. If a stamp has a forged cancellation, it necessarily is a philatelic forgery since it was obviously made for sale to collectors, not to be used to send a letter.See, e.g., James M. Chemi, The Yucatan Affair - The Work of Raoul C. De Thuin, Philatelic Counterfeiter (2d ed. American Philatelic Society, State College, PA 1980) p. 149. If the cancellation is genuine, it is likely, but not necessarily, a postal forgery, since sometimes forgers have used genuine cancellation devices to \\"cancel\\" forged stamps.See, e.g., Roberto Liera Gutiérrez, Characterísticas de Algunas Falsificaciones de Timbres de México p. 10 (Mexico sold genuine cancellation devices which were later used on forgeries). A helpful distinction may be to have one of these stamps on an envelope that actually went through the mail, but that too requires caution. Counterfeits that reach the philatelic community are fairly scarce, and that alone makes them more valuable. Philatelic forgeries Soon after their introduction, stamps became philatelic objects, and stamp forgery to the detriment of the collector became a problem. The first book about the topic was written by Jean-Baptiste Moens from Belgium De la falsifications des timbres-poste in 1862. Shortly thereafter Pemberton published Forged Stamps: How to detect them and Robert Brisco Earée Album Weeds. Stamps produced by famous forgers have become collectibles, as well. Unlike counterfeits these are very common in collections. Many that were produced in the earliest days of stamp collecting in the 19th century are still plentiful. At that time many considered it quite acceptable to fill a space in an album with a facsimile when the genuine stamp was unavailable. Later, especially in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, massive numbers of stamps were forged for the packet trade, including very common as well as rare stamps, so that the fact that a stamp is common is no guarantee that it is not a philatelic forgery. Fakes Fakes begin with a genuine stamp, which is altered in some way to make it more valuable to stamp collectors. When catalogues show different varieties with significantly different values this can be great motivation to alter the cheap example into something that can be sold for great profit. Sometimes only minor changes can affect the apparent valuation of a stamp. Knowledge is an important tool in helping to detect fakes and forgeries. A person who is able to identify some of the most obvious forgeries can save a lot of money in expertising fees, though the information may not yet be enough to establish that a stamp is genuine. Earee's Album Weeds, and Serrane's Vade Mecum are only two books in the vast literature about stamp forgeries. Expertising stamps as protection As an expert can falsify stamps often quite easily, it is advisable particularly when dealing with stamps of value to have them examined and expertised. Such experts are highly specialized and generally focused on a selected philatelic area. Falsified stamps may be marked as such, while a genuine stamp of value should receive a certificate of authenticity by a reputable authority. In recent years, homemade forgeries can easily reach the market through the internet.Examples retrieved 04-12-2008 Government and propaganda forgeries Political and propaganda forgery is produced by countries in conflict to hurt the opponent. Stamps may be issued to deprive the enemy of revenue, to distribute propaganda material, to cause confusion, and to depict propaganda messages. Propaganda stamps are very collectable and have been philatelically forged: a forgery of a forgery. Many propaganda stamps would have been difficult to circulate in the postal system because they would have been immediately removed, thus used propaganda stamps are unusual (but easily falsified).  World War I  War mail forgery Ludwig III. (left). On the right the original Propaganda forgery Deutsch-Ostafrika Probes of the British „Germania“-forgery, connected to 10 and 15 pfennigs \\"Germania\\"-forgery, 15 Pf. in correct colour During the First World War, German postage stamps were forged by Great Britain. Virtually all counterfeit stamps are forgeries for espionage. The values of 5, 10 and 15 pfennigs of the then Bavarian postage stamp issue with the portrait of Ludwig III fell victim to war mail forgeries. However, only unused pieces are known. Imperforated proofs were also discovered among these forgeries. The war fakes differ in drawing and paper from the original stamps. The second German postage stamp issue was forged by Great Britain on behalf of the Dutch Propaganda Office. It was used to frank leaflets and brochures in German language. Affected are the postage stamp values of 10 and 15 pfennigs of the Germania edition of the German Reich. The drawing deviates from the originals, as does the watermark, which is too thin, and the chalky white paper. Unlike the previous war mail forgeries, there are also pieces with real postmarks from both forged stamps. There is also known a type of propaganda forgery, which was produced between 1914 and 1918. Forgeries of German East Africa stamps were produced, which showed the imprint \\"G. E. A. BRITISH OCCUPATION\\" and a new value in Cents. The five forged issues were about twice the size of the original stamps, presumably to show the overprint in larger letters. The stamps were apparently intended to put the massive German resistance in the colony of Deutsch-Ostafrika into perspective and to propagate an early occupation of the whole area. On December 12, 1914, two Germania stamps were reproduced in the French newspaper \\"Le Matin\\". A red 10 pfennig stamp bore the imprint \\"Schweiz 10 Centimes\\", a blue 20 pfennig stamp the imprint \\"Schweiz 25 Centimes\\". The article stated that there are more Germania stamps with various other values. This was obviously intended to give the impression that neutral Switzerland was on the verge of being occupied by Germany. The German embassy in Bern felt compelled to deny the article and accuse the newspaper of having fallen for a forgery, which, according to subsequent evidence, was without doubt the case. Shortly before the end of World War I, war mail forgeries of the values of 5, 10 and 25 Hellers of the then current postage stamp issue of Austria were produced in England. The stamps show the Austrian imperial crown and Emperor Karl. The fake postage stamps were printed on slightly more yellowish paper than the originals. Furthermore, the stamp images of the forgeries are slightly higher (¼ - ½ mm). Used war mail forgeries have not yet been found; however, there are mint pieces of all three values as well as proofs of the 10-Hellers value in small sheet format in three different colours with the date September 25, 1918.  World War II  = German forgeries for the United Kingdom = Propaganda stamp with the head of King George VI. Version with red overprint: \\"Liquidation of Empire/BAHAMA-Is\\". Additionally with false cancellation: \\"LONDON AAAO/-6JUN/44/SPECIAL-STAMP\\". All known German falsifications are propaganda forgeries.Gustav Schenk. The Romance of the Postage Stamp. Doubleday & C0, Garden City, NY (1959), p183ff Forgeries of the Silver Jubilee issue of 1935 were falsified at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp by order of Heinrich Himmler during the war. The modifications included the insertion of Jewish and communist emblems, placement of Joseph Stalin's head in place of King George's, the inscription that was faulty (\\"This war is a Jewsh war\\" [sic]) and the years altered to 1939-1944. A similar falsification concerned the coronation issue from 1937 in which Stalin's head appears in the place of the Queen's, the star of David is present, as well as an inscription concerning the Tehran conference. A third forgery is different and affects the 1937 series with the head of King George VI. The alterations are very subtle affecting emblems. Six values of the series were falsified. In the short film \\"Adolph Burger's Historical Artifacts\\" Sachsenhausen survivor Burger shows examples of some of these stamps that he helped produce. He also describes this in greater detail in his book The Devil's Workshop. = United States forgeries for Germany = American propaganda stamp The first stamps to be forged were the common 6 and 12 pfennig Hitler head stamps. The forgeries were printed in Rome by the Office of Strategic Services in 1944. These stamps were applied to letters containing propaganda, marked with false postmarks (Wien 8, Wien 40, Hannover 1), and distributed by drops from airplanes as Operation Cornflakes. The US modified the 12 pfennig Hitler head stamp by the insertion of a death head and the inscription Futsches Reich (\\"ruined Reich\\") replaces Deutsches Reich. Similarly, the Hitler block from 1937 was altered to show a death head, graves, and gallows; the inscription is Deutsches Reich 1944. Postcards were also forged. = Soviet forgeries for Germany = Soviet forgeries were limited to postcards with propaganda messages that had imprinted stamps. = British forgeries = Great Britain produced forgeries for Germany, France, Italy, Poland (Generalgouvernement), and French Morocco during World War II. Regarding Germany, the first forgery was the 12 pfennig Hindenburg head stamp, later followed by the 3, 4, 6, and 8 pfennig values, to distribute propaganda material in Germany. Other stamps such as the Hitler heads and some field post stamps may not have reached circulation. A major effort was the production of propaganda stamps. The Hitler head stamp was modified to depict Heinrich Himmler. Himmler-Forgery (Type I top, Type II bottom) Probes of the Himmler- Forgery Type II in black and violet Cancelled Himmler stamps forged by PWE on a postcard. The Himmler stamp was designed by the British secret service with the intention of driving a wedge between the leadership of the Nazi regime. With the idea that Himmler was planning a coup d'état and wanted to make himself a new leader or president of Germany, an allegedly prepared stamp issue with his portrait was considered suitable to bring this idea into the minds of the NS leadership in the first place. The stamp was distributed by British agents, especially in neutral Switzerland. It was hoped that stamp collectors became aware of this stamp and that a major press campaign would subsequently take place about it. It turned out, however, that this forgery did not attract a lot of attention, neither in Switzerland nor in the rest of Europe. In the end, the British agents were forced to take the Himmler stamp directly to stamp dealers to make it public. However, even this measure did not lead to the desired success and the action turned out to be a complete failure, as practically nobody believed in the alleged Himmler overthrow. What was curious, however, was that a member of the US secret service OSS in Bern, of all people, ascribed extraordinary significance to this stamp. On June, 10 1944, US agent Allan Dulles prepared a detailed report for his superior in Washington in which he described the mysterious stamp. As the US side amazingly had not been informed about the counterfeiting operation by the British secret service, the US secret service started superfluous investigations and thus tied up personnel, which finally turned the whole operation into an embarrassing mishap. The Jewish concentration camp inmate Adolf Burger, who had participated in Operation Bernhard, commented after the war that Heinrich Himmler was very indignant about this British forgery with his portrait. This apparently prompted him to repay with the same coin and also to commission mocking propaganda stamps on the British side. There are two distinctly different versions of the Himmler stamp, one with wide lines, a second type with narrow lines; there are imperforated proofs of the second type in both violet and black, and of the first type in violet. No genuine cancellations have yet been found; all known specimens are clearly forgeries to the collectors' detriment. However, some postcards and envelopes were made by the British secret service PWE, which were prepared with attached Himmler stamps and faked German cancellations. These were intended for neutral countries such as Switzerland, Sweden or probably also Portugal to be distributed there by agents. Some of these postal items have been preserved. Another propaganda forgery concerns the 1943 Hitler putsch stamp that shows General Witzleben (a participant in the July 20, 1944 Hitler assassination attempt) and is inscribed Gehängt am 8. August 1944 (\\"Hanged on...\\") Other forgeries were based on the welfare stamps from 1938, and the 1944 Hitler putsch stamp. Regarding France, Britain produced forgeries of the Iris series and of stamps depicting Marshal Philippe Pétain. Emanuel-forgery Propaganda forgery of Michel Nr. 625 (Italy) (top), the original stamp is at the bottom Propaganda forgery of Michel Nr. 626 (Italy) (top), the original stamp is at the bottom Propaganda forgeries were also produced for Italy, which was allied with Germany in the Second World War. Thus the design of Michel No. 625 (Italy) was changed by disfiguring the heads of Hitler respectively Mussolini in a caricature-like manner, so that the impression was created to contrast an \\"aggressive and grim\\" looking Hitler with a \\"baffled and intimidated\\" looking Mussolini. The Italian text was changed from (translated) \\"Two peoples, one war\\" to \\"Two peoples, one Führer\\", with the word Führer written in German. Also, in the right-hand \\"Italian part\\", the cutting and stabbing weapons were depicted heavily worn or damaged. In the left \\"German part\\" the sword hilt received the small caricature of a head or face. More subtle was the characterization of German dominance over Italy in the propaganda forgery Michel No. 626 (Italy), 50 Centesimi. The stamp, which was originally issued in a violet shade, was printed in green. The text was changed from \\"Poste Italiane\\" to \\"Two Peoples/One War\\". Both forgeries were probably produced in autumn 1943. The British Political Warfare Executive (PWE) also produced two propaganda booklets in Italian on which the Italian stamps are depicted. On one of the booklets Michel No. 626 (Italy) is shown, but in blue coloring instead of a violet tone. Probably already at the beginning of 1943 the PWE also produced a war forgery of the Italian stamp with the image of King Victor Emanuel III. It is assumed that this was intended to be used to frank the propaganda booklets \\"Neapolitan letters\\" from 1943. Both perforated and imperforated specimens of this stamp exist. The forgery differed from the original mainly by the perforation (14 ¾ : 14) instead of 14. Stamps were produced in Great Britain for the Generalgouvernement and used by the Polish underground army to distribute propaganda material. The Hitler head stamp of the Generalgouvernement was modified to depict Hans Frank on the 20 groszy value. These stamps circulated in the postal system. French-controlled Morocco received stamps forged by the British authorities that had overprints of Deutsche Reichspost in Marokko to create confusion and suggest an imminent German occupation. Few examples are known. Inserted letter «A» on a 1 penny stamp The propaganda forgeries of two stamps of the Channel Island Jersey may be regarded as a curiosity. Jersey, like the other Channel Islands, was occupied by the German Wehrmacht from 1940 to 1945. The British designer and engraver N.V.L. Rybot was commissioned by the German administration to design and print Jersey stamps. Apparently to his personal satisfaction, he engraved the very small and inconspicuous letters \\"AABB\\" and \\"AAAA\\" in the four corners of the ½ as well as of the 1 penny stamps. After the war, Rybot explained that he had inserted the secret letters in order to strengthen the fighting spirit of the British, who were informed about the forgery. According to his statement, the letters \\"AABB\\" were to represent an abbreviation for the words \\"Adolphe Atrox\\" and \\"Bloody Benito\\", Latin for \\"Cruel Adolf\\" and English for \\"Bloody Benito\\" respectively. Furthermore, the letters \\"AAAA\\" had the abbreviated meaning \\"Ad Avernum, Adolphe Atrox\\", Latin for \\"To hell, cruel Adolf\\".  Cold war: West Berlin for the GDR  Between 1948 and 1954 a group founded by Werner Hildebrandt produced anti-communist propaganda including stamps that were used in the postal system of East Germany (GDR). The first stamps to be modified were the 12 and 24 pfennig values of the series depicting the President of the GDR Wilhelm Pieck. The propaganda versions showed a noose and the inscription Undeutsche Undemokratische Diktatur (\\"un-German un-democratic dictatorship\\"). Other changes were made to the stamps of the Five Year Plan. The group also modified production instructions to factories that caused economic damage. Other types Official reprints Official reprints of stamps that are no longer valid for postage are usually produced by governments to meet a philatelic demand. Scott numbers 3 and 4 of the United States were produced for this purpose. This also happened with several early sets of the People's Republic of China. Remainders Remainders are surplus stocks of legitimate postage stamps that are put on the philatelic market after ceasing to be valid for postal purposes. Among these are the later stamps of Nova Scotia, before it became a province of Canada, and the German inflationary period stamps. One effect of distributing large quantities of remaindered stamps to the public is that used stamps can be much more valuable than mint ones. Bogus stamps Bogus stamps are fictitious stamps which purport to be produced by an entity that exists and might have produced them, but did not. A bogus stamp is not a forgery because it is not based on any genuine stamp. It does not even resemble anything that the entity did produce, and only rarely are any of these labels ever shipped to the place that is shown as issuing them. The term also refers to a genuine stamp which bears the sham addition of an unauthorized surcharge or overprint.Bennett, Russell and Watson, James; Philatelic Terms Illustrated, Stanley Gibbons Publications, London (1978). They are generally issued to deceive collectors. Among these are the \\"issues\\" for South Moluccas when Henry Stolow printed the Maluku Selatan stamps, and for the uninhabited Scottish island of Staffa. The 1923 famine relief stamps of Azerbaijan were bogus, but these too were also subsequently forged.L. N. and M. Williams, Cinderella Stamps, London, Heinemann, 1970, p. 81. Fantasies Fantasies are stamps claimed to be issued by places that do not even exist. One of the most famous of these were \\"King\\" Charles-Marie David de Mayréna's stamps for Sedang.Williams (1970), p. 2. The stamps of New Atlantis required the construction of a bamboo raft that would be floated in the Atlantic as the country.Williams (1970), p. 109. Hitler-fantasy: a genuine stamp on top and a fake stamp at the bottom In exceptional cases, even fantasies can be highly traded in collector circles. Fantasy stamps from 1978, which were produced in Great Britain, represent an exceptional case. In that year the British author Len Deighton published a book entitled SS-GB. The story is about a Britain that was occupied by Nazi Germany during the Second World War. In this context, a stamp with Hitler's head and the inscription \\"Postage Revenue\\", as found on all British stamps, appeared on the front page of the book. As a clever marketing strategy for the introduction of the book, a booklet of stamps was produced, which contained the alleged Hitler stamps with three different values and in three different colours of six stamps each. However, the British Post Office was not at all amused and confiscated all the booklets it could get its hands on as rapidly as possible. The remaining booklets quickly became a rarity sought after by collectors. At an auction in England, for example, a booklet was sold for 300 British pounds. In Germany, in 1998, one of them realized the proud price of 1250 DM. So it was not long before counterfeiters came up with the idea of forging even these booklets with fantasy stamps themselves. These imitations also brought in several hundred dollars on the US market. Local stamps Local stamps are usually intended to serve a local purpose, and are not necessarily fraudulent. Thus we have in relation to the Great Britain: \\"... there were two local entities that 'performed much in the way of postal service ... Herm and Lundy.' Those two, it would seem, are considered thoroughly legitimate.\\" Richard M. Langworth, \\"Herm and Its Locals\\", American Philatelist, Vol. 95., No. 11, Nov. 1981, p. 1009 These islands did not have official post offices, and a private service needed to be established to transport mail to the mainland. Cinderellas Cinderellas is a broad term for just about anything that looks like a postage stamp but isn't. While the term includes bogus stamps and fantasies, it also includes many fund raising labels, Christmas seals, and other stickers that were produced for legitimate purposes. Methods Entire forgeries This is the most obvious way of producing forgeries. The forger starts from scratch, and engraves a completely new plate. It is virtually impossible to produce a new engraving that will be identical to the original. Thus, in the earliest set of Hong Kong stamps the forgeries can be distinguished by counting the number of shading lines in the background. Some early Japanese forgeries are distinguished by remembering that the chrysanthemum crest in the stamp should always have 16 petals. Modern electronic techniques would appear to make things easier for the forger, but understanding how different printing methods work can be very helpful in discovering these forgeries. Recently Peter Winter from Germany used modern technology to produce convincing reproductions which were then unscrupulously sold as genuine. Forged overprints Forged overprints on 1913 New Zealand stamps. Forged overprint on 1899 Puerto Principe, Cuba, provisional stamp alongside a genuine surcharge. While the relative spacings of the three elements of the surcharge are roughly the same as on the genuine stamp, note, however, the differences in the crossbar on the \\"t\\" and the cap of the \\"5\\", together with the crispness of the lettering. One would imagine that overprints should be easier for a forger to falsify. It is just a simple matter of applying a few letters to a stamp with black ink. Paying attention to detail can reward a philatelic sleuth. The stamps of Bangkok from the 1880s were produced by overprinting each stamp a single letter \\"B\\" on stamps of the Straits Settlements. Some of these overprints are bogus because they are on underlying stamps that were never known to have been issued with that overprint. Forgeries can be discovered by examining the relative heights of the two loops of the B.Robson Lowe, The Encyclopædia of British Empire Postage Stamps, 1775-1950, London, Robson Lowe Ltd., 1951, pp. 380-1 Another example, from New Zealand, is four stamps overprinted for an industrial exhibition held in Auckland in 1913. The accompanying image shows genuine overprints, and forged overprints from an internet auction. A New Zealand dealer prices a set of postally used stamps with genuine overprints at NZD 1600, while the same four stamps, postally used without the overprint, are priced at NZD 8. This indicates the potentially lucrative payoff for forgers. In another example the 1948 Gandhi stamps of India were overprinted with the single word \\"SERVICE\\" to produce a stamp for official government use. The key to knowing the difference between the two is based on recognizing the difference between a typographed and a lithographed overprint. The former will leave an impression in the paper which can be detected by looking at the back of the stamp. Reperforating For many years, sheets of stamps were generally cut into four quarters (panes) before being perforated. This produced many stamps that were perforated on only three sides. On a pane of 100, for example, 18 stamps appeared with a single straight edge, the single (corner) stamp lacked perforations on two sides, and only 81 stamps were perforated on all four sides. (A pane of 50 commemorative-sized stamps typically contained only 36 fully perforated copies.) Because stamps with a straight edge are less desirable to collectors—and fetch lower prices—than fully perforated examples, unscrupulous dealers have “reperforated” many older straight-edged stamps: that is, they have carefully cut false perforations into the flat side, so that the copy can be sold for the same price as a normally perforated version. In other cases a valuable and a common variety of a stamp may differ only by the presence or size of the perforations. Thus new perforations are cut into the stamp, or perforations are cut off to make a common stamp appear like a rare imperforate or rare coil issue. Repairs In some cases the value of a damaged stamp can be enhanced by repairing the damage. Colour changes The colour of a stamp can be changed by exposing the stamp to various chemicals, or by leaving it out in bright sunlight. Carefully applied chemicals can also be used to remove specific colours to produce \\"rare\\" missing colour varieties. False postmarks A postal card canceled on \\"8 April 1885\\". This was thought to be a genuine (and quite valuable) used card until a noted collector of Puerto Rican postal stationery noticed that he had other cards postmarked Mayagüez and addressed to the same recipient who lived in Mayagüez, who he knew to be a representative of the Senf brothers, stamp dealers in Leipzig, Germany. The other cards were dated 8 April 1887 (for the 1887 card), and 8 April 1893 (for the 1893 card). This led him to the conclusion that the recipient addressed them to himself and had a sympathetic or complicit postal clerk fraudulently back date the year to match the card's date of origin. He probably then sent the uncirculated, but postmarked, cards to the Senf brothers who sold them to collectors.Mitchell, Byron, editor of the Puerto Rico section of Postal Cards of Spanish Colonial Cuba, Philippines and Puerto Rico, Robert Littrell, editor, UPSS (2010) There are many instances of stamps that have been produced in large quantities, but where comparatively very small numbers have done postage service. Huge quantities of mint stamps can be left over after a bout of inflation, a political overthrow or loss of a war. In some cases a genuine stamp can have a fake cancellation applied to make it appear to be a rare, and valuable postally used example. A notable example is the 90¢ U. S. stamp of 1860, withdrawn within a year, on which a genuine cancellation raises the Scott Catalogue value from US $3000 to $11,000. Scott's listing includes the caveat: \\"All used examples … must be accompanied by certificates of authenticity issued by recognized expertizing committees.\\" It is also important to know that not all cancellations are postal. Some countries have inscribed their stamps \\"Postage and Revenue\\". Some very high face values on such stamps could not reasonably have been used for postage, thus making any kind of proper postal usage exceedingly rare. More commonly these high face values were for fiscal usages to indicate the payment of taxes on real estate or corporate shares. While such cancellations are not fakes, they can easily be misrepresented to the unwary as the more valuable postal cancellations. Rainer Blüm was sentenced recently in a high-profile German legal case for forgery of postmarks to increase the value of stamps.  Cancelled-to-order (CTO)  Technically CTOs are not fakes since they have been cancelled by the stamp issuing authority. Many of these are easily identified because while they have been postmarked they still retain their original gum. Some postal authorities cancel them and sell them at a considerable discount to the philatelic community. The authorities can do that profitably because they no longer need to provide the postal services that the stamps were meant to pay for. Many collectors are more interested in stamps that have been correctly used, and the corresponding used stamp may often be worth more than a mint stamp. Authorities who do this tend to use the same canceller for all CTOs, and apply it very neatly in the corner of four stamps at one time.

Biography Born in London and raised in Quebec, Charest returned to the UK to attend the London International Film School. In 1976, she traveled to New Orleans where she met her future husband, New Yorker and Tulane graduate Ronald A. Weinberg. While in New Orleans, Charest and Weinberg organized an event for a women's film festival, and worked at distributing foreign films to US theatres. The couple moved to New York and formed Cinar, then a budding film and television distribution company. In 1984, Charest and Weinberg changed their focus from media distribution to production, and moved the business to Montreal, where they concentrated on children's television programming because of the favorable tax situation for development and distribution of TV shows. During this time, Charest served as either producer or executive producer for dozens of popular animated series for children, including The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Animal Crackers, Emily of New Moon, Mona the Vampire, and The Wombles. As a production company, Cinar was also involved in the work of Are You Afraid of the Dark?, The Busy World of Richard Scarry, Madeline, Space Cases, Zoboomafoo, Caillou, and Arthur. By 1999, Cinar boasted annual revenues of $150 million (CAD) and owned about $1.5 billion (CAD) of the children's television market. The company had become known for quality, non-violent children's programs broadcast in more than 150 countries and was one of the founding partners in the Canadian cable television channel TELETOON. Scandal The success of Charest, Weinberg, and Cinar ended in March 2001, when an internal audit revealed that about $122 million (US) was invested into Bahamian bank accounts without the boardmembers' approval.Swift, Michael. Cinar had also paid American screenwriters for work while continuing to accept Government of Canada grants for content. The names of Canadians, most notably Micheline Charest's sister, Helene via the alias 'Eric Alexandre'(Eric and Alex Weinberg are the names of Charest Weinberg's sons), were credited for the work, allowing Cinar to benefit from Canadian tax credits. While the province of Quebec did not file criminal charges, Cinar denied any wrongdoing, choosing instead to pay a settlement to Canadian and Quebec tax authorities of $17.8 million (CAD) and another $2.6 million (CAD) to Telefilm Canada, a Canadian federal funding agency. The value of Cinar stock plummeted, and the company was soon delisted. In 2001, as part of a settlement agreement with the Commission des Valeurs Mobilières du Québec (Quebec Securities Commission) Charest and Weinberg agreed to pay $1 million each and were banned from serving in the capacity of directors or officers at any publicly traded Canadian company for five years. There was no admission of guilt and none of the allegations have been proven in court. In March 2004, Cinar was purchased for more than $140 million (US) by a group led by Nelvana co-founder, Michael Hirsh. Charest and Weinberg reportedly received $18 million (US) for their company shares. In August 2009 Claude Robinson, a graphic artist and writer, won a copyright case against Cinar, Weinberg, Charest and Co. in relation to his work, Robinson Curiosité, which was plagiarized for the internationally successful animated series Robinson Sucroë. Personal life Charest and Weinberg had two children together, Eric and Alex. Death and legacy Charest died on April 14, 2004, due to complications ensued after elective plastic surgery. Charest was ranked 19th in The Hollywood Reporter's 1997 list of the 50 most powerful women in the entertainment industry.

As a Guggenheim engineer, he was the first to apply scientific methods to sampling bulk- tonnage orebodies at the enormous porphyry copper deposit at Bingham Canyon, Utah. Krumb further refined his churn drill sampling technique at William Boyce Thompson's Inspiration (Miami, Arizona) mine. He also developed the nearby Magma Mine at Superior, Arizona for Thompson. Thompson then built a winter home and gardens nearby, now open to the public as the Boyce Thompson Arboretum, the oldest public botanical garden in the Western US.

However, in 1998, Columbia did away with its mining program and the Krumb chair in mining has been vacant for at least two decades, as of 2013. The lecture series at Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration is also named in his honor. Krumb graduated from Columbia School of Mines with a E.M. degree in 1898.

Of this area, 52.6% is used for agricultural purposes, while 26.9% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 20.2% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (0.3%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains). housing and buildings made up 14.9% of the total area, while transportation infrastructure made up the rest (5.5%). Of the total unproductive area, water (streams and lakes) made up 0% of the area. 17% of the total municipal area was undergoing some type of construction. The municipality is located on the south-west shore of the Greifensee. It includes the village of Maur and the settlements of Aesch, Scheuren (Forch), Binz, Ebmatingen and Uessikon. Economy In the Powerplay studio, almost all the important Swiss musicians and many international bands produced and recorded their hit albums, including the Bee Gees, Europe (including the song The Final Countdown), Lady Gaga, Lenny Kravitz, Prince, Snoop Dogg, Udo Jürgens and Wu- Tang Clan. For a long time, the village was cut off from the major traffic routes. Without railways and without water-rich streams, no industry could gain a foothold in the municipality. Even today, agriculture is still an important employer, along with a few small service and craft businesses. Four- fifths of the working population earn their living outside the municipality, mostly in the city of Zurich and the surrounding towns.

Formerly part of the Rothwell Urban District, it is now within the Rothwell ward of Leeds City Council. The village sits on the banks of the Aire and Calder Navigation and river system. History The name was first recorded between 1188 and 1202, in the form Widlesford, with other medieval forms including Wryd(e)lesford(e). These other forms are closer to the likely origin: Old English *wrīdels 'thicket' + ford 'ford'. The ford was on a bend in the River Aire close to the present day Woodlesford lock on the Aire and Calder Navigation. Much of Woodlesford's expansion took place in the nineteenth century as a mining and stone quarrying village. The closest pit to the centre of the village was sunk to the Beeston seam in the 1870s but was only operational for a few years. Many of the miners employed there then moved to work at pits owned by T & R W Bower Ltd on the opposite side of the river on the Lowther estate at Swillington. Miners living in Woodlesford also worked at the Rothwell pits owned by J & J Charlesworth. There was a big influx in population in 1911 when Henry Briggs, Son & Company Ltd sunk two shafts to the Beeston and Silkstone seam at Water Haigh. That pit stayed in production until 1970 when many from its workforce were made redundant or were dispersed to other collieries in the area and further afield on the Selby coalfield. When coal production ceased at Rothwell in 1983 the area declined but has recovered in large part due to its proximity to the centre of Leeds with housing for commuters. The village was the home of Bentley's Yorkshire Bitter but after the brewery was acquired by Whitbread plc in 1968 beer production ceased in 1972. The brewery premises served as a distribution centre until 1983. The Bentley family started the brewery in 1828. They also built Eshald Mansion and were major benefactors of All Saints Church. The church opened in 1879 and closed in the 1990s. It has since been redeveloped as a house and Eshald Mansion divided into flats. Originally Woodlesford was separated from the neighbouring village of Oulton but this is no longer the case due to the residential expansion of both villages. The official boundary between the two villages runs through the centre of the Midland Hotel public house, along Midland Street and then across to Holmsley Field Lane. This placed the now closed Oulton Library in Woodlesford. The Woodlesford postal district also extended as far as the now disappeared mining village of Bowers Row on the Swillington side of the river. Community Woodlesford is now a residential part of the commuter belt that services the city of Leeds. It once had a number of industries, including its own pottery, match factory, quarries, and a brewery. It was divided into two parts \\"Old Woodlesford\\" and \\"New Woodlesford\\". The old part of the village is situated to the north of a park on the hill and contains the school, the chapel and former church. New Woodlesford related to houses on Midland Street and the area on Aberford Road which is now dominated by 19th-century terraces, a Co-op store and a butcher's. At the centre of the village is a small park which contains a football pitch, children's play area and skatepark. The closest sports facility is Rothwell Sports Centre in neighbouring Oulton. Woodlesford has two public houses and there are other pubs and restaurants in the nearby area. In 2010 the White Hart on Church Street closed to the public and was demolished. It had been Woodlesford's largest pub. The village contains a post office, a convenience store, a newsagent and other shops and food outlets. Some people in the area travel to Leeds or Wakefield for recreation. The village has its own Army Cadet Force unit (part of Yorkshire North & West ACF) which is based on Oulton Lane near the playing field/skate park. Transport Woodlesford railway station to the north-east of the village provides trains to Leeds, Barnsley, Sheffield and Goole from which services link to major cities throughout the country. The station operates 7 days a week, with services on the Hallam Line (Leeds to Sheffield); and the Pontefract Line (Leeds to Knottingley, with limited services continuing to Goole). The service connects to Leeds City Centre, with a journey time of 8 minutes. Other services connect the village to Castleford, Normanton, Glasshoughton, Pontefract Monkhill, Knottingley, Wakefield Kirkgate, Darton, Barnsley, Wombwell, Elsecar, Chapeltown, Meadowhall Interchange and Sheffield. In the summer the Scarborough Spa Express train operates services to Scarborough on alternative Thursdays, calling at Woodlesford railway station. Passengers spend three to four hours at Scarborough before the return journey. The service is diesel powered to York and steam powered from York to Scarborough. Major roads are situated nearby including the M1, M62, A1 and an M1/A1 link road. Education Most primary age children in the area attend Woodlesford Primary School. The school was opened as a \\"board school\\" in 1879. In 2004 Woodlesford Primary School was 24th overall in the Leeds area primary school rankings.\\"Primary schools in Leeds\\", BBC News.

It is a 2-story brick and stone house, originally constructed by the English, Quaker settler, Thomas Massey in 1696. It is located on Lawrence Road near Sproul Road in Broomall, Pennsylvania.  Thomas Massey  Thomas Massey was born in the village of Marpoole (Marple) in Cheshire, England. He was a Quaker and an indentured servant to Francis Stanfield, who arranged for him and seven other indentured servants to emigrate to America. Thomas set sail from Chester, England aboard the ketch \\"Endeavor\\". He landed in Philadelphia, PA on September 29, 1683 at the age of twenty. After Thomas worked off his indenture, he received of land from his master and another 50 acres from William Penn. In 1692, at age 29, Thomas married 22-year-old, Phebe Taylor, whom he had met aboard the Endeavor. Together they had seven children: Esther (1693), Mordecai (1695), James (1697), Hannah (1699), Thomas (1701), Phoebe (1705) and Mary (1707). Thomas Massey died in 1707/08 and Phebe remarried two years later.Thomas Massey House official site Note: This includes Their oldest son, Mordecai inherited the house and it remained in the Massey family until 1925.  Building history  Thomas Massey built the original brick section in 1696 as an addition to an earlier wooden house. Thomas's son Mordecai Massey likely tore down the wooden house and built the first stone addition during the 1730s. A stone walled kitchen was added in the early nineteenth century with a second story above the kitchen added about 1860. The house remained in the Massey family until 1925, and was used as a farmhouse into the 1930s when a furnace and electrical wiring were added. When the land around the house was developed into suburban housing, the Massey House was used for storage and painting. In 1964, the house was saved from demolition by Massey's descendant, Lawrence M.C. Smith. Smith bought the house and of ground and donated the property to Marple Township on condition that it be restored within ten years. The restoration was completed by architect, John Milner. During the restoration, a walk-in- fireplace and beehive oven were uncovered. Many of the home's original features have been restored and are fully functional. The house was placed on the National Register of Historical Places in 1970 and is listed on the Historic American Buildings Survey. A Pennsylvania historical marker was dedicated on the site on May 9, 1986.  Tours and events  The house is open to the public for tours from April through October on Sundays from 1 to 4 PM. It is seasonally decorated and furnished with authentic 17th and 18th century items, including some of the home's original fixtures, such as: cabinetry, furniture, cookware and dinnerware, books and tools. Special events such as: lectures, demonstrations, dinners, cooking classes, gardening presentations and social gatherings are held throughout the year. At dinner events, an authentic colonial meal is prepared in the kitchen and served in the home.

She began her professional career performing mostly minor roles from the mezzo-soprano repertoire in 1929 but later switched to singing primarily leading soprano roles in 1937 until her retirement from the opera stage in 1963. She notably had a lengthy and fruitful partnership with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, singing there for eighteen consecutive seasons between 1932 and 1950. Her greatest successes were from the dramatic soprano repertoire, particularly in operas by Richard Wagner. Not a stranger to the concert repertoire, Bampton was particularly known for her performances of works by Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg, and her friend Samuel Barber, notably having performed their compositions with the composers accompanying her in concert. Early life and career: 1907-1932 Born in Lakewood, Ohio, Bampton grew up in Buffalo, New York. She entered Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa], where she initially began training as a soprano, but was redirected by her voice teacher into the mezzo-soprano repertoire after a serious bout of laryngitis. Shortly after graduating with a bachelor's degree, Bampton made her professional opera debut as Siebel in Gounod's Faust at the Chautauqua Opera in 1929. Her performance was positively received and she was invited to perform at the Worcester Music Festival in Worcester, Massachusetts that summer. In the fall of 1929 Bampton moved to Philadelphia after being offered a contract to join the roster of singers of the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company (PGOC) where she sang mostly comprimario roles over the next three years. Bampton made her PGOC debut as Mercédès in Georges Bizet's Carmen on October 23, 1929 with a cast that included Sophie Braslau as Carmen, Ralph Errolle as Don José, Chief Caupolican as Escamillo, and Henri Elkan conducting. Other roles with the company included Mistress Bentson in Lakmé (1929), Feodor in Boris Godunov with Georges Baklanoff in the title role (1929), Mama Lucia in Cavalleria rusticana (1929, 1931), Alisa in Lucia di Lammermoor (1930), the shepherd boy in Tosca (1930, 1932), Myrtale in Thaïs (1930, 1932), the first maid in Elektra with Charlotte Boerner as Chrysothemis (1931, 1932), Brangäne in Tristan und Isolde with Paul Althouse as Tristan (1932), Wellgunde in both Das Rheingold and Götterdämmerung (1932), and Waltraute in Die Walküre (1932).Free Library of Philadelphia: Bound: Phila. Grand Opera Company : Programme: 782.1 P532p 1929/30 - 1933/34 While performing at the PGOC, Bampton entered the Curtis Institute of Music in 1930 to pursue graduate studies in singing where her voice teachers included Horatio Connell and Queena Mario. She also had the opportunity to attend masterclasses given by Lotte Lehmann. While at Curtis she developed a friendship with fellow students, composers Samuel Barber and Gian Carlo Menotti. Barber notably recruited her to sing in the New York premiere of his vocal chamber work Dover Beach in 1933. Bampton also sang several times with the Philadelphia Orchestra in the early 1930s under the baton of Leopold Stokowski. With the orchestra she notably sang the Wood-Dove in the United States premiere of Schoenberg's Gurre-Lieder (1932), was the soloist for a performance of Manuel de Falla's El amor brujo (1932), and sang the role of Kundry in a concert version of Parsifal (1933) among other performances.With Jeanette Vreeland and Paul Althouse, 9 and 11 April 1932, see Schoenberg discography Bampton made several appearances at the Bethlehem Bach Festival during the early 1930s. A recording of Bampton's performance of the Gurre-Lieder with the Philadelphia Orchestra reached the ears of Giulio Gatti-Casazza, then General Director of the Metropolitan Opera. Impressed with her performance, he contacted Bampton to come and audition for the company. She obliged and ended up being offered a Met contract. According to Opera News, Bampton initially hesitated to accept the invitation as \\"she had doubts as to whether her true vocal range was mezzo or soprano and was concerned about her lack of stage experience.\\" However, she relented and made her first appearance with the company for an out of town engagement in Philadelphia on November 22, 1932 as Laura Adorno in La Gioconda with Rosa Ponselle in the title role, Giacomo Lauri-Volpi as Enzo, and Giuseppe Sturani conducting. The Metropolitan Opera and international success: 1932-1950 Just six days after her Met debut in Philadelphia, Bampton made her first appearance at the actual Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, reprising the role of Laura. Over the next four years she sang mostly smaller role at the house: the Sandman in Hänsel und Gretel, Waltraute, Wellgunde, and the Voice from Above in Parsifal. The only two roles of more considerable size that she portrayed were, Amneris in Aida and Brangäne in Tristan und Isolde. During these years she began a romantic relationship with noted Canadian conductor and pianist Wilfrid Pelletier (1896–1982) who was a regular conductor at the Met and the husband of Quenna Mario, Rose's teacher at Curtis Institute. After Pelletier divorced his wife, the couple married in 1937 and, although happily married, never had children. By the year of her marriage, Bampton was feeling highly frustrated with her lack of good roles at the Met. She therefore decided to establish herself in the soprano repertoire, beginning with a portrayal of Leonora in Il Trovatore at the Met on May 7, 1937 with Arthur Carron as Manrico. Her Met career at the Met flourished after this point with her roles at the house over the next thirteen years including Donna Anna in Don Giovanni, Elisabeth in Tannhäuser, Elsa in Lohengrin, Kundry, and the title roles in Gluck's Alceste and Verdi's Aida among others. Her most frequent role at the house was Sieglinde in Die Walküre alongside Lauritz Melchior. In January 1940 she showed an incredible level of musical versatility when she sang performances of both Aida and Amneris within a week of each other at the Met. Her last and 112th performance at the house was as Elsa on April 17, 1950 with Set Svanholm in the title role and Fritz Stiedry conducting.Metropolitan Opera Archives, archives.metoperafamily.org; accessed May 30, 2014. In addition to singing at the Met, Bampton sang with many other opera companies throughout the world during the 1930s and 1940s, including performances in Europe and South America. In 1936-1937 she toured Germany and Czechoslovakia in concerts. She made her debut at the Bavarian State Opera as Leonora in 1936, and that same year appeared at the Semperoper in Dresden. In 1937 she made her only appearance at the Royal Opera at Covent Garden as Amneris. That same year she began a decade-long association at the Civic Opera House in Chicago, singing first with the Chicago City Opera Company and later the Chicago Opera Company. Some of her more acclaimed portrayals in Chicago included Maddalena in Andrea Chénier, Sieglinde, and Elsa. Between 1937 and 1939 Bampton toured England, the Netherlands, and Sweden in concerts. In June, 1939, she was in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, for the Community Concert Association. She sang at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires every year between 1942 and 1948, making her debut with the company as the Marschallin in Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier. At the Teatro Colón she tackled several roles that she never performed anywhere else, most notably several heroines in Strauss operas (Daphne, Chrysothemis and Ariadne), Eva in Die Meistersinger, Agathe in Der Freischütz, and Countess Almaviva in Le nozze di Figaro. In 1946 she appeared in operas at the Teatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro. In 1949 she sang two roles at the San Francisco Opera, Sieglinde and Donna Anna.San Francisco Opera Archives, archive.sfopera.com; accessed May 30, 2014. In autumn 1950 she made her only appearance with the New York City Opera, singing the Marschallin. Bampton also worked actively as a recitalist and concert performer during the 1930s and 1940s. She was a regular guest artist with the New York Philharmonic (NYP) and other orchestras. A fruitful professional association with Arturo Toscanini began in 1936, when Bampton sang in Debussy's La Damoiselle élue with the NYP, and included several broadcasts with the conductor and his NBC Symphony Orchestra. In 1944, she performed the role of Leonore for Toscanini's radio broadcast of Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Others in the cast included Jan Peerce and Eleanor Steber. The performance, originally broadcast in two parts, each on a separate week, was released years later on LP and still later on CD. It was Toscanini's first radio broadcast of a virtually complete opera - all of the music was included, but all of the dialogue (except for the spoken melodrama in the prison scene) was omitted. Later life and career: 1950-2007 Bampton and her husband both decided to leave the Met when Rudolf Bing was appointed the company's new general manager in 1950. Bampton stated in a 1989 interview that, \\"Both of us got the feeling that we wouldn't be happy with the new regime.\\" She continued to appear in operas into the early 1960s, although her opera schedule after 1950 was sparse in comparison to the schedule she kept in the 1930s and 1940s. Bampton's last opera performance was in Dialogues of the Carmelites as Mme. de Croissy at Mount Saint Mary College in Newburgh, New York in 1963. She continued to perform sporadically in recitals and concerts into the early 1970s. Her husband died in 1982 and she never remarried. After her opera career ended, Bampton embarked on a second career as a voice teacher, serving for lengthy periods on the voice faculties of Manhattan School of Music and the Juilliard School (1974–1991). She also had shorter stints on the faculties at University of North Carolina School of the Arts, Drake University and Adelphi University.

A liquid cooling and ventilation garment (LCVG) has additional crush-resistant ventilation ducts, which draw moist air from the wearer's extremities, keeping the wearer dry. In a fully enclosing suit where exhaled breathing air can enter the suit, the exhaled air is moist and can lead to an uncomfortable feeling of dampness or wetness. While this technology is most commonly associated with space suits, it is also used in a wide range of Earth-bound applications where open-air cooling is difficult or impossible to achieve, such as fire fighting, working in a steel mill and increasingly by surgeons during long or strenuous procedures.  Technology  There are typically two parts to a liquid cooling garment: * the heat collection garment and tubing * a heat exchanger for removal of heat from the circulated fluid  Garment and tubing  The garment is typically a close-fitting non-stretching fabric or a tight-fitting elastic fabric, with flexible tubing sewn onto the fabric. A single layer of fabric may be used, with the tubing either on the inside directly contacting the wearer's skin, or on the outside separated by the fabric. If two layers of fabric are used, stitched channels can be formed which enclose the tubing between the two fabric layers. Where flame resistance is needed, the garment may be constructed out of materials such as nomex. The tubing is typically a few millimeters in diameter, and may be made out of any number of flexible plastics such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or silicone. Smaller diameter tubing permits a higher degree of garment flexibility, but at a cost of lower heat absorption capacity, and increased pressure needed to push liquid through the tubing. When a large area needs to be cooled or the external environment also heats the tubing, a single long tube may not be enough because the liquid becomes saturated with heat and cannot cool any further. Making the liquid much colder is not an option since it leads to uncomfortable coldness where the liquid enters the tubes. Instead, multiple parallel tubes are used to increase the volume of liquid available to absorb heat. Skin coverage and tubing density can vary depending on the application. The garment may simply be a short-sleeved shirt, or it may be a full-body suit covering the arms and legs. Where the heat removal requirement is low, the tubing may be spaced several centimeters apart across the garment surface. Where there is a very large amount of heat to remove, the tubing can be arranged in a dense grid with no gaps between the tubes.  Heat exchanger  For portable earthbound applications, the heat exchanger for cooling the liquid can be very low-tech, consisting simply of a container for holding ice, and an electric pump to circulate water from the container through the tubing. The return water is cooled by the melting ice and again pumped through the tubes. Regulation of flow is done by varying pump speed or using an adjustable flow valve. Ice storage can be achieved using a belt-pack, a backpack, or a duffel bag, depending on the length of time needed for the cooling system to operate between refilling the ice storage. In situations where the wearer must stay in place inside a vehicle, heavy but long-term-operation heat exchangers can be used, such as a refrigeration system to cool the liquid. When the user's movement is partially hindered through the use of a life-support umbilical, cooling liquid can also be supplied via the umbilical.  Space applications  Astronauts commonly wear a liquid cooling and ventilation garment in order to maintain a comfortable core body temperature during extra- vehicular activity (EVA). The LCVG accomplishes this task by circulating cool water through a network of flexible tubes in direct contact with the astronaut's skin. The water draws heat away from the body, resulting in a lower core temperature. The water then returns to the primary life support system (PLSS), where it is cooled in a heat exchanger before being recirculated. In an independent space suit, the heat is ultimately transferred to a thin sheet of ice (formed by a separate feed water source). Due to the extremely low pressure in space, the heated ice sublimates directly to water vapor, which is then vented away from the suit. The ice sublimator consists of sintered nickel plates with microscopic pores which are sized to permit the water to freeze in the plate without damaging it. So when heat needs to be removed, the ice in the pores melts and the water passes through them to form a thin sheet which sublimates (like dry ice). When there is no heat needing to be removed, this water refreezes sealing the plate. The rate of sublimation of the ice is directly proportional to the amount of heat needing to be removed, so the system is self-regulating needing no moving parts. During EVA on the Moon, it had outlet gas temperature of ,Carson, Maurice A. \\"Apollo Portable Life Support System Performance Report.\\" Second Conference On Portable Life Systems. 1971, Page 54 As an example, during the Apollo 12 commander's first EVA (of 3 hrs, 44 minutes), of feedwater were sublimated, and this dissipated .Carson, Maurice A. \\"Apollo Portable Life Support System Performance Report.\\" Second Conference On Portable Life Systems. 1971, Page 60 The pores eventually get clogged through contamination and the plates need to be replaced.,Thomas, Kenneth S., and Harold J. McMann. US spacesuits, page 120 and following. Springer Science & Business Media, 2011. In a dependent space suit (such as the ones used in the Gemini program or within lunar orbit on the Apollo program), the heat is carried back to a host spacecraft through an umbilical connection, where it is ultimately radiated or sublimated via the spacecraft's own thermal control system. Because the space environment is essentially a vacuum, heat cannot be lost through heat convection, and can only be directly dissipated through thermal radiation, a much slower process. Thus, even though the environment of space can be extremely cold, excessive heat build-up is inevitable. Without an LCVG, there would be no means by which to expel this heat, and it would affect not only EVA performance, but the health of the suit occupant as well. The LCVG used with the Apollo/Skylab A7L suit could remove heat at a rate of approximately 586 watts. The LCVG used with NASA's Extravehicular Mobility Unit is primarily constructed of spandex, with a nylon tricot liner. The tubes are made of polyvinyl chloride.

It was started in 1974 by guitar builder and electronics expert Ian Waller and luthier Pete Stevens. Since 2009 it has been run by Paul Herman. History Wal 5-String Bass Wal basses founder, Ian Waller, was a bass player in 1960s Manchester pop scene. In the late 1960s he moved to London to follow a career as an electronics engineer. However, he quickly became involved in the film and then music industry because of both his electronics and woodworking skills. He became known to a number of players on the London session scene for his guitar making abilities, eventually being commissioned to build basses for them. Early custom basses were purchased by leading bass players from the London studio circuit, such as John Gustafson (at the time of Roxy Music) and John G. Perry (formerly of Caravan) who commissioned the first instrument branded as a \\"Wal\\" bass. Another early commission was for a triple- necked bass, purchased by Rick Wakeman for his bassist, Roger Newell, to use in \\"The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table\\" concerts. The bass was later given to Chris Squire of Yes and is now on loan to the Hard Rock Cafe. Later, a short run of semi-custom models (designated the JG series after the owner of one of the first models, John Gustafson) featured hand-tooled leather scratchplates. They introduced for the first time the distinctive eight coil humbucking pick-ups and proprietary bridge hardware which became a feature of all future Wal bass models. Owners of these models included John Entwistle, Paul Simonon, Gary Tibbs, Alan Spenner, and Percy Jones. The first full production range of Wal basses appeared in 1978 as the \\"Pro Series\\". These basses followed the basic design specifications of the JG series (solid ash body, maple, hornbeam and Amazonian hardwood neck and rosewood fingerboard) but replaced the leather scratchplate with a large plastic one. The Pro series offered a range of electronics options – one or two pick-ups and passive or active wiring. The active models introduced switchable filters for each pick-up allowing certain frequencies to be cut and boosted to provide a wider range of tonal options. In addition they featured a \\"pick attack\\" feature which boosted a narrow band of upper-mid range frequencies to simulate the attacking tone of a pick when playing fingerstyle. The Pro Series was superseded by the Custom Series in 1983. This introduced the laminated bodies now standard on Wal basses. Various woods such as American walnut, schedua/hydua, padauk and wenge were offered as standard facings over a mahogany core. During the 1980s the range was expanded to introduce 5-string and 6-string models and three distinct but similar body shapes were introduced. These are commonly referred to as Mark 1 (the original Custom 4-string style, developed from the shape of the JG and Pro Series), Mark 2 (introduced with the 5-string model this is a larger body but with a rounder profile at the bridge end of the body and a more asymmetric upper cutaway than the Mark 1). The Mark 3 body style was introduced with the introduction of the 6-string models in the early 1990s (these are essentially slimmer versions of the Mark 2 body style). Other rare models were also available periodically, including a MIDI-bass (the MB4 & MB5) and a simplified passive model. The popularity of the brand grew through the 1980s leading to an expansion of the company, although it retained its custom builder ethos and approach. In this period Paul Herman, who would later take over control of the company, began his first period working for Wal. During this period the basses found wide usage among both UK session players and a number of \\"name\\" bass players, e. g. Paul McCartney, Bruce Thomas, Geddy Lee, John Illsley, Martin Kemp, Flea, Justin Chancellor and others. Death of founder, restart In 1988, Ian Waller died of a heart attack at age 43, after which Pete Stevens continued running the business. However, through the period post-2000 a series of circumstances led to a significant contraction in the company. This culminated in Stevens working as a sole trader with little or no additional workforce, causing the supply of Wal basses to become increasingly limited. Around 2005 Pete Stevens' failing health and a number of changes to the company's workshop premises caused him to fall badly behind on the company's order book. By the end of 2007, Stevens' increasing health problems forced him to retire, leaving the future of the brand in serious doubt. However, on 20 August 2008, it was announced that business would resume under luthier Paul Herman, who had previously worked at Wal during the late 1980s and 1990s although production would move from High Wycombe to a workshop in Fetcham, Surrey. Herman cleared outstanding back-orders and on 5 October 2009, began inviting new orders again with the launch of a new Wal basses website. On 28 December 2011, Pete Stevens died, shortly after his 65th birthday.

Dudhope Castle is an extended late medieval tower house located on the southern face of Dundee Law in Dundee, Scotland. History Construction and private ownership The castle was originally built in the late 13th century by the Scrymgeour family, with the original castle being a smaller tower house. This was replaced around 1460. James V visited in April 1540.Athol Murray, 'Pursemaster's Accounts', Miscellany of the Scottish History Society X (Edinburgh, 1965), pp. 46. The castle was further extended in 1580 for James Scrimgeour and Magdalen Livingstone to its current L-plan structure with additional circular \\"angle\\" towers, although these were demolished in the 18th century. On the death in 1668 of John Scrimgeour, 13th The Story of Dudhope Castle. Published by the Dudhope Castle Fund Committee 1959 (or 14th)Historic Dundee by Colin Gibson. Published in aid of the Dudhope Castle Restoration Fund c. 1959 Constable, and first Earl of Dundee, King Charles II ignored the existence of the rightful heir, John Scrimgeour of Kirkton, and made a grant of Dudhope Castle and the office of Constable to Charles Maitland, a younger brother of the 1st Duke of Lauderdale. Later, when in financial difficulty, Maitland sold Dudhope Castle in 1684 to John Graham of Claverhouse, better known to most as \\"Bonnie Dundee\\". It was from Dudhope Castle that he departed for Killiecrankie in 1689; the victory which resulted in his death. In 1694, the King therefore made a grant of Dudhope Castle to Archibald Douglas. The Douglas family were thus the last family of occupants of the castle as this continued until about 1790. The history of Dudhope and the Constables are therefore inextricably interwoven with the history of Dundee. In fact, the two are inseparable. The office of Constable and occupancy of Dudhope Castle was held by four different families, as above, of which the Scrymgeours held the post for some 370 years.\\"The Scrimgeours and their Chiefs, Scotland's Royal Banner Bearers\\". R. W. Munro and Jean Munro. Published by The Scrimgeour Clan Association 1980. Other uses of the castle In 1792 the castle was rented in an attempt to use it as a woollen factory, although the plan never came to fruition. In 1795 the park and the grounds were leased to the Board of Ordnance, who used Dudhope as a barracks for 95 years, from 1796 to 1879. Additional buildings were constructed, including a hospital, officers quarters, stables and guard- rooms. The castle building itself was used as accommodation for 400 soldiers. The Board of Ordnance finally abandoned the castle in 1881. In 1854 the town council of Dundee acquired a sub-lease on the castle grounds, for use as recreational facilities. The lease ran for 35½ years for an annual rent of £25 until 1 November 1890. At this time the Earl of Home had intended to develop the grounds into terraced housing. Instead the council acquired the grounds for £31,700, raising £20,000 itself and the remaining being raised from generous citizens by Lord Provost Mathewson. The grounds were opened as a park on 28 September 1895 by Sir James Low. The building was later occupied by the Ministry of Works and was used as a military barracks during both the 1914–18 war and the 1939–45 war. A time gun was formerly located in the grounds of the castle and fired daily at 1pm. It ceased to be used in 1916 so as not do disturb patients at the nearby Dundee Royal Infirmary who were suffering from shell-shock. Redevelopment The castle passed to the corporation of Dundee who made an attempt to demolish the castle in 1958. In the years 1985 to 1988 the castle was redeveloped and is now in use as offices, a conference centre as well as housing the University of Abertay Dundee's Dundee Business School. During restoration, one of the main rooms was designated as the Scrimgeour room. It is furnished with wall hangings pertinent to the Scrimgeours and the drapes on the windows are made from material in the Scrimgeour tartan as arranged by the Scrimgeour Clan Association that was officially organized on 5 June 1971. In March 1998 a special dinner was held by the Clan Association in memory of the 700th anniversary of a charter to the Scrimgeours signed by William Wallace on 29 March 1298 and later reaffirmed in another charter signed by Robert the Bruce on 5 December of that same year.

Harrison initially let American guitarist Jesse Ed Davis record it for the latter's Ululu album (1972), in gratitude to Davis for his participation in the Concert for Bangladesh. When writing the song, Harrison drew inspiration from the legal issues surrounding the Beatles during the early months of 1971, particularly the lawsuit that Paul McCartney initiated in an effort to dissolve the band's business partnership, Apple Corps. The inclusion of \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" on Material World marked a rare example of a secular composition on Harrison's most spiritually oriented album. Recorded at the Beatles' Apple Studio in London, the track features his extensive use of the dobro-style resonator guitar, as well as musical contributions from Gary Wright, Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner. The song's musical mood and lyric recall aspects of old English square dance, a quality that some writers identify as mirroring the changing of sides amid the lawsuits relating to the Beatles' break-up. Some critics have compared the track with John Lennon's \\"How Do You Sleep?\\"; Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone magazine described it as a \\"clever Lennonist diatribe\\". Harrison performed \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" throughout his 1974 North American tour, utilising a funk-inspired arrangement that featured musicians Willie Weeks, Andy Newmark and Tom Scott. For these performances, Harrison modified the lyrics to reflect the former Beatles uniting against manager Allen Klein. The song's title was a phrase that Harrison and commentators adopted when referring to Beatles-related legal issues during the 1970s. A film clip containing Harrison's 1971 demo of \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" appeared on the DVD accompanying the 2006 remaster of Living in the Material World. Background and composition London's Royal Courts of Justice, where Paul McCartney sued his former bandmates in order to dissolve the Beatles' partnership As third songwriter to Lennon and McCartney,Tillery, p. 87. George Harrison had written about his experiences regarding the disharmonious atmosphere within the Beatles during the late 1960s,The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 40, 180. in compositions such as \\"Not Guilty\\",Clayson, p. 253. \\"I Me Mine\\",Greene, p. 115. \\"Wah-Wah\\"Leng, pp. 85–86. and \\"Run of the Mill\\".Allison, p. 153. The latter two songs, which reflect on the failing friendships among the Beatles,Inglis, pp. 25, 27. appeared on Harrison's critically acclaimed triple album All Things Must Pass, released in November 1970,Schaffner, pp. 142, 209. seven months after Paul McCartney's departure had initiated the band's break-up.Tillery, pp. 85, 90, 161. On 31 December of that year, McCartney filed suit against Apple Corps and his former bandmates at London's High Court of Justice,Doggett, pp. 153–54. in an effort to free himself from the legal obligations imposed on him by the Beatles' partnership,Schaffner, p. 136. and particularly from manager Allen Klein.Sounes, pp. 275–76.Woffinden, p. 43. Author Robert Rodriguez describes the situation as an \\"unfathomably sour turn of events\\" that \\"mystified\\" the public and angered fans of the Beatles.Rodriguez, p. 6. Beginning on 19 February 1971, the court heard reports from Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo Starr of McCartney's attempts to control the band,Badman, pp. 27–28, 30. and McCartney's equally unflattering assessment of Klein.Doggett, pp. 155–56, 157–58. Although the other three former Beatles had presented a united front against McCartney since his April 1970 departure from the band,Hertsgaard, p. 309. the recent publication of Lennon's scathing comments to Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner, about McCartney, Harrison and Starr, added to the ill- feeling surrounding the group.Rodriguez, pp. 3, 6, 24, 28. On 12 March, High Court judge Mr Justice Stamp ruled in McCartney's favour,Sounes, p. 279. appointing London accountant James Spooner as Apple Corps' official receiver.Doggett, pp. 162–63. While Lennon reportedly unleashed his anger that day by throwing two bricks through the windows of McCartney's St John's Wood home,Badman, p. 32. Harrison channelled his frustration into a new composition, \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\".Leng, pp. 126–27.Doggett, p. 157. Harrison biographer Simon Leng suggests that the song \\"takes a nearly impersonal overview of the Beatles' self-inflicted legal wounds\\".Leng, p. 127. In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison describes the opening verse as being \\"vaguely based on the Square dance type of fiddle lyric\\": In Leng's opinion, the song's lyrics \\"revel in the certainty that lawyers are an easy target for general scorn and a quick way of securing a common denominator\\". During the second verse, the line \\"It's affidavit swearing time\\" reflects real-life events – whereby Harrison, Lennon and Starr all submitted their statements to the court via affidavitBadman, pp. 27–28. – before Harrison concludes: \\"Now all that's left is to find yourself a new band.\\" In the third verse, Harrison predicts the eventual outcome of the lawsuit: A resonator guitar, similar to the instrument played by Harrison on the recording Author Ian Inglis identifies Harrison's use of the plural form \\"we\\" in the lyric as evidence of his hope for \\"a shared and sensible outcome\\" for the former Beatles, since the situation \\"disadvantages them all\\". While Harrison biographer Dale Allison interprets a degree of animosity towards the other Beatles in the song's lyrics,Allison, p. 112. Leng argues that they are directed solely at the legal profession. Inglis similarly dismisses the idea that Harrison was targeting his former bandmates; instead, the song expresses \\"frustration rather than hostility\\" and addresses the \\"absurdity\\" of the situation.Inglis, p. 39. Inglis writes of \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\": \\"It makes clear that amid the legal arguments, financial requirements, and technical language ... there are four former friends who are powerless to control events.\\" Regarding the song's square-dance theme, Leng suggests that folk dancing's cycle of about-turns and to-and-fro movement reminded Harrison of the Beatles' \\"seemingly endless, and pointless, legal orbits around one another\\". The song's lyrics are set against a blues-based bottleneck riff,Woffinden, p. 70. typical of Harrison's work at the time with the dobro.Leng, p. 108. Played in his favoured open E tuning,Spizer, p. 254. \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" was one of a number of bottleneck-inspired Harrison compositions from the early 1970s.Harrison, p. 234. The song title soon became part of regular Harrison parlance, as evidenced by his appearance on The Dick Cavett Show in November 1971,Rodriguez, p. 321. when he used the phrase to goad Capitol Records boss Bhaskar Menon over delaying the release of the Concert for Bangladesh live album.Badman, p. 55. Commentators similarly adopted \\"sue me, sue you blues\\" as a description for the litigation surrounding Harrison and his fellow ex-Beatles throughout the 1970s.Schaffner, p. 191.Woffinden, p. 44. Pre-Living in the Material World recording history Harrison's solo demo Harrison recorded a brief demo of \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\", in the Delta blues style,Allison, p. 156. which became available in the 1990s on bootleg compilations such as Pirate Songs. Leng describes this 1971 recording as \\"astonishing\\" and a \\"must\\" for inclusion on any forthcoming George Harrison anthology, with Harrison sounding like \\"a lost bluesman, bootlegged in Chicago\\". The demo was officially issued in September 2006, on the DVD included in the deluxe edition of Harrison's remastered 1973 solo album, Living in the Material World. The song is set to archival footage,\\"Living in the Material World Re-Issue\\", georgeharrison.com, 22 June 2006 (retrieved 4 October 2014). showing images of Harrison's National resonator guitar,Shawn Perry, \\"George Harrison, Living In The Material World – CD Review\\", vintagerock.com, October 2006 (retrieved 29 November 2014). over which his handwritten lyrics are superimposed. In the opinion of Music Box editor John Metzger, this version of \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" \\"stings more than its studio counterpart\\". Although the 2006 reissue lists it as an \\"acoustic demo version\\",Booklet accompanying Living in the Material World reissue (EMI Records, 2006; produced by Dhani & Olivia Harrison), p. 2. Harrison played electric slide guitar on the recording. The same film clip appears on the DVD exclusive to the Apple Years 1968–75 Harrison box set,Joe Marchese, \\"Give Me Love: George Harrison's 'Apple Years' Are Collected On New Box Set\\", The Second Disc, 2 September 2014 (retrieved 4 October 2014). released in September 2014.Kory Grow, \\"George Harrison's First Six Studio Albums to Get Lavish Reissues\\", rollingstone.com, 2 September 2014 (retrieved 4 October 2014). Jesse Ed Davis's version Harrison met Tulsa-born guitarist Jesse Ed Davis through mutual friends, singer-songwriter Leon Russell and drummer Jim Keltner,Rodriguez, p. 81. both of whom took part in the hastily arranged session for Harrison's \\"Bangla Desh\\" charity single in July 1971.Leng, p. 112. Russell also assisted Harrison in recruiting personnel for the associated benefit concerts, held at Madison Square Garden in New York,Spizer, pp. 240–41. and suggested Davis as a replacement for Eric Clapton, who was then dealing with a severe heroin addiction.Leng, p. 116.Clayson, p. 311. Both Davis and Clapton ended up playing at the two shows, on 1 August. In gratitude to Davis, Harrison offered him \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" for inclusion on his second solo album, Ululu.Rodriguez, p. 82. A former guitarist with blues singer Taj Mahal, Davis arranged the song as a Southern blues shuffle,Rodriguez, pp. 81–82. creating a \\"beautiful version\\" in the words of music critic Thom Jurek.Thom Jurek, \\"Jesse Ed Davis Jesse Davis/Ululu\\", AllMusic (retrieved 6 October 2014). As on the 1971 demo, which Harrison had passed on to Davis, this version of \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" omits the song's third verseMadinger & Easter, p. 439. and, at just 2 minutes 45 seconds, it is significantly shorter than Harrison's better-known 1973 recording.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 112. Other musicians on Davis's version include Keltner, Dr. John and Billy Rich.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 207. Like Keltner, Davis went on to work with all the former Beatles except McCartney during the 1970s, remaining close to Harrison and playing regularly with Lennon over the 1973–75 period.Ashley Kahn, \\"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\\", Mojo, July 2001, pp. 82, 84. Ululu was released in March 1972, before which Atco Records had issued \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" as the album's advance single on 25 January.Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 111–12. Davis co-produced the recording with Grammy Award- winning producer Albhy Galuten. In an interview with Los Angeles Free Press the following year, Davis expressed disappointment with his two albums on the Atco label and named \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" as one of the few songs he liked.Steven Rosen, \\"Rock and Roll's First Indian Superstar: Jesse 'Ed' Davis\\", Los Angeles Free Press, June 1973; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Living in the Material World recording Harrison returned to the song in December 1972, during a break in the sessions for his Living in the Material World album,Badman, pp. 83, 84. the start of which had been delayed by the various business and tax problems connected with his Concert for Bangladesh aid project.Lavezzoli, p. 194.Rodriguez, pp. 51–52. By this time, Harrison, Lennon and Starr had grown disaffected with manager Allen Klein and had chosen not to renew his contract.Doggett, pp. 192–93. Once album sessions resumed in January 1973, Harrison taped the basic track for \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" at the Beatles' Apple Studio, in central London.Badman, pp. 84, 89. Apple Studio, where Harrison recorded \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" Harrison was backed on the recording by Keltner on drums, keyboard players Gary Wright and Nicky Hopkins, and bassist Klaus Voormann. These musicians provided the core line-up throughout the Material World sessions,Leng, p. 125. in a deliberate move by Harrison to work with a small band and pare down the production after the excesses of All Things Must Pass.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 180. The recording begins with the song's single-chord riff, created by a combination of Hopkins' low piano notes and Harrison's dobro, before the rhythm shifts to what author Alan Clayson calls \\"downbeat hootenanny\\" over the verses.Clayson, p. 323. Leng identifies the rhythm as approximating the do-si-do dance step found in square dancing. Harrison takes the first solo, midway through the track, playing a second, overdubbed dobro, while Wright's Wurlitzer electric piano leads the instrumental passage that closes the song. Contrasting with his more substantial presence on All Things Must Pass, \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" marks a rare instance where Wright's keyboard work, rather than just Hopkins', features prominently on Living in the Material World.Leng, pp. 82, 91, 125. Harrison completed the song's vocals by late February, soon after his 30th birthday. He then travelled to Los Angeles for a series of Beatles-related business meetings held at the offices of Apple's US distributor, Capitol Records, primarily to discuss the upcoming Beatles compilations 1962–1966 and 1967–1970.Badman, pp. 90–91. While these two double albums were intended to foil bootleggers,Rodriguez, pp. 117–19. Doggett notes that the profits financed the Beatles' litigation against Klein until well into 1974.Doggett, pp. 211, 215. Release \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" was issued at the end of May 1973 as the second track on Living in the Material World,Badman, p. 102. following the album's lead single, \\"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\\".Spizer, p. 253. According to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, Harrison considered an alternative running order, whereby \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" was track 1 and \\"Give Me Love\\" opened side two of the album.Madinger & Easter, p. 440. In the UK cassette format, \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" was the opening track, followed by \\"The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)\\".\\"George Harrison – Living in the Material World (Cassette, Album)\\", Discogs (retrieved 16 December 2013). The song's inclusion marked the only secular composition on Material World.Woffinden, pp. 70–71. It also served as a rare foray into rock amid the album's abundance of spiritually themed balladsZeth Lundy, \\"George Harrison: Living in the Material World\\", PopMatters, 8 November 2006 (retrieved 4 October 2014).Schaffner, p. 159. and occasional acoustic-based pop such as \\"Give Me Love\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\\".Leng, pp. 126, 128. Reflecting the album content,Woffinden, pp. 69–70.Tillery, pp. 111–12. Tom Wilkes's design for the record's face labels contrasted a devout spiritual existence with life in the material world, by featuring a painting of Krishna and his warrior prince Arjuna on side one and a picture of a Mercedes stretch limousine on the reverse.Spizer, pp. 256, 258. Regarded by some as the most level-headed and musically consistent ex-Beatle in mid 1973,Clayson, p. 318. with \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" Harrison provided observers with another example in the band's tradition of self-referential songwriting.Doggett, pp. 142, 157. Leng has written of the public and the media \\"long[ing] for these further installments of 'the Beatles soap opera'\\", of which this song was \\"less paranoiac\\" than \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" and \\"not as roseate\\" as Starr's \\"Early 1970\\".Leng, pp. 85, 126–27. Reception On release, Billboard magazine noted \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" as a comment on \\"the Beatles and their mish-mash\\",Eliot Tiegel (ed.), \\"Top Album Picks\\", Billboard, 9 June 1973, p. 54 (retrieved 21 November 2014). while Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone described the track as \\"a biting slide-guitar showcase for Harrison, its lyric a clever Lennonist diatribe against such monetary quarrels as those that ended the Beatles\\".Stephen Holden, \\"George Harrison, Living in the Material World\\", Rolling Stone, 19 July 1973, p. 54 (retrieved 18 May 2013). In their respective books discussing the former Beatles' first decade as solo artists, Nicholas Schaffner and NME critic Bob Woffinden likewise praised Harrison's dobro playing, Schaffner likening it to the \\"vicious slide guitar work\\" Harrison had supplied for Lennon on \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" Woffinden compared \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" with Harrison's 1966 Beatles track \\"Taxman\\", as a composition that showed its author's \\"impatien[ce] with those who come between him and his money\\", and for that reason, found it \\"rather out of place\\" on Material World.Woffinden, pp. 70, 71. Recalling the album's release in The Cambridge Companion to the Beatles, Michael Frontani writes: \\"Harrison's slide-playing is featured throughout, with the swamp-drenched, nocturnal wails of 'Sue Me, Sue You Blues,' in particular, demonstrating his grasp of the form.\\"Frontani, p. 159. Among more recent reviewers, AllMusic's Lindsay Planer draws parallels with Lennon's compositions \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" and \\"Steel and Glass\\", and describes \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" as a \\"scathing rocker\\" in which Harrison \\"forgoes his trademark arid wit for a decidedly more acerbic and direct approach\\".Lindsay Planer, \\"George Harrison 'Sue Me, Sue You Blues'\\", AllMusic (retrieved 18 May 2013). To Zeth Lundy of PopMatters, \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" expresses Harrison's \\"passive-aggressiveness\\". John Metzger views the lyrics as \\"ridiculously simplistic\\" and the track as \\"perhaps, the most bilious song that [Harrison] ever penned\\".John Metzger, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\", The Music Box, vol. 13 (11), November 2006 (retrieved 4 October 2014). AllMusic critic Bruce Eder and Chip Madinger and Mark Easter instead recognise humour in Harrison's lyrics.Bruce Eder, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\", AllMusic (retrieved 26 May 2013). Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham views this track and \\"Try Some, Buy Some\\" as \\"wry, reasonable digs at symptoms of what Harrison sees as a diseased world\\",Ingham, p. 134. while Hugh Fielder of Classic Rock magazine recognises the song's place on its parent album, in that the legal wrangling \\"explains his retreat from the material world\\".Hugh Fielder, \\"George Harrison Living In The Material World\\", Classic Rock, December 2006, p. 98. Blogcritics' Chaz Lipp considers \\"the sinewy 'Sue Me, Sue You Blues'\\" to be among the highlights of Material World and a song that \\"rank[s] right alongside Harrison's best work\\".Chaz Lipp, \\"Music Review: George Harrison's Apple Albums Remastered\\", Blogcritics, 5 October 2014 (retrieved 6 October 2014). Among Harrison biographers, Ian Inglis finds an additional comic element in the use of dobro and, like Leng, sees the do-si-do rhythm as an apt musical metaphor for the changing alliances occurring in the courtroom through the early 1970s. Another author who recognises \\"a good pinch of humour\\" in the song, Elliot Huntley describes \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" as an \\"excellent\\" track, with a \\"magnificent steel guitar riff\\".Huntley, p. 90. Leng praises the performance of all the musicians on the recording, particularly Keltner, and describes it as \\"one of Harrison's most accomplished pieces\\". \\"It speaks of a very confident, classy musician near the height of his powers\\", Leng writes, while remarking on the contrast between Harrison in 1972–73 and the \\"resigned figure\\" he had portrayed in the Beatles' 1970 documentary film Let It Be. Live performance During an interview midway through Harrison's 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar, band leader Tom Scott described \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" as having been a certain inclusion in the setlist from the start of rehearsals, along with \\"What Is Life\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and Lennon's Beatles-era composition \\"In My Life\\".Michael Gross, \\"George Harrison: How Dark Horse Whipped Up a Winning Tour\\", CIrcus Raves, March 1975; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Harrison gave \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" a new musical arrangement, the track \\"reborn as horn-driven funk\\", Leng writes, via the all-American rhythm section of Willie Weeks and Andy Newmark, and Scott's three-piece horn section.Leng, pp. 167, 171. In a feature article for Rolling Stone that otherwise savaged the opening West Coast portion of the Harrison–Shankar tour,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 44.Leng, pp. 160, 174. Ben Fong-Torres wrote approvingly of its inclusion while bemoaning the paucity of other \\"familiar Beatles or Harrison songs\\" in the setlist.Ben Fong-Torres, \\"Lumbering in the Material World\\", Rolling Stone, 19 December 1974, p. 59. The tour coincided with speculation about a possible Beatles reunion,Schaffner, pp. 176, 178. as well as an agreement regarding the official dissolution of their partnership, which would be ratified following the receipt of all four members' signatures in December 1974.Doggett, p. 227. With Starr opting to sign in London, to avoid being subpoenaed by Klein upon entering the United States, Harrison and McCartney provided their signatures in New York on 19 December.Badman, p. 139. Throughout the tour, Harrison changed a line in \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" to reflect the turnaround in his, Lennon's and Starr's allegiances over the previous two years – \\"Bring your lawyer and I'll bring Klein\\" name-checking the common enemy of all four ex-Beatles by 1974.Doggett, pp. 216, 226. Instead of a copy of the Bible, as in the studio versions of the song, Harrison now sang \\"Hold your Gita in your hand\\".Clayson, pp. 338–39. Despite his plans for a live album and a concert film, no recording of this or any other Harrison song from the tour has ever received widespread official release.Madinger & Easter, p. 447. A noted performance of \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" appears on bootlegs from his show at Long Beach Arena,Clayson, pp. 337–38. where, Leng writes, \\"the crowd was buzzing\\", so \\"set[ting] the tone\\" for a series of successful concerts in America's Southern states.Leng, p. 170. During this Long Beach performance, on 10 November,Madinger & Easter, p. 445. Harrison followed his lyric about \\"find[ing] yourself a new band\\" with the quip \\"I think I've got one of those!\\", reflecting his claim that he was having \\"too much fun\\" with his current musicians to consider a Beatles reunion.

His artistic media is paintings. Belbruno received his associate degree from Mitchell College, his Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from New York University and his PhD in mathematics from New York University's Courant Institute in 1981, where his mentor was mathematician Jürgen Moser. He was employed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory from 1985 to 1990 as an orbital analyst on such missions as Galileo, Magellan, Cassini, Ulysses, Mars Observer, and others. His artwork in the NASA collection, Charles Betlach II collection, and exhibited in Paris, Rome, Los Angeles, Washington DC, New York City, Minneapolis, Shanghai, WeiHai, and Princeton. During that time, he laid the foundations for the first systematic application of chaos theory to space flight originally called fuzzy boundary theory, which allows for the construction of very low energy paths for spacecraft. In 1990 Belbruno applied his ideas for low energy transfer orbits to the Japanese lunar probe Hiten, which had been designed only for lunar swing-by and had suffered a failure of the Hagoromo lunar orbiter. The main Hiten probe lacked the fuel to enter lunar orbit using a conventional Hohmann transfer trajectory, but Belbruno was able to devise a ballistic capture trajectory that would put it in lunar orbit using only a negligible amount of fuel. The probe entered lunar orbit in 1991, the first time that Belbruno's ideas had been put to the test. Belbruno had first proposed using a low-energy transfer orbit for a JPL probe in 1988. However, he faced a great deal of skepticism, and found himself in conflict with engineers. He had also expected to make no progress on Hiten, but the Japanese proved receptive to his ideas and called ballistic capture an \\"amazing result.\\" He left JPL in fall of 1990 and took a position at Pomona College.Belbruno, Edward.

Belbruno is president and founder of the company Innovative Orbital Design, Inc., based in Princeton, New Jersey and holds patents on routes in space.

A slow, heavily orchestrated ballad, it is one of many Harrison love songs that appear to be directed at either a woman or a deity. Harrison wrote and recorded the song during the height of his public devotion to Hinduism; on release, Rolling Stone described its lyrics as \\"a sort of Hindu In Paradisium\\". Recording for \\"That Is All\\" took place in London in late 1972, following Harrison's completion of the international aid project begun the previous year with the Concert for Bangladesh. The other musicians on the track include keyboard players Gary Wright, whose fledgling solo career Harrison actively supported during the early 1970s, and Nicky Hopkins. The song's orchestral and choral arrangements were provided by John Barham, who had also worked on Harrison's album All Things Must Pass and Wright's Footprint. \\"That Is All\\" has been covered by singers Andy Williams and Harry Nilsson. Background As with all the songs on his 1973 album Living in the Material World except for \\"Try Some, Buy Some\\",Huntley, pp. 49–50, 64. George Harrison wrote \\"That Is All\\" over 1971–72, a period marked by both his heightened devotion to Hindu spiritualityHuntley, pp. 87–89.Leng, p. 124. and his commitment to providing humanitarian aid for the refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War.Lavezzoli, pp. 193–94.Doggett, p. 192. With his own career taking second place to the latter endeavour,Kevin Howlett, \\"George Harrison The Apple Years\\", in book accompanying The Apple Years 1968–75 box set (Apple Records, 2014; produced by Dhani Harrison, Olivia Harrison & Jonathan Clyde; package art direction by thenewno2), p. 31. following the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971,Clayson, pp. 308, 314–17, 318.Leng, p. 123. Harrison's musical activities included helping American musician Gary Wright establish himself as a solo artist.Rodriguez, pp. 87–88, 319–20, 321.Wright, pp. 97–99. Wright's album Footprint was released in November that year and included \\"Love to Survive\\",Castleman & Podrazik, p. 105. a song that author Simon Leng cites as having been an influence on Harrison's composition \\"That Is All\\".Leng, pp. 108, 135. \\"Love to Survive\\" was orchestrated by Harrison's All Things Must Pass arranger, John Barham,Wright, pp. 98–99. who says that \\"musically there was a strong rapport\\" between himself, Harrison and Wright at this time.Leng, p. 108. The friendship was also based on a shared interest in Eastern spirituality,Rodriguez, p. 87.Leng, pp. 124–25, 209. after Harrison had given Wright a copy of Autobiography of a Yogi,Wright, p. 93. a text that Ravi Shankar had introduced to Harrison when he visited India in 1966.Tillery, p. 56. In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison comments only briefly on \\"That Is All\\", saying: \\"The melody came to me and I then had to think of lyrics. That's all.\\"Harrison, p. 264. Commentators have remarked on how, like many other Harrison compositions – \\"Long, Long, Long\\", \\"Something\\", \\"What Is Life\\",Richie Unterberger, \\"George Harrison 'What Is Life'\\", AllMusic (retrieved 27 July 2012). \\"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\\", \\"Learning How to Love You\\" and \\"Your Love Is Forever\\" among themHuntley, pp. 167–68.Schaffner, p. 115. – it serves as both a conventional love song to a woman and a declaration of devotion to God.Leng, pp. 207–08. Harrison said in a 1976 interview: \\"I think all love is part of a universal love. When you love a woman, it's the God in her that you see.\\"The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 132. Composition Gary Wright (pictured on stage in 2011), whose song \\"Love to Survive\\" provided inspiration for \\"That Is All\\" The song is in the musical key of A.\\"That Is All\\", in George Harrison Living in the Material World: Sheet Music for Piano, Vocal & Guitar, Charles Hansen (New York, NY, 1973), p. 84. Leng identifies the composition as a development of Harrison's favoured \\"Something\\" ballad style.Leng, p. 135. He writes that a number of \\"characteristic\\" Harrison musical devices are found in \\"That Is All\\" – such as a melody that rises by a half step with each line, and an A minor chord sharpened to an augmented triad \\"to create drama\\".Leng, pp. 135–36. Author Ian Inglis describes the song's melody as \\"romantic\\". Referring to its status as the last track on Living in the Material World, he also comments on the appropriateness of Harrison's opening words:Inglis, p. 43. \\"That is all I want to say\\".Harrison, p. 266. Inglis writes that Harrison goes on to state both \\"[what] he wants to do for his lover\\" and \\"what he hopes for in return\\", in the respective lines \\"To try to love you more\\" and \\"A smile when I feel blue\\". Leng considers that the song's middle eight echoes the same \\"tongue-tied difficulty\\" that Harrison had first introduced in his 1966 composition \\"I Want to Tell You\\":Leng, p. 136. According to Leng, the change here from a regular 4/4 time signature to 3/8 provides a \\"stuttering, hesitant syntax\\" that supports the message behind the words. Theologian Dale Allison views the concept of \\"words falling short\\" in these lyrics as central to \\"That Is All\\" and a recurring theme in Harrison's songwriting.Allison, pp. 124, 156. Allison also notes the importance of silence in this and other Harrison song lyrics, where it becomes \\"not an enemy to be shunned but ... a friend to be embraced, for silence can help conduct us to the Divine\\".Allison, p. 124. On release, part of the middle eight's lyrics, together with those for the final verse, were identified by music critic Stephen Holden as \\"a sort of Hindu In Paradisium\\".Stephen Holden, \\"George Harrison, Living in the Material World\\", Rolling Stone, 19 July 1973, p. 54 (retrieved 24 July 2012). While he considers \\"That Is All\\" to be a secular, \\"adult-oriented\\" love song, Inglis writes of Harrison's message in the middle eight: \\"language is insufficient to express the depth of his emotion; 'silence' can be more effective, more intimate, more loving.\\" Recording The recording sessions for Living in the Material World began in October 1972Madinger & Easter, p. 439. after Harrison had spent part of the summer staying with Wright in Portugal.Badman, pp. 79, 83.Huntley, pp. 85, 87. Although Harrison had intended to co-produce the album with Phil Spector as before, he decided to work without him,Spizer, p. 254. partly as a result of Spector's erratic behaviour at the start of the sessions.Timothy White, \\"George Harrison: Reconsidered\\", Musician, November 1987, p. 53.Huntley, pp. 88–89. In his 2014 autobiography, Wright says that Spector's dismissal was \\"the right move\\";\\"When Gary Wright Met George Harrison: Dream Weaver, John and Yoko, and More\\", The Daily Beast, 29 September 2014 (retrieved 15 March 2015). he describes Material World as his favourite Harrison album and \\"a beautiful masterpiece showing more of him – without Phil Spector's production\\".Wright, p. 107. Aside from Harrison, and Wright on keyboards, the musicians on \\"That Is All\\" were Nicky Hopkins (on piano), Klaus Voormann (bass) and Jim Keltner (drums). As with \\"Who Can See It\\", another of the album's ballads, Harrison recorded \\"That Is All\\" using a Leslie rotary effect on his electric guitar.Leng, p. 129. Having long admired Spector as a producer, he employed elements of his signature production style throughout Material World,Schaffner, pp. 137, 159–60. but with a degree of subtlety in comparison to the big sound synonymous with All Things Must Pass.Clayson, p. 323.John Metzger, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\", The Music Box, vol. 13 (11), November 2006 (retrieved 17 July 2012). As on the latter album,Schaffner, pp. 159–60. Harrison overdubbed further instrumentation onto the basic tracks recorded in October and November 1972;Kevin Howlett's liner notes, booklet accompanying Living in the Material World reissue (EMI Records, 2006; produced by Dhani & Olivia Harrison), p. 11. in the case of \\"That Is All\\", the released recording includes a slide guitar solo, and a harpsichord part played by Wright. The song also features string and brass orchestration and a choir, all of which were arranged by John Barham.Rodriguez, p. 156. Work on the album extended through February 1973.Badman, p. 89. The London sessions for Barham's contributions marked the last time that Harrison worked with him during the 1970s.Mat Snow, \\"George Harrison: Quiet Storm\\", Mojo, November 2014, p. 72. Their collaborations had taken in Harrison's Wonderwall Music, All Things Must Pass and Living in the Material World,Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 195, 197, 198. as well as Apple projects for Billy Preston,Album credits, That's the Way God Planned It CD (Capitol/Apple Records, 1991; produced by George Harrison, Wayne Schuler & Ray Charles). Jackie Lomax and Radha Krishna Temple (London).Leng, pp. 108, 281. Release and reception Apple Records issued Living in the Material World at the end of May 1973, or late June in Britain.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 125. \\"That Is All\\" was sequenced to follow \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\",Spizer, pp. 253, 256. a song that reflected Harrison's idealism after the Concert for Bangladesh,Leng, pp. 134–35. as well as his frustration at the apathy of governments who had chosen not to intervene on the refugees' behalf.Rodriguez, p. 154. As with eight other tracks on the albumSchaffner, p. 160. and the 1973 B-side \\"Miss O'Dell\\",Harrison, p. 385. Harrison donated his publishing royalties and the copyrightBook accompanying Collaborations box set by Ravi Shankar and George Harrison (Dark Horse Records, 2010; produced by Olivia Harrison; package design by Drew Lorimer & Olivia Harrison), p. 32. for \\"That Is All\\" to his Material World Charitable Foundation.Madinger & Easter, p. 438. Writing in Melody Maker, Michael Watts described Living in the Material World as \\"Harrison's personal statement\\" documenting his journey towards \\"a spiritual goal which for the first time he has been able to define\\".Michael Watts, \\"The New Harrison Album\\", Melody Maker, 9 June 1973, p. 3. Watts continued: \\"now he stands as something more than an entertainer. Now he's being honest. When you've been through all the bullshit and come out the other side, that's the only thing you can be.\\" In his review for Rolling Stone, Stephen Holden praised the album's \\"inspirationally, opulently, romantic\\" qualities, and he wrote of \\"That Is All\\" and \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\" as \\"two devotional prayers whose solemn mantra-influenced melodies are barely able to sustain their lush orchestration. Yet they do, so that at the end we are left suspended in ethereality ...\\" Holden added that \\"a close listening from start to finish is roughly equivalent to participating in a mass spectacle of religious re-dedication – one that does not end with rousing anthems but in heavenly choirs.\\" Some reviewers objected to the preponderance of ballads on the album, however, as well as the overt religiosity of many of its songs.Lavezzoli, p. 195. In his book The Beatles Solo on Apple Records, Bruce Spizer describes \\"That Is All\\" as \\"a beautiful love song written either for a woman or the Lord\\".Spizer, p. 256. Writing for Rough Guides, author and critic Chris Ingham similarly considers that \\"the 'love' [Harrison is] so desperate to express\\" in the song \\"seems directed as much to an earthly relationship as to any God\\", and he cites this as an example of the \\"restraint and, in places, considerable grace and beauty\\" adopted by Harrison on the album.Ingham, p. 134. Among other Beatles biographers, Robert Rodriguez writes that the track \\"sums up the journey\\" in the same way as \\"Hear Me Lord\\" successfully concludes the song cycle on All Things Must Pass, a view shared by Elliot Huntley, who admires \\"That Is All\\" as a \\"lush orchestral prayer where George really does prostrate himself at His feet\\".Huntley, p. 94. Reviewing the 2014 Apple Years reissue of Material World, Joe Marchese of The Second Disc highlights \\"That Is All\\" among songs that combine to provide the album's \\"earnest and intensely personal, yet wholly accessible, statement\\".Joe Marchese, \\"Review: The George Harrison Remasters – 'The Apple Years 1968–1975'\\", The Second Disc, 23 September 2014 (retrieved 3 October 2014). Cover versions Given the song's mood and sentiment, authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter consider \\"That Is All\\" to have been suitable for inclusion on a Frank Sinatra album.Madinger & Easter, p. 441. While Sinatra did not record it, the song was covered by singer Andy Williams, who had been one of the many easy listening artists, along with Sinatra, to cover Harrison's \\"Something\\".Robert Fontenot, \\"Something: The history of this classic Beatles song\\" (page 2), oldies.about.com (retrieved 11 March 2015). Featuring contributions from Hopkins, Voormann and Keltner,Album credits, Solitaire LP, 1973 (Columbia Records KC 32383; produced by Richard Perry). Williams' version of \\"That Is All\\" appeared on his 1973 album Solitaire.William Ruhlmann, \\"Andy Williams Solitaire\\", AllMusic (retrieved 11 March 2015). The recording was produced by Richard Perry, with whom Harrison worked on Ringo Starr's album Ringo in Los AngelesBadman, pp. 92, 95. shortly after completing Living in the Material World.Leng, pp. 138–39.Madinger & Easter, p. 440.

The song appears twice there, as the opening track and as a reprise to close the album.Rodriguez, p. 233. Author and critic Alyn Shipton comments that Nilsson's performance on \\"That Is All\\" marked a rare return to the upper-register singing style of his early career. Shipton describes Nilsson's break into falsetto as being \\"as good as anything he ever recorded\\".Shipton, p. 208.

Harrison was inspired to write the song following the successful Concert for Bangladesh shows, which were held in New York on 1 August 1971 as a benefit for refugees from the country formerly known as East Pakistan. The lyrics reflect his disappointment that such a humanitarian aid project was necessary, given the abundance of resources available across the planet, and his belief that if all individuals were more spiritually aware, there would be no suffering in the world. Adding to Harrison's frustration while writing the song, the aid project became embroiled in financial problems, as commercial concerns delayed the release of the Concert for Bangladesh album, and government tax departments failed to embrace the goodwill inherent in the venture. Harrison recorded \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\" in England between October 1972 and March 1973. The recording features an orchestral arrangement by John Barham and a similarly well-regarded vocal performance from Harrison. The other contributing musicians were Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann, Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner. Reviewers have described the composition variously as a protest song, a devotional prayer, and a counterpart to John Lennon's peace anthem \\"Imagine\\". As with all the new songs released on Living in the Material World, Harrison donated his publishing royalties from the track to the Material World Charitable Foundation, an organisation he set up to avoid the tax problems that had befallen his Bangladesh relief effort. The song typifies Harrison's ideal for a world unencumbered by national, religious or cultural delineation. In 2009, Voormann and Yusuf Islam covered \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\" and released it as a single to benefit children in war-torn Gaza. Background In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison describes the period following the two Concert for Bangladesh shows as \\"very emotional\\". The concerts took place at Madison Square Garden, New York, on 1 August 1971, as the first part of his fundraising program for the 8–10 million refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War.Lavezzoli, p. 187. The generosity of all the participants, together with the response from the general public,Clayson, p. 317. encouraged Harrison to feel \\"very positive about certain things\\". At the same time, the fact that it had fallen to musicians such as himself and concert instigator Ravi Shankar to address the issue left Harrison \\"slightly enraged\\", given the wealth of resources available to governments around the globe.George Harrison, p. 226. Author Gary Tillery writes that, through his humanitarian gesture, Harrison had \\"changed the perception\\" of rock musicians, \\"making it clear they could be good world citizens too\\",Tillery, p. 100. while music critic Mikal Gilmore has noted of Harrison's \\"cautious yet optimistic and tender\\" worldview: \\"[it] stood in stark contrast to the ugly dissolution of the Beatles and the defeated idealism that then characterised so much of rock & roll culture.\\"The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 40. The day after the Madison Square Garden concerts, Harrison began writing the song \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\", having stayed in New York to work with producer Phil Spector on the proposed live album of the event.Badman, p. 45.Spizer, p. 241. The Concert for Bangladesh album release Harrison found frustration in this next phase of the Bangladesh project, as the various record companies associated with the concerts' performers attempted to profit from the forthcoming release.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 43.Doggett, pp. 180–81, 192. Chief among these was the Beatles' US distributor, Capitol Records, who delayed issuing the albumGreene, p. 193. in the hope of negotiating a royalty rate to cover what they perceived as high distribution costs for the boxed three-record set. Harrison was resolute that Capitol should absorb the costs, just as the Beatles' Apple record label had already paid for the album's lavish packaging and full-colour booklet.Badman, p. 58.Leng, p. 121. All those involved with the concerts and post-production on the live album had given their services for free, in keeping with Harrison's hope that, in Tillery's words: \\"Every penny of income – from the gate receipts to the profits from an album and a film – would go toward alleviating the suffering.\\"Tillery, p. 96. By early October 1971, bootleg recordings of the concerts were available in New York,Badman, p. 50. potentially denying funds to the refugees. On 23 November, Harrison's exasperation with the situation saw him raging against Capitol president Bhaskar Menon during a late-night television interview with Dick Cavett, and threatening to take the album to a rival label.Badman, pp. 55, 58.\\"Big Bop Baby\\", Contra Band Music, 4 May 2012 (retrieved 17 March 2013). Menon then backed down, ceding much of the distribution rights to Columbia/CBS,Clayson, pp. 314–15. whose artist Bob Dylan had made a successful comeback at the Concert for Bangladesh.Spizer, pp. 241–42. Further delaying the release until well into December, wholesalers objected to Apple's financial terms,Doggett, p. 181. which ensured that wholesalers and retailers could make little profit on each copy shipped. Ignoring the spirit behind the release, author Peter Lavezzoli writes, some US retailers \\"engaged in shameless price gouging\\". Legal and taxation issues The Nixon administration supported Pakistani president Yahya Khan (left) during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Of greater detriment to the project in the long term, Harrison's business manager, Allen Klein, had neglected to register the concerts as UNICEF fundraising benefits before they had taken place.Lavezzoli, p. 193.George Harrison, p. 61. As a result, the American and British tax departments were demanding a share of the proceeds from the live album and Saul Swimmer's concert film, ignoring Harrison's appeals that an exception be made in the case of this humanitarian disaster.Clayson, pp. 315–16. Until India's defeat of Pakistan on 16 December, America continued to supply arms and financial aid to the Pakistani army, led by General Yahya Khan,Lavezzoli, pp. 189, 194. despite reports of genocide being committed against the Bangladeshis.Mark Dummett, \\"Bangladesh war: The article that changed history\\", BBC News Online, 16 December 2011 (retrieved 14 October 2013). In reply to a New Yorker's offer to start a petition to make the US Treasury scrap its tax on the Concert for Bangladesh album, Harrison wrote: \\"Until the [politicians] become human, we must do our service to others without their help.\\"Clayson, pp. 316, 479. Although Rolling Stone and other countercultural publications lauded the Bangladesh concerts as proof that \\"the Utopian spirit of the Sixties was still flickering\\", in the words of author Nicholas Schaffner,Schaffner, p. 148. Harrison addressed, in \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\", the corporate greed and governmental apathy he had encountered.Leng, p. 135.Rodriguez, pp. 51, 154. While staging the concerts Harrison had made a point of distancing himself from the politics behind the war in what was formerly known as East Pakistan,Clayson, p. 307. and he similarly advocated peace activist Swami Vishnudevananda's proposal for Planet Earth passports – whereby \\"[one truth] underlies all nations, all cultures, all colours, all races, all religions\\".Olivia Harrison, pp. 296–97. Referring to the song and the moral responsibility of wealthy Western nations, he says in I, Me, Mine: \\"If everyone would wake-up and do even a little, there could be no misery in the world.\\" Composition Author Robert Rodriguez describes \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\" as both \\"an expression of gratitude to all the good hearts that had contributed to the success [of the Bangladesh benefits]\\", and a \\"stinging indictment\\" of governments who had the power to help but instead \\"turned their backs when it suited their ends to do so\\".Rodriguez, p. 154. Harrison musical biographer Simon Leng notes also Harrison's dismay at how the 1960s countercultural revolution had failed to influence the motivations of the music business – to the extent that the altruism behind the Concert for Bangladesh \\"was almost torpedoed by boardroom balance sheets\\".Leng, pp. 121, 134–35. A slow-paced ballad, the song's opening verse reflects Harrison's optimism and idealism, on the one hand:Spizer, p. 255. His frustration is evident from verse two, where, in what Leng terms a \\"knee-jerk reaction\\" to the politics behind the Bangladesh crisis,Leng, p. 137. Harrison sings of a world \\"Losing so much ground / Killing each other, hand in hand\\".George Harrison, p. 225. In the song's middle eight, Leng suggests, Harrison identifies the absence of humility as the root of humankind's problems, and concludes: These lines have led to conflicting interpretations among Harrison biographers regarding a supposedly superior attitude on the singer's part. Ian Inglis writes of \\"an increasingly familiar elitism in his apparent perception of himself\\", adding: \\"When [Harrison] sings of 'the pure of heart' and tells the Lord that 'there are just a few who bow before you,' the implied conclusion is that he counts himself among their number.\\"Inglis, p. 42. While acknowledging the ambiguity of this message, Leng writes: \\"This could be taken as Harrison's statement of his own spiritual superiority, or it might be his metaphor for a rejection of conceit. If ego-driven politicians and self- serving military leaders were able to bow before anything, even a 'concept' like God, the world would be a better place. 'The Day the World Gets 'Round' laments human nature and calls for a little humility.\\" Commentators draw comparisons between \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\" and the work of Bob Dylan, pictured on stage in 1980, during his born-again Christian period. Dale Allison, a Christian theologian, views these lyrics as a song-wide message where Harrison \\"mourns how few are working for a better world and paying homage to God\\".Allison, p. 140. Allison refutes the idea of any elitism or superiority in Harrison's compositions, suggesting: \\"George nowhere claims to have arrived [at his spiritual goal]; he is rather always a pilgrim, always on the road. In the words of 'The Day the World Gets 'Round,' he is one of those who has 'made a start,' nothing more.\\"Allison, p. 22. The same three biographers comment on the comparisons between Harrison and Dylan that were encouraged by this and other Harrison songs from 1971–73,Allison, p. 37.Inglis, pp. 42, 44.Leng, pp. 126, 134–35. during a period when, author Peter Doggett writes, the ex-Beatle was \\"arguably music's most influential figure\\".Doggett, p. 175. Leng views Harrison's call for humility in \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\" as \\"identical to the thrust\\" of Dylan's \\"Masters of War\\", a protest song written about the 1962–63 Cold War arms race.Sounes, p. 131. Inglis suggests that whereas Dylan adopts the more analytical approach of an observer in his politically themed songs, Harrison \\"appears as a campaigner who is there to convert\\"; his words duly carry \\"a suggestion of self- satisfaction\\", Inglis opines, while also remarking on the \\"overall pessimism\\" of \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\".Inglis, pp. 42–43. Allison contrasts the song with \\"Slow Train Coming\\", a lyrically uncompromising Dylan composition reflecting the American singer's late-1970s conversion to born-again Christianity, and cites \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\" as an example of how Harrison's worldview instead \\"entails a happy ending\\". Recording Speaking in February 1977,Badman, p. 203. Harrison told BBC Radio's Anne Nightingale that the Bangladesh relief project took \\"two years solid\\" of his life. Doggett describes 1972 as a year of \\"recuperation and retreat\\" for the ex-Beatle, interspersed with meetings \\"to determine which department of which government was now stalling the funds so desperately needed in the newly independent nation\\".Doggett, p. 192. Harrison received UNICEF's \\"Child Is the Father of Man\\" award in New York on 5 June 1972 and then oversaw the delayed British release of the Concert for Bangladesh film on 27 July,Badman, pp. 74, 79. after which he was able to dedicate himself to working on the long-awaited follow-up to his 1970 triple album, All Things Must Pass.Greene, p. 194.Rodriguez, p. 137. Sessions for Living in the Material World took place at Apple Studio in central London and at Harrison's Friar Park studio, FPSHOT,Leng, p. 124. beginning in October 1972.Spizer, p. 254. Despite his original intention to co-produce with Phil Spector as before, Harrison was sole producer throughout the sessions,Huntley, p. 88. with Phil McDonald again serving as recording engineer. While Harrison succeeded in paring down the album's production after the Wall of Sound excesses of All Things Must Pass,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 180. commentators note that he incorporated aspects of Spector's signature style on this and other songs on Material World, through the use of orchestral strings and brass, a choir and multiple drummers.Schaffner, pp. 159–60.Woffinden, p. 71. On the basic track for \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\", Harrison used the same rhythm section that had supported him at the Concert for Bangladesh – bassist Klaus Voormann and drummers Ringo Starr and Jim KeltnerLavezzoli, p. 200. – along with keyboard players Nicky Hopkins and Gary Wright.Leng, p. 134. The latter's contribution, on harmonium, is prominent on the take available unofficially on Living in the Alternate World, a bootleg compilation containing pre-overdubbed versions of the officially released songs, but was subsequently superseded by John Barham's orchestral arrangements.Madinger & Easter, pp. 439–41. As an example of a more subtle production aesthetic compared with Spector's,Clayson, p. 323. Harrison \\"gave the tunes breathing space, allowing the instruments to sparkle\\", Rodriguez writes.Rodriguez, p. 156. His chiming acoustic-guitar harmonics sound out alone during the occasions when the words \\"The day the world gets 'round\\" are sung. Inglis describes Barham's string arrangement on the recording as \\"almost identical\\" to that on John Lennon's Beatles composition \\"Across the Universe\\",Inglis, p. 43. and other reviewers have similarly likened \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\" to that song, and to the All Thing Must Pass tracks \\"Isn't It a Pity\\" and \\"Beware of Darkness\\". Along with Harrison's vocal parts, the overdubs for Barham's contributions took place in London during the first two months of 1973.Badman, p. 89. Mixing on the album was completed by the start of March, shortly before the Concert for Bangladesh won the Grammy Award for best album of 1972.Madinger & Easter, pp. 440, 501. Material World Charitable Foundation President Ford and Shankar at the White House in December 1974 On 26 April 1973, Harrison set up the Material World Charitable Foundation,Badman, p. 98. to which he donated the publishing royalties from \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\" and eight other songs on Living in the Material World.Schaffner, p. 160.Tillery, p. 162. Part of the foundation's mission was to \\"encourage the exploration of alternative life views and philosophies\\" and \\"[support] established charitable organizations with consideration to those with special needs\\"Book accompanying Collaborations box set by Ravi Shankar and George Harrison (Dark Horse Records, 2010; produced by Olivia Harrison), p. 32. – so allowing Harrison to donate money without encountering the problems that had hampered the Bangladesh aid project.Michael Gross, \\"George Harrison: How Dark Horse Whipped Up a Winning Tour\\", Circus Raves, March 1975; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 5 June 2013).Madinger & Easter, p. 438. In his 2009 book You Never Give Me Your Money, Doggett writes that the foundation \\"continues to fund worthy causes to this day\\".Doggett, p. 207. The first event sponsored by the Material World Charitable Foundation was Ravi Shankar's Music Festival from India,\\"Material World Charitable Foundation\\" > About, georgeharrison.com (retrieved 2 June 2013). in September–October 1974,Madinger & Easter, p. 442. following which Harrison and Shankar toured North America together.Schaffner, p. 176. During their stopover in Washington, DC, Harrison used his audience with US president Gerald Ford to ask for presidential intercession into the ongoing IRS audit that was still holding the Bangladesh fund's US proceeds in escrow.Lavezzoli, pp. 193, 196. Release Apple Records released Living in the Material World in late May 1973,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 125. with \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\" appearing as the penultimate track.Spizer, p. 253. Reflecting the album content,Woffinden, pp. 69–70.Tillery, pp. 111–12. Tom Wilkes's design for the LP's face labels contrasted a devout spiritual existence with life in the material world, by featuring a painting of the Hindu god Krishna and his warrior prince Arjuna on side one, and a picture of a Mercedes stretch limousine on the reverse.Spizer, pp. 256, 258. The latter image was a detail taken from Ken Marcus's inner gatefold photograph, which depicted Harrison and his fellow musicians at a Last Supper-style banquet.Spizer, p. 256. The album was a commercial success,Madinger & Easter, p. 439. topping America's Billboard 200 chart for five weeks,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 364. thus ensuring the Material World Charitable Foundation a considerable injection of funds.Ingham, pp. 127–28.Olivia Harrison, p. 302. The release reflected Harrison's continued belief in the power of music to instigate change in the world,Schaffner, p. 159. an ideal that distinguished Material World as the last of \\"rock's grand statements\\", Leng suggests, and \\"the final fading of the 1960s dream into middle-age contentment and fiscal luxury\\".Leng, p. 141. Author and former Mojo editor Mat Snow writes of the timing of the album's US release: \\"he caught a public mood that craved an echo of 1960s idealism as America was gripped by the cynicism revealed in the Watergate hearings.\\"Snow, p. 39. Reception In a highly favourable review in Rolling Stone magazine,Huntley, pp. 95, 112. Stephen Holden described Living in the Material World as \\"inspirationally, opulently, romantic\\" and referred to \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\" as a \\"devotional prayer\\" that, combined with the album-closing \\"That Is All\\", left the listener \\"suspended in ethereality\\".Stephen Holden, \\"George Harrison, Living in the Material World\\", Rolling Stone, 19 July 1973, p. 54 (retrieved 30 May 2014). Decades later, Bruce Eder of AllMusic was likewise impressed, writing that Harrison's singing \\"soars magnificently in his heartfelt performance\\".Bruce Eder, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\", AllMusic (retrieved 30 May 2014). While Holden admired Harrison's lyrics for imparting \\"an extraordinary sincerity that transcends questions of craftsmanship\\", other reviewers bristled at the apparent preachiness in songs such as \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\".Woffinden, pp. 70–71.Clayson, p. 324. Peter Doggett has commented on the impression left among music critics: \\"the prevailing tone of the record was moral disapproval, never an attractive quality in a popular singer.\\" In his 1996 biography on the ex-Beatle, Alan Clayson praised Harrison's vocal performance on a song that, although \\"naive\\", \\"smouldered from the angered question of why a mere pop star rather than a governing body was obliged to pinpoint iniquities\\", Clayson adding that \\"never had his pipes been so adept\\" as on Material World.Clayson, pp. 317, 324. To Greg Kot, writing in Rolling Stones posthumous tribute to Harrison, \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\" and the ballad \\"Who Can See It\\" \\"aspire to a hymnlike calm but never rise to the transcendent heights of [All Things Must Pass]\\".The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 188. Writing for Blogcritics, Seattle-based music critic\\"Chaz Lipp\\", The Morton Report (retrieved 6 October 2014). Chaz Lipp views the production on Material World as \\"meticulous\\" and superior to its predecessor, such that \\"[t]he delicate melodies of songs like 'The Day the World Gets 'Round' and 'Be Hear Now' are never lost in bombast.\\"Chaz Lipp, \\"Music Review: George Harrison's Apple Albums Remastered\\", Blogcritics, 5 October 2014 (retrieved 6 October 2014). In his review of the 2006-remastered album, for Mojo magazine, Mat Snow wrote of \\"this long overdue reissue\\" being \\"worth it alone for four wonderful songs\\", one of which was \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\".Mat Snow, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\", Mojo, November 2006, p. 124. More recently, Snow has praised the song for its \\"deep and delicious emotion\\" and comments that through the idealism Harrison expressed on Living in the Material World, he was \\"without qualification, perhaps more loved and respected as a human being\\". In Simon Leng's opinion, the track is \\"a classic 1960s protest song\\" – Harrison's reaction to the failure of that decade's social revolution to create any meaningful change. While comparing the song to Dylan's \\"epoch-making 'Masters of War'\\", Leng notes that the \\"political essence\\" of \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\" is often overlooked due to the lyrics' \\"framework of spiritual redemption\\". Dale Allison similarly labels it \\"a passionate protest song of deep disillusionment\\", reflecting \\"the broken utopian dreams of the 1960s\\".Allison, pp. 70, 140. Allison groups \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\" with \\"Bangla Desh\\" and \\"Far East Man\\" as obvious examples of Harrison's \\"humanitarian impulse, his concern for the world and its people\\".Allison, pp. 69–70. Elliot Huntley views the song as a \\"strong candidate\\" for the album's best track, thanks to its \\"stunning structure and melody twists\\".Huntley, p. 94. Barham's orchestration complements the message \\"perfectly\\", according to Huntley, who praises also the middle eight, where Harrison \\"lets rip with his vocals\\". Less impressed with the composition, Ian Inglis acknowledges the importance of Barham's contribution – the ascending string arrangement being \\"the most startling facet\\" of the song musically. Robert Rodriguez describes the track as an \\"earnest counterpart\\" to Lennon's song \\"Imagine\\".

Islam said that he came across the song while looking through albums by Harrison, whom he described as being \\"more responsible than any other artist for initiating Pop music's movement to aid people and countries stricken by wars and calamities\\". Besides Voormann and Islam, the musicians on the recording include Luke Potashnick and Cassiano De Sa (guitars), Nikolaj Torp (keyboards) and Kristoffer Soone (drums).News: \\"Klaus joins Yusuf on songs for charity\\" , yusufislam.com, 13 January 2009 (retrieved 2 June 2013).

It is viewed as a statement on Harrison's discomfort with the attention afforded him as an ex-Beatle and features a prominent contribution from English session pianist Nicky Hopkins, along with a highly regarded slide guitar solo from Harrison. Around the time it was recorded, in late 1972, \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\" was rumoured to be the title track of the forthcoming album. Harrison originally intended it as a song for English singer Cilla Black, whose version of his 1970 composition \\"When Every Song Is Sung\\" he produced before starting work on Living in the Material World. An early acoustic demo of the song, a solo performance by Harrison, appeared as the closing track on the 2012 compilation Early Takes: Volume 1. Background and composition In early August 1972, in between overseeing the UK release of Saul Swimmer's Concert for Bangladesh documentary and heading up to Liverpool to catch Ravi Shankar's recital at the Philharmonic Hall,Badman, pp. 79, 80. George Harrison tried recording \\"When Every Song Is Sung\\", a ballad from the All Things Must Pass era, as a single for Cilla Black.Clayson, p. 332.\\"'I'll Still Love You (When Every Song Is Sung)' – a 'lost' song penned for Cilla by George Harrison receives May 2003 release\\" , CillaBlack.com, 1 April 2003 (retrieved 13 March 2012). Although the project was not completed, just like Harrison's attempt to record the same song with Ronnie Spector the year before,Madinger & Easter, pp. 434, 440. he later decided to write a B-side for her, which would become \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\".Harrison, p. 268.Kevin Howlett, booklet accompanying Living in the Material World reissue (EMI Records, 2006; produced by Dhani & Olivia Harrison). In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison explains that the lyrics dealt with the \\"Local boy/girl makes good\\" phenomenon, where the public initially supports someone who achieves success yet are then disapproving if fame or success changes that person. Both he and Black were from Liverpool and had become famous quickly, after which many people considered their personalities had changedInglis, p. 39. – a common link that Harrison thought of basing the intended B-side around. After he had come up with the opening two lines, however, the theme soon evolved into something more personal.Spizer, p. 254. At the 27 July 1971 press conference preceding the Bangladesh concerts,Badman, p. 43. Harrison had admitted he was \\"flattered\\" and \\"honour[ed]\\" to be receiving the same attention and acclaim once reserved for the Beatles.The Concert for Bangladesh Revisited with George Harrison and Friends DVD, Apple Corps, 2005 (directed by Claire Ferguson; produced by Olivia Harrison, Jonathan Clyde & Jo Human).Pieper, p. 26. A year later, though, his words to \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\" were a plea for freedom from public scrutiny regarding his Beatle past, musical biographer Simon Leng writes, to allow him to \\"pursue his spiritual quest\\" unencumbered by the weight of others' expectations.Leng, p. 128. This negative scrutiny Harrison found \\"hateful to anyone that is happy or 'free' \\", the lyrics continue, while he targets its purveyors as living \\"their lives without looking to see / The light that has lighted the world.\\" Harrison argues in I Me Mine that things can never stay the same – \\"the whole of life is a change: from the morning to the evening, from spring to winter ... from birth to death ...\\" This viewpoint is reflected in the song's second verse, where he bemoans those who make a point of resisting change, \\"As if nature itself, they'd prefer rearranged\\", because for them, \\"there's so little chance to experience soul\\". The song ends more optimistically, with his declaration: Instead of giving the track to Cilla Black, Harrison used it for his own album, Living in the Material World, recording for which began in October 1972. While analysing the song's lyrics, Leng opines that, like \\"Who Can See It\\", \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\" betrays Harrison's tendency towards \\"internalization of world events\\", and the fact that he wrote these words while still in his twenties is a \\"testament to the sheer psychological pressure\\" of the Beatles experience and superstardom generally.Leng, pp. 127–28, 129–30. At its core, Leng suggests, the song is asking: \\"What right do you have to inspect me, just because I made a few records?\\" \\"He didn't like celebrity,\\" Elton John observed of Harrison in a 2002 Rolling Stone Press tribute book. \\"I think he'd had enough by 1970 to last three lifetimes ... He found something worth more than fame, more than fortune, more than anything.\\"The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 232–33. In her introductory piece to the same publication, written two months after his death, Olivia Harrison quoted from the words to \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\" as an example of her late husband providing the \\"live background music to our lives\\": \\"If I played three chords on the uke (compulsory instrument in our home), he would be my band. George was so generous and 'grateful to anyone that is happy or free.' A good moment to him was always worth making better.\\"Olivia Harrison, \\"A Few Words About George\\", in The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 11. Recording Pianist Nicky Hopkins (pictured in 1973), whose playing features prominently on \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\" and other songs from Material World In a December 1971 interview for Disc and Music Echo, Nicky Hopkins – \\"the world's best-known anonymous pianist\\", as that magazine termed him – had talked of his plans to start work on his own solo album early the following year.Andrew Tyler, \\"Nicky Hopkins\\", Disc and Music Echo, 4 December 1971; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required; retrieved 21 July 2012). \\"I'll probably be doing it with George Harrison,\\" he said. \\"I'd really like to do that because, with George, I feel a very close thing ... We just seem to understand each other on a personal level so well.\\" Like Harrison's long-awaited follow-up to All Things Must Pass, the Hopkins solo project was delayed by other commitments until the autumn of 1972, but the mutual understanding that Hopkins referred to was much in evidence on Living in the Material World; Leng describes the English keyboard player's contributions as \\"the most prominent instrumental voice\\" on the album aside from Harrison's distinctive slide guitar.Leng, p. 125. On \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\", the recording is underpinned by Gary Wright's stately harmonium and Harrison's acoustic rhythm guitars, and is dominated by Hopkins' piano.Huntley, p. 91. The instrumental section, in between the two verses, featuring first Hopkins and then Harrison, has received much positive comment.Clayson, p. 323.Stephen Holden, \\"George Harrison, Living in the Material World\\", Rolling Stone, 19 July 1973 (retrieved 13 March 2012). The track's solemn tempo has been likened to that for \\"Tears of Rage\\" and \\"I Shall Be Released\\" by the Band. An alternative studio version of the song, an outtake from the October–December 1972 album sessions, appears on the Living in the Alternate World bootleg.\\"George Harrison – Living In The Alternate World (CD)\\", Discogs (retrieved 21 July 2012). Featuring a more prominent and melodic harmonium part from Wright, and devoid of Harrison's overdubbed second and third acoustic-guitar parts and his electric slide guitar, this version of \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\" ends with an attractive vocal falsetto in place of the official release's bottleneck flourish.Madinger & Easter, p. 440. Release and reception \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\" was issued in mid 1973 as the third track on Living in the Material WorldCastleman & Podrazik, p. 125. and is the first of a trio of slow-paced songs throughout the album that covers Harrison's preoccupation with breaking free from the past and others' perceptions (the second and third being \\"Who Can See It\\" and \\"Be Here Now\\").Leng, pp. 130. 137. Some months before this, the working title of the album was said to be The Light That Has Lighted the World.Badman, p. 83.Allison, p. 149. According to author Keith Badman, it was only in January 1973 that the name was changed to Living in the Material World.Badman, p. 89. As with eight other tracks on the albumSchaffner, p. 160. and the 1973 B-side \\"Miss O'Dell\\",Harrison, p. 385. Harrison donated his publishing royalties and the copyrightBook accompanying Collaborations box set by Ravi Shankar and George Harrison (Dark Horse Records, 2010; produced by Olivia Harrison; package design by Drew Lorimer & Olivia Harrison), p. 32. for \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\" to his Material World Charitable Foundation.Madinger & Easter, p. 438. On release, the song was viewed as possessing both of the traits that a some reviewers disliked about its parent album: too slow in tempo, and with lyrics \\"too smug for rock 'n' roll\\".Lavezzoli, p. 195. Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone described it as \\"an oblique defense against public criticism and expectations of a Beatle reunion\\" and, the \\"sustained\\" instrumental break aside, \\"pretty leaden stuff\\" due to the funereal pace. NME critic Bob Woffinden found the music \\"exceptionally fine\\" and opined that the song \\"could rank with his best compositions\\".Woffinden, p. 71. The problem, in Woffinden's opinion, was that, with the advent of glam rock in the UK while Harrison delayed following up on his 1970–71 solo success, \\"half the record-buying public\\" were more likely to view the song title as a reference to Gary Glitter.Woffinden, p. 72. Writing in Melody Maker, Michael Watts described the album as \\"Harrison's personal statement\\", documenting his journey towards \\"a spiritual goal which for the first time he has been able to define\\".Michael Watts, \\"The New Harrison Album\\", Melody Maker, 9 June 1973, p. 3. Amid the \\"large autobiographical insights\\" offered in Harrison's new compositions, Watts wrote of \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\"'s role in the song cycle: \\"Until finally he climbed over the rocky patches and found his own Shangri-La, becoming transformed in the process.\\" Retrospective appraisal Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002, Greg Kot referred to the song's \\"condescending autobiographical vein\\", which he found echoed in Harrison's 1974 riposte to his detractors, \\"Dark Horse\\".The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 188. To Bruce Eder of AllMusic, \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\" is one of the tracks on Material World that suffers from seeming \\"weighed down with their own sense of purpose, in ways that All Things Must Pass mostly (but not entirely) avoided\\".Bruce Eder, [ \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\"], AllMusic (retrieved 19 April 2012). Similarly unimpressed, Eight Arms to Hold You authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter write: \\"One would think that the 'light' might have given George a bit more happiness to reflect upon, but hey, the slide work's great!\\" The outtake available on the Alternate World bootleg, they add, was \\"believe it or not, even more lugubrious that the commercial version\\". Beatles biographer Alan Clayson also compliments Harrison's slide-guitar work, writing of his \\"controlled grace\\" while \\"shining up the octaves\\" during the solo. Another biographer, Elliot Huntley, approves of the \\"grandiloquent ballad tone\\" of this and other songs on the album, and admires the \\"tasteful\\" rhythm section on \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\" and Harrison's \\"jangling\\" acoustic guitars.Huntley, pp. 91, 92–93. Having interviewed Harrison for Guitar World magazine in 1987, Rip Rense has likened the guitar solo to that on the Beatles' \\"Fixing a Hole\\", as examples of how Harrison's solos display \\"structure, syntax, and development\\" over \\"pyrotechnic flourishes\\". Rense adds: \\"These are thoughtful and original, deceptively simple sounding, invested with feeling.\\"Rip Rense, \\"There Went the Sun: Reflection on the Passing of George Harrison\\", Beatlefan, 29 January 2002 (retrieved 14 December 2014). Writing for Goldmine in January 2002, Dave Thompson rated \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\" an \\"unquestioned highlight\\" and \\"a song hallmarked by distinct echoes of Lennon's Imagine\\".Dave Thompson, \\"The Music of George Harrison: An album-by-album guide\\", Goldmine, 25 January 2002, p. 17. In his review of the 2006 reissue of Living in the Material World, for Q magazine, Tom Doyle included the song among the album's best three tracks and wrote: \\"the introspective moods of The Light That Has Lighted The World and Who Can See It, with their ornate instrumentation and weepy vocals, are lovely things.\\"Tom Doyle, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\", Q, November 2006, p. 156. Reviewing the 2014 Apple Years Harrison reissues, in Mojo, Doyle writes of Material World having \\"spotlit the spirituality and the dreaminess\\", through \\"the gentle, non-preachy The Light That Has Lighted The World and Be Here Now, both great works of look-around-you wonder\\".Tom Doyle, \\"Hari Styles: George Harrison The Apple Years 1968–1975\\", Mojo, November 2014, p. 109. In his review for Record Collector, Oregano Rathbone highlights the song among Harrison's output over 1973–75, writing: \\"Living In The Material World, Dark Horse and Extra Texture may tend towards earnest, careworn, mid-tempo slow- burners, but each contains shivery moments of release: The Light That Has Lighted The World, Far East Man and This Guitar (Can't Keep From Crying) spring to mind.\\"Oregano Rathbone, \\"George Harrison – The Apple Years 1968–75\\", Record Collector, December 2014 (retrieved 4 December 2014). New Zealand Herald journalist Graham Reid writes of Harrison having been \\"emotionally isolated\\" during the Material World era, and adds: \\"[The] gloss of his position as a revered former Beatle/Bangladesh patron and spiritual guide was starting to tarnish him ... He was sounding ungracious and irritable, but wrapping the message up in melodically interesting songs.\\" Reid cites \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\" as a track where Harrison \\"nailed it\\", and an example of how \\"this album can be very moving.\\"Graham Reid, \\"George Harrison Revisited, Part One (2014): The dark horse bolting out of the gate\\", Elsewhere, 24 October 2014 (retrieved 4 December 2014). Writing for the music website No Ripcord, Matt Bevington describes the composition as \\"perhaps his most revealing lyrical work and exemplary of his ability to convey with both charming humour and coarse honesty\\". Bevington adds: \\"it reads like a precious sermon ...\\"Matt Bevington, \\"Music Reviews: George Harrison Early Takes Volume 1\\", No Ripcord, 31 May 2012 (retrieved 4 December 2014). Simon Leng considers the song \\"alarmingly direct\\" lyrically, and melodically strong, but, in the wider context of Harrison's career during the first half of the 1970s, he detects a \\"scalded-cat reaction\\" that would encourage critics to pounce on his next release, Dark Horse.Leng, pp. 90, 128. Leng draws parallels with Joni Mitchell's \\"Ludwig's Song\\" and \\"Shadows and Light\\" – two tracks dealing with criticism and harsh judgement that duly attracted more of the same. Like Clayson and Holden, Leng views the mid-song soloing on \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\" as a highlight: \\"a rolling, lilting passage from Nicky Hopkins, topped by one of Harrison's finest performances,\\" he writes. \\"In the closing bars of the statement, repeated as the song's coda, the guitar vocalizes a series of six-string sobs. George finally made his guitar gently weep.\\" While echoing Leng's sentiments, Guitar World editor Damian Fanelli includes the slide soloing on his list of Harrison's best post-Beatles \\"Guitar Moments\\".Damian Fanelli, \\"George Harrison's 10 Greatest Guitar Moments After the Beatles\\", guitarworld.com, 24 February 2016 (retrieved 28 May 2016). Unlike Leng, Ian Inglis views the lyrics as Harrison \\"[resisting] the temptation to criticize\\", since instead the unenlightened \\"have his sympathy\\". To Inglis, the song's weakness is that the \\"light\\" Harrison is striving to see is never made clear; whether it's love, spiritual enlightenment, or even the Beatles, \\"who, after all, have illuminated the world for many millions of people\\". The meaning is clear to theologian Dale Allison, who sums up \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\" as an \\"achingly beautiful\\" song that \\"expresses resentment toward those who dislike the ex-Beatle George but thanksgiving for those who reflect the light of God\\".Allison, pp. 22, 149. Other versions In Martin Scorsese's 2011 documentary George Harrison: Living in the Material World, the song is played over footage of the April 1970 announcement of the Beatles' break-up, following a clip of Harrison and Paul McCartney signing the \\"Beatles Agreement\\" legal papers in December 1974.George Harrison: Living in the Material World DVD (Disc 2), Village Roadshow, 2011 (directed by Martin Scorsese; produced by Olivia Harrison, Nigel Sinclair & Martin Scorsese).\\"Ring Out the Old\\", Contra Band Music, 23 October 2012 (retrieved 30 December 2012).

Six months later, this version was issued on the Early Takes: Volume 1 compilation.Stephen Thomas Erlewine, \\"George Harrison Early Takes, Vol. 1\\", AllMusic (retrieved 30 August 2012). In an interview with MusicRadar, compilation producer Giles Martin said that the unpolished aspect of Harrison's performance made him uncertain at first about whether to include the song on Early Takes. Martin continued: \\"It sounds like he's playing it to just one person late one evening, which is very George ... It's a little bit special; it shows how George could make something simple sound very spiritual, almost dreamy in a way ... I think this works beautifully as a closer.\\"Terry Staunton, \\"Giles Martin on George Harrison's Early Takes, track-by-track\\", MusicRadar, 18 May 2012 (retrieved 4 December 2014). Graham Reid has described the Early Takes version as, variously, a \\"superb demo\\" and \\"a revelation\\".Graham Reid, \\"George Harrison: Early Takes Vol 1 (Universal)\\", Elsewhere, 30 April 2012 (retrieved 4 December 2014).

He was born and grew up in Melbourne and was educated at Geelong Grammar School. After leaving school he worked in his family's leather business, while studying part-time and publishing articles and photographs on natural history. In 1960 he resigned from the family business to become a full-time freelance writer and photographer. Pizzey joined the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) in 1948 and served on its Council 1969-1975 and its Records Appraisal Committee 1976–1979. He may be best known as the author of one of the most popular field guides for Australian birds. In 1986 he was awarded the Australian Natural History Medallion. In 2000 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in applied science from RMIT University for contributions to natural history. He was a Member of the Order of Australia. In 2005 he was posthumously awarded the John Hobbs Medal. Pizzey wrote numerous articles on natural history for newspapers and magazines. Some of his books are: *Pizzey, Graham. (1958).

Like the album's title track, it was inspired by the teachings of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), more commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement. The song is an uptempo rock track with elements of blues and gospel. Some commentators have described it as the musical highpoint of Living in the Material World, with Harrison's slide guitar playing singled out as being among the finest performances of his career. The composition originated during a period marked by Harrison's devotion to a Hindu-aligned ascetic life and the height of his public association with the Hare Krishna movement, which included his donation of Bhaktivedanta Manor for use as an ISKCON temple. In his lyrics, Harrison sings of the falsehood of striving for wealth or power in the material world and advocates a direct relationship with one's deity as a genuine life goal. In doing so, he belittles the role of political leaders, as well as his own status as a celebrated rock musician. The song's Krishna Conscious message was also reflected in Harrison's choice of artwork for the Material World album, specifically the reproduction of a painting from a Prabhupada-published edition of the Bhagavad Gita. Harrison recorded \\"The Lord Loves the One\\" between October 1972 and March 1973 with session musicians Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann, Jim Keltner and Jim Horn. While the music has invited critical praise, the devout assertions in Harrison's lyrics typified what some reviewers in 1973 viewed as an overly didactic message on much of the parent album. Among reviewers in the 21st century, the composition continues to divide opinion. Although some commentators consider it an obvious choice as a live track, Harrison performed \\"The Lord Loves the One\\" only once in concert – on the opening night of his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar. Background In his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, George Harrison credits the influence for \\"The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)\\" to A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada,George Harrison, p. 254. founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), also known as the Hare Krishna movement.Allison, p. 45. Harrison's association with ISKCON began in December 1968,Tillery, p. 69. when he befriended a small group of devotees that Prabhupada had sent to London to establish what became the Radha Krishna Temple.Greene, pp. 103, 106.Muster, p. 26. The Gaudiya Vaishnava teachings of Prabhupada, based on Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, resonated with Harrison,Greene, pp. 150–51. whose quest for an ego-less, God- conscious existence amid the false reality of Beatlemania had first taken him to India in September 1966.The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 33–34, 36.Lavezzoli, p. 176. Swami Prabhupada (front row, second from left) and devotees in conversation with Karlfried Graf Dürckheim during the 1970s Harrison provided the devotees with financial assistance,Lavezzoli, p. 195. in addition to producing their hit recording of the 5000-year-old Hare Krishna mantra, to help spread the message of Krishna Consciousness.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 180.Olivia Harrison, p. 236. He then met Prabhupada in England in September 1969Tillery, pp. 71–72, 161. and was impressed by the acharya's declaration that he was merely \\"the humble servant of the servant of the servant\\" of the Hindu god Krishna.Clayson, p. 269.Greene, pp. 85, 149–50. In line with Prabhupada's contention that the chanting of Sanskrit mantras led to a direct connection with God,Tillery, p. 58. Harrison adopted the practice, counting out each mantra on Hindu prayer beads stored inside a cloth bag that he wore over his shoulder.Clayson, pp. 247, 299.O'Dell, pp. 139–40, 154. Further Harrison-produced recordings by the Radha Krishna Temple followed their \\"Hare Krishna Mantra\\" single, culminating in an eponymous album released on Apple Records in May 1971.\\"The Radha Krishna Temple\\", Apple Records (retrieved 1 June 2014).Castleman & Podrazik, p. 101. By that time, the devotees were regular guests at Harrison's Friar Park estate,Clayson, p. 306. and he subsequently bought permanent accommodation for the growing UK arm of ISKCON, at what became known as Bhaktivedanta Manor.Dwyer & Cole, pp. 31–32. When Prabhupada died in November 1977, he bequeathed one of the rings he was wearing to Harrison, referring to him as the Hare Krishna movement's \\"archangel\\".Clayson, p. 268.Greene, p. 225. Composition Author Dale Allison writes of the lyrical themes in \\"The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)\\": \\"this song preaches karma, warns about judgment at death, and exalts love as our most important aspiration.\\"Allison, p. 149. Harrison wrote the song over 1971–72, a period of heightened devotion on his part,Huntley, pp. 87, 89.Clayson, pp. 318–19. as well as one of frustration due to the legal and business issues afflicting his Concert for Bangladesh aid project. The idea for the composition came about after a conversation with Prabhupada,Tillery, p. 112. when the latter visited Harrison at Friar Park.George Harrison, p. 254. The song begins with a riff over the chords of B major and B7,George Harrison Living in the Material World: Sheet Music for Piano, Vocal & Guitar, p. 76. which is then followed by a chorus, rather than a verse.George Harrison, p. 256. Author Simon Leng describes the musical mood as \\"mean, dirty blues – funky and low-down\\", accompanying a \\"most uncompromising lyric\\".Leng, p. 132. In Allison's view, the lyrics to the chorus equate love received from one's deity with \\"human love\\" (in that it \\"grows as it is reciprocated\\"), while also serving as a statement on karmic retribution:Allison, p. 126. The first verse reflects Harrison and Prabhupada's discussion that day – although the reference to political leaders \\"acting like big girls\\" is an example of Harrison reverting to \\"Scouse parlance\\", according to author Alan Clayson.Clayson, p. 322. The latter also notes the antipathy that Harrison felt towards politicians following the Bangladesh aid project, when the American and British governments continued to withhold funds intended for the millions of starving Bangladeshi refugees.Clayson, pp. 315–16, 317. The lyric centres on maya, or the illusory nature of human existence, as Harrison sings of humankind behaving as if \\"we own this whole world\\", oblivious to the consequences and the end that awaits the individual in this life.Allison, pp. 79, 85. Allison summarises the message to mean: \\"karma is the law of our existence; substituting ego for God is our problem; we must prepare ourselves for death.\\"Allison, pp. 45–46. As with another Prabhupada-inspired track that he wrote during this period, \\"Living in the Material World\\",Lavezzoli, pp. 194–95. Harrison expresses his belief that the pursuit of fame and riches – particularly in the music industry – is meaningless.Leng, p. 131. In the second verse of \\"The Lord Loves the One\\", he sings: \\"We all fool around, with objectives in mind / To become rich or famous, with our reputations signed ...\\"George Harrison, p. 257. While author Joshua Greene compares Harrison's songs from this period to Vedic sutras,Greene, p. 194. Allison specifies this verse-two message to a passage from the Katha Upanishad, which reads: \\"Intoxicated, deluded by the glamour of riches, the childish do not see that they must pass away. They think, 'This is the world and there is no other.'\\"Allison, p. 85. As with the ISKCON-inspired \\"Awaiting on You All\\", Allison views the conditions that Harrison imposes in the song's choruses as a rare exception within the singer's work. Elsewhere, Allison continues, Harrison's songwriting reveals \\"a strong belief in the efficacy of unmerited divine grace\\".Allison, pp. 126, 129. In a 1982 interview, Harrison described his statement on God rewarding those who first look to God as a \\"flexible\\" one, adding: \\"In one way, I'm never going to get out of here [i.e., escape the constant cycle of reincarnation] unless it's by His grace, but then again … [t]he amount of grace I would expect from God should be equal to the amount of grace I can gather or earn.\\"Chant and Be Happy, pp. 29–30. Among other Harrison biographers' interpretations of the lyrics, Ian Inglis writes of Harrison's unwelcome \\"evangelical\\" message regarding \\"the consequences of a life of selfishness and greed which finds no place for 'the Lord'\\". In contrast, Leng views the verses as \\"the singer's inner conversation\\", in which Harrison acknowledges the futility of his own existence, at a time when he felt overwhelmed by his success as a solo artist following the Beatles' break-up in 1970.Leng, pp. 132, 137–38. Of the apparent sermonising in the choruses, Leng concludes: \\"'The Lord Loves the One' conveys the same basic message as 'what you put in is what you get out,' so, at one level, it's more a matter of common sense than divine revelation.\\" Recording Harrison began sessions for his Living in the Material World album in October 1972,Leng, p. 124. at Apple Studio in London.Madinger & Easter, p. 439. As a result of the problems associated with the Bangladesh project, author Peter Doggett writes, \\"[e]verything connected with the physical world seemed to annoy him.\\" The studio manager at the time,Doggett, p. 192. former Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick, recalls Harrison wearing his Hindu prayer bag and \\"mumbling away, chanting his mantra\\", often unable to reply to questions put to him.Emerick & Massey, p. 330. As for all the tracks on the album, the recording engineer on \\"The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)\\" was Phil McDonald, who had also worked in that capacity for the Beatles.Madinger & Easter, p. 462.Emerick & Massey, pp. 275, 318. The recording opens with Harrison's acoustic guitar and an electric piano riff that creates \\"a sense of foreboding\\", according to Inglis, who likens the intro to Three Dog Night's 1970 hit single \\"Mama Told Me Not to Come\\". Along with Harrison, the musicians on the basic track were Jim Keltner (drums), Nicky Hopkins (electric piano) and Klaus Voormann (bass).Spizer, p. 254. Part of Harrison's guide vocal from the basic track was retained for the official release.Madinger & Easter, p. 441. Among the overdubs, which were completed by the end of February 1973, Harrison added slide guitarMadinger & Easter, pp. 440, 441. and Jim Horn played various saxophone parts that Leng describes as \\"a straight lift from Harrison's favorite 'Savoy Truffle' model\\", with baritone saxophone prominent in the mix.Leng, pp. 37, 132. Assisting Horn on \\"The Lord Loves the One\\", Voormann played one of the tenor saxophone parts,Kevin Howlett's liner notes, booklet accompanying Living in the Material World reissue (EMI/Parlophone, 2006; produced by Dhani & Olivia Harrison), p. 11. a role he had recently provided on Harry Nilsson's Son of Schmilsson album (1972), to which Harrison and Hopkins also contributed.Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 115, 208, 220. Release and representation in album artwork Lyric insert artwork for the Material World album, taken from a Prabhupada-published version of the Bhagavad Gita Apple released Living in the Material World in May 1973 in the United States (June 1973 in Britain),Badman, p. 102. with \\"The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)\\" sequenced as the first track on side two of the LP.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 125. According to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, Harrison had considered an alternative running order, whereby the album opener, \\"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\\", began side two.Madinger & Easter, p. 440. The UK cassette format followed the latter sequence, which also placed \\"The Lord Loves the One\\" as the second track on side one, following \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\".\\"George Harrison – Living in the Material World (Cassette, Album)\\", Discogs (retrieved 1 June 2014). As with eight other songs on Material World, Harrison donated the copyright to \\"The Lord Loves the One\\" to the Material World Charitable Foundation,Schaffner, p. 160.Clayson, pp. 322–23. which he launched in April 1973Badman, p. 98. with a stated aim \\"to encourage the exploration of alternative life views and philosophies\\".Book accompanying Collaborations box set by Ravi Shankar and George Harrison (Dark Horse Records, 2010; produced by Olivia Harrison; package design by Drew Lorimer & Olivia Harrison), p. 32. Reflecting the lyrical content of songs such as \\"The Lord Loves the One\\" and \\"Living in the Material World\\",Woffinden, pp. 69–70.Tillery, pp. 111–12. Tom Wilkes's design for the album artwork contrasted a devout spiritual existence with life in the material world.Spizer, pp. 256, 258. The front of the inner-sleeve insert reproduced a painting from a Prabhupada-published edition of the Bhagavad Gita,Allison, p. 47. depicting Krishna and the warrior prince Arjuna driving a chariot. Part of this image was also used on the LP's side-one face label;Spizer, p. 256. in addition, it appeared opposite the words to \\"The Lord Loves the One\\" in the lyrics section of the Material World songbook, published by the Charles Hansen sheet music company.George Harrison Living in the Material World: Sheet Music for Piano, Vocal & Guitar, pp. 6–7. Writing in 1977, author Nicholas Schaffner described the combination of these \\"color representations of the Hindu scriptures\\" and the album-wide message espoused by Harrison in \\"The Lord Loves the One\\" as \\"a luxuriant rock devotional designed to transform his fans' stereo equipment into a temple\\".Schaffner, p. 159. In a 1982 interview with ISKCON's Mukunda Goswami, Harrison discussed the song's lyrics and referred to his use of the Krishna and Arjuna picture, along with the credit he gave Prabhupada's book, as a \\"plug\\" for the Hare Krishna movement.Chant and Be Happy, p. 20. Critical reception Contemporary reviews The song, if not the title alone, was a source of irritation for those critics who deemed Living in the Material World overly preachy and didactic.Leng, pp. 131, 132.Spizer, p. 255. In a full-page album review in Melody Maker, Michael Watts summarised his impression of Harrison's spiritual message: \\"One gets this feeling of George, somewhat remote and rarefied, indicting the world for being what it is, although if anybody could change the world it would be an old Beatle.\\"Michael Watts, \\"The New Harrison Album\\", Melody Maker, 9 June 1973, p. 3. While noting the song as an autobiographical statement on the singer's \\"struggle to retain personal dignity and peace of mind\\", Watts wrote: \\"He's dealing in lofty sentiments and abstractions; not everyone will want to drink of the cup.\\" In his 1973 album review for the NME, Tony Tyler described Material World as \\"so damn holy I could scream\\".Tony Tyler, \\"George Harrison: Living in the Material World (Apple)\\", NME, 9 June 1973, p. 33.Chris Hunt (ed.), NME Originals: Beatles – The Solo Years 1970–1980, IPC Ignite! (London, 2005), p. 70. Two years later, he and his Beatles: An Illustrated Record co-author Roy Carr remarked of Harrison's religious beliefs: \\"it's difficult to see why he travelled all the way to India to import a God who, by the sound of him ('The Lord Loves the One [That] Loves the Lord') is as intractable and selfish as the petulant Jehovah of Victorian Sunday schools.\\"Carr & Tyler, p. 107. To Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone, the track was \\"a compelling gospel-flavored rocker ... a stunning achievement that carries the authority of pop scripture\\".Stephen Holden, \\"George Harrison, Living in the Material World\\", Rolling Stone, 19 July 1973, p. 54 (retrieved 30 May 2014). On an album that he considered \\"a pop religious ceremony for all seasons, one in which Harrison acts as priest, deliberately placing his gifts and his legend into public service for God\\", Holden added of the song: \\"I hope that Aretha Franklin gets her hands on it, and soon.\\" Retrospective reviews and legacy Among reviewers in the 21st century, Zeth Lundy of PopMatters and Music Box editor John Metzger highlight \\"The Lord Loves the One\\" as one of the standout tracks on Living in the Material World.Zeth Lundy, \\"George Harrison: Living in the Material World\\", PopMatters, 8 November 2006 (retrieved 30 May 2014).John Metzger, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\", The Music Box, vol. 13 (11), November 2006 (retrieved 30 May 2014). As with \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\", Simon Leng sees the lyrics' spiritual framework as a distraction from the true message of the song, which in this case is the \\"bankruptcy\\" of the music business.Leng, pp. 131–32, 135. While noting that the media and anyone else associated with \\"the rock circus\\" had a vested interest in upholding its importance, Leng comments on the hostile reception afforded the song originally: \\"In 1973, no one dared point out that the emperor had no clothes on – except Harrison.\\"Leng, pp. 131–32. Author Robert Rodriguez describes \\"The Lord Loves the One\\" as \\"not the sanctimonious rant that some characterized it as\\", but a revelation of Harrison's inner conflict between his \\"earthly\\" status as a rock star and that role's \\"utter triviality in the Grand Scheme of things\\".Rodriguez, p. 157. Conversely, writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham finds the song's \\"'law says' finger-wagging\\" the exception on an album that otherwise \\"conveys his struggle\\" between the physical and spiritual worlds \\"with restraint and, in places, considerable grace and beauty\\",Ingham, p. 134. while former Mojo editor Mat Snow commented in 2006 of this and the majority of the songs on Material World: \\"The rest is Hari Georgeson at his most preachy, but it's never less than musical and often light on its feet.\\"Mat Snow, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\", Mojo, November 2006, p. 124. Also writing for Mojo, John Harris pairs \\"The Lord Loves the One\\" with \\"Give Me Love\\", as two tracks that support Material Worlds standing as \\"a Hindu concept album … a pleasing fusion of Eastern religion, gospel, and the ghost of 'For You Blue'\\".John Harris, \\"Beware of Darkness\\", Mojo, November 2011, p. 82. In his unfavourable assessment of the song, Ian Inglis contrasts it with the \\"impressive set of lyrics\\" on \\"Living in the Material World\\" and criticises Harrison for his \\"turgid proselytizing\\", which he likens to \\"the imprecations of an evangelical preacher\\".Inglis, pp. 40–41. Inglis concludes: \\"Harrison's impressive guitar work helps to compensate for the absence of a clear melody, but the song is ultimately undermined by some of his least-effective lyrics; the description of political leaders as 'big girls' is puerile and sexist.\\"Inglis, p. 41. Another Harrison biographer, Elliot Huntley, describes \\"The Lord Loves the One\\" as a \\"polished foot-tapper\\", on which \\"the drums push the song along nicely but the excessively wordy libretto somehow struggles to fit\\".Huntley, p. 93. Terry Staunton of Record Collector considers Living in the Material World to be \\"sloganeering with slide guitars\\" but lacking in any \\"out-and-out protest\\" message, such that \\"the more generalised, universally religious themes of The Lord Loves The One (That Loves The Lord) tend to sound a tad diluted.\\"Terry Staunton, \\"George Harrison Living In The Material World\\", Record Collector, December 2006, pp. 112, 113. Leng praises the track's musical accompaniment, highlighting Horn's sax arrangement and particularly Harrison's slide-guitar playing, which includes a solo that he views as \\"one of the best of his career\\". Similar sentiments come from Bruce Eder of AllMusic, who writes: \\"'The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)', despite its title, is the high point of the record, a fast, rollicking, funky, bluesy jewel with a priceless guitar break (maybe the best of Harrison's solo career) ...\\"Bruce Eder, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\", AllMusic (retrieved 30 May 2014). In a 2011 article for The Huffington Post, coinciding with the release of Martin Scorsese's documentary George Harrison: Living in the Material World, Steve Rabey describes Harrison as \\"perhaps the most explicitly and consistently theological rock star of the last half-century\\". Rabey refers to the song among Harrison's \\"mini-sermons illustrating Hindu concepts\\" (in this case, karma) and concludes: \\"While he failed to convert everyone to his beliefs, he nudged his [Beatles] bandmates – and his listener fans – a bit further to the East, encouraging audiences to open themselves to new (or very old) spiritual influences.\\"Steve Rabey, \\"George Harrison, 'Living In The Material World'\\", The Huffington Post, 9 October 2011 (retrieved 16 November 2014). Performance Harrison performed \\"The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)\\" at the start of his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar.Schaffner, p. 177. In addition to Jim Horn, the horn players on this live version were Tom Scott and Chuck Findley.Leng, p. 167. Consistent with his perception of an anti-stardom message in the song, Leng writes of there being an \\"immense [paradox]\\" in Harrison's attitude to this highly publicised tour, since: \\"here was one of the world's most famous musicians telling a leading writer from Rolling Stone that he'd 'gladly kiss it all good-bye' and purse his utterly sincere spiritual quest.\\"Leng, p. 166. On the first show of the tour, at Vancouver's Pacific Coliseum on 2 November, Harrison played the song following his opening instrumental, \\"Hari's on Tour (Express)\\".Madinger & Easter, pp. 447, 639. In Rolling Stone, Ben Fong-Torres began his feature article with the words \\"Holy Krishna! What kind of an opening night for George Harrison is this?\\",The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 125. before writing of Harrison's performance of \\"The Lord Loves the One\\": \\"he sang off key, and the voice, in its first flight, instantly sounded tired.\\"Ben Fong-Torres, \\"Lumbering in the Material World\\", Rolling Stone, 19 December 1974, p. 59. With Shankar's segments having been poorly received,Clayson, pp. 339, 340. Harrison then reworked the show's setlist, with the result that \\"The Lord Loves the One\\" and another Material World track, \\"Who Can See It\\", were dropped for the rest of the tour.Badman, p. 137.Madinger & Easter, p. 447. Leng writes of the song's removal as \\"a fate the heavy-funky arrangement did not deserve\\",Leng, p. 170. and Eder similarly considers that \\"The Lord Loves the One\\" belonged at \\"the heart\\" of any Harrison concert setlist. Later on during the West Coast leg of his 1974 tour,Badman, p. 138. Harrison donated the profits from one concert to the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic in San Francisco.Clayson, p. 334. As recorded in Fong-Torres's article, Harrison then visited the clinic and sang the chorus of \\"The Lord Loves the One\\" to the grateful staff, as a way to illustrate his point: \\"Don't thank me ... it's something else over us that acts through people like me. I'm just an instrument.\\" Personnel *George Harrison – vocals, acoustic guitar, slide guitars, backing vocals *Nicky Hopkins – electric piano *Klaus Voormann – bass, tenor saxophone *Jim Keltner – drums, percussion *Jim Horn – saxophones, horn arrangement Notes References Sources * Dale C.

The lyrics reflect Harrison's uneasy feelings towards the Beatles' legacy, three years after the group's break-up, and serve as his statement of independence from expectations raised by the band's unprecedented popularity. Some music critics and biographers suggest that he wrote the song during a period of personal anguish, following the acclaim he had received as a solo artist with the 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass and his 1971–72 Bangladesh aid project. The revelatory nature of the lyrics has encouraged comparisons between Living in the Material World and John Lennon's primal therapy-inspired 1970 release, Plastic Ono Band. A dramatic ballad in the Roy Orbison vein, the composition features unusual changes in time signature and a melody that incorporates musical tension. Harrison self-produced the recording, which includes heavy orchestration and a choir, both arranged by John Barham. Several commentators consider Harrison's vocal performance on \\"Who Can See It\\" to be among the finest of his career, while his production style has been likened to that of Beatles producer George Martin. The other musicians on the track are Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann, Jim Keltner and Gary Wright. Among reviews of the song, \\"Who Can See It\\" has been described variously as an \\"aching, yearning masterpiece\\",Huntley, p. 92. a \\"song which goes on far too long to make its simple point\\", and an \\"unequivocal statement\\" on Harrison's identity. In line with his self-image as a musician, regardless of his past as a Beatle, Harrison included \\"Who Can See It\\" in the setlist for his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar, the first tour there by a former Beatle since the band's break-up. Background and inspiration The Beatles (with Harrison third from left) in 1964, during the height of Beatlemania As with the majority of the songs on his Living in the Material World album, George Harrison wrote \\"Who Can See It\\" over 1971–72. In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, he makes light of the emotion behind the song, describing it as simply \\"a true story meaning 'Give us a break, squire'\\".Harrison, p. 238. Simon Leng, Harrison's musical biographer, recognises the song as a statement of considerable personal anguish, however.Leng, pp. 129–30, 137, 156. He writes of Harrison having been \\"deeply traumatized\\" by the effects of the Beatles' unprecedented popularity, and equally disoriented by his success as a solo artist following their break-up in April 1970.Leng, pp. 129, 138. According to Leng, Harrison was in the same state of internal conflict over 1972–73 as John Lennon had been when writing the song \\"Help!\\" in 1965,Leng, p. 138. during his self-styled \\"fat Elvis period\\".MacDonald, p. 136. Music critic Stephen Holden highlighted a similar comparison between the two ex-Beatles in July 1973,Rodriguez, pp. 155–56. when he deemed Living in the Material World to be \\"as personal and confessional\\" as Lennon's primal therapy-inspired Plastic Ono Band album (1970).Stephen Holden, \\"George Harrison, Living in the Material World\\", Rolling Stone, 19 July 1973, p. 54 (retrieved 17 February 2014). During the Beatles' career, Harrison had been the first to tire of Beatlemania and the group's celebrity status,The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 33–34. and he had written songs rejecting what Leng terms the \\"artifice\\" surrounding the band.Leng, p. 86. Lennon himself described the Beatles' predicament as \\"four individuals who eventually recovered their individualities after being submerged in a myth\\".Peter Doggett, \\"Fight to the Finish\\", Mojo Special Limited Edition: 1000 Days of Revolution (The Beatles' Final Years – Jan 1, 1968 to Sept 27, 1970), Emap (London, 2003), p. 140. In addition, for Harrison, while he began to match Lennon and Paul McCartney as a songwriter towards the end of the group's career,Lavezzoli, p. 185.\\"George Harrison Biography\\", rollingstone.com (archived version retrieved 31 October 2017). his relatively junior position in the Beatles was a source of frustration to him,Greene, pp. 45, 53. which, according to music journalist Mikal Gilmore, left \\"deep and lasting wounds\\".The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 39. Aside from being released from the psychological pressure of being a Beatle in 1970,MacDonald, p. 300.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 33. Harrison was the one who potentially benefited the most from the group's break-up.Anthony DeCurtis, \\"George Harrison All Things Must Pass\\", Rolling Stone, 12 October 2000 (archived version retrieved 17 February 2014).Schaffner, p. 140. His 1970 triple album, All Things Must Pass, was a major commercial and critical success,Peter Doggett, \\"The Apple Years\\", Record Collector, April 2001, pp. 36, 37. eclipsing releases by both Lennon and McCartney.Woffinden, p. 39.Lambert Ramirez, \\"George Harrison: The not-so-quiet Beatle\\", philstar.com, 17 March 2014 (retrieved 14 October 2015). According to author Ian Inglis, Harrison became \\"popular music's first statesman\\" as a result of both All Things Must Pass and his 1971–72 Bangladesh aid project.Inglis, p. 36. The last of these established humanitarianism as a new direction for rock music,Tillery, p. 100.Rodriguez, pp. 41, 49, 51. in addition to focusing on Harrison the level of attention previously afforded the Beatles.Bruce Eder, \\"George Harrison\\", AllMusic (archived version retrieved 31 October 2017).Clayson, p. 318. While Leng describes \\"Who Can See It\\" as a \\"plea for understanding from a private man living his life in public\\", Inglis writes that, after the \\"euphoria\\" of his recent achievements as a solo artist, Harrison was forced to confront \\"some of the more unpleasant realities of his everyday life\\".Inglis, p. 37. Composition \\"Who Can See It\\" is in the musical key of E. The melody incorporates various augmented and diminished chords,\\"Who Can See It\\", in George Harrison Living in the Material World: Sheet Music for Piano, Vocal & Guitar, Charles Hansen (New York, NY, 1973), p. 72. which Harrison describes in I, Me, Mine as \\"all kinds of suspended chords\\", since he played them in an open tuning on the guitar. The song starts with a solitary guitar figure and then builds in intensity through the verse and into the chorus, as musical tension matches the emotion of the lyrics. Leng views \\"Who Can See It\\" as a \\"new type of ballad\\" from Harrison, one that combines a \\"dramatic edge\\" with rhythmic sophistication.Leng, p. 129. The time signature shifts throughout the composition, from 4/4 to 6/4 and 5/8, with brief portions in 5/4 and 3/4.\\"Who Can See It\\", in George Harrison Living in the Material World: Sheet Music for Piano, Vocal & Guitar, Charles Hansen (New York, NY, 1973), pp. 27–29. In Leng's description, the melody features \\"sweepingly large chromatic intervals\\", beginning with the verse's third line – a four-semitone swoop that recalls the ascending melismas commonly used in Indian music. Harrison later remarked, with reference to the boldness of the tune: \\"['Who Can See It'] reminds me of Roy Orbison for some reason. He could do this good.\\" Among the material Harrison wrote or finished for Living in the Material World, several songs reflect on his years with the Beatles,Leng, p. 126. and in the case of \\"Who Can See It\\", with bitterness.Allison, p. 159.Rodriguez, p. 156. In the opening verse, he states:Harrison, p. 237. Inglis views these lines as a reference to Harrison's working-class upbringing as well as his years as a member of the Beatles. In the chorus that follows, Harrison contends that, having personally lived through these experiences, his sole wish is that his feelings \\"Should not be denied me now\\", and he concludes: \\"I can see my life belongs to me / My love belongs to who can see it.\\"Song lyrics and commentary, booklet accompanying Living in the Material World reissue (EMI Records, 2006; produced by Dhani & Olivia Harrison), p. 22. Inglis offers a simple précis of this statement: \\"he has paid his dues. Now he is his own man ...\\"Inglis, p. 40. In the song's second verse, Harrison sings of having \\"lived in fear\\" and witnessed the hatred created by \\"this sad world\\". While later discussing his aversion to performing live after 1966, Harrison presented a similar imagery, citing the Beatles' concerns regarding the threat of assassination.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 33. He also referred to the band's fame as \\"very one- sided\\", since the Beatles \\"gave their nervous systems\\" while receiving the adulation of their fans.The Beatles, p. 354. Leng finds the words to verse two typical of Harrison's tendency towards \\"internalization of world events\\" in some of his songs from this period, whereby \\"hate, conflict and strife\\" are projected onto the \\"wider world\\" in the likes of \\"Who Can See It\\" and \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\".Leng, p. 130. Theologian Dale Allison views the mention of \\"this sad world\\" as a further reference to the essentially \\"tragic\\" nature of human existence, after \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and in anticipation of later Harrison songs such as \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\", in that \\"notwithstanding all the success and adulation\\", ultimately, \\"we are all alone\\".Allison, pp. 117–18. Allison writes of the message behind \\"Who Can See It\\": \\"Here he declares his freedom from his Beatle past, his freedom to be himself.\\" Recording Harrison had intended to co-produce his long-awaited follow-up to All Things Must Pass with Phil Spector, a mainstay of his career since 1970.Madinger & Easter, p. 439.Timothy White, \\"George Harrison – Reconsidered\\", Musician, November 1987, p. 53. Spector's unreliability meant that Harrison was forced to produce Living in the Material World alone – an outcome that music critics Greg Kot and Zeth Lundy find regrettable, in light of how Spector's signature Wall of Sound treatment might have suited ballads such as \\"Who Can See It\\" and \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\". Another regular Harrison collaborator, John Barham, provided orchestral arrangements as before,Huntley, p. 90. and noted an \\"austere quality\\" in some of the new songs.Leng, p. 137. \\"George was under stress during Living in the Material World,\\" Barham said later. \\"I felt that he was going through some kind of a crisis. I think it may have been spiritual, but I cannot be sure.\\" Roy Orbison, whose vocal style Harrison emulated on \\"Who Can See It\\" Harrison taped the basic track for \\"Who Can See It\\" between October and December 1972,Badman, p. 83. either at the Beatles' Apple Studio in London or at FPSHOT, his home studio in Henley, Oxfordshire.Spizer, p. 254. He recorded his vocals during the first two months of the new year,Badman, pp. 83, 89. and Barham's orchestration and choir were added in late February.Madinger & Easter, pp. 439, 440. Harrison's twin electric-guitar parts recall the sound of the Beatles' Abbey Road album, through his use of a Leslie rotary effect – a detail that Leng finds significant, given the song's subject matter. In another Beatles comparison, music journalists Alan Clayson and John Metzger consider Harrison's production on Material World to be similar to George Martin's work with the band.Clayson, p. 323.John Metzger, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\", The Music Box, vol. 13 (11), November 2006 (retrieved 17 February 2014). Leng writes of \\"Who Can See It\\" having been \\"conceived with an Orbison vocal\\",Leng, p. 259. and the singing duly reflects Orbison's more dramatic style. Harrison's vocal reaches falsetto in places, while, in Clayson's description, \\"swerving from muttered trepidation to strident intensity\\" during the course of the song. Aside from Harrison, the musicians on the recording include Nicky Hopkins (piano), Klaus Voormann (bass) and Jim Keltner (drums). As can be heard in the outtake of \\"Who Can See It\\" available unofficially on the Living in the Alternate World bootleg,\\"George Harrison – Living in the Alternate World\\", Bootleg Zone (retrieved 17 February 2014). Gary Wright's original contribution was a prominent harmonium part, superseded by Barham's strings and brass on the released version.Madinger & Easter, p. 441. Leng nevertheless credits Wright with playing organ on the song. Release and reception Apple Records released Living in the Material World at the end of May 1973 in the United States and a month later in Britain.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 125.Badman, p. 102. \\"Who Can See It\\" appeared as track 5 on side one of the LP format,Spizer, p. 253. in between what Leng terms the \\"perfect pop confection\\" \\"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\\"Leng, pp. 128–29. and another song that referenced Harrison's Beatle past, \\"Living in the Material World\\".Rodriguez, p. 157.Lindsay Planer, \\"George Harrison 'Living in the Material World'\\", AllMusic (retrieved 17 February 2014). Reflecting the album's lyrical themes,Huntley, p. 89. Tom Wilkes's art design contrasted a devout spiritual existence with life in the material world, by featuring Hindu religious images such as a painting of Krishna and his warrior prince Arjuna, and a photograph of Harrison and his fellow musicians at a banquet,Spizer, pp. 256, 258. surrounded by symbols of material wealth and success.Woffinden, pp. 69–70. The album confirmed Harrison's status as the most commercially successful ex-Beatle,Rodriguez, p. 263. but it drew criticism from some reviewers for the number of slow songs among its eleven tracks, as well as the perceived preachy tone of Harrison's lyrics.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 44. According to author Michael Frontani, lines such as \\"My life belongs to me\\" in \\"Who Can See It\\" \\"betrayed sentiments of a man increasingly at odds … with fans and critics who wanted him to be 'Beatle George,' or at least to be less fixated on his spirituality\\".Frontani, p. 159. In his review for Rolling Stone, Stephen Holden wrote that, amid Material Worlds \\"miraculous ... radiance\\", the song represented \\"passionate testament\\" and \\"a beautiful ballad whose ascendant long-line melody is the most distinguished of the album\\". In Melody Maker, Michael Watts described Living in the Material World as \\"far, far removed from the Beatles\\" and \\"more interesting\\" lyrically than All Things Must Pass. Watts noted the \\"large autobiographical insights\\" provided in Harrison's songwriting, of which \\"Who Can See It\\" showed \\"he's found the way at last\\".Michael Watts, \\"The New Harrison Album\\", Melody Maker, 9 June 1973, p. 3. Writing of Harrison's standing on an album he considered \\"as personal, in its own way, as anything that Lennon has done\\": Watts said: \\"Harrison has always struck me before as simply a writer of very classy pop songs; now he stands as something more than an entertainer. Now he's being honest.\\" NME critic Bob Woffinden praised the song also, but suggested it was \\"ideal material\\" for someone with a wider vocal range than Harrison.Woffinden, p. 71. Retrospective reviews Some recent reviewers have been less enthusiastic, with PopMatters' Zeth Lundy opining that, rather than Harrison's more \\"stripped-down\\" production aesthetic, \\"Who Can See It\\" would have benefited from \\"the hyper-drama of All Things Must Pass resonant abyss\\".Zeth Lundy, \\"George Harrison: Living in the Material World\\", PopMatters, 8 November 2006 (retrieved 17 February 2014). Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002, Greg Kot similarly bemoaned the \\"hymn-like calm\\" of the performance and its falling short of the \\"transcendent heights\\" of Harrison's 1970 triple set.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 188. In their Solo Beatles Compendium, Chip Madinger and Mark Easter dismiss the track as a \\"song which goes on far too long to make its simple point\\", a situation not helped by a \\"histrionic\\" vocal from Harrison. Reviewing the 2006 reissue of Living in the Material World for Q magazine, Tom Doyle included it among the album's best three tracks and wrote: \\"the introspective moods of The Light That Has Lighted The World and Who Can See It, with their ornate instrumentation and weepy vocals, are lovely things.\\"Tom Doyle, \\"George Harrison Living in the Material World\\", Q, November 2006, p. 156. Former Mojo editor Mat Snow describes Material World as \\"a treat for the ears\\" and, while conceding Harrison's limitations as a singer compared with Lennon and McCartney, he writes that Harrison \\"worked hard to ensure the choruses of ... 'Who Can See It' caught the ear with their deep and delicious emotion\\".Snow, p. 39. In his review of the 2014 reissue of Harrison's Apple catalogue, for Classic Rock, Paul Trynka refers to Material Word as an album that \\"sparkles with many gems\\"; of these, he adds, \\"it's the more restrained tracks – Don't Let Me Wait Too Long, Who Can See It – that entrance: gorgeous pop songs, all the more forceful for their restraint.\\"Paul Trynka, \\"George Harrison: The Apple Years 1968–75\\", TeamRock, 8 October 2014 (retrieved 27 November 2014).Paul Trynka, \\"George Harrison The Apple Years 1968–75\\", Classic Rock, November 2014, p. 105. New Zealand Herald journalist Graham Reid writes of Harrison \\"sound[ing] battered by recent events and the Beatle legacy\\" on \\"Who Can See It\\", yet he cites the song as a \\"standout\\" on an album that \\"can be very moving\\".Graham Reid, \\"George Harrison Revisited, Part One (2014): The dark horse bolting out of the gate\\", Elsewhere, 24 October 2014 (retrieved 10 October 2015). Among Beatles biographers, the Roy Orbison influence in \\"Who Can See It\\" is frequently noted, as is the fact that Harrison's lead vocal is one of the best of his career.Clayson, p. 324. In addition to admiring the album's disciplined, George Martin-like production, Alan Clayson has written of the \\"hitherto unprecedented audacity\\" of the vocals found throughout Material World, adding: \\"He may have lacked the Big O's operatic pitch, but 'Who Can See It' was among George's most magnificent performances on record. Veering cleanly into falsetto on other tracks, too, never had his pipes been so adept.\\"Clayson, pp. 323, 324. Elliot Huntley describes \\"Who Can See It\\" as a \\"beautiful ballad\\" and an \\"aching, yearning masterpiece\\". In his chapter on George Harrison in the book The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, Peter Lavezzoli is another who highlights Harrison's singing on this \\"gorgeous Roy Orbison-esque ballad\\".Lavezzoli, p. 195. While praising a vocal that \\"positively bursts with passion\\", Leng identifies the song's \\"prevailing emotions\\" as \\"bitterness and anger\\" and notes: \\"If any Beatles fan was laboring under the misapprehension that George had enjoyed the [Beatles] episode as much as they had, this song tells the exact opposite story.\\" Ian Inglis writes that the \\"rather ponderous\\" arrangement on \\"Who Can See It\\" limits its \\"entertainment\\" value but, like \\"The Light That Has Lighted the World\\", the song is an \\"unequivocal statement of who he is\\". Live performance In line with his stated refusal to play the role of \\"Beatle George\\" at the time,Schaffner, p. 178.Rodriguez, pp. 237–38. \\"Who Can See It\\" was among the songs rehearsed and played on Harrison's North American tour with Ravi Shankar in November–December 1974.Badman, p. 137.Leng, pp. 129, 166, 169. Given the composition's \\"intensity of sentiment\\", Leng views it as a notable inclusion in the concert setlist. Harrison dropped the song in a program reshuffle following the opening show, however, due to his laryngitis- ravaged vocals cords being unable to carry such a demanding tune.Leng, p. 170.Madinger & Easter, pp. 441, 447. The tour was the first North American tour by an ex-Beatle, a fact that encouraged expectations from many critics and concert-goers that were at odds with Harrison's aimLeng, p. 166. – which was to present a musically diverse show featuring a minimum of his Beatles-era songs.Rodriguez, pp. 59–60. In an attempt to justify himself, Harrison took to quoting from the chorus of \\"Who Can See It\\" during interviews,The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 44, 125. as an example of Gandhi's advice to \\"create and preserve the image of your choice\\".Greene, p. 215.Clayson, p. 337.

Overview The undersea megathrust earthquake was 9.1 to 9.3 on the moment magnitude scale and struck the Indian Ocean off the western coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia. It occurred on 26 December 2004 at 00:58:50 UTC (07:58:50 local time in Jakarta and Bangkok). Finnish citizens in the affected regions There were approximately 2300 Finnish citizens on package tours in Thailand, and 600 in Sri Lanka, at the time of the earthquake. The number of independent travellers has not been confirmed. By 31 May 2005, a total number of 179 Finns have been proclaimed dead as caused by the tsunami; as of October 2006, one adult and three children were still officially missing in the affected areas. One person went missing in Sri Lanka and 178 in Thailand. Eight Finnish casualties had resided in Phuket island, and 170 in Khao Lak beach, which was the area in Thailand hardest hit by the catastrophe. 106 Finns went missing from the hotel Blue Village Pakarang in Khao Lak. Among the dead were an executive from Finland's Pfizer, Harriet Eckstein, and a popular rock and jazz musician, Aki Sirkesalo. Among those who escaped was the future President of Finland, Sauli Niinistö, who saved himself from the tsunami wave by climbing onto a lamppost with his two sons in Khao Lak. Finnish government officials' actions The Finnish government officials were heavily criticised for their slow response to help those citizens affected by the events. There were a high number of travellers in the affected areas in need of information on lost relatives, help to find travel documents to get back home, and generally in need to get evacuated in an organised manner. In Finland, thousands of relatives needed information regarding family members that may have been in the area. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received the most criticism, mostly by not providing enough emergency telephone services during Boxing Day and the days following. One of the reasons for the government's slow response, as has been claimed, was the general lack of information about the situation, and the lack of readiness to organise evacuation efforts in politically stable foreign locations. In Sweden, the country in Europe with the highest number of casualties as a result of the tsunami, widespread criticism towards the government led to the resignations of top politicians, but these consequences didn't occur in Finland. Diver instructors in rescue efforts In response for the need to coordinate rescue and evacuation efforts for Finnish people in Thailand, a group of Finnish scuba divers started collecting namelists of the ones missing and the ones in safe locations, and sending them as text messages to the homeland to be published in lists in the Sukellus.fi website. This operation was led by entrepreneurs Janne Miikkulainen and Jani Mäkinen from Raya Divers, a scuba diving firm based in Phuket, and by internet entrepreneur Alex Nieminen and journalist Petri Ahoniemi in Helsinki. Miikkulainen, Mäkinen and a crew of tourist agents also circulated hospitals and evacuation centers around Khao Lak and Phuket in order to find Finnish people and give them information about the situation. Janne Miikkulainen was awarded a Cross of Merit of the Order of the Lion of Finland for his work during and after the catastrophe. The others hosting the Sukellus.fi-website received a State information award.

Long and his book - a pamphlet [1903], p. 3 – 1952) was an American writer, naturalist and minister. He lived and worked in Stamford, Connecticut as a minister of the First Congregationalist Church. As a naturalist, he would leave Stamford every March, often with his son, Brian, and two daughters, Lois and Cesca, to travel to \\"the wilderness\\" of Maine. There they would stay until the first snows of October, although sometimes he would stay all winter. In the 1920s, he began spending his summers in Nova Scotia, claiming \\"the wilderness is getting too crowded\\". He wrote of these wilderness experiences in the books Ways of Wood Folk, Wilderness Ways, Wood-folk Comedies, Northern Trails, Wood Folk at School, and many others. His earlier books were illustrated by Charles Copeland; two later ones were illustrated by Charles Livingston Bull. Long believed that the best way to experience the wild was to \\"plant yourself and sit for hours on end to let the wild come to you; and they will!\\"  Controversy  Because of the increased public interest in the natural world as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution, Rev. Long's books were finding a large audience and even being issued in schools under the title of The Wood Folk Series. However, his findings and observations clashed with the prevailing scientific wisdom of animal behavior, which believed animals behaved purely on instinct, and could not learn from experience: a bird builds a nest purely by instinct and is not taught the skills required. Rev. Long provided many examples, supposedly from his experience, to cast doubt on that prevailing wisdom, suggesting that in fact animals did learn, and each could become individuals within their species. Some of the more famous observations were that kingfishers would catch fish in a river and then drop them into small pools so their offspring could practice catching the same fish but in an easier environment. He also chronicled a woodcock that made a \\"splint\\" for its broken leg. He also wrote of foxes that rode on the backs of sheep to escape hunters and porcupines curling into balls and rolling down hills. All this led to a belief that Rev. Long (and others) were anthropomorphizing animal behavior, blurring the lines between the animal world and humans. This came to a head when President Teddy Roosevelt's naturalist adviser, John Burroughs, accused Rev. Long (and others) of gross exaggeration, if not outright lies, regarding his books and the reflections of nature therein. Roosevelt wrote \\"If he stated that he had seen a weasel kill a deer and then carry it to the top of a pine tree, I would not care how many affidavits he produced, because the feat would be mechanically impossible.\\" Long thus found himself at the center of the nature fakers controversy of the early 1900s. Ultimately Burroughs claimed Rev. Long was trying to sell books to gullible readers with such lies and President Theodore Roosevelt himself had Rev. Long's books taken from all school libraries. The local Stamford paper chronicled the feud with \\"our dashing Rev. Long\\". Rev. Long would counter that you cannot \\"understand nature when you have a gun on your hip, ride on top of a wagon or horseback, and have a crowd of twenty with you,\\" taking aim at Teddy Roosevelt's much publicized and photographed forays into nature. He went so far to state Roosevelt \\"never met an animal he didn't kill.\\" After a couple months back and forth in the Stamford and national papers, Rev. Long said that \\"while obviously we cannot settle this through the media, I invite President Roosevelt anytime to Stamford to settle this like men.\\" Roosevelt never accepted his invitation.

Family His wife Dorothy Harmsen was born on September 3, 1914 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and died on August 29, 2006 of a heart attack at age 91. They had three children. Jolly Rancher The couple moved to Denver, Colorado in 1942. In 1949 they opened a candy store in Golden, Colorado called the Jolly Rancher named after the Jolly Farmer, a depression era general store selling hard candies in their hometown of Minneapolis. Unhappy with local candy suppliers, they decided to make their own candy, which led to the creation of Jolly Rancher candy. The Harmsens ran a very successful company for almost 21 years before selling it to Beatrice Foods in 1966, with Bill Harmsen residing as president until 1977. The company was purchased by Hershey in 1996, and Jolly Rancher has become one of America's favorite hard candies with over a dozen flavors and millions sold since their creation. Life After the Jolly Rancher After his leaving the business, the Harmsens became even more involved in collecting Western Art. Some of the pieces in their collection included works by artists such as Alfred Miller, George Catlin, Joseph H. Sharp, Victor Higgins, Frederic Remington, and Robert Henri. Later in life, they donated tracts of land to the Golden Gate Canyon State Park in Colorado. In 2001, the couple donated close to 5,000 pieces of art and American West memorabilia to the Denver Art Museum. He died of prostate cancer in 2002, aged 89.

The band was signed to Nuclear Blast and have released four full-length albums through the label. Their final album, This Is Where It Ends, was released on July 26, 2011. All Shall Perish are noted for being one of the earliest pioneering bands in the deathcore genre. History Formation and Nuclear Blast signing (2002–2008) All Shall Perish was founded in 2002 from the former members of the San Francisco Bay Area bands Antagony, End of All, and Boof. The founding members were Matt Kuykendall, Ben Orum, Mike Tiner, Caysen Russo, and Craig Betit. The band released their demo in 2003 and caught the attention of Japanese label Amputated Vein Records. On August 19, 2003, they released their debut album Hate, Malice, Revenge, which was re-released by Nuclear Blast in 2005. In 2006, The Price of Existence was released, whose first single, \\"Eradication,\\" was made into a video and played on MTV2's Headbanger's Ball. A viral video of the song \\"There Is No Business to Be Done On a Dead Planet\\" set to the boy-band 'N Sync's video for \\"Bye Bye Bye\\" helped to garner a new fanbase for the band. The group released their third studio album, Awaken the Dreamers, on September 16, 2008, through Nuclear Blast. It debuted at number 126 on the Billboard 200 and number 1 on the Top Heatseekers charts, with 5,500 copies sold in its first week. Guitarist Caysen Russo and vocalist Craig Betit only appear on the band's first studio album, and were replaced by Chris Storey and Hernan \\"Eddie\\" Hermida, respectively. All Shall Perish completed several successful tours across America in 2006, and they were also on The Darkness Over Europe 2007 tour. Bray Almini (Suffokate) occasionally filled in for Mike Tiner on bass during tours. In September 2008, they toured parts of Russia and became the first all-American metal band to tour Siberia, playing shows in Irkutsk, Novosibirsk, Tomsk, and Omsk. The band was also part of the European leg of the Hell On Earth Tour 2008. On November 11, 2008, the band recorded the video to their single \\"Never... Again,\\" directed by Gary Smithson, in downtown Los Angeles. Line-up changes (2009–2010) On February 5, 2009, All Shall Perish stated on their website that they were parting ways with guitarist Chris Storey and replacing him with Jason Richardson. The band issued the following statement: \\"We will be doing all upcoming tours and fests! We have an unbelievable replacement named Jason Richardson. Can't wait to see everyone on the road! We will be doing a small headliner, the Atticus Clothing tour and then a ton of major fests in Europe. We have some surprises in store as well!\\" After finishing the Night of the Living Shred Tour, All Shall Perish returned to California where they began writing a new album. Mike Tiner stated that the process was \\"going slow, very slow.\\" In early 2010, Richardson left All Shall Perish to join Born of Osiris. On June 5, 2010, the band announced a new line- up. Drummer Matt Kuykendall, one of the founding members, was replaced by Adam Pierce (formerly of Sea of Treachery) and Francesco Artusato (Hiss of Atrocities) became the new lead guitar player, the band's third. The only original member remaining is Mike Tiner. This Is Where It Ends (2010–2015) On the November 8, 2010, the band announced they were starting work on a new album. Guitarist Ben Orum said on the band's official website, \\"After two very successful tours at home and abroad, we are now home writing the new All Shall Perish record! The writing process is flowing very naturally, and so far the material itself is very impressive. It is safe to say this will be one of the most aggressive, epic, groovy records we have ever written. I cannot wait to start playing this material live.\\" On January 31, 2011, the band was announced to be billed on the fourth annual Mayhem Festival, playing on the Revolver Stage alongside other metal acts including Suicide Silence, Machine Head, Straight Line Stitch, and Testament. Their fourth full-length album, titled This Is Where It Ends, was released on July 26, 2011, in United States and July 29, 2011, in Europe. A legal organization named World Digital filed suit on April 20, 2012, against 80 fans for $150,000 for allegedly using BitTorrent to download this album. This action by the company was done without the band's permission or knowledge, and as a result All Shall Perish sided with their fans against the lawsuit. The lawsuit was dropped by request of the band. Hermida joined Suicide Silence on October 3, 2013, which was officially announced on the Suicide Silence Facebook page. On October 4, All Shall Perish released a statement about Hermida leaving, confirming that the band would continue. An interview with Mike Tiner on the Metal Injection website stated that Mike Tiner's position was that Hermida chose to leave by not being able to commit to the band.  Return of original lineup and disbandment (2015–2020)  On October 21, 2015, All Shall Perish announced the return of Hernan \\"Eddie\\" Hermida and guitarist Chris Storey, alongside founding members Matt Kuykendall, Ben Orum, and Caysen Russo, now on bass. The group's press release noted that original vocalist Craig Betit will participate in some fashion as well. The band stated that bassist Mike Tiner, the last original member in the lineup before the return of Orum, Kuykendall, and Russo declined a personal invitation to participate. Francesco Artusato and drummer Adam Pierce are no longer part of the band. On April 21, 2020, vocalist Hernan \\"Eddie\\" Hermida announced that the reunion was no longer happening. Musical style and lyrical themes Influences Much of the band is influenced by European metal, particularly Swedish death metal. Their influences are by a large number of groups, including Opeth, Cannibal Corpse, At the Gates, Dying Fetus, Irate, Tenacious D, Blood Has Been Shed, Hatebreed, The Beatles, Journey, Michael Jackson, Queen, The Police, Harry Belafonte, Rusty Cooley, GWAR, Dissection, Dimmu Borgir, Carcass, Pantera and many others. Lyrics The band's lyrics consist of several different themes, including politics, such as government control, fascism, corporate control, and organised religion. For example, the song \\"Black Gold Reign\\" from Awaken the Dreamers references countries around the world adopting oil as the main source of currency. A majority of their songs are politically based.interview with Hernan \\"Eddie\\" Hermida (All Shall Perish) Zolireds Although rare, the band wrote a few songs on personal subjects such as the song \\"In This Life of Pain\\" from the album This Is Where It Ends, and the song \\"Deconstruction,\\" from the album Hate, Malice, Revenge, which was written about original vocalist Craig Betit's ex-girlfriend.

They have been featured in various short story collections, including The Boats of the \\"Glen Carrig\\" and Other Nautical Adventures: The Collected Fiction of William Hope Hodgson, Volume 1. In his introduction to this volume, the editor Jeremy Lassen writes: > [These stories] are the kind of stories that helped Hodgson achieve > commercial success. These stories were often published in the highest paying > fiction markets of his day, and demonstrate his wide-ranging narrative > talent... Today's readers of Hodgson may be more familiar with his > stunningly original novels of cosmic vision, such as The House on the > Borderland or The Night Land, but it is his narratives of the sea that first > captured the attention of the reading public.

This story contains several similarities to Hodgson's novel The Boats of the \\"Glen Carrig\\". Both concern a vessel trapped in the Sargasso Sea, which builds a superstructure against attacking creatures; the trapped ship in the novel is the Seabird, while the ship in this story is called the Homebird. The story can be thought of as a shorter but similar tale told from the perspective of a character trapped aboard such a ship. Plot summary A sailing ship happens to fall upon a floating water-cask, well-sealed with pitch and containing a manuscript. The cask is opened and the manuscript is read aloud. It is the story of the ship Homebird. A terrible storm at sea heavily damages the ship, breaking away all three masts and severely injuring the captain, and leaving it at the mercy of the winds and tides until it is caught in the \\"cemetery of the oceans,\\" the Sargasso Sea. A group of crew members attempts to free the Homebird but are taken by a giant octopus. The remaining crewmen are also killed, leaving only the narrator, the injured captain, and the captain's daughter. As the captain's health fails, the narrator constructs a superstructure out of wood and pitch-hardened canvas to protect the vessel from the predator. The captain realizes that he will soon die, leaving the narrator alone with his daughter. To protect her honor, the narrator agrees to marry the young woman. :\\"'Do you -- do you love her?' :\\"His tone was keenly wistful, and a sense of trouble lurked in his eyes. :\\"'She will be my wife,' I said, simply; and he nodded. :\\"'God has dealt strangely with us,' he murmured, presently, as though to himself. :\\"Abruptly, he bade me tell her to come in. :\\"And then he married us. :\\"Three days later, he was dead, and we were alone. The narrator continues to fortify the ship's defenses, and soon finds that his new wife is pregnant. He takes stock of the ship's stores of food and finds that sufficient provisions exist to keep them alive for fifteen to seventeen years. The narrator of the story within a story concludes by describing his plans to enclose the manuscript in the water-cask and attach it to a balloon, so that the wind will carry it to open water. The narrative returns from the story-within-a-story to describe the present captain's reaction to the story: > \\"Seventeen years pervisions,\\" he muttered thoughtfully. \\"An' this 'ere were > written sumthin' like twenty-nine years ago!\\" He nodded his head several > times. \\"Poor creetures!\\" he exclaimed. \\"It'd be er long while, Jock -- a > long while!\\" \\"From the Tideless Sea Part Two: Further News of the Homebird\\" \\"The Mystery of the Derelict\\" \\"The Thing in the Weeds\\" \\"The Finding of the Graiken\\" A man abuses his friend's trust by taking over his ship and sailing on a mission to the Sargasso Sea to rescue his girlfriend. \\"The Call in the Dawn\\" Category:British short story collections Category:Single-writer short story collections Category:Short stories by William Hope Hodgson Category:Fictional works set in the Atlantic Ocean ","title":"Sargasso Sea Stories"},{"id":"6890884","text":"The United States National Research Council conducts a survey and compiles a report on United States Research-Doctorate Programs approximately every 10 years, although the time elapsed between each new ranking has exceeded 10 years.

Chronic atrophic rhinitis may be primary and secondary. Special forms of chronic atrophic rhinitis are rhinitis sicca anterior and ozaena. It can also be described as empty nose syndrome. Signs and symptoms * It is most commonly seen in females * It is reported among patients from lower socioeconomic groups. * The nasal cavities become roomy and are filled with foul smelling crusts which are black or dark green and dry, making expiration painful and difficult. * Microorganisms are known to multiply and produce a foul smell from the nose, though the patients may not be aware of this, because the nerve endings(responsible for the perception of smell) have become atrophied. This is called merciful anosmia. * Patients usually complain of nasal obstruction despite the roomy nasal cavity, which can be caused either by the obstruction produced by the discharge in the nose, or as a result of sensory loss due to atrophy of nerves in the nose, so the patient is unaware of the air flow. In the case of the second cause, the sensation of obstruction is subjective. * Bleeding from the nose, also called epistaxis, may occur when the dried discharge (crusts) are removed. * Septal perforation and dermatitis of nasal vestibule can occur. The nose may show a saddle-nose deformity. * Atrophic rhinitis is also associated with similar atrophic changes in the pharynx or larynx, producing symptoms pertaining to these structures. Hearing impairment can occur due to Eustachian tube blockage causing middle ear effusion. Permanent loss of smell and impairment of taste may also be a result of this disease, even after the symptoms are cured.  Etiology  Causes can be remembered by the mnemonic HERNIA: * Hereditary factors: the disease runs in families * Endocrine imbalance: the disease tends to start at puberty and mostly involves females * Racial factors: white people are more susceptible than natives of equatorial Africa * Nutritional deficiency: vitamins A or D, or iron * Infection: Klebsiella ozaenae, diphtheroids, Proteus vulgaris, E. coli, etc. * Autoimmune factors: viral infection or some other unidentified insult may trigger antigenicity of the nasal mucosa. Secondary atrophic rhinitis Specific infections, such as syphilis, leprosy and rhinoscleroma, may cause destruction of the nasal structures leading to atrophic changes. Atrophic rhinitis can also result from long-standing purulent sinusitis or radiotherapy of the nose, or as a complication of surgery of the turbinates. The United Kingdom National Health Service has stated that \\"Most cases of atrophic rhinitis in the UK occur when the turbinates are damaged or removed during surgery\\". Some authors refer to as Atrophic rhinitis secondary to sinus surgery as the empty nose syndrome. Unilateral atrophic rhinitis Extreme deviation of nasal septum may be accompanied by atrophic rhinitis on the wider side. Pathology * The ciliated columnar epithelium of the nasal mucosa is replaced by stratified squamous epithelium. * Atrophy of mucosa, turbinal bones and seromucinous glands tends to occur, due to obliterative endarteritis and periarteritis causing decreased blood supply, hence the supplying area atrophies. * Arrested development of paranasal sinuses. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on clinical history and examination. Examination is clinical, via anterior rhinoscopy and fibreoptic, using nasendoscopy. A CT scan can be used to confirm the diagnosis and review disease extent. Treatment Treatment of atrophic rhinitis can be either medical or surgical. Medical measures include: *Nasal irrigation using normal saline *Nasal irrigation and removal of crusts using alkaline nasal solutions. *25% glucose in glycerine can be applied to the nasal mucosa to inhibit the growth of proteolytic organisms which produce foul smell. *Local antibiotics, such as chloromycetine. *Vitamin D2 . *Estradiol spray for regeneration of seromucinous glands and vascularization of mucosa. *Systemic streptomycin (1g/day) against Klebsiella organisms. *Oral potassium iodide for liquefaction of secretion. *Placental extract injected in the submucosa. *Rifampicin 600 mg once daily for 12 weeks. Surgical interventions include: *Young's operation. *Modified Young's operation. *Narrowing of nasal cavities, submucosal injection of Teflon paste(William's operation), section and medial displacement of the lateral wall of the nose. *Transposition of parotid duct to maxillary sinus or nasal mucosa(Wittmack's operation) *Complete inversion of mucoperiosteum of maxillary antrum to create a neoturbinate(Raghav Sharan's operation) *Repeated Stellate ganglion block(Sardana's operation) *Vestibuloplasty  History  This disorder was known since the time of ancient Egypt, almost 4,000 years ago, and descriptions of it are found in the historical medical papyri. In the Edwin Smith Papyrus (1700 BC) it was prescribed a treatment based on wine and breast milk to cure this disease. The ancient Greek and Indian civilizations were aware of atrophic rhinitis.

Happy Harry's operated 76 locations in Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey. It was founded in 1962 by entrepreneur Harry Levin. It was announced on June 5, 2006 that the chain had agreed to be acquired by Walgreens. History In 1962, Harry Levin opened his first store in Wilmington, Delaware simply called \\"Discount Center\\". He quickly gained a reputation for his always-cheerful disposition, and customers soon simply referred to his store as \\"Happy's\\". In 1965, upon opening his third store, the name of the chain was changed to \\"Happy Harry's Discount Drugs\\". Just before the company's 25th anniversary in 1987, \\"Happy Harry\\" died and his son, Alan Levin, took over the growing company. At the time, Happy Harry's was the largest drugstore chain in Delaware and soon grew to 76 stores. Acquisition and closure On June 5, 2006, Happy Harry's announced that it would be acquired by Walgreens. The announcement of the acquisition was surprising for Walgreens, whose approach differs most notably from its competitors when it comes to growth. Walgreens expansion is fueled primarily by opening new, freestanding, locations with drive-thru pharmacies, and occasionally by quiet acquisitions of small pharmacies, rather than expanding through mergers and public acquisitions.Walgreens press facts However, with little presence in Happy Harry's primary market, the addition of Happy Harry's was a valuable new resource for Walgreens to leverage in its continuing expansion. Initially, Walgreens decided to keep the Happy Harry's name on its existing stores. However, the eight stores in Pennsylvania were revamped as standard stores due to Walgreens' stronger branding there. Happy Harry's remained open in Delaware, but was modified to read \\"Happy Harry's, a Walgreens Pharmacy.\\" These stores went through significant interior and exterior modifications to conform to Walgreens standards for product display, store arrangement, and pharmacy design. Task forces from various Walgreens districts around the country were mobilized to convert the various store systems to the Walgreens equivalents. The most important conversion was for the pharmacy, whose computer system was changed to Walgreens homegrown Intercom Plus pharmacy computer software, along with the installation of satellite equipment, which linked each pharmacy with over 7,000 other Walgreens pharmacies in the continental United States, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. This enabled Happy Harry's customers to have prescriptions refilled and records retrieved at any Walgreens pharmacy nationwide. In April 2011, the last Happy Harry's pharmacies, in the Wilmington-area, were converted to Walgreens, with no remains of Happy Harry's.

History  Tufts is a finger-style guitarist living off-grid with his wife (pianist Kathryn Briggs) and daughter in the bush in Ontario. Tufts has been playing music for enjoyment since 1963 and as a profession since 1974. His father's job with the Canadian Government moved the family to Denver, Colorado in the U.S. in the 1960s at a time when the folk and rock music genres were influencing opinion everywhere. Other postings that influenced him musically took him to Ottawa, Ontario, and Rome, Italy. Upon returning to Canada to complete high school, he began to work as a full-time musician and continues to do so to this day. In 1974 he moved to Fredericton, New Brunswick, to begin pursuing his own musical career as a singer-songwriter and guitarist for A JOINT EFFORT (Rick Bastedo, Brian Bourne, Grant Harrison, Tim Tufts, and Terry Tufts), and later a reformed version of that band called REDROCK HOTEL (Dan Artuso, Brian Bourne, Mario Melanson, Tim Tufts, and Terry Tufts.) The Effort released on lp (FINAL EFFORT) upon the groups disbanding, and one 45 rpm recording with RedRock (HITCHIKER'S DREAM - T. Tufts b/w YOUR CONSTANT CHANGE - B. Bourne) was released in the late 70's. Tufts has worked as a session musician and sideman for a variety of artists including Tom Paxton, Kathryn Briggs, David Francey, Colleen Peterson, Laura Smith, Laura Bird, Ian Tamblyn, Bill Garrett & Sue Lothrop, Charlie Sohmer, The Arrogant Worms, Wayne Rostad, Susan Aglukark, Tracey Brown, and George Fox. In 2014 with Kathryn Briggs he formed the duo K.E.W.T. (initials for Kathryn Elizabeth & William Terence). They are joined by double bassist John Geggie. Two albums were released over the next two years. In 2016, under suggestion by luthier Linda Manzer, the trio formed The Algonquin Ensemble (with Lisa Moody - viola, Laura Nerenberg - violin, and Margaret Tobolowska - cello) to musically interpret the canvases and life story of Canadian Group of Seven motivator Tom Thomson. Their piece, SONIC PALETTE: Tom Thomson's Voice Through Music 100 Years Later, premiered at the McMichael Canadian Art Collection July 9, 2017 to a sold out audience. Tufts has recorded six albums, one of which remains unreleased. Three of these albums are on Borealis Records. Arctic Rose is the opening cut from Susan Aglukark’s 1982 debut album, first titled DREAMS FOR YOU and re-released as ARCTIC ROSE. The music is written by Terry Tufts as well as the original lyric after being approached by the album’s producer, Randall Prescott, who was looking for material for the project. The lyric deals with a friend or Aglukark’s who was sent South from her home to school. His experience was not a good one and he took his own life. Randall Prescott briefly told of the incident to Tufts and Tufts changed a song he had already written to accommodate the story. Later Prescott said Aglukark, referring to her late friend, had told him “he was so beautiful” and Prescott asked Tufts to put the line in the song, Aglukark never being able to be present for the writing. Aglukark added two lines in Inuktitut at the beginning of the song sung to the guitar riff Tufts constructed. The original lyric Tufts wrote to his music is below: ARCTIC ROSE He came from the Keewatin where half the year was night But he never knew what darkness was ‘til he’d seen those city lights He never really felt the cold ‘til he walked in white man’s shoes A stranger in the strangest land, abandoned and abused They sent him south away from home and buried him in school A flower pulled out by the roots, a hunter without tools. CHORUS It’s not the sharpness of the blade, It’s how much light it throws It’s more the way the wisdom’s used Than just how much one knows Why would you pick the perfect flower When you could have watched it grow? A worthless act, a waste of life When you pluck the Arctic Rose And then the warm came creeping and the restlessness took hold Calling back to older ways, the path deep in his soul And when his hopes had taken flight and his dreams all but let go He silently let go of life and the spirits brought him home Dying bloom in fading light, as dark as dark can be Never to become the flower that he was meant to be REPEAT CHORUS '' W.T.

The words on the cross, Ut Vitam Habeant mean: \\"That They May Have Life\\" (Jn. 10:10) The Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary (known in the United States as the RSHM and in other parts of the world as RSCM) are a global Roman Catholic community of about 900 apostolic religious women. Today the diversity of ministries include educational, pastoral and social services. RSHM work in colleges and universities, secondary and elementary schools. RSHM serve in parishes and prisons, in hospitals and nursing homes, in studios and social centers, in retreat houses and retirement homes. Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary are administrators, teachers, social workers, artists, lawyers, health care personnel, musicians, librarians, spiritual directors, and others. The community is not to be confused with the Religious of the Sacred Heart, another name for the Society of the Sacred Heart, who use the abbreviation RSCJ. History The Institute of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary (RSHM) was founded on February 24, 1849 in Béziers, France by Father Jean Gailhac and Appollonie Pelissier-Cure, (Mother St. Jean). A group of women gathered together to form a community which took over the direction of a shelter for women and an orphanage. The Institute grew rapidly and by the time the original group made their first profession in May 1851 their number had grown to ten. During her time as superior, a boarding school for girls was begun. In a short time, the sisters expanded their ministry beyond France, and presently, the community serves in 14 countries.For further information, see an expanded view of RSHM history. The rule of life of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary, the RSHM Constitutions, was approved on the diocesan level in 1850, the canonical level in 1880 and revised in 1983. Government The major authority of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary is the General Superior, who, with the General Council have residence in Rome, Italy.

He patronised Kannada poet and commander SriVijaya and Sanskrit poet Trivikrama. Indra III was married to princess Vijamba of the Kalachuri dynasty of central India (Chedi). Capture of Kannauj Immediately after coming to power, Indra III had to fight a Paramara ruler, a feudatory of Gurjara Prathihara and routed him out of Govardhana near Nasik. Thereafter the Paramaras became feudatories of the Rashtrakutas.Kamath (2001), p80 The Gurjara Pratihara ruler Mahendrapala I was experiencing some family feuds and this gave Indra III an opportunity to attack Kannauj in the Ganges - Yamuna doab.From the Cambay plates (Kamath 2001, p80) Kannauj at this time was under the control of the Pratihara empire.

History and profile De Groene Amsterdammer was founded in 1877, making it one of the oldest Dutch news magazines still in existence. The magazine started under the name De Amsterdammer, meaning The Amsterdammer. In its early days green ink was used, later causing the word groene (green) to be added to its name when a second newspaper in Amsterdam was published under the same name De Amsterdammer. The name De Groene Amsterdammer became official in 1925. As its title implies the weekly is based in Amsterdam. During the German occupation between 1940 and 1945 the magazine temporarily ceased publication. Over the course of time the magazine manifested itself in Dutch media with a wide range of subjects being published about, varying from philosophy, politics and literature to the liberal arts. De Groene Amsterdammer, unlike its name suggests, shows a keen interest in international subjects, with a network of freelance correspondents in various countries over the world.

Originally formed after the First World War, the club was re-established in 1948, and since 2006 has played in the National Conference League. History Early years Established just after the First World War, Dudley Hill originally played on the old Bierley estate. They were led by rugby league player Stanley Brogden who, after his career as a stand-off with Leeds, Yorkshire and Great Britain, wanted to put something back into the grassroots of rugby league. The club was disbanded prior to the Second World War, and was reformed in 1948, due to Les Brady, who was running the successful Bierley under 18 team at the time, Vincent Heslop and Danny Cullerton. Heslop advertised in the Telegraph & Argus for players and, together with players progressing from the Bierley under 18 team, the Dudley Hill open age team was formed. Funds were raised by various means, including a football buster and Bradford Northern forecast. The first match played was at Queensbury, which Dudley Hill lost by over 50 points to nil, missing a free kick under the posts in the last few minutes. The first win of the season was at Prince Smith and Steels, four points to eight. One of the Dudley Hill Players broke his arm and Heslop, who had the only available transport, a former army wagon, had to stop playing to take him to hospital. As there was no insurance available, a collection was taken every week for injured players. At the end of the season, Dudley Hill finished just above Prince Smith and Steels, who were bottom of the league. Various changing rooms were used during this period, but eventually the Imperial Hotel on Tong Street was used, where buckets of water were begged from the publican for washing. Eventually, a boiler and bath were installed, and washing facilities improved. Even so, players would often use the cottage baths at the entrance to Knowles Lane Recreation Ground. For away matches, the players usually met outside sports shops in the centre of Bradford, and proceeded to the matches by public transport. Home matches were played on various grounds: Knowles Recreation Ground, Knowles Lane and Odsal Rec. During the next few seasons with new players coming into the team from Bierley and other sources, better results were achieved and the foundations were laid to make Dudley Hill a force in amateur rugby league circles. The coach at this time was Frank Hodgson, who recruited key players that were to complement the sprinkling of talented young players at the club, among them 18-year-old Ian Dickinson, Ian Reed, Neil Margerison and Rudolph Francis. Post war years Mick Oldfield became the first Dudley Hill player to play for Yorkshire in the post-war period, Heslop was the first to progress to Bradford Northern and Richard Rudd the first international player. During the next few decades, a host of players followed Heslop and Oldfield, some ending up in the professional ranks and some playing amateur representative football for Bradford, Yorkshire, and Great Britain. The formation of the British Amateur Rugby League Association (BARLA) in 1973 was to be the catalyst for Dudley Hill to move forward. In that season the club finished bottom of the old Bradford League. As a result, when the regional leagues were established, Dudley Hill were placed in the new Pennine League 3rd Division. In successive years, the club progressed to the first division, eventually reaching the Premier Division. Even with improved results and a stronger team, it was not until 1979 that Dudley Hill won their first trophy as winners of the Bradford League seven-a-side competition. The club's ambition was realised in 1986 when they became one of the ten inaugural teams in the National League. The club moved to Neil Hunt Memorial Ground, named after a 16-year-old player who died during a match, in 1979 In December 1976 16-year-old Neil Hunt died after sustaining a broken neck in a one-on-one tackle during a match. On 1 September 1979 the club moved to the new Neil Hunt Memorial Ground; in December 2001, it was re-dedicated in a ceremony to mark the 25th anniversary of Hunt's death. Between 1979 and 1992, Dudley Hill won every trophy available to them at local, regional and national Level, between 1984 until 1986 winning the BARLA National Cup, BARLA Yorkshire Cup, BARLA National Sevens, Pennine League Premier Division, Pennine Cup, Bradford Cup and numerous Sevens titles. In 1990 Dudley Hill won the National League title, and in 1991 were beaten in the BARLA National Cup final in Salford. The club were one of the 12 teams in the new National Conference League when it was created in 1993. Success at youth and junior levels was the catalyst for setting up a youth and junior development programme, and 1987 saw the formation of a women's team, Dudley Hill Thunderbirds, who were inaugural members of the first Women's League, although they were subsequently disbanded due to funding difficulties. A grant of £75,000 meant that, in 1993, the clubhouse was extended and refurbished, new dressing rooms built, and floodlights installed. Dudley Hill were founder members of National League Three in 2003, and won the title in 2005. However, the senior team returned to the National Conference League following the end of the 2006 season, as there were too few fixtures to ensure financial viability. 2006–2016 After joining the National Conference League at the end of the 2005–06 season Dudley Hill were put into the NCL Division 2. Their 2006 Challenge Cup campaign saw them beat Gateshead Storm (42–12) and Warrington Wizards (22–20) before losing to semi-professional side Dewsbury Rams (0–68). During the 2006–07 season Dudley Hill won many games eventually being promoted with Saddleworth Rangers at the end of the year. They managed to stay in Division 1 for the 2007–08 and the 2008–09 season. In their 2007 Challenge Cup run they beat Brighouse Rangers (42–4) before bowing out against Castleford Lock Lane (26–28). During the 2008 Challenge Cup, Dudley Hill beat Dewsbury Celtic (72–0) but lost to York Acorn (6–14) in Round 2. In the 2009–10 season they won promotion (again alongside Saddleworth Rangers) to the Premier Division. The 2009 Challenge Cup included a win against Halifax Irish (22–10) before being knocked out against Widnes St Maries (19–24). Dudley Hill's 2010 Challenge Cup run didn't last long as they were knocked out in Round 1 by Castleford Panthers (18–20). Bradford Dudley Hill only lasted one season in the Premier Division as they were relegated at the end of the 2010–11 season along with Wigan St Judes and York Acorn. The NCL decided to switch from player winter seasons to summer season and thus held an interim season in 2011. Meanwhile, in the 2011 Challenge Cup, Dudley Hill beat Kells (22–14) before losing narrowly to Fryston (12–16). The 2012 Challenge Cup started well for Dudley Hill, they beat Castleford Panthers (38–0), Askam (52–12) and Leigh East (16–6). In Round 3 they were handed a profitable tie against Keighley Cougars who proved too strong for Dudley Hill (6–58). The 2012 NCL season saw Dudley Hill compete in Division 1, they were in the promotion places for much of the season but a few slip ups saw them finish 4th, just 1 point behind the top 3. They did however finish with the highest points difference. Dudley Hill's 2013 Challenge Cup campaign started with a bye as the Bonymaen Broncos had to pull out due to player shortages. They beat Eastmoor Dragons (68–12) before losing in Round 1 to Leeds Metropolitan University (24–28). The 2013 season was a mixed season for Dudley Hill as the finished mid-table (7th) however they were unable to compete in a fixture against Rochdale Mayfield on the scheduled date due to player shortages and the club was fined and relegated. In addition to this the club suffered from financial problems which nearly put the club out of existence, however hard work was put into the club by various people and ensured that Dudley Hill survived. Due to the problems the club decided not to enter the 2014 Challenge Cup citing that they couldn't guarantee being in business when the competition commenced. 2014 saw the club compete in Division Two of the National Conference league. They had a mixed start to the season with some inconsistent form but they eventually put a run of 10 games unbeaten to nearly grab automatic promotion to be denied by a two-point deduction for fielding an ineligible player. Throughout the season Dudley Hill did the double over heavy favourites Pilkington Recs and also stealing a win against Elland. Eventually Dudley Hill finished 4th in the league and beat Ovenden (36–8) in the play-offs before losing in the play-off final to Pilkington Recs (10–28). In the Conference Challenge Trophy the team beat Division One opponents Saddleworth Rangers (20–18) before losing to Premier side Leigh Miner Rangers (18–42). During the off-season hooker Nathan Kitson signed for semi-professional side Oxford Rugby League of the Kingstone Press League 1. Former player and ex Gloucestershire All Golds scrum half Danny Thomas took over the role of head coach. Dudley Hill once again did not enter the Challenge Cup. Hill started the 2015 season with 5 consecutive losses followed by a heavy loss to West Hull (0–62) in the Conference Challenge Cup. Soon after this defeat coach Danny Thomas was sacked by the club and former coach and ex player Jason Lee took the reins. In his first game in charge Hill beat Dewsbury Celtic (42–24) who had just recently appointed Hill's ex coach Danny Thomas. After two big wins, Hill suffered three big losses before hammering Oldham St Annes (76–8) in the biggest winning margin of the season. An inconsistent end to the season saw Dudley Hill finish 7th in the league. Hill started the season with four victories in a row including a season opening win against Stanley Rangers (38–10). However a defeat to Askham and a heavy loss in the Conference Challenge Cup to Rochdale Mayfield (6–54) dented their good start. Throughout the season Dudley Hill's form varied from match to match culminating in only winning 13 of their 22 matches in the league. Hill finished 7th and missed out on the playoffs by points difference. 2017–present Club achievements Dudley Hill have beaten several established professional rugby league teams, including York City Knights, and Keighley Cougars. In 2012, in addition to the senior team, the club ran teams at six junior age levels, had a women's team, Dudley Hill Diamonds, and a team in the Pennine League Division 4.

The 2006 Pittsburgh Steelers season was the franchise's 74th season as a professional sports franchise and as a member of the National Football League. It was the 7th season under leadership of general manager Kevin Colbert and the 15th and last under head coach Bill Cowher and he retired on January 5, 2007. The team failed to improve on their 11–5 record from 2005 and also failed to defend their Super Bowl XL championship, Instead, they finished the season with an 8-8 record in and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2003. Personnel Staff Notable additions include Santonio Holmes, Ryan Clark and Willie Colon Roster Offseason Bill Cowher and the Steelers before the Baltimore Ravens game on November 26 On March 3, 2006, backup quarterback Tommy Maddox and cornerback Willie Williams (a member of the Super Bowl XL Steelers team) were released for salary cap reasons. Later on, the team lost wide receiver Antwaan Randle El, defensive end Kimo von Oelhoffen, and free safety Chris Hope to free agency, but picked up safety Ryan Clark from the Washington Redskins. The team used the 2006 NFL draft to fill in the remaining holes on the depth chart. In the first round, Pittsburgh traded up to select Ohio St. wide receiver Santonio Holmes. Then, they used their next pick (acquired from the Vikings) on Syracuse Safety Anthony Smith. The rest of their picks included Florida St. wide receiver Willie Reid, Hofstra guard Willie Colon, Miami University (Fl.) defensive end Orien Harris, Bowling Green quarterback Omar Jacobs, Purdue tight end Charles Davis, California center Marvin Philip, and Virginia Tech running back Cedric Humes. On June 2 members of the Super Bowl Champion Steelers were invited to the White House to meet the President Of The United States George Bush in a celebration to honor the Steelers' successful season. Ben Roethlisberger motorcycle accident Chiefs, October 15, 2006 In the offseason Ben Roethlisberger suffered a near death accident while riding his motorcycle in downtown Pittsburgh. He was not at fault, and an out of state vehicle failed to yield and hit him. Ben reportedly was moments away from dying due to a cut artery, however medics stopped the bleeding in time. This set Ben back for training camp and the Preseason. However, he did manage to play in part of the Preseason games. Shortly after the Preseason however, Ben required an emergency appendectomy which caused him to miss the first game of the season. Between both of these events, Ben reportedly lost 15 pounds and was not up to form with the team due to lack of practice time and time spent in camp. His health early in the year is pointed to as the cause for a rough season. He experienced continued problems in the Atlanta Falcons game in Atlanta during the year. He was hit after throwing the ball by multiple defenders, one of which caused a helmet to helmet collision. Roethlisberger was diagnosed with a concussion and had to sit out the rest of the game and appeared to have difficulties in the next couple of games. 2006 NFL Draft Preseason Schedule {  ! Week !

First, Roethlisberger was injured on a pass to Miller, which caused him to leave the game with a concussion. Second, Atlanta retook the lead with running back Warrick Dunn completing a one-yard touchdown run, which was started from a fumble by Willie Parker. The Steelers responded as quarterback Charlie Batch completed a 70-yard touchdown pass to Ward. However, the Falcons retook the lead with Vick and Crumpler hooking up with each other for a third touchdown pass, this time for 31 yards. In the fourth quarter, Atlanta kicker Morten Andersen nailed a 25-yard field goal to give the Falcons a 7-point lead. Pittsburgh responded with a 17-yard touchdown pass to Ward, his third touchdown. Near the end of regulation, things got complicated for Atlanta on a field goal attempt. Kicker Michael Koenen nailed a 56-yard field goal, but it got negated due to a late Steelers time-out. Koenan rekicked it. It was no good, yet safety Troy Polamalu was called for running into the kicker. The Falcons brought in kicker Andersen to make a 52-yard field goal, yet it came up short. On the following drive, the Steelers could not score after a controversial false start call with the Steelers in field goal range prompted a 10-second runoff, which ended regulation. In overtime the Falcons won the coin toss. Falcons kicker Morten Andersen, after an 11 play 65 yard drive, won the game with a 32-yard field goal and gave the Steelers their fourth loss of the season while they fell to 2–4. Stats Week 8 (Sunday October 29, 2006): at Oakland Raiders Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Falcons, the Steelers flew to McAfee Coliseum to take on the Oakland Raiders.

Oakland responded with kicker Sebastian Janikowski kicking a 19-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Janikowski increased the Raiders lead with a 41-yard field goal for the only score of the quarter. In the fourth quarter Raiders defensive-back Chris Carr returned an interception 100 yards for a touchdown. Pittsburgh tried to rally with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completing a 25-yard touchdown pass to running back Willie Parker. The Raiders were able to hold off the Steelers in the closing seconds of the game, earning a victory as the Steelers fell to 2–5. Stats Despite the Steelers out-gaining the Raiders 360–98 in total offense, Roethlisberger threw four interceptions (two of which were returned for touchdowns), which led to Oakland's first back-to-back victory of the year. Week 9 (Sunday November 5, 2006): vs. Denver Broncos Hoping to rebound from their two-game losing streak, the Steelers came back home to host the 5–2 Denver Broncos. Despite Ben Roethlisberger throwing for 433 yards and one touchdown, the Steelers had six turnovers with three interceptions and three fumbles in a 31–20 loss to the Broncos. The Steelers were trailing by four points at halftime, but in the third quarter, wide receiver Javon Walker scored on a 72-yard reverse to put the Broncos up 21–10. It looked like the Steelers had a comeback when receiver Hines Ward caught a pass and jumped towards the end zone, but the ball popped out and the Broncos recovered and were able to run out the clock. With a third-straight loss, the Steelers fell to 2–6. There was a suspected terror event that day. Stats Week 10 (Sunday November 12, 2006): vs. New Orleans Saints The Pittsburgh Steelers hosted the New Orleans Saints on Sunday in a shoot out. Pittsburgh jumped to a 14–0 lead in the first quarter after Hines Ward caught a touchdown pass and when the Steelers capitalized on a Saints turnover with another touchdown pass to Heath Miller. The Saints came marching back and took the lead with Reggie Bush's rush TD on the double reverse and pulled further ahead with a Deuce McAllister 4-yd TD run near the end of the half. A Reggie Bush fumble, a missed field goal, and Willie Parker's two 70+ yard runs set up two scores, which allowed the Steelers to come back and take the lead to win. The Steelers went to 3–6 with the win while the Saints fell to 6–3. Stats Week 11 (Sunday November 19, 2006): at Cleveland Browns Hoping to build off their victory over the Saints, the Steelers flew to Cleveland Browns Stadium for Round 1 of the Rust Belt series with the Cleveland Browns.

Thomas returned it 57 yards for a touchdown and the only score of the quarter. In the fourth quarter, Stover put the game away with a 40-yard field goal. Stats Not only did Baltimore's offense help contribute to the Steelers dropping to 4–7, the Ravens defense (anchored by the return of veteran LB Ray Lewis) was also a huge factor, as they sacked Roethlisberger nine times and forced two interceptions.

Stats Standings References Pittsburgh Category:Pittsburgh Steelers seasons Pitts ","title":"2006 Pittsburgh Steelers season"},{"id":"6891186","text":"The 2006 Miami Dolphins season was the franchise's 37th season in the National Football League, the 41st overall and the second and final under head coach Nick Saban. The team failed to improve on their 9–7 record in 2005, and they finished the season 6–10 after being hyped by some to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl, and saw their coach Nick Saban abandon his contract to coach college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide, despite saying repeatedly that he would stay in Miami. This season was also best known for the Dolphins almost signing former San Diego Chargers quarterback Drew Brees, as they were one of the two teams (the other being the New Orleans Saints) interested in acquiring the released quarterback. However the Dolphins later declined the idea after doctors informed them that Brees’ shoulder injury was too severe, and they ended up signing Daunte Culpepper instead. Brees ended up signing with the Saints instead, led them to their first Super Bowl title in 2010, and is believed by many to be the greatest Saint of all time. Many believe that if Brees signed with the Dolphins, they would've made it to a Super Bowl, would compete with the Patriots for the AFC East title, and that Saban and Brees would've been the Dolphins' best team since the Shula/Marino eras, with some also believing the Alabama dynasty might've never happened, or that the Saints would relocate from New Orleans. Offseason On March 14, 2006, the Dolphins traded a second-round draft pick to the Minnesota Vikings to acquire quarterback Daunte Culpepper. Miami also acquired tackle L. J. Shelton from Cleveland and cornerback Will Allen from the New York Giants, replacing longtime Dolphin Sam Madison, who had taken Allen's old spot with the Giants. The Dolphins had also nearly signed now-Saints quarterback Drew Brees, following his release by the San Diego Chargers and prior to the signing of Culpepper. In the 2006 NFL Draft, the Dolphins used their first pick on Tennessee safety Jason Allen. They then used their next pick on Arizona State wide receiver Derek Hagan. The rest of their picks included Washington offensive tackle Joe Toledo, Texas State/San Marcos defensive tackles Fred Evans and Rodrique Wright, and Auburn wide receiver Devin Aromashodu. On May 12, 2006, the Dolphins completed a trade with the Detroit Lions for quarterback Joey Harrington, and the Lions received a fifth-round pick after Harrington met performance stipulations in Miami. They also signed Marcus Vick (ex-Virginia Tech quarterback and younger brother of Atlanta Falcons star Michael Vick) to a contract after he attended their annual rookie mini-camp. On August 12, Miami lost, 23–19, to the Jacksonville Jaguars in their first preseason game of the year. The Dolphins' pulled out starting QB Daunte Culpepper after throwing only two passes. (1–2, 2 yds) All of the opposing Jaguars' touchdowns came on plays longer than 25 yards. On August 14, the Dolphins signed free agent defensive tackle Dan \\"Big Daddy\\" Wilkinson, a former 1st overall draft pick of the Cincinnati Bengals (1994), and who had last played for the Detroit Lions. On August 14, perennial All-Pro linebacker Junior Seau (who had been with the Dolphins for three seasons until he was released in March 2006) announced his retirement after 16 years in the NFL. However, he eventually joined the Dolphins' division rival, the New England Patriots. Staff Roster Schedule {  - ! Week ! Date ! Opponent ! Result ! TV !

Even though newly acquired QB Daunte Culpepper was doing a pretty good job on the pass and RB Ronnie Brown provided a touchdown, the Dolphins trailed 14–10 going into the second half, until Brown got another rushing touchdown. An 87-yard touchdown pass to Steeler tight end Heath Miller and a 42-yard interception return by ROLB Joey Porter sealed the Dolphins' fate. Head coach Nick Saban attempted to challenge Miller's touchdown reception on the grounds that he stepped out of bounds before reaching the goal line (which television replays proved was correct), however, officials failed to see Saban throw the red flag before the Steelers kicked the extra point, and the Dolphins were unable to challenge the call. Of more concern than simply the loss was the performance of the Dolphins' prized offseason acquisition. Daunte Culpepper threw two interceptions, and floated several passes that were almost intercepted. This performance has sparked debate as to whether he will be able to return to his 2004 form or if he will have a repeat of his terrible 2005 campaign. One positive from the game was slot WR Wes Welker. He had 67 yards receiving and set up the first TD for Miami. With the loss, the Dolphins fell to 0–1. Week 2: vs. Buffalo Bills at Dolphin Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida The Dolphins were hoping to rebound by playing an AFC East bout with the visiting Buffalo Bills in their Week 2 home-opener. From the start, the Dolphins were unable to get anything going, as the Bills' Rian Lindell kicked a 33-yard field goal in the first quarter, while Buffalo's defense prevented Miami from getting any points throughout the first half. In the third quarter, things only got worse, as opposing QB J. P. Losman threw a 4-yard TD pass to opposing WR Josh Reed, while Lindell booted two field goals (45 & 43-yarders). The Dolphins finally managed to get some points as WR Chris Chambers caught a 23-yard TD pass, but Miami failed on the two-point conversion. What made this loss even more frustrating was that Dolphins QB Daunte Culpepper got sacked seven times and fumbled twice, making Miami wonder if acquiring Culpepper was the right idea in the first place. With the loss, the Dolphins were 0–2. Week 3: vs. Tennessee Titans at Dolphin Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida The Dolphins, still looking for their first win of the year, stayed at home for a Week 3 match-up with the Tennessee Titans. Miami drew first blood in the first quarter with kicker Olindo Mare kicking a 40-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Dolphins got a bit of a scare as Titans QB Kerry Collins completed a 27-yard pass to TE Bo Scaife for a touchdown and the lead. In the third quarter, Miami reclaimed the lead with QB Daunte Culpepper getting a touchdown on a 5-yard scramble. However, the Titans didn't go down quietly, as kicker Rob Bironas kicked a 22-yard field goal for Tennessee, putting the game in a 10–10 tie. In the fourth quarter, Mare finally helped Miami get win their first win of the season with a 39-yard field goal. Week 4: at Houston Texans at Reliant Stadium, Houston, Texas The Dolphins hoped to carry the momentum from their Week 3 victory, as they traveled to Reliant Stadium to take on the Houston Texans. After a scoreless first quarter, Miami got on the board first with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 52-yard field goal, but the Texans got a field goal for themselves, as kicker Kris Brown got one from 32 yards out. In the third quarter, the Dolphins got another field goal, as Mare got one from 29 yards out for the only score of the period. However, in the fourth quarter, things got very ugly as the Texans got two touchdowns, with QB David Carr on a 1-yard run and WR Andre Johnson getting a 3-yard touchdown reception. Miami valiantly tried to fight back, as Mare got a 22-yard field goal and QB Daunte Culpepper completed a 16-yard TD pass to WR Chris Chambers, but in the end, a failed two-point conversion spelled doom for the Dolphins, as Miami failed to come back and fell to 1–3. Week 5: at New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Massachusetts With Daunte Culpepper being ineffective, QB Joey Harrington got the start for Week 5 as the Dolphins flew to Gillette Stadium for an AFC East match-up with the New England Patriots. Miami got off to a rough start, as they fell behind 3–0 with Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski kicking a 35-yard field goal for the only score of the first quarter. In the second quarter, Miami continued to trail, as Gostkowski kicked a 31-yard field goal, while Pats QB Tom Brady completed a 10-yard TD pass to WR Troy Brown. The Dolphins got back in the game before halftime, as RB Ronnie Brown got a 2-yard TD run and kicker Olindo Mare got a 40-yard field goal to help the Dolphins trail by three at halftime. In the third quarter, the defense ruled as both teams failed to get a single point. In the fourth quarter, New England scored another touchdown, as Brady completed a 1-yard strike to FB Heath Evans. From there, Miami failed to catch up, and their record fell to 1–4. Week 6: at New York Jets at Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, New Jersey Still searching for win #2, the Dolphins kept QB Joey Harrington in the starting line-up as they flew to The Meadowlands for an AFC East fight with the New York Jets. From the get-go, the Dolphins struggled as Jets kicker Mike Nugent kicked a 33-yard field goal for the only score of the first quarter and of the half. In the third quarter, Nugent increased New York's lead again with another 33-yard field goal. The Dolphins finally got on the board, as kicker Olindo Mare got a 21-yard field goal. However, the Jets didn't let Miami regain itself, as QB Chad Pennington completed a 58-yard TD pass to WR Laveranues Coles. In the fourth quarter, they hooked up with each other again on a 22-yard TD pass. The Dolphins attempted a fourth-quarter comeback, with Harrington completing a 2-yard TD pass to WR Chris Chambers and RB Ronnie Brown ran 1 yard for a TD, but when Mare missed a field goal attempt in the final minute, and the Dolphins sank to 1–5. Week 7: vs. Green Bay Packers at Dolphin Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida QB Joey Harrington had 414 yards off a record 62 attempts (33 of them were complete), but he also threw 3 INT's (one returned for a TD). Packers RB Ahman Green rushed for about 100 yards, including a 70 yd TD. Packers QB Brett Favre had 206 yards throwing and two 2 TD's and is closing on Dan Marino's all-time completions and touchdown records. Meanwhile, Favre's favorite WR Donald Driver had 10 receptions for 93 yards and a touchdown. With the Dolphins, RB Ronnie Brown was limited to just 59 yards rushing on 15 carries and 63 yards receiving on 5 receptions. The leading receiver for Miami was WR Marty Booker, who had 7 receptions for 110 yards and a touchdown. With the loss, the Dolphins fell to 1–6. Week 9: at Chicago Bears at Soldier Field, Chicago, Illinois Coming off their bye week, the Dolphins got their second win of the season against the previously undefeated Chicago Bears at Soldier Field. Just as the 1985 Dolphins ended the Bears' attempt at a perfect season (they finished 18–1), this year's Dolphins again protected the 1972 Perfect Season on their own. QB Joey Harrington was 16/32, for 137 yards, and 3 touchdowns, despite 2 interceptions. The Dolphins fumbled twice, but recovered both times, and the Bears also fumbled twice, but both times Miami came away with the ball. The Dolphins were also able to capitalize on 3 interceptions on Rex Grossman passes. Ronnie Brown rushed for a career-high 157 yards, carrying 29 times. Jason Taylor forced a fumble and returned an interception 20 yards for a touchdown, helping Miami in its 31–13 victory. The spirit of the 1972 Dolphins looked alive and well as Miami improved to 2–6 on the year. Week 10: vs. Kansas City Chiefs at Dolphin Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida Coming off their amazing upset road win against the Bears, the Dolphins returned home for a Week 10 match-up with the Kansas City Chiefs. The Dolphins dominated the first half with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 40-yard field goal in the first quarter and a 22-yarder in the second quarter. Also in the second period, RB Ronnie Brown got a 1-yard TD run. After a scoreless third quarter, the Chiefs offense finally got going in the final period. Kicker Lawrence Tynes nailed a 27-yard field goal, while RB Larry Johnson got a 2-yard TD. Miami held on to its small lead and advanced to 3–6 on the year. Week 11: vs. Minnesota Vikings at Dolphin Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida Coming off a two-game winning streak, the Dolphins stayed at home for a Week 11 fight against teammate Daunte Culpepper's former team, the Minnesota Vikings. In the first quarter, the Vikings struck first as RB Chester Taylor got a 1-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Dolphins took to the water as kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 44-yard field goal, while QB Joey Harrington got an 11-yard TD pass to TE Justin Peelle. In the third quarter, Minnesota came closer with kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 35-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Vikings took a three-point lead, as Longwell kicked a 19-yard field goal. However, the Miami defense stepped up and made decisive plays. Free safety Renaldo Hill returned a fumble 48 yards for a touchdown, and DE Jason Taylor returned an interception 51 yards for a touchdown. Minnesota got one more touchdown (another 1-yard TD run by Taylor), but Miami ran out the clock to preserve their third victory in a row. With the win, the Dolphins improved to 4–6. The Dolphins' rushing yardage was a franchise low (−3 yards), and a team record for the Vikings' defense. Week 12: at Detroit Lions at Ford Field, Detroit, Michigan Going for their fourth-straight win, the Dolphins traveled to Ford Field for a Thanksgiving fight with the Detroit Lions. This game was Dolphins' QB Joey Harrington's return to Detroit, and he was constantly booed throughout the contest. In the first quarter, Miami trailed as Lions QB Jon Kitna got Detroit off to a fast start. Kitna completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Dan Campbell, while kicker Jason Hanson nailed a 52-yard field goal. Afterwards, Harrington started to get the Dolphins back into business as he completed his first-ever Thanksgiving touchdown pass on an 8-yard strike to WR Marty Booker. In the second quarter, Harrington acquired the only score of the period on a 5-yard TD pass to TE Randy McMichael. In the third quarter, kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 42-yard field goal, while Harrington and Booker connected with each other again on a 19-yard TD pass. In the fourth quarter, Mare managed to put the game away with a 28-yard field goal. RB Ronnie Brown only had 68 yards rushing (with 5 yards receiving), as he left the game early with a broken left hand. He is currently week-to-week and will likely miss the team's next game against Jacksonville. With the Dolphins victory, not only did the Dolphins improve to 5–6, but Harrington also got his second-ever Thanksgiving Day victory and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd touchdown pass ever on Thanksgiving Day. Week 13: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars at Dolphin Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida After a fine performance on Thanksgiving Day against the Lions, the Dolphins returned home for a Week 13 got off to a good start when QB Joey Harrington completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Marty Booker. The Jaguars responded with kicker Josh Scobee's 48-yard field goal. In the second quarter, things started looking grim for Miami as QB David Garrard completed two TD passes to WR Matt Jones (for 15 yards) and TE George Wrighster (for 16 yards). After a scoreless third quarter, Jacksonville continued its dominance with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 32-yard TD run. The Dolphins' only response was kicker Olindo Mare getting a 42-yard field goal. With the loss, the Dolphins fell to 5–7. Week 14: vs. New England Patriots at Dolphin Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida Hoping to rebound from their loss to Jaguars, the Dolphins stayed at home for an AFC East rematch with the New England Patriots. From start to finish, Miami stayed in the driver's seat and lead throughout the game. In the first quarter, the Dolphins' dominating day began with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 35-yard field goal in the first quarter, while also getting a 33-yard field goal in the second quarter. In the third quarter, Miami continued their hot day as QB Joey Harrington completed a 32-yard TD pass to WR Marty Booker for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, RB Sammy Morris got a 3-yard TD run, which was followed up by a completed 2-point conversion pass from Harrington to Booker.

Week 15: at Buffalo Bills at Ralph Wilson Stadium, Orchard Park, New York Coming off their dominating win over the Patriots, the Dolphins flew to Ralph Wilson Stadium for an AFC East rematch with the Buffalo Bills. After a scoreless first quarter, Miami trailed early as in the second quarter, Bills QB J. P. Losman completed a 33-yard TD pass to TE Robert Royal for the only score of the period. In the third quarter, things got worse as Losman completed a 27-yard TD pass to WR Josh Reed for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Dolphins' playoff hopes were completely erased when Losman completed a 21-yard TD pass to WR Lee Evans. With the loss, not only did Miami fall to 6–8, but they were unable to make the playoffs (and thus unable to play Super Bowl XLI on their home turf as they were the host city for that game) as the Jets (8–6) and Jacksonville (8–6) would win by tiebreakers even if they lost their remaining two games. Week 16: vs. New York Jets at Dolphin Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida Coming off an embarrassing loss to the Bills, the Dolphins played their final home game of the year on a rainy Monday Night in an AFC East fight with the New York Jets. After a scoreless first half with QB Joey Harrington playing a mediocre 7/15 for 42 yards, back-up Cleo Lemon came in to begin the second half. In the third quarter, New York broke first with kicker Mike Nugent getting a 22-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Miami finally went on the attack with Lemon completing a 7-yard TD pass to TE Randy McMichael. However, the Jets responded with QB Chad Pennington completing a 32-yard TD pass to WR Jerricho Cotchery. Even though the Dolphins managed to tie the game with kicker Olindo Mare's 25-yard field goal. New York made sure that head coach Nick Saban got his first losing season with the Dolphins after Nugent nailed the game-winning 30-yard field goal with ten seconds left. With the loss, Miami fell to 6–9. Week 17: at Indianapolis Colts at the RCA Dome, Indianapolis, Indiana Trying to end their season on a high note, the Dolphins flew to the RCA Dome to take on the playoff-bound Indianapolis Colts. In the first quarter, Miami struck first with kicker Olindo Mare getting a 28-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Colts respond with QB Peyton Manning completing a 2-yard TD pass to DT Dan Klecko. The Dolphins answered with Mare kicking a 38-yard field goal. However, Indianapolis struck back with Manning getting an 11-yard TD run, while kicker Adam Vinatieri getting a 46-yard field goal to end the half. In the third quarter, Miami tried to fight back with Mare's 42-yard field goal, yet the Colts matched them with Vinatieri's 34-yard field goal. The Dolphins got another field goal from Mare as he kicked one from 27 yards out. In the fourth quarter, Mare and Miami drew closer with a 34-yard field goal, yet Indianapolis ran away with the win as Manning completing a 27-yard TD pass to WR Marvin Harrison. The Dolphins got a touchdown as QB Cleo Lemon completed a 6-yard TD pass to TE Randy McMichael. However, the Colts' performance showed why they continue to be an elite NFL team. With the loss, Miami ended its season at 6–10 and out of the playoffs.  Random facts  *In 2006, the Dolphins shut out the New England Patriots 21–0 the previous week and were shut out by the Buffalo Bills by the same deficit the next week. *Starting quarterback Joey Harrington won the CBS All- Iron Award for his performance on Thanksgiving and got to sample Phil Simms' mother's blackberry cobbler. *When Daunte Culpepper was signed by the Dolphins, Las Vegas odds-makers elevated the Dolphins' Super Bowl chances from 25-to-1 to 10-to-1. *Since the Dolphins last played in the AFC Championship Game in 1992, all but three AFC teams have made it that far.

It is the only member of the genus Kannabateomys. Description The Atlantic bamboo rat can reach a head-and- body length of with a tail of . Its weight is about . The pelage is the typical agouti brown-to-grey colour of many rodents, grading to chestnut on the flanks. The chin and underparts are white tinged with reddish brown. The first of the tail are well-haired but the rest is sparsely haired. There is a distinct tuft of hairs at the tip. When fully grown, this bamboo rat with its long tail is unlikely to be mistaken for any other species. Etymology The genus name Kannabateomys derives from the three ancient greek words (), meaning \\"reed, cane\\", (), meaning \\"to mount\\", and (), meaning \\"mouse, rat\\". The species name amblyonyx derives from the two ancient greek words (), meaning \\"blunt, not sharp\\", and (), meaning \\"claw, fingernail\\". Distribution and habitat This species is native to South America, where its range includes southeastern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and northeastern Argentina. Typical habitat is moist forests near water with dense understorey of bamboos. It is particularly associated with the giant bamboo Guadua angustifolia, which forms thickets.Londoño, X. 2000. Guadua. In E. J. Judziewicz, R. J. Soreng, G. Davidse, P. M. Peterson, T. S. Filgueiras & F. O. Zuloaga (eds.) Catalogue of New World Grasses (Poaceae): I. Subfamilies Anomochlooideae, Bambusoideae, Ehrhartoideae, and Pharoideae, Contributions from the United States National Herbarium 39: 58–62. Smithsonian Institution, Washington Ecology The Atlantic bamboo rat is nocturnal and is highly arboreal, scrambling around in trees and bamboos, especially near water. The home range is about . When alarmed it issues loud squeals. It probably feeds on grasses, leaves, shoots, fruits and tubers. Phylogeny Kannabateomys is a member of the Echimyini clade of arboreal Echimyidae rodents. Its closest relatives are Dactylomys and Olallamys. These South American bamboo rats share unique features and are grouped under the informal clade name of \\"Dactylomyines\\". The dactylomyines are the sister genera to Diplomys and Santamartamys. All these taxa are closely related to the genera Echimys, Phyllomys, Makalata, Pattonomys, and Toromys. In turn, these genera share phylogenetic affinities with the clade containing Lonchothrix and Mesomys, and with Isothrix. Status K. amblyonyx is not a common species. In the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, for example, it has been recorded as having a density of just over four individuals per square kilometre. As a nocturnal animal it is seldom seen, but it has an extensive range and is presumed to have a large total population. In some places, such as in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil, it is threatened locally by forest clearance, but other specific threats have not been identified and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as \\"least concern\\".

Helen Richey (1909–1947) was a pioneering female aviator and the first woman to be hired as a pilot by a commercial airline in the United States. Richey was born in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. She graduated from McKeesport High School in 1927. Her father, Joseph B. Richey, was superintendent of schools in McKeesport from 1902 to 1935. During her teens, Richey was one of the few girls in McKeesport who wore pants. She learned how to fly a plane at age 20. Her father bought her a Bird plane when she obtained her pilot's license. In December 1933 Richey partnered with another female pilot, Frances Marsalis, to set an endurance record by staying airborne for nearly 10 days over Miami, Florida, with midair refueling. Their aircraft was a Curtiss Thrush, named \\"Outdoor Girl\\" after its sponsor, a cosmetics brand. Marsalis had previously set an endurance record the previous year with Louise Thaden in another Thrush. The refuelling was achieved by opening the central hatch, grabbing a dangling hose out of a Curtiss Robin and shoving it into the gas tank, which Richey likened to \\"wrestling with a cobra in a hurricane\\". Marsalis was killed during the 1934 Women's Air Meet in Dayton. In 1934 Richey won the premier air race at the first National Air Meet for women in Dayton, Ohio. Also in 1934, Central Airlines, a Greensburg, Pennsylvania–based carrier that eventually became part of United Airlines, hired Richey as a pilot; she made her first regular civil flight with them on December 31, taking a Ford Trimotor on the Washington to Detroit route. She eventually was forced to step down from the cockpit by the all-male pilots union. In May 1936, Helen Richey, flying a light plane, set an international altitude record for aircraft weighing under .Lynch, Adam, \\"Hometown Heroine,\\" Aviation History, March 2012, p. 56. She reached during a flight from Congressional Airport to Endless Caverns Airport in New Market, Virginia. Richey flew the same plane that Benjamin King had flown to break the record previously. After leaving Central Airlines, Richey continued to perform at air shows. In 1936 she teamed with Amelia Earhart in a transcontinental air race, the Bendix Trophy Race. Richey and Earhart came in fifth, beating some all-male teams. Later, Richey flew with the British Air Transportation Auxiliary during World War II. In addition to being the first female commercial airline pilot, Richey also was the first woman sworn in to pilot air mail and one of the first female flight instructors. Richey died in her apartment in New York City on 7 January 1947, apparently from a pill overdose. Her death was ruled a suicide.

He is basically self-taught and began picking out tunes by ear. Inspired by musicians like Paco de Lucia, Leo Kottke and Carlos Santana, he was composing and performing throughout Italy by the age of 18. After making his debut recording in his homeland with his first album Bluerba in 1981 and Silk and Steel two years later – both with fellow players that appreciated American bluegrass and new acoustic styles – D'Agostino took the bold leap and moved to America in 1985. Starting out by performing in the streets and on Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, he graduated to playing in restaurants then clubs, and finally, concert halls and festivals after a fellow musician introduced D’Agostino to a booking agent. He made his American recording debut in 1987 with Acoustic Spirit on Shanachie Records. Career Peppino D’Agostino emerged on the acoustic guitar scene in the late 1980s and was part of the second wave of great acoustic fingerstylists that helped redefine the instrument in the 1990s. His virtuosic and emotional playing is a prime influence on today's younger generation of fingerstyle guitarists, but D’Agostino has continued to evolve and grow in ways that would have been hard to predict when he was blowing minds with the intensity and beauty of his playing on albums like Acoustic Spirit, Close to the Heart, and Nine White Kites. In 2017 Guitar Player listed him as one of the 50 transcendent superheroes of the acoustic guitar. The CD “Every Step of The Way” was awarded by Acoustic Guitar's People's Choice Awards with a bronze medal for Best Acoustic Album of All Time. His signature Seagull acoustic guitar has been voted among the ten best signature guitars by Guitar Player magazine. Peppino gives guitar workshops, master classes and seminars worldwide. Top leading publishers such as Truefire, Alfred Publishing, Hal Leonard and Acoustic Guitar Magazine Books have published his compositions and instructional methods. In addition to regular worldwide live performances, D’Agostino has released ten albums of original compositions in the US, five collaborations albums one with electric guitarist Corrado Rustici, one with electric guitarist Stef Burns one with classical guitarist David Tanenbaum one with the World Guitar Ensemble and one with the Pacific Guitar Ensemble) and three DVDs. He has been featured on numerous guitar samplers, and has written numerous guitar instructional books and videos. In 1997 he wrote, composed and produced a soundtrack for the feature length Italian movie Ardena, directed by Luca Barbareschi. In 2016 he composed, arranged and recorded the original score for a 15-minute auditorium program for the Monterey Bay Aquarium. To date Peppino has recorded 18 CD's, performed in over thirty three countries at international festivals and concert halls. He has shared the stage with such greats as Larry Carlton, Eric Johnson, Tommy Emmanuel, Leo Kottke, Martin Taylor, Roland Dyens, and many more.

It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. Etymology The etymology of the species name corresponds to the Latin word ' meaning bristly. Systematics Illustration, 1876 The description of Mesomys hispidus was conducted on a specimen collected by the naturalist Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira during his travels in Amazonian Brazil, hence the species name. Initially deposited in the Museu Real d'Ajuda of Portugal, it has been brought to Paris in 1808 after the plundering of Lisbon by the armies of Napoleon. Then, in 1817, Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest described the species based on this specimen housed in the National Museum of Natural History (France) of Paris. Using ancient DNA technology, a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene has been sequenced from a small skin fragment of this holotype. DNA sequence comparisons then suggested that the specimen was originally obtained in eastern Amazonia north of the Amazon River, most likely in the Brazilian state of Amapá.

The Order was founded under the Rule of Saint Augustine, thus its members are classified as \\"Augustinians,\\" as are all other Orders of Canons Regular. History Monastery of the Holy Cross of Coimbra was the first house of the order; from the 16th century it constituted one of the most important cultural centers of Portugal The Canons Regular of the Holy Cross of Coimbra were founded by St. Theotonius, Archdeacon Dom Tello, and Dom Juan Peculiar\\"Peculiar\\" was truly Dom Juan's last name according to the references used for this article; it is not an editorial mistake in 1131. Construction of its first monastery began on June 28, 1131. On Ash Wednesday, February 24, 1132, the original twelve, along with sixty others who had joined them, made their profession of vows and received the habit. That same day Theotonius was elected Superior. They adopted the customs of the Canons Regular of St. Ruf and in addition to the choral office undertook the pastoral care of neighboring parishes. Under Theotonius, the community flourished, and other houses were added. Hospices at Coimbra and Penela served numerous migrants and travelers. The order enjoyed widespread support, and received privileges and royal patronage. Their success however stirred up considerable jealousy among the cathedral canons and local Bishop. Saint Charles Borromeo was named Cardinal protector of the Order.Keogh, William. \\"St. Charles Borromeo.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 11 Jan. 2015 Besides offering the sacred liturgy and pastoral work, the canons wrote historical works on Portugal and translated medical works from Arabic. Eventually all the various regional communities of canons regular in Portugal came to be a part of this Order. Evangelization The Order of the Holy Cross were entrusted with the mission of the re-evangelization of the territories reclaimed from the Moors.\\"History of the Order of the Holy Cross\\", Opus Sanctorum Angelorum It received official papal approval on May 5, 1135, from Pope Innocent II. In 1136 Theotonius sent a group of the Canons to the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows in the area of Leiria, Portugal. Four years later, the Moors besieged the Castle of Leiria. The Canons were captured and killed. During this same year Theotonius is said to have consecrated Portugal to the Archangel Michael. In 1154 Dom Pedro and Dom Alfonso and their companions were martyred in Morocco. In 1158 the Monastery of the Holy Martyr Romanus was burned by the Moors; the community of eight canons and their Prior perished. Anthony of Lisbon was a member of this Order before he left them to join the newly founded Franciscans. Suppression Over time struggles between the bishops and various houses and internal dissension among the houses grew. Attempts at reform were made sporadically throughout the 15th and early 16th centuries, the result of which was the suppression or transference of many canonical houses to other orders. By the end of the 18th century, the congregation had slipped into decadence, several houses had been suppressed and in 1791 the Commission to Examine Religious Orders closed almost all novitiates in Portugal. The French invasion and occupation of Portugal (1807-11) left the canons further diminished. However they held on for a few more years until the decree of final dissolution in 1834 by the Portuguese government. Revival In 1977, a movement called the Work of the Holy Angels began to work to restore the Order, which was approved in 1979 by Saint Pope John Paul II.\\"History\\", Order of the Canons Regular of the Holy Cross The letters \\"O.R.C.\\"' represent membership in this Order.

In Europe, it was released for Windows on June 20, 2003, and the GameCube and Xbox on March 4, 2005. A PlayStation 2 version was also planned, but it was cancelled for unknown reasons. The game was released for Windows in the United States on September 22, 2003. On October 8, 2020, a remastered compilation of the first 2 games called Neighbours Back From Hell had been released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It features increased framerate and HD visuals. Plot Woody is an average man who has a happy life, until his neighbor Mr. Rottweiler makes his life miserable. Woody decides to take full revenge on Mr. Rottweiler and calls up a TV crew, which produces the self-titled reality show that shows the neighbor's relations from worst sight. Gameplay In the game, the player plays as Woody, who creeps around the Rottweiler's house performing tricks upon the unsuspecting resident. Woody is the star of a new TV show with the same name, with cameras that track every move as the player sets traps such as sawing the chair, banana peels/soap on the floor, smeared paintings and messing with home equipment. The game's objectives are to create disarray, increase ratings, and win awards. Obstacles in the game include the watchful neighbour himself, also - his guard dog, and a parrot called Chilli, both of whom will try to alert the neighbour of Woody's presence. If Woody is caught by the Rottweiler, he is shown being brutally beaten and it is implied that Woody will be beaten to death. Then the episode is failed and player must restart the level. Each level's goal is to play some crude tricks on your neighbor by using every item near the player's character. Each stage has 4 or 5 zones (not including the training stages). Woody must move from zone to zone, as well as hide under the bed and in wardrobe to avoid caught. The neighbor moves in the house by his own routine, which can be disrupted in different ways (such as call him to make him go downstairs) or he gets distracted automatically (for example, painting, washing clothes and so on). The game starts with only few rooms (the hall, bathroom, kitchen and the living room), but as the game progresses, more rooms are unlocked (in Season 2 is the balcony and bedroom, and in Season 3 is the basement and study), making the game more difficult. Reception The PC version received \\"average\\" reviews, while the GameCube and Xbox versions received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\", according to the review aggeregation website Metacritic.  Legacy   Ports and re-releases  The original Microsoft Windows version was digitally re-released on GOG.com with its sequel by JoWood on June 9, 2009. It was released on Steam by Nordic Games on November 7, 2013 after successfully getting Greenlit by the community. A mobile port of the game was released worldwide by THQ Nordic for iOS and Android on May 25, 2017 on the App Store and Google Play, respectively. A port for macOS was released on the App Store on June 22, 2017. Sequel In 2004 a sequel was released, called Neighbours from Hell 2: On Vacation. In this game, instead of being in a house, the player travels to various locations around the world. This time the player must have their caution turned to the mom of the Neighbour as well, if they do not want to be caught.

Hetland (1947-2006) was a nationally recognized artist from Fargo, ND, known particularly for his liturgical works in mosaic and stained glass.  Biography Hetland studied under regionalist painter Cyrus M. Running (1913-1976) while a student at Concordia College, Moorhead, Minnesota, graduating in 1969. In 1965 Hetland began working on the Concordia Christmas Concert murals, taking over the role as designer in 1978. The Christmas Concert murals, 56-foot by 20-foot, were painted in each year by volunteers in paint-by-numbers fashion. More than 20,000 people would see the murals at Concordia’s Memorial Auditorium and Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis. Hetland also served as director for Concordia’s Office of Communications from 1974 to 1982 and director of special projects since 1982. After dealing with life- threatening illnesses for the last eight years of his life, he died on Easter Sunday, April 16, 2006  Art  One of Hetlands's best-known works was the Jerusalem Cross, commissioned by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America for presentation to world leaders, including Pope John Paul II. One of his mosaics hangs in the entrance of the ELCA's churchwide offices in Chicago. Hetland also created stained glass windows, altars, pulpits, mosaics, banners and crosses for numerous churches in North Dakota and Minnesota. He designed Concordia’s president’s medallion in 1980 and a mosaic mural for the library in 1981. Awards and honors Hetland received a BENE award in Ministry & Liturgy magazine’s national 2003-04 Visual Arts Awards for his design for the 2001 Concordia Christmas Concert Mural. In 2000, he received the Concordia Alumni Achievement award, the highest honor bestowed on alumni, and in 1994 the college presented him with an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree.

Meek also writes musical and other occasional features on persons such as trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and American composer Joseph Byrd for publication in print and online, and is the author of online blogs dealing with media and music. Meek has also served as a media consultant for interests worldwide including the Fox Broadcasting Network, Swedish Televerket and numerous Fortune 500 companies, and is an expert witness certified by the United States Supreme Court on media and copyright issues related to cable television and broadcast television. Life and career Meek originally began involvement in media by doing volunteer music programming at WIOT-FM at age 12. He then extended his involvement in music by serving as a DJ and sound and light engineer at the Catacombs Coffee House in Sylvania, Ohio from 1969-72. Meek began his television career while still in high school as a producer for WSPD-TV in Toledo, Ohio in 1973. He also served as an Ohio county-level student coordinator in the 1972 presidential campaign of Senator George McGovern. He moved to Columbus, Ohio in 1976, where he worked as a music buyer for the Peaches Records chain. After spending a year in Boston, Massachusetts at Grahm Junior College in 1978-79, Meek moved to Gainesville, Florida and graduated from the University of Florida in 1982 with a degree in Communications while working at WUFT-TV and other media positions at the university from 1980-82. In his final semester Meek helped launch a new graduate level communications degree program, serving as director and co- producer of a drama \\"Ernie Pyle, Here Is My War\\", winner of the 1982 Alpha Epsilon Rho Grand Prize for Drama. Although he initially planned to pursue a journalism master's degree in Gainesville, Meek immediately began working as a producer and researcher at WFTV-TV, Orlando when offered a job in May, 1982. After two years producing a morning news and information program, he was hired at WOFL-TV in April, 1984, initially as Community Affairs Director, then as Station Operations Manager beginning in 1986. While at WOFL-TV, Meek wrote, produced and edited a number of documentaries, including a program on Louis Comfort Tiffany and the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art in Winter Park, Florida which was credited with helping keep the Morse collections intact for an eventual larger museum, and a program on the introduction of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) into Central Florida, which won a medal at the New York International Film & Television Festival in 1984. Meek's television producing experience exceeds 500 programs including documentaries, information, telethons, talk and public service, several thousand program segments, and serving as Executive Producer for thousands more news and public service programs. In 1987, at the request of several television stations, law firms and the Fox Broadcasting Network, Meek began a consulting practice in issues related to cable-broadcast television issues, which expanded to include a wide range of areas related to copyright, TV and radio station startups, disaster and strategic plans, Nielsen ratings, FAA airspace issues, digital television, tower construction and zoning issues, writing for print and television, multimedia production and other media issues. In 1989 Meek produced and moderated a set of four nationwide seminars for the NATPE Educational Foundation, which were seen as a groundbreaking effort to bring leaders of the broadcasting and cable industries directly together in a day- long event for the first time. In 1998 Meek expanded his consulting practice again to include computers, networks and Web design, with an additional added emphasis on skills training and Intranet/Internet Web-based collaboration. Meek was repeatedly cited in the 1997 United States Supreme Court decision Turner Broadcasting vs. FCC, which established the must-carry rules regarding cable carriage of broadcast television stations in the United States, where Meek represented the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), United States Department of Justice, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), the Association of Local Television Stations (ALTV), and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), among others. Meek also produced research used by the U.S. Congress in passing the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1988 governing the carriage of local television stations by Direct broadcast satellite providers. Meek has also been heavily involved in the rules governing syndicated program exclusivity (\\"Syndex\\") for broadcast television and \\"superstations\\" such as WGN-TV and WTBS-TV, submitting research in the United Video case which ruled in favor of Syndex . Meek maintains a Web page at the TVCCS site used by students and college classes in the U.S. concerning the history of must-carry and the Turner decision. Meek is also a frequent guest on the WUFT-FM (Gainesville, FL) program \\"Conner Calling\\", hosted by Hank Conner, and has offered personal, online and satellite presentations to technical groups, professional and trade organizations, private business, museum docents, civic groups and secondary and college audiences nationwide on the use of the Internet, communications, computers, mobile television, public service rules for broadcast television, Louis Comfort Tiffany, television ratings, journalism and the history of must-carry and the Turner case for the past twenty years. Meek also authors two blogs on media issues, \\"Reflections On Media\\" featuring information and reviews of recent media and music subjects, and \\"The Video Audio Overdose Galore\\" highlighting music and entertainment videos from online video and audio services. He is also the founder and moderator of CateraOwners, the world's largest owners group dedicated to the Cadillac Catera automobile, with more than 2000 members worldwide. In 2007 Meek began authoring a weekly music events blog, \\"About & Out\\", for the Los- Angeles based music Web site LAJazz.com.

Definitions Let X be a locally compact Hausdorff space with a countable base. Let C0(X) denote the space of all real- valued continuous functions on X that vanish at infinity, equipped with the sup-norm f . From analysis, we know that C0(X) with the sup norm is a Banach space. A Feller semigroup on C0(X) is a collection {Tt}t ≥ 0 of positive linear maps from C0(X) to itself such that * Ttf  ≤ f  for all t ≥ 0 and f in C0(X), i.e., it is a contraction (in the weak sense); * the semigroup property: Tt + s = Tt oTs for all s, t ≥ 0; * limt → 0Ttf − f  = 0 for every f in C0(X). Using the semigroup property, this is equivalent to the map Ttf from t in [0,∞) to C0(X) being right continuous for every f. Warning: This terminology is not uniform across the literature. In particular, the assumption that Tt maps C0(X) into itself is replaced by some authors by the condition that it maps Cb(X), the space of bounded continuous functions, into itself. The reason for this is twofold: first, it allows including processes that enter \\"from infinity\\" in finite time. Second, it is more suitable to the treatment of spaces that are not locally compact and for which the notion of \\"vanishing at infinity\\" makes no sense. A Feller transition function is a probability transition function associated with a Feller semigroup. A Feller process is a Markov process with a Feller transition function.  Generator  Feller processes (or transition semigroups) can be described by their infinitesimal generator. A function f in C0 is said to be in the domain of the generator if the uniform limit : Af = \\\\lim_{t\\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{T_tf - f}{t}, exists. The operator A is the generator of Tt, and the space of functions on which it is defined is written as DA. A characterization of operators that can occur as the infinitesimal generator of Feller processes is given by the Hille-Yosida theorem. This uses the resolvent of the Feller semigroup, defined below.  Resolvent  The resolvent of a Feller process (or semigroup) is a collection of maps (Rλ)λ > 0 from C0(X) to itself defined by :R_\\\\lambda f = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-\\\\lambda t}T_t f\\\\,dt. It can be shown that it satisfies the identity :R_\\\\lambda R_\\\\mu = R_\\\\mu R_\\\\lambda = (R_\\\\mu- R_\\\\lambda)/(\\\\lambda-\\\\mu). Furthermore, for any fixed λ > 0, the image of Rλ is equal to the domain DA of the generator A, and : \\\\begin{align} & R_\\\\lambda = (\\\\lambda - A)^{-1}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ & A = \\\\lambda - R_\\\\lambda^{-1}. \\\\end{align}  Examples  * Brownian motion and the Poisson process are examples of Feller processes. More generally, every Lévy process is a Feller process. * Bessel processes are Feller processes. * Solutions to stochastic differential equations with Lipschitz continuous coefficients are Feller processes. * Every adapted right continuous Feller process on probability space (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{F}, (\\\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\\\geq 0})\\\\- satisfies the strong Markov property with respect to the filtration (\\\\mathcal{F}_{t^+})_{t\\\\geq 0}, i.e. for each (\\\\mathcal{F}_{t^+})_{t\\\\geq 0}-stopping time \\\\tau, conditioned on the event \\\\\\\\{\\\\tau < \\\\infty\\\\\\\\}, we have that for each t\\\\ge 0, X_{\\\\tau + t} is independent of \\\\mathcal{F}_{\\\\tau^+} given X_\\\\tau.Rogers, L.C.G. and Williams, David Diffusions, Markov Processes and Martingales volume One: Foundations, second edition, John Wiley and Sons Ltd, 1979.

Trained in the phenomenological tradition, he developed a philosophical anthropology for the age of technology, focusing on such themes as the effects of mass media on our emotional and ethical existence, the illogic of religion, the nuclear threat, the Shoah, and the question of being a philosopher. In 1992, shortly before his death, Günther Anders was awarded the Sigmund Freud Prize.  Biography  216x216px At the time of his birth his native Breslau (now Wrocław in Poland) had become the 6th largest city in the German Empire, with a Jewish population of about 20,000, 5% of the city's population.Baedeker, Karl, Northern Germany, 14th revised edition, Leipzig & London, 1904, p.185. He was the son of founders of child developmental psychology Clara and William Stern as well as a cousin of Walter Benjamin. Anders was married three times, to the German philosopher and political scientist Hannah Arendt from 1929 to 1937, to the Austrian writer Elisabeth Freundlich from 1945 to 1955, and to American pianist Charlotte Lois Zelka in 1957. Zelka was born in California in 1930, toured Europe for two decades, and died of lung cancer in 2001.Harold Marcuse In 1923 Anders obtained a PhD in philosophy; Edmund Husserl was his dissertation advisor. Anders' sister Hilde Stern was at one time married to the German philosopher Rudolf Schottlaender, who was also a student of Husserl. However Anders' own father was arguably the most significant intellectual influence in his life. While he was working as a journalist in Berlin, an editor did not want so many Jewish-sounding bylines in his paper, so Stern chose the name \\"Anders\\" (meaning other or different). He used that nom-de-plume for the rest of his life. In the late 1920s Anders studied with the philosopher Martin Heidegger in Freiburg. He married fellow Heidegger student Hannah Arendt, who had engaged in an affair with their common mentor. Anders fled Nazi Germany in 1933, first to France (where he and Arendt divorced amicably in 1937), and later to the United States. Anders returned to Europe in 1950 with his second wife (1906-2001), whom he had met in New York, to live in her native Vienna. There Anders wrote his main philosophical work, whose title translates as The Obsolescence of Humankind (1956), became a leading figure in the anti-nuclear movement, and published numerous essays and expanded versions of his diaries, including one of a trip to Breslau and Auschwitz with his wife. Anders' papers are held by the University of Vienna, and his literary executor is former FORVM editor Gerhard Oberschlick. Anders was an atheist.  Work  Günther Anders was an early critic of the role of technology in modern life and in this context was a trenchant critic of the role of television. His essay \\"The Phantom World of TV,\\" written in the late 1950s, was published in an edition of Bernard Rosenberg and David Manning White's influential anthology Mass Culture as \\"The Phantom World of Television.\\" In it he details how the televisual experience substitutes images for experience, leading people to eschew first-hand experiences in the world and instead become \\"voyeurs,\\" His dominant metaphor in this essay centers on how television interposes itself between family members \\"at the dinner table.\\" See \\"Die Welt als Phantom und Matrize. Philosophische Betrachtungen über Rundfunk und Fernsehen\\" (The World as Phantom and Matrix. Philosophical Observations on Radio and Television) (1956). The Obsolescence of Humankind His major work, of which only a few essays have been translated into English,'On Promethean Shame', in Christopher Müller, Prometheanism: Technology, Digital Culture and Human Obsolescence (Rowman and Litlefield, 2016), pp. 29-95; Günther Anders, 'The Obsolescence of Privacy', CounterText 3:1 is acknowledged to be Die Antiquiertheit des Menschen (literally \\"The Outdatedness of the Human Species,\\" 1956; vol. 2 1980). It argues that a gap has developed between humanity's technologically enhanced capacity to create and destroy, and our ability to imagine that destruction. Anders devoted a great deal of attention to the nuclear threat, making him an early critic of this technology as well. The two volume work is made up of a string of philosophical essays that start with an observation often found in Anders' diary entries dating back to his exile in the U.S. in the 1940s. To provide an example from the first chapter of volume one: \\"First Encounter with Promethean Shame – Today's Prometheus asks: 'Who am I anyway?'\\"; 11 March 1942. \\"Shame about the 'embarrassingly' high quality of manufactured goods.\\" What are we embarrassed about? Anders' answer to this question is simply \\"that we were born and not manufactured.\\"for a full translation see: Günther Anders, 'On Promethean Shame', in Christopher Müller, Prometheanism: Technology, Digital Culture and Human Obsolescence (Rowman and Litlefield, 2016), pp. 29-95 Open Letter to Klaus Eichmann Just as Arendt in her Eichmann in Jerusalem elucidated the Banality of Evil by declaring that horrendous crimes can be committed by quite ordinary people, Anders explores the moral and ethical ramifications of the facts brought to light in the 1960-61 trial of Adolf Eichmann in We Sons of Eichmann: Open Letter to Klaus Eichmann (the son of the noted Nazi bureaucrat and genocidaire). He suggests that the appellation \\"Eichmann\\" properly designates any person who actively participated in, ignored or failed to learn about, or even knew about but took no action against the Nazis' mass murder campaigns against Jews and others. He explained to his audience in Austria and Germany, among them young writers searching for ways to empathize with their parents' generation, that \\"there was but one viable alternative not only for Eichmann's son Klaus but all 'Eichmann sons,' namely to repudiate their fathers since mourning them was not an option.\\"Dagmar Lorenz. The Established Outsider: Bernhard. in: The Companion to the Works of Thomas Bernhard. Camden House, 2002. (Studies in German Literature, Linguistics, and Culture) Matthias Konzett editor.  Quotes by and about Anders Foreword. \\"Outdatedness of Human Beings 1\\", 5th edition \\"The three main theses: that we are no match for the perfection of our products; that we produce more than we can visualize and take responsibility for; and that we believe, that, what we can do, are allowed to do, no: should do, no: must do – these three basic theses, in light of the environmental threats emerging over the last quarter century, have become more prevailing and urgent than they were then.\\" Changing the world \\"It does not suffice to change the world. We do that anyway. And to a large extent that happens even without our involvement. In addition we have to interpret this change. Precisely in order to change it. So that the world does not change without us. And ultimately into a world without us.\\" Introduction. \\"Outdatedness of Human Beings 2\\" This volume is \\"...a philosophical anthropology in the age of technocracy\\". With \\"technocracy\\" I do not mean the rule of technocrats (as if they were a group of specialists, who dominate today's politics), but the fact, that the world, in which we live and which determines us, is a technological one – which extends so far, that we are not allowed to say, that in our historical situation there is among other things technology, rather do we have to say: within the world's status called \\"technology\\" history happens, in other words technology has become the subject of history, in which we are only \\"co- historical\\". Dedication. \\"Outdatedness of Human Beings 1\\", 5th edition Exactly half a century ago, in nineteen hundred and six, my father William Stern published, then twenty years younger and generations more confident than his son today, the first volume of his work \\"Person and Thing.\\" His hope, to rehabilitate the \\"Person\\" through his struggle against an impersonal Psychology, he only unwillingly would have seen dashed. His very own kindness and the optimism of the times, to which he belonged, prevented him for many years, to understand that what makes a \\"Person\\" a \\"Thing\\", is not its scientific treatment; but the actual treatment of one human being by another. When overnight he was dishonored and chased away by the spurners of humanity, he was not spared the grief that comes from a better understanding into a world worse off. In memory of him, who indelibly implanted the idea of human dignity in his son, these mournful pages on the devastation of human beings were written. Love Yesterday. Notes on the History of Feelings. 1986. Without knights no chivalry, without court no courtliness, without salon no charm, without material support no deference will last indefinitely, not even as make-believe. In the same manner what shrinks in a world that cheats us out of leisure and other preconditions of our privacy, are the subtleties of our emotional private lives. Jewish Origins. In: Paul van Dijk, Anthropology in the Age of Technology. \\"His Jewish self-consciousness reveals itself in the acknowledgment that he is never more ashamed than when meeting a Jew who is ashamed to be a Jew. The Judaism that Anders represents with the fierceness and decisiveness that is so characteristic of him is, however, a modern, secular, and humanistic Judaism.\\"  Bibliography  * The Outdatedness of Human Beings 1.

He is a founding member of the Workers' Party. Early political career (1961-1989) Dutra graduated in Grammar school and became an employee of Banrisul, Rio Grande do Sul's then state owned bank, on 1961. In that position, he became familiarized with the Porto Alegre Bank Workers Union. He was elected president of the organization in 1975. On 1979 he organized a major strike of the government employees. For that reason, he was arrested by the political police of the military dictatorship and lost his term as the union's president. During the redemocratization of Brazilian politics, Dutra participated of the foundation of the Workers' Party section in his state, of which he was the president from 1980 to 1986. On the 1982 gubernatorial elections, the first in over twenty years, he was released as the Workers' Party candidate. He received unexpressive voting, coming in last place with more than 50,000 votes. In 1986, Dutra was elected Constitutional Congressman with over 55,000 votes. During the time in which he lived in Brasília, Dutra shared an apartment with Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, also a Congressman and the future President of Brazil. Since then, they are close friends. Mayor of Porto Alegre (1989–1993) In 1988, contradicting all opinion polls, Dutra was elected mayor of Porto Alegre with 34% of the votes. Differently from nowadays, at that time Brazilian electoral law did not allow the dispute of a second round if any of the candidates failed to achieve more than half of the valid votes. According to the polls, Congressman Antônio Britto from the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party was the favorite candidate among the population by a large margin. Britto ended up the dispute in third place, underneath fellow Congressman Carlos Araújo (then husband of Dilma Rousseff) of the Democratic Labour Party. Araújo belonged to the same party as the city's mayor at the time, Alceu Collares, but failed to gather his electorate. Dutra's term as mayor of Porto Alegre, starting in 1989 and ending in 1992, was the first of four consecutive terms of the Workers' Party in the city, totaling 16 years of administration. Because of that, Porto Alegre became a sort of display cabinet for the party in the rest of Brazil: A place where it experimented successful and innovative initiatives. Nevertheless, Dutra's administration was criticized for its intervention on the public transportation system, what generated bad relations between the City Hall and the bus concessionaire companies, forcing the government to pay them an indemnification. After his term as mayor had ended, in 1994, Dutra tried the governorship for a second time. He obtained 35% of the votes on the first round and 47.79% on the second. He lost the office to Britto by a margin of less than 5% of the valid votes. Governor of Rio Grande do Sul (1999-2003) In 1998, Britto tried the re-election and faced Dutra for a third time. Dutra's campaign focused on criticizing Britto's actions perceived as neoliberal politics, such as the privatization of the state owned telephony and energy companies. This time, Dutra won the election on second round by a small margin of only 97 thousand votes. Dutra's term as governor, from 1999 to 2003, was marked by the suspension of a deal established by Britto's administration concerning the opening of two car manufacturing companies in the state (General Motors and Ford). The deal included high tax exemption and flotation with interest rate below the market for the companies. The renegotiation proposed by Dutra was only accepted by GM. Other accomplishments of his administration include the creation of a State University and the introduction of the participatory budgeting at state level, following the previous experience of its implementation in Porto Alegre by his party. Suffering from a large defamation campaign, promoted mainly by RBS media conglomerate (Rede Globo's local affiliate), as soon as a corruption scandal involving the Workers' Party and the Jogo do Bicho erupted, and without the majority in the State Assembly, where he faced major defeats, Dutra was politically worn out near his term's end. As a result, Dutra's reelection campaign was rejected in the Workers' Party primaries, where then Mayor of Porto Alegre Tarso Genro was selected to represent the party. Genro would be defeated by a margin of 5% in the second round by Germano Rigotto from the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party. Recent political activity (2003-present) In 2002, Luís Inácio Lula da Silva was elected president, and appointed Dutra as Minister of Cities, a then recently created office. He would remain on this job until 2005, when Lula needed to reorganize the Brazilian cabinet to suit the Progressive Party in it. Dutra was then replaced by Márcio Fortes in a negotiation of the government with then President of the Congress Severino Cavalcanti. In 2006, Dutra was the Workers' Party gubernatorial candidate for Rio Grande do Sul for a fourth time. He was defeated by then Congresswoman Yeda Crusius of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party on a second round by a margin of 7.88% of the votes.

The US$100-million Roadrunner was designed for a peak performance of 1.7 petaflops. It achieved 1.026 petaflops on May 25, 2008, to become the world's first TOP500 LINPACK sustained 1.0 petaflops system. In November 2008, it reached a top performance of 1.456 petaFLOPS, retaining its top spot in the TOP500 list. It was also the fourth-most energy- efficient supercomputer in the world on the Supermicro Green500 list, with an operational rate of 444.94 megaflops per watt of power used. The hybrid Roadrunner design was then reused for several other energy efficient supercomputers. Roadrunner was decommissioned by Los Alamos on March 31, 2013. In its place, Los Alamos commissioned a supercomputer called Cielo, which was installed in 2010. Overview IBM built the computer for the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration. It was a hybrid design with 12,960 IBM PowerXCell 8i and 6,480 AMD Opteron dual-core processors in specially designed blade servers connected by InfiniBand. The Roadrunner used Red Hat Enterprise Linux along with Fedora as its operating systems and was managed with xCAT distributed computing software. It also used the Open MPI Message Passing Interface implementation. Roadrunner occupied approximately 296 server racks which covered and became operational in 2008. It was decommissioned March 31, 2013. The DOE used the computer for simulating how nuclear materials age in order to predict whether the USA's aging arsenal of nuclear weapons are both safe and reliable. Other uses for the Roadrunner included the science, financial, automotive and aerospace industries. Hybrid design Roadrunner differed from other contemporary supercomputers because it continued the hybrid approach to supercomputer design introduced by Seymour Cray in 1964 with the Control Data Corporation CDC 6600 and continued with the order of magnitude faster CDC 7600 in 1969. However, in this architecture the peripheral processors were used only for operating system functions and all applications ran in the one central processor. Most previous supercomputers had only used one processor architecture, since it was thought to be easier to design and program for. To realize the full potential of Roadrunner, all software had to be written specially for this hybrid architecture. The hybrid design consisted of dual-core Opteron server processors manufactured by AMD using the standard AMD64 architecture. Attached to each Opteron core is an IBM-designed and -fabricated PowerXCell 8i processor. As a supercomputer, the Roadrunner was considered an Opteron cluster with Cell accelerators, as each node consists of a Cell attached to an Opteron core and the Opterons to each other. Development Roadrunner was in development from 2002 and went online in 2006. Due to its novel design and complexity it was constructed in three phases and became fully operational in 2008. Its predecessor was a machine also developed at Los Alamos named Dark Horse. This machine was one of the earliest hybrid architecture systems originally based on ARM and then moved to the Cell processor. It was entirely a 3D design, its design integrated 3D memory, networking, processors and a number of other technologies. Phase 1 The first phase of the Roadrunner was building a standard Opteron based cluster, while evaluating the feasibility to further construct and program the future hybrid version. This Phase 1 Roadrunner reached 71 teraflops and was in full operation at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2006. Phase 2 Phase 2 known as AAIS (Advanced Architecture Initial System) included building a small hybrid version of the finished system using an older version of the Cell processor. This phase was used to build prototype applications for the hybrid architecture. It went online in January 2007. Phase 3 The goal of Phase 3 was to reach sustained performance in excess of 1 petaflops. Additional Opteron nodes and new PowerXCell processors were added to the design. These PowerXCell processors are five times as powerful as the Cell processors used in Phase 2. It was built to full scale at IBM’s Poughkeepsie, New York facility, where it broke the 1 petaflops barrier during its fourth attempt on May 25, 2008. The complete system was moved to its permanent location in New Mexico in the summer of 2008. Technical specifications Processors Roadrunner used two different models of processors. The first is the AMD Opteron 2210, running at 1.8 GHz. Opterons are used both in the computational nodes feeding the Cells with useful data and in the system operations and communication nodes passing data between computing nodes and helping the operators running the system. Roadrunner has a total of 6,912 Opteron processors with 6,480 used for computation and 432 for operation. The Opterons are connected together by HyperTransport links. Each Opteron has two cores for a total 13,824 cores. The second processor is the IBM PowerXCell 8i, running at 3.2 GHz. These processors have one general purpose core (PPE), and eight special performance cores (SPE) for floating point operations. Roadrunner has a total of 12,960 PowerXCell processors, with 12,960 PPE cores and 103,680 SPE cores, for a total of 116,640 cores. TriBlade A schematic description of the TriBlade module. Logically, a TriBlade consists of two dual-core Opterons with 16 GB RAM and four PowerXCell 8i CPUs with 16 GB Cell RAM. Physically, a TriBlade consists of one LS21 Opteron blade, an expansion blade, and two QS22 Cell blades. The LS21 has two 1.8 GHz dual-core Opterons with 16 GB memory for the whole blade, providing 8GB for each CPU. Each QS22 has two PowerXCell 8i CPUs, running at 3.2 GHz and 8 GB memory, which makes 4 GB for each CPU. The expansion blade connects the two QS22 via four PCIe x8 links to the LS21, two links for each QS22. It also provides outside connectivity via an InfiniBand 4x DDR adapter. This makes a total width of four slots for a single TriBlade. Three TriBlades fit into one BladeCenter H chassis. The expansion blade is connected to the Opteron blade via HyperTransport. Connected Unit (CU) A Connected Unit is 60 BladeCenter H full of TriBlades, that is 180 TriBlades. All TriBlades are connected to a 288-port Voltaire ISR2012 Infiniband switch. Each CU also has access to the Panasas file system through twelve System x3755 servers. CU system information: * 360 dual-core Opterons with 2.88 TiB RAM. * 720 PowerXCell 8i cores with 2.88 TiB RAM. * 12 System x3755 with dual 10-GBit Ethernet each. * 288-port Voltaire ISR2012 switch with 192 Infiniband 4x DDR links (180 TriBlades and twelve I/O nodes). Roadrunner cluster A schematic overview of the tiered composition of the Roadrunner supercomputer cluster. The final cluster is made up of 18 connected units, which are connected via eight additional (second-stage) Infiniband ISR2012 switches. Each CU is connected through twelve uplinks for each second-stage switch, which makes a total of 96 uplink connections. Overall system information: * 6,480 Opteron processors with 51.8 TiB RAM (in 3,240 LS21 blades) * 12,960 Cell processors with 51.8 TiB RAM (in 6,480 QS22 blades) * 216 System x3755 I/O nodes * 26 288-port ISR2012 Infiniband 4x DDR switches * 296 racks * 2.345 MW power Shutdown IBM Roadrunner was shut down on March 31, 2013. While the supercomputer was one of the fastest in the world, its energy efficiency was relatively low. Roadrunner delivered 444 megaflops per watt vs the 886 megaflops per watt of a comparable supercomputer. Before the supercomputer is dismantled, researchers will spend one month performing memory and data routing experiments that will aid in designing future supercomputers. After IBM Roadrunner is dismantled, the electronics will be shredded. Los Alamos will perform the majority of the supercomputer's destruction, citing the classified nature of its calculations. Some of its parts will be retained for historical purposes.

It is self-limiting and usually only requires use of moisturizer creams. The condition is so named for the fine scaly appearance initially present (pityriasis), and alba (Latin for white) refers to the pallor of the patches that develop. The patches are not totally depigmented. Signs and symptoms The dry scaling appearance is most noticeable during the winter as a result of dry air inside people's homes. During the summer, tanning of the surrounding normal skin makes the pale patches of pityriasis alba more prominent. Individual lesions develop through 3 stages and sometimes are itchy: # Raised and red – although the redness is often mild and not noticed by parents # Raised and pale # Smooth flat pale patches Lesions are round or oval raised or flat, of 0.5–2 cm in size although may be larger if they occur on the body (up to 4 cm), and usually number from 4 or 5 to over 20. The patches are dry with very fine scales. They most commonly occur on the face (cheeks), but in 20% appear also on the upper arms, neck, or shoulders. The diagnostic differential should consider tinea and vitiligo amongst other causative factors. Cause Any dermatitis may heal leaving pale skin, as may excessive use of corticosteroid creams used to treat episodes of eczema. The hypopigmentation is due to both reduced activity of melanocytes with fewer and smaller melanosomes.Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . The cause of pityriasis alba is not known. Dry skin and atopic dermatitis may co-exist. The patches may become more apparent after sun exposure, when the normal surrounding skin is tanned. The role of ultraviolet radiation, bathing or not bathing, low serum copper and Malassezia yeasts is not clear. Diagnosis Diagnosis is mainly done by clinical examination. Shining a Wood's light over the skin may reveal further lesions not obviously visible otherwise. Differential diagnosis *Pytriasis versicolor and leprosy. Treatment No treatment is required and the patches in time will settle. The redness, scale and itch if present may be managed with simple emollients and sometimes hydrocortisone, a weak steroid, is also used. As the patches of pityriasis alba do not darken normally in sunlight, effective sun protection helps minimise the discrepancy in colouration against the surrounding normal skin. Cosmetic camouflage may be required. Tacrolimus has been reported as speeding resolution. In exceptionally severe cases PUVA therapy may be considered. Prognosis The patches of pityriasis alba may last from 1 month to about one year, but commonly on the face last a year.

The worldwide prevalence is 5% in children, with boys and girls affected equally. adults can also suffer from this disease. Up to a third of US school children may at some stage have this condition.

It involves cooling the body to temperatures between 20 °C (68 °F) to 25 °C (77 °F), and stopping blood circulation and brain function for up to one hour. It is used when blood circulation to the brain must be stopped because of delicate surgery within the brain, or because of surgery on large blood vessels that lead to or from the brain. DHCA is used to provide a better visual field during surgery due to the cessation of blood flow. DHCA is a form of carefully managed clinical death in which heartbeat and all brain activity cease. At normal body temperature of 37 °C only several minutes of stopped blood circulation causes changes within the brain leading to permanent damage after circulation is restored. Reducing body temperature extends the time interval that such stoppage can be survived. At a brain temperature of 14 °C, blood circulation can be safely stopped for 30 to 40 minutes. There is an increased incidence of brain injury at times longer than 40 minutes, but sometimes circulatory arrest for up to 60 minutes is used if life-saving surgery requires it. Infants tolerate longer periods of DHCA than adults. Applications of DHCA include repairs of the aortic arch, repairs to head and neck great vessels, repair of large cerebral aneurysms, repair of cerebral arteriovenous malformations, pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, and resection of tumors that have invaded the vena cava.  History  The use of hypothermia for medical purposes can date back to the Hippocrates, where they advocated packing snow and ice into wounds to reduce hemorrhage. The origin of hypothermia and neuroprotection was also observed in infants were exposed to cold due to abandonment and the prolonged viability of these infants. In the 1940s and 1950s, Canadian surgeon Wilfred Bigelow demonstrated in animal models that the length of time the brain could survive stopped blood circulation could be extended from 3 minutes to 10 minutes by cooling to 30 °C before circulation was stopped. He found that this time could be extended to 15 to 24 minutes at temperatures below 20 °C. He further found that at a temperature of 5 °C, groundhogs could endure two hours of stopped blood circulation without ill effects. This research was motivated by a desire to stop the heart from beating long enough to do surgery on the heart while it remained still. Since heart-lung machines, also known as cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), had not been invented yet, stopping the heart meant stopping blood circulation to the whole body, including the brain. The first heart surgery using hypothermia to provide a longer time that blood circulation through the whole body could be safely stopped was performed by F. John Lewis and Mansur Taufic at the University of Minnesota in 1952. In this procedure, the first successful open heart surgery, Lewis repaired an atrial septal defect in a 5-year-old girl during 5 minutes of total circulatory arrest at 28 °C. Many similar procedures were performed by Soviet heart surgeon, Eugene Meshalkin, in Novosibirsk during the 1960s. In these procedures, cooling was accomplished externally by applying cold water or melting ice to the surface of the body. The advent of cardiopulmonary bypass in the United States during the 1950s allowed the heart to be stopped for surgery without having to stop circulation to the rest of the body. Cooling more than a few degrees was no longer needed for heart surgery. Thereafter, the only surgeries that required stopping blood circulation to the whole body (\\"total circulatory arrest\\") were surgeries involving blood supply to the brain. The only heart surgeries that continued to require total circulatory arrest were repairs to the aortic arch. Cardiopulmonary bypass machines were essential to the development of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) in humans. By 1959, it was known from the animal experiments of Bigelow, Andjus and Smith, Gollan, Lewis's colleague, Niazi, and others that temperatures near 0 °C could be survived by mammals, and that colder temperature permitted the brain to survive longer circulatory arrest times, even beyond one hour. Humans had survived cooling to 9 °C, and circulatory arrest of 45 minutes, using external cooling only. However, reaching such low temperatures by external cooling was difficult and hazardous. At temperatures below 24 °C, the human heart is prone to fibrillation and stopping. This can begin circulatory arrest before the brain has reached a safe temperature. Cardiopulmonary bypass machines allow blood circulation and cooling to continue below the temperature at which the heart stops working. By cooling blood directly, cardiopulmonary bypass also cools people faster than surface cooling, even if the heart is not functioning. In 1959, using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), Barnes Woodhall and colleagues at Duke Medical Center performed the first brain surgery using DHCA, a tumor resection, at a brain temperature of 11 °C and esophageal temperature of 4 °C. This was quickly followed by use of DHCA by Alfred Uihlein and other surgeons for treatment of large cerebral aneurysms, another neurosurgical procedure, for which DHCA is still used today. In 1963, Christiaan Barnard and Velva Schrire were the first to use DHCA to repair an aortic aneurysm, cooling the patient to 10 °C. Randall B. Griepp, in 1975, is generally credited with demonstrating DHCA as a safe and practical approach for aortic arch surgery. Mechanism of brain protection Cells require energy to operate membrane ion pumps and other mechanisms of cellular homeostasis. Cold reduces the metabolic rate of cells, which conserves energy stores (ATP) and oxygen needed to produce energy. Cold therefore extends the length of time that cells can maintain homeostasis and avoid damaging hypoxia and anaerobic glycolysis by conserving local resources when blood circulation is stopped and unable to deliver fresh oxygen and glucose to make more energy. Normally 60% of brain oxygen utilization (CMRO2) consists of energy generation for the neuronal action potentials of brain electrical activity. A key principle of DHCA is total inactivation of the brain by cooling, as verified by \\"flatline\\" isoelectric EEG, also called electrocerebral silence (ECS). Instead of a continuous decrease in activity as the brain is cooled, electrical activity decreases in discontinuous steps. In the human brain, a type of reduced activity called burst suppression occurs at a mean temperature of 24 °C, and electrocerebral silence occurs at a mean temperature of 18 °C. The achievement of measured electrocerebral silence has been called \\"a safe and reliable guide\\" for determining cooling required for individual patients, and verification of electrocerebral silence is required prior to stopping blood circulation to begin a DHCA procedure. Secondary to conservation of local energy resources by metabolic slowing and brain inactivation, hypothermia also protects the brain from injury by other mechanisms during stopped blood circulation. These include reduction of free radicals and immune-inflammatory processes. Temperatures used Mild hypothermia (32 °C to 34 °C) and moderate hypothermia (26 °C to 31 °C) are contraindicated for hypothermic circulatory arrest because 100% and 75% of people respectively will not achieve electrocerebral silence in these temperature ranges. Consequently, safe circulatory arrest times for mild and moderate hypothermia are only 10 and 20 minutes respectively. While moderate hypothermia may be satisfactory for short surgeries, deep hypothermia (20 °C to 25 °C) affords protection for times of 30 to 40 minutes at the bottom of this temperature range. Profound hypothermia (< 14 °C) usually isn't used clinically. It is a subject of research in animals and human clinical trials. As of 2012, the lowest body temperature ever survived by a human being was 9 °C (48 °F) as part of a hypothermic circulatory arrest experiment to treat cancer in 1957. This temperature was reached without surgery, using external cooling alone. Similar low temperatures are expected to be reached in emergency preservation and resuscitation (EPR) clinical trials described in the Research section of this article.  Cooling techniques  Since the benefits of hypothermia were discovered there have been numerous methods used to cool the body to desired temperatures. Hippocrates used snow and ice to surface cool wounded patients to prevent excessive bleeding. This method would fall under conventional cooling techniques, in which cold saline and crushed ice are used to induce a state of hypothermia to the patient. These techniques are inexpensive but lack the precision needed to maintain target temperatures and require careful monitoring. It has been proven to help prevent undesirable rewarming of the brain during DCHA. Hospitals and emergency medical services commonly use surface cooling systems that circulate cold air or water around blankets or pads. Advantages of this method are accuracy of cooling due to auto-regulating temperature control, feedback probes, applicable in non-hospital settings, and non-complexity of use. Drawbacks to surface cooling systems is skin irritation, shivering and rate of cooling. Intravascular cooling systems regulate temperature from inside veins such as the femoral, sub-clavian, or internal jugular to reduce adverse effects that external cooling methods cause. This method is unparalleled in achieving and maintaining the target temperature desired. The use of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has proven effective in the induction of hypothermia as an intravascular cooling system. Method People who are to undergo DHCA surgery are placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), a procedure that uses an external heart-lung machine that can artificially replace the function of the heart and lungs. A portion of the circulating blood supply is removed and stored for later replacement, with the remaining blood diluted by added fluids with the objective of reducing viscosity and clotting tendencies at cold temperature. The remaining diluted blood is cooled by the heart-lung machine until hypothermia causes the heart to stop beating normally, after which the blood pump of the heart-lung machine continues blood circulation through the body. Corticosteroids are typically given 6–8 hours before surgery as it has shown to have neuroprotective properties to decrease risk of neurological dysfunction by decreasing the release of inflammatory cytokines. Glucose is eliminated from all intravenous solutions to reduce the risk of hyperglycemia. In order for accurate hemodynamic monitoring, arterial monitoring is typically placed in the femoral or radial artery. Temperature is taken from two separate sites, typically the bladder and nasopharynx, is used to estimate brain and body temperatures. Cardioplegic drugs may be administered to ensure the heart stops beating completely (asystole), which is protective of both the heart and brain when circulation is later stopped. Cooling continues until the brain is inactivated by the cold, and electrocerebral silence (flatline EEG) is attained. The blood pump is then switched off, and the interval of circulatory arrest begins. At this time more blood is drained to reduce residual blood pressure if surgery on a cerebral aneurysm is to be performed to help create a bloodless surgical field. After surgery is completed during the period of cold circulatory arrest, these steps are reversed. The brain and heart naturally resume activity as warming proceeds. The first activity of the warming heart is sometimes ventricular fibrillation requiring cardioversion to re-establish a normal beating rhythm. Except for the period of complete inactivation just prior to and during the circulatory arrest interval, barbiturate infusion is used to keep the brain in a state of burst suppression for the entirety of the DHCA procedure until emergence from anesthesia. Hypothermic perfusion is maintained for 10–20 minutes while on CPB before rewarming as to reduce the risk of increased intracranial pressure. Warming must be done carefully to avoid overshooting normal body temperature. It is recommended that rewarming is stopped once the body is warmed to 37 °C. Post-operative hyperthermia is associated with adverse outcomes. Patients are completely rewarmed before discontinuing CPB, but temperature remain labile despite rewarming efforts which requires close monitoring in the ICU.  Complications  The use of hypothermia following cardiac arrest shows increased likelihood of survival. It is the re-warming period that, if not controlled properly, can have detrimental effects. Hyperthermia during the re-warming period shows unfavorable neurologic outcomes. For each degree the body is warmed above 37 °C, there is an increased association with severe disability, coma, or vegetative states. Excessive rewarming with temperatures above 37 °C can increase the risk of cerebral ischemia secondary to the increased oxygen demand that occurs with rapid rewarming. Several theories have been proposed, with one being during re-warming, the body releases increasing catecholamines which increase heat production leading to a loss of thermoregulation. Hyperthermia in the preperfusion period can also be caused by an increase in the production of oxygen radicals, which influences brain metabolism. These oxygen radicals attack cell membranes, leading to a disruption of intracellular organelles and subsequent cellular death. Virtually all patients who undergo DHCA develop impaired glucose metabolism and require insulin to control blood sugars. Thrombocytopenia and clotting factor deficiencies prove to be a significant cause of early death after DHCA. Careful monitoring intra- procedure and post-procedure is needed. Although DHCA is necessary for some procedures, the use of anesthesia can provide optimum operation time and organ protection but can also have serious impacts on cellular demand, brain cells, and serious systemic inflammatory results. Possible disadvantages of DHCA includes alteration in organ functions of the liver, kidney, brain, pancreas, intestines and smooth muscles due to cellular damage. Permanent neurological injury has been seen in 3-12% of patients when using DHCA. Cases of partial or complete limb motor loss, impaired language, visual defects, and cognitive decline have all been reported as consequences of DHCA. Other neurological complications are increase risk for seizures postoperative due to delayed return of cellular blood flow to the brain. When compared to Moderate Hypothermia (temperature dropped to 26-31 °C), there was less bleeding volume experienced during surgery thus leading to less use of packed red blood cells or plasma post surgery. Longer recovery time postoperatively have been noted with DHCA as compared to Moderate Hypothermia, but the length of hospital stay and death has no correlated difference. Most patients can tolerate 30 minutes of DHCA without significant neurological dysfunction or adverse effects, but after an extended period of 40 minutes or more, prevalence of increase brain injury have been noted. Research One of the anticipated medical uses of long circulatory arrest times, or so-called clinical suspended animation, is treatment of traumatic injury. In 1984 CPR pioneer Peter Safar and U.S. Army surgeon Ronald Bellamy proposed suspended animation by hypothermic circulatory arrest as a way of saving people who had exsanguinated from traumatic injuries to the trunk of the body. Exsanguination is blood loss severe enough to cause death. Until the 1980s, it had been thought impossible to resuscitate victims whose heart stopped because of blood loss, resulting in these victims being declared dead when cardiac resuscitation failed. Traditional treatments such as CPR and fluid replacement or blood transfusion are not effective when cardiac arrest has already occurred and bleeding remains uncontrolled. Safar and Bellamy proposed flushing cold solution through blood vessels of victims of deadly bleeding, and leaving them in a state of cold circulatory arrest with the heart stopped until the cause of bleeding could be surgically repaired to allow later resuscitation. In preclinical studies at the University of Pittsburgh during the 1990s, the process was called deep hypothermia for preservation and resuscitation, and then suspended animation for delayed resuscitation. The process of cooling victims of fatal bleeding for surgical repair and later resuscitation was finally called Emergency Preservation and Resuscitation for Cardiac Arrest from Trauma (EPR-CAT), or EPR. It is presently undergoing human clinical trials. In the trials, victims who suffer clinical death of less than five minutes duration from blood loss are being cooled from normal body temperature of 37 °C to less than 10 °C by pumping a large quantity of ice-cold saline into the largest blood vessel of the body (aorta). By remaining in circulatory arrest at temperatures below , it is believed that surgeons have one to two hours to fix injuries before circulation must be restarted. Surgeons involved with this research have said that EPR changes the definition of death for victims of this type of trauma.

It was a development of the Supermarine Swan, which was used for a ten-passenger service between England and France. Design and development The Southampton was designed by the team of R. J. Mitchell, better known as the designer of the later Spitfire. Due to the success of the Swan, the Air Ministry ordered six Southamptons direct from the drawing board, which was unusual. As the Swan had acted in effect as a prototype, development time was short. The Southampton was a twin-engine biplane flying boat, with the tractor engines mounted between the wings. The Southampton Mk I had both its hull and its wings manufactured from wood. The Southampton Mk II had a hull with a single thickness of metal (duralumin) (the Mk I had a double wooden bottom). This change gave an effective weight saving of (of this 900 lb, represented the lighter hull, while the remaining represented the weight of water that could be soaked up by the wooden hull) allowing for an increase in range of approximately .Andrews and Morgan 1987, p. 100. In 1929, 24 of the Mk I were converted by having newly built metal hulls replacing the wooden ones. Some of the later aircraft were built with metal wings and were probably designated as Southampton Mk III. There were three positions for machine guns, one in the nose and two staggered in the rear fuselage. The first flight of a production aircraft was made on 10 March 1925, and delivery to the RAF started in mid-1925. Operational history Southamptons first entered RAF service in August 1925 with No. 480 (Coastal Reconnaissance) Flight at RAF Calshot. In a series of \\"showing the flag\\" flights, the type quickly became famous for long- distance formation flights; the most notable was a expedition in 1927 and 1928. It was carried out by four Southamptons of the Far East Flight, setting out from Felixstowe via the Mediterranean and India to Singapore. Further Southamptons were sold to a number of other countries. Eight new aircraft were sold to Argentina, with Turkey purchasing six aircraft and Australia buying two ex-RAF Mk 1 aircraft. Japan also purchased a single aircraft which was later converted into an 18-passenger cabin airliner. One RAF aircraft was loaned to Imperial Airways, with British Civil Registration G-AASH, for three months from December 1929 to replace a crashed Short Calcutta on the airmail run between Genoa and Alexandria. In all, 83 Southamptons were constructed, excluding the three-engined Southampton MK X which was a single prototype.Andrews and Morgan 1987, p. 358.

Although the story is widely reported, these deaths did not occur. Lake Michigan was the source of Chicago's drinking water. During a tremendous storm in 1885, the rainfall washed refuse from the Chicago River far out into the lake and locals feared the sewage would reach the city's water intake cribs, two miles offshore. According to the legend, typhoid, cholera and other waterborne diseases from the contaminated drinking water killed up to 90,000 people. The Chicago Sanitary District (now The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District) was said to have been created by the Illinois legislature in 1889 in response to a terrible epidemic which killed thousands of residents of this fledgling city. However, analysis of the deaths in Chicago shows no deaths from cholera and only a slight rise in typhoid deaths. In fact, no cholera outbreaks had occurred in Chicago since the 1860s. Typhoid deaths never exceeded 1,000 in any year in the 1880s. The supposed 90,000 deaths would have represented 12% of the city's entire populationReversal of the Chicago River, The Traveling Cableway and Some Other Devices Employed by Contractors on the Chicago Main Drainage Canal.

Libby Hill, researching her book The Chicago River: A Natural and Unnatural History, found no newspaper or mortality records and, at her prompting, the Chicago Tribune issued a retraction (on September 29, 2005) of the three recent instances where they had mentioned the epidemic.*  Actual deaths  An outbreak of cholera in 1849 killed 678 persons, 2.9 percent of the city's population, and an 1854 outbreak killed 1,424 people. Another cholera epidemic hit the city in 1866 and 1867.Chicago Public Library (Web Archive) In the late 19th century, typhoid fever mortality rate in Chicago averaged 65 per 100,000 people a year. The worst year was 1891, when the typhoid death rate was 174 per 100,000 persons. One of the most famous people to die from typhoid fever in Chicago was Stephen A. Douglas, a Democratic contender in the 1860 presidential election, who died on June 3, 1861. In stark contradiction to this was the 1893 census not undertaking the residence of 25 million visitors to the Chicago Columbian Exhibition, pushing the total deaths much higher than the mythological 90,000.

It is the southernmost boreal bog east of the Mississippi River, containing many black spruce and tamarack trees at the southern limit of their ranges. Technically, it can be classed as an acid fen, as it receives some groundwater flow. The site was designated a National Natural Landmark in December 1974. It was purchased by The Nature Conservancy and the Conservation and Research Foundation in 1957. Like many bogs, its terrain presents an image of solidity, but a liquid mass of decaying peat lies beneath a six-inch (152 mm) layer of sphagnum and a network of supporting tree roots. However, this bog may be viewed from a floating walkway. History Cranberry Creek The bog began as a \\"kettle lake\\" formed approximately 10,000 years ago by a portion of the retreating Wisconsin Glacier (named according to geologic epoch, not location), which initially covered a depth up to the top of the current forest canopy. With restricted air and nutrient flow, sphagnum moss grew out into the lake, eventually forming a layer of peat over thick. While young bogs may contain an \\"eye\\" of open water where sphagnum has not yet reached, no such feature remains in the Tannersville Cranberry Bog. However, a narrow strip of open water marks the course of the Cranberry Creek, where the water is less acidic.

Niering, who as a child visited the bog as the nephew of its owner and was moved ultimately to become a widely recognized authority on bog ecology. The practical benefits of the bog were evident during the Flood of 1955, when bridges downstream of the bog were spared from the massive damage done in much of the Poconos. In 1956 The Nature Conservancy acquired the first for protection. The area held by this organization has increased by gifts and purchases to over , and adjoins on additional public lands. Public visitation Initially, public visitation to the land was not permitted. However, in the 1980s the Monroe County Conservation District negotiated access to the bog for purposes of public education. A floating boardwalk was constructed and expanded to in 1993, which consists of treated lumber supported by floating barrels. Planks are now replaced as needed with a recycled plastic product.

It is found in Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay. Description The long-tailed spiny rat is a large rat with a head-and-body length of between and a tail length of . The fur is less bristly than in other related species. The upper parts are a glossy chestnut colour becoming more orange on the flanks. The underparts are white, and there is a clear line separating upper and lower parts. The tail is chestnut above and pale below. The tails are missing on some individuals, reflecting the lizard-like ability of many echimyids to detach their tails when attacked by predators. Distribution and habitat This species has a range in South America extending from southern Bolivia and northern Paraguay to western and central Brazil. It is terrestrial and inhabits dry primary and secondary forest, as well as cerrado and habitats with cleared areas and patches of forest. It usually occurs at altitudes below but has been recorded up to about . Ecology A study was undertaken in Bolivia to establish which small rodents were reservoir hosts for Leishmania, the causal agent for the human disease leishmaniasis. It was found that Oryzomys nitida and Oryzomys acritus were often implicated but that P. longicaudatus did not harbour the infection. Phylogeny Morphological characters and mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA sequences showed that P. longicaudatus belongs to the so-called longicaudatus group of Proechimys species, and shares closer phylogenetic affinities with the other members of this clade: P. brevicauda and P. cuvieri. Status The long-tailed spiny rat is a common and adaptable species, being able to tolerate some degree of habitat modification. The dry forests in this part of South America are being cleared for agricultural purposes and it is thought the population trend of this rat is downwards. However, it has a wide range, and a presumed large total population, and the rate of decline is slow, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

The 21-year-old rookie began the season with the Hopkinsville Hoppers of the KITTY League. The Louisville, Kentucky native dominated the Class D circuit, leading the league with a .385 batting average, 161 hits and 101 runs scored. Impressed, the Giants (who had already clinched the National League pennant) brought Higbee to New York, and the kid did not disappoint, with a .400 average (4-for-10), five runs batted in and two runs scored. (Higbee's 5 RBI is the most for any MLB player who appeared in three games or fewer.) All three of Higbee's games were played at the Polo Grounds, and all were Giant victories. Higbee also socked an inside-the-park home run in what would be his final major league at bat. In the field, he played left field and right field, with two putouts and no errors. Higbee did not play in the 1922 World Series (a victory for the Giants over the New York Yankees), and was returned to the minors. Higbee did not play at all in 1923, then spent two seasons with the Portsmouth Truckers of the Class B Virginia League, batting .273 in 153 games. After another break in 1926, Higbee returned to pro ball in 1927 with the Evansville Hubs of the Three-I League, retiring after hitting just .188 in sixteen games. Higbee died at the age of 66 in Depauw, Indiana.

Description Like other members of the genus Thrichomys, but unlike all other species of spiny rat, common punarés have no spines, and instead have a thick pelt of soft fur, which also extends for the full length of the tail. The fur is greyish-brown over most of the body, with whitish underparts and ears. There are also three pairs of small white spots on the face; one each above and below the eyes, and one at the base of the ears. They are the size of a large rat, measuring in length, not counting the tail. On average, they weigh , although males are slightly larger than females. Females have four teats, with one pair just behind the forelegs, and another in front of the hips. Distribution and habitat The common punaré is found only in eastern Brazil, where it inhabits a belt of relatively open caatinga and cerrado vegetation between the Amazonian and Atlantic Forests. It is found from the coasts of Ceará and Rio Grande do Norte through all of the other states of the Northeast Region, and across much of Minas Gerais in the south. Within this region, it inhabits mainly dry and rocky habitats. Although it was formerly thought that there were as many as five subspecies, some of these are now regarded as entirely separate species, and only two subspecies are still recognised: * Thrichomys apereoides apereoides - southern part of range * Thrichomys apereoides laurenteus - northern part of range Behaviour and biology Common punarés are active mainly around dawn, resting for the rest of the day in nests among rocky boulders, or taking temporary refuge in any available crevice. They inhabit home ranges of , defending them from rivals using a combination of erect and semi-erect threat displays, kicking, wrestling, and chasing. They are agile animals, easily able to clamber through rugged and rocky terrain, and are also able to climb trees. They are herbivorous, and able to survive without drinking for at least eighteen days under laboratory conditions. In the wild, they can obtain additional water by eating prickly pear cactuses. They breed throughout the year, giving birth to a litter of, on average, three pups, after a gestation of about 97 days. The young weigh about at birth, and are born with open eyes and a full coat of fur. They begin to eat solid food within a few hours of birth, but are not fully weaned until about 28 days of age.

History Craig Key was originally named Camp Panama, and was not a natural island, but a wide spot on the Overseas Railroad right-of-way. It was originally a vacation spot and flag stop on the railroad. Roland W. Craig leased the island from the railroad in the early 1930s, and by 1935 the island had been named Craig, Florida. Former president Herbert Hoover sailed his yacht out of Craig at times in the 1930s. The island's greatest claim to fame, however, is being the landfall site of the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane. Captain Ivar Olsen, who had been taking refuge from the storm in his dry-docked boat near the island, recorded a barometer measurement of , the lowest sea-level atmospheric pressure ever recorded on land. The town was a total loss, but was rebuilt, and prospered as a vacation spot after the storm. Originally a single island, two more man-made Keys were added, one to the southwest in 1955, and one to the northeast some time later.

Yakov Saulovich Agranov () (born Yankel Samuilovich Sorenson; 1893 - 1938) was the first chief of Soviet Main Directorate of State Security and a deputy of NKVD chief Genrikh Yagoda. He is known as one of main organizers of Soviet political repressions and Stalinist show trials in 1920s and 1930s. He fabricated the \\"Tagantsev conspiracy\\" case and Moscow trials, including Trial of the Twenty One and Industrial Party Trial, as well as mass arrests and executions in Saint Petersburg during Stalin's Great Purge. Biography Agranov was born in a Jewish shopkeeper's family in Checherskaya, a village in the Mogilev Governorate of the Russian Empire. In 1912 he joined the Socialist-Revolutionary Party while working as a clerk and in 1915 joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. He was arrested by the tsarist police in 1915 and exiled to Yenesei province. In 1918, Agranov became secretary of Sovnarkom. At this time he was taking orders directly from Vladimir Lenin and Felix Dzerzhinsky. During this period Agranov was put in charge of compiling the lists of intellectuals for the forced exile of leading figures of Russian sciences and culture that were seen as the anti- Soviet element. Among those expelled were Nikolai Berdyaev and Nikolai Lossky. In 1921, Agranov was the chief investigator who conducted the \\"Petrograd military organization\\", allegedly headed by Vladimir Tagantsev. Tagantsev was arrested and then tricked into giving names 300 \\"conspirators\\", who, he was told, would not be executed. in exchange for leniency for himself. The investigation ended with more than 85 persons being sentenced to death, including Tagantsev himself and the poet Nikolay Gumilyov. All concerned were promptly executed. When asked why he was so merciless, Agranov responded: \\"Seventy percent of Petrograd intellectuals were standing by one leg in the camp of our enemies. We had to burn that leg off\\".Vitaliy Shentalinsky, Crime Without Punishment, Progress-Pleyada, Moscow, 2007, (Russian: Виталий Шенталинский, \\"Преступление без наказания\\"), page 214. Agranov also investigated the Kronstadt rebellion and the peasant uprising in Tambov region. At the end of his career he led the Trial of the Twenty One against the Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization, the “Promparty” and \\"Working Peasant Party \\" cases. Agranov was also implicated in the suspicious suicide of Vladimir Mayakovsky in 1930. The poet shot himself from the gun given to him as a gift by Agranov who had an affair with Lilya Brik, a woman known as the muse of Mayakovsky.Vitaly Shentalinsky, page 241; Nikolay Punin, husband of Anna Akhmatova, also had an affair with Lilya Brik, according to his published diaries Immediately after the assassination of Sergey Kirov in Leningrad on 1 December 1934, Agranov was entrusted with the organization of mass reprisals in the city. Stalin ordered him to fabricate a story that Lev Kamenev, Grigory Zinoviev and other leaders of the opposition were responsible for the murder, but seems to have resisted, whereupon Stalin entrusted Nikolai Yezhov to do it instead. In 1935, he was ordered by Yezhov to track down and liquidate \\"an undiscovered centre of Trotskyists\\" in Moscow, as a preparatory step for the great purge that Stalin was planning. When Yezhov took over as head of the NKVD, Agranov remained his First Deputy, and in December 1936 was appointed Head of the Chief Directorate of State Security, which seemingly meant that he was to be trusted to purge the NKVD of officers Yezhov did not trust. In February 1937, he circulated regional NKVD heads demanding names of Trotskyists and other oppositionists employed with the state security apparatus. In April, he was demoted to the post of regional NKVD chief in Saratov. He was arrested on 20 July 1937, and appeared on the execution list of 1 November 1937, in which his name was crossed out. He was executed by firing squad as an \\"enemy of the people\\" on 1 August 1938.Nikita Petrov and Marc Jansen, Stalin’s Loyal Executioner: People’s Commissar Nikolai Ezhov 1895–1940, 4 April 2002, , page 62 (chapter 3), available online at: http://www.hoover.org/publications/books/8348.

Barney's frustration is made worse by being a fan of the Philadelphia Eagles, who are mired in a slump. Due to a sticky lever on his garbage truck, Barney has (without realizing it) developed a very strong kick. One day at the city dump, Barney kicks a water jug extremely far and catches the attention of a group of Eagles executives, who are scouting the location for land to build a new stadium. The Eagles coach offers Barney a job as the team's new kicker, which the owner feels is an excellent publicity stunt in \\"giving an average Joe a shot at the NFL\\". Barney joins the Eagles, but at first isn't really accepted by his teammates, especially his roommate, Bubba. But once Barney starts playing and makes a lot of important field goals, his teammates and football fans all over town begin to love him, giving him the nickname \\"G-Man\\". Unfortunately, the fame and popularity begin to go to Barney's head, and he becomes conceited and talks down to his teammates. In the next game, Barney misses a potential game-winning field goal, knocking the Eagles out of contention for the playoffs. Barney goes to a bar, depressed and lonely, when an attractive blonde woman approaches him. She asks him if he is Barney Gorman and if she could take a picture with him. Barney is caught off guard when the woman kisses him as the photo is being taken. She says thanks while giving him an alluring smile as she walks away. Barney's mood goes from bad to worse and he is suspended from the team. He misses a date with his wife (Jessica Tuck), who then sees the picture of him kissing the blonde woman in the newspaper. When Barney arrives at home, he finds that his wife has kicked him out as well, leaving his suitcase outside the door with the photo from the newspaper. After some soul-searching, Barney comes to his senses and apologizes to his wife, son, father, and his teammates. The Eagles let him back on the team, just in time for the final game of the season. Barney is given a chance to redeem himself as the game again comes down to a last-second field goal. The holder fumbles the snap, and Barney grabs it and scores the game-winning touchdown. At the end-of-season press conference, Barney remembers his roots as a garbageman and points out that garbagemen are deserving of respect, too, as they work hard to keep the city clean.Variety Cast {  width=\\"50%\\" - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" !

He was an original member of a team of reporters and war correspondents known as the Murrow Boys.  Early career  Grandin was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He graduated from Yale University in 1930 and studied international law at the University of Berlin and the École des sciences politiques in Paris. In Paris, Grandin worked at the International Chamber of Commerce.  Journalist  In 1939 Grandin became the second reporter hired by Edward R. Murrow and one of the original Murrow Boys. Murrow hired Grandin, who had no journalism experience, mostly for Grandin's language skills and his expertise in international issues. Grandin began covering Paris for Murrow and CBS but abruptly left Europe in 1940. Paris fell to the German onslaught in 1940, and Grandin decided that he had to return to the United States. His reasons were personal. Initially, Grandin intended to send only his wife back to the US, but because she was Romainian and lacked an American passport, she would not have been allowed into the country without him. Murrow understood Grandin's reasoning, but others at CBS, including William Shirer, saw Grandin as a deserter. In 1944, Grandin took a job with ABC News in covering the war. In June of that year he accompanied the first American troops to land at Omaha Beach in Normandy on D-Day. Grandin retired from broadcasting after the war and went to work as a sales executive.

While with the Pistons, he was named to the 1960 and 1961 NBA All-Star West Teams. Dukes averaged double figures in rebounds in six of his eight seasons in the NBA, and had career averages of 11.3 rebounds per game and 10.4 points per game. Dukes led the NBA in personal fouls in 1958 (311) and 1959 (332) and led the NBA in disqualifications four consecutive seasons between 1958–59 and 1961–62 -- still an NBA record. His 121 career disqualifications (in only eight seasons) rank second in the NBA to Vern Mikkelsen, and he holds the record for the highest career percentage of games fouled out (21.9%) for any player with over 400 games played. On March 14, 2001, Dukes was found dead in his apartment in Detroit, Michigan. According to a police spokesman, he had been dead for about a month when his body was found.

Taxonomy Recently published studies suggest that the taxonomy of the genus Trinomys as currently described is not yet stable and that the genus might well be split. Some evidence suggests that the lineage of the South American spiny rats is older than might have been expected and in spite of morphological resemblance, the populations have diverged widely.Lara, M.C., Patton, J.L., 2000. Evolutionary diversification of spiny rats (genus Trinomys, Rodentia: Echimyidae) in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 130, 661–686. Status In 2008 the IUCN Red List rated Trinomys gratiosus as Least Concern (LC); its population is apparently large, it does not seem to be declining fast enough for listing in a threatened category, and the habitat is not under obvious threat. Common name The species does not occur and is not widely known in Anglophone regions, so the idea of popular English names raises problems. For example, at least two coined \\"common names\\" have been published recently without special authority. Neither is in use in the local vernacular where the species is endemic, and neither is a valid derivation of the species name. \\"Gracile Atlantic spiny-rat\\" is inappropriate because the word gracile has nothing to do with the meaning or etymology of the Latin \\"gratiosus\\". A rival name, \\"graceful spiny-rat\\", is no better justified; \\"gratiosus\\" specifically means either \\"enjoying favour, favoured, beloved\\", or \\"showing favour, complaisant\\" \\"a favourite\\", or at best \\"gracious\\", not \\"graceful\\".Morell, Thomas; \\"An Abridgement of Ainsworth's Latin Dictionary\\" 13th ed, John Carey; Pub Longman, London, 1834. No authority to date has proposed a better option than using the species name, Trinomys gratiosus in English.

He was capped by Worcestershire in 1966 and by Gloucestershire in 1977.Playfair Cricket Annual, 1981 edition, p76. Brain was educated at the King's School, Worcester. After turning in some good performances in the Worcestershire second team, Brain was selected to make his first-class debut against Oxford University in late June 1959. He took five wickets in the match (his first being that of Oxford captain Alan Smith), but played only one further first-class game that season, against Somerset in the County Championship. He took 4–53 in the first innings, but was not to make another first-team appearance for almost five years. After some more eye- catching figures in the second team (7–29 against Nottinghamshire II; 8–79 against Kent II) in 1964, Brain finally played first-class cricket again, facing Cambridge University at Halesowen. He took only one wicket, but was retained for the Championship game which followed (coincidentally this was also against Somerset), and in this match he excelled, taking 6–93 and 4–73 as Worcestershire won by 122 runs. Although he dropped out of the side thereafter, he returned as a regular from mid-August to the end of the season, finishing with 31 wickets at 24.19. He went on Worcestershire's tour of Rhodesia in 1964–65, one of only two occasions on which Brain played overseas (the other being the county's tour of West Indies the following winter). He played in one of the two first-class games against the Rhodesians, then back in England for the 1965 season he appeared 12 times, taking five or more wickets in an innings three times to finish with 44 first-class victims. In that season he also played his first List A cricket, against Sussex in the Gillette Cup: his first two victims in one-day cricket were Ted Dexter and Jim Parks. For most of the rest of the 1960s, Brain continued to play a dozen games a season or slightly more, as well as a handful of one-day matches, and to pick up around 40 wickets a year. In 1969, however, he played 19 times in first-class cricket and snared 73 wickets at just over 25 runs apiece; he also appeared 13 times in one-day cricket, albeit with considerably less success. In 1970 he played only seven first-class matches, then for the next two seasons he was entirely a one-day player, turning out 20 times in List A cricket but not at all in the longer form of the game. The 1973 season saw Brain make his return to first-class duties, and he immediately delivered, taking 84 wickets at 19.29 that year, a career best tally that he was to equal (at an average only slightly higher) the following summer. Those two seasons also saw him pick up 58 one-day wickets, while in the Championship he took 6–36 against Gloucestershire in July 1973. His form dipped a little in 1975, but he still took more than 50 first-class wickets, including a career-best 8–55 against Essex in late May; that performance was in vain, however, as a second-innings Worcestershire collapse saw them lose by 29 runs. For the 1976 season, Brain moved to Gloucestershire, and though he started relatively slowly with 41 first-class wickets in that first year, in the following seasons he claimed 77. He also scored his only first-class half-century, scoring 57 against Essex. This was a somewhat startling scorecard entry, as in his other eleven innings that season his highest score was just 6! The following summer he took 76 first-class wickets, managing his best bowling for his new county when he recorded 7–51 against the touring Australians in May. That season also saw him achieve his highest season's total of List A wickets: he dismissed 34 victims, at an outstanding bowling average of only 14.55. Now approaching forty years old, Brain's form began to tail off, although he was still good enough to take a total of 106 first-class and 46 List A wickets in the next two seasons, with 6–68 against Glamorgan in May 1980 a highlight of his later years. He took his last first-class wicket (John Barclay) against Sussex in July 1981, although he did play two further Championship games without reward. His final List A game was for Minor Counties against Leicestershire in the 1982 Benson and Hedges Cup; he picked up the wickets of ex-Test cricketers Chris Balderstone and Roger Tolchard.

She was honored as Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1935. Early life and education Annie Jean Macnamara was born on 1 April 1899 to John and Annie Macnamara in Beechworth, Victoria. Her family moved to Melbourne when she was seven and she attended Spring Road State School. She received a scholarship to study at the Presbyterian Ladies' College. She entered the University of Melbourne at age 17 and graduated M.B. and B.S. in 1922; other notable Australians who also graduated in her class included Kate Isabel Campbell, Lucy Meredith Bryce, Jean Littlejohn, and Frank Macfarlane Burnet. Career After graduating, she became a resident medical officer at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. In 1923, Macnamara became a resident doctor at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. Hospital authorities had at first been reluctant to employ her on the grounds that it had no toilet facilities for women doctors.Sherratt, T. No Standing Back: Dame Jean Macnamara, Australasian Science, 1993 During her time at the Children's Hospital, there was a polio outbreak. She and Burnet demonstrated that there was more than one strain of the virus, a fact that would be important in the later development of the Salk vaccine. Between 1925 and 1931 she was consultant and medical officer responsible to the Poliomyelitis Committee of Victoria, and between 1930 and 1931 was an honorary adviser on polio to official authorities in New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania.Ann G. Smith, Macnamara, Dame Annie Jean (1899–1968), Australian Dictionary of Biography, vol. 10, Melbourne University Press, 1986, pp. 345–347. In 1931, she received a Rockefeller Fellowship to travel to England and United States to study orthopaedics. When she returned to Australia in 1934 she married dermatologist Joseph Ivan Connor, and they had two daughters, Joan and Merran. She conducted a successful orthopaedic work, and for this contribution was created DBE in 1935. Although she was considered the foremost Australian authority on the treatment of poliomyelitis, she continued to recommend the use of convalescent serum and splinting to immobilise limbs long after these treatments were abandoned in America. In the 1930s, she encouraged the Australian government to trial the myxoma virus to combat the Australian rabbit plague. Although trials were initially unsuccessful, she lobbied that they be continued, and when the virus became epizootic in 1951, the mosquito vector spread the virus among wild rabbits, killing millions. Death and legacy Macnamara died at the age of 69 from cardiovascular disease in 1968. Seven other Australian medical scientists were commemorated in the issue of a set of four Australian stamps released in 1995. She appears on the 45 cent stamp with fellow University of Melbourne graduate, Frank Macfarlane Burnet. In 2018, the Australian Electoral Commission renamed the federal electoral division of Melbourne Ports to Macnamara in her honour. A suburb of Canberra was named Macnamara, Australian Capital Territory in commemoration of Jean Macnamara. Macnamara Place, in the Canberra suburb of Chisholm, is also named in her honour. On April 1st, 2020, Google honoured her 121st birthday with a Google Doodle.

He served as Chief of Staff of the Royal Thai Army, Commander of the Royal Thai Navy, Naval Minister, Army Minister, Defense Minister, Interior Minister, and as a Privy Counsellor to both King Vajiravudh and King Prajadhipok. Biography Prince Paribatra was the 33rd child (and 13th son) of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) by Queen Sukhumala Marasri. He joined his father for a journey to Europe in 1897, following which he entered the Prussian Cadet Corps to study at the Prussian Military academy at Groß- Lichterfelde. Following his return to Siam, his half brother King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) appointed him Commander of the Royal Thai Navy, Minister of Marine and Minister of the Army. During the reign of King Prajadhipok (Rama VII), he was appointed Minister of Interior and was made member of the Supreme Council of the State of Siam, responsible for state affairs. Prince Paribatra's considerable influence in the Siamese government was deemed as a threat by the Khana Ratsadon which organized the 1932 coup that ended the absolute monarchy in Siam. As a consequence, he was exiled from the kingdom to Bandung, Dutch East Indies, which was then under the Dutch administration. He died in 1944 while in exile, in Japanese-controlled Indonesia. His remains were repatriated by a Royal commission (a member of which was Prince Arjuna Suasti) in 1948. A half-brother to two Thai kings, Prince Paribatra fathered eight children by his royal wife, Mom Chao (HSH Princess) Prasongsom Paribatra (Chaiyan). Two were sons, but only one, Chumbhotbongs Paribatra, lived to adulthood. Prince Paribatra also had a son with a commoner wife, Mom Somphan Paribatra na Ayudhaya (Palakawong), Prince Sukhumabhinanda - father of Mom Ratchawong Sukhumbhand Paribatra, the former governor of Bangkok. Prince Paribatra's principal Bangkok residence until his forced exile in 1932 was the neo-baroque styled Bang Khun Prom Palace, constructed by architects Mario Tamagno and Karl Döhring. It later became the headquarters and subsequently museum of the Bank of Thailand. Ancestry See also * Siamese coup d'état of 1932 * Supreme Council of State of Siam References * Paul M.

Melopoeia Melopoeia or melopeia is when words are \\"charged\\" beyond their normal meaning with some musical property which further directs its meaning, inducing emotional correlations by sound and rhythm of the speech. Melopoeia can be \\"appreciated by a foreigner with a sensitive ear\\" but does not translate well, according to Pound. Phanopoeia Phanopoeia or phanopeia is defined as \\"a casting of images upon the visual imagination,\\" throwing the object (fixed or moving) on to the visual imagination. In the first publication of these three types, Pound refers to phanopoeia as \\"imagism.\\" Phanopoeia can be translated without much difficulty, according to Pound. Logopoeia Logopoeia or logopeia is defined by Pound as poetry that uses words for more than just their direct meaning, stimulating the visual imagination with phanopoeia and inducing emotional correlations with melopoeia. Pound was said to have coined the word from Greek roots in a 1918 review of the \\"Others\\" poetry anthology — he defined the term as \\"the dance of the intellect among words.\\" Elsewhere he changes intellect to intelligence. In the New York Herald Tribune of 20 January 1929, he gave a less opaque definition: poetry which \\"employs words not only for their direct meaning, but [...] takes count in a special way of habits of usage, of the context we expect to find with the word\\". Logopoeia is the most recent kind of poetry and does not translate well, according to Pound, though he also claimed it was abundant in the poetry of Sextus Propertius (c.50BC-15BC).Pound, Ezra. ABC of Reading. George Roudedge Limited, 1934. p. 38. The actual word \\"logopoeia\\" was not coined by Pound.

Ouran Academy is an elite upper school catering to the ultra-rich. Haruhi Fujioka is a middle-class scholarship student, a rarity at the school. While searching for a quiet place to study, she stumbles upon an unused music room which turns out to be the club room for the school's Host Club — a group of idle rich boys, possessing exceptional good-looks, who entertain female clients. After accidentally knocking over a priceless Renaissance vase that's worth far more than Haruhi can possibly repay (¥8 million), she is forced to join the Host Club as an \\"errand boy\\" to work off her debt. Soon after, however, Haruhi proves to be a natural host (no training needed) and is promoted to full status as a Host of the Ouran Host Club. It then becomes clear that something isn't quite as it seems. The Ouran High School Host Club characters have been praised as well-rounded comedic creations that \\"play on bishōnen stereotypes\\", a theme commonly found in other Japanese manga. Name romanizations differ among the several different English- language products released for this franchise: English-language editions of the manga published by VIZ Media and Chuang Yi, the anime from Funimation and the Nippon Television's Japanese-language website on the series. Background The plot centers on the adventures of Haruhi Fujioka, a student of middle class means who earns entrance to Ouran Academy, an exclusive and prestigious high school attended by pupils from aristocratic or wealthy families. Haruhi is mistaken to be a boy due to her androgynous name, baggy clothing and cropped hair. In her search for a quiet place to study, she enters the Third Music Room where she encounters the members of the student- run host club where beautiful, charismatic male students entertain female students. In their initial encounter, she accidentally breaks a priceless Renaissance vase and is forced into servitude to the club in order to repay her debt. The Host Club itself is co-founded by Tamaki Suoh, son of the school's chairman, and his best friend, Kyoya Ootori, son of one of Japan's wealthiest and most elite families. Suoh hand picks the members with variety of appeal in mind for their potential customers. Each club member plays a specific role as a bishōnen stereotype: Tamaki Suoh is the princely type; Kyoya is the cool type; Mori is the strong silent type; Honey is the cute type; Hikaru and Kaoru are the little devil type; and Haruhi is the natural type (once promoted to hosthood). In addition to the club members, the storyline features customers and associates, as well as family members, schoolmates, rivals and other characters that come and go. Host Club members Anime screenshot featuring the Host Club members dressed as caterers. From left to right: \\"Mori\\", \\"Honey\\", Haruhi, Kaoru and Hikaru, Tamaki and Kyoya Ootori. Haruhi Fujioka Upon discovering gender, Tamaki insists that they keep it their secret which becomes the basis of the gender- bender humor throughout the series. Haruhi, herself, is portrayed as a female who firmly believes outward trappings, such as wealth or beauty, are secondary in importance to a person's inner qualities. She is not particularly invested in protecting her gender secret, and her cross-dressing as a boy is largely pragmatic, due to her inability to afford the $3,000 school uniform herself and need to act as a Host to pay off her debt. It is mainly the male Hosts who panic that Haruhi's gender will be exposed, leading them to engage in ridiculous schemes to avoid this, which would result in Haruhi having to leave the club and attracting the attention of other males. She is fairly oblivious to physical or sexual attention in general. For example, she is entirely unfazed when the twins lick cookie crumbs off her face to rile Tamaki. Haruhi is dedicated to her studies and aspires to enter law school to emulate her deceased mother. Her father has a temperament similar to Tamaki's and works as a host/bartender in a cross-dressing club to support their middle-class lifestyle, which contributes to her lax attitude towards gender. She is practical and honest to a fault but also caring and insightful. Haruhi dislikes needless extravagance, often finding the antics of the Host Club annoying, and has a distaste for the artificial. While not above manipulating them for her own reasons, she appreciates the boys' protectiveness and their genuine desire to \\"make every girl happy.\\" The series shows how Haruhi interacts with each of them in different ways and how her relationships with them evolve over time. Haruhi tends to be apathetic towards events, preferring to remain at a distance and observing until she needs to act. She is astute in gauging other people's motives and her ability to see people's true intentions through their artifice is the main reason others are drawn to her. Haruhi dislikes sweets, but has a fondness for seafood. Her desire to try otoro, an extremely expensive, high grade of sushi tuna, is a recurring gag. The manga storyline goes far beyond the 26 episodes of the anime and shows the deepening relationship between Haruhi and Tamaki. There, Haruhi's determination to pursue her education is paramount and she initially denies her budding feelings for Tamaki. Through continued shared life events which include dissolution of the club due to the Suoh matriarch's orders, Tamaki's reunion with his mother and Haruhi going to the U.S. to study, the two become a couple. In the omake that follow the conclusion of the manga, Haruhi still cannot commit fully to the relationship because of their ages, but eventually, they marry, as seen in an omake set two years after the close of the manga. They are the first of the Host Club members to have children. Portrayed by: Haruna Kawaguchi Tamaki Suoh , whose full name is , is a second-year student at Ouran Academy, a co-founder and the president of the Host Club. His birth date is April 4 , and he is 16 years old at the beginning of the anime. Flamboyant and narcissistic, he is dedicated to his duties as a host. He is the princely type, entertaining customers with upper-class etiquette and shameless flattery. Tamaki is partial to classic piano music and plays exceedingly well. He refers to his club as his \\"family,\\" with himself as the father figure; Kyoya, the mother; Haruhi, the daughter; Hikaru and Kaoru, the brothers; and Mori and Honey, the uncles. Tamaki is the main comic relief character of the series. He is outspoken and naïve for his age, viewing himself as an obsessive father figure to Haruhi when he is really in love with her despite his flirtatious ways with the female students who visit Music Room 3. The other hosts clearly see Tamaki's oblivious nature when it comes to his feelings for the girl and although Tamaki is perceptive regarding the feelings of others, which Hikaru and Kaoru both note, he is dense about his own. He admires Haruhi's personality and doesn't understand his jealousy when other boys express interest in her. Whenever he is teased by Haruhi he tends to sit in a fetal position in a secluded corner or grow mushrooms in a dark closet. Tamaki is a hāfu (half-blooded Japanese), living under the custody of his father, the wealthy chairman of Ouran Elite Academy. He is separated from his ailing French mother because of a deal she made with Shizue, his cold-hearted paternal grandmother. He lives at the Suoh family's second mansion while his father stays at the main mansion with his grandmother. Eventually, he is accepted into the main residence where she makes his life sour by \\"pulling him back to reality.\\" Still, he manages to win her approval with his music and kindness, and the two grow close. Because of this, she eventually allows him to reunite briefly with his mother. At a certain point in the manga, Tamaki realizes that he loves Haruhi as a woman and not as a daughter, yet fails to act upon his feelings due to his own divided family, fearing that something similar will happen to the Host Club should he ever pursue Haruhi romantically. Thanks to his friends' efforts, however, he accepts that doing so will not hurt the club. Even then, he cannot find the courage to confess to her, frightened that she doesn't return his feelings. Then, upon hearing Haruhi's confession, he admits his feelings and the two become a couple. Towards the end of the manga, he surprises Haruhi by going with her to the United States. The two move into an apartment together, followed by the rest of the Host Club moving in next door, much to the couple's surprise. Manga omake show Tamaki contemplating marriage with Haruhi eight months after their move to Boston, which is realized two years later. He and Haruhi are the first of the Host Club members to have children. In addition, Tamaki is confirmed as the heir of the Suoh family, which requires him to travel abroad frequently, as stated when Haruhi mentions in passing during her conversation with Mei at Ouran University that she has not seen Tamaki for several weeks.

Portrayed by: Yusuke Yamamoto Kyoya Ootori is an attractive, calculating second-year student at Ouran Academy and vice-president of the Host Club. He was born on November 22 (Good Wife Day) and is 17 years old at the beginning of the series. and is the only host who wears corrective lenses. Kyoya is best friends with Tamaki, despite their completely different demeanors. Kyoya is secretive and highly intelligent, as his ability to calculate the financial and social benefits that result from the Host Club's adventures demonstrates. He is a realistic and pragmatic person, and officially acts as the club's accountant and manager. Unofficially, he is considered the \\"Shadow King,\\" running the club behind the scenes by influencing Tamaki and their guests. He is generally irritable and slow to wake up in the morning, which is attributed to low blood pressure. At club meetings, he always carries a variety of memo- keeping devices (e.g. a black notebook, a clipboard, a pocket-folio with tablet, or an era-appropriate book when in period costume) and keeps extensive dossiers on every student at the school. Kyoya is immediately aware that Haruhi is a girl upon her entrance to the third music room through such research. In everything he does, he gets something out of it. Yet, despite his occasionally antagonistic traits, such as his subtle threats, withholding information, and elegant revenge schemes for petty slights, the Host Club would not have been successful without Kyoya's resourcefulness and marketing. Although he is rarely seen entertaining guests of the Host Club, preferring to taking notes on meeting events, he has his admirers and is considered the cool \\"glasses\\" type. Kyoya lives with his father, a wealthy and powerful zaibatsu owner who specializes in hospital management. Originally, Kyoya is raised to remain in the defined role as the youngest child, meant to stay in his lane and support his older siblings and family name. Under Tamaki's influence, Kyoya breaks from this role and shows his genuine potential. Despite his detached exterior, Kyoya (like all the Hosts) is concerned about others, though it is often demonstrated in ways contrary and atypical. For example, when the Club goes to the beach and Haruhi confronts two thugs and is tossed into the sea, Kyoya later threatens Haruhi in an attempt to make her wary of confronting those larger and stronger than herself so the incident won't be repeated and she will be safe. Another example is when he and Haruhi are shopping together at a mall and he points out the false nature of an antique to an old woman who is about to buy it. Haruhi, like Tamaki, is able to see through his mask and thereafter, better understands his nature. Kyoya, unlike the rest of the Host Club, stays in the United States after their joint year in Boston. He is only mentioned in the July 2011 omake because of his university studies there and only makes a cameo appearance in the August 2011 omake. In Volume 18, Hatori declines to confirm whether he is named heir to the Ootori zaibatsu or not. As for his romantic future, she writes that he will marry a woman that brings merit to the Ootori family, although she doesn't discount the possibility that love would be involved in said choice. It is also mentioned that he owns a cat named Noel, which is very attached to him. It is further implied that his friendship with Tamaki fades a bit over time because of distance, though he stays in touch by periodically texting photos of Noel. Tamaki makes the effort to meet up with him when he is visiting the United States and the twins miss Kyoya to the point of convincing themselves that the lookalike ghost of an Ootori ancestor is actually Kyoya's \\"living ghost.\\" According to the author, if she had allotted forty pages for the first chapter of the manga instead of fifty, she would have cut Kyoya from the cast, but is glad this did not happen as \\"since the rest of the members are the way they are, he is invaluable for maintaining order and offering explanations.\\" Bisco named him after the fact he wears glasses by taking the last syllable of gankyō, meaning a pair of glasses.

Portrayed by: Shunsuke Daito Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin The twins, and , are depicted as mischievous, devious, and otherwise childish young men who toy with people, including their schoolmates. Their birth date is June 9, a date chosen by the manga artist to show that they are alike yet different, and they are 15 years old at the beginning of the series. When Hikaru and Kaoru are young, they are fond of a particular maid. One night, they discover her trying to steal from their mansion and offer her a deal. She must guess who is who in exchange for the combination to the family safe. When she can't win the game, they hide the slip of paper with the combination in their piggy bank. The maid, however, breaks their trust along with the bank, taking the combination and the family jewels while they're asleep. They awaken to find her escaping down a rope ladder along the side of the house and when they ask her why she broke her promise to them, she says it's because no one will ever be able to tell them apart. From that point on, they deceive others in varied ways and expect to be deceived in return. Before joining the Host club, Kaoru and Hikaru trust only one another, seeking no other friends. In the \\"Which one is Hikaru Game?\\" they admit that sometimes they want to be told apart and sometimes they don't. Their personalities have been shown to be quite different, Kaoru being the more sensible twin. During their second year of middle school, they meet Tamaki Suoh who invites them to join the newly formed Host Club. The twins agree to join only if Tamaki can guess which twin is which. Tamaki fails many times, but eventually guesses correctly, forcing the twins to join if only out of curiosity about this strange boy. The club opens them up to new experiences, including the development of a deep bond with Tamaki. Describing the world as \\"us\\" and \\"them,\\" the twins general distrust of others and the world, in general, is further dissolved when Haruhi joins the club and with her unique ability to tell the twins apart immediately and always, she helps them become more independent of each other and more trusting of others. The Hitachiin twins use an act of \\"forbidden brotherly love\\" as their main draw in the Host Club. They are both considered mischievous although they have their differences: Kaoru is nicer, more mature and considerate of others, while Hikaru is more immature though he is the older twin. Their different personalities are best shown when they are separated, and they also speak a little differently. Hikaru has a deeper voice and tends to speak first, while Kaoru has a higher voice and tends to speak second. There are several ways how to tell the twins apart: Hikaru's hair is parted to the left if you stand where he stands but right from your prospective side and Kaoru's hair parts to the right but looks like the left from your perspective ; Hikaru tends to stand on the right and Kaoru on the left. Both have a crush on Haruhi in the manga, and are quite protective of her. Kaoru confesses to Haruhi but soon adds that Hikaru is more important to him, putting his own feelings aside to support Hikaru's feelings for her. Hikaru's feelings for her are quite strong but he only realizes it later. In the anime, however, it was only implied that Hikaru had a crush on Haruhi. However, in the anime, Kaoru was the one who asked Haruhi out on a date, then faked a cold so Hikaru could go in his place so Hikaru and Haruhi could bond further. The twins live with their mother, Yuzuha, a fashion designer, and their considerably meek father, a computer software designer, until the final manga chapter in which they and the other Host Club members move to America to study with Haruhi. In the volume 18 extras, they are shown at college age with their younger sister, Ageha, who is born after the end of the series. She likes butterflies and flowers but has a personality much like her older brothers. She is attached to Tamaki, referring to him as \\"milord\\" or \\"boss,\\" just like Hikaru and Kaoru. The twins dote on her. The twins attend a college or university that is not Ouran University, since Ouran does not have a fine arts faculty. Hikaru voiced by: Kenichi Suzumura (Japanese anime and later drama CDs), Soichiro Hoshi (early drama CDs), Todd Haberkorn (English) Kaoru voiced by: Yoshinori Fujita (Japanese anime and later drama CDs), Kenichi Suzumura (early drama CDs), Greg Ayres (English) Portrayed by: Shinpei Takagi (Hikaru), Manpei Takagi (Kaoru) Mitsukuni \\"Honey\\" Haninozuka birth date is February 29 and a 3rd-year high school student. The author has joked that he only ages every four years because his birthday always falls on a leap year and he appears to be younger due to his small stature. Honey is depicted as a childish and a desserts-loving boy who is much older than his elementary school appearance indicates. He is also an expert martial artist from a famous martial arts family. When Haruhi is warned about his legendary skills, the point is illustrated in the anime by a mushroom cloud erupting where a city once stood. In the anime, there is a scene which shows Honey's true strength and it is said that Japan's Defense Minister has requested he never reveal his full potential, for fear that other nations might suspect that Japan holds a weapon of mass destruction, causing them to fire missiles upon that nation. Honey is often seen around his cousin Mori, with whom he is very close. He lives with his father, the owner of a famous dojo; and his little brother Yasuchika, with whom he is often at odds. Honey is very fond of sweets and stuffed animals. He always carries around his favorite plush bunny named Usa-chan, an abbreviation of usagi, which means rabbit (also called Bun-Bun in the manga). He once tried to hide his true nature by acting like a \\"real man,\\" but after Tamaki convinced him that true courage meant being exactly who you are, he stopped pretending. Together with Mori, he joined the Host Club, attracting customers with his shotacon cuteness. It's possible that his romanized nickname, Honey, is an adaptation of his first name, , as mitsu can mean . It could also be an abbreviation of his family name, Haninozuka. He is referred to almost exclusively by this nickname, Mori being the only one who fully calls him by his given name. He is also known as Hunny in the manga or Hani. He often refers to his kohais with the -chan honorific (e.g. \\"Haru-chan\\" and \\"Tama-chan\\"). In Chapter 72 of the manga, he graduates from Ouran, but says he will return to the Host Club every so often, as does Mori. They often return for visits and for a picnic planned by Haruhi. Mori and he also fetch Tamaki for the reunion plan with his mother. In Volume 18 of the manga, he is seen dating and marrying Reiko Kanazuki, and is the first of the Host Club members to marry. Their marriage is confirmed in the August 2011 omake, set two years after Chapter 83. In the July 2011 omake, it is confirmed that he is a third-year engineering student at Ouran University. Honey, like Kyoya, has a difficult time waking up. Despite his cute nature, he wakes up in the same manner as Kyoya, though he is much quicker when dealing with the person that wakes him up, as seen in the example of the U.S. platoon soldier who did so when the Haninozuka family visited America. He was originally intended to have an extreme dual personality; however, the \\"crouching in the corner, depressed\\" stance was reassigned from him to Tamaki. Portrayed by: Yudai Chiba Takashi \\"Mori\\" Morinozuka , usually called , is a third year student at Ouran Academy. His birth date is May 5, Children's/Boys' Day and he is 17 years old at the beginning of the series. The manga artist felt Children's Day to be a bit of a mismatch, but she later found Boys' Day to be quite fitting. Mori is depicted as tall, quiet and somewhat intimidating, but very protective of his cousin Honey, whom he fully calls by his first name, Mitsukuni. This is seen in the anime and manga when Honey has a toothache (anime: episode 12, manga: chapter 14). Mori blames himself for failing to remind Honey to brush his teeth after eating and restricts his cousin from eating sweets until he has a filling done. Honey judo-throws Mori to the floor in a fit of anger, but they soon make amends. It is learned that the Morinozuka family has protected and served the Haninozuka family for many generations but were joined by marriage two generations back, thus breaking the master-servant tradition. Nevertheless, Mori still faithfully protects Honey and is always by his side, attending to his wishes and watching out for him. His protective personality extends to his classmates and the Host Club members, earning him a high level of respect. He is also protective of Haruhi, as shown in episode 7, of whom he thinks in a very kind, brotherly way. As a host, he is considered the wild type (changed into the strong, silent type in the anime's English dub) and normally does not try to woo girls. The girls like how he cares for Honey and shyer customers are attracted to his tall physique and taciturn personality. In the manga, he has an outgoing little brother, Satoshi Morinozuka, who does not appear in the anime. Mori's hobbies include kendo, of which he is the national champion. In the manga, he becomes uncharacteristically talkative and flirtatious when tired. In the later chapters, he raises a chick who he names Piyo and takes in a stray tanuki, who he names Pome. He is also depicted as having a natural ability to tame animals, as shown in a few later chapters in which he easily tames two Doberman guard dogs at the Suoh residence and is able to summon a flock of doves in the amusement park. In chapter 72, he graduates from Ouran, deciding to study Theory and Philosophy of Law (or Jurisprudence). Although he is leaving for the university section, Honey and Mori state that they will visit the Host Club often. He continues to maintain a close relationship with the Host Club members even in the future, especially with Tamaki and Haruhi, being the first to congratulate them when they have children and visits often. The author states that despite having the quality of an old-fashioned, cool- looking Japanese man, Mori is very loving and devoted to his future wife and children. Portrayed by: Masaya Nakamura Supporting characters Host Club associates and customers  Renge Houshakuji  Anime screenshot depicting Renge. is the Host Club's self-proclaimed manager who tends to be incredibly loud and outspoken. She lives in France before attending Ouran and comes to the Host Club stating that she is Kyoya's fiancée despite never having met him in person. Her fascination with Kyoya originates from her obsession with a dating-sim game whose lead character, Ichigo Miyabi, resembles Kyoya. Tamaki initially hopes Renge will become a feminizing influence on Haruhi, but regrets his choice when Renge develops a crush on her, believing Haruhi to be a boy. Renge's expertise with dating sims makes her keenly aware of the tropes and conventions of shojou manga, which Tamaki eventually sees as useful to the Host Club; ergo, he makes her self- proclamation as their manager a genuine position. As such, Renge proves her worth on several occasions with her ability to predict what will win the greatest approval of the Host Club's customers based on her extensive knowledge on subjects connected to the concept of moe. Kyoya compliments her on several occasions and she is shown to be savvy in the area of media production and broadcasting. Renge is also shown to have talents outside of the Host Club: in the anime she is shown hosting a sentai show for school children and she is involved in producing the , a school magazine containing all things related to moe at Ouran Academy. Her catch phrase, \\"I could eat three bowls of rice\\", is a reference to the anime Green Green. In the manga Renge mostly disappears after her initial appearance in chapter 3, making only cameo appearances in subsequent chapters. Hatori mentioned that Renge was going to be a recurring character, but it never happened. Her comment probably led to Renge's numerous anime appearances in situations that originally included Tamaki in the manga, like the coaching of Shiro and Nekozawa. In volume 9, her appearances were significantly increased and she appears in the later chapters to help the club. In the July 2011 special chapter, she is seen as a first-year business student at Ouran University, speculating on Mei's and Kasanoda's possible romantic relationship in dramatic terms. A trait that Renge displays in both the anime and manga is that, when she becomes extremely angry, she assumes a Medusa-like look, with her hair transforming into snakes. At such times, she can drive most of the other characters before her to blind panic. Her primary running gag in the anime is her dramatic entrance, in which she rises from beneath the floor on a motorized rig (which has miraculously been installed wherever the host club happen to be), accompanied by dramatic music from \\"Swan Lake\\". She is presented as an undersocialized otaku.http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_3/darlington/ Portrayed by: Tao Tsuchiya Umehito Nekozawa is depicted as a hooded individual who holds a cat puppet named Belzeneff (also spelled Beelzenef or Bereznoff). Umehito has photophobia, which causes him to collapse and, according to him, die when under any kind of direct light; he tends to refer to anyone who drags him into lights as \\"murderers\\". As the Black Magic Club's President, he tries to get people to join his club, though not too successfully. Anyone who joins gets a free Belzeneff doll. Besides his own puppet, Umehito also has a wooden voodoo doll version of it. Nekozawa claims that if the name of a hated person is written on the back of the doll, that person will be showered with misfortunes. Tamaki, especially, is superstitious about Nekozawa's curses, having \\"experienced\\" them first-hand. In the anime, Umehito usually speaks to the host club through an ornate, candlelit black door, which seems to only be present when Umehito is. Umehito is very handsome under his hood. He has bright blue eyes and wears a black – dark green in the anime – wig over his naturally blond hair to keep his hair from exposure to the light. He has a child sister named Kirimi who is afraid of the dark and is under the impression that he is a monster due to his dark clothing. As a result, the two siblings are unable to be around one another until Tamaki and the Host Club get involved and prompt Umehito to adjust to light and display his more heroic and princely side. In the end, it is Umehito's love and desire to protect his little sister that endears him to her, as he braves daylight to save Kirimi. He collapses right after exposing himself to sunshine, but Kirimi finds him a place in her heart for his willingness to brave that which he loathes so much to protect her. At the end of volume 8 of the manga, it is shown that Kirimi has turned into a nearly identical darkness fanatic. Both sport dark cloaks and have their features covered, but Kirimi carries a giant plush kitty instead of a Beelzeneff puppet. Despite the Host Club's efforts to help him brave the sun, he is still just as obsessed with his occult passions. In the Halloween episode, he appears before Tamaki from a coffin and offers his services to help scare the student body. In Volume 3 of the manga, the Host Club stay at Umehito's private beach and mansion, not Kyoya's, although Umehito does not attend dinner because Haruhi switched the lights on and caused him to go into shock. The Host Club – Mori, Honey, the twins, and Haruhi –also see Umehito without his cloak and wig for the first time as he comes out to see what is wrong when Haruhi is taken to the bathroom. It is unclear if he realizes that Haruhi is a girl. It is possible he knows her secret and does not care, as she spent the whole vacation in a dress instead of her typical boyish clothes. In the volume 18 extras, he is seen as a college student, hugging Kirimi, an elementary school student; she is attempting to put his wig on his head, and Hatori noted that they still got along very well. He is also seen briefly in the August 2011 special chapter, terrifying Tamaki with spooky stories. The Nekozawa family traces their heritage to the Tokarev Dynasty in Russia, suggesting that Nekozawa family may work with gun manufacturing companies (a firearm appears in the manga, and as a symbol in the anime). Portrayed by: Ryo Ryusei Ritsu Kasanoda is the successor to the third generation master of the Kasanoda-gumi, the most powerful yakuza group in Kantō, Japan. Since Kasanoda's features have been intimidating since birth, his father claims he has the right face to become the most frightening yakuza boss in history and raises him to be the next leader. He is trained to appear tough and unapproachable so most see him as a very intimidating person and he has few friends. Kasanoda therefore initially does not talk much, though he can be angered easily. He is most well known for his long red hair and frightening face. Despite his outward appearance and upbringing, however, he tends to be a kind person who enjoys helping others. His classmates have nicknamed him as the feared \\"human blizzard\\". Haruhi calls him \\"Casanova\\", while Tamaki and the Hitachiin twins call him \\"Bossa Nova\\". Kasanoda initially seeks to apprentice under Morinozuka, hoping to become as respected and admired as he. He suffers humiliation at the hands of the Host Club members out of a desire to learn how to make friends and be able to have fun with people. Later experiences concerning a member of his household named Tetsuya show him that there are already people at his home who know his good side; they do not mention it because they know he is not only kind-hearted, but also shy and easily embarrassed. Due to Kasanoda habit of not knocking before entering a room, he becomes the first person at Ouran High outside the Host Club to discover that Haruhi is a girl. He had a confused crush on her prior to learning she is a girl and consequently falls in love with Haruhi and attends the Host Club as a customer. When he tries to admit his feelings to Haruhi, he is rejected with no ill intent, as she considers him an understanding friend (due to Kasanoda saying she could be at ease because he had come to see her so Haruhi could talk to someone who knew her secret). Since Kyoya tells Kasanoda that Haruhi must appear to be male for \\"special reasons\\", he resolves to not cause her any trouble by publicly stating they will be \\"friends\\" forever so she will not have to worry about being thought odd by associating romantically with him. Kasanoda does not realize that the special reasons consist of Haruhi's debt to the club. Ever since that incident, though, his desire to have friends is fulfilled when everyone in the Host Club, hosts and customers, agree to become his friends. He joins the Gardening Society of the school and on multiple occasions gifts Haruhi with food he has grown. In episode 25 of the anime he is seen surrounded by female students, apparently embarrassed but not angry. He appears in numerous chapters helping the Host Club. In chapter 80 of the manga, Kyoya used both the police and Kasanoda's clan to secure a route to the airport so that Tamaki could arrive on time to meet his mother. In the volume 18 extras, Kasanoda is shown at the beginning of his romantic relationship with Mei Yasumura, who is informing him (to his astonishment) that Haruhi is pregnant, and commanding him to knit something for the baby; his friend Tetsuya Sendo can be seen in the background, cheering him on and voicing his approval of Mei. A special chapter released in July 2011 in Lala revealed how he met Mei: when he is a first-year undergraduate business student at Ouran University, the twins send Kasanoda to Mei as a replacement model for her fashion show (they were originally the ones who were going to model). They eventually becomes friends, despite his being initially intimidated by her brashness and argumentative nature (he himself comments that she seems more like a yakuza than he does, at least in her use of profanity), what he sees as her excessive amounts of makeup, and her style of dressing. She even encourages him at one point to make a move on Haruhi (whom she knows he still has a crush on) while Tamaki is in the United States by showing her his carpentry skills; her reason for doing so is that she feels that he should learn to be confident in himself and what he does. It is the fact that she needs him and needs his help, however, that eventually appeals to him the most, although no romantic relationship is formed at the time. It is implied that it takes a few years for them to finally date, since their entry-level occupations (Mei is a rookie designer, Kasanoda a florist), rather than their student statuses, are listed in the volume 18 extra about their futures. In the volume 18 extra, it is also noted that Kasanoda eventually becomes the manager of a flower shop and the head of the Kasanoda-gumi. Seika Ayanokoji is a student of Class 3-A (and thus Honey and Mori's classmate) who only appears as a minor antagonist in the first chapter of the series. Haughty and narcissist, she is a regular at the Host Club and enjoys getting the attention of all six boys. This is cut short, however, when Haruhi, as the newest seventh member, becomes the center of attention, even before her revelation as a girl. Ayanokoji degrades Haruhi and throws away her book bag that had her wallet in it, which ends up in the fountain in front of the academy. When the Host Club boys learn about this, all six of them ban her from ever stepping inside the Host Club for having insulted one of their own, causing her to run away. In the live-action TV adaptation, instead of running away dishonorably after her plan is discovered, Ayanokoji is touched by Haruhi's decision to forgive her enough for her to donate food for the Host Club, and the Club boys likewise allow her to keep receiving their services. She also appears in the last episode to help lift the mood for the Club's second anniversary and convince Shizue Suou that the Club is not a mere \\"playground\\". Portrayed by: Ai Okawa Kanako Kasugazaki is the subject of help for the Host Club in episode 2 of the anime. Initially, Kanako was well known for host hopping (changing hosts very often, the usual practice being for a girl to designate a permanent host), but she only did this to spite her fiancé, Tohru Suzushima, into paying attention to her. She was unsuccessful until Tamaki learns of their situation and decides to help. She makes a cameo appearance in episode 13 as the dodo from Alice in Wonderland and is seen waiting for her lost love to come back. In the anime, she is the first person Haruhi ever kisses, by accident, during a ball organized by the Host Club where they executed Tamaki's plan to bring Kanako and Tohru together. She appears in later chapters stating that Tohru is working hard in England and wishing to help Tamaki. Shirō Takaoji is the subject of help for the Host Club in episode 6 of the anime. He is a painfully honest person, first pointing out that one of Tamaki's clients looks like a carp (her lips are thick), next stating that the twins are homosexual literally to one another (that Hikaru is homosexual towards Kaoru and that Kaoru is homosexual towards Hikaru), and finally that Haruhi is a cross-dresser. He is in love with a girl in his grade who is moving away and asks to be taught how to make women happy; in his music class, he is supposed to play a duet with the girl he likes, but prefers to just hear her play. Tamaki teaches him the song so they can play together and the young lovebirds end up corresponding through mail. In the manga, he is later \\"loaned\\" to Kasanoda in an attempt to make him cuter. He made a cameo appearance in episode 13 as a mouse and appears in the later chapters of the manga complaining that Tamaki had yet to take him to an amusement park. In the anime, at the end of episode 6, Shirō's pose is a nod to his voice actor's more famous role as the titular character in Naruto. Ayame Jōnōchi is Kyōya's and Tamaki's classmate and the class vice- chairman of 2-A. Ayame becomes Haruhi's tutor when Haruhi fails to rank at the top of her grade. Despite hating Tamaki for his eccentricities and the fact that he is always second in class (Ayame being consistently third after Tamaki comes to Ouran), she has a crush on the Host Club President. Initially, she permed her hair straight, but after Tamaki's advice, she reverted to her natural wavy hairstyle and became a regular at the Host Club. She is known for her ability to speak for a long time in a single breath; as such, her nickname among the club members is \\"Morse Code Lady\\". In the anime, her appearances are limited to a cameo in episode 24, when Tamaki introduces himself to her. In the live action series, in place of Kanako, she is the girl who receives a kiss from Haruhi at the ball. Portrayed by: Aoi Nakabeppu Michelle of Monale , the princess of a fictional European country of Monaru, gives an official visit to Ouran Academy in place of her older brother, Laurence. Tamaki is willing to serve her lavishly, in part due to her supposed resemblance to his own mother. Michelle, who is spoiled, exploits this and orders him and the rest of the Host Club to treat and respect her with various gifts and other amenities. Eventually, it is revealed that she did not come to Japan due to an official visit; instead, she is running away from home in protest of her brother neglecting to care her as a sister due to his busy schedule in running the country. Tamaki, who already knew this from the start, advises her that she should understand her brother's situation and not be a selfish individual. When Laurence comes to convince Michelle to come back, she realizes that he does care for her and returns to Monaru. Michelle's story arc from the manga is the focal point of the series' 2012 live-action film. She also becomes more sympathetic in that her reasons for coming to Japan is not just to attract attention from her brother, but also to raise the prestige of the Monaru family (which in the film is based in Singapore, instead of Europe), who has fallen on hard times, by creating a partnership with the Suou family. Portrayed by: Mariko Shinoda Reiko Kanazuki is a student of Class 1-D and the only female member of the Black Magic Club, headed by Nekozawa. She has no friends apart from her fellow members of the Black Magic Club and is very quiet and discreet. She claims to have practiced many curses including one that is supposedly able to make someone fall in love with another. As she gets to know the Host Club members better, Reiko begins to romantically attach herself with Honey, who is two years her senior. She is also one of the Host Club associates who help Tamaki to reunite in time with his mother, Anne-Sophie, by convincing Tamaki's father, Yuzuru, to agree on Nekozawa's plan in faking a stomachache to stall Anne-Sophie from boarding the plane. Chapters published post-epilogue show that Reiko does indeed marry Honey in the future. In the live-action TV adaptation, Reiko's portrayal is a composite of her original role in the manga as well as the Nekozawa's family maid who personally cares for Umehito's little sister, Kirimi. Portrayed by: Hana Sugisaki Megumi Kanoya is a girl who transfers from Aoizuka School in Kobe to Ouran Academy around the time of New Year. She is estranged from her father, who owns restaurants in the Kansai region. Megumi crosses paths with the Host Club during a horse riding event in which Megumi would have been hit by a wild horse had Tamaki not help her. The event apparently makes the two grow closer and Megumi becomes a sort of a love rival to Haruhi. This is not helped by the fact that Tamaki, who has grown depressed after he nearly lost Haruhi in a kidnapping, gradually drifts apart from the rest of the Host Club in favor of Megumi and even tells Haruhi that they do not seem to have anything in common, while he and Megumi do. Haruhi and the Host Club organize an event for the two to measure their relationship. In the end they conclude that Tamaki is just masking his true self, with Haruhi scolding Tamaki to stop doing it since he would destroy himself if he does so. Tamaki then reveals that he is never attracted to Megumi at all and was just searching for a temporary solace, while Megumi admits to Haruhi that she also did the same to escape from her familial problems, which are quickly resolved when Megumi is called back to reconcile by her father. However, Haruhi tells Megumi that the latter did fall in love genuinely with Tamaki for a while and that it made her jealous. Zuka Club members Benio Amakusa is the President of the Zuka Club. She is nicknamed \\"Benibara-sama\\" at St. Lobelia's Girl Academy and is the most popular of the Zuka Club's ruling council. Benio is also known as \\"The Lady of the Crimson Rose\\" and is the anime's first openly homosexual female to be introduced. She is the only character who recognizes Haruhi's gender, despite her androgynous appearance, upon meeting her. A \\"Benibara-sama's guardian club\\" exists at St. Lobelia's just to ensure she isn't mobbed when walking around campus. She has a large fan club devoted to her, as she flirts with girls with the same ease as Tamaki, with whom she shares personality traits such as over-confidence and a melodramatic nature. On one occasion, Benio claims that she is following in the footsteps of her mother, who was supposedly a past president of the Zuka Club in her day. In the manga, it is revealed to be a ruse to show the foolishness of men. She refers to herself with the Japanese first-person pronoun boku, which is used predominantly by males, although in increasing usage by females. Chizuru Maihara , also known as \\"The Lady of the Lily\\", is the Vice-President of the Zuka Club. She appears to be the most placid member of the club's ruling council, but she never objects to any of the club's plans, rather assisting and making things worse. Chizuru believes that all men are a lower form of life and finds the Host Club's bewilderment at her immunity to their charms amusing. Hinako Tsuwabuki Youngest member of the Zuka Club's leading council, , also known as \\"The Lady of the Daisy\\", is in her first year of high school at Lobelia Girls' Academy. She is the most energetic of the three girls and, as acknowledged by Chizuru, seems to be very intelligent. Her club tends to bother Haruhi, thinking that she should not wear a boy's uniform and insisting that Haruhi should join the Zuka Club. Recurring characters Ryoji \\"Ranka\\" Fujioka Anime screenshot depicting \\"Ranka\\". , Haruhi's father, works at a cross-dressing bar (okama) under the name . He considers himself to be bisexual, although after his wife's death he said he could never love another woman. In the American dub, his sexual orientation is never stated, but he says that Haruhi's mother did not care that he was a cross- dresser and she was the only one that mattered. In contrast to Haruhi's practicality and lack of interest in material things, he is bad with money and buys girly clothing for Haruhi hoping she will dress more cutely. He repacks her suitcase for an overnight trip in episode 8 of the anime, replacing the clothes she had packed with a dress. Haruhi's stubborn self-reliance causes her father to worry about her a lot; he would like to be more involved in her life and do more for her, but she rarely lets him. However, the two have a loving relationship. While her father would like to be able to take care of Haruhi, it seems that she often has to take care of him instead, as shown in a flashback in which a very young Haruhi refuses to allow him to go to parents' day at her school because she wants him to stay home and rest. There is a marked similarity between Haruhi's father and Tamaki, upon which several other members of the Host Club have commented. Because of this, and as a result of Tamaki's romantic affection for Haruhi, Ryōuji has stated that he considers Tamaki an enemy, and seems to take amusement in picking on him. In the volume 18 extra pertaining to his future and that of Tamaki's parents, he is seen about to dump a vat of water on Tamaki's head, having been informed by Anne- Sophie that Tamaki was planning to ask for his permission to marry Haruhi. Hatori also noted in the extra that Ryōuji and Tamaki's parents got along very well; she meant to include their relationship in one of the Boston chapters, but the short comic included in the extra seems to take place between the events of the July and August 2011 Lala special chapters, since Haruhi and Tamaki are not engaged in the July 2011 special. In one of the later extra chapters of the manga, it is shown that Ryōji was very protective of his wife before they started dating, to the point that he quit his job at that time to make sure she was always safe, and he found her to be a very \\"cool\\" person. He is described by some of the characters in the anime and manga as prettier than Haruhi, even when she is wearing a dress. Portrayed by: Shigeyuki Totsugi Kotoko Fujioka was Haruhi's mother, who died when her daughter was approximately five years old, as deduced from Haruhi's statement in the first episode that it had been ten years since her mother died. Kotoko was an attorney at law and remains Haruhi's primary role model in life. If the way in which Haruhi recalls her in her memories and dreams is accurate, she was a dedicated and loving mother who wished the best for her family. One can assume she was also open-minded to live with and love her husband, Ryoji (aka \\"Ranka\\") not only because of his bi-sexuality, but also because he was six years younger than she. Ryoji states that Kotoko was both beautiful, intelligent and a closet fan of the St. Lobelia's Zuka Club of her day. In later chapters, it is shown that she was popular at law school and, in a later omake, that while she found Ryoji to be strange and annoying, she liked him from the first moment they met as she found him cute, a trait to which she was vulnerable. Portrayed by: Ami Suzuki Yuzuru Suoh is the patriarch of the Suoh family and chairman of Ouran Academy. He is the 48-year-old father of Tamaki and his hobbies are golf, theater, and teasing his son. Despite knowing of his mother, Shizue's loathing of Tamaki, he can do little to help the situation. He does rebel against his mother's wishes several times though, first when he divorced the woman his mother had chosen for him in favor of retaining his relationship with Tamaki's mother, Anne-Sophie, and also when he and Kyoya's father, Yoshio, fire Shizue from her position as head of the Suoh family, which sends her into a depression. Yuzuru shares some of his son's characteristics, including an eccentric way of thinking, playfulness, penchant for concocting bizarre plans that actually work, and tendecy to sit in a corner whenever he is kicked out or made fun of. He is very much interested in his son's activities and becomes sad when Tamaki does not want to go along with it. What the father had in mind was to have Tamaki surpass him in terms of capabilities, so that he may inherit the Suoh empire and force his grandmother to accept his mother. At the end of the series, after her son manages to reunite with his mother after years, Yuzuru meets with Shizue at the Suoh mansion, the two beginning to mend their broken relationship. He agrees to his mother's comments of Haruhi being a wonderful girl after she surprises them by criticizing their lack of communication with each other. In the volume 18 extras, he is seen in one extra sitting around a kotatsu with Tamaki, Anne-Sophie and Shizue, discussing getting a kotatsu large enough to accommodate Haruhi and Ryoji, while another extra has him discussing Tamaki and Haruhi's forthcoming marriage with Anne-Sophie, Ryoji, and Shizue. In the anime, Yuzuru's personality is quite different, since his true personality had not been revealed at the time the anime aired. He is cold and mean to Tamaki and does not seem to accept him being a student at the school. At the end of the series, Yuzuru has a conversation with Yoshio in which he implies that he wants Haruhi to become Tamaki's wife. Portrayed by: Takeshi Masu Anne-Sophie de Grantaine is Tamaki's mother. She has blonde hair and violet eyes, traits that her son inherited, and has fondness for many things that Tamaki also has, including piano and an obsession with kotatsu. Anne-Sophie was born in France and met Yuzuru Suoh, Tamaki's father, in Paris while he was on a business trip. The two fell in love and she became his mistress. When Tamaki was born she was forbidden by Yuzuru's mother to return to Japan with him. Anne-Sophie raised Tamaki in France until he was fourteen, about three years before the start of the series. Anne-Sophie is often very sick. At the time, Yuzuru's mother was worried that the Suoh family would be without an heir and offered Anne-Sophie money in exchange for allowing Tamaki to live in Japan, never to see his mother again. Faced with the failure and debt of her family's business, Anne- Sophie tearfully accepted, going into hiding after Tamaki's departure. No one knows where she is, though Yuzuru has some idea. During the second year school trip to France, Kyoya finds her and discovers that she is living quite healthily, thinking of her son every day. In chapter 77, they find out that Anne-Sophie suffers from systemic lupus erythematosus. She is finally reunited with Tamaki thanks to his friends who helped him get to the airport in time for her departure after a brief visit to Japan. Although she returns to France, she is no longer forbidden from seeing Tamaki. In the volume 18 extras, she is apparently living in Japan, with Tamaki managing to get her and his father and grandmother to sit in a kotatsu as he has dreamed since he was young. She is also later seen with her husband, mother-in-law, and Haruhi's father, Ryoji, discussing about Tamaki and Haruhi's impending marriage. In the anime, Anne-Sophie's situation is somewhat different. She works as the housekeeper of the Tonerre family and knows the young heiress, Éclair. She tells young Éclair a lot about Tamaki, which makes the heiress curious about what kind of person he could be; and thus she goes to Japan to visit him and tells him that if he marries her, she will make sure he is reunited with Anne- Sophie. In the end, the engagement is broken off and Éclair deems Tamaki a fool, though she still plans for him to reunite with his mother. In the live action series, her ethnicity is French/Japanese. Portrayed by: Naomi Zaizen Shizue Suoh is Yuzuru's mother and Tamaki's grandmother who acts as the matriarch and head of the Suoh family. Introduced in the series as the main antagonist, she is responsible for bringing Tamaki to Japan and forbidding him from ever seeing his mother again. She is hateful and mean, being one of the only people Honey hates. She strongly dislikes Tamaki for being the child of her son's mistress and refers to him as a \\"filthy child\\". Strict and old fashioned, she puts the Suoh business before everything else. Throughout the series, Shizue also shows she has plans for Tamaki and the Host Club. Thanks to the Suoh's lawyer, Kousaka, Shizue finally allows Tamaki to enter the main residence, though she still does not acknowledge him. Once he is there, she tells him of how he has messed up Haruhi Fujioka's life by making her hide her gender and deceive the whole school. She also forbids him from participating in Host Club activities, an order which Tamaki obeys. As she starts living in the same residence as her grandson, Shizue is slowly charmed by his extravagant, yet kind self. Yuzuru orders her retirement after his and Yoshio Ootori's companies discover a medicine for Tamaki's mother, which causes her to seclude herself inside her room. Falling into depression, it is Tamaki who helps her regain her spirit by playing the piano for her, leading to the discovery that they have a lot in common, such as the same interests in movies and TV series. After witnessing how far the Host Club goes to make Tamaki see his mother before she leaves, Shizue lets him go as long as he will come back to play the piano for her. After this, she also allows him to return to the Host Club and eventually accepts Tamaki's relationship with Haruhi. This is exemplified in chapter 82 when she forcefully has him dressed in her late-husband's kimono, his \\"most formal attire\\", before Tamaki goes on a date with Haruhi. Portrayed by: Kyoko Enami Yoshio Ootori , Kyoya's father, is the patriarch of the Ootori family. Yoshio is portrayed as a cold, calculating father. Kyōya tries hard to please him to become heir of the family, despite the fact that his father apparently shows no understanding for his children and has planned out the lives of his sons as his successors already. In the manga, he acknowledges Kyoya as a possible successor despite being the third son. In the anime, he states he has already decided Kyoya would inherit Ootori Medical from him (in the manga, he states it is a possibility), only to have his third son buy it and return it to his control without ever revealing his identity. He also wants Haruhi to become Kyoya's wife, although in the manga, they never cross paths with each other. Portrayed by: Akihiro Shimizu Fuyumi Shido , maiden name is Kyoya's older sister. She clearly cares for her younger brother and tries to help him in life. She is somewhat lacking in the areas of housework and organization as any time she tries to help Kyoya packing clothes they end up all over the place literally, but appears to be a kind-hearted person. The manga reveals that she is married, but returned home once in a while. She, like Tamaki, also has a thing for \\"commoner's food\\". Isao \\"Misuzu\\" Sonoda is Ranka's colleague at the cross dressing bar. He runs a pension in Karuizawa, Nagano, where Haruhi works during summer vacation. He holds a contest among the hosts over who will be the most refreshing and able to stay at the pension; he is swayed by Kaoru and Hikaru after a display of \\"brotherly love\\" earns them \\"100 refreshing points\\". His real name is . He was formerly a banker and has a love for making frilly Lolita-type clothing. Mei Yasumura is Misuzu Sonoda's ganguro daughter. She only appears in the manga. Mei hates her father for being a cross-dresser, as it was the reason her parents divorced and left her without a proper father figure for most of her childhood. Yasumura is her stepfather's surname, since Mei's custody was given to her mother after the divorce. Misuzu gets the Fujiokas to keep an eye on his daughter for a while, as she keeps running away from him and refuses to stay at his house. During her stay at the Fujiokas, Haruhi secretly prepares meals for Mei using Misuzu's recipes, such as jam and demiglace sauce, which Tamaki obtains from Misuzu by working part-time at the pension. Mei eventually sees through Tamaki's plan and reconciles with Misuzu by requesting some more of his cooking. One of Mei's favourite hobbies is creating her own fashions and she loves seeing her clothes on other girls. Mei is so dedicated to this hobby that she is willing to wake up early in the morning to sew a new dress and sometimes gets so carried away that her homework is neglected. When she discovers that the mother of Hikaru and Kaoru is the famous designer Yuzuha Hitachiin, Mei persuades Haruhi to accept an invite to the twins' mansion so Mei can meet her idol in person. Yuzuha lives up to Mei's expectations and together they try to photograph Haruhi wearing cute outfits designed by Yuzuha. From the moment she saw Tamaki, Mei develops a crush on him and enlists Haruhi's reluctant help to attract his attention. She moves out of it, however, when she suspects that Tamaki might be in love with Haruhi and vice versa, and she is the first to notice Haruhi's feelings towards Tamaki. As they become better friends, Mei provides Haruhi with love advice, using a girls' magazine to help Haruhi understand her relationship with Tamaki; her assistance gives Tamaki an advantage over Hikaru in confessing his feelings to Haruhi. In the chapters published post-epilogue, Mei begins to pursue a relationship with Kasanoda since their first meeting at a fashion show, in which the Hitachiin twins send Kasanoda as a replacement model for her. When she realizes that Kasanoda still has a crush on Haruhi, Mei advises him to grow closer with her by showing her his carpentry skills, but this ends up making the two attracted to each other instead. Yasuchika Haninozuka is Honey's younger brother, whom Honey calls \\"Chika-chan\\". He often feels overshadowed by his older brother and has grown a lasting resentment towards him for enjoying things that are cute and dropping out as the Karate Club's President. He is also very astonished by the amount of cake he eats in one night and how quickly he does so. Yasuchika's greatest ambition is to one day finally defeat his brother in combat, but in the end Honey easily defeats him, choosing the things he loves most over his brother's feelings, much to Mori's surprise. Yasuchika's best friend is Satoshi Morinozuka, the younger brother of Mori, who also attends Ouran Middle School like himself. Both seem to be polar opposites of their older brothers, however, it is shown that underneath Yasuchika's attitude, he is much like Honey, crying easily and collecting cute stuffed toy chicks and chick photo books. In the chapters published post- epilogue, it is revealed that both Yasuchika and Satoshi attend Ouran Academy upon graduation, following their brothers' footsteps, and Yasuchika is lured by Satoshi to participate in the reformed Host Club, now Animal Husbandry Club, by promising him stuffed toys. Satoshi Morinozuka is Mori's younger brother. He is the captain of the Kendo Club and member of the Karate Club. He attends Ouran Middle School along with Yasuchika. Compared to Mori, Satoshi is talkative and cheerful. He takes his role as a Morinozuka seriously, going so far as to hit Yasuchika with a kendo stick when he is being rude. During one of his visits to the Host Club, the twins add Tabasco sauce to Satoshi's tea, which he then declares is delicious, leaving other characters to doubt that he has any taste buds. In contrast to Yasuchika's disdain for Honey, Satoshi adores his Mori and converts any criticism of Mori into something reasonably positive. He does not appear in the anime and has only appeared briefly in one of the later chapters of the manga. In the volume 18 extras, it is revealed that Satoshi attempts to keep the Host Club going during the Hosts' year in Boston, in order to preserve his brother's and Tamaki's legacy; in order to lure Yasuchika into helping him by promising toys. However, he then adds animals, and the Host Club morphs into an Animal Husbandry Club. Yuzuha Hitachiin is Hikaru and Kaoru's mother. Hitachiin is her maiden name; she does not change her surname as the Hitachiin carries a higher prestige than that of her husband, . She is a fashion designer who is famous throughout the world. Her sons' mischievous attitude seem to have been inherited from her, in contrast to Hayato's reserved and quiet personality. She eventually employs Mei Yasumura as an assistant fashion designer, the latter of whom is a big fan of her and shares a common fashion sense with her. Post-epilogue, Yuzuha is revealed to have given birth to a third child: a daughter named Ageha. Kirimi Nekozawa is Umehito's little sister. She is 3 years old and has light blonde hair and blue eyes like her brother. As with the rest of the Nekozawa, Kirimi is descended from the Tokarev dynasty line in Russia, but unlike her brother, she does not inherit their family curse, that is, extreme sensitivity to light. She does, however, have fears of darkness and cats, both exact opposites of Umehito, which is troubling since the Nekozawa naturally attracts cats. Kirimi has never met Umehito due to her fear of darkness and his fear of light and only knows about his existence through stories told by her servants as well as a single portrait in her family mansion that depicts him in a knightly manner. Because of this, she mistakenly assumes Tamaki, who also has blonde hair, as her brother, and he decides to play along with it until Umehito is ready to meet her. Kirimi's servants apparently teach her beyond what is acceptable for her age, with her knowing such terms as harem and debauchery because of her love of shōjo manga. Because Kirimi cannot face her fear of darkness, the Host Club members have to force Umehito to face his fear of light instead which they have some success with when he manages to resist flashlights, but not enough to actually go outside. However, when Kirimi is chased by a cat outdoor, Umehito braves himself to rescue her and reveals his true appearance to Kirimi beneath the black wig and hood, although he immediately collapses shortly after. The two appear to have grown closer afterward when she smiles at Umehito's shy attempt to get her attention through Belzeneff. Later chapters show that Kirimi has also conquered her fear of darkness and begins to tag along with her brother in wearing hood and being \\"creepy\\". Portrayed by: Mone Sawada Takeshi Kuze is the president of Ouran's American Football Club, the Ouran Orages (the word comes from the French for \\"Tempest\\"), referred to by Tamaki as the most talented of all of Ouran's athletic clubs. Kuze has a long-standing rivalry with Kyoya, despite the fact they were once childhood friends, partly due to Kuze's habit of eating oranges with the rind still on. His family holds the largest share of imported produce in Japan. Kuze and Kyoya's rivalry have results in several battles between the Host Club and the Football Club. For example, there is a battle between them to see who can get the prime space at the school's cultural festival, which is decided by holding a race, which the Host Club win. Portrayed by: Tomohiro Ichikawa Kazukiyo Sōga is the Class President of 1-A, who suffers from nyctophobia (severe fear of the dark) and a fear of just about anything that is scary. He has romantic feelings for Class 1-A's Vice-President Momoka, whom he has known for years, but he is initially too shy to say anything. Hikaru and Kaoru comment that he is the kind of person with pure feelings who they cannot tease, possibly because he is more emotionally vulnerable than Tamaki. In the manga, he unwittingly caused Haruhi trouble with her scholarship when he ranked as the top student of his grade. Volume 6 reveals that his father is a famous politician. In the volume 18 extras, he is seen as a college student, confessing nervously to Momoka as Haruhi and the twins cheer him on from a distance; he and Momoka are also seen in the July 2011 special chapter, as first-year students in the law faculty along with Haruhi (whom they still call Haruhi-kun, despite knowing her gender). Momoka Kurakano is the Class Vice-President of 1-A. Originally fond of Haruhi, she is a frequent client of hers in the Host Club. In the volume 18 extras, she is seen as a college student, smiling as Soga confesses nervously to her; she and Soga are also seen in the July 2011 special chapter, as first-year students in the law faculty along with Haruhi (whom they still call Haruhi-kun, despite knowing her gender). Portrayed by: Nana Seino Arai is Haruhi's middle school friend who lives near Karuizawa, which Haruhi and the Host Club visit during summer holiday. As he completely lost contact with Haruhi after graduation, the two are surprised when they meet in Misuzu's summer house. The two begin to exchange stories and recount their experiences since graduation, inciting jealousy on Hikaru's part, who is discontented and goes mad whenever he sees the two becoming closer. His patience reaches its nadir when Arai stumbles upon Haruhi and Hikaru while they are walking together through a market, and Hikaru lashes out on the two before leaving, assuming that the two would come back home together. However, Misuzu later gets a phone call from Arai who states that Haruhi had allowed him to go home earlier, which means that she is still out there somewhere, hiding from the thunderstorm. Arai and Hikaru then make amends at the end of the holiday. Portrayed by: Ryutarou Akimoto Yūko Kōsaka is the lawyer of the Suoh family. She was a junior of Haruhi's mother, Kotoko, back when she was alive, and was close to her enough to know that Haruhi does indeed resemble her mother quite a lot. Haruhi mistakenly assumes her to be her mother at first, suggesting that she may resemble Kotoko as well. As it is revealed, Kousaka is sent by Shizue Suoh to spy on and gather information about the Host Club, especially Haruhi, and report them to her immediately. This is suspected by Kyoya since the time of the New Year's celebration where Kousaka \\"coincidentally\\" goes to the same shrine as the Host Club, though he is too distracted by Haruhi's kidnapping at that time to learn more about her. These information persuade Shizue to allow Tamaki back to the main mansion but forbid him to run the Host Club, since according to her, it messes up Haruhi's life and threatens her with danger, including the aforementioned kidnapping. This leads to the Host Club's disbandment and Haruhi and Tamaki's temporary estrangement with each other. However, when Haruhi and Tamaki have reconciled and the Suoh as a whole resolved their differences, Kousaka resigns from her job and moves to a small office, stating to Haruhi that she does not want to be involved in another messy affair like the Suoh family again. Shima Maezono is an old retainer of the Suoh family. She is stated to be 82 years old. She was originally a servant of the main mansion, but as per Shizue's orders she is to serve as Tamaki's personal assistant and tutor in the second mansion. Shima is quite strict on Tamaki and makes him study more to prepare himself as the heir of the Suoh. Shima moves back to the main mansion when Tamaki is allowed by Shizue to live there. Éclair Tonnerre An anime-only character, is the beautiful and shrewd heir to the France-based Grand Tonnerre Group, which in the anime employs Tamaki's mother as a servant in Éclair's house. Having heard a great deal about Tamaki from his mother, Éclair develops a crush on him and Tamaki's grandmother, who detests his mother, concocts a scheme to make him Éclair's husband. She tracks down Tamaki in Japan and convinces him to leave the Host Club, offering him a chance to see his mother if he complies with her wishes. She secures noninterference from the Ootori group by arranging for the Grand Tonnerre Group to buy Ootori Medical so as to control Kyoya's father. She does not immediately recognize Haruhi as a girl, however she does believe that Haruhi is Tamaki's male lover. This leads her to try to drive a wedge between Haruhi and Tamaki, with some degree of success. In the end, Tamaki leaves Éclair in order to save Haruhi's life, but not before leaving a good impression by genuinely smiling at her and thanking her for letting him go. She then asks her driver to head toward the airport without Tamaki, speaking of how wonderful and pure-hearted Tamaki is since he could smile at her after all that she had done. She reveals that Tamaki's mother is now a housekeeper at her house and it is suggested that she may somehow arrange for Tamaki to see his mother again. Her name is French for \\"lightning thunder\\". It symbolizes Haruhi's greatest fear, namely her fear of thunder, and thus her fear of Tamaki being taken away from her. Reception IGN praised the Host Club characters for being well-animated in the show, as they are made simpler without losing the details. The characters there are not only well-drawn, but also well-written. Haruhi Fujioka is \\"actually written smart and acts smart\\", as opposed to other anime protagonists who are claimed to be smart without apparent evidence in the show.

It is home to the city's only International Studies Program. The school first opened in 1974 for only 7th through 10th grade students, but each subsequent year, added a grade higher. The first graduating class was the class of 1976. In 2001, the 7th and 8th grade students, along with the 6th grade students from Brownsville Road Optional Elementary School, formed the new Craigmont Middle School at the opposite end of the same block. This was done both to help overcrowding and to reduce the extreme age and maturity gaps present in a single building. Before the physical split between junior and senior high schools, junior high students (those in grades 7, 8, & 9) remain relegated to the north end of the building for classes while those senior high students (grades 10, 11, & 12) attended the majority of their classes in the south end of the school building.

She came to national attention after her appearance in Jennie Livingston's 1990 documentary film Paris Is Burning, in which her life as a trans woman forms one of the film's several story arcs.  Early life  Xtravaganza was born on May 22, 1965, in Jersey City, New Jersey. Her parents were of Italian-American and Puerto Rican descent. She had four brothers. Xtravaganza took the name Venus in her early teens.  Career  Xtravaganza states in Paris Is Burning that she began cross-dressing and performing at age 13 or 14, placing her earliest performances around 1978 or 1979. Eventually, her family caught on to her lifestyle, and because she didn't \\"want to embarrass them, ... [she] moved away.\\" She relocated to New York City in order to be able to perform freely. Her ball career began in 1983, when House of Xtravaganza founder Hector Valle invited her to join the house. She stated that he \\"was the first gay that [I'd] ever met.\\" On her 15th birthday, Valle took her to Greenwich Village, threw her a party, and bought her a cake. After Valle died from AIDS-related complications in 1985, Angie Xtravaganza assumed the role of house mother, and she took on Xtravaganza as her mentee and drag daughter. At the time of filming Paris Is Burning, Xtravaganza was an aspiring model. She said, \\"I [want] my sex change to make myself feel complete.\\"  Death  On Christmas Day in 1988, Xtravaganza was found strangled under a bed at the Duchess Hotel in New York. It was estimated that her body had been there for four days upon discovery. Shooting for Paris Is Burning was ongoing, and the film's final minutes include Angie Xtravaganza reacting to her death. Angie Xtravaganza said she felt that Venus was one to take too many chances, that she \\"was too wild with people in the streets,\\" and that she feared \\"something [was] going to happen to [her].\\" Angie Xtravaganza was the first person detectives approached with the news of Xtravaganza's death, and it was she who broke the news to the latter's biological parents. In Paris Is Burning, Xtravaganza describes a time she narrowly escaped an attack by a man who discovered she was transgender during an intimate encounter, and it is possible her murder occurred during a similar situation. Her killer was never found. She is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in North Arlington, New Jersey.  Legacy  * In her book Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of \\"Sex\\", feminist scholar Judith Butler discusses Xtravaganza's interviews in the context of transgender identity and gender theory. * In the fall of 2013, a New York City theatre group presented a murder mystery play centered around a fictionalized account of Xtravaganza's murder. Members of the House of Xtravanganza stated in a press release on Facebook that they were not involved in the show's production and withheld their endorsement. In a later press release, they condemned the work as \\"inappropriate, opportunistic, and disrespectful to Venus' legacy.\\" Xtravaganza's biological family also expressed displeasure with the play. * In the reality television competition program RuPaul's Drag Race, contestants and judges frequently allude to lines from Paris is Burning, many of them Xtravaganza's. A notable example occurs in the second episode of the fourth season, when competitor Willam Belli refers to the opposing team in a challenge as \\"a bunch of overgrown orangutans,\\" a read (insult) Xtravaganza used in the documentary. * The House of Xtravaganza remains active in the ball circuit, nightlife, and LGBTQ activism. It is one of the oldest active houses in New York City. * In the documentary film How Do I Look, an award in her name was given to Jazmine Givenchy. The text of the award reads: \\"THE VENUS XTRAVAGANZA LEGENDS AWARD Presented To JAZMINE GIVENCHY Celebrating Black History And Culture Through The Rich Traditions Of The BALLROOM/HOUSE COMMUNITY\\".

It is served by the: *F and J trains at all times *M train at all times except late nights *Z skip- stop and <F> trains during rush hours in the peak direction In addition to the two track levels—the BMT platforms are on the upper level, and the IND platforms are on the lower—an intermediate mezzanine built for the IND platforms provides the passenger connection between the two lines. As the BMT and the IND were originally separate systems, the transfer passageway was not within fare control until July 1, 1948. The full-time entrance is on the north side of Delancey Street, on either side of Essex Street. __TOC__  Station layout  Since June 2010, both the F and the M operate local along the Sixth Avenue Line north of the Delancey Street/Essex Street station. This resulted in many riders waiting in the stairwells connecting the Sixth Avenue Line's lower-level northbound platform, where the F stops, and the Nassau Street Line's upper-level southbound platform, where the M stops before merging onto the Sixth Avenue Line northbound. This phenomenon did not occur in other stations where two services have separate platforms before merging into the same direction, such as 50th Street–Eighth Avenue. In 2017, the MTA installed train-arrival \\"countdown clocks\\" across the New York City Subway system, which show how much time will elapse until the next train arrives on each respective platform.

The IND station had four additional exits; two were at both the north end of the station at Rivington Street and the other two were at the south end at Broome Street. Two of the staircases were sealed on street level, but metal trapdoors block the other two. A former exit to the southeastern corner of Rivington Street and Essex Street, adjacent to the rear of the Essex Street Market building, remains as a northern emergency exit, and a former exit to the southeastern corner of Broome Street and Essex Street similarly remains as a southern emergency exit. As part of the construction of the nearby Essex Crossing development, Site 9 (120 Essex Street), located on the east side of Essex Street between Rivington and Delancey Streets, contains an easement for a future elevator entrance.  BMT Nassau Street Line platforms  Essex Street on the BMT Nassau Street Line has three tracks, one side platform, and one island platform. The side platform is used by trains coming from the Williamsburg Bridge. The other two tracks serve the island platform. The middle track, which was formerly the peak-direction express track, is now used for outbound J and Z trains over the Williamsburg Bridge. After a 2004 reconfiguration, the former northbound local track was taken out of regular service. It was only used for occasional reroutes from Chambers Street until 2010. The Chrystie Street Connection between Broadway–Lafayette Street and Essex Street was not used for regular revenue service from 1976 to 2010. On June 28, 2010, with the re-routing of M trains to the IND Sixth Avenue Line and IND Queens Boulevard Line, the connection again saw regular use for those aforementioned trains only. This station is a bottleneck for eastbound trains, which are frequently delayed momentarily at this station because the two eastbound tracks merge into one track before crossing the Williamsburg Bridge.  History  Williamsburg Bridge and Delancey Street, 1919. Kiosks in the center go down to the underground trolley terminal; larger one to the left goes to the subway. Foreground: waiting areas for Manhattan streetcars The Essex Street station during its construction. Next to the Brooklyn-bound local track is the closed Williamsburg Bridge Trolley Terminal, which was built along with the subway station and opened several months earlier. The terminal consisted of eight turning loops with low-level platforms which were used for trolley service from 1908 to 1948 that traveled over the Williamsburg Bridge to different parts of Brooklyn.http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/WillB.newphoto.jpg The underground terminal for the subway adjacent to the trolley terminal opened on September 16, 1908. The station initially contained only two tracks which ended at the west end of the station. It also had an additional southern side platform adjacent to the trolley terminal, with the station organized in a Spanish solution. The station was rebuilt for through service from 1911 to 1913 for the Centre Street Subway to extend to Chambers Street. The rest of the subway line has four tracks while there was room at Essex Street station for only three tracks and two platforms. There is provision for a fourth track to run through the trolley terminal area and join the subway west of the trolley terminal, should a four-track subway station be wanted. For many years, the elevated train service was very intensive, and the fourth track at Essex Street would have been useful to handle the crowds, but at the same time, the trolley service was also well patronized, so no expansion was ever proposed. This would have added a second side platform to the south of the southernmost track, directly against the trolley terminal. The island platform would have been demolished to make room for the fourth track; alternatively, the fourth track would have been constructed adjacent to the southernmost track, resulting in a 2 side-platform, 1 island-platformed station, similar to the IRT platforms at Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center. After streetcar service ended in 1948, the former track area on the south side of the bridge was rebuilt into auto lanes with a new ramp from street level closing off the former downhill ramp to the trolley terminal. The trolley terminal itself, however, was left vacant, and small portions were converted to storerooms and an emergency exit to the southern corners of Norfolk Street and Delancey Street.https://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?2159 The vacant space was the proposed location of the LowLine, a planned underground park, but after fundraising proved unsuccessful, the project was indefinitely postponed in February 2020. Prior to 1913, the BMT station was also known as Delancey Street.

The station has a part-time booth on the south side of Delancey Street and has two street staircases. Crossovers connect both platforms to the BMT platforms, which are above and perpendicular to the IND platforms. The tile band (purple with black border) and station name tablets have been replaced, replicating the style of the original design. In a departure from the norm of recent restorations, every other column at the platform level has a large \\"D\\" for the station name. The station formerly had two mezzanine areas, split by the BMT station. Twelve staircases, six on each platform, led to the mezzanine. Most were removed; only the stairs at the extreme north end and the extreme south end of both platforms remain as stairways to emergency exits and storage space. There are two large wall-sized pieces of artwork, one on each wall where the staircase exits and transfers are located. The artist for both glass mosaics is Ming Fay (2004). The artwork on the downtown side is titled Shad Crossing and details two giant shad fish swimming, along with another wall mosaic of blue waters. In the late 19th century, shad were found along the Hudson River when new immigrants came to New York, many of whom settled on the Lower East Side. The new staircase to the relocated full-time booth also has another painting of a shad wrapped around the bottom of the stairs. The uptown platform is titled Delancey Orchard and has a cherry orchard tree mosaic, which symbolized the tree owned by the Delancey family in the 18th century. Miniature versions appear along all staircases leading from the Delancey Street platforms to either fare control.

The band is composed of Brian Aubert, Nikki Monninger, Christopher Guanlao, and Joe Lester. The band released their debut EP, Pikul, in July 2005, and their debut album, Carnavas, on July 26, 2006. Their second album, Swoon, was released on April 14, 2009. Neck of the Woods, the band's third album, came out on May 8, 2012. They issued their fourth album, Better Nature, on September 25, 2015. Their fifth album, Widow's Weeds, came out on June 7, 2019. History Early years and Pikul EP (2000–2005) The band in 2005 The members of Silversun Pickups are friends who had played together previously. They began their career in Los Angeles clubs, most often at Silverlake Lounge or nearby Spaceland, and began to draw a strong following upon the release of the Pikul EP. The band originated in L.A.'s Silver Lake music scene, home of Rilo Kiley and others. They have been repeatedly rumored to have been originally named A Couple of Couples, as the original lineup was composed of a pair of romantically involved couples — lead guitarist and vocalist Brian Aubert was dating drummer Elvira Gonzales, while bassist Nikki Monninger was dating rhythm guitarist/record producer Jack Kennedy. However, the band has stated that this is untrue. The name Silversun Pickups was derived from a liquor store located across from Silverlake Lounge. One of the friends would often arrive at the store late at night to buy liquor, making a \\"Silversun Pickup\\". In interviews, the band has said its name is more of \\"a state of mind\\". Brian Aubert met Nikki Monninger in 1994 on a flight from Los Angeles to London. Both of them were headed to Cambridge for a school exchange program. Aubert noticed Monninger sitting across the aisle from him stealing alcohol from the drink cart by distracting the flight attendant. For the Pikul EP, fellow Silverlaker Tanya Haden was enlisted to play cello on the track \\"Kissing Families\\". Carnavas (2006–2007) On July 25, 2006, Silversun Pickups released their debut full-length album Carnavas. Two of the album's four singles, \\"Lazy Eye\\" and \\"Well Thought Out Twinkles\\", made the top 10 of the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in 2007. \\"Lazy Eye\\" is also featured in the video games Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero World Tour, one of only 13 songs to be featured in both games. The songs \\"Melatonin\\" and \\"Well Thought Out Twinkles\\" are also available as downloadable content for the Rock Band series. Forza Horizon, released in 2012, features \\"Lazy Eye\\" as a track played on \\"Horizon Rocks\\", one of three in-game radio stations. The band finished a three-week tour opening for Wolfmother on December 9, 2006, and later toured with OK Go and Snow Patrol on their U.S. spring tour, which ended on April 10, 2007. They also played at the Coachella Music Festival in Indio, California, on April 27, 2007, as well as various concerts for modern rock-formatted radio stations in the US throughout the year. They also toured the UK and Ireland while Carnavas was released there on May 28, 2007. The band opened for Foo Fighters in Edinburgh and Dublin. They also opened for the Kaiser Chiefs during their European tour. Carnavas peaked at No. 80 on the Billboard 200 and has sold 435,000 copies since its release. Swoon (2008–2010) Silversun Pickups' second album, Swoon,Alternative Press Issue No. 243 includes 10 tracks, and instead of having a straightforward mid-tempo sound, Aubert said: \\"Some songs are very quiet and delicate, [while] others are just [freaking] loud.\\" The album was released on April 14, 2009, to positive reviews. It debuted at No. 7, selling approximately 43,000 copies in its first week. The first single released was \\"Panic Switch\\", which aired on VH1 and MTV music video shows and radio stations worldwide. \\"Panic Switch\\" is also featured in the video games Rock Band and Rocksmith. Silversun Pickups played the 2009 Voodoo Music Experience Festival over the Halloween weekend. In 2009, the band performed \\"Catch and Release\\", \\"Panic Switch\\", \\"Lazy Eye\\", \\"Well Thought Out Twinkles\\", \\"Growing Old is Getting Old\\", and \\"Kissing Families\\" for MTV Unplugged. In early December 2009, the band was nominated in the Best New Artist category for the 52nd Grammy Awards. Their nomination drew some controversy, because the band was already moderately successful before the 2008-2009 nominating year, although this was mainly due to misunderstandings involving the selections of Best New Artist nominees. They supported Placebo on their Winter 2009 European tour. Upon the release of Swoon, they toured with Manchester Orchestra as main support. In spring 2010, the band toured with Muse for their US tour. They toured North America again in summer 2010 with Against Me! and The Henry Clay People. Another tour took place with Australian rock band Birds of Tokyo in September 2010 and ended an 18-month set of shows in support of Swoon at Austin City Limits. Neck of the Woods (2011–2013) The band released a three-song 10\\" vinyl single for Record Store Day's \\"Back to Black Friday\\" event on November 25, 2011 titled \\"Seasick\\". It was composed of three previously unreleased songs: \\"Seasick\\", \\"Broken Bottles\\", and \\"Ribbons and Detours\\". These were songs left over from the Swoon sessions, and were not put on their third studio album. The band also contributed a cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Not Dark Yet\\" for the tribute album Chimes of Freedom. On February 7, 2012, it was announced that Silversun Pickups would be playing the main stage at the 2012 Sasquatch! Music Festival. On March 7, 2012, Aubert confirmed via Twitter both the name of the album - Neck of the Woods \\\\- as well as the release date - May 8, 2012. Shortly afterward, the album artwork was posted to the band's Facebook account. On March 25, 2012, the first single from the new album, \\"Bloody Mary (Nerve Endings)\\", was released. The pre-order for Neck of the Woods also started. On May 8, 2012, Silversun Pickups' third album Neck of the Woods was released. It opened near the top of the iTunes top 100 albums and moved into the number one spot the following day. Around the same time, the band announced that they would be playing a number of high-profile summer music festivals. On May 30, 2012, the video to \\"Bloody Mary (Nerve Endings)\\" was released and announced on Twitter. On July 24, 2012, the band announced plans for a North American Tour beginning in September 2012. The tour took place on the West Coast, Midwest, and western Canada, with supporting acts including School of Seven Bells and Atlas Genius. In August 2012, Sarah Negahdari, singer and guitarist for The Happy Hollows, temporarily replaced Monninger for live performances while the latter was on maternity leave. Better Nature (2014–2017) On January 7, 2014, Silversun Pickups announced a compilation album entitled The Singles Collection, comprising 10 previously released songs, as well as the new track \\"Cannibal\\", which was also the lead single. A video for the song aired in the middle of February and the band appeared on the Jimmy Kimmel Live! show while performing in-store at Amoeba Music (Hollywood).\\"Stereogum Newsitem\\"\\" Tom Breihan, 'Silversun Pickups - \\"Cannibal\\" video & Kimmel performance' Stereogum, February 18, 2014.

It was released on September 25, 2015. In 2017, they featured as the one-band soundtrack to Aisha Tyler's feature film directorial debut, Axis. Widow's Weeds (2018–present) On June 28, 2018, Silversun Pickups posted a photo from a studio session, announcing they had broken ground on recording their fifth album. Butch Vig was mentioned in the post, potentially indicating he would be producing the album. Later, they posted a photo to their social media platforms from the studio with Vig, confirming his involvement. On April 11, 2019, the band released the video for the first single from the album, \\"It Doesn't Matter Why\\". The album, entitled Widow's Weeds, was released on June 7, 2019. A further two singles were released from the album: \\"Freakazoid\\" and \\"Don't Know Why\\". On June 10, 2020, Silversun Pickups released a 7\\" single titled \\"Toy Soldiers\\", a cover of the 1989 Martika song. Like Widow's Weeds, the cover was produced by Butch Vig. Musical style Silversun Pickups' sound on their first two albums, Carnavas and Swoon, often encompassing multiple overdubs of distorted guitars, is frequently compared to that of The Smashing Pumpkins and My Bloody Valentine. Rolling Stone Review by Evan Serpick. \\"...things take off with 'Well Thought Out Twinkles,' a surge of guitar squalls and male-female vocals that sounds like what might have happened if the Smashing Pumpkins had driven their ice cream cart out West.\\" NPR Song of the Day. Review by John Richards. \\"Silversun Pickups brings to mind a sort of alternate-universe Smashing Pumpkins.\\" Pitchfork Media review of Carnavas by Rachel Khong . \\"Those nostalgic for Smashing Pumpkins tunes of yesteryear will find them nestled inside the minutes (and there are so many minutes) of 'Lazy Eye'.\\" Later albums Neck of the Woods and Better Nature largely dropped that aspect of the music, instead focusing on the incorporation of electronic elements.

He also published the first comprehensive discographical reference work on punk rock and new wave music and founded the company One Ten Records. Education After coming to Ann Arbor in the late 1960s, B. attended the University of Michigan College of Art and Design. He was a member of the Art School Steering Committee, and worked under George Manupelli on the Ann Arbor Film Festival, the largest independent/experimental film festival of its kind. In or about 1972, B. became the manager of the Art Department of the University Cellar, the student-owned and student-run bookstore servicing the University community. One of his ideas during this time was to create \\"The Whole Art Catalog.\\" It was never realized, and would have encompassed a materials and equipment catalog on the creation of art, whether it be painted miniatures, or massive earthworks. George went to New York City in 1974 as a visual arts student at the Whitney Museum Studio Program. From 1975 to 1979, he co-directed performance artist Laurie Anderson’s stage show. One Ten Records formed In 1977, he formed One Ten Records and released the first commercial compilation of audio work by visual artists—a two record set entitled Airwaves, that included the initial recordings of Laurie Anderson and unreleased work by Meredith Monk. In 1980, he received a National Endowment for the Arts grant to produce recordings by visual artists, and in 1981 released Laurie Anderson’s first single “O Superman”. This single went to number two on the UK charts and reached the top 20 in 16 countries. It was eventually released by WEA and has sold close to a million copies worldwide. ARChive of Contemporary Music George cofounded the ARChive of Contemporary Music in New York City, which, with over two million sound recordings, the ARC is the largest popular music collection in the United States. The initial donation of 47,000 discs that began ARC’s collection came from B. himself, who accumulated them in the interval between moving to New York and publishing the International Discography, noted below. Publications In 1981, George published the first comprehensive discographical reference work on punk and new wave music, titled Volume, the International Discography of the New Wave. By its second edition in 1982, the book had grown to over 700 pages and was co-published and distributed internationally by Omnibus Press. Volume continues to be the definitive reference guide to this material, cited in The Readers Catalog, England's Dreaming, and many other publications. Other career achievements As a consultant, Mr. George selected soundworks for the Paris Biennale in 1981 and 1983, and for New Music America in 1984. From 1982 to 1985, he produced an occasional survey of new American pop and experimental music for the BBC that was broadcast as part of “The John Peel Show” in the UK. From the mid-to late 1990s, he helped program Arts & Events at NYC’s World Financial Center. George also co-produced singles by Orchestra Jazira (Ghana/UK) and Sonny Okuson (Nigeria). He has written about music for The Village Voice, Playboy, Creem, ELLE, Spin and Billboard. Mr. George was the music editor for Benetton’s Colors Magazine and has done occasional writing about \\"music & food\\" for Saveur Magazine. He contributed to the planning of and provided research material for Goodtime Kings by Billy Bergman (Planet Rock/Quarto Books, 1985), the first American book on contemporary African Pop. He has consulted on many film projects including Martin Scorsese’s The Last Temptation of Christ and Goodfellas, Tom Hanks' That Thing You Do, and Jonathan Demme’s Something Wild, Beloved and The Manchurian Candidate. From 1993-1999 Mr. George sat on the Blue Ribbon Awards Committee for ARSC (Association for Recorded Sound Collections) choosing the best music books published, and in '99-00 was a member of the Yahoo Academy, voting on the Internet Life Awards for outstanding websites.

She is the only surviving two-masted coasting cargo schooner built on the Gulf Coast of the United States, and is only one of five such surviving US-built ships. On 4 December 1991, she was added to the US National Register of Historic Places. One year later, the schooner was designated a US National Historic Landmark. She is presently berthed at Saint Andrews Marina in Panama City, Florida, where she is maintained by a nonprofit group. Sailing tours are regularly scheduled. Description and history Governor Stone has a wooden hull, long, with a beam of and a hold depth of . She has a pine keel, a frame of cypress, and decking and other finished surfaces of pine and juniper. Her two masts are pine, one in length and the other , which is fitted with a topmast giving it a total height of . The basic design of the vessel is described as typical of late 19th-century Gulf schooners. She has a poop deck with a small cabin, and the rest of her deck is divided into hatches providing access to the hold area. She was built in Pascagoula in 1877 for Charles Greiner, a merchant, and was named for John Marshall Stone, who was Governor of Mississippi at the time. Greiner owned a chandlery in Pascagoula, and used her to bring supplies and materials to deep- water ships outside the harbor. Subsequent owners used her as a buyboat, purchasing oyster catch from working fishermen and bringing it to shore. In 1906 she was capized during a hurricane and washed inland, but was successfully refloated. She sank during a storm at Bay St. Louis, Mississippi in 1939, but was again recovered. Renamed Queen of the Fleet, she entered into the tourist trade, carrying visitors on excursions at DeLisle, Mississippi. During World War II she was converted for use as a training vessel by the Merchant Marine Academy. After going through a succession of owners (and names) in the post-war years, she was given a careful restoration in the 1960s and 1970s. She became part of Eden Gardens State Park in 2003. However, the water in Tucker Bayou next to the park was too shallow for the boat to dock there. She was in Sandestin for a short time, then moved to Bay County. In 2007, the schooner was towed to a marina in Fort Walton Beach. In 2014, it was moved to its current home port at the St. Andrews Marina in the historic area of St. Andrews, Panama City, Florida. In October 2018, Governor Stone capsized at her dock during Hurricane Michael. The Friends of the Governor Stone organization is raising funds to salvage her.

Two additional shorted turns improve the isolation of the two outermost windings from each other and from the other, innermost windings. Right: The rotating portion of the rotary transformer showing three of the six tape heads } Cross-section diagram of a simple rotary transformer. Prior to the development of the rotary transformer, a slip-ring pickup was used, though this was prone to developing signal noise due to corrosion of the slip rings. A rotary (rotatory) transformer is a specialized transformer used to couple electrical signals between two parts that rotate in relation to each other. They may be either cylindrical or 'pancake' shaped. Slip rings can be used for the same purpose, but are subject to friction, wear, intermittent contact, and limitations on the rotational speed that can be accommodated without damage. Wear can be eliminated by using a pool of liquid mercury instead of a solid ring contact, but the toxicity and slow corrosion of mercury are problematic, and very high rotational speeds are again difficult to achieve. A rotary transformer has none of these limitations. Rotary transformers are constructed by winding the primary and secondary windings into separate halves of a cup core; these concentric halves face each other, with each half mounted to one of the rotating parts. Magnetic flux provides the coupling from one half of the cup core to the other across an air gap, providing the mutual inductance that couples energy from the transformer's primary to its secondary. In brushless synchros, typical rotary transformers (in pairs) provide longer life than slip rings. These rotary transformers have a cylindrical, rather than a disc-shaped, air gap between windings. The rotor winding is a spool-shaped ferromagnetic core, with the winding placed like thread on a spool. The flanges are the pole pieces. The stator winding is a ferromagnetic cylinder with the winding inside, and end poles that are discs with holes, like washers. Uses Rotary transformers are most commonly used in videocassette recorders, as well as other tape drives that use rotary heads to implement helical scan, such as those used for tape backup. Signals must be coupled from the electronics of the VCR or other tape drive to the fast-moving tape heads carried on the rotating head drum; a rotary transformer is ideal for this purpose. Most VCR designs require more than one signal to be coupled to the head drum. In this case, the cup core has more than one concentric winding, isolated by individual raised portions of the core. The transformer for the head drum shown to the right couples six individual channels. Another use is to transmit the signals from rotary torque sensors installed on electric motors, to allow electronic control of motor speed and torque using feedback. Because they are transformers, rotary transformers can only pass AC, not DC, power and signals. The supporting electronics, including the tape heads or torque sensors, must be designed to accommodate this.

Acoustic tags are commonly used to monitor the behavior of fish. Studies can be conducted in lakes, rivers, tributaries, estuaries or at sea. Acoustic tag technology allows researchers to obtain locational data of tagged fish: depending on tag and receiver array configurations, researchers can receive simple presence/absence data, 2D positional data, or even 3D fish tracks in real-time with sub-meter resolution. Acoustic tags allow researchers to: * Conduct Survival Studies * Monitor Migration/Passage/Trajectory * Track Behavior in Two or Three Dimensions (2D or 3D) * Measure Bypass Effectiveness at Dams and other Passages * Observe Predator/Prey Dynamics Sampling Acoustic Tags transmit a signal made up of acoustic pulses or \\"pings\\" that sends location information about the tagged organism to the hydrophone receiver. By tying the received acoustic signature to the known type of programmed signal code, the specific tagged individual is identified. The transmitted signal can propagate up to 1 km (in freshwater). Receivers can be actively held by a researcher (\\"Active Tracking\\") or affixed to specific locations (\\"Passive Tracking\\"). Arrays of receivers can allow the triangulation of tagged individuals over many kilometers. Acoustic tags can have very long battery life - some tags last up to four years . Tags Examples of acoustic tag sizes Acoustic Tags are produced in many different shapes and sizes depending on the type of species being studied, or the type of environment in which the study is conducted. Sound parameters such as frequency and modulation method are chosen for optimal detectability, and signal level. For oceanic environments, frequencies less than 100 kHz range are often used, while frequencies of several hundreds of kilohertz are more common in for studies in rivers and lakes. A typical Acoustic Tag consists of a piezoceramic transducer, drive/timing electronics, and a battery power source . Cylindrical or “tube” transducers are often used, which have metalization on the inner and outer walls of the structure. In normal operation, an alternating current (AC) electrical signal generated by the drive/timing electronics is impressed across the two metalization layers. This voltage creates stress in the material, which in turn cause the transducer to emit an acoustic signal or “ping”, which emanates outward from the surface of the tube. An acoustic “ping” can be detected by specialized receivers, and processed using advanced signal processing techniques to determine if a fish swimming into the reception area carries a specific acoustic tag. Acoustic Tags are distinguished from other types of devices such as radio tags, or passive inductive transponder (PIT) tags, in that they can work in either salt or freshwater (RF and PIT tags perform poorly in saltwater) and do not depend on steering the fish in a particular path (PIT tags require the fish to be routed through a restricted sensing area). Several different types of methods are used to attach the tag to an organism. In fish, tags are frequently embedded into the individual by cutting a small incision in the abdominal cavity of the fish (surgical implantation), or put down the gullet to embed the Acoustic Tag in the stomach (gastric implantation). External attachment using adhesive compounds is typically not used for fish as scale fluids do not allow for any successful attachment to scale tissue. In other organisms tags are attached with heavy duty glues. Example of post surgical implantation of tag. Receivers Illustration of juvenile salmonid travelling through a fish by-pass intake. Acoustic tag tracking software screen of fish travelling toward a fish bypass intake (side view). By determining the sound's time of arrival at each hydrophone, the 3D position of the fish can be calculated. The hydrophone receiver picks up the sound signal and converts it to data that researchers use to plot the resulting tag positions in three dimensions, in real-time. Using a post processing software, such as MarkTags, takes that data and delivers the end result, the 3D track. Applications Rivers Dams At present, acoustic tags are most commonly used to monitor fish approaching diversion and guidance structures at hydropower dams. This allows hydropowered dam facilities, public utility districts, and municipalities to evaluate specific migration pathways used by the fish (most often salmon smolts), identify where fish mortality occurs and assess fish behavior in relation to hydrodynamic conditions and/or any other environmental parameters. Ultimately, working to improve bypass effectiveness and protect fish populations, Acoustic Tag Tracking Systems are a significant breakthrough in the preservation of migrating salmon populations. For an example of Acoustic Tag Tracking Systems at work on the Columbia River, see Grant County's most recent application or Chelan County's most recent application. Acoustic tags have been employed to help public utility agencies, private firms, and state and federal agencies meet fisheries regulations as defined by the Federal Regulations and Oversight of Energy known as FERC.

Problem statement Formally, the problem takes as input two graphs G1=(V1, E1) and G2=(V2, E2), where the number of vertices in V1 can be assumed to be less than or equal to the number of vertices in V2. G1 is isomorphic to an induced subgraph of G2 if there is an injective function f which maps the vertices of G1 to vertices of G2 such that for all pairs of vertices x, y in V1, edge (x, y) is in E1 if and only if the edge (f(x), f(y)) is in E2. The answer to the decision problem is yes if this function f exists, and no otherwise. This is different from the subgraph isomorphism problem in that the absence of an edge in G1 implies that the corresponding edge in G2 must also be absent. In subgraph isomorphism, these \\"extra\\" edges in G2 may be present. Computational complexity The complexity of induced subgraph isomorphism separates outerplanar graphs from their generalization series-parallel graphs: it may be solved in polynomial time for 2-connected outerplanar graphs, but is NP-complete for 2-connected series-parallel graphs... Special cases The special case of finding a long path as an induced subgraph of a hypercube has been particularly well-studied, and is called the snake-in-the-box problem.. The maximum independent set problem is also an induced subgraph isomorphism problem in which one seeks to find a large independent set as an induced subgraph of a larger graph, and the maximum clique problem is an induced subgraph isomorphism problem in which one seeks to find a large clique graph as an induced subgraph of a larger graph. Differences with the subgraph isomorphism problem Although the induced subgraph isomorphism problem seems only slightly different from the subgraph isomorphism problem, the \\"induced\\" restriction introduces changes large enough that we can witness differences from a computational complexity point of view. For example, the subgraph isomorphism problem is NP-complete on connected proper interval graphs and on connected bipartite permutation graphs, but the induced subgraph isomorphism problem can be solved in polynomial time on these two classes. Moreover, the induced subtree isomorphism problem (i.e. the induced subgraph isomorphism problem where G1 is restricted to be a tree) can be solved in polynomial time on interval graphs, while the subtree isomorphism problem is NP-complete on proper interval graphs.

It became a cult classic, popular since its creation till today, and becoming an important part of the canon of Polish children's literature. History Makuszyński and Walentynowicz created four books: 120 przygód Koziołka Matołka (\\"120 adventures of Koziołek Matołek\\"), Druga księga przygód Koziołka Matołka (\\"second book of adventures of Koziołek Matołek\\"), Trzecia księga przygód Koziołka Matołka (\\"third book of adventures of Koziołek Matołek\\") and Czwarta księga przygód Koziołka Matołka (\\"fourth book of adventures of Koziołek Matołek\\"). Pacanów, the setting of the comic, is a real town in Poland. Once when Makuszyński and Walentynowicz were sitting in a coffee house in Kraków, they spotted a sad looking man sipping a drink at a nearby table. They asked him why he looked so gloomy, and he told them that he came from the small town of Pacanów and was wondering how to help the town prosper. Makuszyński and Walentynowicz decided then to help him by popularizing the small town in their books. Story The stories center around the quest that Matołek, an anthropomorphic goat, undertakes: to find Pacanów, a town where it is rumoured they make shoes for goats. Matołek's adventures are amusing if sometimes surreal. The titular hero is nice, naive, clumsy, laughable and not very bright — in many regards similar to another famous children's story character, Winnie the Pooh by A.A. Milne. As an adventure comic strip the stories are roughly contemporaneous with characters such as Rupert Bear and Tintin and Milou. Matołek's search for Pacanów takes him to many corners of the Earth, from Africa to the Wild West. The stories have visible patriotic undertones, from Matołek's colors (white fur and red shorts, evoking the flag of Poland) to his homesick feelings for Poland, which appear when he finds himself in far-away places. Form The comic has a specific format: each page is divided into regular, rectangular frames with each illustration accompanied by a rhythmical 8-syllabical quatrain. The most popular illustrations come from the third edition, the first two had a different style of art. Influence Statue of Koziołek Matołek in Pacanów. The comic has influenced many generations of Poles, and some of its phrases have penetrated into the Polish language itself, with expressions like 'w Pacanowie kozy kują' (In Pacanów, they shoe goats), 'pacan' and 'matoł' (slowpoke, dummy). From 1969 to 1971 an animated series Dziwne przygody Koziołka Matołka (Strange adventures of Koziołek Matołek) was made by Studio Miniatur Filmowych. The animated version was released in a series on 3 DVDs in 2002 and is available internationally; although there are no English language subtitles, the amount of dialogue is very limited. The original comic book has not been translated. Currently Studio Miniatur Filmowych has started work on a full-length animated film about Koziołek Matołek. There are also four educational games for small children, 'Koziołek Matołek idzie do szkoły' (Koziołek Matołek goes to school), 'Koziołek Matołek wynalazca' (Koziołek Matołek the inventor), 'Szkoła Koziołka Matołka' (The school of Koziołek Matołek) and 'Wesołe przedszkole Koziołka Matołka' (The happy kindergarten of Koziołek Matołek) The series has also been adopted into a theater production for a younger audience.

Andrew Lang included it in The Grey Fairy Book. Synopsis A king and queen had three daughters, and did everything to make them happy. One day, the princesses asked to go on a picnic, and so they did. When they were done eating, the princesses wandered about the garden, but when they stepped across a fence, a dark cloud enveloped them. After a time, the King and Queen called for them, and then searched for them when the girls did not answer their calls. The king proclaimed that whoever brought the princesses back could marry one, and would become the next king. Two generals set out in search, but having spent all their money without finding the princesses, were forced to work as servants to repay an innkeeper for the food and drink he had given them. A royal servant, Bensurdatu, set out, despite the king's unwillingness to lose a faithful servant as well as his daughters and his generals. He found the inn with the generals and paid their debt. The three of them traveled together. In the wilderness, they found a house and begged for a place to stay for the night. The old woman there told them that the king's daughters were taken by a thick cloud, and that two were the prisoners of giants and the third of a serpent with seven heads, all at the bottom of a river. The generals wanted to return home to the King, but Bensurdatu was firm. They went on until they reached the river. The older general insisted on going first, because he was the oldest. They lowered him on a rope, and gave him a bell to ring when he wanted to be pulled back up; he quickly lost his courage and rang it. The second general fared the same. Then they lowered Bensurdatu. He came to a hall where a giant slept, and the princess stood before him. The princess had him hide, and told the giant that he did not smell a man when he stirred from his sleep. She then had Bensurdatu cut off the giant's head. The princess gave Bensurdatu a golden crown. She showed him the door to the next giant, where he killed him as he had killed the first, and the second princess also gave him a golden crown. He went on to the seven-headed serpent; he had to kill it while it was awake, but he took off its heads. Had them lifted up. The youngest wanted Bensurdatu to go before her, fearing the generals' treachery, but he refused; she pledged that she would marry no one else. Then the generals did not lower the rope for him and threatened the princesses, to make them say that they had rescued them. Believing the lie, the king agreed to marry the two oldest to the generals. One morning, Bensurdatu noticed a purse. When he took it down, it asked him what demands he had for his rescue. He had it bring him to the surface and give him a ship. He sailed to the king's city. The king wanted to marry him to his youngest daughter, but she refused. He asked if she would say the same if he were Bensurdatu. She said nothing, and he told his story. The king exiled the generals and married Bensurdatu to his youngest daughter.

An early associate of Russell Simmons and Larry Smith, Dave first made his name in the 1980s. Early life Born in The Bronx borough of New York City on October 3, 1960, Davy was 10 years old when he moved with his family to Hollis, Queens, a largely African-American community notable as the home of such world-class achievers as Andrew Young, the Rev. Al Sharpton, Lani Guinier, Milt Jackson, Run-DMC and DJ Hurricane. Of his musical education, Dave has said, \\"I always liked the Jackson 5 when I was young, so I got a guitar and taught myself how to play.\\"City Limits magazine, December 1985. Eventually, he also taught himself how to play bass, keyboards, and drums. At the dawn of hip-hop in the mid-Seventies, Dave taught himself how to deejay. He formed a local rap group in Hollis named Solo Sounds, which included DJ Hurricane and others. Davy produced songs for Run-DMC, The Fat Boys, Kurtis Blow, Spoonie Gee, Jimmy Spicer, The Afros and The Fearless Four. In 1979, Dave began touring as the DJ for Kurtis Blow, who was managed by Hollis native Russell Simmons. The gig with Blow, which Dave performed through 1983, included a handful of dates in September 1980 on a bill with The Commodores and Bob Marley at Madison Square Garden.Paine, Jake, \\"Kurtis Blow Recalls Opening For Bob Marley In Reggae Star’s Last Concerts,\\" Ambrosia For Heads, September 16, 2015, http://ambrosiaforheads.com/2015/09/kurtis-blow-recalls-opening-for-bob- marley-in-reggae-stars-last-concerts-audio/ Career as an artist In 1982 Dave, playing guitar, joined bassist Larry Smith and drummer Trevor Gale in a band called Orange Krush. Their first single, \\"Action,\\" featuring vocals by Alyson Williams, was released that same year. A stark, beat-heavy production, \\"Action\\" was not a hit but proved very influential. In 1983 its basic rhythm was repurposed as the \\"Krush Groove\\" on Run-DMC's \\"Sucker MC's (Krush Groove 1),\\" and again on \\"Hollis Crew (Krush-Groove 2)\\" (1984), \\"Darryl & Joe (Krush- Groove 3)\\" (1985) and \\"Together Forever (Krush-Groove 4)\\" (1985). As of 2016, various parts of \\"Action\\" had been sampled at least 49 times, including on recordings by Jay-Z, Kanye West, Common, De La Soul, and T-Pain. Orange Krush also provided the music for Lovebug Starski's \\"You've Gotta Believe\\" in 1983. Dave debuted as a solo artist late in 1983, cutting \\"One for the Treble (Fresh)\\" as Davy DMX for Aaron Fuchs' Tuff City Records. (Having used the Oberheim DMX drum machine to make the beats for many of his productions, he chose to call himself Davy DMX when it came time to record under his own name.) Primarily a hip-hop instrumental, \\"One for the Treble\\" was reviewed by Eric Schmuckler for The Village Voice in May 1984, who wrote, \\"Davy finds unusual sound fragments to scratch against the beat, like heavily processed voices and the soon-to-be-widely-imitated squealing tires which bring the record to a screeching halt.\\"\\"Sonic Forces,\\" Village Voice, May 15, 1984. Dave's second single for Tuff City, \\"The DMX Will Rock\\" (featuring the rapper Sweet Tee), was released in 1985. Dave's first and only full-length album, Davy's Ride, was released by Def Jam Recordings in 1987. Reviewer Mark Sinker, writing for England's New Musical Express, described Davy as \\"the Hitchcock of hip-hop: sex'n'violence plots are all devices to hang unlikely technical tricks on,\\" adding, \\"[Davy's Ride] is the weirdest, most viciously imaginative LP rap's going to deliver for some time.\\"\\"Davy's Ride,\\" New Musical Express, August 8, 1987. A month earlier, the New York Post's Brian Chin declared that the album constituted \\"more proof that rap is this decade's most accessible pop art.\\"Review, New York Post, July 31, 1987. Career as a producer Dave's work as a session musician, songwriter and producer grew out of his touring gig with Kurtis Blow. He contributed backing vocals to Blow's \\"Hard Times\\" in 1981 and played guitar on \\"Starlife\\" (1981), \\"Tough\\" (1982) and \\"Daydreamin'\\" (also '82). Between 1983 and 1985, Dave was the co-writer of several recordings produced by Blow. These include Sweet G's \\"Games People Play\\" and two tracks by The Fat Boys: \\"Jail House Rap\\" and \\"Hard Core Reggae.\\" In 1983, Dave teamed up with Larry Smith and Russell Simmons to write the music for the rapper Jimmy Spicer's \\"Money (Dollar Bill Y'all).\\" An influential recording, the track had been sampled at least 34 times as of 2016, including in recordings by Wu-Tang Clan, Montell Jordan, Mary J. Blige, and Maino. In 1997, the song was covered by Coolio. Dave's first credit as a producer was on a record by Spoonie Gee, his Tuff City label-mate, in 1983. Entitled \\"The Big Beat,\\" it was followed by \\"Street Girl\\" in 1985, another Davy DMX production. It was also in '85 that Dave produced \\"Transformation\\" for Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde. A year later, Dave teamed up with Spyder-D, another native of Hollis, to produce \\"Don't Make Me Laugh\\" for Sparky D. In '87, Dave wrote the music for Stephanie Mills' \\"Can't Change My Ways,\\" a recording he co-produced with Russell Simmons. Dave's most notable credit as a producer is for Run-DMC's Tougher Than Leather (1988), the platinum-level follow-up to Run-DMC's triple- platinum Raising Hell. He also co-wrote \\"Run's House,\\" \\"Beats to the Rhyme,\\" \\"Radio Station,\\" and \\"How'd You Do It Dee.\\" The following year Dave co- produced several recordings with Jam Master Jay, starting with Run-DMC's \\"Ghostbusters/Pause\\" in 1989, and continuing with \\"Feel It\\" for The Afros in 1990. In 1992 Dave played bass on Public Enemy's \\"Hazy Shade of Criminal.\\" In 1994, he co-produced \\"Back Up Off Me,\\" the title track from the album by Doctor Dre & Ed Lover. Davy D in the 21st Century Since 2010 Davy has been touring with Public Enemy as their lead bass player.

The occupying force starts by establishing a number of small safe areas dispersed over the region. It then pushes out from each area, extending its control and making the areas larger until eventually they join up, leaving only pockets of resistance. The name of the strategy refers to the way ink spots spread on a piece of blotting paper or tissue, starting as tiny scattered points but spreading to cover most or all of the paper. Historically, the inkblot strategy is associated with the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War. More recently, the term has been used in reference to the NATO campaign in Afghanistan and the American-led campaign against the Iraq insurgency.Greg Mills, 'Calibrating Inkspots: Filling Afghanistan's Ungoverned Spaces', RUSI Journal, August 2006, .

It is a follow up on the previous Spinner vehicle. DARPA's technical name for the Crusher is Unmanned Ground Combat Vehicle and Perceptor Integration System, and the whole project is known by the acronym UPI, which stands for Unmanned Ground Combat Vehicle PerceptOR Integration.  Capabilities  The robot can travel over rough terrain, such as vertical walls more than high, wooded slopes, and rocky creekbeds. It can turn 180 degrees in place, raise and lower its suspension by , more than one-half the diameter of the wheels, and lean to the side. The Crusher can carry of combined armor and cargo. According to Stephen Welby, director of DARPA's Tactical Technology Office, \\"This vehicle can go into places where, if you were following in a Humvee, you'd come out with spinal injuries.\\" The Crusher can see enemy troops from over away with its cameras. The Crusher can climb up slopes of more than 40 degrees and travel with more than 30 degrees of slope to the side. When pushed to its maximum speed, the Crusher can travel at , but it can only sustain that speed for less than seven seconds.  Construction  These robots have space frames (made of aluminum and titanium) and skid plates to protect the robot from heavy blows from objects like boulders. The Crusher also has a hybrid engine capable of travelling several miles on one battery charge. The diesel engine then turns on to continue powering the Crusher and to recharge the battery module. This diesel engine comes from a diesel Volkswagen Jetta.  Controls  The Crusher has no driving controls because it is autonomous. Instead, the operators drive the Crusher with video game controllers. While driving between its waypoints via GPS, the Crusher continuously attempts to find the fastest and easiest path to its destination. For example, if it encounters an object more than high or a gorge more than deep, the Crusher will find a way around it. The camera system uses five 1.9 megapixel color cameras, which give an overall field of view of 200 degrees horizontally and 30 degrees vertically at a resolution of over four times that of a normal television set. Currently, the Crusher sends data back to an operator via a long wide fiber optic cable.  Purpose  The Crusher could be used for a number of missions considered highly dangerous for soldiers, such as fire support, reconnaissance, or medevac; as a supply mule; or as a sentry. John Bares, one of the people on the development team for the Crusher, mentions that medevac would be a good use for the robot because it could go into the battlefield under fire to scoop up fallen soldiers. There are no plans to put the Crusher vehicle into service. Instead, it will be used as the base for future unmanned vehicle designs.DARPA’s Crusher Drives Itself, Laughs at Your Puny “Traffic” - Gizmodo.com, March 13, 2012  See also  *Autonomous robot *List of military vehicles *Multifunctional Utility/Logistics and Equipment  References   External links  *Path sampling for the crusher *A brochure with pictures of the crusher Category:Unmanned ground combat vehicles Category:Carnegie Mellon University Category:DARPA Category:Proposed weapons Category:2006 robots Category:Robots of the United States Category:Six-wheeled robots ","title":"Crusher (robot)"},{"id":"6892738","text":"New York State Route 227 (NY 227) is a state highway in the Finger Lakes region of New York in the United States. The highway extends for in a northeast–southwest direction from an intersection with NY 79 south of the hamlet of Reynoldsville in the town of Hector to a junction with NY 96 in the village of Trumansburg. In between, NY 227 intersects NY 228 in Perry City by the east town line of Hector and passes through the town of Ulysses. Part of NY 227 straddles the Schuyler–Tompkins county line. When NY 227 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, it extended from just east of Watkins Glen to Perry City. The route was extended northward to Trumansburg in the early 1940s, replacing part of NY 79; however, it was replaced by NY 79 from Watkins Glen to Reynoldsville in the early 1960s. Prior to 1930, the sections of NY 227 near Reynoldsville and north of Perry City were part of Route 46, an unsigned legislative route. Route description NY 227 is signed as east-west at its terminus with NY 79 and north-south at its terminus with NY 96\\\\. NY 227 east at Perry City, where the route intersects CR 3 and the northern terminus of NY 228 NY 227 begins at a fork off NY 79 in the town of Hector. The route bends northward, passing the eastern extremities of Finger Lakes National Forest before turning eastward into the hamlet of Reynoldsville. It serves as the main east-west road through Reynoldsville, remaining two lanes wide as it runs through the small community. After leaving the hamlet, the route keeps its gradual northeastern progression, running parallel with the nearby Updyke Road, which forks off toward NY 228\\\\. Not far from the junction, NY 227 bends eastward for a short distance near a farm, the first in a series of eastward and northeastward turns over the next . It finally heads due east into the hamlet of Perry City, where it passes some houses ahead of the northern terminus of NY 228\\\\. At this intersection, NY 227 turns to the north on NY 228's right-of-way while NY 227's alignment continues eastward as County Route 3 (CR 3), a short connector to CR 142 at the nearby Tompkins County line. Continuing north from Perry City, NY 227 straddles the Schuyler-Tompkins county line, with the northbound lane in Tompkins County. After , NY 227 turns northeastward, leaving the border and completely entering Tompkins County in the town of Ulysses. Here, directional signage along the route switches from east–west to north–south. The backdrop remains rural for another mile to an intersection with Mayo Road, where the land surrounding the highway begins to become more populated. NY 227 continues its northeastern progression into the village of Trumansburg, initially passing the local golf course and intersecting with the eastern terminus of CR 149 (Searsburg Road). The area around the road becomes primarily residential, a trend that follows the route to its northern end at a junction with NY 96 (West Main Street) in downtown Trumansburg. History In 1911, the New York State Legislature created Route 46, an unsigned legislative route extending from Coopers Plains in Chemung County to Trumansburg in Tompkins County via Watkins Glen. East of Watkins Glen, Route 46 proceeded generally northeastward through Burdett, Reynoldsville and Mecklenburg on its way to Trumansburg. On March 1, 1921, the Route 46 designation was reassigned to another highway in Allegany and Steuben counties as part of a partial renumbering of the legislative route system. The segment of pre-1921 Route 46 that ran alongside Seneca Lake became part of NY 78 ; however, the remainder of old Route 46 between Watkins Glen and Trumansburg went unnumbered until 1930. NY 78 was replaced by NY 44 (now NY 414) in the vicinity of Watkins Glen as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the same time, two parts of the pre-1921 routing of Route 46 east of Seneca Lake were assigned posted route numbers for the first time. From just northeast of Watkins Glen to Reynoldsville, the old road became part of NY 227, which initially extended from NY 44 (now NY 414) near Watkins Glen to NY 79 in Perry City. While Route 46 veered southeast from Reynoldsville to serve Mecklenburg, NY 227 proceeded northeast from the former to connect to Perry City. The portion of old Route 46 north of Perry City became part of NY 79. NY 227 was extended north to Trumansburg in the early 1940s, replacing NY 79, which was truncated south to its junction with NY 227 in Perry City. NY 79 was rerouted west of Mecklenburg in the early 1960s to end at NY 414 near Watkins Glen. The realignment supplanted NY 227 from Watkins Glen to Reynoldsville and utilized the old Route 46 corridor from there to Mecklenburg. NY 227 was truncated to its junction with NY 79 south of Reynoldsville at this time.

The team, formed from the merger of the Hawke's Bay and Manawatu unions, featured current and future All Blacks and a former All Black in coach Frank Oliver. It came second in its division in 1997, and first in 1998, and would have progressed to the first division. However, following financial trouble it split back into the two separate unions. Reviving the Central Vikings as a Super Rugby team was floated in 2016, but this did not occur. History The Central Vikings Rugby Union was founded in December 1996 with the merger of the Hawke's Bay and Manawatu unions. The Vikings were formed with the hopes of lifting themselves out of the 2nd division and to be competitive in the 1st division. The Central Vikings had two All Blacks in the team which included Bull Allen and Christian Cullen as well as featuring various Super 12 players such as Chiefs star Mark Ranby who later became an All Black himself. The Central Vikings finished 2nd in 1997 when they were beaten 63–10 by Northland but even if they had won, they weren't allowed to progress into the 1st division. They finished 1st in 1998 when they beat the then Nelson Bays team, now part of Tasman Makos. They were subsequently allowed to progress to the 1st division. The Vikings however got into financial trouble and they split back to Hawke's Bay and Manawatu for the 1999 season. The Vikings were largely hindered in their second season after not only losing All Black legend Christian Cullen but also losing the then All Blacks Coach John Hart after Hart was advised he could not coach NPC, Super Rugby and All Black teams at the same time. Despite of these disadvantages the Vikings went on to win the second division and were picked to be a major force in the first division before financial problems prevented them from advancing and ultimately caused the end of the Vikings. With the announcement that New Zealand might receive a 6th Super Franchise in the SANZAR Super Rugby competition beginning 2016, the Hawke's Bay union announced its interest in forming this franchise together with Manawatu, effectively resurrecting the Central Vikings brand as a Super Rugby franchise. This never came to fruition and instead the Super Rugby added the South African Southern Kings, the Argentinan Jaguares and the Japanese Sunwolves. Controversy In December 1997 a special meeting of the Hawke's Bay Rugby Football Union was held to decide the future of the Central Vikings Rugby Union. Eight of the Hawke's Bay Union's 21 clubs called the meeting to seek agreement for Hawke's Bay to withdraw from the Vikings. A vote on a resolution calling for Hawke's Bay to withdraw from the combined Hawke's Bay–Manawatu team was lost, 7–12, in a secret ballot. Once the resolution was lost, HBRFU president Tom Mulligan said there was no reason for the meeting to continue. The Vikings were then given the all-clear to continue as an NPC second division rugby team.

It is at an elevation of 1335 ft (407 m) above sea level. History The area gained its name as the estate of Dr. Charles Edgar Welch (hence Ch-ed-wel), youngest son of Dr. Thomas Bramwell Welch, who pioneered the development of unfermented grape juice as a drink. Charles Edgar, who shared his father's profession of dentistry, became involved in the grape juice enterprise as a young man, and began to run the Vineland, NJ, business independently in 1875. Within two decades, he founded the Welch's Grape Juice Company, and in 1897 relocated it to Westfield, NY, on the shores of Lake Erie just a few miles northwest of the tip of Chautauqua Lake. The estate at Chedwel included two main houses built by the Welchs, with adjacent cottages for guests, a tennis court, and a croquet court. Charles Edgar Welch was, among other things, six times mayor of Westfield, a New York State gubernatorial candidate in 1916, and a trustee of Chautauqua Institution, located directly across the lake from Chedwel. The property was parceled and sold by the mid-twentieth century. The community presently includes, besides the former Welch domiciles, several other homes built along its two streets, Chedwel Road and Overlook Avenue. One of the original buildings was a large log cabin. The interior of the cabin, including the accessories, was built entirely from logs and branches of trees. The beds, light fixtures, towel racks, door openers, even the toilet paper holders, are made from logs and tree branches. These pieces were gathered by the brother of Elbert Hubbard, of Roycroft fame, who spent untold hours walking through the woods looking for branches of just the right shape for various purposes in the cabin.

They agreed to a 20-year truce and had accepted the Dnieper River as the demarcation line between the Ottoman Empire and Moscow's domain. All sides agreed not to settle the territory between the Southern Bug and Dnieper rivers. After the signing of the treaty, the Nogai hordes still retained the right to live as nomads in the southern steppes of Ukraine, while the Cossacks retained the right to fish in the Dnieper and its tributaries; to obtain salt in the south; and to sail on the Dnieper and the Black Sea. The Ottoman sultan then recognized Muscovy's sovereignty in the Left-bank Ukraine region and the Zaporozhian Cossack domain, while the southern part of the Kiev region, the Bratslav region, and Podolia were left under Ottoman control.

Recorded live in the CBN studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia, the album was produced by Paul Mills, and includes the vocals by Lenny LeBlanc and guitar by Chris Rodriguez. The album also includes narrations that contain Bible verses. The video and the DVD are the same recording of this album. { class= + Product ID Number - ! Title !! CD !! Tape !! Video !! DVD !!

I Will Sing  17822  17824  17823  20121  17821 } Conception Moen's preceding albums have been recorded in front of large audiences, particularly God Is Good – Worship with Don Moen, which was recorded with an audience of 7000 worshippers. However, for I Will Sing, Moen decided to record an album with only a small number of worshippers. Speaking on this, he said, > You hear a lot about mega-churches, but most people worship in small > churches. My heart goes out to music directors who hear our CDs and think, > \\"That sounds great, but we've got 85 people in our church.\\" Moen thus decided to record an album to encourage other worship leaders to lead worship in front of small audiences.I Will Sing was recorded with only 70 local worshippers. Moen described the experience as being the \\"second most powerful worship experience [he had] ever had\\". Song inspiration The title track of the album, I Will Sing, was written by Moen. It was written while Moen was in his car at one of Alabama's gulf coast beaches, trying to write songs for his upcoming album. He had been having a frustrating day, and the lyrics he wrote demonstrated his feelings. However, he did not like the lyrics. He said, > I didn't feel anything the entire day. It was one of those times when you > wonder where God is. I was driving back home, feeling frustrated, and I > said, \\"Lord, You seem so far away, a million miles or more it feels today.\\" > It just popped out. Then I got another line: \\"And though I haven't lost my > faith, I must confess right now that it's hard for me to pray.\\" The words > kept coming, and I wrote the entire song right there in my car, but I didn't > like it. I thought, \\"What a waste! I need songs for the album; I don't need > this!\\" Moen did not plan to use the song, thinking that he would \\"never put it on a Hosanna! Music album\\". Later, he found out about the death of David C. Reilly's daughter. Reilly had been designing album covers for Integrity Music for more than a decade. Moen then recorded the song on a CD and sent it to David, with an encouragement. The note he attached to Reilly said, > I know you're going to have days when you feel like, \\"Where in the world is > God?\\" but I want to encourage you to sing. Don't give up. It was then that Moen discovered the value of the song, realizing that God wanted his people to be \\"honest before the Lord\\".

The Program is the largest international scholarship program for undergraduates in the world, and the Davis family's contributions to the United World Colleges (UWC) movement are the largest ever made by a single donor to international education.1 Shelby Davis, the scholarship's namesake, is an investor whose largest fund, Davis New York Venture, was named to the Forbes Honour Roll for mutual fund investments; he is the son of Shelby Cullom Davis. Davis co-founded the scholarship program in 2000 along with Phil Geier, former President of UWC- USA. Once UWC graduates enrol in one of the Program's partner U.S. colleges or universities, the Program provides financial support for their undergraduate educations through institutional grants that support need-based scholarships. Originally, the scholarship was offered to students matriculating at one of five colleges in the United States: the College of the Atlantic, Middlebury College, Colby College, Wellesley College and Princeton University. The network of eligible universities has since grown to 95. The scholarship is unusual as it is restricted to students who have already faced heavy competition, in their penultimate year of high school, to be accepted to, and to complete the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme at, one of the 18 schools or colleges in the United World Colleges (UWC) movement. UWC is an educational movement including 18 sixth form colleges (upper-level secondary schools) and full schools located throughout the world that educate international students from 160 countries, with a focus on peace and sustainability.

This was a period in which the Church took a strong stance against human rights abuses by numerous military juntas; it also expressed a preference for the poor and concerns about extreme poverty and wealth inequality. Before he turned 80 on December 19, 1993, Juan Landázuri Ricketts was the last Cardinal elevated by Pope John XXIII to retain voting rights in a papal conclave. Early life Born as Guillermo Eduardo Landázuri Ricketts in 1913 in Arequipa, Peru, he was educated in Catholic schools. He joined the Order of Friars Minor in 1937 (taking the name Juan) and became a priest two years later. His ability as a priest was immediately noticed, and he was appointed as secretary to the general delegation of his order as early as 1943. After finishing his theological studies in 1949, Landázuri Ricketts served briefly a faculty member of the Franciscan Theological Seminary in Puerto Ocopa. His status within the wider Church was rising rapidly, and he was selected as the general definitor of the Order of Friars Minor by 1951. Archbishop of Lima The following year, Landázuri Ricketts was appointed titular bishop of Roina and was chosen in 1955 to replace the deceased Juan Gualberto Guevara as Archbishop of Lima. His appointment coincided with a radically modernising military dictatorship under Manuel Odria. Efforts at such reform were repeated until 1980. As Archbishop, he collaborated with these efforts for sweeping agricultural and institutional reforms to take Peru into the modern world and develop its great economic potential. He believed that these would improve social conditions in the country. By 1962 he had been selected as Primate of Peru and was made a Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Aracoeli by Pope John XXIII in June 1962. He made great efforts, aided by the Jesuits in Peru, to consolidate the vast archives of the Lima Archdiocese. These had accumulated since Spanish colonisation of Latin America and were invaluable sources of the history of the region. Liberation theology In the following period Landázuri Ricketts led during a period when priests rapidly developed liberation theology and a theory of resistance to the military dictatorship under Ricardo Perez Godoy who ruled Peru. Landázuri Ricketts responded to this with considerable support, also trying to ensure that the laity and nuns had considerable say in local decision-making. He became a major participant as Acting President in the 1968 Medellin Conference. He was regularly elected as the leader of local episcopal conference almost without opposition until he reached the age of 75 in 1988. During this period, in accordance with his Franciscan ideals, Landázuri Ricketts left the Archbishop's palace and moved into a small house in a working-class area of Lima. Although he served on the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue during the 1970s, his relationship with the Vatican soured after the ascension of John Paul II. That pope believed that liberation theology posed problems for Catholicism and was too involved in opposition to temporal political systems. Despite being an extremely respected prelate, Landázuri Ricketts had to accept more conservative Opus Dei bishops and sympathisers being appointed in Peru during the 1980s and 1990s. Due to his advancing age, he resigned his role as head of the South American Bishops' conference in 1989. He retired from the see in 1990 and was succeeded by Augusto Vargas Alzamora.

When used in the context of describing an individual it means that such an individual has completed relevant training and passed an exam recognised as meeting RG 146 criteria and is then able to provide advice on financial products to the general public in Australia. All individuals must meet the RG146 requirements before they can sell financial products in Australia to the general public, this includes up-to-date ongoing training through a continuous professional development (CPD) program.  History  Policy Statement 146 (PS146) was introduced under the Financial Services Reform Act 2001 (FSR Act). It prescribes adequate levels of training, competence, and experience for those seen to be giving financial product advice to retail investors. It was part of ASIC's aim to protect so called 'mum & dad' investors. The designation was changed to RG146 by ASIC on 5 July 2007.  Structure  Under RG146 an adviser can be categorised in one of two ways, providing General financial advice or providing Personal financial advice. General financial advice is categorised as Tier 2, and Personal financial advice is categorised as Tier 1. If an adviser is considering an investors personal financial position (i.e. he/she is aware of the investors personal financial position, personal financial aims and needs, and is recommending a product) when recommending a financial product, then that is Tier 1 advice. However, if an adviser is simply talking about the benefits of a product without any personal reference to any client (i.e. he/she may be marketing a new financial product through the media, or a presentation to a group of different investors) then this is categorised as Tier 2 advice. Generally (there are some exceptions to this rule) a Tier 2 adviser will be in a position to sell large quantities of a financial product downstream to Tier 1 advisers. The Tier 1 advisers will then on-sell the product in smaller quantities to his/her clients who he/she believes would have the most to gain from this particular product. For this reason investment banks generally concentrate on having a retail sales team for financial products consisting exclusively of Tier 2 advisers. By doing so, they reduce the number of transactions (because each transaction is of greater worth) and sell their product down-stream much faster. Tier 1 compliance is harder to gain than Tier 2 as it takes into account individual's positions (which by their nature are diverse). Tier 1 requires two examinations, Tier 2 requires one examination. Tier 1 advice is divided into a number of categories that focus on a specific segment of the financial market for example: Managed Investments (see collective investment scheme), Securities, derivatives, Life Insurance, and Superannuation. An adviser can either choose to study these individually or in succession as part of the Diploma of Financial Services (Financial Planning). Whichever the adviser chooses to do they must ensure that they are RG146 compliant for the knowledge area they specialise in. There are many providers of RG146 compliance training in Australia but these have to be registered with ASIC and meet specific criteria.

Biography Vanderwerken was born in 1810 in Waterford, New York. He left home at the age of 17 to become an apprentice to a stagecoach builder in Newark, New Jersey. In 1830, he opened his own coach-building business in Newark, but it went bankrupt during the financial depression of 1837. Vanderwerken relocated to Washington, D.C., between 1848 and 1850 to take personal control of Washington's first successful omnibus line. The Vanderwerken Company line, closely following the horse-drawn coach routes of the early 19th century, traveled from Georgetown to the Navy Yard via M Street and Pennsylvania Avenue for a one-way fare of 12.5 cents. The omnibus, seating twelve passengers, bore the names of persons, historical events, or pictures of other fashionable modes of transportation on the side panels. The stables were located in a former tobacco warehouse at 3222 M Street in Georgetown. The Washington and Georgetown Railroad leased the omnibus line on July 1, 1862, and soon replaced it, donating the vehicles to the Army Medical Department.Report of the president ond directors of the Washington and Georgetown Railroad to the stockholders, July 1863, printed in The Miscellaneous Documents of the Senate of the United States for the First Session Thirty-Eighth Congress, Government Printing Office, 1864, document 11 Living in Washington, D.C., Vanderwerken purchased of Virginia property as pastureland for the horses. About 1852, Vanderwerken improved the farm by having a dwelling erected on \\"a hilltop in a grove of fine oak trees at the northwest corner of Little Falls and Glebe Roads.\\" The dwelling was intended to be used as rental housing and as a summer retreat for the family. On his property, he also established a quarry business, the Potomac Blue Stone Company.Washington City Paper: The City: Cutter's Way The stone blasted from the palisades was used to build Healy Hall of Georgetown University and St. Elizabeths Hospital.John Kelly - Answer Man: This Relic Would've Rocked Your World - washingtonpost.com During the Civil War, the Vanderwerken family remained in Georgetown, having agreed to allow Union General Winfield Scott Hancock use of the house known as Falls Grove as an army hospital. In return, Hancock guaranteed protection of the buildings and fine grove of trees. The General used the two-story carpenter shop as his headquarters. Because of the strategic location of the property, it also became the site of Fort Ethan Allen and Fort Marcy. The property on which Fort Ethan Allen was constructed was returned to the heirs of Gilbert Vanderwerken following the war.http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Arlington/NR_Arlington_FortEthanAllenParkHD_000-5819_text.pdf Fort Ethan Allen was ordered abandoned in the fall of 1865, and soon thereafter was dismantled. Much of what could be salvaged from the fort was sold by the government at public auction. The land under Fort Ethan Allen belonged throughout the war to Vanderwerken. After the war, as partial payment for the use of his land, Vanderwerken was given some of the lumber from the fort. The lumber reportedly was used to build Bellevue, the home of Vanderwerken's daughter and son-in-law, Alfred and Jane Grunwell. Bellevue is located at 3311 N. Glebe Road.

He sang lead on his trademark song, \\"Sexecutioner\\", and \\"Ragnarok\\". There are conflicting origin stories of the Sexecutioner - the Slave Pit Funnies (from 1989–90) suggest that he was summoned in an ancient ritual by Oderus, and was raised from infancy to become Scumdog material. The song \\"Sexecutioner\\" bluntly states that he is from France (hence the French accent). Earlier incarnations of Gwar's website (pre-dating 2004, when the website underwent a drastic overhaul) state that he was from the planet Eros, in the Genital V System, and that even he doesn't know his own age. During his time with the band his stage role was similar to that of a slave, in that he assisted Oderus Urungus in fighting the band's enemies. Unlike the slaves, he was treated as a member of the band (with a similar role as Slymenstra Hymen). Varga, after designing the most frequently seen Sexecutioner mask (the first full head mask for the band), worked with Dave Brockie on Oderus' mask, which has remained largely unchanged since its inception in late 1989. Chuck Varga remains a member of the Slave Pit, the group behind Gwar, though does not work with them (Varga, along with Hunter Jackson, Dave Brockie and Don Drakulich were the founders of Slave Pit). He retired from touring in 1995 (Varga was the oldest member of Slave Pit Inc., and touring became physically stressful, especially on his knees), but worked part-time until 2001. For a number of years following his departure, he worked with Don Drakulich (Sleazy P. Martini), who had also retired from touring, in a special effects company. According to Drakulich (who answered this question on Bohab Central, a prominent Gwar fansite, on January 13, 2007), the term \\"bohab\\" was, in part, invented by Varga - initially, it was a nickname for a socially inept friend of Hunter Jackson's (named Bob), invented by Dave Musel; after hearing him say this (he was in the room when this happened), \\"He instantly shortened it by getting rid of the Slohab then coined as part of the Slave-Pit lexicon to refer to anyone who is socially awkward, who drones on about trivial matters while boring all those around him. In particular it refers to those who are tedious talkers who refuse to let bored body language and avoidance by others stop their persistently friendly overtures - now known as bohabery. Bohabs are not losers who chose to be loners. Bohabs are losers who are persistently friendly.\\"http://www.bohabcentral.com/hall/asksleazy/index.php?a=answers&d;=200701&id;=141 According to GWAR's website, The Sexecutioner was to return for the 2012 GWARBQ. It was unknown if this marked a permanent return of the character, or if he would be portrayed by Varga. The Sexecutioner did appear at the fifth GWARBQ after the death of Dave Brockie, taking vocals of one song, \\"Sexecutioner\\". It is currently unclear how permanent this return is.

Its route is contained within portions of Marion, Chattahoochee, and Talbot counties. The northern segment was originally part of SR 267 and was built around 1950. By 1963, SR 355 was built along its current alignment, including the former section of SR 267\\\\. Route description SR 355 begins at an intersection with SR 26 northwest of Glen Alta in southwestern Marion County. This intersection is just to the southeast of Fort Benning. It travels to the north, through Glen Alta, and curves to the northwest. It cuts across the southeastern corner of the base, where it travels through a brief portion of the base and Chattahoochee County, and intersects SR 137\\\\. The two routes share a brief concurrency, until they leave the base. SR 355 splits off to the northeast and intersects the northern terminus of SR 137 Spur (Old Columbus Road). The route continues winding its way to the north and intersects the northern terminus of SR 352\\\\. Just before entering Talbot County, it intersects the northern terminus of SR 267 and passes through Juniper. In Talbot County, SR 355 passes just to the west of Meadows Lake. Then, it crosses over a Norfolk Southern Railway line. It passes just to the west of Benson Lake and meets its northern terminus, an intersection with US 80/SR 22/SR 540 north of Juniper. SR 355 is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. History The roadway that would eventually become SR 355 was built between 1949 and 1951. This roadway was part of SR 267 and included all of modern-day SR 355 from the current SR 267 intersection south of Juniper north to SR 355's northern terminus. Between 1957 and 1960, this entire roadway was paved. Between 1960 and 1963, SR 355 was built from its current southern terminus to the current SR 267 intersection. It was also designated along the former part of SR 267 north of there. In addition, SR 355 Loop was established along the Marion–Talbot county line. By 1966, all of SR 355 was paved. Major intersections Loop route State Route 355 Loop (SR 355 Loop) was a loop route of SR 355 that existed along the Marion–Talbot county line, in the west-central part of the U.S. state of Georgia. It was essentially a bypass of Juniper. It began at an intersection with the SR 355 mainline just southwest of Juniper, in Marion County. It followed Juniper Lane to the north-northeast over the Upatoi Creek, where it crossed into Talbot County, to the intersection with Juniper Mill Pond Road. It then followed that road until it met its northern terminus, another intersection with the SR 355 mainline, north-northeast of Juniper SR 355 Loop was built, and paved, between 1960 and 1963 and coincided with the designation of the SR 355 mainline.

Diamond proportions and facets, for the round brilliant cut During the 14th century, after the adoption of the table cut, a further facet was added to the bottom of the cut parallel to the surface of the table. The term used for these bottom facets derives from the Latin word for bottom, culus. The culet is added largely to protect the integrity of the gemstone. On a diamond, the cleavage plane runs parallel to the octahedral faces, and so any damage to the tip of the diamond could cause a split up the entire length of the pavilion. With other gemstones that are not subject to cleavage, the culet is added to protect the fragility of the pointed tip. The culet has remained optional on many diamond cuts up to the present day, and was omitted from Marcel Tolkowsky's original designs for the round brilliant diamond cut in 1919. Nonetheless, culet facets are common on modern brilliant-cut diamonds.

He was born in Concepción, the son of Juan Manuel Vidaurre Ugalde de la Concha and Isabel Garretón. In 1813, at the age of 15, he joined the Chilean militia and fought in the Chilean War of Independence as a private, under General Juan Gregorio de las Heras. His bravery helped him win fast promotion, and by 1817 he was already a full captain. He participated in the Battles of Talcahuano and Cancha Rayada, and finally at Maipú in 1818. He married Valentina Palma and they had four children: Filemón, Emilio, Josefa and Isabel. By 1820 he was a member of the Chilean Army General Staff. As such he participated in the campaigns to capture Chiloé, where he was promoted to Sergeant Major. In 1830, after participating in the battles of Osorno and Lircay, he was promoted to colonel. Notwithstanding his brilliant military career, he was several times involved in mutinies against his superiors. In 1823, he participated of a rebellion against General José Joaquín Prieto in Rancagua. In 1828 he joined the rebellion against President Francisco Antonio Pinto. He was notorious as a person who held changing political ideas, being very fond of public opinion and easily suggestionable by his friends. On June 3, 1837 he led a rebellion against the government of President José Joaquín Prieto and in opposition to Chilean participation in the War of the Confederation. On that day, while commander of the Maipo regiment, he captured and imprisoned minister Diego Portales while he was reviewing troops at the army barracks in Quillota. Vidaurre immediately proceeded to attack Valparaíso on the mistaken belief that public opinion opposed to the war would support him and topple the government. He was defeated at the Battle of Barón, on June 6, and subsequently had minister Portales assassinated by his guardians. He was captured four months later, court-martialed and sentenced to death. He was publicly executed on Orrego square in Valparaiso, in 1837.

In collaboration with members, APHL advances laboratory systems and practices, and promotes policies that support healthy communities. APHL serves as a liaison between laboratories and federal and international agencies, and ensures that the network of laboratories has current and consistent scientific information in order to be ready for outbreaks and other public health emergencies. Membership consists of local, territorial, county and state public health laboratories; environmental, agricultural and veterinary laboratories; and corporations and individuals with an interest in public health and laboratory science. APHL is a non- profit, 501(c)(3) organization with a history of over fifty years. History *1899 American Public Health Association formed the Committee of Laboratories *1921 Southern Public Health Laboratory Association (SPHLA) formed *1927 SPHLA became State Laboratory Directors Conference and opened membership to other states *1939 SPHLA changed its name to Conference of State and Provincial Laboratory Directors *1951 Association of State and Territorial Public Health Laboratory Directors founded *1998 Renamed the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) and became a more inclusive organization with new membership categories Public health laboratories Public health laboratories operate as a first line of defense to protect the public against diseases and other health hazards, ranging from testing of water, food, dairy and environmental products to investigation of newly emerging infectious diseases. Working in collaboration with other arms of the nation’s public health system, public health laboratories provide clinical diagnostic testing, disease surveillance, newborn screening, environmental and radiological testing, emergency response support, outbreak detection, applied research, laboratory training and other essential services to the communities they serve. Public health laboratory scientists are highly educated specialists with knowledge of one or more scientific disciplines, advanced skills in laboratory practice and the ability to apply this expertise to the detection and solution of complex problems affecting human health. Every US state and territory, and the District of Columbia, has a central governmental public health laboratory that performs testing and other laboratory services on behalf of the entire jurisdiction. In addition, some states have local public health laboratories ranging in size from large metropolitan laboratories with over a hundred scientists to small rural laboratories with one or two staff that support local public health. Examples of testing performed by public health laboratories include testing drinking and recreational water, food safety testing, testing for lead exposure in children, screening newborns for genetic and metabolic disorders, rabies testing and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Many state public health laboratories also perform environmental testing. In some states, the environmental and public health laboratory are the same laboratory and are often within the state health department. In other states, the environmental laboratory is separate from the public health lab and is part of the department of environmental quality or natural resources while the public health laboratory is part of the health department. Similarly, testing for food safety may take place in the public health laboratory or in a food lab within the department of agriculture. With global food sourcing, each year sees new outbreaks take headlines (e.g., E. coli in lettuce, Salmonella in peanut butter), and the laboratory is a critical link in the chain of detection that helps to quickly identify the source of the outbreak and facilitate recall of unsafe consumable products. Programs Through its programs, APHL advances the excellence of public health laboratories. Environmental health APHL’s Environmental Health Program focuses on the role of the laboratory in detecting the presence of contaminants – both in people and in our environment. Environmental laboratories conduct regular testing of water, air, soil, food and other media to ensure that populations are not being exposed to unhealthy levels of contamination. APHL works to raise awareness of environmental health issues; to inform public policies that help the nation detect, reduce and prepare for environmental threats; and improve environmental health laboratory practice. The association serves as a liaison between member laboratories and federal agencies, including Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Center for Environmental Health and the US Environmental Protection Agency. Food safety Public health laboratory surveillance of foodborne disease detects outbreaks limits the spread of illness. APHL’s Food Safety Program promotes the role of state and local public health laboratories and agricultural laboratories in the detection, testing and surveillance of foodborne pathogens. The program collaborates with partners at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Department of Agriculture- Food Safety Inspection Service, the Food and Drug Administration and related organizations. The program also works closely with CDC’s Division of Foodborne, Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases to support state and local laboratories in Pulsenet, the national network of public health laboratories, food laboratories and regulatory agencies coordinated by the CDC that recognizes and identifies foodborne outbreaks as soon as possible. APHL is likewise an active member of the Council to Improve Foodborne Outbreak Response (CIFOR), which integrates local, state and federal efforts across many food safety disciplines to reduce the burden of foodborne illness in the United States. They also sit on the Advisory Council for the International Food Protection Training Institute. Global health APHL’s Global Health Program assists resource-limited countries to strengthen their national laboratory systems. The program also builds connections across regional and national laboratory systems to foster cross-border collaboration. APHL’s Global Health Program offers a full range of technical assistance services, including development of laboratory networks, design and presentation of lab training programs, planning and management of lab renovation projects, planning and implementation of laboratory information management systems, procurement of equipment and supplies, and US-based advanced training for senior laboratory professionals. The program has significant experience with developing national strategic plans for public health laboratories, developing laboratory quality assurance programs, and implementing quality testing programs such as drug susceptibility testing for tuberculosis and CD4 lymphocyte testing. Infectious diseases APHL’s Infectious Diseases Program promotes the role of the laboratory in disease detection and surveillance, and works to expand and enhance relationships among member laboratories, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, other federal and state agencies, associations and academia involved in relevant public health activities, including laboratory testing, policy and training. The Infectious Diseases Programs leads APHL’s efforts on HIV, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, and influenza. When new infectious diseases emerge, like the 2009 spread of H1N1, APHL supports crisis response by facilitating rapid transfer of credible information, and technical guidance from federal agencies to state and local laboratories. On January 20,2020 APHL established an incident in Wuhan China calling it 2019-n-Cov. Scott J. Becker, Executive Director of APHL compared it to SARS, MERS, H5N1 Bird Flu. The lab started concepts also on EUA in the event that the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, should declare a public health emergency. Informatics APHL is a leader in the movement to transform the transmission of health information from paper to electronic data. In tandem with its partners, APHL works to build a secure, nationwide health information infrastructure. One effort by the Informatics program is PHLIP, the Public Health Laboratory Interoperability Project. PHLIP aims to establish reliable laboratory data exchange between state public health laboratories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by fostering collaboration in IT and laboratory science. Laboratory systems and standards APHL works with partners to build the foundation for quality testing, comprehensive standards and integrated public health laboratory systems. One of the initiatives, the Laboratory System Improvement Program, provides individual assessments of public health laboratory systems that include engage stakeholders for system improvement, performance, implementation of strategies and continual evaluation. APHL also collaborates on the National Laboratory System project to build a public-private network of laboratories nationwide. Newborn screening and genetics APHL’s Newborn Screening and Genetics in Public Health Program strengthens the role of public health laboratories in genetics testing and designs strategies to address changes in the newborn screening testing field. The program proactively develops and recommends position statements related to newborn screening and genetics to the association. The program also provides input to the Newborn Screening Quality Assurance Program on quality control and proficiency testing issues relevant to newborn screening laboratories across the globe. The program interacts with state, federal and association partners in implementing national recommendations on newborn screening and genetics testing by participating on national and federal committees. Public health preparedness and response APHL promotes the critical role of public health laboratories in detecting and responding to all health emergencies. It sponsors training to increase the competency of preparedness staff, advocates for resources to sustain key programs and builds partnerships for a stronger public health system. Public Health Preparedness and Response works closely with federal partners at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Homeland Security, the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies. Research APHL monitors trends in public health laboratory diagnostics, personnel and infrastructure. It uses this data to benchmark against national norms and to define issues of importance to lab practice and policy. APHL also disseminates research findings via issue briefs and communications with federal decision makers, health partners and the laboratory community. Members have access to survey data online, enabling them to leverage this information quickly to identify promising strategies and practices. Laboratory education and training Laboratory training APHL offers a range of training to strengthen the skills of all laboratorians and promote excellence in laboratory practice. APHL sponsors education programs both independently and through the National Laboratory Training Network (NLTN), a training system sponsored by APHL and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the continuing education courses offer laboratory continuing education credits to laboratorians. The participants are from public health laboratories, hospital laboratories, public agencies, reference laboratories, academic centers and other healthcare institutions. Courses focus on priority topics of public health significance, such as hands-on training on molecular techniques, emerging infectious disease detection and laboratory biosafety/biosecurity. APHL routinely partners with other organizations, such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, to facilitate training. Leadership and workforce development APHL directs the National Center for Public Health Laboratory Leadership, a resource designed to develop leaders and expand knowledge of public health laboratory management. The Center also collaborates with other associations, academic institutions and federal partners to provide information about careers in public health laboratory science to middle and high school students and to support career fairs for college students. In addition, the association also manages fellowship and traineeship programs that prepare laboratory scientists for a career in public health and advance the skills of mid-level professionals. Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) Fellowship Program The Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) Laboratory Fellowship program prepares laboratory scientists for careers in public health. The two-track program (for bachelor’s-/master’s-level and postdoctoral-level scientists) emphasizes the practical application of technologies, methodologies and practices related to emerging infectious diseases. Qualified candidates learn to support public health initiatives and conduct high priority infectious disease research in local, state and federal (CDC) public health laboratories. Fellows receive a stipend, individual medical insurance and a professional development allowance. This program is co-sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Public policy APHL works to safeguard the public's health through advocacy for state public health laboratories and their federal partners. The association provides expert testimony, guidance on legislative proposals and comments on federal rulemaking. APHL connects US public health laboratories with federal agencies, serving as a conduit for exchange of information. It also advises agencies on development and implementation of national health initiatives. Additionally, APHL researches and responds to inquiries, represents members at national forums and provides guidance on federal protocols and directives. Corporate relations APHL liaises with industry sectors and coordinates ad hoc public-private partnerships. For example, APHL has coordinated emergency placement of diagnostic equipment in public health laboratories. In addition, it supports industry research and development to advance public health science by providing forums for discussion between corporate and laboratory leaders.

The folding funnel hypothesis is a specific version of the energy landscape theory of protein folding, which assumes that a protein's native state corresponds to its free energy minimum under the solution conditions usually encountered in cells. Although energy landscapes may be \\"rough\\", with many non-native local minima in which partially folded proteins can become trapped, the folding funnel hypothesis assumes that the native state is a deep free energy minimum with steep walls, corresponding to a single well-defined tertiary structure. The term was introduced by Ken A. Dill in a 1987 article discussing the stabilities of globular proteins. The folding funnel hypothesis is closely related to the hydrophobic collapse hypothesis, under which the driving force for protein folding is the stabilization associated with the sequestration of hydrophobic amino acid side chains in the interior of the folded protein. This allows the water solvent to maximize its entropy, lowering the total free energy. On the side of the protein, free energy is further lowered by favorable energetic contacts: isolation of electrostatically charged side chains on the solvent-accessible protein surface and neutralization of salt bridges within the protein's core. The molten globule state predicted by the folding funnel theory as an ensemble of folding intermediates thus corresponds to a protein in which hydrophobic collapse has occurred but many native contacts, or close residue-residue interactions represented in the native state, have yet to form. In the canonical depiction of the folding funnel, the depth of the well represents the energetic stabilization of the native state versus the denatured state, and the width of the well represents the conformational entropy of the system. The surface outside the well is shown as relatively flat to represent the heterogeneity of the random coil state. The theory's name derives from an analogy between the shape of the well and a physical funnel, in which dispersed liquid is concentrated into a single narrow area.  Background  The protein folding problem is concerned with three questions, as stated by Ken A. Dill and Justin L. MacCallum: (i) How can an amino acid sequence determine the 3D native structure of a protein? (ii) How can a protein fold so quickly despite a vast number of possible conformations (the Levinthal's Paradox)? How does the protein know what conformations not to search? And (iii) is it possible to create a computer algorithm to predict a protein's native structure based on its amino acid sequence alone? Auxiliary factors inside the living cell such as folding catalysts and chaperones assist in the folding process but do not determine the native structure of a protein. Studies during the 1980s focused on models that could explain the shape of the energy landscape, a mathematical function that describes the free energy of a protein as a function of the microscopic degrees of freedom. After introducing the term in 1987, Ken A. Dill surveyed the polymer theory in protein folding, in which it addresses two puzzles, the first one being the Blind Watchmaker's Paradox in which biological proteins could not originate from random sequences, and the second one being Levinthal's Paradox that protein folding cannot happen randomly. Dill pulled the idea from the Blind Watchmaker into his metaphor for protein folding kinetics. The native state of protein can be achieved through a folding process involving some small bias and random choices to speed up the search time. That would mean even residues at very different positions in the amino acid sequence will be able to come into contact with each other. Yet, a bias during the folding process can change the folding time by tens to hundreds of orders of magnitude. As protein folding process goes through a stochastic search of conformations before reaching its final destination, the vast number of possible conformations is considered irrelevant, while the kinetic traps begin to play a role. The stochastic idea of protein intermediate conformations reveals the concept of an “energy landscape” or \\"folding funnel\\" in which folding properties are related to free energy and that the accessible conformations of a protein are reduced as it approaches native-like structure. The y-axis of the funnel represents the \\"internal free energy\\" of a protein: the sum of hydrogen bonds, ion-pairs, torsion angle energies, hydrophobic and salvation free energies. The many x-axes represent the conformational structures, and those that are geometrically similar to each other are close to one another in the energy landscape. The folding funnel theory is also supported by Peter G Wolynes, Zaida Luthey-Schulten and Jose Onuchic, that folding kinetics should be considered as progressive organization of partially folded structures into an ensemble (a funnel), rather than a serial linear pathway of intermediates. Native states of proteins are shown to be thermodynamically stable structures that exist in physiological conditions, and are proven in experiments with ribonuclease by Christian B. Anfinsen (see Anfinsen's dogma). It's suggested that because the landscape is encoded by the amino-acid sequence, natural selection has enabled proteins to evolve so that they are able to fold rapidly and efficiently. In a native low-energy structure, there's no competition among conflicting energy contributions, leading to a minimal frustration. This notion of frustration is further measured quantitatively in spin glasses, in which the folding transition temperature Tf is compared to the glass transition temperature Tg. Tf represents the native interactions in the folded structure and Tg represents the strength of non-native interactions in other configurations. A high Tf/Tg ratio indicates a faster folding rate in a protein and fewer intermediates compared to others. In a system with high frustration, mild difference in thermodynamic condition can lead to different kinetic traps and landscape ruggedness.  Proposed Funnel Models   Funnel-shaped Energy Landscape  Golf-course pathway versus rugged golf- course pathway in protein folding kinetics Ken A. Dill and Hue Sun Chan (1997) illustrated a folding pathway design based on Levinthal's Paradox, named the \\"golf-course\\" landscape, where a random searching for the native states would prove impossible, due to the hypothetically \\"flat playing field\\" since the protein \\"ball\\" would take a really long time to find a fall into the native \\"hole\\". However, a rugged pathway deviated from the initial smooth golf-course creates a directed tunnel where the denatured protein goes through to reach its native structure, and there can exist valleys (intermediate states) or hills (transition states) long the pathway to a protein's native state. Yet, this proposed pathway yields a contrast between pathway dependence versus pathway independence, or the Levinthal dichotomy and emphasizes the one- dimensional route of conformation. Another approach to protein folding eliminates the term \\"pathway\\" and replaces with \\"funnels\\" where it's concerned with parallel processes, ensembles and multiple dimensions instead of a sequence of structures a protein has to go through. Thus, an ideal funnel constitutes of a smooth multi-dimensional energy landscape where increasing interchain contacts correlate with decreasing degree of freedom and ultimately achievement of native state. From left to right for proposed funnel-shaped energy landscape: the idealized smooth funnel, the rugged funnel, the Moat funnel, and the Champagne Glass funnel. Unlike an idealized smooth funnel, a rugged funnel demonstrates kinetic traps, energy barriers, and some narrow throughway paths to native state. This also explains an accumulation of misfolded intermediates where kinetic traps prevent protein intermediates from achieving their final conformation. For those that are stuck in this trap, they would have to break away favorable contacts that do not lead to their native state before reaching their original starting point and find another different search downhill. A Moat landscape, on the other hand, illustrates the idea of a variation of routes including an obligatory kinetic trap route that protein chains take to reach their native state. This energy landscape stems from a study by Christopher Dobson and his colleagues about hen egg white lysozyme, in which half of its population undergo normal fast folding, while the other half first forms α-helices domain quickly then β-sheet one slowly. It's different from the rugged landscape since there are no accidental kinetic traps but purposeful ones required for portions of protein to go through before reaching the final state. Both the rugged landscape and the Moat landscape nonetheless present the same concept in which protein configurations might come across kinetic traps during their folding process. On the other hand, the Champagne Glass landscape involves free energy barriers due to conformational entropy that partly resembles the random golf-course pathway in which a protein chain configuration is lost and has to spend time searching for the path downhill. This situation can be applied to a conformational search of polar residues that will eventually connect two hydrophobic clusters.  The Foldon Volcano-shaped Funnel Model  In another study, Rollins and Dill (2014) introduces the Foldon Funnel Model, a new addition to previous folding funnels, in which secondary structures form sequentially along the folding pathway and are stabilized by tertiary interactions. The model predicts that the free energy landscape has a volcano shape instead of a simple funnel that is mentioned previously, in which the outer landscape is sloped uphill because protein secondary structures are unstable. These secondary structures are then stabilized by tertiary interactions, which, despite their increasingly native-like structures, are also increasing in free energy until the second-to-last to the last step that is downhill in free energy. The highest free energy on the volcano landscape is at the step with structure just before the native state. This prediction of energy landscape is consistent with experiments showing that most protein secondary structures are unstable on their own and with measured protein equilibrium cooperativities. Thus, all earlier steps before reaching the native state are in pre-equilibrium. Despite its model being different from other models before, the Foldon Funnel Model still divides conformational space into the two kinetic states: native versus all others.  Application  Folding funnel theory has both qualitative and quantitative application. Visualization of funnels creates a communicating tool between statistical mechanical properties of proteins and their folding kinetics. It suggests the stability of folding process, which would be hard to destroy by mutation given maintained stability. To be more specific, a mutation can occur that leads to blockage of a routes to native state, but another route can take over provided that it reaches the final structure. A protein’s stability increases as it approaches its native state through the partially folded configuration. Local structures such as helices and turns happen first followed by global assembly. Despite a process of trial and error, protein folding can be fast because proteins reach its native structure by this divide-and-conquer, local-to- global process. The idea of folding funnel helps rationalize the purpose of chaperones, in which the re-folding process of a protein can be catalyzed by chaperones pulling it apart and bringing it to a high energy landscape and let it fold again in a random fashion of trials and errors. Funneled landscapes suggest that different individual molecules of the same protein sequence may utilize microscopically different routes to reach the same destination. Some paths will be more populated than others. Funnels distinguish the basics between folding and simple classical chemical reactions analogy. A chemical reaction starts from its reactant A and goes through a change in structure to reach its product B. On the other hand, folding is a transition from disorder to order, not only from structure to structure. Simple one-dimensional reaction pathway does not capture protein folding's reduction in conformational degeneracy. In other words, folding funnels provide a microscopic framework for folding kinetics. Folding kinetics is described by simple mass action models, D-I-N (on-path intermediate I between denatured D and native N) or X-D-N (off-path intermediate X), and is referred to as the macroscopic framework of folding. Sequential Micropath view represents the mass-action model and explains folding kinetics in terms of pathways, transition states, on and off-path intermediates and what one sees in experiments, and is not concerned with the activity of a molecule or the state of a monomer sequence at a specific macroscopic transition state. Its problem is related to Levinthal's Paradox, or the searching problem. In contrast, funnel models aim to explain the kinetics in terms of underlying physical forces, to predict the microstate composition of those macrostates. Nonetheless, it proves challenging for computer simulations (energy landscape) to reconcile the \\"macroscopic\\" view of mass-action models with \\"microscopic\\" understanding of the changes in protein conformation during the folding process. Insights from funnels are not sufficient enough to improve computer search methods. A smooth and funnel-shaped landscape on global scale can appear rough on local scale in computer simulations.

John West (17 January 1809 - 11 December 1873) emigrated from England to Van Diemen's Land in 1838 as a Colonial missionary, and became pastor of an Independent (Congregational) Chapel in Launceston's St. John's Square. He also co-founded The Examiner newspaper in 1842 and was later editor of the Sydney Morning Herald. West was born in England, the son of The Reverend William West and his wife Ann, née Ball. West emigrated to Van Diemen's Land (later renamed Tasmania) in 1839 where he officiated as an Independent minister at Launceston for sixteen years. West attracted half of the members of the Congregational ministry of Charles Price. West's contribution to Launceston and Australian life was great and varied promoting private and charitable enterprise. With James Aikenhead and J. S. Waddell, West founded The Examiner newspaper in 1842. He co-founded the London Agency Association to promote Colonial interests, an Immigration Society, the Mechanics' Institute, City Mission, Public Hospital, General Cemetery, and Cornwall Insurance Company in Launceston and the Hobart Town High School. John West was a leader in the movement seeking the abolition of transportation of convicts to the Australian Colonies. Affronted by the social, economic and moral effects of convictism, he promoted Colonial opposition to transportation from his pulpit and editorials in the Examiner and Hobart's Colonial Times, though historian Babette Smith has exposed West's demagogic rhetoric against convict society. He founded the Launceston Association for the Cessation of Transportation which developed into the first intercolonial political organisation, the Australasian Anti-Transportation League, in Melbourne in 1851. For this occasion he collaborated on the design of the League banner, the precursor to the Australian National Flag. The success of united action against Transportation, which was abolished in 1853, led West to expand his interest in representational government through his essays on Federation, Union of the Colonies, (under the pseudonym John Adams) published locally and in the Sydney Morning Herald during 1854. In 1854 the proprietor of the Sydney Morning Herald, John Fairfax, invited John West to become its first official editor, and West moved to Sydney from where he guided debate on matters of colonial, national and international importance until his sudden death in Woollahra, Sydney, in 1873. His two-volume History of Tasmania, published in 1852, analysed the development of the Colony, the penal system and the condition of the Aboriginal people. Later research disclosed few errors, and West is regarded as one of the founders of Australian historical writing.Green, H.M. (1984), A history of Australian Literature pure and applied , Vol I, 1789-1923, Sydney, Angus & Robertson, p.331.

Biography Davis was born in Aurora, Illinois, and graduated from the Chicago School of Architecture at Armour Institute (later Illinois Institute of Technology). After graduating he began a six-year apprenticeship, part of which was spent as a draftsman for Louis Sullivan—along with another aspiring architect, Frank Lloyd Wright. After his work with Adler and Sullivan, Davis began his career as supervising architect for Armour & Company. Later, in 1900, Davis started an independent firm with his brother Charles. In 1909, he designed the third Kankakee County Courthouse.Kankakee County Bar Association, retrieved 01/10/07 A year later, he was hired by Charles Comiskey to design White Sox Park, later known as Comiskey Park. To prepare for the project, Davis toured ballparks around the country with White Sox pitcher Ed Walsh.Ballparks of Baseball: Comiskey Park, retrieved 01/10/07 In 1914, he was hired by the Chicago Whales to design Weeghman Park, which would later become Wrigley Field. Davis was also involved with the design of the original Yankee Stadium. For most of his career, Davis worked out of his offices in the Unity Building in Chicago's Loop. He lived quietly with his family at his home at 45th and Drexel in Kenwood, Chicago. One architectural historian called Davis \\"one of the most significant lost architects in Chicago.\\" He died in Chicago, aged 74. Davis and his wife, Alma C. Davis, had their first child in 1898. Zachary Taylor Davis II worked as a salesman for Monsanto Company and died of a heart attack on August 11, 1938, at his home in Evanston, Illinois, survived by his wife, Mary (née Ryan) and seven-year-old son, Zachary Taylor Davis III.Chicago Tribune, August 12, 1938 Davis and Alma also had two other sons, David and Lawrence, and a daughter, Mary Louise, who married Charles Allison. Alma died on November 13, 1946, a month before Davis himself. Ballparks Known as the \\"Frank Lloyd Wright of baseball,\\"http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/223437.pdf Davis was one of the first architects to design ballparks with innovative steel-beam and concrete construction.Places of Assembly, by Paula R. Lupkin, Encyclopedia of Chicago, retrieved 01/10/07 Before his design of Comiskey Park, Chicago ballparks were wooden structures with minimal capital investment. This allowed both Chicago teams to move frequently, and also meant that demolition of the old parks was inexpensive. Davis's designs and their more solid construction ended this trend in Chicago. When Comiskey Park needed to be expanded, in part to accommodate fans of the visiting Babe Ruth, Davis oversaw the renovations. He also oversaw expansion of Wrigley Field in 1922.Chicago Tribune, November 9, 1922 Notes External links *Zachary Taylor Davis *Friends of the Windows at St. James Chapel Category:People from Aurora, Illinois Category:Architects from Chicago Category:1872 births Category:1946 deaths Category:Illinois Institute of Technology alumni Category:Architects of Roman Catholic churches ","title":"Zachary Taylor Davis"},{"id":"6893564","text":"Vienna is an unincorporated community about 6 miles from Mississippi in Pickens County, Alabama, United States.

It is the only deer known to be native to Africa, aside from Megaceroides algericus, which went extinct approximately 6,000 years ago. Description A female (hind) at Tierpark Berlin The Barbary stag is smaller than the typical red deer. Its body is dark brown with some white spots on its flanks and back. The antlers lack the bez (second) tine. Range/habitat A herd at Feija National Park The Barbary stag is the only member of the deer family that is native to Africa. It thrives in dense, humid forested areas of Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. It had initially been hunted to extinction in the latter, but specimens from the Tunisian population were reintroduced in the 1990s.Le programme d'espèces d'UICN et la Commission UICN de la sauvegarde des espèces et TRAFFIC. \\"Résumés des Analyses UICN/TRAFFIC des propositions d'amendement aux Annexes de la CITES pour la Quatorzième session de la Conférence des Parties\\", Retrieved on 2008-12-28. One population can be found in Tazekka National Park in the Middle Atlas Mountains.Flora and Fauna - Park National de Tazekka, (official web page of the National Park). Nomenclature Recent genetic studies indicate that the North African red deer population is practically indistinguishable from the Sardinian and Corsican populations, generally referred to as the Corsican red deer. This strongly argues for an ancient introduction of red deer from North Africa to these Mediterranean islands by humans. Further analysis suggests that the Barbary stag, including the Corsican red deer, belongs to a separate species, and should be grouped under the name Cervus corsicanus. Predators The Barbary stag has, or has had, predators like the Barbary lion, the Atlas bear, and the Barbary leopard, but they have either become extinct or are endangered.

He named the Order in honor of his ancestor High Chiefess Kapiʻolani the Great, an early exponent of Christianity in the Hawaiian Islands. It also honored his wife Queen Kapiʻolani, the namesake of the first Kapiʻolani. This Order was awarded 177 times in all grades during Kalākaua's reign, and three more times by his successor, Queen Liliʻuokalani. The last award of the Order took place on June 2, 1892; in 1893 the Order became obsolete.  Grades  The Order was awarded in six grades. Granting the insignia and awards of the Order was determined by the number of living members of the Order. At any given time there could only be: * Grand Cross – 12 recipients * High Grand Officer – 15 recipients * Grand Officer – 20 recipients * Commander – 30 recipients * Officer – 50 recipients * Companion (Knight) – 60 recipientsThe Companion Cross was abolished on June 23, 1884. * Medal of Honor – no limit to recipients, 1st (silver) and 2nd-degree (bronze)Those awarded Medals of Honor did not enjoy the privilege of holding rank in the Order.  Insignia of the Order   Grand Cross  Grand Cross The insignia of the Grand Cross includes the badge, breast star and grand cordon. The Order's badge comprises a red enameled gold Maltese cross, surmounted by a gold Hawaiian crown. Between the arms of the cross are gold Hawaiian crowns in angles. A center disc of red and white enamel displays a gold double-K monogram, surrounded by a white enamel band, on which is inscribed \\"KULIA I KANUU\\" – \\"Strive to Reach the Summit\\". At end of the cross is a small, gold locket with the portrait of Queen Kapiʻolani. On the reverse is a single red disc, with the motto \\"KULIA\\". The star of the Grand Cross of Order is an octagonal silver star, on which is superimposed the badge without the surmounted crown. The grand cordon is yellow, bordered by narrow stripes of the colors the Hawaiian flag: white, red and dark-blue. The badge is fastened to the sash's bow and rests on the hip.  High Grand Officer  High Grand Officers bear the same insignia as the Grand Cross, except the badge is not worn on a sash, rather on a neck ribbon of alternating yellow and red strips.  Grand Officer  Grand Officers wear only the breast star.  Commander  The insignia of Commander is identical to that of Grand Cross, except the Commander wears only the sash. In addition, on the badge the crowns between the arms of the cross are silver, not gold. Officer cross Companion cross  Officer & Companion  The Officer and Companion cross use an identical badge to that of the Commander, albeit markedly smaller in size. These decorations are breast badges suspended by the badge's crown on a riband of alternating yellow and red stripes. A rosette is affixed to the riband of the Officer cross.  Medals of Honor  The Medals of Honor are similar to the Companion cross; however they lack the crowns between the arms of the cross and the badge's crown surmounting the cross. The medal of the 1st-degree is made of silver, and the 2nd-degree of bronze.  Annuity  Along with being granted insignia of the Order, an annuity was given to the recipients: $150 for the Grand Cross, $130 for the Grand High Officer, $125 for the Grand Officer, $100 for the Commander, $75 for the Officer and $50 for the Companion.  Recipients  The first recipient of the Royal Order of Kapiʻolani was Auguste Jean Baptiste Marques. He was made Commander in 1880. Dr. Charles M. Newell, of Boston wrote several romantic novels about the Hawaiian Islands in the late 19th century, including Kalani of Oahu (1881), Kamehameha the Conquering King (1885) and The Voyage of the Fleetwing (1886) and The Isle of Palms (1888). His Companion is believed awarded in 1885 and was sold by Cowans Auctions in 2010. Queen Natalie of Serbia was awarded the Grand Cross on 28 June 1883.Nacionalnarevija The Saint Marianne of Molokaʻi (born Maria Anna Barbara Koob) was awarded the Companion on November 9, 1885, for her work in Hawaiian hospitals and the Hansens Disease (Leprosy) settlement of Kalaupapa. Dr. Eduard Arning, British-German bacteriologist, was awarded the Companion in 1886 for research in Hansens Disease.  Notes   References  * Medcalf, Donald & Ronald Russell (1978).

He was convicted of the crime on July 8, 1983, and spent 19 years, 11 months, and 10 days on death row while his case was appealed. The crime On December 20, 1982, Ernel Foster, a security guard, was robbed of his .38 caliber Smith & Wesson revolver by a black male, while waiting at a bus stop in Cleveland, Ohio. Foster later testified that he chased the offender for a block and a half and was able to see his face. He further noted that the offender's hair was in small braids. On February 1, 1983, Foster was summoned to the police station to view a line-up composed of six black males. Foster was able to identify Martin, noting that his hair was braided in the same manner as it appeared on December 20, 1982. Later, Foster identified Martin in the courtroom as the man who had taken his weapon. Martin's girlfriend, Josephine Pedro, testified that he had threatened her with a gun earlier that year, telling her that he had stolen the weapon from a security guard. She wrote down the serial number of the gun on the back of an envelope box. The number was identical to the serial number of Foster's weapon except that the letter \\"D\\" had been purposely transformed into a \\"9.\\" Pedro testified that this was done to make the number sequence look like a telephone number in order to ward off any suspicion. Pedro further testified that in the early hours of January 21, 1983, Martin revealed a plan to rob Robinson's Drug Store. She attempted to dissuade him but Martin threatened her if she did not cooperate in the robbery. Martin then left the apartment and returned approximately ten minutes later with the gun he had taken from Foster. Martin devised a plan whereby Pedro was to go to the store and attempt to buy medicine for a cold. When 71-year-old Robert Robinson, owner of the store, unlocked the door to allow Pedro's entrance, Martin planned to follow her in and rob the premises. Martin wore gray pants, tennis shoes and a waist length black leather jacket. He covered his face with a brown knit cap in which he cut holes for his eyes to avoid being identified. At approximately 12:45 a.m., Pedro arrived at the store and knocked on the door. Upon recognizing Pedro, Robinson unlocked the door to let her in. However, he locked the door again before Martin could gain entry. As Robinson stood in front of the door after locking it, Martin fired two shots through the door fatally wounding him. After firing the shots Martin allegedly went to the apartment to change his clothes and then returned to the store to finish the robbery. Monty Parkey, an employee of Robinson, was in the back room at the time of the shooting. After hearing the shots and seeing what had occurred, Parkey called an ambulance and the police. He then instructed Pedro to go to Robinson's house to get Mrs. Robinson. Pedro complied and upon returning was interviewed by the police concerning the events. She gave them her name and address and stated she knew nothing about the shooting. Martin was also present at this time and talked to the police. Upon completing her interview, Pedro returned to her apartment. When Pedro reached the apartment she called her neighbor, Larry Kidd. Martin returned approximately thirty-five minutes later. Pedro asked Martin whether the evening's events had been worth it. He showed her a pile of bills under a blanket which he then took into the bathroom and explained that the robbery netted $39. Martin then drove Kidd and Pedro to an \\"after hours\\" spot for drinks. After they sat down at the table, Martin took two spent cartridges from his pocket and placed them on the table. Kidd remarked: \\"Mr. Robinson got shot twice, and you got two cartridges.\\" Martin did not respond to this comment. The investigation Several days after the shooting the police again questioned Pedro and Martin. By this time the two had put together a story for the police that Pedro had gone to the store to get cough medicine when the deceased was shot and that Martin only came to the store after she had been gone for an unusually long time. On January 29, 1983, the police returned and arrested Pedro and Martin for the murder of Robinson. After several days in jail, Pedro told the police that she had helped set up the robbery by going to the store and that Martin had shot the deceased. Soon afterwards, Martin's father contacted Pedro asking her to change her statement. While visiting Martin in jail, Martin's father again asked Pedro to change her story. Trial During the trial, the state introduced a letter dated February 13, 1983, wherein Martin asked Pedro to \\"tell the truth\\" and implicate a man named \\"Slim\\" for the murder-robbery of Robinson. An additional letter dated February 17, 1983, in which Martin again asked her to implicate \\"Slim\\", was also introduced into evidence. Pedro has continually denied that \\"Slim\\" had anything to do with these crimes. The state also offered another letter into evidence which had been written by Martin to Pedro when he was in jail in February 1981 for another offense. Pedro identified the letter and read it into the record. The letter asked Pedro to lie for Martin and to implicate someone else for the commission of the offense for which Martin was charged. Pedro admitted lying for Martin pursuant to the letter in the previous trial for the other offense. Finally, Antoinette Henderson testified that she lived with Pedro for about five or six months until the middle of December 1982. During December she heard Martin say he was going to rob Robinson's store. Martin threatened her with a gun, warning her that she had better not tell anyone of his plan. During the trial the defense presented no witnesses, but sought to introduce into evidence written statements of Pedro and Henderson. The court denied this request finding the written statements were not inconsistent as alleged by the defense. The jury found Martin guilty of the aggravated robbery of Ernel Foster and of the aggravated robbery and aggravated murder of Robert Robinson with the specification of being the principal offender of the aggravated murder while committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery. After the mitigation hearing was conducted, the jury recommended that he receive the death penalty. Appeals Although Martin's appeals centered on his arrest and his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he also attempted to introduce evidence of his innocence. E.J. Rieves-Bey lived across the street from the victim's store and witnessed someone running away from the scene after hearing shots fired. Within two weeks of the killing, he gave a statement to the Cleveland police describing the man he saw fleeing as 5'10\\" and 170 lbs, roughly matching Martin. Approximately a month later, he told a court-appointed investigator that the man was \\"About six foot, two maybe three . . . Maybe about 180, 200 pounds.\\" He also stated, \\"I know he's taller than Ernest Martin, and Ernest Martin is smaller, way smaller.\\" The State subpoenaed Rieves-Bey to testify, but he arrived just as jury deliberations began. The State sought to reopen its case and present the testimony of Rieves-Bey. The defense successfully objected, and deliberations continued. At the hearing on Martin's motion for a new trial, Rieves-Bey described the man he saw fleeing from the scene as \\"about six foot, 200 pounds.\\" He also stated that the man was wearing \\"a black coat, and a brown mask and sort of a hat.\\" He testified that several minutes after he saw the fleeing man, he saw Martin walking toward the crime scene, and that he was wearing \\"(a) brown long coat, lighter, a brown coat.\\" This description corroborated Pedro's testimony that Martin wore a black leather jacket and brown mask with holes cut for eyes, prior to and during the crime, and that when he returned to the store after the shooting, he wore a \\"long grey coat.\\" Rieves-Bey gave a 1997 deposition for purposes of Martin's habeas corpus action. He was incarcerated at the time. He insisted that Martin \\"wasn't the man\\" that he saw fleeing the scene. During the deposition, he admitted that his cocaine addiction had impaired his memory, and that he couldn't remember giving testimony in 1983 about the case. Martin's allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel were rejected by the appellate courts, and the federal courts also found that \\"although petitioner's arrest could have been illegal, his identification by the security guard and his girlfriend's statements to police were not suppressible fruits of the tainted action. The overwhelming nature of the evidence of guilt precluded petitioner from showing that prejudice resulted from any alleged deficiency in his counsel's cross-examination.\\" Execution At the time of his execution, Martin maintained his innocence and compared himself to Jesus Christ, saying he too had been \\"lied on and slandered.\\" \\"I don't hold any grudges or hatred because God is in control of all things\\", he said. \\"I thank God for this life even though it wasn't always a good one. You all know that I love you\\", he continued. \\"Hug mama and let everybody know that I love them and that we'll see each other again. You take care, media. God bless all of you. That's all I have to say.\\" See also * Capital punishment in Ohio * Capital punishment in the United States * List of people executed in Ohio Sources Court cases *State v.

Along Comes the Association is the debut studio album by the American sunshine pop band the Association and was released on Valiant Records, in July 1966 (see 1966 in music). It became one of the top-selling LPs in America, peaking at number five, and remains the Association's most successful album release, except for their Greatest Hits compilation. The album's success was primarily credited to the inclusion of their two U.S. hits \\"Along Comes Mary\\" and \\"Cherish\\", which peaked at number seven and number one respectively on the Billboard Hot 100; \\"Cherish\\" was number one on Billboard's Top 40 list for three weeks starting in September 24, 1966.Joel Whitburn. The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits. 5th edition. Billboard Books, 1992, page 657. Retrieved 20 June 2020. The album was preceded by a few non-LP singles as the Association struggled to establish themselves a commercial presence. Moving from the Jubilee record label to Valiant Records, the group released a cover version of Bob Dylan's \\"One Too Many Mornings\\", which received attention from Curt Boettcher. Boettcher, who had previously worked with the folk-rock group The GoldeBriars, and demoed \\"Along Comes Mary\\" with lead guitarist Jules Alexander, was brought in by the group to steer the Association in a pop-rock musical direction. Aside from \\"Along Comes Mary\\", the sessions with Boettcher provided the band with the song's B-side, \\"Your Own Love\\", and two other tracks that are featured on the album \\"Remember\\" and \\"I'll Be Your Man\\". The Association yielded some of the instrumental playing on And Then... Along Comes the Association to top L.A. session musicians, including guitarist Mike Deasy (who would continue to play on other Association albums), bassist Jerry Scheff, and percussionists Jim Troxel and Toxey French. And Then... Along Comes the Association saw the group experiment with luscious vocal harmonies that anticipated the musical textures of Boettcher's later groups The Millennium and Sagittarius. In addition, the album incorporated a wide- assortment of influences, including folk-rock, psychedelia, Baroque pop, and remains a cornerstone of sunshine pop. Along with the hit singles \\"Along Comes Mary\\" and \\"Cherish\\", notable tracks on the album include the reflective \\"Enter the Young\\" and the Addrissi brothers' \\"Don't Blame It on Me\\". The partnership between the Association and Boettcher—while innovative and commercially successful—was cut short after Boettcher began to overreach his authority in the group's musical direction. For their sophomore effort, Renaissance, the Association recruited Jerry Yester to replace Boettcher as a producer. In 1967, Warner Bros. bought the Valiant label and reissued the album, altering the cover by replacing all Valiant references with the Warner Bros. logo and new catalog number of 1702. On the back cover, the monaural and stereo catalog numbers of the Valiant issues at the bottom center were replaced by a \\"MORE BY THE ASSOCIATION\\" byline with the Renaissance and Insight Out album covers shown underneath.

On 23 February 1992, Rampulla was the first goalkeeper to score from open play in Serie A history, after he equalised the scoreline with a header at 1–1 away to Atalanta, from a free-kick by Alviero Chiorri in the last minute of play. However, that hard-earned point was not enough to save them from relegation at the end of the season. After the 1991–92 season finished in relegation for Cremonese, Rampulla moved to Juventus in 1992, where he enjoyed a highly successful 10-year spell at the club; he initially played as a starter, replacing Juventus's former legendary goalkeeper Stefano Tacconi, and subsequently as back-up goalkeeper for the remainder of his career, behind Angelo Peruzzi, Edwin van der Sar, and Gianluigi Buffon, and later as the reserve goalkeeper behind Andreas Isaksson and Fabian Carini, retiring from active football in 2002, following Juventus's Serie A title victory and Coppa Italia final defeat. Despite being predominantly a backup, he played matches in every competition for Juventus during almost every season of his Juventus career, in particular under Peruzzi during the mid 90s, when the latter was struggling with recurring injuries. During his time at the club, Rampulla won an UEFA Cup in 1993 (as a starter), a Coppa Italia in 1995 (as a starter), 4 Serie A titles, 2 Supercoppe Italiane (he replaced Peruzzi after he had been sent off in the 1995 edition of the tournament, contributing to his team's victory with several decisive saves), an UEFA Champions League, an UEFA Super Cup, an Intercontinental Cup, and an UEFA Intertoto Cup. His goal-scoring feat would be matched by fellow Italian keeper Massimo Taibi nine years later. International During his time with Varese, Rampulla was called up to the Italy national under-21 football team by manager Azeglio Vicini, making his debut for the Azzurrini on 20 April 1983; in total he made 10 appearances for the Italy under-21 side. Style of play Nicknamed Big Ben, Rampulla was a large, solid and reliable shot-stopper, who stood out for his professionalism and longevity throughout his career. He was also known for his ability with the ball at his feet as a goalkeeper, and had initially always wanted to play as a forward in his youth, but his father insisted that he play in goal. Because of his skill on the ball and offensive instincts, Rampulla even took penalties on occasion, and he became the first goalkeeper ever to score a goal in Serie A, with a header off of a corner kick. Coaching career After his retirement, Rampulla accepted to stay at Juventus in the club's backroom staff, serving as goalkeeping coach for most of his time. He parted company with Juventus in October 2010. On 14 July 2011, he was introduced as new head coach of Serie D club Derthona. On 5 December 2011, he terminated his contract by mutual consent with the club. On 17 May 2012, Rampulla joined former Juventus manager Marcello Lippi at Chinese Super League side Guangzhou Evergrande and became the club's goalkeeping coach. On 2 June 2016, Rampulla became the president of Cremonese substituting Luigi Simoni who had covered the presidential role for two years. Rampulla resigned from this post on 20 October 2016 and on 22 October 2016, he was announced as goalkeeping coach of the Chinese national football team, under the management of Marcello Lippi.

He was also renowned for having The Beatles open for the Royal Showband at a concert on 2 April 1962 at the Pavilion Theatre, Liverpool, England, some six months before the release of The Beatles first single \\"Love Me Do\\", in October 1962. Bowyer was regarded as one of the first headlining Elvis impersonators. Elvis Presley himself was a big fan of Bowyer's performances and would often attend Bowyer's concerts in the Stardust Resort & Casino, Las Vegas during the 1970s. Career Brendan Bowyer began his career with the Royal Showband in 1957. His ability to tailor American rock and roll music to the tastes of Irish audiences, and his athletic, spirited on-stage performances made him a popular vocalist of the 1960s Irish showband era. On 6 September 1963, Brendan Bowyer and the Royal Showband became the first Irish artists to top the Irish Singles Chart, with the hit \\"Kiss Me Quick,\\" which stayed at the number one position for seven weeks. They were to return to the top position later that year with \\"No More,\\" and repeated the feat in 1964 with \\"Bless You.\\" Bowyer took part in the 1965 Irish National Song Contest for a chance to represent Ireland at the Eurovision Song Contest in Naples with the song \\"Suddenly in Love\\", but could only manage fifth place.

The band spent the summers playing the ballroom circuit in Ireland but also spent six months of the year in Las Vegas, Nevada, US. Within a short time, Bowyer and the band made the decision to relocate to Las Vegas permanently. He was based in Las Vegas from then on, though he made frequent trips back to Ireland. In 1977 he made a brief return to the Irish charts with his tribute, \\"Thank You Elvis.\\" Having enjoyed a semi-retirement phase, Bowyer returned to the spotlight, touring Ireland each year, some for months on end, with his daughter Aisling Bowyer, and a six piece band. They performed his showband era hits, dance numbers, nationalist songs, modern contemporary songs and concert hits. 2001 saw the release of Follow On, a covers album, where Bowyer performed some of the most popular Irish songs, such as \\"Summer in Dublin,\\" \\"What's Another Year,\\" \\"Past the Point of Rescue,\\" and \\"I Don't Like Mondays.\\" 2005 saw Brendan and Aisling headlining the entertainment list for the Tall Ships Festival in Waterford, performing in the open air to an estimated crowd of 12,000.

It was designed by John Smith Murdoch and built in by John Steward & Co. It is also known as Pancake Manor. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. History Foundation stone, 2017 The site was purchased in 1903 by the Church of England for a new mission church. Prior to this, the mission had rented rooms throughout Brisbane and St Luke's provided its first permanent home. On 3 February 1904 the foundation stone of St Luke's Church was laid by His Excellency, Sir Herbert Chermside, Governor of Queensland. St Luke's served as a temporary cathedral between the demolition of St Johns Pro-Cathedral, 1904 and the opening of St Johns Cathedral in 1910. Architect, John Smith Murdoch, was commissioned to design a church which would utilise fully the limited site area. Murdoch, who was an architect for the Queensland Works Department (1894-1903); Chief Architect for Home Affairs (1919-1922) and Chief Architect of the Commonwealth (1926-30) took leave of absence to design St Luke's and Webber House. St Luke's was purpose built for the Mission headquarters, providing meeting rooms in the basement. John Steward & Co constructed St Luke's which was dedicated on 14 August 1904 by the Administrator, the Venerable Arthur Evan David, Archdeacon of Brisbane. On St Thomas Day, 21 December 1904, St Clair George Alfred Donaldson was enthroned as Bishop of Brisbane in St Luke's. The ceremony was well attended by prominent clergy members and, as the church could only seat 402 people, entry was restricted to ticket holders only. After 1910 St Luke's served its intended purpose as the headquarters of the Anglican Church Mission. The Mission was an evangelistic group which worked amongst the disadvantaged supplying food and shelter for the destitute and saving young girls from moral degradation. It also provided ministering to districts without parishes or churches. It ran several youth clubs, including the Newsboys Club, providing social companionship and spiritual guidance for the members. In 1908 the Overseas Girls Club was founded and later the hall was used as a meeting and recreational venue for the Girls Friendly Society. Facilities at the Anzac club included a lounge & music room, a billiard room, a reading & writing room and a refreshment room, 1917 During the First World War Canon David Garland, resident Chaplain of St Luke's, was Director of the Soldiers Church of England Help Society and the Mission corresponded with servicemen at the front. An Anzac Club was opened at St Luke's for returned soldiers and the hall was used for Sunday teas and dances. On 18 June 1917 a Nurses Honour Board was unveiled in St Luke's War Chapel in recognition of those who served in World War I. During the Second World War St Luke's provided a meeting place and Saturday night dances for soldiers stationed in Brisbane. St Luke's remained the Mission Headquarters until the 1950s and the meeting place of the Synod of the Diocese until 1977, after which St Luke's was no longer needed for church purposes. In 1979 St Luke's Church was converted into a restaurant, the Pancake Manor.  Description  Building entrance, 2017 St Luke's is a finely detailed brick building in the Romanesque style whose predominant feature is the massive relieving archway containing vertical openings at the end of the chancel. It has a complicated roof form combining both hips and gables, along with a small octagonal tower near the entry. The roof sheeting is rolled iron. The plain brickwork is punctuated by bands of different coloured brick and the occasional use of stone around windows and doors. The building has the unusual arrangement of having entries to both floor levels at the chancel end in an attempt to optimise the building's orientation. The major entry to the upper church level is defined by a recessed porch. The exterior and interior finishes of the building are particularly intact, despite the building's change of use, installation of kitchen facilities, and inappropriate interior door and external signage.  Heritage listing  St Luke's was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Luke's was purpose built as a hall with meeting rooms to assist the Church of England Mission in its role of providing Christian charity to the community and ministering to districts without parishes or churches. St Luke's has religious significance as the Anglican Pro-Cathedral, 1904-1910, as the Mission Headquarters, 1904-1950s, and as the meeting place of the Synod of the Diocese until 1977 and socially significant as a recreational venue for Anglican youth groups and World War I and World War 2 veterans. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The quality of its polychrome brickwork and picturesque roof forms make the building visually appealing, and is a successful example of a building designed to fulfil the dual purpose of both Mission headquarters and Church.

Development Transportation to New South Wales (then, the colony covering the eastern Australian mainland, modern New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland) had ceased in 1840 and the number transported to Van Diemen's Land increased sharply. A two-year suspension of the transportation of male convicts to Van Diemen's Land was implemented in May 1846. It was the intention to resume transportation under new arrangements but that decision was conveyed to the local colonial administrator, William Denison in the following terms: \\"it is not the intention that transportation should be resumed at the expiration of the two years\\"; the words \\"under the present system\\" were omitted. The dispatch, taken to mean what it said on its face, was made public before the imperial authorities corrected their error. By 1851, it had developed into the Australasian League for the Abolition of Transportation with branches on the mainland. In Tasmania's first partially elective Legislative Council, its supporters won all 16 seats up for election. The Legislative Council subsequently voted 16 to 4 to request Queen Victoria to revoke the Order in Council, permitting transportation to Tasmania and Norfolk Island in spite of the strong opposition of Lieutenant Governor William Denison. The Victorian gold rush, commencing in the same year, led the British Government to discontinue transportation, because it was seen as an incentive for criminals to be transported to eastern Australia, and the last convict ship to be sent from England, the St. Vincent, arrived in Tasmania in 1853.

The supporting cast features Lionel Barrymore, Sydney Greenstreet, Valentina Cortese, John Hodiak, Richard Loo, Gilbert Roland and DeForest Kelley. Plot In January 1942, the month after the United States entered World War II, reporter John Royer returns to the United States. He goes to see his friend, newspaper publisher John Manchester, about a scheme to smuggle desperately needed rubber out of Japanese-occupied Malaya. Manchester, though he has been selected by the government to deal with the rubber shortage, does not seem interested, but later, government agent Kellar takes him to a meeting with Manchester and others. They give their approval. Royer needs the help of his old friend, Carnaghan; he gets Carnaghan released from Alcatraz (where Royer's newspaper exposé had landed him) to help. They slip into Malaya and contact Carnaghan's associate, the Dutchman, who recruits a gang for them from customers in his saloon, including Romano. Carnaghan also renews his acquaintance with the saloon's singer, Luana from Italy. Using money and intimidation, they succeed in purchasing all the available rubber, but eventually the Japanese commander, Colonel Tomura, gets wind of the scheme. On the last trip to transport the remaining rubber, belonging to part-German plantation owner Bruno Gerber, to a waiting freighter, Carnaghan smells an ambush. He forces Gerber to confess that he tipped off Tomura. Royer decides to try going around the ambush, but Carnaghan refuses to go with him. Royer is killed by the waiting soldiers. Tomura hints to the Dutchman that he would be willing to look the other way and let the rubber go in return for gold. Despite the Dutchman's certainty that Tomura is lying, the cynical Carnaghan takes him up on his offer. The Dutchman is right; Carnaghan is captured by Tomura. He takes Tomura to where the freighter lies hidden, but when a Japanese warship arrives, it is met by two PT boats, which proceed to sink it with torpedoes. Carnaghan shoots first the soldiers guarding him, then Tomura, but is himself wounded. When Malaya is liberated by the Allies, Kellar tracks Carnaghan down to an island, where he has settled down with Luana, to give him a medal. Carnaghan refuses the medal, and tells Kellar to give the medal to the Dutchman.

Like the red deer of Ireland, it migrated from continental Europe sometime in the Stone Age. The Scottish red deer is farmed for human consumption. Description This deer is slightly smaller than other Western European red deer. In summer, the coat is lighter in colour with a distinct border to the lighter patch on the rump. The rest of the colour is dark reddish brown with a greyer face and neck. The legs are blackish brown. In winter the animal grows long hair on the neck. The brow and the bez tines of the antler are usually close together and at a distance above the burr. Range This deer thrives in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland and in parts of England such as Westmorland, Devon, Somerset, Wiltshire and the New Forest. It is also found in County Kerry and Donegal in Ireland. However, most of the red deer kept in parks in the British Isles are derived from the larger subspecies brought from the European mainland, the Western European red deer (Cervus elaphus elaphus). This subspecies has also escaped from deer parks and has become feral in some areas. Although mostly found in the north of Scotland, there are reports of deer being spotted in the Borders.  Population  The UK's red deer population doubled in the 50 years leading up to 2018, with more than half of those animals found in Scotland. The rising population has sparked significant debate surrounding management, with proponents of culls citing the damage caused to forests and rare plants. They also pose a risk to drivers, with around 6,000 traffic collisions involving red deer taking place each year. Approximately 100,000 are culled each year, although a 2017 report by MSPs argued that efforts to manage numbers are not succeeding. Research by the Forestry Commission in 2014 stated that rising deer populations pose the biggest threat to Scotland's native ancient woodlands. In November 2019 it was revealed that a 45-year study indicated that climate change had affected the gene pool of the red deer population on Rùm, one of the Inner Hebrides islands, Scotland. Warmer temperatures resulted in deer giving birth on average three days earlier for each decade of the study. The gene which selects for earlier birth has increased in the population because does with the gene have more calves over their lifetime.

However it has also been said that St Olcan was discovered as a baby in the area of what is now Armoy, where he would eventually found his church. Olcan’s birth had occurred after his mother, who had come from over the sea, had died and he lay with her body for seven days before he was discovered by St Patrick. Olcán was baptised by St Patrick. In a 16th-century manuscript titled Martyrology of Salisbury, the claim is made that Olcan’s mother was St. Patrick’s sister. St Olcan was sent to France and returned to Ireland to become the first Christian bishop in Ireland. Olcán was consecrated Bishop around 474, when St Patrick himself was long established in Armagh. He was ordained at Dunseverick Castle on the North Coast by St. Patrick, who then sent Olcán to study in Gaul. Olcán and the Dál Riata Olcán's church in Armoy lay in territory controlled by the Dál Riata, while neighbouring territories were controlled by other ruling dynasties: the southern and western parts of what is now County Antrim and west County Down by the Cruithni, and west County Down by the Dál Fiatach. In the 7th century, Tírechán relates that Patrick had granted a share of the prized relics of St Peter and Paul (and further saints) to Olcán, indicating how much Patrick and his community expected of Olcán and their alliance with the Dál Riata. However, the fortunes of the Dál Riata in Ireland were adversely affected, while their future rather lay in Scotland, notably in Argyll. As a consequence of losing such political support, Olcán's church were prone to dispossession. The Tripartite Life tells that the lands attached to Armoy were seized and regranted to the saints Mac Nisse of Connor and Senán \\"of Inis Cathaig\\" (probably for Senán of Láthrach Briúin). He is strongly historically and devotionally linked to County Antrim. There are the remains of a round tower on the edge of the Armoy village. Olcán's Well Cranfield Church, Lough Neagh The ruins of Cranfield Church, a 13th-century Irish church which lies on the northern shore of Lough Neagh at Churchtown Point, Cranfield, County Antrim, carries a tradition of belief Olcán blessed his well with healing properties.BBC Northern Ireland profile Olcán was reputedly buried at Cranfield Church in earth brought from Rome.\\"St. Olcan's Well\\", Kickham's Creggan GAC Within the well are gypsum crystals, known locally as ‘amber pebbles’, which were also thought to have healing properties. It was believed that they protected women in childbirth; fishermen from drowning; and homes from fire and burglary. Emigrants leaving for America in the 19th century thought that swallowing pebbles would provide them with a safe passage across the Atlantic Ocean. It was widely held that the well would overflow on 29 June and the amber pebbles would rise to the surface on that day.\\"Religious Beliefs\\", Lough Neagh Heritage Project Despite the best efforts of the Church, the healing tradition of the well has carried on to present times. Afflicted areas of the body are bathed with a rag dipped in the well, followed by prayers and finally the rag is tied to one of the trees the belief being that as the rag disintegrates so the affliction will disappear. Today the trees are full of ribbons, pieces of string, and strips of material showing that some traditions never die. The Stations Throughout Ireland there are still a limited number of places where \\"stations\\" or \\"patterns\\" are held to the present day, one of these being Lough Derg. This is a very ancient form of devotion and was a major event at Cranfield until it died out in the first half of the 1800s. In its heyday, the stations at Cranfield would have attracted hundreds if not thousands of pilgrims from the lough shore area of Antrim, Londonderry and Tyrone. The practice could be carried out anytime between May Eve and St Olcan’s Feast Day on June 29. The person performing the station collected seven ordinary small stones with which to count. Then, kneeling at the door of the ruined church the pilgrim said the Our Father, Hail Mary and the Creed. He then walked slowly (usually barefoot) clockwise round the church saying the Rosary. Arriving back at the door he dropped a pebble. These slow rounds of the church continued, a pebble being dropped each time the pilgrim passed the door until he had completed seven rounds. The same practice was carried out round the well seven times with a pebble being dropped each time. Upon completing this the pilgrim drew some water from the well to bathe themselves with. This procedure could be carried out on three consecutive days or all twenty one rounds of the Church and Well respectively could be carried out on the same day. Legacy The former St Olcan's High School, which was named in his honour, merged with St Malachy's High School, Antrim to form St. Benedict's High School, is in Randalstown, County Antrim.

Providing a new twist to the common creation myth from The Book of Genesis, the author writes a parody incorporating new characters and a new ending. Titled El amigo de El y Ella, this new version begins with Adam and Eve angry and upset because they are not alone in the garden, there is another man accompanying them in Paradise, Don Jeronimo. This unexpected guest is described as wearing pajamas and having a thick mustache. Though the title directly translates to The Friend of Him and Her, Don Jeronimo is perceived as being a nuisance to both Adam and Eve until he swoons Eve and later marries her. In every culture there is some sort of degree with which people agree to describe the reality of the world.  Plot  Upset and angry by the fact that they are not alone in Paradise, Adam and Eve are accompanied by another man with a big mustache wearing pajamas. Every day this man, Don Jeronimo, greets the two of them very cordially and attempts to befriend them. Even though Don Jeronimo's intentions are solely to become friends with Adam and Eve, they cannot help but feel angry because the Paradise was only meant for the two of them. Don Jeronimo owns a hotel and has cows which he tends to, all of which irritate Adam and Eve more. One day, Don Jeronimo asks them whether there are others living in Paradise and they respond by saying no and that they are the first people. He congratulates them and invites Adam and Eve to dinner. The reunion between the three of them did not seem right, the picture was not meant to be painted with the three of them but rather only Adam and Eve and the serpent. To Adam and Eve, Paradise was ruined; the gentleman with the mustache had spoiled their plans. However, as Adam and Eve began to spend more time with Don Jeronimo, little by little they began to like him and become entertained by his jokes. They saw that he was a kind generous man and so the three of them were delighted to be in each other's company. Don Jeronimo asked Adam and Eve if they were married. Not knowing how to answer and unaware of what that meant, they responded by saying no. Don Jeronimo followed up by asking whether they were brother and sister, Adam and Eve answered saying yes, they were brother and sister. A thought then came into Don Jeronimo's mind. He began to tell more jokes to Eve to impress her and even gave her some of his cows. He told her he loved her and the two of them married. They had children whom as they grew created more noise and chaos in Paradise. Even though Adam respected Don Jeronimo, he and the serpent began to feel anger as they realized Paradise would never be what it was. There was nothing more to say or do, change was inevitable.  History and analysis  The author presents the audience with a humorous version of the creation myth from The Book of Genesis, Adam and Eve. Miguel Mihura is a playwright; from a young age he loved theater and could imagine a different life through his pieces. He is considered one of the best comics of Spanish theater from the 20th century because he learned to balance comical and absurd language. His story El Amigo de El y Ella was published in 1942. He wrote this story during the postwar era; his story helped improve morale of the Spanish people. Along with this piece, Mihura's other works usually incorporate a strange character that adds a twist to the story.  Themes  * Miguel Mihura's version of Adam and Eve focuses on the theme that sometimes there are certain plans that unexpectedly change and we cannot do anything about it. Though Adam and Eve did not plan to have a guest accompany them in the garden, there was nothing they could do to change it. Don Jeronimo was there to stay and even though he married Eve and their children created more chaos in Paradise, there was nothing more to do. Change was inevitable and the others must adjust accordingly.  Bibliography  * Pfaff, Raquel H, and Angela Labarca. Convocación De Palabras: Lectura Y Redacción. Boston, Mass: Thomson Heinle, 2006.

Some cranial features suggest it may be an archaic relative of the paramo Oldfield mouse (Thomasomys paramorum). The upper parts are greyish yellow with a darker head and yellowish-white underparts. Fine hairs are mixed with flattened and grooved spines that are most numerous on the back.Walker's Mammals of the World (6th Edition, 1999) by Ronald M. Nowak, The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore and London. Taxonomy This rat was first described by Cunha and Cruz in 1979 and is named in honour of the Brazilian naturalist Augusto Ruschi (1915 - 1986). Description A medium-sized rodent, Ruschi's rat has a broad head and rounded ears. Adults have a total length of between , about half of which is the tail. The fur is short and dense. Some of the hairs are slender while others are spiny, especially on the back and rump; each spiny hair is flattened and stiff, with a longitudinal groove, and is broadest in the middle. The fur is agouti (banded in light and dark), and there is little difference in shade between the greyish-yellow upper parts of the animal and the slightly paler underparts. Distribution Ruschi's rat is native to eastern South America. The type locality is Espírito Santo in southeastern Brazil, and it is also known from several locations in Misiones Province in northeastern Argentina, and from near Rio de Janeiro and in Santa Catarina State. The precise extent of its range is unknown. Ecology This species is poorly known. It has been caught in traps set on the ground so it is probably terrestrial rather than arboreal, and this is borne out by its anatomy. Observations of one individual feeding suggests that the diet is mainly fruits, seeds and foliage. Status A. ruschii is found in forests in southeastern Brazil and northern Argentina. Although some of the forest is fragmented, the rat has a wide range and no particular threats have been identified. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of least concern.

The Caspian red deer is sometimes referred to as maral, noble deer, or eastern red deer. Classification The Caspian red deer is a subspecies of the red deer. Description The Caspian red deer is around tall, and can weigh . Their antlers are around in length, and in girth. Its coat is dark gray, except in the summer, when it is a dark brown. They shed their antlers in late winter and their new antlers reach full growth in late summer. One, occasionally two, fawns are born in mid-spring. The fawns are reddish brown with white spots. Ecology and behaviour The Caspian red deer is a social and primarily nocturnal animal. It eats a variety of grasses and leaves and occasionally berries and mushrooms. Domestication The Caspian red deer has been domesticated recently. Threats Within Russia, the Caspian red deer has been hunted for velvet antlers since the 1930s. Historically, demand for velvet antlers from Asia was met by organized deer farms in the Soviet Union. Hunting by humans have been noted as the cause for decreases in population. The approximate number of Caspian red deer in eastern Georgia dropped from 2,500 in 1985 to 880 in 1994. Their primary predators include leopards and, to a lesser extent, wolves and brown bears. In the past they were also hunted by the now-extinct Caspian tiger.

Description The cursor grass mouse is a moderately sized rodent, with a head-body length of , and a tail long. Males are larger than females, weighing an average of , compared with for females. They have a typical mouse-like appearance, with short whiskers and stubby claws on the feet. They have dark to golden brown fur over most of their body, with paler greyish or yellowish underparts. Some have a whitish spot between the ears, but this is not present on all individuals. Cursor grass mice are members of the A. cursor species group, and very similar in appearance to other members of the group. In particular, they cannot easily be distinguished from the closely related montane grass mouse, which inhabits neighbouring regions to the immediate south. Although the cursor grass mouse is, on average, slightly larger than the montane species, there is too much overlap for this to be a reliable guide. Instead, they can most readily be distinguished by the presence of a gall bladder in A. cursor (absent in the montane species), by karyotypic analysis, or by means of PCR based techniques. Distribution and habitat The exact geographic range of the cursor grass mouse is disputed. It is definitively known to inhabit eastern Brazil from Paraiba to Paraná, where it lives in patches of tropical Atlantic Forest and restinga scrubland at elevations from sea level to . Some sources also report it as being found further south, in extreme southern Brazil, in eastern Paraguay, and in northern Argentina. These latter sources lack a definitive genetic analysis of the individuals identified, and it has been argued that they may represent members of other species, such as the montane grass mouse. No subspecies are recognised. Biology and behaviour Cursor grass mice are omnivorous. Their primary diet consists of small arthropods, especially Hymenoptera, beetles, and spiders; this is supplemented by seeds of Cecropia and other plants. They search for food through leaf litter and patches of dense vegetation, and are strictly terrestrial. Individuals have a home range of , with the ranges of males being larger than those of females. Although the size of their home ranges does not change, the population density of cursor grass mice becomes significantly higher during the rainy season, when insects are most abundant. Cursor grass mice breed throughout the year, although most births occur during the dry season between June and September. Pregnant females construct globular nests, and give birth to a litter of two to nine young, with an average of four, after a gestation period of 23 days. This species is particularly important for public health since it has been implied as a Hantavirus reservoir. A cell line derived from a liposarcoma in a cursor grass mouse has been used by biomedical scientists in the construction of a panel for the identification of human chromosomes in hybrid cells.

It and its five-acre (2 ha) churchyard feature prominently in Washington Irving's 1820 short story \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\". The churchyard is often confused with the contiguous but separate Sleepy Hollow Cemetery. It is the second oldest extant church and the 15th oldest extant building in the state of New York, renovated after an 1837 fire. Some of those renovations were reversed 60 years later, and further work was done in 1960. It was listed on the Register in 1966, among the earliest properties so recognized. It had already been designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. It is still the property of the Reformed Church of the Tarrytowns, which holds summer services there, as well as on special occasions such as Christmas Eve. Building The building was designed and funded by Frederick Philipse I, Lord of Philipse Manor, a wealthy merchant trader, slaver, and landowner. It is located on the east side of Albany Post Road, opposite the Devries Road intersection, just north of downtown Sleepy Hollow. The neighborhoods to the west are residential. A wooded area to the southeast buffers the church from residential areas in that direction. Approximately 300 ft (100 m) to the south is the mill pond at Philipsburg Manor House, another National Historic Landmark. The churchyard and Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, itself listed on the Register, are to the north. The structure is rectangular, with a three-sided projecting rear apse on the east end. It has two-foot–thick (60 cm) fieldstone walls. They give way to clapboard above the roofline, within the fields of the Flemish-style gambrel roof, with its lower segments flaring outward like a bell. On the west end of the roof is an octagonal wooden open belfry. Within it is the original bell, with an engraved verse from Romans 8:31, \\"Si Deus Pro Nobis, Quis Contras Nos?\\" (\\"If God be for us, who can be against us\\") and \\"VF\\", Philipse's initials. The latter monogram is also on the wrought iron weathervane atop the belfry. and a To the west a stone retaining wall raises the church above grade level. A few shrubs flank the stone steps that lead up to the main entrance, paneled wooden double doors recessed within a Gothic archway. Above it is a glass transom with curved, intersecting muntins. It is set within a brick surround. The north and south side elevations have double-hung sash windows, as do the two side facets of the apse. At the roofline is a molded wooden cornice. The interior has its wooden pews, with two side aisles, arranged so all can focus on the pulpit. The pulpit is located on a raised platform in the rear, directly opposite the main entrance. A balustrade with turned wooden posts, open at the aisles, sets the platform off from the rest of the wide-planked floor. Behind it is a table, with a lectern on the north and an enclosed pew along the south side. The ornate wooden pulpit is raised further above the table level; access is provided by a short spiral stair. A pipe organ is located at the rear. History Frederick Philipse I, Lord of Philipse Manor, owned the vast stretch of land spanning from Spuyten Duyvil in the Bronx to the Croton River. After swearing allegiance and later being granted his Manorship from the English, he chose to establish his country seat at what was then known as North Tarrytown, where the Pocantico River flowed into the Hudson River. A small community had already been established there when he arrived in 1683, with 50 burials in the small cemetery. He built the first church for them at the southern end of the cemetery. Philipse's wife died in 1691, and he soon remarried. His second wife, Catharine Van Cortlandt Derval, urged him to build a more permanent stone church for his tenants, and later in the decade he obliged her, being its architect, financier, and aid in its construction (said to have built the pulpit with his own hands).Edited Appletons Encyclopedia, Famous Americans: Biography of Frederick Philipse: \\"...He worked at the carpenter's trade for several years, aided in building the Old Dutch church, and is said to have made the pulpit with his own hands. A marble tablet in front of the church gives its completion date as 1699. The tablet was placed in the 19th century, however, and it is seen as more likely that the church was finished by 1697. The congregation was organized that year, the same year the first pastor began serving. The early history of the church and its members was recorded by Dirck Storm, in his book Het Notite Boeck der Christelyckes Kercke op de Manner of Philips Burgh. It continued to serve as the church of Philipse Manor through the Revolution, when the family's lands were confiscated by the state for siding with the Crown. At that time the special pews for the Lord of the Manor were removed and the plain oak benches for the tenants were replaced with pine pews. Thereafter it continued without the patronage. Washington Irving, whose Sunnyside estate was a few miles to the south, made the church famous when he gave it prominent mention in his early 19th-century Halloween short story \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" as both a setting and a site connected with the Headless Horseman. Irving later gave yellow bricks from the church to outline the construction date on the wall above the door at Bolton Priory in Pelham Manor, New York. In 1837 a fire damaged the church. During the repairs some significant changes were made to the building. The main entrance was moved from the south facade to its current location on the west, the windows and door entry were changed to the Gothic arches then in style and given brick surrounds. Inside, the north gallery was removed and the west one enlarged. The original ceiling beams and pulpit were replaced. Sixty years later the church was renovated again for its bicentennial. That work reversed the 1837 renovations by restoring the original ceiling and reproducing the original pulpit. The Tarrytowns had grown through the 19th century, and a branch church had been built in Tarrytown to minister to the expanded congregation. Eventually that church became the main church, and the original building was used only for special occasions, a practice that continued until the most recent renovation in the 1990s. Currently, worship services are held from June through September.

He was a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. He commenced his domestic career with Sussex in 2000, although he now plays for Warwickshire. He has represented England but lost his place to Matt Prior in 2009. Ambrose has also represented the New South Wales U17's team. Ambrose is also renowned and criticised for how far back he stands behind the wicket. Ambrose retired from cricket at the end of the 2020 season. Domestic career His first notable cricketing performance was in the Second XI Championship in 2000, when he played two games in the season. He soon established himself in the first-class team, having helped Sussex out of the Second Division and helping them stay in the First Division ever since. Since 2003, Ambrose has played Twenty20 cricket. Ambrose transferred to Warwickshire in 2006. His highest first-class score, achieved in May 2007, was an innings of 251 not out, against Worcestershire. Ambrose formed half of Warwickshire's record fifth wicket partnership when he and Jim Troughton added 335 against Hampshire, at Birmingham, on 24 April 2009. With Laurie Evans, he also set a new Warwickshire record for a sixth wicket partnership on 1 July 2015: the pair added 327 against Ambrose's former county Sussex in the County Championship, also at Birmingham. Having held the previous county record for a sixth wicket partnership, 226 with Heath Streak against Worcestershire at New Road in 2007, Ambrose continues to be the only man to have featured in two current record partnerships for Warwickshire in first class cricket (Ian Bell has done so for Warwickshire in the 20 over format).

The film was made through a partnership between Brazilian and Italian studios and starred Rodrigo Santoro, Othon Bastos and Cassia Kiss. The film tells the story of Neto, a young man who is admitted to a psychiatric hospital after his father discovers he is a user of marijuana. There, Neto is subjected to abuse. In addition to abuse by psychiatric hospitals, the film deals with the issues of drugs and relationships between fathers and sons. Bodanzky read Carrano's book in 1996 and, impressed by the theme, assigned Luiz Bolognesi to adapt it into a film and transpose its setting from the 1970s to the 1990s. In addition to keeping the film in the present, Bodanzky chose to make it a documentary-style film to create greater impact on the viewer. Bolognesi began writing in 1997 with the freedom to make changes to the original story. The film was shot in early 2000 in São Paulo, and was edited and finalized in Italy. Brainstorm had its premiere at the Rio Film Festival in October 2000. It subsequently received several awards and nominations both domestically and internationally; among them, Best Actor at the Cartagena Film Festival, and Best Film at the Brasília Film Festival. Domestic critical response was generally favorable and focused on the acting and its themes. On the other hand, international critics were more mixed in their response.  Plot  The film opens as Mr. Wilson reads a letter he has received from his son Neto, in which Neto declares his contempt for his father. It is followed by a flashback to explain the story; Neto, a São Paulo middle-class teenager, has a troubled relationship with his father and his mother, Meire. One day, Neto travels with his friend Lobo to Santos without informing his parents. They go to an apartment where they swim and eat food; Neto leaves the place when Lobo suggests that they reciprocate for the food by letting the men there caress them. Alone in downtown, Neto begs for money, and he is helped by a woman called Leninha. She takes him home to have lunch with some friends; after it, Neto and Leninha have sex. Later, at night, he is arrested for doing graffiti, and his parents pick him up at the police station. The following day, Neto is in his bedroom and his father finds a marijuana cigarette in his jacket. Neto's sister advises his parents to send him to a mental institution. Wilson tricks Neto and brings him to a hospital where he is forcibly admitted without any examination to verify its necessity. Neto is sedated by a nurse before receiving the diagnosis of Dr. Cintra. When he wakes up, Neto encounters Ceará, a hyperactive man, and finds out the hospital is decaying and careless. He also meets Rogério, an injectable drug user committed by his family, who tells him it is impossible to escape and that if he were to try he would be drugged with haloperidol or electrocuted. Rogério also tells him not to consume the medications administered by nurses because it awakes the appetite in order to make patients look healthier. Meanwhile, Cintra has a conversation in which he discusses that if necessary he could easily admit more people, mostly homeless, to avoid losing the government subsidy. After some time, Neto's parents and sister visit him, and are deceived by the doctor who says Neto requires months of treatment. Neto begs his parents to take him with them and they refuse. Days later, Neto tries to escape but is captured and receives electroshock treatment. Suddenly, on another day, his father visits him to say he and Meire miss him; Neto asks to leave the place and Wilson takes him away. At home, his mother asks a downcast Neto if he wants to return to school or to work as a salesman; he decides to work. The mother of one of his friends forbids Neto to see him, and he discovers Leninha is a married woman. Then, he becomes distressed to the point of leaving a client in the midst of a sale. To unwind, Neto goes to a party at night, where he mixes Coca-Cola and cachaça. Drunk, he carries his friend Bel to the bathroom and they start to kiss each other. However, he goes berserk and starts to damage the place. The police are called and send him to another psychiatric hospital. In this new institution, Neto angers the nurse Ivan after reporting to the hospital's superior that the nurse overreacted while trying to calm a patient. The nurse has it out for him, and when Ivan sees Neto faking to take a pill, he injects the drug through a syringe. That night, Neto, after doping a nurse, goes to the hospital stockroom and asks the inmate Biu to set fire to a stack of drugs. When Ivan discovers this, Neto receives solitary confinement. After being released from solitary, Neto writes a letter to his father and silently gives it to him when he visits. After refusing to have his hair cut, Neto is locked in solitary once again. He sets fires to the cage and is rescued by the nurses. After reading the letter, Wilson takes him from the clinic. The films ends as Wilson cries while he and Neto are seen seated side-by-side on a curbside.  Cast  * Rodrigo Santoro as Neto * Othon Bastos as Mr. Wilson * Cássia Kiss as Meire, Neto's mother * Daniela Nefussi as Neto's sister * Jairo Mattos as Nurse Ivan * Altair Lima as Dr. Cintra Araújo * Caco Ciocler as Rogério * Linneu Dias as Jornalista * Gero Camilo as Ceará  Production  Laís Bodanzky read the autobiographical book Canto dos Malditos by for the first time in 1996, when she was signed to assist with the direction of a documentary on the subject. She found the book after entering a discussion and research group on mental health in Brazil. Impressed by its narrative, she asked Luiz Bolognesi to adapt it, as she knew he had a similar worldview and would have the respect necessary to work on the subject. Bolognesi was reluctant as he considered it a complicated subject; he was close to giving up until he read and was touched by Paulo Leminski's presentation of the book. Bodanzky's main concern was transposing the story's setting from the 1970s to the current day because she wanted to cause an impact. She felt audiences would find the situations in the film unlikely if it were set in the past. She wanted to show that the end of Brazilian military government was not the end of what she dubbed \\"concentration camps\\". To achieve this goal, she also used a documentary-like film style to generate further impact. She filmed in actual hospitals that were disabled because of reports of mistreatment, and added extras to improve the realistic climate. The original title of the film—Bicho de Sete Cabeças—is based on the song of the same name by Zé Ramalho and Geraldo Azevedo. Bodanzky declared that it was necessary to replace the book title because the film was not exactly the transposition of the book to cinema, but an adaptation inspired by it. This title can be translated as \\"seven-headed beast;\\" \\"fazer um bicho de sete cabeças\\" (\\"to make a seven-headed beast\\") is an expression in Brazil commonly used to describe an overreaction that can be compared to the English expression \\"to make heavy weather.\\"  Writing  The first version of the script was written in June 1997 during a trip for the project Cine Mambembe, which screens Brazilian films around the country in places where the people cannot pay for or do not have access to movie theaters. The trip and the screenings helped Bolognesi to write the screenplay as he \\"learned that the slightest loss of attention could be mortal and irreversible.\\" The script needed to be rewritten five times in two years as it was analyzed by Bodanzky and other collaborators. Because of costs, producers suggested the removal of several parts that helped Bolognesi make the film flow faster. Another important group of critics were five teenagers who suggested making Neto a graffiti writer, for example. Lastly and most fundamental was Carrano's approval a few months before the start of filming. In adapting the book, Bolognesi considered the work as his inspiration but felt free to create situations or characters and to modify the personality of the characters. Carrano accepted Bodanzky and Bolognesi's offer as they stated that their wish was to keep the base of the story while adapting it when necessary for the general public or to keep the efficacy of cinematic storytelling. Bolognesi wrote Neto as a shyer character than Carrano did, and made him not the leader of the class but a common student. His objective was to create a character that would reflect the regular viewer rather than \\"a hero.\\" He also softened some scenes and removed others that he thought the public would find unbelievable. In addition to the central theme—the violence of institutions against the people outside the norms—Bolognesi felt the necessity of a parallel, \\"complementary\\" discussion. First, he tried to put Neto in a love story, but he could not write something satisfying. Making it a story of love and hate, Bolognesi decided to explore another theme he considered a taboo: the father-son relationship. He based the atmosphere of the relation on Franz Kafka's Letter to His Father. He used words from a letter by Lupicínio Rodrigues to a woman to open the film, as he wanted its feelings to guide the story. Bodanzky considered the screenplay a key element of the production of Brainstorm; it was her only way of attracting a good cast and staff because it was her first feature film. It aroused the interest of lead actors Santoro, Bastos, Kiss, and the producers Sara Silveira, Caio and Fabiano Gullane. Marco Muller, Italian producer of Fabrica Cinema, was also lured by the script, and the film became a Brazil-Italy co-production.  Casting and cast preparation  Bodanzky's first choice for the main role, Santoro debuted in film with Brainstorm. Santoro was recommended by Paulo Autran, who acted along with him in the TV series Hilda Furacão. After seeing Santoro's acting, he was Bodanzky's first choice for Neto's role; \\"I never even thought of another person. ... When I saw him, I was impressed with his giving of himself to the role/character. I knew that Neto was him.\\" Santoro read the book and was \\"shocked,\\" which led him to contact Carrano; after talking to the author, he was convinced to take the role. He found the story \\"very moving, but kind of over the top,\\" and was worried about overacting and making the character \\"fake.\\" To prepare himself for the role, he talked with interns and watched productions on the subject, among them the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Miloš Forman. Sérgio Penna, a theatrical director and a theater guest professor at University of São Paulo, coordinated the cast preparation. His primary aim was to deconstruct the \\"superficial figure, stereotyped and crystallized by prejudice\\" image about psychiatric hospitals and the people who live there. The idea was to create another vision that would contain the first, but focus on \\"more humane and deep aspects.\\" Former psychiatric institution patients from the theatrical groups Pazzo a Pazzo and Teatral Ueinzz, both directed by Penna, appeared as guests. They, however, did not play characters that were interned but supporting characters who remained outside of the hospital.  Filming and editing  Filming took place in the city of São Paulo between February and April 2000, with a budget of R$1,5 million ($700,000). The biggest difficulty Bodanzky faced while producing the film was to find funders. She was helped by the Ministry of Culture's incentive laws; however, most companies did not want associate their brands to its theme. In addition to the Brazilian distributor Riofilme, half of the film cost was gathered by European resources: Italian studio Fabrica Cinema, Italian network RAI and Swiss Fondation Montecinemaveritá. Bodanzky and Bolognesi spent four months in Trieste, Italy, editing the film along with Italian editors Jacopo Quadri and Letizia Caudullo. However, the film was \\"dreamed, written and filmed\\" for Brazilian people, so they returned to Brazil to listen to their opinions. After some screenings in Brazil, they felt the film was not working as they wanted. On the airplane back to Italy, they rewrote the screenplay; they focused more on Neto and removed minor characters and subplots, while emphasizing the son-father relationship. When they arrived they had a long discussion with the Italian producers before finally agreeing and finishing the film. The film was finalized in October at the Cinecittà studio in Rome, using the THX mixing technology and the standard Dolby Digital.  Music  When Bolognesi was re-writing the screenplay, Bodanzky suggested that he listen to Arnaldo Antunes' music. According to the writer, he found some songs that seemed to be composed for the film. He then wrote some scenes and characters to fit the compositions and integrate them into the narrative. The soundtrack consists of songs by Atunes, with lyrics by André Abujamra. In addition, it features singer Décio Rocha, Zé Ramalho, Geraldo Azevedo and Zeca Baleiro, the rap band Zona Proibida and the punk rock band Infierno.  Release and reception   Accolades and public reception  Brainstorm had its premiere in October 2000, when it was selected for and screened at the 2nd Rio Film Festival. Later in the month, it was exhibited at the 24th São Paulo International Film Festival, where it was the only Brazilian film—out of eleven—to be chosen by the public as one of the twelve best films of the festival. It was also the most awarded film at the 33rd Brasília Film Festival, where it won seven awards out of thirteen, and at the 5th Recife Film Festival, where it won nine out of eleven awards. In early 2001, the film was screened in a public square during the Tiradentes Film Festival in Minas Gerais; 11% of the two thousand people in the audience gave the film a rating of \\"Good,\\" and 89% of them gave it an \\"Excellent.\\" It was released in the commercial circuit of theaters on June 22, 2001. Brainstorm grossed R$2,184,514 and was watched by 401,565 people in the 50 Brazilian theaters in which it was released. In addition, the film won several national awards; it was the most awarded film at the 1st Grande Prêmio BR de Cinema Brasileiro, winning seven out of thirteen awards: Best Film, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Score, Best Editing, Best Actor (Santoro), and Best Supporting Actor (Othon Bastos). The APCA awarded it Best Film, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor (Santoro). Santoro also received a Best Actor Award from the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil, and the Social Service of Commerce. In August 2001, Brainstorm was featured at the 54th Locarno International Film Festival, where it won the Young Jury's Award. It subsequently won several international awards, including Best Film at the 2001 Biarritz Film Festival, Best First Film at the 2001 Trieste Film Festival, and Best First Film and Best Actor at the 2002 Cartagena Film Festival. The film was awarded by the French Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Jury's Award at the 24th Créteil International Women's Film Festival. It also entered into competition for Best Film at the 2001 Stockholm International Film Festival. Moreover, the film paved the way for new thinking about psychiatric institutions in Brazil which led to a law approved by Congress that forbade such institutions.  Critical reception  Domestic reception was generally positive. Folha de S.Paulos deemed it \\"a portrait of hell in motion,\\" \\"painted with such passion, competence and integrity\\" which makes it \\"both a torment and a pleasure.\\" The newspaper commented that all Bodanzky's choices are \\"unerring\\", that the documentary tone \\"amplifies the incisiveness of history\\" and the natural dialogue, and that \\"the absence of proselytism facilitates the entry of the viewer in the universe of characters.\\" Ivan Claudio of IstoÉ Gente praised all of the cast including the extras, whose \\"wandering like zombies in the courtyards of the asylum ... contribute to the realistic climate of the film.\\" He, however, highlighted Santoro, stating that the joint effort of the cast would be meaningless without his performance. Similar comments on the cast were woven by Veja magazine, which also commended \\"the feeling of terror.\\" Santoro and Camilo, as well as the other patient actors, were praised by Marcelo Forlani of Omelete who said, \\"It's hard to believe that the actors here are not really crazy.\\" Forlani praised the photography and the sound editing as factors that differentiate it from other films. Furthermore, O Estado de S. Paulo dubbed it \\"the best Brazilian film since retomada.\\" In contrast, international critics were not so favorable. Derek Elley of American magazine Variety said that with \\"an unattractive palette of cold, blue-green hues, pic does little to build sympathy for its protagonist or any of the other characters, and flashy visual effects for Neto's mental dislocation add to the viewer's own alienation.\\" The Hindus Gautaman Bhaskaran dubbed it \\"extremely gripping\\", \\"disturbing\\"; ultimately, he declared it has a \\"morbidity\\" and a \\"sense of truth, bitter and brutal\\". Writing for Indian magazine Outlook, Namrata Joshi praised it as \\"stylishly shot, alternating between a cinéma vérité view of the Brazilian family life and MTV images of the underground youth culture.\\" Joshi, however, criticized it for its \\"excessive[ness] in the portrayal of the traumas of Neto which are evoked in the fashion of a radical, nihilistic music video,\\" and the fact he found the reason to intern Neto \\"never convincingly grounded in the narrative.\\" Similarly, Neue Zürcher Zeitung, a Swiss newspaper, criticized it for relying too much on special effects and for not presenting a deeper insight in the emotional conflict. The World Socialist Web Site stated the film has a point in its subject \\"but the simplistic and outraged tone spoils the film\\" as \\"Anyone not already convinced that such institutions are monstrous will legitimately dismiss the work as intemperate propaganda.\\"  Notes and references   Notes   References   Bibliography  *  External links  * Official website * * Category:2000 films Category:2000 drama films Category:Brazilian films Category:Italian films Category:Brazilian drama films Category:Italian drama films Category:Films based on biographies Category:Films based on Brazilian novels Category:Films directed by Laís Bodanzky Category:Films set in psychiatric hospitals Category:Films set in São Paulo Category:Films shot in São Paulo Category:Portuguese-language films Category:Best Picture APCA Award winners Category:2000 directorial debut films ","title":"Brainstorm (2000 film)"},{"id":"6894169","text":"NFL Quarterback Club 2002, also known as NFL QB Club 2002, is a football video game developed by Acclaim Studios Austin and published by Acclaim Entertainment under their Acclaim Sports banner.

It started on September 9, 2006 and ended on June 10, 2007. The 22 clubs in Serie B each played 42 matches during the regular season. The 2006–07 season marked the first Serie B appearance for two clubs, Frosinone and then 27-time Italian champions Juventus, whose involvement in the league was a direct result of the Calciopoli rulings and not competition in the previous Serie A season. A.C. Arezzo began the season with a six-point deficit and Juventus F.C. a nine-point deficit, due to their involvement in the 2006 Italian football scandal. In addition, U.S. Triestina Calcio were docked one point because of financial irregularities, and Pescara Calcio were penalized one point for late tax payments.  Events   Promotions  Despite the large deficit at the start of the league, Juventus coasted through the season with ease and became the first team mathematically promoted to the Serie A for the 2007–08 season with a 5–1 away win at Arezzo on 19 May 2007, with three games remaining in the schedule. One week later, they clinched the title of Serie B champions for 2006–07 with a 2–0 home win against Mantova. Juventus were awarded the first-ever Ali della Vittoria (Wings of Victory) Cup, designed this year for the winner of the Serie B championship. On the last day of the season Napoli played Genoa. Napoli only needed a draw for automatic promotion, while Genoa needed a win to guarantee promotion. The match ended 0–0 and Napoli were promoted. However, Piacenza only managed a 1–1 draw with Triestina, leaving it ten points behind Genoa. A gap of ten or more points between the third and fourth-placed teams meant that no playoffs would be held, and Genoa became the third team promoted to Serie A. Both Napoli and Genoa were promoted from Serie C1 to Serie B, and from Serie B to Serie A in successive seasons.  Relegations  On 12 May 2007 Pescara became the first team mathematically relegated to Serie C1 for the 2007–08 season with a 3–1 loss at Piacenza on Day 38 of the schedule. One week later, Crotone was also mathematically relegated with a 2–0 loss at Trieste. On the last match day, Arezzo became the third team relegated despite winning 3–1 at Treviso, as both Spezia and Hellas Verona won their games. Tied 2–2 with Juventus, Spezia was only seconds away from relegation, but a dramatic goal on the 91st minute by Nicola Padoin condemned Arezzo and qualified Spezia for the playoffs. The fourth team to be relegated was decided in a two-legged playoff between Verona and Spezia. The first leg ended in a 2–1 win for Spezia, and a 0–0 tie in the return match condemned Verona to play Serie C1 in the 2007–08 season.

The harbor, which was constructed in the 1960s, is located where much of Hollywood by the Sea once stood. CIBSD History, Accessed November 8th, 2009 The original Hueneme lighthouse, constructed in 1874, was adjacent to the south end of the neighborhood but the establishment of the Naval Construction Battalion Center blocked direct access to Hueneme on the other side of the port and took over the south five blocks of the Silver Strand. Shipwreck In 1970, the declining luxury cruise liner La Jenelle, formerly known as the SS Arosa Star, had been anchored off Silverstrand awaiting investments for reconditioning. On April 13 strong winds pushed the ship near the entrance of the Port of Hueneme. With only two crewmen aboard, they were unable to keep the wind and high waves from pushing the boat onto a sand bar near the beach where the ship capsized. Since the boat was well over 50 years old, it was abandoned by its owners and quickly started disintegrating in the surf. To prevent injury, the navy cut the exposed top off the boat and then filled hull and surrounding area with rocks and sand. This created a breakwater for the port as well as a popular fishing spot on the south end of the beach. Parts of the deck and hull are still visible from the south jetty and a full length view of the ship can be seen from the ocean. Beach Silver Strand Beach is a about . It is capped by the north and south jetties which both have small parking lots and limited restroom facilities. In February 2014, construction started close to the parking lot near the north jetty to build a 2-story lifeguard tower with restrooms to replace the previous one that was there since 1967, but demolished in 2002 due to storm damage.Letzer, Jennifer (November 12, 2013) \\"Plan approved for lifeguard tower at Oxnard area's Silver Strand Beach\\" Ventura County Star The coast is a sandy bottom beach break which can sometimes feature rip tides and an undertow.

One player plays the government authority, while the other plays a terrorist organization in three scenarios: the capture of a building and taking of hostages, air piracy, and nuclear blackmail. Players make their moves at the same time through the use of game paddles. Winner and loser is judged by an elaborate scoring system based upon the government player's societal values and the terrorist player's goals. Gameplay Terrorist is a two-player game that allows the players to make moves as the same time through the use of the Apple II's game paddles. The game begins with one player choosing to be the terrorist and using a scenario generator to define the government in which the terrorist incident will take place. For example, among the societal values of individual rights, state rights, and economic progress, the United States, according to the game puts most of its emphasis on the former, while Japan puts most of its emphasis on the latter. Next, the terrorist player selects one of three fictional terrorist organizations to play: the International Brotherhood for Liberation, the National Fundamentals Army, or the People's Low Republic. He also develops a list of demands that it will seek from the government that it is terrorizing. For example, the National Fundamentalist Army (NFA) is concerned that a rapist/murder is not being efficiently brought to trial and punished. Once the political environment and terrorist goals have been set, the action begins in real time. Each player simultaneously and independently calls up different options through the use of the Apple II's game paddles. Using the paddles to control the game introduces a degree of clumsiness that was intentional. According to designer Pederson, \\"You are no longer the operator of a computer, you are simulating the role of a decision maker. Your decision may or may not be executed, or may be executed too late. Just because the head of state or leader of a movement gets credit for whatever actions are taken does not mean that they are in full control of all events.\\". Reception Terrorist, like most games from Edu-Ware's zip-lock bag era, sold only a few hundred units. However, it was well reviewed, receiving an \\"A\\" rating from Peelings II magazine, noting the well-organized text layout of the game screens. One criticism was that the game's scoring algorithm was opaque and programmer-oriented. John Martellaro, in his review for Peelings II magazine, noted the game's educational merits, writing, \\"Terrorist is both a chilling and educational use of a microcomputer... It seems a good place for this program is in a college history or political science class.\\" Bruce Webster reviewed Terrorist in The Space Gamer No. 31. Webster commented that \\"The game is not cheap, but if you think you are interested at all in this topic, by all means get it. Just be careful who you play it with; like Diplomacy and other political games, you could lose some friends if they take the game too personally.\\" References Category:1980 video games Category:Strategy video games Category:Apple II games Category:Apple II-only games Category:Edu-Ware games Category:North America-exclusive video games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Terrorist (video game)"},{"id":"6894245","text":"Euryoryzomys nitidus, also known as the elegant oryzomysMusser and Carleton, 2005 or elegant rice rat, is a rodent species in the family Cricetidae. Previously it was known as Oryzomys nitidus, but it is not closely related to Oryzomys as that genus is now constructed. Its range includes Bolivia, Brazil and Peru to the east of the Andes, in lowland tropical rainforest as well as forest in the eastern foothills of the mountains, at elevations from . Description Elegant Rice Rat Euryoryzomys nitidus is a medium-sized rice rat with a head-and-body length of about and a similar length tail. The short dense fur on the head and back is tawny or tawny-brown, the sides of the head and flanks being tinged with ochre. The underparts are whitish-grey. The tail is a uniform colour apart from the underside near the tip which is mottled. The upper surfaces of both fore- and hind-feet are clad in white hair, and the nails are hidden by tufts of hair growing between them. Distribution and habitat The main population of E. nitidus is in the Andean foothills of Peru, Bolivia and western Brazil and adjoining lowlands. However outlying individuals have been identified at scattered locations in south-central Brazil, Paraguay and northeastern Argentina. In the upper Amazon basin, this species shares its range with the closely related Euryoryzomys macconnelli.Musser, G.G., Carleton, M.D., Brothers, E.M. and Gardner, A.L. 1998.

Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History 236:1–376. Its altitudinal range is between about and its typical habitat is tropical and sub-tropical rainforest. It also occurs in secondary forest and seems able to tolerate a considerable amount of habitat degradation. Other places where it has been recovered include primary and secondary dry deciduous forests, riverine gallery forests, savannah with palm trees, swamp forests and the environs of villages, among cropland, pasture and sporting venues. It is also present in the foothills of an isolated massif in Mato Grosso do Sul on the western border of the Pantanal. It is a terrestrial species. Andes Hantavirus variant A study of small rodents in Peru found that E. nitidus is the fourth most frequently caught species, with 35 individuals trapped out of a total of 362 rodents; six of this total harboured a hantavirus variant, IgG, including an adult male E. nitidus. Hantaviruses can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the human population, and although the occurrence of this syndrome is currently low, when it occurs, this zoonotic disease is often fatal. Status E. nitidus is a common species with a wide distribution. It is present in a number of protected areas and no particular threats to the species have been identified. For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

Written by John Enbom and directed by Michael Fields, the episode premiered on The CW on November 17, 2006. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a college student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica investigates an accusation that she plagiarized a criminology paper only to find out that her teacher is having an affair with Mindy O'Dell (Jamie Ray Newman). Meanwhile, Stosh \\"Piz\\" Piznarski (Chris Lowell) invites Veronica to go bowling, and Wallace Fennel (Percy Daggs III) must choose between basketball and his studies. The episode features the return of Laura San Giacomo as Harmony Chase and the introduction of the recurring character of Max (Adam Rose). San Giacomo and Colantoni, who had previously co-starred on the sitcom Just Shoot Me!, lobbied for more storylines together after rekindling their friendship during production of \\"Charlie Don't Surf\\", her first appearance. Rose's character had been planned to begin a later romantic relationship with Mac since the writing of this episode and went on to fulfill this role in several future episodes. At the time of its initial broadcast, the episode was watched by 2.75 million people and received mixed to positive reviews from television critics.  Plot  Following the events of the previous episode, Veronica confronts Claire Nordhouse (Krista Kalmus) for faking her rape after she publishes a story on it. Wallace Fennel and a lawyer are taken in to Dean O’Dell’s (Ed Begley, Jr.) office, where he is caught for cheating on a test. Veronica’s criminology paper is praised by her teacher, Hank (Patrick Fabian) leading her to praise him incessantly. Harmony Chase (Laura San Giacomo), a former client who asked Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni) to investigate her possibly adulterous husband, calls him and asks him on a date. Tim Foyle (James Jordan), Hank's teaching assistant, tells Veronica that she plagiarized her paper, even though she did not. Hank gives her three days to prove that she is innocent. Veronica learns that a student named Jeff Ratner accused her. Veronica goes to a computer student and ascertains the email address of the person who faked her paper. Stosh \\"Piz\\" Piznarski invites Veronica bowling, and she invites Parker (Julie Gonzalo) as well. Veronica gets caught snooping in the Dean’s office, although she makes up a hasty lie that she was searching for a lost earring, and it diverts his attention. Wallace decides not to drop the class on whose test he cheated. Veronica proves that the essay hers was supposedly plagiarized from was posted after she turned in her paper; nevertheless, she still wants to find who framed her. Parker, Veronica, Piz, and Logan (Jason Dohring) bowl and have fun together. When Veronica and Logan get room service, Veronica spots Jeff Ratner and questions him. Parker is romantically interested in Piz, and she tasks Veronica with talking to him about her. After talking to Mercer Hayes (Ryan Devlin), Parker informs Veronica that she remembers Mercer's cologne from the night of her rape. Veronica goes to Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) with this news; Wallace drops basketball to study for the class. Veronica runs into Keith at the hotel before learning that the room that belongs to \\"Rory Finch\\" is actually Hank, who is having an affair with Mrs. O’Dell. On their second date, Harmony suggests that they have sex, but Keith declines the proposal. On the way back, Keith’s becomes involved in a traffic collision, but the airbag catches him. This traumatic experience makes him go back to Harmony, and they sleep together. Veronica talks to Tim Foyle, who made her follow the trail of \\"Rory Finch\\" deliberately in order for her to discover the professor’s affair. Tim was the professor’s protégé, and he wants Veronica to discover Hank's flaws before she becomes more involved with him. Logan runs up to Veronica and tells her that Mercer has been arrested for the rapes on campus, despite the fact that he believes that Mercer is innocent. Logan begs Veronica to defend Mercer, as he was with him the night of one of the rapes. However, he refuses to tell Veronica what they were doing.  Production  \\"Hi, Infidelity\\" was written by John Enbom and directed by Michael Fields, marking Enbom's twelfth writing credit and Fields's sixth directing credit for the series. The episode features the second of three appearances by Laura San Giacomo as Harmony Chase. She and Enrico Colantoni had become friends when they co-starred on the sitcom Just Shoot Me!. They rekindled their friendship during production of \\"Charlie Don't Surf\\", San Giacomo's first appearance, so they lobbied for more storylines together. Thomas was open to the possibility, saying, \\"I wouldn't hesitate to go back to this, because I was really happy with how it played out.\\" Adam Rose made his first appearance in this episode as a suspect; he would make appearances later in the season as well. From the very beginning of his appearances, Rose's character, Max, was planned to begin a romantic relationship with Mac (Tina Majorino). Rose was roommates with Michael Mitchell, who played Bronson, another love interest for Mac. When Rose received the call that he would have a romantic storyline with Mac, he reportedly stated, \\"but I thought that's what my roommate was doing.\\"  Reception  Several reviewers praised the increased role of Piz (Chris Lowell, pictured) in the episode.  Ratings  At the time of its initial broadcast, \\"Hi, Infidelity\\" was viewed by 2.75 million people, ranking 94th out of 97 in the weekly rankings.  Reviews  Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10, indicating that it was \\"good\\", but his review was mixed. Comparing it with the rest of the season, he opined that it suffered from some of the same problems of previous episodes. He thought that the actions of many of the characters in \\"Hi, Infidelity\\" were out of character or unrealistic. While writing that \\"the rape storyline is still not feeling nearly as weighty as it should,\\" he praised the development of the rape mystery for hinting that there were larger forces at work. Price Peterson of TV.com gave a positive review, praising the case-of-the-week's emotional connection to Veronica for \\"[raising] the stakes\\" and Piz's increased role. He also believed that all the series regulars, excluding Wallace, had an important and interesting role to play. Television Without Pity gave the episode an \\"A\\", which is one of its highest ratings given for the season. Alan Sepinwall praised the episode compared to the first few episodes of the season, writing it balanced Veronica's character traits well, including her jealousy and generosity. He also wrote that it showed her as a character with some \\"baser instincts\\", giving the scene with Jeff as an example. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, gave a mixed review. The reviewer was very critical of what he called the \\"'radical feminist fakes her own rape'\\" storyline, but he praised the episode as the first one of the third season to make the college setting feel natural. Although he thought that the case-of- the-week contributed to his overall positive view of the episode, he thought that \\"it's mostly the little things that make it work\\", pointing out Piz's increased role as an example.

Mammals of the World: A checklist. Yale University Press, 312 pp. is a species of rodent in the family Cricetidae. It is a member of the genus Euryoryzomys, which was split off from Oryzomys in 2006. It was first described by Johann Andreas Wagner in 1848. It is found in southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and northeastern Argentina. It is considered a large species in its genus, with a reddish-brown coat, long tail length, and large skull. It is a terrestrial rodent, spending its time foraging for seeds, fruits, and insects. It is listed by the IUCN as least concern, although studies have shown it to be influenced by anthropogenic disturbances. Predators consist of small members of the order Carnivora.  Etymology  The prefix eury- comes from the Greek word 'eurys' meaning \\"wide\\" or \\"broad\\". The specific epithet russatus comes from the Latin word 'russatus', meaning \\"clothed in red\\".  Taxonomy  Euryoryzomys russatus (Wagner, 1848) is the currently accepted name for the russet rice rat. It is a member of the order Rodentia and family Cricetidae with the genus Euryoryzomys comprising six valid species.  Distribution and habitat  Euryoryzomys russatus is found in continental Brazil and outlying islands. This species is also found in Bolivia, Argentina, and Paraguay. It is found along altitudinal gradients consisting of lowland and mountainous (montane) areas. It is found in the Atlantic Forest as well as some areas of the Amazon rainforest. Specific locations where E. russatus has been collected include: Desterro Environmental Conservation Unit central Santa Catarina Island, Brazil (live specimens); Alem Paraiba, Minas Gerais, Brazil (museum specimens); Guaricana National Park, Paraná, Brazil (museum specimens); Ilha do Cardoso, São Paulo, Brazil (museum specimens); Parana, Southern Brazil (genetic identification from scat of predatory felines); Picinguaba, São Paulo, Brazil (live specimens); Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (live specimens);Costa, M.A.R., Maldonado Jr, A., Bóia, M.N., Lucio, C.S. & Simões, R.O. 2014. a new species of Hassalstrongylus (Nematoda: Heligmonelidae) from Euryoryzomys russatus (Rodentia: Sigmodontinae) in the Atlantic forest, Brazil. Neotropical Helminthology, vol. 8, n°2, jul-dec, pp. 235-242. Morro Grande Forest Reserve, São Paulo, Brazil (live specimens). This species is considered a forest specialist, dwelling only in habitats that have extensive forest canopy cover.Püttker, T. A. A. Bueno, C. Santos de Barros, S. Sommer, R. Pardini. 2013. Habitat specialization interacts with habitat amount to determine dispersal success of rodents in fragmented landscapes, Journal of Mammalogy, Volume 94, Issue 3, 11:714–726, https://doi.org/10.1644/12-MAMM-A-119.1 Abundance and immigration rates have been shown to increase as forest coverage increases.  Life history  Dorsal view of cranium  Morphology  The genus Euryoryzomys is described as having pelage that varies from yellow in color to a red-brown dorsally, while having a lighter ventral color.Weksler, M.; Percequillo, A. R.; Voss, R. S. (2006-10-19). \\"Ten new genera of oryzomyine rodents (Cricetidae: Sigmodontinae)\\" (PDF). American Museum Novitates. American Museum of Natural History. 3537: 1–29. The ears are typically medium to large. Vibrissae (whiskers) do not extend past the ears. Most species possess a jugal (with the exception of E. lamia). Euryoryzomys russatus is described as having a large skull and relatively large body length; with a body length range of . Weights have been recorded in some studies, and averaged .Naxara, L., Pinotti, B., & Pardini, R. (2009). Seasonal Microhabitat Selection by Terrestrial Rodents in an Old-Growth Atlantic Forest. Journal of Mammalogy, 90(2), 404–415. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/30224486 The tail averages between in length. Pelage of the rice rat is a reddish-brown on the dorsal portion of the body and white on the ventral portion. The pinnae and tail are both grey in color. The fore and hindlimbs are a pale pink, along with the nose. The facial vibrissae are black in color. Parietals in E. russatus possess no lateral expansions.  Ecology  Euryoryzomys russatus is a nocturnal, terrestrial rodent that moves primarily over leaf litter found on the forest floor.Ricardo S. Bovendorp, Jessica A. Laskowski and Alexandre R. Percequillo 2016. A first view of the unseen: nests of an endangered Atlantic Forest rat species. Mammalia (Short Note): 1-4. DOI 10.1515/mammalia-2015-0178 A seasonal microhabitat selection study found variation in microhabitat choice in warm- wet and cool-dry seasons. Euryoryzomys russatus was shown to have greater abundance in areas with woody debris, low leaf litter height, and high arthropod biomass during the warm-wet season and during the cool-dry season the greatest abundance was seen in areas with high leaf litter humidity. It is an opportunistic eater, consuming seeds, fruit, and insects when possible.Powers AM, Mercer DR, Watts DM, Guzman H, Fulhorst CF, Popov VL and Tesh RB (1999) Isolation and genetic characterization of a hantavirus (Bunyaviridae: Hantavirus) from a rodent, Oligoryzomys microtis (Muridae), collected in northeastern Peru Am J Trop Med Hyg 61:92–98Bergallo, H. & Magnusson, W. (2004). Factors affecting the use of space by two rodent species in Brazilian Atlantic forest. Mammalia. 68. 121-132. 10.1515/mamm.2004.013. A study of seed predation in the Brazilian Atlantic forest found E. russatus to be an efficient seed predator, eating a majority of seeds offered (with an exception to those with a mass greater than that of the observed individuals). A study of the population dynamics of a population of E. russatus on Santa Catarina Island in southern Brazil showed them to have nearly equal sex ratios. Populations of E. russatus have been shown to have a monogamous mating system.Antunes, P., Campos, M., Oliveira-Santos, L., & Graipel, M. (2009). Population dynamics of Euryoryzomys russatus and Oligoryzomys nigripes (Rodentia, Cricetidae) in an Atlantic forest area, Santa Catarina Island, Southern Brazil. Biothemes, 22 (2), 143-151. doi: https://doi.org/10.5007/2175-7925.2009v22n2p143 Females show reproductive activity throughout the year, and correlate with availability of food resources. The nests of E. russatus are cup-shaped, and built with fibers from bamboo and other grasses from the family Poaceae. Offspring are born altricial, lacking hair, and with eyes and ears closed. A study tracking individuals of E. russatus calculated the average number of offspring per pregnancy (from survey of pregnant females and nestlings) to be 3.6, with three to six nestlings being typical.  Genetics  Genetic analyses have grouped different populations of E. russatus into three clades using mitochondrial and nuclear gene regions, however no subspecies have been identified. A study focused on the genetic structuring of populations in the Atlantic Rain Forest of southern Brazil found no genetic structuring throughout the species distribution. Through karyotyping of E. russatus individuals from Parque Estadual da Serra do Mar (Santa Virginia, Brazil) it was found that they possess a chromosome number of 2n=80. This number is shared with E. emmonsae and E. nitidus.  Conservation  Euryoryzomys russatus is listed as a species of least concern by the IUCN as of September 2016. However, studies have shown this species to be susceptible to anthropogenic disturbances such as habitat degradation or destruction.Pardini R, Souza SM, Braga-Neto R, Metzger JP (2005) The role of forest structure, fragment size and corridors in maintaining small mammal abundance and diversity in an Atlantic forest landscape. Biol Conserv 124:253–266 Umetsu F, Pardini R (2007) Small mammals in a mosaic of forest remnants and anthropogenic habitats evaluating matrix quality in an Atlantic forest landscape. Landscape Ecol 22:517–530  Predators  Studies have found the E. russatus to be a prey item of several neotropical feline species including jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus) and ocelot (Leopardus pardalis). Domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) have also been shown to prey on E. russatus.  Parasites  Example of Trichomonas sp. similar to that found in E. russatus Research into the gastrointestinal parasites of E. russatus found eight different endoparasites in island and continental populations. A new species of nematode, Hassalstrongylus luquei, was found in the small intestine of E. russatus. A single individual was found to possess antibodies from a systemic fungal infection with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. A study on Rickettsia rickettsii, Brazilian Spotted-fever has shown E. russatus to be a host for the tick species Amblyomma ovale, which is a known vector for the zoonotic disease.

The game was followed by Rise of the Kasai, which was released in April 2005.  Background  With an art team consisting mostly of former 2D animators, The Mark of Kri offered a juxtaposition of cartoonish character designs and graphic violence while employing a unique visual style influenced by various Polynesian cultures and art, as well as the game's plot taking place in a Polynesian-influenced fantasy setting, and Maori mythology. The game also featured elements of adaptive music, with techniques developed specifically for the game, and \\"incredibly tight synchronization [with] on-screen state changes.\\"  Plot  The story begins with Rau Utu, a great and noble warrior in a new generation of warrior protectors of the bearers of the Marks of Kri called the Rakus, trained by his mentor, adopted father, and the last of the older generation of the Rakus, Baumusu. Accompanied during his adventure by a raven, Kuzo, his chronicler and narrator of the story, he was taught stealth and extraordinary skill with his sword. He was also taught to be a hero to help those in need rather than act as a mercenary. Rau was being asked for a favor by the village innkeeper, Rongo, from the north of Tapuroku, who says that bandits are keeping business away and asks Rau to look into it. After Rau takes care of the bandits, news of his prowess as a warrior and his heroics spread far and wide. This leads to a mysterious man showing up in the tavern, who offers Rau money for his services. Despite the uneasy feeling that Rau has about the man and Baumusu's suspicions regarding the necromancer, he accepts his offer. He then travels to the forest of Heiadoko, where he retrieves a piece of parchment from the tomb of Sambu-usu. This parchment, however, is actually one of the Marks of Kri - human skin. Rau returns home from his job to find that he's been taken advantage of by the mysterious man known simply as the \\"Dark One\\". The man later revealed turns out to be the Ganguun Priest, a member of an evil organization, the Kasai, and is devoted to its efforts to rule the world, as well as subverting Rau's true destiny. Furthermore, Rau then is told by an elderly woman, the fortune teller, that the money Rau received from him was a counterfeit, a curse marked by the Kasai. He then is told to head north to a place called Vaitaku, to find a tree and eat its fruit, knowing that this special tree is an oracle. After Rau eats the sacred fruit, the oracle tree informs him both of the Mark of Kri, and his destiny to protect a captured boy. The boy, the oracle says, holds the fifth mark, which the \\"Dark One\\" will soon have in his twisted possession. Furthermore, it is revealed that Rau not only has a great destiny, but will be among the gods, as his name will be used and whispered to quiet the children on stormy nights, and songs will be sung and written in his name. Finally, Rau is told that the sixth and final mark is well protected. He then travels to the heavily guarded temple of Meifiti, to save a boy from being sacrificed. However, when Rau reaches the boy, he is already sacrificed by the Dark One, directly leading him to a trap, designed by the Dark One himself. Upon returning to the Inn, Rau discovers that his village has been attacked and destroyed as part of his devious trap. When he discovered the carnage the Kasai had wrought, Baumusu, tells him of his path in life, and that Rau must find his sister, Tati, who has the final Mark of Kri, had been taken during the attack on the village, before dying as a great noble warrior and as a Rakus. As Rau's soul and heart demanded vengeance for Baumusu's death and his village's destruction at the hands of the Kasai, he travels to Rahtutusai, and encounters the Dark One. After Rau defeats his horde of Zombies and the Kasai troops, the Dark One asks him to join him on his quest for world domination. Rau declines by throwing an axe at the Dark One's head, killing him, avenging the deaths of Baumusu, the innkeeper, the destruction of his village, and succeeds in rescuing Tati at the end. However, there was more work to be done between them, according to Kuzo, that Rau and Tati, now vowed to confront an old enemy long forgotten, and save the Three Kingdoms from world domination at the hands of the Kasai. \\"But all of this is a different story, for another time.\\" Kuzo said before flying away.  Gameplay  The game makes use of the DualShock 2's analog sticks. The left is used for movement and the right for locking on to surrounding enemies.The Mark of Kri Instruction Manual Reception The Mark of Kri received favorable reviews upon release, as GameRankings gave it a score of 81.46%, while Metacritic gave it 80 out of 100. The game was given a score of 8.5 out of 10 and awarded Game of the Month in the August 2002 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly. Entertainment Weekly gave the game an A and called it \\"the most surprising, and visionary, action-adventure game of the summer.\\" Maxim gave it a score of 8 out of 10 and stated that \\"As an engrossing adventure, Kri doesn’t cut very deep, but where quick, visceral payoffs are concerned, it goes straight for the jugular.\\" However, The Cincinnati Enquirer gave it a score of three-and-a-half stars out of five and said the game was \\"a little on the short side (about 10 hours to complete or so) but does prove to be a fun fantasy romp for those who prefer action, stealth and attractive visuals.\\" The Mark of Kri aroused some controversy in New Zealand, where some regarded Sony as having made culturally insensitive use of elements of Māori culture in the design of the game.

Thereafter, he adopted Vaishnavism as a disciple of Ramananda, and later preached Nirguni (god without attributes) beliefs of life. Bhagat Pipa is considered one of the earliest influential sants of the Bhakti movement in 15th century northern India. Life Pipa (rightmost) with other Bhagats of Sikhism, Ravidas, Kabir and Namdev. Pipa was born into a Rajput royal family (Kshatriya varna) at Gagaron, in the present-day Jhalawar district of Rajasthan. He became the king of Gagaraungarh. Pipa worshipped the Hindu goddess Durga Bhavani and kept her idol in a temple within his palace. While Pipa was the king Gagaraungarh, he abdicated and became a 'sanyasi' and accepted Ramananda as his guru. He then joined Ramananda's Vaishnavism Bhakti, a movement with a strong monist emphasis based out of Varanasi.Ronald McGregor (1984), Hindi literature from its beginnings to the 19th century, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, , pages 42-44 According to Bhaktamal, a Bhakti movement hagiography, his wife, Sita, stayed with him before and after his abdication when he became a wandering monk.Winnand Callewaert (2000), The Hagiographies of Anantadas: The Bhakti Poets of North India, Routledge, , pages 277-278 The hagiography mentions many episodes of his sannyasa life, such as one where robbers tried to steal his buffalo that provided milk to his companions. When he stumbled into the robbery in progress, he began helping the robbers and suggested that they should take the calf.Winnand Callewaert (2000), The Hagiographies of Anantadas: The Bhakti Poets of North India, Routledge, , page 285 The robbers were so touched that they abandoned their ways and became Pipa's disciples. In his later life, Bhagat Pipa, as with several other disciples of Ramananda such as Kabir and Dadu Dayal, shifted his devotional worship from saguni Vishnu avatar (Dvaita, dualism) to nirguni (Advaita, monism) god, that is, from god with attributes to god without attributes. His date of birth and death is unknown, but the traditional genealogy in Bhakti hagiography suggests he died in 1400 CE. Key teachings and influence Pipa taught that God is within one's own self, and that true worship is to look within and have reverence for God in each human being.

When Mendanbar arrives, he finds Kazul's princess/assistant Cimorene at the cave but Kazul away. After Mendanbar gets over his preconceived notions about \\"empty-headed princesses\\" (having run into one himself earlier that day), Cimorene is able to identify the scales as coming from Woraug, a dragon who had conspired with wizards to make himself King and had been turned into a toad for his un-dragonlike behavior. Mendanbar and Cimorene then find Antorell, the son of Head Wizard of the Society of Wizards Zemenar, trying to sneak into Kazul's cave. Antorell, not knowing that Mendanbar is present, says that the King of the Enchanted Forest is preparing for war with the dragons. Mendanbar then fights Antorell, Cimorene eventually melting him by pouring a bucket of soapy water with lemon juice all over him. Cimorene then tells Mendanbar that Kazul has been in the north negotiating with Frost Giants, but is overdue coming home, and that Mendanbar had interrupted Cimorene right when she had been about to leave to begin searching for Kazul. Mendanbar refuses to allow Cimorene to travel alone, on the grounds that she will be traveling through part of the Enchanted Forest, and Mendanbar, as the king of the Enchanted Forest, knows how dangerous that is. Mendanbar and Cimorene travel to Flat Top Mountain to borrow a magic carpet from the giantess Ballimore, an acquaintance of Kazul. This succeeds, but troubles with the magic carpet force them down near the house of the dwarf Herman. Using one of the enchanted windows that Herman has in his house, Cimorene and Mendanbar discover that Kazul is being held captive by wizards in the Enchanted Forest. They immediately use Mendanbar's sword, a powerful magical implement that is intimately linked to the Enchanted Forest, to try to teleport back, but a problem with the spell dumps them in an unconnected ravine—also creating a small replica of the Enchanted Forest with the sword's magic. Mendanbar pulls the magic out of the replica and into the sword, thus unmaking the replica, and they meet Telemain, a magician who tells them that the charm on their magic carpet is wearing thin and recommends Gypsy Jack's for repair. Mendenbar is the only person who can understand Telemain. At Gypsy Jack's, they leave the carpet after meeting a wizard whose staff they capture but who gets away himself. They transport back to the Enchanted Forest—this time successfully—and go to the palace. On the way, they find that a wizard's staff will absorb all the magic from an area of the Enchanted Forest, thus leaving the area looking burned—just like Mendanbar had seen at the beginning of the book. At the palace, they find out where the wizards are and plan an expedition to the cave in which Kazul is being held. They fight briefly with the wizards and win, but they find that Kazul is still encased in the glowing bubble that imprisons her. Mendanbar ruptures the bubble with his sword, which absorbs wizards' magic, and frees Kazul. After going back to the castle, Mendanbar proposes to Cimorene, and they marry at the end of the story. Telemain also moves into the Enchanted Forest and sets up a magical spell that causes the magic of the forest to automatically get sucked out of the wizard's staffs if they attempt to steal the magic. Citation *Wrede, Patricia C. Searching for Dragons, Harcourt Brace, 1991, . Mendanbar, the young King of the Enchanted Forest, is puzzled about several burned spots where he found dragon scales, but, more significantly, he finds that the magical network that keeps the forest alive is mysteriously missing in every one of the burned spots.

His one hymn is present in Adi Granth Sahib, in Raga Bilaval.Page 858, Adi Granth The followers of Bhagat Sadhna are called Sadhna Panthis.A glossary of the tribes and castes of the Punjab and North-West, HA ROSE His only memorial is a mosque at Sirhind, where he died. Life history Early life Sadhna was born in 1180 AD in Sehwan Sharif in Hyderabad, Sindh province in a Muslim family. As his ancestors were butchers by profession, he continued the family profession of slaughtering goats (Dhabihah) and selling meat. It is said that there were shady trees and drinking water facility available near his shop. Due to this, in addition to customers, travelers, saints and even rogues used to take rest on passing. Sadhna was very interested in spirituality from his adolescence and as a result, he used to have spiritual discussions with such saints who stopped near his shop.Dr Joginder Singh Dhami's article on Bhagat Sadhna Shaligram desecration Sadhna got shaligram shilas and used them as weights in his profession. Sadhna annoyed vaishnav sadhus and pundits with this act. On one side, he was of lower profession and caste, and on the other, he was belittling their idol worship by using idol in the flesh of animals, which is consider as sin by the Pundits. Those religious scholars always argued and debated with him, in which Sadhna always outwitted them. It is recorded that one of vaishnav saint took shaligram stones with him. Sadhna had no issues with this and did not object. Vaishnav saint continued worshipping shaligram but got no internal pleasure and wisdom, as he had seen in state, behavior and thoughts of Sadhna. With dashing hopes he returned Shaligram Stones, the weights of Sadhna back.Bhagat Sadhna Ji, Dr Dharampal Singhal Sadhna preached that \\"Shaligrams Stones\\" are not god as these are lifeless stones, and can not give any wisdom to a living being. His spiritual quest led him to renounce the life of a householder. He left Sehvan and roamed about the country preaching the love of God. Dispute with Brahmin's lusty wife This historical account is from the time when Sadhna was young and good looking with a strong body. During his travels in North India, his looks pleased a young married Brahmin lady, who wanted to have sex with him. When she asked Sadhna, he replied that he could not have sexual relation with anyone out of his marriage. She thought Sadhna might be fearing her husband. Without understanding Sadhna thoughts, she killed her husband. Came back to Sadhna and told what she did. Sadhna got shocked and left the area after sermonizing her. The lady felt ashamed, she burnt herself on husband's funeral pyre, so that people continued thinking her to be Sati- Savitri.History of the sect of Mahĝrĝjas: or Vallabhĝchĝryas, in western India By Karsandás Múljí, Ralph T.

Another view existed that Brahmin's wife complained to local administration that Sadhna raped her. Sadhna was arrested and the magistrate sentenced Bhagat Sadhna to have his hands cut off. After the punishment was carried out, Bhagat Sadhna was discharged. He set out without a frown on his forehead notwithstanding his barbarous mutilation.

However, following their schism from mainstream Sikhs, the Ravidassi compiled their own holy book of Ravidass' teachings, the Amritbani Guru Ravidass Ji, and many Ravidassia temples now use this book in place of the Guru Granth Sahib.

The group began in 2001 as an informal network, but since 2004 it formally works as an association. Among its projects are art shows, dinner nights, performances, film nights, parties and political manifestations, as well as TV and radio shows. The name means odour or reek in Danish. Activities During 2003, Dunst handled the Gay House at Christiania. Events and parties in the revived Gay House were popular among Copenhagen's gays, but Dunst allegedly received complaints and threats from Christiania residents and subsequently moved out of Christiania.History of Dunst (in Danish)Dunst's letter to Christiania's weekly magazine, 26 May 2004 (in Danish) During 2003 Dunst broadcast six episodes of its own TV show on Kanal København, a local Copenhagen television network. The network, however, declined to air an episode showing one artist eating excrement and subsequently banned Dunst from its facilities. Dunst currently broadcasts a weekly radio show on the local cable network. Dunst has made events in neighbouring countries and has gained some international attention, notably in Berlin. Style and context Dunst is known for its bizarre and ironic drag queen personalities (including such names as Ramona Macho, Miss Fish, Puta and Tove Hansen) and music performers such as the band Nuclear Family. Having decidedly anti-establishment aims, the group has a humorous approach with a drag-punk flavour. Public appearances have been referred in several mainstream media which would otherwise often ignore gay events.Dunst press referrals The attitude of Dunst appears more sarcastic and less militant than radical queer punk formations in other countries. It could be claimed that Dunst combines a postmodern appearance with a Danish tradition of humorous political activism. During the 1970s and 1980s, the theatre group Solvognen (Sun Chariot, linked with Christiania), singers Troels Trier and Rebecca Brüel, and the squatter performance network Kulørte Klat (\\"Coloured Blob\\") made imaginative and ironic performances, as well as feminist groups of rødstrømper (literally \\"Redstockings\\").

It lies approximately 140 km northwest of Mombasa and 380 km southeast of Nairobi. The County headquarters are located in Mwatate, which is central to the county. The population of the county was 340,671 persons according to the 2019 national census, with population densities ranging from 14 persons per km2 to more than 117 persons per km2. This is due to the varied rainfall and terrain with the lower zones receiving an average 440 mm of rain per annum and the highland areas receiving up to 1,900 mm of rain. The county ranges in altitude from 500 m above sea level to 2,228 m at Vuria Peak, which is the county's highest point. Land Use The county covers an area of 17,083.9 km2, of which 62% or 11,100 km2, is within Tsavo East and Tsavo West National Parks. The remaining 5,876 km2 consists of small scale farms, ranches, sisal estates, water bodies (such as Lakes Chala and Jipe in Taveta and Mzima springs), and the hilltop forests. The lowland areas of the county outside the national parks are farms, ranches, estates, and wildlife sanctuaries. The county has approximately 25 ranches. The main land use in the ranches is cattle grazing. The three operating sisal estates in the county are Teita Sisal Estate, Voi Sisal Estate and Taveta Sisal Estate. Many ranches have ventured into wildlife tourism and conservation. The Taita Hills and Saltlick Lodges sanctuary is among the well known tourism attractions in Taita Taveta. There are 48 forests which have survived on hill tops in the county of which 28 are gazetted and are under government protection and management. They range in size from small 500 square metre patches with a few remnant trees to modestly vast 2 square kilometer indigenous and exotic forest mountains. These forests are part of the unique Eastern Arc range of forests found mostly in eastern Tanzania with the Taita Hills forming the only Kenyan portion of that forest type. The Taita Hills forest hold a unique biodiversity with 13 taxa of plants and 9 taxa of animals found only in the Taita Hills and nowhere else in the world. In addition, 22 plant species found in the Taita Hills forests are typical of the Eastern Arc forests. Within these beautiful indigenous forests, bubbles clean water flowing to the lowland areas catering for both human economic activities and wildlife.  Human - Wildlife Conflict  As the Tsavo National Park covers approximately two-thirds of the land area of Taita Taveta County, growth in human population causes conflict with wildlife. The national population census carried out in 1969 put the number of persons in the then Taita Taveta district at 110,742. The Kenya Population and Housing Census of August 2019 found that the number of people in Taita Taveta county was 340,671 representing an increase of 207.6% in fifty years. The growth of the human population means that land close to the park boundaries is converted from bush land into settlements. Consequently, people have been killed by wildlife, as others lose crops and livestock. The national government has a mechanism for financially compensating families for wildlife-related deaths and destruction of property, but residents of Taita Taveta say the process of claiming compensation is too tedious. A television news report broadcast in September 2018 revealed that only ten out of more than 1,500 claims for compensation in Taita Taveta County had been paid out in the previous five years.

Volume 1\\", Adamant Media Corporation, , pp. 62-63), first Lord of the Manor of Philipseborough (Philipsburg) and patriarch of the Philipse family, was a Dutch immigrant to North America of Bohemian heritage.(William Jay, The Life of John Jay: with selection of his correspondence and miscellaneous papers. New York: J. & J Harper, 1833, p. 10). On his Bohemian aristocratic ancestry, see also: Thomas Capek, Ancestry of Frederick Philipse: First Lord and Founder of Philipse Manor at Yonkers, N. Y. New York: The Paebar Co., 1939. A merchant, he arrived in America as early as 1653. In 1662 he engaged in a marriage to a wealthy and driven widow, Margaret Hardenbrook de Vries. Together, and variously in league with slavers, pirates, and other undesirables, the couple combined their industry to amass a fortune. Beginning in 1672 Philipse and some partners started acquiring land in what was to become lower Westchester County, New York. When the British took over the Dutch colony in 1674, Philipse pledged his allegiance to the Crown and was rewarded with a title and manorship for his holdings, which ultimately grew to some (210 km²). Serving later on the Governor's executive council, he was subsequently banned from government office for conducting a slave trade into New York. Upon his death, Philipse was one of the greatest landholders in the Province of New York. He owned the vast stretch of land spanning from Spuyten Duyvil Creek, in the Bronx (then in lower Westchester County), to the Croton River. He was regarded by some as the richest man in the Colony. His son Adolphus acquired substantial land north of modern Westchester sanctioned as the royal Philipse Patent. Stripped from the family after the Revolution for their Tory sympathies, the some tract became the present-day Putnam County, New York. Biography Map of Philipsburg Manor with current borders overlaid on the property Frederick Philipse emigrated from the Friesland area of the Netherlands to Flatbush, New Netherland, on Long Island, and began his career by selling iron nails then rose to become an owner of taverns. The land that would become Philipsburg Manor was first bought from Adriaen van der Donck, who had invested in an unsuccessful Dutch patroonship in New Netherland before the English takeover in 1664. Frederick Philipse I, Thomas Delavall, and Thomas Lewis purchased the first tracts of land in 1672 in current-day northern Yonkers. Philipse made several additional purchases between 1680 and 1686 from the Wiechquaeskeck and Sintsink Indian tribes, expanding the property to both the north and south; he also bought a small plot of land from the Tappans west of the Hudson River. Philipse also bought out his partners' stakes during this time, enticing friends from New Amsterdam and Long Island to move with him with the promise of free land and limited taxes. The manor grew to around , about (210 km²), comprising much of today's lower Westchester County, New York. The estate's boundaries were the Spuyten Duyvil Creek, the Croton River, the Hudson River, and the Bronx River. Philipse was granted a royal charter in 1693, creating the Manor of Philipsburg, and making him first lord of the manor. Along with the three other main manors of the colony—Rensselaerswyck, Cortlandt, and Livingston—Philipsburg created one of the richest and most powerful families in the colony. After swearing allegiance to the English and later being granted his manorship from them, he built in 1693 the first bridge connecting New York City with the mainland, erecting King's Bridge over the Spuyten Duyvil at Marble Hill. He also began construction of the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow. Although this project had financing, work likely progressed slowly and was completed in 1685. Philipse built a simple residence in today's Getty Square neighborhood of Yonkers, New York near the confluence of the Nepperhan River with the Hudson. Later it was expanded by his descendants into a full-fledged mansion, Philipse Manor Hall. The neighborhood of Kingsbridge, Bronx, is named for his bridge over the Harlem River. In 1685 Philipse imported about 50 slaves directly from Angola on his own ship. He was also an interloper, trading to the east of the Cape of Good Hope, and becoming a known trading partner of Madagascar pirate- merchant Adam Baldridge, employing traders like Thomas Mostyn and John Thurber to make the New York-to-Madagascar voyages. In the 1690s, Baldridge supplied many of the slaves traded and owned by the Philipse family; in return Philipse sent Baldridge guns, alcohol, and other supplies much in demand by pirates. Philipse was on the Governor's executive council from 1691 to 1698, when he was banned from government office by the British governor, Lord Bellomont, for conducting a slave trade into New York. Philipse died in 1702 and is buried with his two wives in the crypt of the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow. Family Philipse Manor Hall, the Lower Mills manor house The Philipse family is of Bohemian origin. According to Supreme Court Justice John Jay, (whose maternal grandmother, Eva de Vries, had been adopted by Frederick Philipse upon his marriage to Margaret Hardenbroeck de Vries): \\"Frederick Philipse, whose family, originally of Bohemia, had been compelled by popish persecution to take refuge in Holland, from whence he had emigrated to New York.\\" By another account, Philipse was the son of Vicount Philipse Savery, Florence M., Cold Springs Recorder, 1912 Spellings of Philipse varied in the New World, among them: F-l-y-p-s-e, F-i-y-p-s-e-n, V-i-y-p-s-e, Y-i-y-p-s-e-n of Bohemia and Margaret Dacres, supposed to have been a lady of good family from the parish of Dacre, England Philipse had eleven children with his first wife, Margaret:Morris, F.O., Philipse of Philipsburgh, in The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, vol. 10 (1856) Married 1662, name listed as \\"Philipszen\\", New York Genealogical & Biographical Record (quarterly), 1875, selected extracts Philip Philipse,Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site: Philip Philipse, oldest son of Frederick Philipse I, and his wife, Mary, both died in Barbados in 1689 (on September 14 and October 18, respectively).

A year later, Frederick married the widow Catharine Van Cortlandt Derval, who survived him for many years.Glenn, p. 258: Her will is dated 7th January, 1730 Glenn, Thomas Allen, ‘’Some colonial mansions and those who lived in them: With genealogies of the various families mentioned’’, H.

Harrison, NJ: Harbor Hill Books, 1975. Jacobus and Eva's daughter, Mary, was the mother of John Jay by her marriage to Peter Jay. In 1697 Adolphus Philipse, Frederick's second son, purchased a tract from Dutch traders which received British Royal sanction as the Highland Patent. Subsequently, known as the \\"Philipse Patent\\", the roughly 250 square miles parcel extended eastward from the Hudson River at the northern border of Westchester County some 20 or so miles to the Colony of Connecticut.Smith, Philip Henry, General History of Putnam County: From 1609 to 1876, inclusive, published by the author, Pawling, NY, 1877, p. 44 The Hudson Highlands are among the scenic highlights of the Philipse Patent Philip Philipse, the eldest and heir to the Manor, hereditary title, and family commercial holdings, died in either 1699 or 1700.Morris, F.O., Philipse of Philipsburgh, in The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, vol. 10 (1856), p. 26: \\"PHILIP PHILIPSE, of Philipsbourg, born in 1656, who married, at Barbadoes, in 1697 (whither he had been sent by his father to an estate he had there, called Spring Head, and where he quickly recovered his health, having been before of a very delicate constitution), Maria, youngest of the four daughters of ? Sparkes, Esq., governor of Barbadoes, by Joyce, his wife, daughter of ? Farmer, Esq., (two of whom had retumed to their father's estate in Worcestershire, and the others accompanied their parents to the island), and, dying in 1700, left a son and successor. She also died in 1700.\\" By predeceasing his father, the legacy that would have gone to Philip bypassed him and was distributed between Adolphus and Philip's son, Frederick Philipse II. By the terms of Frederick Philipse's last will and testament, dated 26 October 1700, proved 1702, Adolphus received all the Manor north of Dobb's Ferry, including the present town. He was also named proprietor of a tract of land on the west bank of the Hudson north of Anthony's Nose and executor of Philip's estate.Glenn, p. 258: \\"By the will of Frederick Philipse \\"all that portion of the manor north of Dobb's Ferry, including the present town, became vested in Adolphus Philipse, his second son. This individual \\" was also proprietor\\" of a great tract of land north of \\" Anthony's Nose \\" and the executor of his brother Philip Philipse's estate, the latter having died in 1714. Adolphus died without issue in 1750, and the whole manor of Philipsborough descended to his nephew, Frederick Philipse, the nearest male heir of the grandfather. This nephew was born in 1698 upon the island of Barbadoes, at an estate called Springhead belonging to his father.\\" After the bachelor Adolphus' death in 1749 (Smith, others 1750), his Manor holdings and the Highland Patent passed to his nephew, Frederick Philipse II, his only heir-at-law, who became the second Lord of the Manor at Philipsborough.Philipse family history: \\"At the death of Frederick Philipse in 1751, the Highland Patent was inherited by his son, Philip Philipse, and three daughters, Susannah (wife of Beverly Robinson), Mary (late wife of Col. Roger Morris), and Margaret, who died intestate. Margaret's portion was, by terms of her father's will, equally divided among her brother and sisters, and in 1751, after a survey of the whole tract, it was geographically divided into nine Lots; three on the river; three in the interior; three on the eastern (Connecticut) border. Each of the three heirs inherited a lot in each division.\\"Pelletreau, William, S, History of Putnam County, New York - With Biographical Sketches of its Prominent Men, W.W. Preston & Company, Philadelphia, 1886 History of Putnam County, New York On Frederick II's death in 1751 all Manor holdings and the title went to his eldest son Frederick Philipse III, the third Lord of the Manner of Philipsburg. The Highland Patent - today's Philipse Patent - was divided among Frederick II's surviving offspring, son Philip Philipse, and daughters, Susannah (wife of Beverley Robinson), Mary (wife of Col. Roger Morris), and Margaret (who died intestate, her share being divided among the other three).French's Gazetteer of the State of New York (1860): \\"The Philipses Patent… divided among the remaining three [children] Philip… Susannah married to Beverly Robinson, and Mary married to Col. Roger Morris. On the 7th of Feb 1754, the patent was divided into 9 lots: 3, each 4 mi. square, bordering upon the Hudson and denominated ‘water lots;’ 3, each 4 mi. wide by 12 long, extending N. and S. across the patent, and denominated ‘long lots;’ 3, each 4 mi. square, upon the E. border denominated ‘back lots.’ Philip, Susannah and Mary Philipse each owned one of each kind of lots. Frederick III leased the entirety of his property to William Pugsley before siding with the British in the American Revolution and leaving New York City for England in 1783. After the Revolution, the entire Philipse holdings, including the Manor and other lands in today's Westchester County, and the Highland Patent, were seized by New York and sold by its Commissioners of Forfeitures. In all, the lands were divided up into almost 200 different parcels, with the vast majority of the Philipse Patent becoming today's Putnam County, and other large parcels going to Dutch New York businessman Henry Beekman.

He was elected Member of Parliament for the constituency at the 1885 general election, but lost it at the 1886 general election. After regaining the seat in the 1892 general election, he lost it again in the 1895 general election. A keen antiquarian, Sitwell worked on the Sacheverell papers, and wrote a biography of his ancestor, William Sacheverell and published The Letters of the Sitwells and Sacheverells. His collection of books and papers are said to have filled seven sitting-rooms at the family house, Renishaw Hall, in Derbyshire. He researched genealogy and heraldry, and was a keen designer of gardens (he studied garden design in Italy).Eccentric patriarch with slender grip on reality, Tim Harris, The Age, January 2003, accessed March 2010 In 1909 he purchased the Castello di Montegufoni, near Florence, then a wreck inhabited by three hundred peasants. Over the next three decades he restored it to its original design, commissioned the Italian painter Gino Severini to paint the murals, and took up permanent residence there in 1925, writing to the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to explain that taxes had forced him to settle in Italy. He remained in Italy at the outbreak of war, but in 1942 moved to Switzerland and died at Locarno at the age of 83. He held his baronetcy for 81 years 89 days, longer than all his three predecessors, and one of the longest times anyone has held a baronetcy in England.

Moon-Boy resembles a small, furry humanoid. He is best known as the constant companion of Devil Dinosaur. Publication history Being primarily a supporting character to Devil Dinosaur, Moon-Boy has yet to be the lead character in a comic book series of his own. His appearances in print have been invariably linked to the appearances of Devil Dinosaur. Moon-Boy made his debut in Devil Dinosaur #1 (April 1978) and was a continuing character in all nine issues of the series' run. Since the cancellation of the original Devil Dinosaur series, Moon-Boy's appearances have coincided with Devil Dinosaur's various cameo appearances, supporting roles, and one-shot comics. The team of Devil Dinosaur and Moon-Boy was created by artist Jack Kirby who scripted and penciled all issues of the first Devil Dinosaur series. Kirby's intent was for the duo to be inhabitants of Earth's prehistoric past as evidenced by a title on the cover of Devil Dinosaur #1 which proclaims Moon-Boy to be the \\"first human.\\" Some later writers of the characters retconned the pair to be mutants from an alien world, while more recent writers have written them as being from Dinosaur World (Earth-78411), a planet located in a parallel universe contained within the Marvel Multiverse.Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone and the Monster Hunters #1 (November 2005) Fictional character biography Moon-Boy was born into a tribe of intelligent, fur-covered, ape-like humanoids known as the \\"Small- Folk\\". The Small-Folk were hunter-gatherers that made their home in the \\"Valley of Flame\\", a region of numerous active volcanoes. Moon-Boy's connection with Devil Dinosaur began as a young boy when he came across a female dinosaur being attacked by a rival tribe known as the \\"Killer-Folk\\". The female was killed, as well as two of her three young. The third did not die however, but was transformed when the Killer-Folk attempted to burn him to death with their torches. The fire permanently scorched the young dinosaur's skin bright red. Moon-Boy cared for the orphaned creature after its ordeal and named him \\"Devil\\". Ostracized from his tribe because of his association with Devil, Moon-Boy and his red companion became wanderers.Devil Dinosaur #1 (April 1978) Devil and Moon-Boy's wanderings eventually took them to distant times and worlds. First, they encountered extraterrestrials.Devil Dinosaur #4-6 Next they encountered Godzilla, who had been transported to Moonboy and Devil Dinosaur's alternate Earth.Godzilla #21-22 In time, they encountered the Fallen Angels.Fallen Angels #4 They traveled to Earth, and temporarily took up residence with the Fallen Angels in New York City.Fallen Angels #5 After several trips to the modern era of Earth-616 via magic, time travel, and teleportation by mutants, the pair eventually settled in the Savage Land of Earth-616.Devil Dinosaur #9 (December 1978), Fallen Angels #4-8 (April - November 1987), Marvel Comics Presents #161 (August 1994), Marvel Comics Presents #174 (February 1995), Ghost Rider Vol. 3 #81-82 (January – February 1997), Amazing Spider-Man Annual 1998 While residing in the Savage Land, the forgotten world was invaded by the power hungry Roxxon Oil Company. Ka-Zar, ruler of the Savage Land, recruited Moon-Boy and Devil Dinosaur to help fight off the invasion, and Moon-Boy proved his worth as fighter during the following war.Marvel Comics Presents vol. 2 #5 (January 2008) Later, Moon-Boy became separated from Devil when he was removed from the Savage Land and taken to New York City by the Heroes for Hire mercenary team who were hired by S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists to retrieve the \\"Homo habilis\\" so that they might study his DNA.Heroes for Hire #9-11 (April - June 2007) Moon-Boy would remain under the custody of S.H.I.E.L.D. for some time, which drove Devil into a sort of saurian depression causing him to refuse to hunt or even to eat food given to him. This came to the attention of Stegron, the dinosaur man, who feared for the life of the beast, and left the Savage Land secretly to wage war upon S.H.I.E.L.D. Using an army of reanimated dinosaurs, Stegron attacked base after base searching for Moon-Boy, and was only stopped by the Fifty State Initiative. However, once learning the motive behind Stegron's attacks, the Initiative recruit Reptil, smuggled Moon-Boy out of the country and returned him to the Savage Land, where he was reunited with his companion.Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil #1 Moon-Boy and Devil Dinosaur frightened off a pair of Killer Folk to reclaim the Nightstone which the Killer Folk worshipped and had killed many Small Folk over. Devil Dinosaur chased away the Killer Folk while Moon-Boy took hold of the Nightstone with the intention of hiding it far away from the Killer Folk's grasp. However, a band of Killer Folk emerged from the trees and attacked Moon-Boy, beating him relentlessly with their fists to try to reclaim the Nightstone. At that moment the Nightstone disappeared due to a vortex opened by Lunella Lafayette (the future Moon Girl) and the Killer Folk went through in search of the Nightstone, leaving the brutalized Moon-Boy behind. Devil Dinosaur found his long-running companion as he died of his injuries. Moon-Boy expressed regret he would have to leave his friend and told him to hunt the Killer Folk through the vortex, stop them from getting the Nightstone and to avenge him. Moon-Boy succumbed to his wounds and died beneath a full moon as Devil Dinosaur went into the vortex to avenge him.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #1 Some time later, Devil and Moon Girl make use of a time machine to save Moon Boy moments before his death.Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur #23 Powers and abilities Moon-Boy has lifelong experience at foraging and general survival in the wild. He is somehow able to understand the guttural noises of his companion Devil Dinosaur as language. Moon-Boy has little experience with civilized culture and/or behavior. He is extremely hairy, with thick fur covering all but his palms, soles, and face. Moon-Boy often goes about unclothed; his thick pelt of animal-like hair provides sufficient protection from the elements.

Bhagat Sain was a barber of the royal court of Raja Ram, king of Rewa.Page 2750, The Indian Encyclopaedia: Gautami Ganga-Himmat Bahadur, Subodh Kapoor, Genesis Publishing Pvt Ltd, 2002Page 238, Selections from the Sacred Writings of the Sikhs, Orient Blackswan, 01-Jan-2000 Life The tendency of the age was towards devotion and religious composition, and Sain found leisure in the midst of duties to study the hymns of Ramanand, shape his life on the principles inculcated in them, and successfully imitate their spirit and devotional fervour. God is said by the Hindu chronicler to have cherished Sain as a cow her calf. He frequented the society of holy men and was very happy in their company. He performed for them all menial officies, for he believed that serving saints was equivalent to serving God himself. The Bhagat Mal contains a legend which at once illustrates Sain’s devotion to saints and the estimation in which he was held for his piety. When going one day to perform his usual ministrations for King Raja Ram, he met some holy men on the way. He thought it was his first duty to attend to them, He took them with him, and began to render them with the customary services. With the greatest mental satisfaction to himself he gave them consecrated and secular food to relieve their souls and bodies. In thus acting Sain disregarded his duty to the king and braved his displeasure. The legend states that a holy man, by God’s favour, in order to avert the king’s wrath and save Sain from punishment, assumed his appearance, and having gone and performed the customary duties for the king, took his departure. Soon after Sain arrived and began to apologise for the delay. The king said, “Thou hast only just gone after the usual services to me; why apologise?” Sain replied, “ I have not been here. Perhaps thy majesty sayest so to excuse my absence.” The Raja then knew that a special providence had intervened and performed for him the usual tonsorial duties. He was at once converted, fell at Sain’s feet, worshipped him as his guru, and thus sought an asylum in God.

Wrede, third in the Enchanted Forest Chronicles. Plot summary This novel is the third in the Enchanted Forest series, told from the witch Morwen's perspective. Morwen, a witch who lives in the Enchanted Forest, is having trouble with people who believe that magic should follow traditional forms, specifically one Arona Michealear Grinogion Vamist. Morwen's cats find a large rabbit named Killer as well as the burned-looking splotches that a wizard's staff leaves in the forest, despite the spell on the forest (established in the last book) that should prevent it. Morwen calls the magician Telemain to help, who mentions a wizard-melting spell he came up with. They then find the wizard Antorell (son of the Head wizard Zemanar), who is two inches tall, shrunken by his own spell, who tries to escape but is subdued by the cats and then melted by Telemain. Morwen then finds that Killer has eaten one of the magical cabbages in her garden, and has turned into a donkey. (Throughout the story, Killer acquires additional spells and changes form.) Morwen and Telemain immediately go to the castle of King Mendanbar and Queen Cimorene, who is pregnant. At the castle, Mendanbar and Telemain discover that the sword at the heart of the forest's magic is stolen, allowing the wizards free rein in the forest. Morwen, Kazul (the King of Dragons), Telemain, Cimorene, Killer and two of Morwen's cats must undertake the journey to the headquarters of the Society of Wizards, who stole the sword. Mendanbar stays in the Enchanted Forest to guard against wizards. Telemain teleports the group twice towards their destination. The next teleport fails and Telemain is unconscious. Killer carries Telemain as they make their way through a swamp. They find a tower occupied by a fire-witch, Brandel, who is there because Vamist chased his family out of their home. After Brandel lets them in, they use his magic mirror to try to contact Mendanbar but find that they cannot because of a problem at his end. Kazul decides to go home and find out what's happening. The next morning, again with Brandel's mirror, they find that the sword is not at the headquarters of the Society of Wizards as they assumed, but at the house of Vamist. With the help of the cats, Morwen and Cimorene manage to recover the sword (they melt Antorell again). Telemain teleports them back to the forest and the group realize that they accidentally brought Vamist along. While they were gone, a battle has occurred between the dragons and wizards. The wizards encased the castle in a magical bubble and Mendanbar is missing, presumed inside the castle. As with the bubble shield spell in Searching for Dragons, the only way to break it is with the sword of the King of the Enchanted Forest, and the only one who can wield the sword is the King or his heir. Morwen and Telemain move the spells on Killer onto Vamist, returning the rabbit to his natural form. Cimorene hides the sword in the forest so the wizards cannot find it. The dragons put up a second bubble around the castle, which only they can take down so that the wizards can't enter the castle either. Cimorene takes her baby and hides in an outer region of the forest to wait until the baby is old enough to use the sword and rescue Mendanbar.

The theory states that the nascent polypeptide forms initial secondary structure (ɑ-helices and β-strands) creating localized regions of predominantly hydrophobic residues. The polypeptide interacts with water, thus placing thermodynamic pressures on these regions which then aggregate or \\"collapse\\" into a tertiary conformation with a hydrophobic core. Incidentally, polar residues interact favourably with water, thus the solvent-facing surface of the peptide is usually composed of predominantly hydrophilic regions. Hydrophobic collapse may also reduce the affinity of conformationally flexible drugs to their protein targets by reducing the net hydrophobic contribution to binding by self association of different parts of the drug while in solution. Conversely rigid scaffolds (also called privileged structures) that resist hydrophobic collapse may enhance drug affinity. Partial hydrophobic collapse is an experimentally accepted model for the folding kinetics of many globular proteins, such as myoglobin, alpha-lactalbumin, barstar, and staphylococcal nuclease. However, because experimental evidence of early folding events is difficult to obtain, hydrophobic collapse is often studied in silico via molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations of the folding process. Globular proteins that are thought to fold by hydrophobic collapse are particularly amenable to complementary computational and experimental study using phi value analysis.  Biological significance  Correct protein folding is integral to proper functionality within biological systems. Hydrophobic collapse is one of the main events necessary for reaching a proteins stable and functional conformation. Proteins perform extremely specific functions which are dependent on their structure. Proteins that do not fold correctly are nonfunctional and contribute nothing to a biological system. Hydrophobic aggregation can also occur between unrelated polypeptides. If two locally hydrophobic regions of two unrelated structures are left near each other in aqueous solution, aggregation will occur. In this case, this can have drastic effects on the health of the organism. The formation of amyloid fibrils, insoluble aggregates of hydrophobic protein can lead to a myriad of diseases including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.The folding funnel theory of protein folding  Energetics  The driving force behind protein folding is not well understood, hydrophobic collapse is a theory, one of many, that is thought to influence how a nascent polypeptide will fold into its native state. Hydrophobic collapse can be visualized as part of the folding funnel model which leads a protein to its lowest kinetically accessible energy state. In this model, we do not consider the interactions of the peptide backbone as this maintains its stability in non-polar and polar environments as long as there is sufficient hydrogen bonding within the backbone, thus we will only consider the thermodynamic contributions of the side chains to protein stability. When placed in a polar solvent, polar side chains can form weak intermolecular interactions with the solvent, specifically hydrogen bonding. The solvent is able to maintain hydrogen bonding with itself as well as the polypeptide. This maintains the stability of the structure within localized segments of the protein. However, non-polar side chains are unable to participate in hydrogen bonding interactions. The inability of the solvent to interact with these side chains leads to a decrease in entropy of the system. The solvent can interact with itself, however the portion of the molecule in proximity to the non-polar side chain is unable to form any significant interactions, thus the dissociative degrees of freedom available to the molecule decreases and entropy decreases. By aggregating the hydrophobic regions, the solvent can reduce the surface area exposed to non- polar side chains, thus reduce localized areas of decreased entropy. While the entropy of the polypeptide has decreased as it enters a more ordered state, the overall entropy of the system increases, contributing to the thermodynamic favourability of a folded polypeptide. As can be seen in the folding funnel diagram, the polypeptide is at its highest energy state when unfolded in aqueous solution. As it forms localized folding intermediates, or molten globules, the energy of the system decreases. The polypeptide will continue folding into lower energy states as long as these conformations are kinetically accessible. In this case, a native conformation does not have to be at the lowest energy trough of the diagram as shown, it must simply exist in its natural and kinetically accessible conformation in biological systems. Top-down view of an alpha-helix showing the precedence of similarly polar residues on the same \\"face\\" of the helix running longitudinally. Surface structures Stylized cartoon showing the overall polarity of either side of an amphipathic alpha helix. One longitudinal side is nonpolar and interacts with the hydrophobic core of the peptide, while the polar side interacts with the polar solvent. The formation of a hydrophobic core requires the surface structures of this aggregate to maintain contact with both the polar solvent as well as the internal structures. In order to do this, these surface structures usually contain amphipathic properties. A surface exposed alpha helix may have nonpolar residues in an N+3, N+4 position, allowing the alpha- helix to express nonpolar properties on one side when split longitudinally along the axis. Note, in the diagram, the presence of non-polar(gold) amino acids along one side of the helix when viewed through the longitudinal axis, as well as charged/polar amino acids along the other face. This provides this structure with longitudinal amphipathic properties necessary for hydrophobic aggregation along the non-polar side. Similarly, beta strands can also adopt this property with simple alternation of polar and nonpolar residues. Every N+1 side chain will occupy space on the opposite side of the beta strand.

It is found in western Brazil, eastern Peru, Bolivia, and northern Paraguay. Description Oligoryzomys microtis has a total length of including a tail of . It weighs about and is the smallest species in the genus. In proportion to the head and body length, the hind feet are relatively long, being 28.5% of their length. This compares with the rather similar Oligoryzomys nigripes where the proportion is 24.5%. The ears are small and densely furred inside. The cheeks may be grey or orangeish-brown. The back is brownish and the underparts are whitish or greyish, sometimes tinged with buff. The tail is rather darker on the upper surface than the lower surface. Its karyotype has 2n = 64 and FNa = 66. Distribution and habitat O. microtis is native to South America, its range extending from northwestern Brazil, south of the Solimões River and Amazon River, to the adjoining lowlands of Peru and Bolivia, northern Argentina, eastern Paraguay and the Gran Chaco plain. Its typical habitat is marshes and wet grassland, but in Brazil it is more associated with forest borders, gallery woodland and secondary forest. In the Paraguayan Chaco it is associated with both dry and wet marshland, and has been reported from floating masses of vegetation. Ecology Breeding starts at a young age, even while still in juvenile coat, and pregnancy rates are high. In Bolivia, pregnant females have been found in March, May, August and September, and the number of embryos varied from two to eight. The Rio Mamore virus has been isolated from this species in Bolivia. Status This is a common species over much of its wide range. It is an adaptable species, able to tolerate some habitat degradation. No particular threats have been recognised and the population seems to be stable, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of least concern.

It occurs only in the cerrado and caatinga ecoregions of northeastern Brazil. Its karyotype has 2n = 52 and FNa = 68-70. Description Oligoryzomys stramineus is a large species of colilargo with a yellowish-brown head and dorsal surface and whitish underparts, with a sharp line demarcating the boundary between the two. It has long incisive foramina (openings in the hard palate of the skull) and broad zygomatic plates (bony plates in the upper jaw). The head-and-body length averages while the tail averages . Distribution and habitat This species is native to South America where it occurs in northeastern and central Brazil. Its range extends from the cerrado ecoregion of the states of northern Goiás and northern Minas Gerais southward to the caatinga ecoregion of the states of Paraíba and Pernambuco. In the cerrado, it has mainly been found in gallery forests. It shares part of its range in central Brazil with Oligoryzomys fornesi and is sometimes caught in the same line of traps. It is also sympatric with Oligoryzomys nigripes, but the two species are not found in the same trap-lines. Ecology Little is known of the breeding habits of O. stramineus; a pregnant female carrying four young was caught in September; and a juvenile was caught in August suggesting that mating may have occurred in June or July. Status O. stramineus has a wide range, and though its total population is not known, it is considered to be common and its population stable. No particular threats have been identified and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

People may have a loss of perception of a narrow range of frequencies or impaired perception of sound including sensitivity to sound or ringing in the ears. When exposure to hazards such as noise occur at work and is associated with hearing loss, it is referred to as occupational hearing loss. Hearing may deteriorate gradually from chronic and repeated noise exposure (such as to loud music or background noise) or suddenly from exposure to impulse noise, which is a short high intensity noise (such as a gunshot or airhorn). In both types, loud sound overstimulates delicate hearing cells, leading to the permanent injury or death of the cells. Once lost this way, hearing cannot be restored in humans. There are a variety of prevention strategies available to avoid or reduce hearing loss. Lowering the volume of sound at its source, limiting the time of exposure and physical protection can reduce the impact of excessive noise. If not prevented, hearing loss can be managed through assistive devices and communication strategies. The largest burden of NIHL has been through occupational exposures; however, noise-induced hearing loss can also be due to unsafe recreational, residential, social and military service-related noise exposures. It is estimated that 15% of young people are exposed to sufficient leisure noises (i.e. concerts, sporting events, daily activities, personal listening devices, etc.) to cause NIHL. There is not a limited list of noise sources that can cause hearing loss; rather, exposure to excessively high levels from any sound source over time can cause hearing loss.  Signs and symptoms  The first symptom of NIHL may be difficulty hearing a conversation against a noisy background. The effect of hearing loss on speech perception has two components. The first component is the loss of audibility, which may be perceived as an overall decrease in volume. Modern hearing aids compensate this loss with amplification. The second component is known as \\"distortion\\" or \\"clarity loss\\" due to selective frequency loss. Consonants, due to their higher frequency, are typically affected first. For example, the sounds \\"s\\" and \\"t\\" are often difficult to hear for those with hearing loss, affecting clarity of speech. NIHL can affect either one or both ears. Unilateral hearing loss causes problems with directional hearing, affecting the ability to localize sound.  Temporary and permanent hearing changes  * PTS (Permanent Threshold Shift) is a permanent change of the hearing threshold (the intensity necessary for one to detect a sound) following an event, which will never recover. PTS is measured in decibels. * TTS (Temporary Threshold Shift) is a temporary change of the hearing threshold the hearing loss that will be recovered after a few hours to couple of days. Also called auditory fatigue. TTS is also measured in decibels. In addition to hearing loss, other external symptoms of an acoustic trauma can be: * Tinnitus * Otalgia * Hyperacusis * Dizziness or vertigo; in the case of vestibular damages, in the inner-ear Tinnitus Tinnitus is described as hearing a sound when an external sound is not present. Noise- induced hearing loss can cause high-pitched tinnitus. An estimated 50 million Americans have some degree of tinnitus in one or both ears; 16 million of them have symptoms serious enough for them to see a doctor or hearing specialist. As many as 2 million become so debilitated by the unrelenting ringing, hissing, chirping, clicking, whooshing or screeching, that they cannot carry out normal daily activities. Tinnitus is the largest single category for disability claims in the military, with hearing loss a close second. The third largest category is post-traumatic stress disorder, which itself may be accompanied by tinnitus and may exacerbate it. Quality of life NIHL has implications on quality of life that extend beyond related symptoms and the ability to hear. The annual disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were estimated for noise-exposed U.S. workers.[20] DALYs represent the number of healthy years lost due to a disease or other health condition. They were defined by the 2013 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study. The DALYs calculation accounts for life limitations experienced because of hearing loss as a lost portion of a healthy year of life. So the results indicate the number of healthy years lost by a group of people over a specific time period. NIOSH used DALYs to estimate the impact of hearing loss on quality of life in the CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report article \\"Hearing Impairment Among Noise-Exposed Workers in the United States, 2003-2012.\\" It reported that 2.5 healthy years were lost each year for every 1,000 noise-exposed U.S. workers because of hearing impairment (hearing loss that impacts day-to-day activities). These lost years were shared among the 13% of workers with hearing impairment (about 130 workers out of each 1,000 workers). Mining, Construction and Manufacturing workers lost more healthy years than workers in other industry sectors; specifically and respectively in those sectors, 3.5, 3.1 and 2.7 healthy years were lost each year for every 1,000 workers. Negative impacts The negative impacts of NIHL on one's ability to reciprocate communication, socialize and interact with society are largely invisible. Hearing loss, in general, is not just an issue of volume; individuals may experience difficulty in understanding what is said over the phone, when several people are talking at once, in a large space, or when the speaker's face cannot be seen. Subsequently, challenging social interactions can negatively lead to decreased self-esteem, shame, and fear. This can be more acutely felt by those who experience hearing impairment or loss earlier in life, rather than later when it is more socially accepted. Such psychosocial states, regardless of age, can lead to social isolation, which is known to negatively impact one's overall health and well-being. The compounding impacts can also lead to depression, especially if hearing impairment leads to tinnitus. Research suggests that those with hearing impairment or loss may be at a greater risk for deterioration of quality of life, as captured by a quote from Helen Keller: \\"Blindness cuts us off from things, but deafness cuts us off from people.\\" Hearing impairment and loss of hearing, regardless of source or age, also limits experiencing the many benefits of sound on quality of life. In addition to the interpersonal social benefits, new studies suggest the effects of nature sounds, such as birds chirping and water, can positively affect an individual's capacity to recover after being stressed or to increase cognitive focus. Quality of life questionnaire Hearing loss is typically quantified by results from an audiogram; however, the degree of loss of hearing does not predict the impact on one's quality of life. The impact that NIHL can have on daily life and psychosocial function can be assessed and quantified using a validated questionnaire tool, such as the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE). The HHIE is considered a \\"useful tool for quantifying the perceived emotional and social/situational consequences of hearing loss.\\" The original tool was designed to test adults 65 years of age and older; however, modified versions exist. For adults the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults (HHIA) can be used and for adolescents the modified 28-item Hearing Environments And Reflection on Quality of Life (HEAR-QL-28) can be used. The HHIA, for example, is a 25-item questionnaire that asks both social and emotional-specific questions such as: Does a hearing problem cause you to avoid groups of people?\\" (social) and \\"Does a hearing problem cause you to feel frustrated when talking to members of your family?\\" (emotional). Response options are yes, no and sometimes. A greater score indicates greater perceived handicap. Cause The ear can be exposed to short periods of sound in excess of 120 dB without permanent harm — albeit with discomfort and possibly pain; but long term exposure to sound levels over 85 dB(A) can cause permanent hearing loss. There are two basic types of NIHL: *NIHL caused by acoustic trauma and *gradually developing NIHL.  Acute acoustic trauma  NIHL caused by acute acoustic trauma refers to permanent cochlear damage from a one-time exposure to excessive sound pressure. This form of NIHL commonly results from exposure to high-intensity sounds such as explosions, gunfire, a large drum hit loudly, and firecrackers. According to one US study, excessive noise levels in cinemas are sufficiently brief that movie-goers do not experience hearing loss.  Perceived harmfulness vs. actual harmfulness  The discomfort threshold is the loudness level from which a sound starts to be felt as too loud and thus painful by an individual. Industry workers tend to have a higher discomfort threshold (i.e. the sounds must be louder to feel painful than for non- industry workers), but the sound is just as harmful to their ears. Industry workers often suffer from NIHL because the discomfort threshold is not a relevant indicator of the harmfulness of a sound. Gradually developing Gradually developing NIHL refers to permanent cochlear damage from repeated exposure to loud sounds over a period of time. Unlike acoustic trauma, this form of NIHL does not occur from a single exposure to a high-intensity sound pressure level. Gradually developing NIHL can be caused by multiple exposures to excessive noise in the workplace or any source of repetitive, frequent exposures to sounds of excessive volume, such as home and vehicle stereos, concerts, nightclubs, and personal media players. Earplugs have been recommended for those people who regularly attend live music concerts. A range of earplugs are now available ranging from inexpensive disposable sets to custom fit, attenuated earplugs which provide true fidelity at reduced audio levels. Workplace About 22 million workers are exposed to hazardous noise, with additional millions exposed to solvents and metals that could put them at increased risk for hearing loss. Occupational hearing loss is one of the most common occupational diseases. 49% of male miners have hearing loss by the age of 50. By the age of 60, this number goes up to 70%. Construction workers also suffer an elevated risk. A screening program focused on construction workers employed at US Department of Energy facilities found 58% with significant abnormal hearing loss due to noise exposures at work. Occupational hearing loss is present in up to 33% of workers overall. Occupational exposure to noise causes 16% of adult disabling hearing loss worldwide. The following is a list of occupations that are most susceptible to hearing loss: *Agriculture *Mining *Construction *Manufacturing *Utilities *Transportation *Military *Musicians *Orchestra conductors Among musicians Musicians, from classical orchestras to rock groups, are exposed to high decibel ranges. Some rock musicians experience noise-induced hearing loss from their music, and some studies have found that \\"symphonic musicians suffer from hearing impairment and that the impairment might be ascribed to symphonic music.\\" Music-induced hearing loss is still a controversial topic for hearing researchers. While some population studies have shown that the risk for hearing loss increases as music exposure increases, other studies found little to no correlation between the two. Experts at the 2006 \\"Noise- Induced Hearing Loss in Children at Work and Play\\" Conference agreed that further research into this field was still required before making a broad generalization about music-induced hearing loss. Given the extensive research suggesting that industrial noise exposure can cause sensorineural hearing loss, a link between hearing loss and music exposures of similar level and duration (to industrial noise) seems highly plausible. Determining which individuals or groups are at risk for such exposures may be a difficult task. Despite concerns about the proliferation of personal music players, the there is only scarce evidence supporting their impact on hearing loss, and some small-sample studies suggest that only a fraction of users are affected. People from ages to 6–19 have an approximately 15% rate of hearing loss. Recommendations for musicians to protect their hearing were released in 2015 by NIOSH. The recommendations emphasized education of musicians and those who work in or around the music industry. Annual hearing assessments were also recommended to monitor thresholds as were sound level assessments to help determine the amount of time musicians and related professionals should spend in that environment. Hearing protection was also recommended, and the authors of the NIOSH recommendations even suggested that musicians consider custom earplugs as a way to combat NIHL. Despite these recommendations, musicians continue to face unique challenges in protecting their hearing when compared to individuals in industrial settings. Typically environmental controls are the first line of defense in a hearing conservation program, and depending on the type of musicians some recommendations have been set in place. These recommendations can include adjusting risers or level of the speakers and adjusting the layout of a band or orchestra. These changes in the environment can be beneficial to musicians, but the ability to accomplish them is not always possible. In the cases where these changes cannot be made, hearing protection is recommended. Hearing protection in musicians offers its own sets of benefits and complications. When used properly, hearing protection can limit the exposure of noise in individuals. Musicians have the ability to pick from several different types of hearing protection from conventional ear plugs to custom or high fidelity hearing protection. Despite this, use of hearing protection among musicians is low for several different reasons. Musicians often feel that hearing protective devices can distort how music sounds or makes it too quiet for them to hear important cues which makes them less likely to wear hearing protection even when aware of the risks. Research suggests that educations programs can be beneficial to musicians as well as working with hearing care professionals to help address the specific issues that musicians face. In 2018, a musician named Chris Goldscheider won a case against Royal Opera House for damaging his hearing in a rehearsal of Wagner's thunderous opera Die Walkure. Workplace standards NIOSH Occupational Noise Exposure Criteria Document In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) describes standards for occupational noise exposure in articles 1910.95 and 1926.52. OSHA states that an employer must implement hearing conservation programs for employees if the noise level of the workplace is equal to or above 85 dB(A) for an averaged eight-hour time period. OSHA also states that \\"exposure to impulsive or impact noise should not exceed 140 dB peak sound pressure level\\". The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends that all worker exposures to noise should be controlled below a level equivalent to 85 dBA for eight hours to minimize occupational noise induced hearing loss. NIOSH also recommends a 3 dBA exchange rate so that every increase by 3 dBA doubles the amount of the noise and halves the recommended amount of exposure time. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) instruction 605512 has some differences from OSHA 1910.95 standard, for example, OSHA 1910.95 uses a 5 dB exchange rate and DoD instruction 605512 uses a 3 dB exchange rate. There are programs that seek to increase compliance and therefore effectiveness of hearing protection rules; the programs include the use of hearing tests and educating people that loud sound is dangerous Employees are required to wear hearing protection when it is identified that their eight-hour time weighted average (TWA) is above the exposure action value of 90 dB. If subsequent monitoring shows that 85 dB is not surpassed for an eight-hour TWA, the employee is no longer required to wear hearing protection. In the European Union, directive 2003/10/EC mandates that employers shall provide hearing protection at noise levels exceeding 80 dB(A), and that hearing protection is mandatory for noise levels exceeding 85 dB(A). Directive 2003/10/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 February 2003 on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (noise) Both values are based on 8 hours per day, with a 3 dB exchange rate. A 2017 Cochrane review found low-quality evidence that legislation to reduce noise in the workplace was successful in reducing exposure both immediately and long- term.  Sporting events  Several sports stadiums pride themselves in having louder stadiums than their opponents because it may create a more difficult environment for opposing teams to play in. Currently, there are few studies on noise in sports stadiums, but some preliminary measurements show noise levels reaching 120 dB, and informal studies suggest that people may receive up to a 117% noise dose in one game. There are many challenges that face hearing conservationists such as sports culture. Sports fans will create noise in an attempt to distract other teams, and some sports teams have been known to create artificial noise in an attempt to make the stadium louder. In doing that, workers, teams, and fans may be at potential risk for damage to the auditory system. NIOSH conducted a health hazard evaluation and studies at Monster Trucking and Stock Car racing events, spectators average noise levels ranged from 95 to 100 dBA at the Monster Truck event and over 100 dBA at the stock car racing event. NIOSH researchers also published noise exposure levels for drivers, crew members, and staff. Noise levels at the Bristol Motor Speedway ranged from 96 dBA in the stands to 114 dBA for a driver inside a car during practice. Peak noise levels in the Pit area reached or exceeded 130 dB SPL, a level often associated with human hearing threshold for pain. Several prominent NASCAR drivers have complete or partial hearing loss and other symptoms from their many years of exposure. During the FIFA World Cup in 2010, noise levels created by fans blowing Vuvuzela averaged 131 dBA at the horn opening and 113 dBA at 2 meter distance. Peak levels reached 144 dB SPL, louder than a jet engine at takeoff. A study of occupational and recreational noise exposure at indoor hockey arenas found noise levels from 81 dBA to 97 dBA, with peak sound pressure levels ranging from 105 dB SPLto 124 dB SPL. Another study examined the hearing threshold of hockey officials and found mean noise exposures of 93 dBA. Hearing threshold shifts were observed in 86% of the officials (25/29). In a study of noise levels at 10 intercollegiate basketball games showed noise levels in 6 of the 10 basketball games to exceed the national workplace noise exposure standards, with participants showing temporary threshold levels at one of the games. While there is no agency that currently monitors sports stadium noise exposure, organizations such as NIOSH or OSHA use occupational standards for industrial settings that some experts feel could be applied for those working at sporting events. Workers often will not exceed OSHA standards of 90 dBA, but NIOSH, whose focus is on best practice, has stricter standards which say that when exposed to noise at or exceeding 85 dBA workers need to be put on a hearing conservation program. Workers may also be at risk for overexposure because of impact noises that can cause instant damage. Experts are suggesting that sports complexes create hearing conservation programs for workers and warn fans of the potential damage that may occur with their hearing. Studies are still being done on fan exposure, but some preliminary findings show that there are often noises that can be at or exceed 120 dB which, unprotected, can cause damage to the ears in seconds. Mechanisms 325x325px The outer ear receives sound, transmitted through the ossicles of the middle ear to the inner ear, where it is converted to a nervous signal in the cochlear and transmitted along the vestibulocochlear nerve NIHL occurs when too much sound intensity is transmitted into and through the auditory system. An acoustic signal from a sound source, such as a radio, enters into the external auditory canal (ear canal), and is funneled through to the tympanic membrane (eardrum), causing it to vibrate. The vibration of the tympanic membrane drives the middle ear ossicles, the malleus, incus, and stapes to vibrate in sync with the eardrum. The middle ear ossicles transfer mechanical energy to the cochlea by way of the stapes footplate hammering against the oval window of the cochlea, effectively amplifying the sound signal. This hammering causes the fluid within the cochlea (perilymph and endolymph) to be displaced. Displacement of the fluid causes movement of the hair cells (sensory cells in the cochlea) and an electrochemical signal to be sent from the auditory nerve (CN VIII) to the central auditory system within the brain. This is where sound is perceived. Different groups of hair cells are responsive to different frequencies. Hair cells at or near the base of the cochlea are most sensitive to higher frequency sounds while those at the apex are most sensitive to lower frequency sounds. There are two known biological mechanisms of NIHL from excessive sound intensity: damage to the structures called stereocilia that sit atop hair cells and respond to sound, and damage to the synapses that the auditory nerve makes with hair cells, also termed \\"hidden hearing loss\\".  Physiological response  The symptoms mentioned above are the external signs of the physiological response to cochlear overstimulation. Here are some elements of this response: * Damaged sensory hairs (stereocilia) of the hair cells; damaged hair cells degenerate and die. In humans and other mammals, dead hair- cells are never replaced; the resulting hearing loss is permanent. * Inflammation of the exposed areas. This inflammation causes poor blood flow in the exposed blood vessels (vascular stasis), and poor oxygen supply for the liquid inside the cochlea (endolymphatic hypoxia) Those noxious conditions worsen the damaged hair cell degeneration. * Synaptic damages, by excitotoxicity. Noise over-stimulation causes an excessive release of glutamate, causing the postsynaptic bouton to swell and burst. However the neuron connection can be repaired, and the hearing loss only caused by the \\"wiring\\" (i.e. excitotoxicity) can thus be recovered within 2–3 days. Hair cell damage or death When the ear is exposed to excessive sound levels or loud sounds over time, the overstimulation of the hair cells leads to heavy production of reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative cell death. In animal experiments, antioxidant vitamins have been found to reduce hearing loss even when administered the day after noise exposure. They were not able to fully prevent it. Damage ranges from exhaustion of the hair (hearing) cells in the ear to loss of those cells. NIHL is, therefore, the consequence of overstimulation of the hair cells and supporting structures. Structural damage to hair cells (primarily the outer hair cells) will result in hearing loss that can be characterized by an attenuation and distortion of incoming auditory stimuli. During hair cell death ‘scars’ develop, which prevent potassium rich fluid of the endolymph from mixing with the fluid on the basal domain. The potassium rich fluid is toxic to the neuronal endings and can damage hearing of the entire ear. If the endolymph fluid mixes with the fluid on the basal domain the neurons become depolarized, causing complete hearing loss. In addition to complete hearing loss, if the area is not sealed and leakage continues further tissue damage will occur. The ‘scars’ that form to replace the damaged hair cell are caused by supporting hair cells undergoing apoptosis and sealing the reticular lamina, which prevents fluid leakage. The cell death of two supporting hair cells rapidly expands their apical domain, which compresses the hair cell beneath its apical domain. Nerve damage Recent studies have investigated additional mechanisms of NIHL involving delayed or disabled electrochemical transmission of nerve impulses from the hair cell to and along the auditory nerve. In cases of extreme acute acoustic trauma, a portion of the postsynaptic dendrite (where the hair cell transfers electrochemical signals to the auditory nerve) can rupture from overstimulation, temporarily stopping all transmission of auditory input to the auditory nerve. This is known as excitotoxicity. Usually, this sort of rupture heals within about five days, resulting in functional recovery of that synapse. While healing, an over-expression of glutamate receptors can result in temporary tinnitus, or ringing in the ears. Repeated ruptures at the same synapse may eventually fail to heal, leading to permanent hearing loss. Prolonged exposure to high intensity noise has also been linked to the disruption of ribbon synapses located in the synaptic cleft between inner hair cells and spiral ganglion nerve fibers, leading to a disorder referred to as cochlear synaptopathy or hidden hearing loss. This disorder is cumulative and over time, leads to degeneration of the spiral ganglion cells of the inner ear and overall dysfunction in the neural transmission between auditory nerve fibers and the central auditory pathway. The most common symptom of cochlear synaptopathy is difficulty understanding speech, especially in the presence of competing noise. However, this type of hearing impairment is often undetectable by conventional pure tone audiometry, thus the name \\"hidden\\" hearing loss. Acoustic over-exposure can also result in decreased myelination at specific points on the auditory nerve. Myelin, an insulating sheath surrounding nerve axons, expedites electrical impulses along nerves throughout the nervous system. Thinning of the myelin sheath on the auditory nerve significantly slows the transmission of electrical signals from hair cell to auditory cortex, reducing comprehension of auditory stimuli by delaying auditory perception, particularly in noisy environments. Individual susceptibility towards noise There appear to be large differences in individual susceptibility to NIHL. The following factors have been implicated: * missing acoustic reflex * previous sensorineural hearing loss * a bad general health state: bad cardiovascular function, insufficient intake of oxygen, a high platelet aggregation rate; and most importantly, a high viscosity of the blood * cigarette smoking * exposure to ototoxic chemicals (medication or environmental chemicals that can damage the ear), including certain solvents and heavy metals * type 2 diabetes Diagnosis Example audiogram of a notch-shaped high frequency hearing loss. Both NIHL caused by acoustic trauma and gradually-developed-NIHL can often be characterized by a specific pattern presented in audiological findings. NIHL is generally observed to decrease hearing sensitivity in the higher frequencies, also called an audiometric notch, especially at 4000 Hz, but sometimes at 3000 or 6000 Hz. The symptoms of NIHL are usually presented equally in both ears. This typical 4000 Hz notch is due to the transfer function of the ear. As does any object facing a sound, the ear acts as a passive filter, although the inner ear is not an absolute passive filter because the outer hair cells provide active mechanisms. A passive filter is a low pass: the high frequencies are more absorbed by the object because high frequencies impose a higher pace of compression-decompression to the object. The high frequency harmonics of a sound are more harmful to the inner-ear. However, not all audiological results from people with NIHL match this typical notch. Often a decline in hearing sensitivity will occur at frequencies other than at the typical 3000–6000 Hz range. Variations arise from differences in people's ear canal resonance, the frequency of the harmful acoustic signal, and the length of exposure. As harmful noise exposure continues, the commonly affected frequencies will broaden to lower frequencies and worsen in severity. Prevention A video describing proper usage of soft foam earplugs NIHL can be prevented through the use of simple, widely available, and economical tools. This includes but is not limited to personal noise reduction through the use of ear protection (i.e. earplugs and earmuffs), education, and hearing conservation programs. For the average person, there are three basic things that one can do to prevent NIHL: turn down the volume on devices, move away from the source of noise, and wear hearing protectors in loud environments. Non-occupational noise exposure is not regulated or governed in the same manner as occupational noise exposure; therefore prevention efforts rely heavily on education awareness campaigns and public policy. The WHO cites that nearly half of those affected by hearing loss could have been prevented through primary prevention efforts such as: \\"reducing exposure (both occupational and recreational) to loud sounds by raising awareness about the risks; developing and enforcing relevant legislation; and encouraging individuals to use personal protective devices such as earplugs and noise-cancelling earphones and headphones.\\" Personal noise reduction devices Personal noise reduction devices can be passive, active or a combination. Passive ear protection includes earplugs or earmuffs which can block noise up to a specific frequency. Earplugs and earmuffs can provide the wearer with 10 dB to 40 dB of attenuation. However, use of earplugs is only effective if the users have been educated and use them properly; without proper use, protection falls far below manufacturer ratings. Higher consistency of performance has been found with custom-molded earplugs. Because of their ease of use without education, and ease of application or removal, earmuffs have more consistency with both compliance and noise attenuation. Active ear protection (electronic pass-through hearing protection devices or EPHPs) electronically filter out noises of specific frequencies or decibels while allowing the remaining noise to pass through. A personal attenuation rating can be objectively measured by using a hearing protection fit testing system. Education Education is key to prevention. Before hearing protective actions will take place, a person must understand they are at risk for NIHL and know their options for prevention. Hearing protection programs have been hindered by people not wearing the protection for various reasons, including the desire to converse, uncomfortable devices, lack of concern about the need for protection, and social pressure against wearing protection. Although youth are at risk for hearing loss, one study found that 96.3% of parents did not believe their adolescents were at risk, and only 69% had talked to their children about hearing protection; those aware of NIHL risks were more likely to talk to their teens. A systematic review of the effectiveness of interventions to promote the use of hearing protection devices such as earplugs and earmuffs among workers found that tailored interventions improve the average use of such devices when compared with no intervention. Tailored interventions involve the use of communication or other types of interventions that are specific to an individual or a group and aim to change behavior. Mixed interventions such as mailings, distribution of hearing protection devices, noise assessments, and hearing testing are also more effective in improving the use of hearing protection devices compared with hearing testing alone. Programs that increased the proportion of workers wearing hearing protection equipment did reduce overall hearing loss.  Personal listening devices  Although research is limited, it suggests that increased exposure to loud noise through personal listening devices is a risk factor for noise induced hearing loss. More than half of people are exposed to sound through music exposure on personal devices greater than recommended levels. Research suggests stronger correlations between extended duration or elevated usage of personal listening devices and hearing loss. Hearing conservation programs Workers in general industry who are exposed to noise levels above 85 dBA are required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to be in a hearing conservation program (HCP), which includes noise measurement, noise control, periodic audiometric testing, hearing protection, worker education, and record keeping. Twenty-four states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have OSHA-approved state plans and have adopted their own standards and enforcement policies. Most of these state standards are identical to those of federal OSHA. However, some states have adopted different standards or may have different enforcement policies. Most health and safety regulations are designed to keep damage risk within \\"acceptable limits\\" — that is, some people are likely to incur a hearing loss even when exposed to less than the maximum daily amount of noise specified in a regulation. Hearing conservation programs in other arenas (schools, military) have become more common, and it has been established that unsafe listening behaviors, such as listening to loud noise for extended periods of time without protection, persist despite knowledge of potential hearing loss effects. However, it is understood that HCPs are designed to change behavior, which is known to be a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. According to Keppler et al. in their 2015 study of such programming, they cite the necessary attitude change towards the susceptibility of risk and degree of severity of hearing loss. Among young adults, the concept of severity is most crucial because it has been found that behavior change may not occur unless an individual experiences NIHL or similarly related NIHL tinnitus, furthering warranting a multi-pronged approach based on hearing conservation programming and education. Interventions to prevent noise-induced hearing loss often have many components. A 2017 Cochrane review found that hearing loss prevention programs suggest that stricter legislation might reduce noise levels. Giving workers information on their noise exposure levels by itself was not shown to decrease exposure to noise. Ear protection, if used correctly, has the potential to reduce noise to safer levels, but does not necessarily prevent hearing loss. External solutions such as proper maintenance of equipment can lead to noise reduction, but further study of this issue under real-life conditions is needed. Other possible solutions include improved enforcement of existing legislation and better implementation of well-designed prevention programmes, which have not yet been proven conclusively to be effective. The implications is that further research could affect conclusions reached. Several hearing conservation programs have been developed to educate a variety of audiences about the dangers of NIHL and how to prevent it. Dangerous Decibels aims to significantly reduce the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss and tinnitus through exhibits, education and research. We’re hEAR for You is a small non-profit that distributes information and ear plugs at concert and music festival venues. The Buy Quiet program was created to combat occupational noise exposures by promoting the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourage manufacturers to design quieter equipment. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders developed the It's a Noisy Planet. Protect their Hearing educational campaign to inform preteens, parents, and educators about the causes and prevention of NIHL. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health partnered with the National Hearing Conservation Association in 2007 to establish the Safe-in- Sound Excellence and Innovation in Hearing Loss Prevention Awards to recognize organizations that are successfully implementing hearing loss prevention concepts into their daily routines. Medication Medications are still being researched to determine if they can prevent NIHL. No medication has been proven to prevent or repair NIHL in humans. There is evidence that hearing loss can be minimized by taking high doses of magnesium for a few days, starting as soon as possible after exposure to the loud noise. A magnesium- high diet also seems to be helpful as an NIHL-preventative if taken in advance of exposure to loud noises. Consuming sizable amounts of magnesium can be potentially harmful, so this treatment should be followed with caution. Along the same line of research, higher dietary intakes of antioxidant vitamins is also associated with an decreased incidence of hearing loss. Like magnesium, supplementation helps in animal models. Tentative research in a mouse model suggests that blocking the GluA2-lacking, calcium-permeable forms of the AMPA receptor protects against hearing damage. Sound or stress training Despite different people having different thresholds for what noises are painful, this pain threshold has no correlation with which noises cause hearing damage. The ear can not get more resistant to noise harmfulness by training it to noise. The cochlea is partially protected by the acoustic reflex, but being frequently exposed to noise does not lower the reflex threshold. It had been observed that noise conditioning (i.e. exposure to loud non-traumatizing noise) several hours prior to the exposure to traumatizing sound level, significantly reduced the damages inflicted to the hair-cells. The same \\"protective effect\\" was also observed with other stressors such as heat-shock conditioning and stress (by restraint) conditioning. This “protective effect\\" only happens if the traumatizing noise is presented within an optimum interval of time after the sound-conditioning session (-24 hours for a 15 min. sound-conditioning; no more protection after 48 hours). This \\"protective effect\\" had long been thought to involve the active mechanisms of the outer hair cells and the efferent system commanding them. The contractile effect of the outer hair cells, activated by the efferent nervous system has been proven to provide a protective effect against acoustic trauma. Cross- section of the cochlea. The inner hair cells are connected to afferent nerve fibers, and the outer hair cells are connected to efferent nerve fibers. However, a 2006 study revealed a different protective mechanism for stress conditioning. The study revealed that the stressor (sound, heat, or stress) conditioning increases the receptibility to glucocorticoid, a kind of anti- inflammatory hormone. The effects of glucocorticoid thus mitigate the inflammation from an acoustic trauma that can lead to hearing loss. In fact, high doses of corticoids are often prescribed by physicians after an acoustic- trauma in order to mitigate the inflammatory response. Summarized, sound (or other stressor) conditioning is a pre-emptive medication against cochlea inflammation. It does not make the ear more resistant to noise. It reduces the inflammation caused by the acoustic trauma, which would cause subsequent damages to hair cells. While an anti-inflammatory medication would increase the quantity of anti-inflammatory hormone in the whole body, noise conditioning increases the number of receptors for the anti-inflammatory hormone, and only in the areas where it is much needed (i.e. cochlea). Physiological response * stressor (noise, heat shock or stress) conditioning activates hormonal glands: the HPA axis. Note that the HPA axis is associated to the immune system * this HPA axis activation results in the up regulation of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the cochlea and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Note that the glucocorticoid hormone is a kind of immune-reaction-inhibitor, including the inflammation reaction. * This up regulation of GR thus prevents GR down regulation induced by acoustic trauma * The protective effect of noise-conditioning is blocked by adrenalectomy or pharmacological treatment with RU486 + metyrapone (a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist). Treatment Treatment options that offer \\"cures\\" for NIHL are under research and development. Currently there are no commonly used cures, but rather assistive devices and therapies to try and manage the symptoms of NIHL. Acute acoustic trauma Several clinical trials have been conducted to treat temporary NIHL occurring after a traumatic noise event, such as a gunshot or firework. In 2007, individuals with acute acoustic trauma after firecracker exposure were injected intratympanically with a cell permeable ligand, AM-111. The trial found AM-111 to have a therapeutic effect on at least two cases of those with acute trauma. Treatment with a combination of prednisolone and piracetam appeared to rescue patients with acute trauma after exposure to gunshots. However, those who received the treatment within an hour of exposure had higher rates of recovery and significantly lower threshold shifts compared to those who received treatment after one hour. Additionally, clinical trials using antioxidants after a traumatic noise event to reduce reactive oxygen species have displayed promising results. Injections with allopurinol, lazaroids, α-D-tocopherol, and mannitol were found to reduce the threshold shift after noise exposure. Another antioxidant, Ebselen, has been shown to have promising results for both TTS and PTS. Ebselen mimics gluthathione peroxide, an enzyme that has many functions, including scavenging hydrogen peroxide and reactive oxygen species. After noise exposure, gluthathione peroxide decreases in the ear. An oral administration of ebselen in both preclinical tests on guinea pigs and human trials indicate that noise induced TTS and PTS was reduced. Recently, combination therapy with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) and corticosteroids has been found to be effective for acute acoustic trauma. Acute noise exposure causes inflammation and lower oxygen supply in the inner ear. Corticosteroids hinder the inflammatory reaction and HBO provides an adequate oxygen supply. This therapy has been shown to be effective when initiated within three days after acoustic trauma. Therefore, this condition is considered an ENT emergency. Gradually occurring NIHL At the present time, no established clinical treatments exist to reverse the effects of permanent NIHL. However, current research for the possible use of drug and genetic therapies look hopeful. In addition, management options such as hearing aids and counseling exist. Many studies have been conducted looking at regeneration of hair cells in the inner ear. While hair cells are generally not replaced through cell regeneration, mechanisms are being studied to induce replacement of these important cells. One study involves the replacement of damaged hair cells with regenerated cells, via the mechanism of gene transfer of atonal gene Math1 to pluripotent stem cells within the inner ear. Other atonal genes are being studied to induce regeneration of hair cells in the inner ear. Management For people living with NIHL, there are several management options that can improve the ability to communicate. These options include counseling, amplification, and other assisted listening devices, such as frequency modulation (FM) systems. FM systems can enhance the use of hearing aids and overcome the effects of poor listening conditions because the signal is sent from the microphone worn by the speaker directly to the listener. The prognosis has improved with the recent advancements in digital hearing aid technology, such as directional microphones, open-fit hearing aids, and more advanced algorithms. Hearing aids can mask or cover up the tinnitus, and many with hearing loss and tinnitus find relief by using hearing aids. Though there is no cure or agreed-upon treatment for tinnitus, some drugs have been shown to provide temporary reduction of tinnitus. Other treatments for tinnitus include cognitive-behavioral therapy, biofeedback, and electrical stimulation. Annual audiological evaluations are recommended to monitor any changes in a patient's hearing and to modify hearing-aid prescriptions. A systematic-review conducted by the American Academy of Audiology Task Force On the Health- Related Quality of Life Benefits of Amplification in Adults found the use of hearing aids to increase quality of life. The review pertained to adults who experienced sensorineural hearing loss, which can be caused by excessive, loud noise. Epidemiology The World Health Organization estimates that nearly 360 million people have moderate to profound hearing loss from all causes. Rates of hearing loss has traditionally been attributed to occupational or firearm-related exposure, as well as recreational exposure. The World Health Organization estimated in 2015 that 1.1 billion young people are at risk for hearing loss caused by unsafe listening practices. The over-exposure to excessive loud noise is partially attributed to recreational exposure, such as the use of personal audio devices with music at high volumes for long durations, or social settings such as bars, entertainment and sporting events. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the ISO 1999 standards for the estimation of hearing thresholds and noise-induced hearing impairment. They used data from two noise and hearing study databases, one presented by Burns and Robinson (Hearing and Noise in Industry, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1970) and by Passchier-Vermeer (1968). As race and ethnicity are some of the factors that can affect the expected distribution of pure-tone hearing thresholds several other national or regional datasets exist, from Sweden, Norway, South Korea, the United States and Spain. In the United States hearing is one of the health outcomes measure by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a survey research program conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics. It examines health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. While there is no perfect way to pinpoint hearing loss from excessive noise, researchers look for audiometric notches in a hearing test—dips in the ability to hear certain frequencies—as signs of possible NIHL. As of 2011 data, approximately 24% adults age 20-69 in the United States has an audiometric notch. This data identified differences in NIHL based on age, gender, race/ethnicity, and whether or not a person is exposed to noise at work. Among people aged 20–29, 19.2% had an audiometric notch, compared to 27.3% of people aged 50–59. Males in general had a notch more often than females, regardless of occupational noise exposure, for both unilateral and bilateral audiometric notches. An epidemiological study of 6557 automotive manufacturing workers in China (median age 28 years old) reported that in 62% of the settings where noise exposures were evaluated, levels exceeded the recommended level of 85 dBA. The prevalence of hearing loss was 41% among auto part manufacturing workers, followed by 31% of power train workers and 24% in automotive manufacturing. Across job categories, the highest prevalence rate was observed among welders, of 53%. The prevalence rates were associted with noise levels and the workers' cumulative noise exposure. Occupational noise exposure is the main risk factor for work-related hearing loss. One study examined hearing test results obtained between 2000-2008 for workers ages 18–65 who had a higher occupational noise exposure than the average worker. Of the sample taken, 18% of the workers had hearing loss. Of the occupations considered, the Mining industry had the highest prevalence and risk of hearing loss, at approximately 27%. Other industries with a higher prevalence and risk included Construction (23.48%) and Manufacturing, especially Wood Product and Non-metallic Mineral Product (19.89%), Apparel (20.18%), and Machinery (21.51%). Estimates of rates of hearing loss have been reported for workers in the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting (AFFH) sector. The overall prevalence of hearing loss (defined as a pure‐tone average threshold across frequencies 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz of 25 dB or more in either ear) was 15% but that rate was exceeded in several of the subsectors of those industries. Prevalences were highest among workers in Forest Nurseries and Gathering of Forest Products at 36% and Timber Tract Operations at 22%. The Aquaculture sub‐sector had the highest adjusted risk (adjusted probability ratio of 1.7) of all sub‐sectors of the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting industries. The same methodology was used to estimate the prevalence of hearing loss for noise-exposed U.S. workers within the Health Care and Social Assistance sector. The prevalence of hearing loss in the Medical Laboratories subsector was 31% and in the Offices of All Other Miscellaneous Health Practitioners subsector was 24%. The Child Day Care Services subsector had a 52% higher risk than the reference industry.While the overall HSA sector prevalence for hearing loss was 19%, the prevalence in the Medical Laboratories subsector and the Offices of All Other Miscellaneous Health Practitioners subsector were 31% and 24%, respectively. The Child Day Care Services subsector had a 52% higher risk than the reference industry of workers who are not exposed to noise at work (Couriers and Messengers). Overall, audiometric records show that about 33% of working-age adults with a history of occupational noise exposure have evidence of noise-induced hearing damage, and 16% of noise-exposed workers have material hearing impairment.

Political career Brown was first elected to the York Borough Council in 1969, defeating three challengers in the city's fourth ward, and was re- elected in 1972. He campaigned for Mayor of York in 1974 and 1976, but lost to Philip White both times. He also ran for a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1977 as a candidate of the Progressive Conservative Party, finishing second against New Democratic Party incumbent Tony Grande in Oakwood. In January 1978, he was appointed by Premier Bill Davis to the Metro Toronto and Region Conservation Authority.\\"Davis appoints a Tory loser conservationist\\", Globe and Mail, 18 January 1978, P4. After a four-year absence, Brown returned to York Council in 1978, winning election to the city's Board of Control. The position also gave him an automatic place on the Metropolitan Toronto Council. He was re-elected in 1980, 1982 and 1985, and served as York's budget chief for this entire period.\\"The candidates\\", Toronto Star, 10 November 1988, A16.

He was elected to succeed Alan Tonks as mayor of York in 1988, defeating former MPP Tony Grande by a significant margin. Brown highlighted his record of financial accountability and suggested that Grande did not have significant municipal experience to govern the city.

Although he produced illustrations for Broadway theatrical productions, Hollywood films, the United States Army, and numerous corporate clients, Klein is best remembered for the iconic travel images he created for Howard Hughes and Trans World Airlines (TWA) during the 1950s and 1960s. Early career Klein was born in El Paso, Texas in 1918, but moved to California where he attended the Art Center School (later renamed Art Center College of Design) in Los Angeles. During the 1930s, he was a prominent member of the California Watercolor Society and displayed his work at various exhibits, most notably the Golden Gate International Exposition of 1939–40.Hughes, Edan Milton. Artists in California: 1786-1940. Sacramento: Crocker Art Museum, 2002. During World War II, Klein served for the United States Army and produced a variety of illustrations on behalf of the United States Armed Forces. In 1953, the United States Air Force created the Air Force Art Collection, which features several of Klein’s works. The Smithsonian Institution has periodically exhibited a number of these pieces at its museum in Washington D.C. Following the war, Klein relocated to New York City where he became the preferred illustrator of the Broadway Theater District. He is credited with creating window cards and posters for many of the most popular Broadway productions of the late 1940s and early 1950s, including: Death of a Salesman; Brigadoon; The Most Happy Fella; The Music Man; Cat on a Hot Tin Roof; and Alice In Wonderland.www.davidkleinart.com Trans World Airlines TWA NY Ad by David Klein By the mid-1950s, Klein had established a reputation as one of America's preeminent commercial illustrators. However, his most lasting contribution to the art world came in the following decade as he applied his talent to the world of commercial travel. Between approximately 1955–1965, Klein designed numerous award-winning travel advertisement posters, many of which are now considered emblematic of the 1960s Jet Age. Klein produced the bulk of this work for Howard Hughes and Trans World Airlines (TWA), illustrating dozens of posters advertising travel throughout the United States and abroad.www.davidkleinart.com/biography Through his TWA work, Klein earned additional recognition, and, in 1957, New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) added Klein’s TWA Times Square poster to its permanent collection.\\"Orbitz Asks Travelers To Take Five\\" (retrieved 1/3/2009) Revival and renewed interest In the summer of 2001, internet travel agency Orbitz launched a six-poster advertising series featuring Klein's original images.

It is told in first person from the point of view of sixteen-year-old Daystar, son of Cimorene, a woman who lives at the edge of the Enchanted Forest. Plot summary Cimorene raises Daystar and tells him legends about the Enchanted Forest, swordsmanship, spells, and magical protocols. One day, Antorell, a member of the Society of Wizards who has a grudge against Cimorene, tries to attack them. Cimorene melts Antorell with a spell, which raises many questions in Daystar's mind; he didn't know that his mother could do any magic. However, Cimorene refuses to answer Daystar's questions, and goes into the Enchanted Forest to retrieve a sword, which she gives to Daystar. She then sends him into the forest telling him not to come back until he can tell her why he had to leave. When Daystar enters the forest, he meets a talking golden lizard named Suz, who tells Daystar that the sword Cimorene gave him is the 'Sword of the Sleeping King.' Daystar, confused about what all this can mean, is instructed by Suz to \\"follow the sword.\\" Trying to find a place to spend the night, he enters the middle of a ring of hedges and finds a young fire witch named Shiara, who can do fire magic but only sporadically, as it does not always work for her. She explains that the wizards heard about her lack of control and kidnapped her. However, she burned the Head Wizard's staff, ran away to the Enchanted Forest, and got caught in the middle of the hedges. Daystar tells Shiara about his quest, and she decides to accompany him. Afterwards, when Daystar shows Shiara his sword and they both touch it together, they feel a surprising jolt. The next morning, the bushes let Daystar out but refuse to allow Shiara to leave until she asks nicely, which takes a lot of time as she is not in the habit of politeness. Afterwards, Daystar warns Shiara that she will need to be more polite to people and things in the future. Soon, Shiara apologizes for her rudeness. As they venture through the forest, a wizard who is after Shiara attacks them by making a river turn into a water monster, and although Shiara attempts to burn it, nothing happens. But suddenly, the wizard and monster disappear, leaving only the wizard's broken staff behind. A nearby elf tells Daystar to help himself to the staff, but Shiara soon realizes that the staff pieces turn the moss brown and dead, and when Daystar picks up the middle piece, it explodes, burning his arm in the process. Shiara tries to help him until a cat leads them both to the house of Morwen, a witch who lives inside of the Enchanted Forest. Morwen quickly heals Daystar, gives both Daystar and Shiara a bundle of food, and gives Shiara a kitten which Shiara names Nightwitch. Morwen tells them to travel up the river to find the castle that they are looking for. As they travel up the river, they meet a princess who asks for Daystar's sword. The princess tells them that a wizard told her to take the sword to save a knight she loves. The wizard, who is Antorell, shows up and tries to attack Daystar. But he is interrupted when a dragon who is looking for a princess comes. Shiara offers the princess they just met to the Dragon. The princess fainted when she saw the dragon, but before the dragon can take her away, the princess's love shows up, and the knight, who does not want to fight the dragon, decide to have a tourney for fun, but in the middle of it a small tree pops up and surprises the dragon. In his surprise, the dragon accidentally hits the knight with his tail, which makes the princess hysterical. Daystar tells the princess to see Morwen for help. The dragon decides to travel with Shiara and Daystar and insists on leading them on a \\"shortcut\\" to the castle. As they pass through a clearing, an invisible wall stops them. Somehow, Shiara learns how to make things invisible from this, which causes her to panic. As the three pass the castle, an evil sorceress turns Shiara into stone. Daystar fights the sorceress, and she dies, but Shiara is still a stone. Suz shows up and suggests that Daystar kiss her, and although this works, it annoys Shiara. The castle in the meanwhile has somehow disappeared, and when they come to the next clearing, they find a strange tower-house that belongs to a magician named Telemain. After some misunderstandings, Telemain allows them to stay the night and advises them to travel through the Caves of Chance. When the group travels through the Caves, Daystar finds a small key, which a strange, jelly- like creature called a quozzel insists is its responsibility and confronts Daystar. At the end of the caves, the quozzel causes a cave-in that doesn't kill anyone, although Shiara's arm is broken. Daystar causes the quozzel to leave by hitting it with his sword and they escape with the help of several dwarves who keep calling Daystar 'Lord', much to his annoyance. The adventurers arrive near the center of the forest, meeting the King of Dragons, Kazul, who explains that Daystar must find and save Mendanbar, the King of the Enchanted Forest, who has been trapped in his castle for about 16 years by the wizards; he has not been able to be rescued because of a shield the wizards made around the castle, and the dragons put up a shield around it as well to keep the wizards from doing more harm. When the dragons take down their shield protecting the castle, Daystar uses the sword to break the wizard's shield. The wizards show up and freeze Daystar with a spell, but Shiara hides and is spared, and when the wizards attempt to kill the king, they find out that the figure on the bed is a decoy, and several leave to find the king. The freezing spell soon wears off, and Daystar fights the wizards. Shiara sets Antorell on fire and Daystar sticks the sword into a brazier in the room, shouting a spell his mother taught him, which allows him to see the magical network of the forest and to use it to disable the wizards' ability to use the forest's magic, leaving the wizards with only stored spells and swords and enabling Daystar to throw the key into the fire. The king comes out, and when Daystar hands him his sword, he realizes that the king is his father, which makes Daystar the heir to the Enchanted Forest. Daystar and the others leave and find Morwen tending to a wounded Telemain. They later explained to Daystar what had happened during the first three books. The books end with Telemain and Morwen announcing their engagement. Characters *Cimorene - Cimorene, Daystar's mother, wife of Mendanbar and Queen of the Enchanted Forest, is a brave former princess who escaped her parents by running away and becoming the princess of Kazul, who later became the King of Dragons. Cimorene enjoyed this position until she met Mendanbar, the King of the Enchanted Forest. Unfortunately, soon after they were married, Mendanbar was captured by the wizards, and Cimorene realized the necessity of waiting until her son grew up for Mendanbar to be rescued. *Daystar - Daystar is the son of Cimorene and Mendanbar, the Sleeping King; however, he is unaware that he is a prince when the story opens because his mother has been hiding his identity his whole life while all the while she has been teaching him the skills he will need to rescue his father. When Cimorene sends Daystar into the Enchanted Forest, he has the skills and the politeness to stumble along upon the path of finding his father and mature at the same time. *Shiara - Shiara, an impolite fire witch, is an unhappy young woman. Although she can occasionally light things on fire, she has little command over her powers. Wizards kidnap her, because of her limited ability, to test spells on her, but she is able to run away. In the Enchanted Forest, Shiara meets Daystar and joins him in his quest. *Mendanbar - Mendanbar, the Sleeping King of the Enchanted Forest, is the husband of Cimorene and the father of Daystar. He first met Cimorene when he was trying to figure out why parts of the Enchanted Forest were losing their magic, and he soon found out that she was no normal princess; however, soon after he fell in love with and married her, the wizards captured him and held him in the castle, where he stayed for the sixteen years it took for his son to become old enough to rescue him. *Kazul - Kazul, the King of Dragons, became a great friend of Cimorene while Cimorene was her princess. When Cimorene's husband was captured, Kazul and her dragons decided to protect him until Daystar grew old enough to rescue him. When Daystar does come to rescue him, Kazul and her dragons help clear his path by getting rid of all the wizards that they can. *Morwen - Morwen is a witch who lives in the Enchanted Forest and has a large number of cats with very different and unique personalities. Morwen herself is not a typical witch, which got her into trouble in previous books. She is a great friend of Cimorene, and one of the few people who can understand Telemain. *Telemain - Telemain is a magician (emphatically different from a wizard) who enjoys speaking in very technical terms, and his speech must often be translated by Morwen for anyone to understand it. At the end of the book, Telemain and Morwen are going to be married. *Antorell - Antorell is a magically challenged wizard who has tried to stop the dragons and Cimorene many times. He has a particular grudge against Cimorene, and does many things to hurt her and her family, but they always get the better of him.  Differences between versions  The book was the first written of the four, as a standalone, but tweaked slightly for republication as the fourth and final chapter of the Enchanted Forest Chronicles. Small edits like typesetting, word order and slight rephrasings, and style formatting like extra paragraph breaks and avoidance of semicolons permeate the book. (The only major omission in the new version is the handful of illustrations from the original.) Aside from those: Some major differences include large additions to the text for series mythology: *Telemain's sesquipedalian loquaciousness *the gargoyle in the study (which gets a whole page directing Daystar and Shiara to the right room) *Willin the elf (half a page when Mendanbar first exits the castle, then additional pieces to keep the banquet in order) *\\"in which\\"-type chapter names (the original had none) and some small extra touches/hints for readers of the other three books: *the quozzel's description of the wizard who left the key is heard and hints that it was Zemenar; the original only indicates that it doesn't match Antorell's *Kazul herself had eaten Zemenar and hints at it earlier Other changes for series mythology include *\\"argelfraster\\" to trigger the wizard-melting spell (in the original Cimorene merely pointed) *the single dragon that could perform the Colin's Stone task became King, not the oldest of several to do it *Telemain called Kazul ahead on the magic mirror (in the original he \\"sent a spell\\") *the nature of the sword, which originally was made for dealing with wizards and was used by the Kings of the Enchanted Forest, counteracting wizards' magic differently; in the new version, it was brought in line with what was established in previous books, such as Mendanbar being the only such King *the key to the castle is downplayed in the original, but opens any door in the castle in the new mythology and has more text devoted to it *the new version explicitly states that Mendanbar did not have to eat while prisoner *the magic of the Enchanted Forest gets a little more description by the end (and the deterioration caused by wizards' staffs is adjusted from stems breaking to the dead powder); fire magic is slightly more fleshed out (when Shiara uses it on the invisible castle); the Prince of the Ruby Throne is described as a sorcerer, instead of a magician (although even in the original, Telemain was a magician and they were general-purpose) *the new version includes one token jab at fairy-tale conventions the way the other three books do (about princes and glass coffins) Parts of the original that are rather contradicted by the other three books, mostly mentioned at the end of the book (and, along with \\"argelfraster\\", the most likely things a reader of them might notice by reading the original version last): *the beginning of Cimorene's life with the dragons is slightly different *the sword, again, was anti-wizard from the start, with a longer history of rivalry over it *Cimorene and Mendanbar's courtship was a little slower, and though they had gotten engaged soon enough, they married early specifically so Cimorene could help recover the sword, which was stolen earlier and kept in a tower *Antorell's bitterness and vendetta against Cimorene also stemmed from her rebuffing his romantic advances! *Cimorene did not know she was pregnant until much later, after the wizards' bubble went up (oddly, it is only in the original that Mendanbar immediately addresses Daystar by name) *Zemenar was not the Head Wizard; in the new version, of course, he was, and after he was eaten it was the new Head Wizard who didn't tell Antorell what the sword was In addition to the various other minor changes in wording, the new version is much more specific about things like heights, intervals of time, number and sexes of dwarves in the caves, Forest vegetation (most notably lilacs instead of plain bushes when the young dragon first appears), and Daystar's bodily struggles at the cave-in and final wizard fight by the brazier. It redefines a few bits of geography (of the Forest, the cave-in, the location of the Mountains of Morning) as well. Finally, the last three words of the book are adjusted in perhaps a nod to the fairy tale themes of the others: \\"Smiling, I picked up the other two bundles and started after Shiara\\" becomes \\"...followed happily after\\".

Design The CB900c had a front and rear air assisted suspension, shaft drive, and a dual-range sub-transmission. The CB900C was derived from the DOHC CB750K, and is closely related to the CB900F and the 1983-only CB1100F, both derivatives of the CB750 line. The air/oil cooled DOHC engine has 4 32 mm Keihin CV carburetors and electronic ignition. The front suspension relies on air pressure for preload while the rear uses air as the main springing medium. The bike has two front disc brakes and a single rear disc. The CB900C is something of a \\"parts bin\\" bike, as it shares components with two contemporary Honda bikes, the CB750 and CB900F. The GL and CX series of touring motorcycles of the time are the source of the final drive and rear suspension assemblies of the CB900C. The frame was derived from the European CB900F, extended 2 inches to accommodate the sub-transmission components. The sub-transmission involves a jack shaft that allows the rider to select a \\"high\\" or \\"low\\" range for the five gears, effectively giving an overdrive 6th speed for cruising. Full Honda accessories, (fairings, lower leg fairings, saddlebags and trunk) were available to help make the CB900C a touring motorcycle. Reception The Rider and Cycle World reviews of 1980 were less than enthusiastic, complaining of \\"a lack of purity in the custom styling\\". The excessive weight and the soft suspension had a detrimental effect on handling and on cornering ability. Despite the lacklustre reviews, the CB900 Custom has gained a small cult following due to its 10 speeds, styling, comfort, reliability, and ample power output.  1983 CB1000C (Custom)  In 1983, Honda replaced the CB900C with the CB1000C.

Description A small mouse, Neacomys minutus has a head-and-body length of and a tail of . The upper parts are clad in rather coarse fur which is dark orangish-brown and finely grizzled with black; the underparts are pale and there are short, grooved spines mixed in with the fur. The tail is sparsely haired and is bicoloured, being dark above and pale beneath. The ears are small and rounded, and the hind feet are slender and have naked soles, the central three of the five claws being considerably longer than the outer ones. Distribution and habitat N. minutus is found in the Amazon basin in western Brazil and eastern Peru. Its range includes the middle and lower basin of the Juruá River in Amazonas State, and the adjoining part of Loreto Region in Peru. Its habitat is the seasonally flooded moist broadleaf várzea forest and the drier, upland, terra firme forest. Ecology Breeding takes place in both the dry and the wet season, and seems to start at a young age, as some reproductively active individuals still have unworn teeth and have not fully shed their juvenile fur. The average litter size is three; one female was found to be both pregnant and lactating. It shares its range with Neacomys spinosus but is replaced in the upper parts of the Juruá basin by Neacomys musseri. Status This mouse has a very wide range and is assumed to have a stable population. It is probably able to tolerate some degree of habitat modification and it occurs in at least two protected areas, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

The 2006 Progressive Enterprises Dispute was an industrial dispute between New Zealand supermarket company Progressive Enterprises and employees represented by the National Distribution Union and the EPMU. On 25 August 2006, over 500 employees at Progressive's four distribution centres (in Auckland, Palmerston North and Christchurch) began a 48-hour strike supporting a demand for a national collective agreement involving an eight percent wage increase and pay parity between the four centres. On 26 August 2006 the company locked out the strikers indefinitely, suspending operations at its distribution centres, with suppliers delivering goods directly to the supermarkets and also setting up amateur small scale distribution centres in car parks of Countdown supermarkets. The dispute was resolved on 21 September 2006 when Progressive Enterprises agreed to pay parity and a 4.5% wage increase. Background In 2003 Progressive closed its Auckland and Christchurch distribution centers and rehired the redundant workers on lower pay, the closures ended the former national agreement and resulted in a NZ$2.50 per hour pay gap between the four sites. On 25 November 2005 Progressive Enterprises was bought by Australian retailer Woolworths Limited, the country's largest private employer. On Friday 25 August 2006 workers at the Progressive Enterprises distribution centres began a 48 hour long strike in support of a nationwide collective agreement with equal pay rates and existing allowances combined into a site allowance of up to $2.50, an 8% pay rise and an extra week service leave. On the 28th they voted unanimously to extend the strike. Union organiser Stan Renwick stated \\"This strike has become much more than a fight between distribution workers and Progressive, it's becoming a fight between the communities of Mangere, Palmerston North and Christchurch and $1.1 billion dollars of Australian profit,\\" Following the strike the company locked out the workers indefinitely, calling the union demands unrealistic. Economic Effects On the 11th day of the lock out TVNZ reported that gaps on the shelves at Progressive owned supermarkets were becoming the norm. The company stated that it was confident it could keep most shelves stocked, though most customers interviewed by ONE News had noticed gaps. That same day a spokesperson for the company told the Gisborne Herald that there were certainly empty gaps on shelves at most supermarkets, although this was not having an impact on sales, with customers substituting out of stock items for different brands. One National Distribution Union employee has claimed that the company was paying more than three times what it would normally pay for distribution during the lock-out. As the dispute entered its third week the locked out workers started to feel the effects of missing three pay cheques, one locked out worker, Virginia Watson, told TVNZ that she was now relying on donations to feed her kids \\"It's really starting to hurt. The kids haven't had a decent meat and vegetable meal to eat for over a week now, been pretty hard for them.\\" Progressive Enterprises estimated that the workers had collectively lost over $2 million in wages during the dispute. On 24 October The Press reported that the dispute \\"took a toll on Australian parent company Woolworths, which reported flat sales in New Zealand for the first quarter\\"'Lockout proves costly' The Press Thursday, 24 October 2006 C1 On the picket lines Picketing workers in Christchurch stopping a Linfox truck Progressive Enterprises workers, along with supporters, kept up continuous around-the-clock pickets at the distribution centres, as well as going out on \\"flying pickets\\" targeting the temporary distribution points set up by the company at supermarkets and distribution firms where people are handling goods that would normally be handled at the distribution centers. at the Palmerston North distribution centre. A permanent presence was set up at the site, with tents, a power generator, fridge, barbecue and portaloo. A representative from the Postal Workers Union added a letterbox to the campsite, saying that postal workers would deliver messages of solidarity sent directly to the picketers. Numerous arrests were made during the dispute, on 28 August union negotiator Stan Renwick was arrested, in Lower Hutt three picketers who were not employed by Progressive Enterprises were arrested at a Countdown supermarket after a stand off with a truck driver. During the third week of the dispute ten people were arrested on the picket line in Auckland after truck tires were punctured during a clash between picketers and a moving truck, National Distribution Union organiser Ingrid Beckers, who was one of the people arrested, told the New Zealand Herald that the truck had driven dangerously through the picket line and that the driver unwound his window and swung a metal pole around. According to Senior Sergeant Cornell Kluessien \\"Some were charged with disorderly behaviour, some with obstructing police and some with obstructing a roadway.\\" Reaction to the Dispute From the union movement At a special affiliates meeting of the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions, the organisation representing 350,000 New Zealand union members, a resolution was passed condemning the lock out and supporting the claims of distribution workers, resolving \\"That each union, separately and collectively, will continue to take every possible action to support the NDU, the EPMU and their distribution worker members to achieve a fair settlement of their dispute\\". The Maritime Union of New Zealand issued a statement pledging \\"financial, practical and moral support for the workers and their pickets\\" and threatened to stop unloading supermarket goods at the wharves. They also worked to gain international support for the locked out workers, including from the International Transport Workers Federation, which represents 4,500,000 transport workers in 142 countries. Maritime union members voted to each contribute one hour of pay to the locked out worker fund each week until the dispute was settled. Over $425,000 was raised by the unions to support the locked out workers, a big part of this was $30,000 a week from one Auckland workplace with 1500 unionised staff and large donations from Australian unions the Maritime Union of Australia, the Transport Workers' Union and the Rail Tram and Bus Union. On 18 September representatives of these unions travelled to New Zealand to join the picket likes. At an executive board meeting held in Singapore on 14–16 September, the ICFTU-APRO, part of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions representing 30 million workers in the Asia-Pacific region condemned what it saw as \\"This heavy-handed pressure by a major corporate employer to force low-paid workers to relinquish their right to bargain collectively as guaranteed by ILO Conventions and New Zealand law.\\" From the business community Business lobby groups Business New Zealand and the Employers and Manufacturers Association both expressed concern that the dispute reflected a new style of ideological union claims, such as the claim for a national collective agreement. Employers and Manufacturers Associations Chief Executive Alasdair Thompson told National Radio \\"If they were to pull this off, then it could well lead to other situations where other employers who operate nationally see this sort of thing tried out against them.\\" Business New Zealand chief executive Phil O'Reilly stated \\"I think the Progressive dispute is a very public way station of a trend towards more of this. The claim's not just about money, it's about structural stuff and bargaining issues that employers will find quite difficult to agree to,\\" and claimed that if unions continue this approach to negotiations it would undoubtedly lead to more industrial disputes. An editorial in the Nelson Mail called the dispute \\"a disturbing reminder of the past, when unions had the power to shut down an entire industry - and sometimes used it.\\" Political response The government did not make any official statement about the dispute, however one individual cabinet minister, Steve Maharey, whose electorate includes the Palmerston North distribution centre made a token donation of $200 to the unions locked out worker fund. EPMU leader Andrew Little challenged all members of parliament to match or beat this donation, though none did. The opposition National Party put out a press release critical of the workers, mistakenly calling the industrial dispute a 'strike' when it was actually a lockout. The Green Party urged the public to boycott Progressive Enterprises supermarkets until the dispute was resolved. The party's industrial relations spokesperson Sue Bradford stated in a press release \\"The Green Party is totally behind the locked-out workers. The right to form national collective agreements is a basic one which workers in many other industries have successfully attained. It is appalling to see Progressive Enterprises applying such brute economic force to prevent its workers from negotiating one,\\" The Alliance supported the locked out workers by donating $500 and encouraging members of the party to match that donation. It also criticised the Labour government for remaining silent during the dispute. and The Workers Party produced and distributed a bulletin supporting the locked out workers, and encouraging the public to donate to the locked out worker fund. Socialist Worker raised $250 at a community picket of Foodtown Onehunga, and its activists in the Solidarity Union manned the picket line most days during the strike. The Workers' Charter newspaper published extensive coverage in its pages, also helping to raise the need for workers to challenge the ERA's anti strike laws and deliver illegal solidarity strike action to support those locked out. Settlement Both sides of the dispute claimed victory when an agreement was reached between the company and the two unions representing its employees on 21 September. The majority of workers in Auckland and Palmerston North voted to accept the company's offer, however, the vote in Christchurch was close. The unions did not achieve one collective agreement for all three centres but NDU secretary Laila Harre said the terms were the same; \\"The most important thing for these workers was using their national bargaining power to deliver equal pay for equal work and they've done a stunning job of that,\\" The agreement allowed for a 4.5% pay rise and pay parity between the four distribution centres by the end of 2008. Different sites' shift and roster systems were preserved but the system of allowances was streamlined to comprise a single base rate. The company also made available interest free loans of up to $1,000 to union members affected by the lock-out. After the dispute In Christchurch a small group of workers refused to go back to work the day after a settlement was reached, instead going back to work the following Monday. NDU delegate Karl Skivington told National Radio that 49 per cent of workers there voted against accepting the deal from Progressive, and that many of them were \\"still angry\\" and in no mood to rush back to work for employers who had locked them out. On 12 October The Press reported that Marty Hamnett who had been CEO of Progressive Enterprises during the dispute, was leaving his position to \\"return to work in Australia for family reasons\\"\\"Hamnett to go\\" The Press Thursday, 12 October 2006 B4 Negotiations between Progressive Enterprises employees at the Southmore Meat Processing Plant represented by The Meat Workers Union continued after a settlement was reached for the workers at distribution centers, as of 20 October union negotiators had just come out of mediation with a deal to take back to the membership to be voted on. At the end of the year, each of the workers received a $100 Christmas bonus from their union, funded from the donations that came in after the dispute ended. On 21 March 2007 Progressive Enterprises was awarded the 2006 Roger Award, an award given by the organisations Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa and GATT Watchdog for the worst transnational corporation Operating In New Zealand.

The area has a very large population of marine mammals, such as elephant seals, harbor seals, sea otters and sea lions, which are favored prey of great white sharks.www.pbs.org Around thirty-eight percent of recorded great white shark attacks on humans in the United States have occurred within the Red Triangle—eleven percent of the worldwide total. The area encompasses the beaches of the heavily populated San Francisco Bay Area, and many people enjoy surfing, windsurfing, swimming and diving in these waters. Geography The Red Triangle is defined by its vertices: the northern vertex is Bodega Bay (Bodega Head), the western vertex is the Farallones, and the southern vertex is Big Sur or Monterey Bay. The movement of sharks and other large marine animals in this region were studied starting in 1999 under the Tagging of Pacific Predators (TOPP) program, an international collaboration. TOPP found that white sharks in the Red Triangle are genetically distinct from others in the Pacific Ocean, such as those found off South Africa and Australia. Schedule The population of northeastern Pacific white sharks tend to congregate along the north/central California coast each fall, then leave the area in December for the deep ocean approximately halfway between California and Hawaii in a region that TOPP researchers have called the White Shark Café. Female whites tend to visit the Gulf of the Farallones every two years, which researchers believe to be based on the shark reproductive cycle.

Mammals of the World: A checklist. New Haven: A & C Black. . or bristly mouse, is a nocturnal rodent species from South America in the genus Neacomys. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, where it often lives in transition areas between lowland forest and open regions. Its diet consists of insects, seeds and fruit. Taxonomy This species was first described by the British zoologist Oldfield Thomas in 1882. Three subspecies are recognised; N. s. spinosus, from the Andean foothills of Peru; N. s. carceloni, from the Andean foothills of Colombia and Ecuador; and N. s. amoenas, from the Amazon basin of western Brazil. Description Neacomys spinosus is the largest mouse in the genus, with a head-and-body length of . The dorsal colouring is variable, with individuals from the central and western parts of its range being pale yellowish-brown mixed with black, or dark reddish-brown, whereas those from further east, in Mato Grosso state, are a brighter, more ochre colour. There are short, grooved spines mixed in with the rather coarse fur on the back and the underparts are a pale colour. The skull is more robust than in other species in the genus and is long, with a relatively slender braincase. Distribution and habitat N. spinosus has a very wide distribution encompassing much of the Amazon basin and the eastern foothills of the Andes. Its range extends from central and western Brazil to southeastern Colombia, eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru and central and northern Bolivia. It mostly inhabits moist lowland, broad-leafed, forest as well as well as forested hilly areas at elevations of up to . It also occurs in more open locations on the edges of lowland forests, in secondary growth, in cultivated ground and gardens. In Brazil its range is shared with Neacomys minutus and Neacomys musseri. Ecology This mouse is nocturnal and feeds on such things as seeds, fruits and insects. Breeding seems to take place throughout the year, but may peak at the start of the wet season. The litter size varies from two to four young. Status The species has a very wide range and is described as common. The population size exhibits large swings at different times of year, but the mouse is tolerant of habitat modification and no particular threats have been recognised, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

Strong is currently a defensive analyst for Alabama. Prior to that he was most recently the head coach at the University of South Florida. He held numerous assistant coaching positions before becoming head coach at the University of Louisville in 2010. During his four-year stint at Louisville, he led the Cardinals to a 37–15 record and reached a bowl game each season, including the 2013 Sugar Bowl. After the 2013 season he left Louisville to become the head coach at the University of Texas. He was fired by Texas after the 2016 season with a 16–21 record in three seasons. One month after leaving Texas, Strong was hired at South Florida where he led the Bulls to a 21-16 record before being fired in 2019. Early life Charles Rene Strong was born in Batesville, Arkansas, one of six children of mother Delois Ramsey. Strong's father, also named Charles Strong, was a teacher and coach in Luxora, Arkansas and never married Ramsey. The younger Strong grew up in a blended household with his aunt and aunt's six children. After lettering for four years (1980–1983) as a defensive back at the University of Central Arkansas, Strong joined the University of Florida coaching staff as a graduate assistant in 1983. He later served as a graduate assistant at Texas A&M; in 1985. He received a master's degree from Henderson State Universityhttp://kentuckypreps.rivals.com/viewcoach.asp?Coach=288 and also received a master's degree and education specialist degree from the University of Florida. He is a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. Coaching career Early positions Strong's first full-time coaching job was at Southern Illinois in 1986, where he coached wide receivers. He later assumed defensive coaching duties at Florida, Ole Miss, and Notre Dame. South Carolina In 1999, Strong joined the South Carolina Gamecocks as defensive coordinator. His stifling defenses and charismatic personality created buzz that he would be possibly the first black head coach in the SEC, but job offers were slim. Sylvester Croom eventually broke the color barrier in the SEC coaching ranks in 2004.Chris Low, \\" Croom's legacy continuing to open doors,\\" ESPN (January 20, 2014). Retrieved September 30, 2014. Florida Strong was hired as defensive coordinator for the Florida Gators before the 2003 season. Florida head coach Ron Zook was fired midway through the Gators' 2004 season, but continued to coach until the bowl game; Strong served as interim coach of the Gators for one game, the December 2004 Peach Bowl. Florida lost the game, 27–10, to Miami. When Urban Meyer was hired as Florida's head coach, Strong was the only assistant coach retained from Zook's staff. In a January 2009 interview with the Orlando Sentinel, Strong expressed his belief that race played a large part in the reason that he hadn't been offered a head coaching job in 2009. Strong, whose wife is white, especially cited prospective employers' discomfort with his interracial marriage.\\"Florida Coach Charlie Strong Believes that Race Affected Opportunities,\\" Sports Illustrated (January 6, 2009). Strong was a 2009 finalist for the Broyles Award, given annually to the nation's top assistant coach. Louisville He became the 21st head football coach at the University of Louisville on December 9, 2009. In a telephone interview that day with ESPN.com columnist Pat Forde, former Indianapolis Colts head coach Tony Dungy said of Strong, \\"When they see what he can do, you're probably going to have a lot of people disappointed they didn't hire him sooner.\\" Strong led Louisville to a victory in the 2013 Sugar Bowl over his former team, the Florida Gators, by a final score of 33–23. It was the biggest upset victory in terms of point spread in any BCS bowl game since the inception of the BCS in 1998, as Florida entered the game favored by almost two touchdowns. On January 23, 2013, Strong was given a $1.4 million raise which brought his annual compensation to $3.7 million and raised his buyout to $5 million. At the time it made him 7th highest paid active coach in college football and highest paid coach outside the SEC, Big 12, and Big Ten conferences. Texas On January 5, 2014, the University of Texas announced that Strong would be leaving the University of Louisville to accept the head football coach position at Texas to replace Mack Brown. Strong's 5-year contract was worth $5 million annually. He was formally introduced as Texas' 29th head coach the next day and became the first black head coach of the Texas football program. Strong with George W. Bush and Jesse Jackson in April 2014 UT Athletic Director Steve Patterson and UT President Bill Powers stated their reasons for hiring Strong for the head coaching position was due to Strong's commitment to the tradition of the UT Football program as well as the development of the student-athletes. Strong discussed his devotion to his athletes in his first press conference as the head coach of Texas, \\"I want to see [the players] develop on the field as well as off the field...The program is always going to be about physical and mental toughness.\\" In his first training camp as Longhorns coach, Strong suspended or dismissed a number of players for legal and disciplinary reasons. Players went to training camp with blank white helmets and Strong said they would have to earn the right to have the Longhorn logo on them. Texas under Strong started 2–4, which included a 20–17 nail biter defeat to #12 UCLA and 31–26 close loss to #11 Oklahoma. The Longhorns rallied and finished 6–6, which included an upset win at home versus #23 West Virginia, 33–16, and a 48–45 shootout home win against Iowa State, Strong's first shootout win in the Big 12. A 41–7 loss to BYU at home, 28–7 loss to #7 Baylor at home, 23–0 shutout by #10 Kansas State in Manhattan, and a 48–10 home loss to #5 TCU proved to be blemishes to Strong's first season in Austin. Under Strong, the Longhorns earned a bowl bid in his first season. On renewing an old Southwest Conference rivalry, playing against Arkansas in the Advocare V100 Texas Bowl in Houston, Strong commented, \\"I grew up in Arkansas, grew up an Arkansas fan because it's a major university in the state,\\" Strong said. \\"So many memorable games. Like I said, the '69 game was an unbelievable game. Growing up around it, you just know how big it was and how important it is to so many people.\\" Texas lost the game by a score of 31–7. In 2015, Strong's coaching staff got a top-10, recruiting class, competing with rivals Texas A&M;, Baylor, Texas Tech and TCU in in- state recruiting. During the spring, the coaches switched the offense to a spread offense, as the quarterbacks Strong recruits are used to this style since it is extensively used in high school, Strong noted. Strong's first upset win against a top 10 team at Texas was in the Red River Showdown in his second year, beating Oklahoma 24–17. Strong had begun the season 1–4, and coming into the game, the Longhorns program was noted by multiple national media outlets as being in trouble. The Longhorns dominated the rushing attack with 313 yards on the ground and had two players rush for over 100 yards in the game. Both players (QB Jerrod Heard and RB D'Onta Foreman) were in their second years, signalling the success of Strong's recruiting at Texas. After the victory, the players picked up Strong and crowd-surfed him in the middle of the field, then Strong posed for photos wearing the Golden Hat. Texas would finish 5–7, not eligible for a bowl game, but ended the season on a high note upsetting No. 12 Baylor. The offseason saw Strong bring in another offensive coordinator in Sterlin Gilbert from Tulsa, and a top-10 recruiting class. Texas started their 2016 campaign against No. 10 Notre Dame at home, in which Strong started freshman QB Shane Buechele and Tyrone Swoopes scored the game- winning touchdown to upset Notre Dame in 2OT. In the following AP poll, Texas was ranked for the first time under Strong, at No. 11. Strong finished the 2016 season with a losing record of 5–7, the third season in a row he had guided the University of Texas football program to a losing season, after inheriting a program from Mack Brown who had achieved an 8–5 record in 2013 and winning records in 15 of 16 seasons at Texas. The low point of the 2016 campaign came in the next-to-last game of the season when the Longhorns blew a 21–10 lead in a 24–21 overtime loss to a Kansas team that had won only one game all season beforehand. On November 26, 2016, Strong was fired from his position as head coach. South Florida On December 11, 2016, Strong was named as the fourth head coach of the University of South Florida.

It is used today by North American Amish congregations. History The core of the Ausbund is based on fifty-one songs written by Anabaptists from Passau, Bavaria. Eleven of these songs were written by their leader, Michael Schneider. Twelve others may have been written by Hans Betz. The hymns were composed in the dungeon of Passau Castle, where the Anabaptists were imprisoned between 1535 and 1540 because of their convictions. Some—among them Hans Betz—did not survive the imprisonment. Many of these imprisoned Anabaptists were martyred. The collection was printed in 1564. A copy of this first printing is found at the Mennonite Historical Library of Goshen College, bearing the title Etliche schöne christliche Gesäng wie dieselbigen zu Passau von den Schweizer Brüdern in der Gefenknus im Schloss durch göttliche Gnade gedicht und gesungen warden. Ps. 139 (Several Beautiful Christian Songs Which Were Written and Sung Through God's Grace by the Swiss Brethren in the Passau Castle Prison). The printed hymnal must have been widely circulated. By the Frankenthaler Colloquiums (1571) it was already used as a source of criticism by opponents of Anabaptism. Another edition of the hymnal with eighty more songs appeared in 1583. This is the first edition where the word Ausbund appears on the title page: Ausbund. Das ist etliche schöne christenliche Lieder, etc. Allen und jeden Christen, welcher Religion sie seien, unpartheyisch nützlich. Later editions included 137 (Europe) and 140 (North America) songs. In all there are eleven known European editions of the Ausbund. In the 16th and 17th centuries the hymnals were published in Cologne and the Rhineland. In the 18th and 19th centuries new editions appeared in Basel und Strasbourg. The last European edition was printed in Basel in 1838. The first American Ausbund appeared in 1742 and was printed at Christopher Saur's Germantown press. Mennonite Bishop Henry Funck was the publisher of this hymnal, which was used until the end of the 18th century by the Swiss Mennonite churches. It was replaced by Die kleine geistliche Harfe and Unpartheyisches Gesangbuch of 1804, both from Pennsylvania. The Ausbund is now exclusively used in Amish worship, preserving the unique spirit of the 17th- century Anabaptists. A number of the hymns have been translated into English both in book reference form and also set to music as found in the Christian Hymnary where it is used in many Conservative Mennonite worship services. Characteristics The oldest songs from the Ausbund are mainly about the suffering church in a hostile environment. At the center stand those serious Christians who are prepared to die for their faith. They reflect not only grief and despair, but also the understanding of God's presence. There are always more reasons to thank God as one pours out their troubles. Among others, song number 131, O Gott, Vater, wir loben dich und deine Güte preisen wir (O God, Father, we praise you and your kindness we praise), today is sung at beginning of each Amish worship service. Content The first song of the Ausbund is from the pen of Sebastian Franck. The song teaches that Christians should sing in spirit and truth, pray and praise God with Psalms. The second song is an adaptation of the Athanasian Creed. Songs 6, 7 and 8 are written by Felix Manz, Michael Sattler and Hans Hut, all Anabaptist martyrs. Other martyr songs are by Leonhard Schiemer, Hans Schlaffer, George Blaurock and Hans Leupold, who were among the victims of the first great persecution of Anabaptists. Hans Büchl, participant in the Frankenthaler Colloquiums, is the writer of five Ausbund songs. Eleven songs are of Dutch origin. The Dutch Anabaptists wrote another eleven songs. Five songs are from the Bohemian Brothers. Many of Ausbund songs have a teaching character: Bible lessons, the Anabaptist views on believers baptism, the Lord's Supper and a focus on eschatology. Songs in this last topic include Büchl's (Nr. 46): Ain new christelich Lied von der gegenwardig schröcklichen letzten Dagen, in welchen so vil verschieden secten, auffrührerisch und falsche Propheten erschainen, auch blutdirstige tyrannen (A new Christian song from the current terrible last days, in which many different sects, rebellious and false prophets and bloodthirsty tyrants appear). Until 1809 the European Ausbund was distributed with no indication of location or publisher. From 1692 the government of Bern forbade the distribution or possession of this hymnal and ordered its confiscation under threat of severe punishment. The American edition contains the confession of faith of Thomas von Imbroich (1558) entitled Wahrhaftigen Bericht über die große Trübsal, die die Geschwister rund um Zürich für ihre Glaubenssache zwischen 1635 und 1645 zu erleiden hatten (a collection of martyr stories). From a literary viewpoint the content of the Ausbund is of limited quality, yet witnesses of a deep religious belief and sacrificial devotion of the believers. Music The Ausbund contains no notes; most of the songs were sung to popular melodies. According to the research of G. P. Jackson, some melodies came from folk and love songs and others from chorales and hymns. The oldest melodies are from the 13th and 14th centuries. As with most Christian hymnbooks, the Amish normally use the Ausbund only in church. Their traditional melodies are called \\"slow tunes\\", but they put other melodies on the words during singing. Author Joseph Yoder compared the slow tempo of the music as it is sung today to Gregorian Chant, but this was not always the case. The Amish slow tunes of the 20th century are probably descended from tunes that the original Anabaptists knew. But over time, and with neither written notation nor musical instruments to keep the beat, the tunes have slowed down and ornamentation has been added in.

It is a form of multiway branch. The branch table construction is commonly used when programming in assembly language but may also be generated by compilers, especially when implementing optimized switch statements whose values are densely packed together. Typical implementation A branch table consists of a serial list of unconditional branch instructions that is branched into using an offset created by multiplying a sequential index by the instruction length (the number of bytes in memory occupied by each branch instruction). It relies on the fact that machine code instructions for branching have a fixed length and can be executed extremely efficiently by most hardware, and is most useful when dealing with raw data values that may be easily converted to sequential index values. Given such data, a branch table can be extremely efficient. It usually consists of the following 3 steps: # optionally validating the input data to ensure it is acceptable (this may occur without cost as part of the next step, if the input is a single byte and a 256 byte translate table is used to directly obtain the offset below). Also, if there is no doubt about the values of the input, this step can be omitted. # transform the data into an offset into the branch table. This usually involves multiplying or shifting (effectively multiplying by a power of 2) it to take into account the instruction length. If a static translate table is used, this multiplying can be performed manually or by the compiler, without any run time cost. # branching to an address made up of the base address of the branch table plus the just generated offset. This sometimes involves an addition of the offset onto the program counter register (unless, in some instruction sets, the branch instruction allows an extra index register). This final address usually points to one of a sequence of unconditional branch instructions, or the instruction immediately beyond them (saving one entry in the table). The following pseudocode illustrates the concept ... validate x /* transform x to 0 (invalid) or 1,2,3, according to value..) */ y = x * 4; /* multiply by branch instruction length (e.g. 4 ) */ goto next + y; /* branch into 'table' of branch instructions */ /* start of branch table */ next: goto codebad; /* x= 0 (invalid) */ goto codeone; /* x= 1 */ goto codetwo; /* x= 2 */ ... rest of branch table codebad: /* deal with invalid input */ Alternative implementation using addresses Another method of implementing a branch table is with an array of pointers from which the required function's address is retrieved. This method is also more recently known under such different names as \\"dispatch table\\" or \\"virtual method table\\" but essentially performing exactly the same purpose. This pointer function method can result in saving one machine instruction, and avoids the indirect jump (to one of the branch instructions). The resulting list of pointers to functions is almost identical to direct threaded code, and is conceptually similar to a control table. The actual method used to implement a branch table is usually based on: * the architecture of the processor on which the code is to be executed, * whether it is a compiled or interpreted language and * whether late binding is involved or not. History Use of branch tables and other raw data encoding was common in the early days of computing when memory was expensive, CPUs were slower and compact data representation and efficient choice of alternatives were important. Nowadays, they are commonly still used in: * embedded programming * operating system development. In many operating systems, both system calls and library functions may be referenced by an integer index into a branch table. * some computer architectures such as IBM/360 use branch tables for dispatching interrupts Advantages Advantages of branch tables include: * compact code structure (despite repeated branch opcodes) * reduced source statements (versus repetitive \`If\` statements) * reduced requirement to test return codes individually (if used at call site to determine subsequent program flow) * Algorithmic and code efficiency (data need only be encoded once and branch table code is usually compact), and the potential to attain high data compression ratios. For example, when compressing country names to country codes, a string such as \\"Central African Republic\\" can be compressed to a single index, resulting in large savings – particularly when the string appears many times. In addition, this same index can be used to access related data in separate tables, reducing storage requirements further. For library functions, where they may be referenced by an integer: * improve compatibility with subsequent software versions. If the code of a function and the address of its entry point is changed, only the branch instruction in the branch table needs to be adjusted; application software compiled against the library, or for the operating system, does not need modification. In addition, calling functions by number (the index into the table) can sometimes be useful in some cases in normal application programming. Disadvantages * Extra level of indirection * Restrictions in some programming languages (although there are usually alternative ways of implementing the basic concept of multiway branching). Example A simple example of branch table use in the 8-bit Microchip PIC assembly language is: movf INDEX,W ; Move the index value into the W (working) register from memory addwf PCL,F ; add it to the program counter. Each PIC instruction is one byte ; so there is no need to perform any multiplication. ; Most architectures will transform the index in some way before ; adding it to the program counter. table ; The branch table begins here with this label goto index_zero ; each of these goto instructions is an unconditional branch goto index_one ; of code. goto index_two goto index_three index_zero ; Code is added here to perform whatever action is required when INDEX = zero return index_one ... Note: this code will work only if PCL < (table + index_last). To ensure this condition we may use an \\"org\\" directive. And if GOTO (PIC18F for example) is 2 bytes, this limits the number of table entries to less than 128. Jump table example in C Another simple example, this time demonstrating a jump table rather than a mere branch table. This allows program blocks outside of the currently active procedure/function to be called: #include #include typedef void (*Handler)(void); /* A pointer to a handler function */ /* The functions */ void func3 (void) { printf( \\"3 \\" ); } void func2 (void) { printf( \\"2 \\" ); } void func1 (void) { printf( \\"1 \\" ); } void func0 (void) { printf( \\"0 \\" ); } Handler jump_table[4] = {func0, func1, func2, func3}; int main (int argc, char **argv) { int value; /* Convert first argument to 0-3 integer (modulus) */ value = ((atoi(argv[1]) % 4) + 4) % 4; /* Call appropriate function (func0 thru func3) */ jump_table[value](); return 0; } Jump table example in PL/I PL/I implements a jump table as an array of label variables. These may be initialized in an unusual way by using a subscripted statement label. PL/I label variables are not simply the address of the statement, but usually contain additional information on the state of the code block to which they belong. Without the unusual initialization, this could also be coded with calls and an array of entry variables. declare lab (10) label; declare x fixed binary; goto lab(x); lab(1): /* code for choice 1 */ ; ... lab(2): /* code for choice 2 */ ; ... Compiler generated branch tables Programmers frequently leave the decision of whether or not to create a branch table to the compiler, believing that it is perfectly capable of making the correct choice from the known search keys. This may be true for optimizing compilers for relatively simple cases where the range of search keys is limited. However, compilers are not as intelligent as humans and cannot have a deep knowledge of 'context', believing that a range of possible search key integer values such as 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 20, 23, 40, 42, 50 & 1000 would generate a branch table with an excessively large number of empty entries (900+) for very little advantage. (A good optimizing compiler may then presort the values and generate code for a binary chop search, as a 'second best' option.) In fact, the application may be highly \\"time critical\\" and memory requirement may not really be an issue at all. However, a little 'common sense' can transform this particular case, and many other similar cases, to a simple two-step process with very large potential savings – while still eventually leaving the ultimate choice to the compiler – but 'assisting its decision' considerably: * First, test for search key=1000 and perform appropriate branch. * Allow the compiler to 'choose' to generate a branch table on the remaining search keys (1-50). Variations along similar lines can be used in cases where there are two sets of short ranges with a large gap between ranges. Computed GoTo While the technique is now known as 'branch tables', early compiler users called the implementation 'computed GoTo', referring to the instruction found in the Fortran series of compilers. The instruction was eventually deprecated in Fortran 90 (in favour of SELECT & CASE statements at the source level). Creating the index for the branch table Where there is no obvious integer value available for a branch table it can nevertheless be created from a search key (or part of a search key) by some form of arithmetic transformation, or could simply be the row number of a database or the entry number in an array containing the search key found during earlier validation of the key. A hash table may be required to form the index in some cases. However, for single byte input values such as A-Z (or the first byte of a longer key), the contents of the byte itself (raw data) can be used in a two-step, \\"trivial hash function\\", process to obtain a final index for a branch table with zero gaps. # Convert the raw data character to its numeric equivalent (example ASCII 'A' > 65 decimal, 0x41 hexadecimal) # Use the numeric integer value as index into a 256 byte array, to obtain a second index (invalid entries 0; representing gaps, otherwise 1, 2, 3 etc.) The array would be no larger than (256 x 2) bytes – to hold all possible 16-bit unsigned (short) integers. If no validation is required, and only upper case is used, the size of the array may be as small as (26 x 2) = 52 bytes. Other uses of technique Although the technique of branching using a branch table is most frequently utilized solely for the purpose of altering program flow – to jump to a program label that is an unconditional branch – the same technique can be used for other purposes. For example, it can be used to select a starting point in a sequence of repeated instructions where drop through is the norm and intentional. This can be used for example by optimizing compilers or JIT compilers in loop unrolling.

C. Crispin, set in the fictional Star Trek universe. It is set shortly after the motion picture Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. Ambassador Sarek of Vulcan discovers evidence of a complicated plot to cripple the United Federation of Planets; he must work to find out who is behind it while also coming to terms with the death of his human wife, Amanda Grayson. A secondary storyline follows the adventures of Peter Kirk, nephew of James T. Kirk, who inadvertently becomes caught up in the enemy's schemes. Plot synopsis Sarek discovers that leaders of the Federation and its enemies have been subjected to outside mental influence. He suspects that the interference is linked to the Freelans, a race which has been part of the Federation for decades, but which no offworlder has ever seen due to a cultural taboo. Sarek once inadvertently discovered that the Freelans look like Vulcans, but later dismissed the incident as a hallucination induced by the Pon farr. After secretly accessing the Freelan computer system, Sarek discovers that the Freelans are in fact Romulans, and that their Vulcan aides are the children of Vulcan spacefarers kidnapped by the Romulans and forced to reproduce. The Freelan ambassador Taryn is actually the Romulan wing commander in charge of the plot to spy on the Federation from within. The mental influencing of various leaders is carried out by the Vulcan aides, who were raised as Romulans without the telepathic ethics taught on Vulcan. Sarek's work is interrupted by the news that his wife, Amanda, is terminally ill. Although he returns to Vulcan to be with her, he is soon called upon to negotiate for the release of a colony world held hostage by a Klingon renegade. He agrees, even though he will not be able to return before his wife's death. His son Spock, who believes his father's first duty is to the family, becomes angry when he learns of this decision, and the feud between them that ended in the episode \\"Journey to Babel\\" threatens to reassert itself. Sarek succeeds in the negotiations and discovers that the Klingon commander Keraz who led the raid is also a victim of the Romulans' mental influence. When Sarek returns to Vulcan for Amanda's funeral, he shares his findings with Kirk, Spock, and Dr. Leonard McCoy, and Kirk agrees to take him to Freelan aboard the Enterprise. The Captain's own plans are to leave the ship to rescue his nephew Peter, a senior cadet at Starfleet Academy who has been kidnapped by the renegade Klingon Kamarag in order to lure Kirk into a trap. Kamarag, acting under the mental influence of the Freelans, is the leader of the renegade Klingons who defy the orders of the female Klingon Chancellor Azetbur. Peter is brought to the Klingon homeworld Qo'noS and placed in the care of Kamarag's niece Valdyr, who believes her uncle's actions are dishonorable but who is bound by her secondary status as a woman to follow his orders. She is impressed by Peter's bravery and strength when he overpowers several Klingon warriors in an attempt to break out, even after five days of starvation. Over the course of Peter's imprisonment, the two fall in love and eventually escape together. As they approach a Klingon spaceport intending to hijack a ship, they meet up with Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, who had intended to rescue the cadet. The five of them manage to steal a miniature Klingon Bird-of-Prey and escape back to the Enterprise. A Romulan ship is discovered just inside the neutral zone, and Sarek realizes that ship must be under the command of Taryn. Sarek and Spock beam over to the Romulan ship in an attempt to acquire incontrovertible proof that the Romulans are involved. While attempting to forestall an attack against the Enterprise, Sarek accepts Taryn's challenge to an ancient form of duel that predates the division of the Vulcan and Romulan cultures. The duel is fought with the senapa, a curved sword with a poisoned blade. Sarek is cut and exposed to the poison but manages to win the duel despite Taryn's advantages of size and youth. Both men are beamed to the Enterprise where they are treated by Dr. McCoy. With the help of the Romulan ship and a single Klingon ship that deserts the renegades, the Enterprise emerges victorious from a conflict with Kamarag's fleet. War between the Federation and the Klingon Empire is averted and the Romulan plot is foiled. Peter is required to complete the Kobayashi Maru simulation test upon his return to the Academy, since his missed taking it with the rest of his class. Despite engineering a better-than-usual solution to the scenario, Peter decides to leave Starfleet for the diplomatic corps instead. Points of note The novel explores the history of Sarek's relationship with Amanda through the device of select entries in Amanda's journal, which prompt flashbacks in the mind of the character reading them. When Sarek tells Spock about his one face-to-face encounter with a Freelan, he mentions that the face he saw greatly resembled his own. Spock then describes his own first glimpse of a Romulan, which took place during the episode \\"Balance of Terror.\\" He mentions that the Romulan Commander encountered by the Enterprise also strongly resembled Sarek. This is something of an inside joke, referring to the fact that the role of the Romulan Commander in \\"Balance of Terror\\" and the role of Sarek were both played by the actor Mark Lenard. Peter Kirk, who first appeared as a child in the episode \\"Operation: Annihilate!\\", is fully developed as an adult character in this novel. The senapa appears to have been invented by the author, although she may be referring to the large, semicircular bladed weapon carried by the executioner in the episode \\"Amok Time\\". Early in the novel, the author describes the interior of Sarek and Amanda's home. One of the paintings on the wall is of an icy world with a large, red sun. This seems to be an intentional reference to a painting described in Crispin's first novel, Yesterday's Son. Parts of the novel's plot provide a setup for events that occur in Star Trek: The Next Generation.

Panikkar too did not return since he decided to return only after finding Unni. Ammu (Kavya Madhavan) is Panikkar's daughter who also believes, like master and his wife, that her father will return one day with Unni. The master finds Unni (Dileep) after years and brings him back to the Village. The villagers realize that Unni is abnormal and is mentally challenged. He behaves like a small boy and creates all sorts of trouble for the villagers and his parents. His main hobby is to snatch dhothi from people. He snatches the dhothi after aiming at it with a hand gesture resembling Okay gesture. This leads to a series of comical incidents in the village. He is given Ayurveda treatment under the guidance of the church priest (Jagathy Sreekumar). Ammu looks after Unni, which her cousin Gopikkuttan (Nishanth Sagar) objects to, as he loves her. Meanwhile, Panicker returns to the village. Gopikuttan tries to turn Panicker against Unni. Eventually, Ammu starts to love Unni and waits for his recovery to marry him. But finally Unni gets back his memory only to let out the truth that he is not Unni but Vishnu, the son of a Bangalore don Maheshwar Thampi(Thiagarajan). Vishnu disapproves Thampi's lifestyle so he lives away from his father. He falls in love with Gauri and decides to marry her against his father's wish.

He worked in the American League from 1984 to 1999 and has worked throughout Major League Baseball from 2000 to 2015. He had been a crew chief since 2000. Welke wore number 30 when he joined the American League staff, then switched to 3 after the AL and National League umpiring staffs merged in 2000. His brother Bill is also a major league umpire. Tim has umpired in four World Series, seven League Championship Series, eight Division Series and two All-Star Games. Minor league career A youth baseball umpire since the age of 16, Welke entered minor league umpiring in 1977. He appeared in the Gulf Coast League (1977), Florida State League (1978–79), Eastern League (1980), American Association (1981–83), Florida Instructional League (1977–80) and Dominican Winter League (1981–83) prior to his major league promotion in 1984. MLB career Welke umpired in the World Series in 1996, 2000, 2003, and 2008. He also worked the League Championship Series in 1991, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2011; and the Division Series in 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, 2003, 2008, 2010, and 2013. He served as crew chief for the NLCS in 2004 and 2006, the ALCS in 2011 and the ALDS in 1995 and 2000. He was also the crew chief for the 2008 World Series. He umpired in the All-Star Game in 1990, 2005, and 2015. Welke spent 2005 and 2008-2010 on the same umpiring crew as his brother Bill. Notable games On April 29, 1986, he was the first base umpire when Roger Clemens of the Boston Red Sox achieved a record 20 strikeouts against the Seattle Mariners. Welke ejected Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox from game six of the 1996 World Series. Welke was also the first base umpire for Roy Halladay's perfect game on May 29, 2010; coincidentally, his brother Bill worked at third base that same game. In a May 2, 2012 game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Colorado Rockies at Coors Field, Welke made a controversial out call at first base against Jerry Hairston, Jr. though first baseman Todd Helton's foot came well off the bag. Welke later admitted that he had missed the call. Hairston subsequently defended Welke and described him as \\"a really good umpire for a long time.\\" He served as crew chief for the 2014 Opening Series in Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground.Imber, Gil. \\"Roster: 2014 Opening Series (Sydney, Australia) Umpires.\\" Close Call Sports/Umpire Ejection Fantasy League.

Life and career Born in Armadale, Western Australia, the youngest of eight children of migrant Croatian parents, Vincent Serventy graduated from the University of Western Australia in geology and psychology. He was a CSIRO researcher and teacher before beginning a career as a writer, lecturer and film-maker. He joined the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) in 1942 and served as either its Branch Secretary or State Representative for Western Australia 1943–1959. In 1946 he became a life member of the Wildlife Preservation Society of Australia and was for many years its president. In 1956 he bought a movie camera and began making documentary films which later led to Australia's first television environment program, Nature Walkabout (1967).Stephens (2007) In 1974 he was awarded the Australian Natural History Medallion. In 1976 he was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia. In 1985 Vincent Serventy assisted the Conservation Council of WA in its unsuccessful campaign to stop a major road being built through the Trigg Regional Open Space. This public land had been identified by the System 6 Study Report to the Environmental Protection Authority as having important conservation value with the bushland extending from the sea to tuart and banksia woodland, a rarity in the metropolitan area. Vincent spoke publicly of the importance of this land for its vegetation, landforms and habitat for local fauna and migratory birds.

Skrabanek was a lifelong champion of clear thinking, scepticism, and critical appraisal, and he expressed vocal criticism of what he dubbed \\"cacademics\\", \\"quackupuncturists\\" and \\"nonsensus-consensus\\". Skrabanek was a polymath, loving jazz, history, literature, playing the piano. He spoke several languages thanks to which he was able to deeply study Joyce's last work - the avant-garde novel Finnegans Wake. Career Skrabanek studied chemistry, joining the faculty of Natural Sciences at Charles University in Prague in 1957. Following his studies he was a researcher at the Institute for Toxicology and Forensic Medicine in Prague, graduating in 1962. He also frequently contributed short articles to the Czechoslovakian science journal Vesmír (Cosmos). Beginning in 1963, Skrabanek studied medicine at the Jan Evangelista Purkyně University in Brno, and wrote abstracts from journals published in Slavonic languages for Chemical Abstracts. Later he worked as an expert in forensic toxicology in Prague. In 1967 Skrabanek was selected to spend a month in Galway Regional Hospital. When the Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia in July 1968, he and his wife Věra Čapková were on holiday in Ireland and they remained there as emigrants. Soon after, he was admitted to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland to finish his medical studies qualifying for practice in 1970. For the next four years he worked for the Medical Research Council laboratory and the department of internal medicine of Jervis Street Hospital. He left this post in 1975 to join the Endocrine oncology research team at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital as a senior research fellow, and as a leading specialist, he became involved in research into the neurotransmitter substance P. At the same time he completed his doctoral thesis \\"Inappropriate Production of Hormonal Peptides in Neoplasia\\". Starting in the late 1970s, Skrabanek dealt with wider medical questions of medicine. He wrote more than 300 articles, at first purely professional, but later he applied his broad knowledge towards commenting on current and general issues of medicine and science. He soon became a member of the Lancet Editorial Board and a valued, independent contributor. A number of his articles have been directed against mistakes and frauds in medicine and, above all, against charlatanism. In 1984, through Lancet, Skrabanek met his future colleague and collaborator James McCormick, who offered him a position at the Trinity College Dublin Department of Community Health with a grant from the Wellcome Foundation. Skrabanek later became a professor there, specializing in neuroendocrinology. From this position he \\"immediately began to establish his position as an original, cogent, and fearless critic, particularly in relation to preventive medicine.\\"While at Trinity, Skrabanek said \\"One of my duties is to protect people against the harm that over- enthusiastic doctors and misguided politicians can inflict upon them.\\" Skrabanek maintained his reputation as a stringent and scathing critic of dogmas, sham, and wishful thinking pertaining to the areas of preventive medicine and alternative medicine. In 1991, Skrabanek became a Fellow of board of directors of Trinity College and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. in 2018, he became the seventh recipient of the Stearne medal, awarded by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland to \\"persons of distinction who have made a contribution to medicine in Ireland\\". Major works  Follies and Fallacies in Medicine  Skrabanek's first book, which was co-authored by J. MacCormick, entitled \\"Follies and Fallacies in Medicine\\", was published in 1989. It had a broad response and was promptly translated into Danish, German, Spanish, Italian, French, Dutch and Czech, and is on the reading list of medical schools around the world, to encourage an appropriate skepticism about medical dogma. It was a critique against mistakes, delusions, myths and frauds in medicine and healing. The first chapter emphasizes the role of placebo as a little emphasized, but crucial element in medicine and healing. The importance of placebo is illustrated by numerous examples. In the second chapter, there are almost thirty different delusions and temptations, to which a doctor can succumb as a scientist and practitioner. A provocative chapter is one on prevention, the importance of which Skrabanek partly questions as he highlights possible risks. Another chapter is about alternative medicine, the validity of which he clearly rejects without tolerance or attempted reconciliation:  The Death of Humane Medicine  Even more controversial than Follies and Fallacies in Medicine is his last book, \\"The Death of Humane Medicine\\", subtitled \\"and the rise of coercive healthism\\". This was published in 1994, a year after Skrabanek's death, and had mixed reception; there was admiration and approval, but also sharp disagreement and resistance. In the book, Skrabanek comments on the current change in the understanding of medicine advocated by American and English medical societies and their governments. He says that the goal was no longer to help sick individuals, but to have a positive influence on the entire population. He writes that health ceases to be private and individual, instead becoming a moral duty, a new religion with priests and dogmas. Skrabanek also says that the state tries to interfere with the way of life, even against the wishes and interest of citizens. Skrabanek criticizes what he sees as the obsession with super-health, maximum prolongation of life, healthism and lifestylism, but especially with the coercion of the citizens to achieve these ideals. He disagrees with prohibitions of all kinds, with the fight against tobacco, obesity, alcohol consumption, and, on the contrary, the promotion of jogging and yogurt. Skrabanek goes so far as to see in this policy the continuation of the health policy of fascist Germany, and the totalitarian tendencies in the health of the Communist states,and says \\"The pursuit of health is a symptom of unhealth. When this pursuit is no longer a personal yearning but part of state ideology, healthism for short, it becomes a symptom of political sickness.\\" Skrabanek also relies on his criticism of the evidence that most of the preventive and screening actions are less effective, scientifically unsubstantiated, and are often only a manifestation of the desire of bureaucracy for power and the efforts of pharmaceutical companies to increase profits. He also points out the huge and ineffective cost of such actions.  Night Joyce of a Thousand Tiers  Skrabanek was deeply interested in languages. He learned several major European languages during his student years, and was private pupil of rabbi Richard Feder in Brno and learned Hebrew. While in Ireland he became interested in the Irish language and also Hiberno-English. He also learned Japanese. Skabanek began to systematically devote himself to Joyce's Finnegans Wake in the early 1970s. While in Czechoslovakia, he became acquainted with the early Czech translations of Dubliners (1933), A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1930) and Ulysses (1930). Skrabanek and his wife Věra decided to improve their basic knowledge of English by reading each day to each other several pages of Ulysses. Skrabanek's first encounter with Finnegans Wake was through an excerpt of the Anna Livia Plurabella section translated into Czech by Zdeněk Urbánek in 1966. He wrote his first article on Joyce in A Wake Newslitter in 1971. More articles followed, and Skrabanek became respected as an authority on Finnegans Wake. In the 1980s he began to hold seminars about Joyce's riddling text at University College Dublin. He focused mainly on the analysis of Joyce's work language components: his main contribution to the study of Joyce's literary experiment is the extensive dictionary of expressions taken from Slavic languages, but he also published articles about the use of Hebrew, Armenian, Japanese, Afar, and Irish English in Finnegans Wake. The article \\"Slavonicisms in Finnegans Wake\\" was originally published in Irish-Slavonic Studies. It was also reprinted in Litteraria Pragensia in the original English version. Skrabanek's contribution to the identification of Slavonicisms in the Wake cannot be overestimated. During the compilation of his Slavonic index, he was able to locate the elements from Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Serbo-Croatian, Slovenian and Bulgarian language. Collected articles about Finnegans Wake has been published under the title \\"Night Joyce of a Thousand Tiers: Petr Skrabanek Studies in Finnegans Wake\\". Response Three years after his death, the Skrabanek Foundation was established by his wife, friends and associates. Vera Capkova Skrabanek and James McCormick were company directors. The goal of the foundation was to provide a forum concerning general issues of medicine and ethics, along the lines of skeptical inquiry. The first interdisciplinary symposium held by the Foundation was held in May 1995 in Dublin. The foundation was dissolved in May 2005. Skrabanek was accused by the press of having been in the pay of the tobacco industry. The Guardian publicised the name of Skrabanek as “paid stooge”. Professor McCormick said: \\"I have never had a cheque from Philip Morris ... Petr may have done. I don't know if he did. We both knew there were people in the tobacco industry and elsewhere who thought our views were less inimical to their products than others.\\" Robin Fox, editor of the Lancet from 1990-1995, said the journal was unaware that he was a consultant to a tobacco company. This hearsay received further coverage by New Scientist and in the BMJ. The Irish Medical Times wrote, \\"His several hundred publications demonstrated his breadth of scholarship and ability to communicate with learned and popular publications in a number of languages... As a teacher Professor Skrabanek is irreplaceable.\\" Regarding Skrabanek's work, the British Medical Journal stated \\"With the spirit of European iconoclasm he kept the medical evangelists in their hot boxes... He was a good scientist, as his work on substance P testifies, but this was not to be his métier. Rather he chose to take the broader intellectual view of a profession in disarray, a profession in need of careful watching.\\" \\"James McCormick and Prof Petr Skrabanek were internationally known as the bête-noires of establishment medicine; their book Follies and Fallacies in Medicine is one I find myself returning to again and again.\\" said Muiris Houston, consultant in Medical Education at The Galway Clinic and award-winning medical journalist and health analyst with The Irish Times. At the time of his death The Times explained, \\"From his base at Trinity College, Dublin a stream of scientific papers and articles exposed the claims of public health doctors, epidemiologists, dietary evangelists and others that many diseases were preventable.\\" In 2005, the president of the Dutch anti-quackery organisation Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij, Cees Renkens, wrote that Skrabanek was one of the first to warn for the dangers of 'randomised clinical trials of absurd claims' and pleaded for the 'demarcation of the absurd'.

The Greek Constitution of 1844The box the Constitution of 1844 was kept in. The first constitution of the Kingdom of Greece was the Greek Constitution of 1844. On 3 September 1843, the military garrison of Athens, with the help of citizens, rebelled and demanded from King Otto the concession of a Constitution. The Constitution that was proclaimed in March 1844 came from the workings of the \\"Third of September National Assembly of the Hellenes in Athens\\" and was a Constitutional Pact, in other words a contract between the monarch and the Nation. This Constitution re-established the Constitutional Monarchy and was based on the French Constitution of 1830 and the Belgian Constitution of 1831. Its main provisions were the following: It established the principle of monarchical sovereignty, as the monarch was the decisive power of the State; the legislative power was to be exercised by the King - who also had the right to ratify the laws - by the Parliament, and by the Senate. The members of the Parliament could be no less than 80 and they were elected for a three-year term by universal suffrage. The senators were appointed for life by the King and their number was set at 27, although that number could increase should the need arise and per the monarch's will, but it could not exceed half the number of the members of Parliament. The ministers' responsibility for the King's actions is established, who also appoints and removes them. Justice stems from the King and is dispensed in his name by the judges he himself appoints. Lastly, this Assembly voted the electoral law of 18 March 1844, which was the first European law to provide, in essence, for universal suffrage (but only for men).https://www.britannica.com/place/Greece/Building-the- nation-1832-1913#ref297975 Despite the fact that Otto accepted the establishment of a Constitutional regime, he was not inclined to enforce it and by breaking both the spirit and the letter of the Constitution he tried to gather as much power as he possibly could.

He was a student of Erhard Schmidt and Adolf Hammerstein, and received his doctorate from the University of Berlin in 1933. However, as a Jew, he had to leave Germany shortly afterwards to avoid Nazi persecution. After a short period in Zagreb in the former Yugoslavia, Michael Golomb arrived in the U.S. in 1939, when he turned to applied mathematics. He was one of the first mathematicians to apply normed vector spaces in numerical analysis. He taught mathematics at Purdue University from 1942 until his retirement in 1975, at times holding joint appointment with the Schools of Engineering. He continued to teach as Professor Emeritus. In 1998 in Berlin, Michael Golomb was honored as part of a special exhibition entitled \\"Terror and Exile: Persecuted and expelled Berlin mathematicians in the time of the Nazi regime.\\" The exhibition was organized by the city of Berlin to coincide with the International Congress of Mathematicians there.

He is a multiple Grammy Award nominee, and the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and a MacArthur Fellowship. Zenón has released many albums as a band leader and appeared on over 70 recordings as a sideman. Early life Born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Zenón was raised in Residencial Luis Llorens Torres, the largest housing project in the Island. Although he didn't grow up in a family of musicians, he was nevertheless exposed to various styles of music from a very early age. At age 10 he received his first lessons on music theory and solfeggio from Ernesto Vigoreaux, an elderly gentleman who traveled from the adjacent neighborhood of Villa Palmeras to Llorens Torres every day in order to work with disadvantaged youth in the community. Zenón would eventually be admitted to Escuela Libre de Música, a performing arts middle school and high school where he was trained for six years on classical saxophone by Angel Marrero. On the 11th grade he was exposed to jazz music by some of his friends at the school and became very interested in the concept of improvisation and on the music of jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker. Although he had always shown interest in the natural sciences, he declined an engineering scholarship from the Recinto Universitario de Mayagüez (the foremost engineering institution in the Island) and decided to pursue a career in music. After a year and a half worth of efforts to gather enough funds in scholarships and financial aid, Zenón moved to Boston in the spring of 1996 to begin his studies at Berklee College of Music.  Education and session work  At Berklee, Zenón's classmates included Antonio Sánchez, Anat Cohen, Avishai Cohen, Jaleel Shaw, and Jeremy Pelt. During his time in Boston, he was heavily influenced by Bill Pierce, Ed Tomassi, and Hal Crook. It was also during this time that he met Panamanian pianist Danilo Pérez, who would become a mentor and collaborator. After graduating from Berklee in 1996, Zenón attended Manhattan School of Music, where he studied with Dick Oatts, Nils Vigeland and Ludmila Ulehla and received a master's degree in Performance in 2001 before settling in New York City. As a sideman, he has worked with SFJAZZ Collective, Charlie Haden, Fred Hersch, Kenny Werner, Guillermo Klein & Los Guachos, David Sánchez, Danilo Pérez, The Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, Kurt Elling, The Mingus Big Band, Ray Barreto, Jerry González & The Fort Apache Band, Jeff Ballard Trio, Miles Okazaki, Dan Weiss, Dan Tepfer, Bobby Hutcherson, Steve Coleman, Andy Montañez, Brian Lynch, Antonio Sánchez, Paoli Mejías, David Gilmore, and Jason Lindner.  As leader   The Miguel Zenón Quartet  In 1999 Zenón started getting together with Mexican drummer Antonio Sánchez (who he met at Berklee College of Music), Austrian bassist Hans Glawischnig (Zenón's bandmate in the David Sanchez Group) and Venezuelan pianist Luis Perdomo (a classmate of Glawischnig's at The Manhattan School of Music). They would meet for informal rehearsal sessions at Glawischnig's apartment in New York's Upper West Side and play through some of Zenón's early compositions. The group, which would eventually become the Miguel Zenón Quartet, soon started performing at various venues in the city, such as the C Note and The Jazz Gallery. In 2005 Sanchez began working regularly with The Pat Metheny Group, and was replaced in the Quartet by Puerto Rican drummer Henry Cole, for what has become the longest running version of the ensemble.  Recordings as leader  * Looking Forward – Fresh Sound New Talent (2002): Recommended by some of his peers, Miguel Zenón reached a deal with the Spanish record label Fresh Sound New Talent, which released his first album as a leader. The recording featured his working Quartet (with Perdomo, Glawischnig and Sanchez) and included many special guests, such as saxophonist David Sanchez, guitarist Ben Monder and percussionist Pernell Saturnino. The album was selected by the New York Times as the top \\"Alternative\\" jazz recording of 2002. * Ceremonial – Marsalis Music (2004): After Zenón's first release, he was approached by saxophonist Branford Marsalis (whom Zenón had met while working with David Sanchez) to join his newly formed record label Marsalis Music. Zenón was signed to a multi-record deal and released his second album as a leader with the label. The album featured the Quartet performing his original compositions plus an arrangement of the Gospel Hymn \\"Great is Thy Faithfulness\\". Ceremonial was described by All About Jazz as a \\"recording (that) brings not only Latin persuasions but also a refined mix of contemporary, classic, and global influences… Highly recommended\\". * Jíbaro – Marsalis Music (2005): His third recording as a leader featured original compositions inspired by elements coming from la La Música Jibara, a style of folk music from the rural areas of Puerto Rico. About Jíbaro, Jazz Times Magazine wrote: \\"A searing modern-jazz sound, a quartet sensibility that Zenon and his mates have spent years developing. The result is profound yet joyful, as rhythmically precise as it is lyrical and limber.\\" * Awake – Marsalis Music (2008): Zenón's fourth release, and the first to incorporate Henry Cole on the drum chair, incorporates a string quartet and additional horns to Zenón's core group for and outing of original compositions. * Esta Plena – Marsalis Music (2009): His fifth album was inspired by Plena music from Puerto Rico, with original compositions supported by a fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation. On it Zenón augmented his quartet to include three percussionist/vocalists and took on the additional roles of both lyricist and vocalist. Esta Plena received two Grammy nominations (Best Improvised Solo and Best Latin Jazz Album) and a Latin Grammy nomination for Best Latin Jazz Album. * Alma Adentro – Marsalis Music (2011): A tribute to the Puerto Rican Songbook on which Zenón arranged the music of five Puerto Rican composers: Bobby Capo, Tite Curet Alonso, Pedro Flores, Rafael Hernandez and Sylvia Rexach. The recording features his Quartet plus a ten-piece woodwind ensemble orchestrated and conducted by Guillermo Klein. Alma Adentro was chosen as the Best Jazz Recording of 2011 by iTunes and NPR, and received a Grammy nomination for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album plus a Latin Grammy nomination for Best Instrumental Album. * Rayuela – Sunnyside Records (2012): A collaboration with French pianist/composer Laurent Coq, this album was inspired on the book of the same name by Argentinean writer Julio Cortazar. The recording also features Dana Leong (on cello and trombone) and Dan Weiss (on tabla, drums and percussion). * Oye!!! Live in Puerto Rico – Miel Music (2013): Zenón's eight recording as a leader (and first for his independent label Miel Music) features the debut recording of The Rhythm Collective, an ensemble first put together in 2003 for a month long tour of West Africa. The \\"all Puerto Rican\\" group includes Aldemar Valentín on electric bass, Tony Escapa on drums and Reinaldo de Jesus on percussion. * Identities Are Changeable – Miel Music (2014): Inspired by the idea of national identity as experienced by the Puerto Rican community in the United States, specifically in the New York City area.

The foundation is devoted to \\"overcoming the intolerance of transvestitism and transsexualism brought about by widespread ignorance.\\" Founder Merissa Sherrill Lynn states, \\"The crossdressing and transsexual phenomena have been an integral part of human experience as long as there has been a human experience. These phenomena have manifested themselves in every society and in every walk of life throughout history, and continue to affect the lives of vast numbers of people. Yet, as common as they are, ignorance of them, and the resulting intolerance and fear, continues to cost good people their happiness, their jobs, their families, and their lives. It costs society its neighbors, its friends, and its productive citizens.\\" History The International Foundation for Gender Education (IFGE) was first known as the Tiffany Club in 1978. It eventually became the IFGE when founded by Merissa Sherrill Lynn in 1986. Lynn held the organization’s first convention in 1977. As of 1996, IFGE was one of three national transgender organizations in the United States to have an actual office, and the only transgender organization in the country to have paid staff. In 1998, the organization almost closed its doors due to financial difficulties. Eventually, the organization would experience major difficulties in the late 2000s which have resulted in the presumed closure of the organization. Disagreement within management and improper restructuring appear to be the causes of said issues. This information comes from the blog of the former editor Dallas Denny. As if the early 2010s, IFGE's website is inactive, but still live today.  Functions  According to former editor Dallas Denny, IFGE provided the following services: # Annual conferences which allowed transgender individuals to commune and network to build community in-person. # Transgender Tapestry # A phone line and physical center were located in Massachusetts. # A bookstore which provided materials for the community. # The Winslow Street Fund created by Joni Chrissman  Notable Persons   Dallas Denny  Denny was editor for Transgender Tapestry, later leaving the organization to write for Chrysalis Quarterly.  Merissa Sherrill Lynn  Lynn is the founder of IFGE. She was born in 1942 in New Hampshire and grew up there, later receiving her BA in Philosophy from her state's university in 1971 after military service in the early 60s. IFGE was conceived when she opened her home to the transgender and cross dressing community. She also originated the organization's major publication. Her networking allowed for global education on gender variance. Merissa Sherrill Lynn stepped down from director of the organization after a stroke in 1998. She passed away in 2017. Major Publications Transgender Tapestry Transgender Tapestry \\"is a magazine by, for, and about all things trans, including crossdressing, transsexualism, intersexuality, FTM, MTF, butch, femme, drag kings and drag queens, androgyny, female and male impersonation, and more.\\" It ran from 1979-2008, and offered up-to-date media on LGBTQ+ pop culture, specializing in transgender media. Transgender tapestry began as a newsletter called The TV-TS Tapestry by the Tiffany Club. After multiple name and publisher changes was finally called Transgender Tapestry. Web site IFGE has offered a Web site containing information for transgender people since 1998. The site was very heavily used by transgender people seeking information on the Internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with respondents to a 2002 survey identifying the site as the \\"best source on the internet,\\" preferring the site to Google and Yahoo for trans-related information seeking.

Test panels (sometimes called profiles) are typically composed of individual laboratory tests which are related in some way: by the medical condition they are intended to help diagnose (cardiac risk panel), by the specimen type (complete blood count, CBC), by the tests most frequently requested by users (comprehensive chemistry profile), by the methodology employed in the test (viral panel by polymerase chain reaction), or by the types of components included (urine drug screen). Advantages of diagnostic test panels over individual diagnostic tests Test panels offer various advantages to laboratories performing the tests (labor efficiency, potential for automation and reduced costs through performing large numbers of the same kinds of tests each day) as well as to end users such as ordering physicians and hospitals (more comprehensive testing, rapid turn-around, and lower prices). The presence of several tests responsive to the same clinical condition may also increase the chances of detecting that condition. Disadvantages of test panels Among the disadvantages of test panels are the inclusion of diagnostically sub-optimal tests based upon commercial availability of test reagents, cost considerations, or compatibility with the testing instruments and methods. Another disadvantage is the fact that approximately 5% of the test results can be expected to fall outside the normal (bell curve) range for purely statistical reasons. Thus, there is an expectation that the number of abnormal appearing results will increase with the number of tests in the panel (for quantitative tests such as blood glucose and total protein). For a typical twenty-test panel, there will be, on average, one or more of these apparent abnormal results. The proportion of such apparently abnormal results may be even higher if the normal ranges printed on the report do not accurately reflect the species, gender or age of the patient. It is common for normal ranges for bodily fluid constituents to differ from the general population for very young or old patients, and in some cases (such as hormones) for males versus females. Differences in those parameters between species are more the rule than the exception. The statistical considerations typically do not apply for qualitative (present or absent) tests, such as drug screens, unless the substance being tested for (e.g. drug) is actually present at a concentration near the cutoff concentration.

Vail, David G. Sanchez and Noemi Dominguez, one Middle School: W.B. Green Jr. High, and one High School: La Feria High School. LFISD is ranked as a 4A school district. Its mascot is the Lion, the school colors are maroon and gold, and the district's motto is Expect, Achieve, Excel. In 2009, the school district was rated \\"academically acceptable\\" by the Texas Education Agency. La Feria High School La Feria High School is classified as an AAAA (4A) campus, as regulated by Texas U.I.L. regulations. Athletics include: Football, Basketball (Boys and Girls), Cross Country (Boys and Girls), Volleyball, Tennis (Boys and Girls), Soccer (Boys and Girls), Track and Field (Boys and Girls), Baseball, and Softball. During the 2008-2009 Football season, Rio Grande Valley History was made, as the La Feria Lions recorded the valley's first ever post-season football win at the Alamodome, defeating the heavily favored Bandera Bulldogs 31-14. W.B. Green Junior High School Another \\"Academically Excellent\\" campus. Grades 7 and 8. Elementary schools Sam Houston Elementary is the Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten campus, David G. Sanchez Elementary is our newest campus, and is home to 1st and 2nd grade C.E. Vail houses 3-4 graded, Noemi Dominguez house 5th and 6th Naming controversy When Noemi Dominguez Elementary School was under construction, the school board asked the residents of the city to generate a list of names for the new school. Forms were provided in the local newspaper, and residents wrote their choices and delivered it to the main office. A large majority of the vote was in favor of naming the school after retired principal and teacher, Mrs. Ruth Johnson or principal Carlos Verduzco. However, the school board chose a name that was not proposed by any significant percentage of the respondents. They named it after Noemi Dominguez, a 1991 graduate of La Feria High School who obtained her BA from Rice University and was a teacher in the Houston ISD pursuing a master's degree in education from the University of Houston before her life was cut short by %C3%81ngel Maturino Res%C3%A9ndiz. The school board's decision to name the new elementary school after Dominguez was a tribute to the short life of a local Mexican American woman. The school board's decision was reached because of the board's desire to name the school after a respected Mexican American community member. Indeed, Dominguez Elementary School was the first local school to be named after a Mexican American. This was significant given the local history of Mexican segregation. La Feria ISD: Dynamic Era of Educational Change The 1960s brought tremendous changes and disturbances to the American educational system. Although the decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 mandated an end to segregation, La Feria Consolidated Independent School District (LFCISD) and many other school districts throughout the United States failed to comply with desegregation mandates. In the 1960s La Feria had five schools: La Feria High School; Lincoln Junior High, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Robert E. Lee, and Sam Houston. Sam Houston Elementary School (1-4) was also known as the Mexican School. It was a segregated school for Mexican and Mexican American students. In rare instances, Mexican American students were admitted to Robert E. Lee Elementary School upon the insistence of parents and the approval of school administration. In addition to the white school campus located at Robert E. Lee Elementary, Robert E. Lee housed 4th and 5th grade Mexican and Mexican American students at the original, two story High School [old] building. Corporal punishment was the discipline of choice and administered on a daily basis to Mexican and Mexican American students who spoke Spanish at the Robert E. Lee campus. ~~Eyewitness Contributor attended LFCISD 1-12;~~ La Feria administration pictures, documents and records; newspaper; private pictures; student testimony; teacher(s) and classmate(s) historical accounts; early edition yearbooks. It was an administrative decision that determined whether or not 3rd grade students attending Sam Houston would be promoted to Robert E. Lee [i.e., the Anglo campus] after the completion of the third grade, or remain at Sam Houston Elementary for the completion of the fourth grade. Though attending the same school at Robert E. Lee, separate classrooms divided Anglo students from Mexican and Mexican American students. This did not change at Roosevelt school which was a 5th and 6th grade campus. The segregation continued through Lincoln Junior High. By the 1970s, the High School was not segregated. There were some Mexican American students who were exceptions to this rule of racial segregation and were placed in predominantly Anglo classrooms. These students were often children who had a strong command of the English language, and whose parents were educated and of middle class social economic status. Such parents did not want their children attending school with Mexicans and/or Spanish speaking Mexican American children. This basically constituted a type of class discrimination among Mexican Americans. ~~Life experiences as a student at La Feria ISD.~~ \\"Psychology of Social Class\\" and other professional readings in Classism, pride & prejudice, class association & dis-association; in-class racism. In 1971, the Mexican American seniors had their own club and no Anglos were allowed. This was their form of segregation. Also, in the 1960s, the student population at La Feria hit a record high. Enrollment increased at Sam Houston Elementary school. The district began a summer language program for Spanish-speaking children. After the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 passed, more opportunities opened for minorities. Title I allowed the hiring of teacher aids and provided funds to employ more teachers, which La Feria did. In 1967 the Head Start Program opened its doors at Sam Houston Elementary. Because of these external and internal forces the La Feria ISD administration, led by Mr. C. E. Vail until 1974 and then by Mr. William B. Green, began implementing the state mandated programs to show La Feria could comply and that its schools could excel. It was a slow gradual process, but Mexican American students and staff became more involved and visible in the school community. Circa 1962, La Feria already had a Mexican American female teacher at Sam Houston. In 1971 the first Mexican American school board member was elected. When Sam Houston desegregated in 1972, another Mexican American joined the school board. Also, in 1972 La Feria hired the first Mexican American counselor. By 1974 Mexican Americans were visible at all levels of La Feria school system. There were two principals, one at Sam Houston Elementary and one at La Feria High School, one counselor and six teachers at the high school and various teachers at the elementary and middle school level.Figures were obtained by studying the 1968-1975 La Feria High School yearbooks.

In 1870, Charles Stanfield established the Truro Woollen Mills on Brunswick Street, Truro, opposite the Intercolonial Railway station. He also built the St. Croix Woollen Mills in St. Croix and the Union Woollen Mills in Farnham, Quebec. The Truro Felt Works were later established east of the woollen mills and Stanfield finally established the current textile mill on the south bank of the Salmon River in the town in 1882.Stanfield's Official Website, About Us Period of innovation In 1896, Charles Stanfield sold his business interests to his two sons, John and Frank.

VI c. 68) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which allowed the government to designate areas as new towns, and passing development control functions to a Development Corporation. Several new towns were created in the years following its passing. The Act was replaced by the New Towns Act 1965 and, later, the New Towns Act 1981. Background information The 1944 Abercrombie Plan for London proposed eight new towns within of London for up to 500,000 people from inner London. Similar recommendations were made for other major conurbations including Manchester and Birmingham. The 1945 Attlee Government set up a New Towns Commission to formally consider how best to repair and rebuild urban communities ravaged in World War II. In 1945 John Reith, 1st Baron Reith was appointed as chair of the New Towns Commission. The commission concluded that there was a need to construct new towns using the instrument of development corporations supported by central government. The New Towns Act 1946 cemented this vision in 1946 and New Towns were born. The 1946 Act was extensively revised in 1965 and 1981.\\"New Towns Act 1981 (c. 64)\\" Reith Commission The Reith Commission recommended that: *the new town developments should have a population of up to 60,000 *they should be built as far as possible on greenfield sites *there should be predominantly single family housing at low density *the homes had to be organised in neighbourhoods around a primary school and nursery schools, a pub and shops selling staple foods *there should be a balance of housing and jobs Process The act set up New Town Development Corporations which were responsible for the management, design and development of New Towns. These were Public Corporations financed by the Government through Treasury loans. The boards were appointed by Central Government; importantly, they were given planning and compulsory purchase order powers. Their first task was to draw up development frameworks for a mix of housing, offices, industrial development, transport infrastructure and open space. New Towns were developed in three generations. *The first generation set up in the late 1940s concentrated predominantly on housing development on greenbelt sites with little provision for cars; eight were in a ring around London. *The second generation in the early 1960s included a wider mix of uses and used more innovative architecture. *The third generation towns were larger; they included Milton Keynes, designated in 1965 and Central Lancashire, the last, which was designated in 1970. These later new towns tended to be designed around car travel.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. Production The design was built by Alsberg Brothers Boatworks in Santa Cruz, California, United States. The company completed 117 examples between 1982 and 1988 when the factory closed. The boat was the first design offered when the company was formed and was the basis for the entire line of sailboats that it built. Design Express 27 The Express 27 is an ultralight displacement recreational keelboat, built predominantly of vacuum-bagged vinylester, S-glass, E-glass, Klegecell foam and a balsa core, with wood trim. It has a fractional sloop or optional masthead sloop rig, a raked stem, a reverse transom, an internally mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a tiller and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of ballast. Later versions had a stepped transom to make boarding easier. The boat was actually designed around the cockpit jib winches. Designer Schumacher describes the concept in a 1985 interview in Latitude 38, working with builder Terry Alsberg on the design, \\"Terry and I started off with the idea of building a boat the same weight as a Moore 24, but two feet longer, but we eventually decided on the largest possible boat that could use a single speed (Barient 10) winch for the jib, which turned out to be 27 feet.\\" The hull design has a sharp bow, but also a forward flared shape, to prevent digging in while sailing downwind. The hull's V-shape is designed for planing. The large rudder increases stability while sailing on the plane. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted and is normally fitted with a small well-mounted outboard motor for docking and maneuvering. Below decks there is no galley, just seats, a bow \\"V\\"-berth and two quarter berths aft, with a teak and holy cabin sole. The head is a portable type, located forward, \\"V\\"-berth. Ventilation is provided by a forward hatch, while the small cabin ports are fixed. The cockpit has two single speed jib winches. There is a standard 12:1 boom vang, 16:1 adjustable backstay and 2:1 mainsheet traveler, plus a 4:1 mainsheet block. The design has a PHRF racing average handicap of 129 to 130. Practical Sailor magazine noted, \\"A hefty ballast/displacement ratio nearing 50%, a painstakingly lowered center of gravity, a judiciously sharp entry, and augmented form stability are among the things that helped Schumacher create a boat that sails well to windward. So, too, do her narrow footprint, reduced windage, easily-controlled sailplan, and modified V-sections aft (which aid sail-carrying without measurably increasing drag.) Those sections (inspired in part, Schumacher said, by Aussie 18 skiffs) also help the boat plane quickly and controllably.\\" Operational history Express 27 By 2003 there were one- design fleets racing the Express 27 on San Francisco Bay, Detroit, and in Oregon. The boats were also being handicap raced in 12 additional US states and two Canadian provinces. An owner of one the boats stated, \\"It's hard to top the value. You can have great sailing for a season, plus a trailer and all the costs of campaigning, for what most guys in boats this size spend on a new spinnaker.\\" Other owners said, \\"Hardly ever use motor.\\" \\"Great sitting headroom.\\" \\"After a dozen seasons of hard campaigning there's not a stress crack anywhere.\\" \\"The rock stars say these boats are competitive no matter how old they are.\\" Practical Sailor wrote in a review in 2003, \\"The E-27 was ahead of her time. Many modern boats are built like her, and the heretical \\"light makes right\\" credo has become much closer to orthodoxy than it was in days of old. But take a look around at the one-designs that have come and gone since Alsberg sold his first 27-footer in 1982. Why have these 117 E-27s seen them come and seen them go? Materials and workmanship, certainly, but there's also the fact that Carl Schumacher didn't design spartan, crew-punishing boats, even if they were meant to be round-the-buoys or offshore one-design racers. He made accommodations that were actually sensible and comfortable, even in small boats, while never forgetting weight concerns.\\" See also Express 27 *List of sailing boat types Related development *Express 34 *Express 37 Similar sailboats *Aloha 27 *C&C; 27 *C&C; SR 27 *Cal 27 *Cal 2-27 *Cal 3-27 *Catalina 27 *Catalina 270 *Catalina 275 Sport *Crown 28 *CS 27 *Edel 820 *Fantasia 27 *Halman Horizon *Hotfoot 27 *Hullmaster 27 *Hunter 27 *Hunter 27-2 *Hunter 27-3 *Irwin 27 *Mirage 27 (Perry) *Mirage 27 (Schmidt) *O'Day 272 *Orion 27-2 *Tanzer 27 *Watkins 27 *Watkins 27P References External links * Category:Keelboats Category:1980s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts Category:Trailer sailers ","title":"Express 27"},{"id":"6895151","text":"Armstrong Frederick \\"Klondike\\" Smith (January 4, 1887 – November 15, 1959) was a Major League Baseball outfielder.

As a triple amputee, he has become a motivational speaker, mentor to young amputees, and amputee activist. He is also an actor. He has been characterized as the \\"quintessential California teenager\\" for \\"his blond hair, buff torso, and megawatt smile\\" albeit \\"on a pair of shiny, state-of-the-art robotic legs.\\" Amputation Accident and recovery On September 15, 2001, at the age of 15, Clapp was hit by a train. He had been drinking at a ceremony commemorating victims of the September 11 attacks and was unable to remember passing out on a railroad track near his home in Atascadero, California. His blood alcohol content was found to be .229. He was hit by a freight train travelling at high speed. His injuries required the amputation of both his legs above his knees and his right arm slightly below his shoulder. Clapp underwent extensive rehabilitation at the Hanger Clinic. He mastered independent walking only five months after the accident, an exceptional accomplishment. He is quoted as saying, \\"I left the wheelchair five months after the accident and I don’t want to have to use it again.\\" Prosthetics Clapp has used a series of increasingly advanced prosthetic limbs. He has three different sets of specialized prosthetic legs: one for walking, one for running, and one for swimming. Amputee activism Clapp has become a mentor and inspiration for amputees. He is a certified peer visitor with the Amputee Coalition of America. He advocates breakthrough technologies as a means of shattering the barriers between the disabled and the mainstream. Clapp has devoted hundreds of hours in counseling young amputees as to the endless possibilities of attaining mainstream functionality after life-altering loss of limbs. As part of this effort, he attends Camp No Limits in Maine, and mentors amputees such as Charlotte Cleverley-Bisman. His amputee activism has included extensive visitation and counseling of returning veterans of the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan who have sustained the loss of limbs. This includes multiple appearances at Walter Reed Army Medical Center's \\"Warriors in Transition\\" program. In November 2005 he was honored with a Shining Star award at the 58th annual Shining Star Awards Gala, an honor previously bestowed upon Christopher Reeve and Ray Charles. Sponsored by Just One Break Inc. (JOB), a national nonprofit organization founded in part by Eleanor Roosevelt in 1947 to promote the employment of disabled World War II service veterans, the award \\"recognize[s] individuals and organizations whose achievements and/or support further the potential of people with disabilities, either by example or by supporting JOB in its mission of helping qualified applicants obtain sustainable employment.\\" Athletics Before the accident Clapp had been an active athlete. He has since participated in numerous athletic competitions for amputees. He competed in the University of Central Oklahoma's Endeavor Games from 2002 to 2005. Cameron's gold and silver medal accomplishments include running 100 meters in only 18 seconds and swimming 20 laps. He aspires to compete in the Paralympic Games, although he jokes that \\"there aren't enough athletes in my category. I'm the only triple amputee that runs!\\" He is additionally an accomplished golfer. Acting career Clapp's acting career has spanned television and film. In 2005 his accident and miraculous recovery was featured on the Discovery Channel series Medical Incredible. His television roles have included Jake, the no-legged boyfriend in NBC's My Name Is Earl. He also appeared in HBO's Carnivàle as the character of Management. He portrayed a wounded service member in the 2008 feature film Stop-Loss. He also played the role of \\"The Total Package\\" in Comedy Central's Workaholics.

Cala Foods was the sister chain to Bell Markets. The last Cala Foods store closed its doors on December 1, 2011. History Cala Foods was established in 1947 by the seven brothers of the Cala family. Cala Foods acquired the QFI supermarket chain in 1973. The company merged with Bell Markets in the mid-1970s. Bell Markets was founded in the 1940s when Dominick Bell and his two brothers opened a supermarket in San Francisco. Cala Food was the first supermarket chain in San Francisco to stay open 24 hours per day, and one of the first in the US to use checkout scanners. The Cala Foods chain was purchased by the Yucaipa Companies in 1988. In 1994, Cala became a division of the Ralphs Grocery Company when Ralphs merged with Yucaipa. In August 2006, Ralphs reached an agreement to sell 11 of 13 Cala and Bell stores back to Harley DeLano, previous manager of the chain. While DeLano retains the right to use the Cala and Bell store names, Kroger retains ownership of the names themselves. In January 2007, DeLano Retail Partners took control of all but one Cala Foods Store and immediately rebranded the stores to DeLano's IGA. In late 2010, it was announced that Delano's was struggling financially and that the majority of DeLano's IGA locations would be closing. The store at the intersection of California and Hyde streets on San Francisco's Nob Hill was operated by Kroger and represented the last Cala Foods Store until its closure on December 1, 2011. It was originally slated to close at the end of 2010, but remained open one additional year. Following concerns that the distinctive building would be torn down, Trader Joe's instead opened a branch within it in 2012.

As such, they can be broadly considered to be trace fossils. The most well-known types of bromalites are fossilised faeces or coprolites. However, other types are recognised, including: regurgitalites (fossilised remains of vomit or other regurgitated objects such as owl pellets); cololites (intestinal contents); and gastrolites (stomach contents). Regurtitalites and coprolites are thus essentially known only after they have left the body of the producing organisms, whereas gastrolites and cololites are only found in situ in their respective organs. Whilst coprolites and regurgitalites are often difficult to tie to a specific producer, all bromalites potentially provide important and sometimes unique evidence concerning diet and other trophic factors.

Early life and career George MacLeay Macarthur-Onslow was born 2 May 1875 in the town of Camden, New South Wales. He was the great grandson of John Macarthur and Elizabeth Macarthur. When his father Arthur Onslow died in 1882, his mother Elizabeth changed her name to Macarthur-Onslow and took George and his five siblings to England in 1887. In England George was educated at Rugby School. There his mother studied dairy farming, and on returning to Camden in 1889 she founded a dairy farming complex, the Camden Vale Milk Co, which eventually merged with the Dairy Farmers' Co-operative Milk Co in 1928. On 5 April 1895 he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the New South Wales Mounted Rifles and was promoted to lieutenant the next year. In July 1903 he became a lieutenant in the 2nd Light Horse Regiment. He was promoted to captain in 1911 and major on 16 February 1914, commanding the 9th Light Horse Regiment. First World War In August 1914, Macarthur-Onslow was given command of the 1st Light Horse Regiment, part of the Australian Imperial Force. While organising the regiment, he had to relinquish command and undergo an operation for appendicitis. On 1 November 1914, he was again appointed to the AIF, this time as second in command of the 7th Light Horse Regiment. The 7th Light Horse Regiment arrived in Egypt in February 1915 where it trained at Maadi. In May, it received orders to move to Gallipoli for dismounted service, arriving on 19 May. Macarthur-Onslow took over command of the 7th Light Horse in October and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 22 November. On 17 December he organised the famous cricket match at Shell Green. At Katia on 5 August 1916, the 7th Light Horse, advancing in a single line, came under fire from a party of Turks some 200 metres in front of them. The Turks were rushed and overwhelmed. Macarthur-Onslow then advanced from the position with three men, 20 metres in front of his troopers; all four were hit by Turks concealed in front of them. Severely wounded, Macarthur- Onslow was evacuated. He was mentioned in despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). Macarthur-Onslow returned to the regiment in time to take part in the Battle of Beersheba, leading the 7th on a night march around Gaza. When the order to retire was received, he concentrated the regiment, and returned that way, having ridden around the town. He later led his regiment through the battles for Gaza, the pursuit across the Philistine Plain, and the operations across the Jordan. From May to August 1918, Macarthur-Onslow was acting commander of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade in the absence of the Brigadier General Granville Ryrie. On 3 September 1918, he took command of the newly formed 5th Light Horse Brigade, with the temporary rank of brigadier general. In January 1919, Macarthur-Onslow was evacuated with typhoid and returned to Australia four months later. For his services in Palestine, he was twice more mentioned in despatches, and appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG). Later life After the war, Macarthur-Onslow was elected councillor for Wollondilly Shire, alderman of Camden City Council and mayor of Camden. Like his brother James Macarthur-Onslow, he was aide de camp to the Governor General from 1920 to 1923. He commanded the 1st Cavalry Division from 1927 to 1931. He died on 12 September 1931 and was buried in the family cemetery on the Camden Park Estate.

Merry A PARIS } Taskin inherited Blanchet's title of royal harpsichord maker (facteur des clavessins du Roi) and additionally became keeper of the King’s instruments alongside Christophe Chiquelier in 1770, though he only fully occupied that role when Chiquelier retired in 1774. In order to carry out both of his duties as both a maker and keeper of musical instruments, he set up a workshop in Versailles in 1777 and hired his nephew, Pascal-Joseph Taskin II (1750–1829), to work there; his other nephews Henry Taskin and Lambert Taskin also worked for him, though little is known of them. Pascal Joseph II went on to work in the Blanchet workshop in 1763 and, like his uncle, married into the family in 1777 with his wedding to François Etienne Blanchet II's daughter. After his death in 1793, Pascal Taskin was succeeded by his stepson, Armand-François-Nicolas Blanchet, whom he had brought up himself. Harpsichords and pianos Pascal Taskin built on and refined the already excellent Blanchet harpsichord-making tradition. He is credited with introducing genouillères (knee-levers) with which to control the stop combinations, and a new register of jacks using peau de buffle (soft buff leather) plectra, instead of the usual quill, in 1768. He continued the common French practise, pursued successfully by Blanchet, of making ravalements of Ruckers and Couchet harpsichords, which involved rebuilding the 17th century Flemish instruments, which were highly valued for their sound quality, to suit the modern French tastes. Like other makers of the time, he resorted to selling 'Ruckers' harpsichords which had very few original parts, or none at all, such was the premium associated with the name by then; his last known instrument, a double dated 1788, has a rose signed \\"Andreas Ruckers\\" and a Flemish-style painted soundboard. Unlike other makers, his instruments were always of excellent quality, whether passed off as Ruckers or not. He began to build fortepianos with Blanchet in the 1760s, probably originally modelled after those of Gottfried Silbermann, with a Bartolomeo Cristofori-type action. None of his early pianos survives; the earliest date from the late 1780s and have a very simple action without escapement, which he devised in order to reduce friction. These instruments have luxuriant veneering of the Louis XVI style. Another instrument he made was the Armandine, a large psaltery with gut strings resembling a harpsichord without a keyboard, in 1790 for Anne-Aimée Armand (1774–1846); a surviving example is in the Musée de la Musique, Paris. Taskin's workshop became more occupied with piano production and the importing of English square pianos in the 1770s and 1780s, but not to the detriment of harpsichords; his death inventory of 1793 shows an equal number of each instrument under construction. There are seven of his double manual harpsichords still in existence; they are prime examples of the late French school of harpsichord building, with a warm and rich tone, range of FF–f, and disposition of 8' 8' 4' and buff stop. His 1769 double and the 1763/1783–1784 Goermans/Taskin (which Taskin tried to pass off as a Couchet by filing away the initials 'JG' to 'IC') have both been praised as ideal instruments for the late French baroque repertoire such as the works of Rameau and Armand-Louis Couperin. The Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments houses a 1770 double. These instruments have been studied and copied many times by modern makers.

During his childhood, he was part of a punk group before playing the piano in café-theatres. He released his first album in 1993; it gave him immediate name recognition. Fersen is an accomplished poet who regularly plays with language, using puns, rich rhymes, symbols and images taken from the realms of plants (vegetables and fruits) and animals (birds and various beasts) to tell stories or original fables, to recreate moments from daily life, impressions and sentiments, and also the dreams of ordinary people and their failings and faults. His deep and gravelly smoker's voice gives a particular tone to his songs, which belong to different musical styles depending on the album (rock, folk-rock or jazz and blues).

She lives in Frelinghuysen Township, New Jersey, with her husband, artist Bennett Bean. The Chopsticks-Fork Principle, a humorous but poignant memoir, recounts Bao Bean's experiences as a Chinese immigrant growing up in the United States. Bao Bean uses the story of her own immigrant experience to explain how to reconcile the expectations of families and society at large. She also explains how to raise a child in a respectful context while also choosing the “path less traveled.”  Early life and education  Bean was born Kwei-yee Bao in Guilin, China, on August 27, 1942, to parents Sandys and Dora Bao. Her father, Sandys Bao, represented the Republic of China at the International Sugar Council of the United Nations; and he also served as Vice President of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. Cathy Bao Bean has two sisters, Bette Bao Lord and Jean Bao (also known as Bao Sansan). Bette is author of the autobiographical book Eighth Moon: The True Story of a Young Girl's Life in Communist China which recounts part of their childhood. When Bao Bean's father was sent to New York for a temporary assignment in 1946, he insisted on his family accompanying him. Her mother, however, thought that only the eldest, eight- year-old Bette, would benefit from the trip. When four-year-old Cathy heard of the plans, she packed her doll suitcase and parked in front of the door until her mother relented. The baby of the family, Jean, was left behind in the care of relatives to spare her the ordeal of travel. When Mao’s “bamboo curtain” fell in 1949, the four Baos remained in the United States and the youngest finally joined them in 1962. Bao Bean's first taste of the American educational system was at Public School #8 in Brooklyn, New York. When Bao Bean started school she could speak no English. By 1949, when the Bao family moved to Elmwood Park, New Jersey, Bao Bean started \\"to think in English and forget in Chinese\\", as she notes in the memoir book The Chopsticks-Fork Principle: A Memoir and Manual. The family finally settled in Teaneck, New Jersey, where she graduated in 1960 from Teaneck High School.The Chopsticks- Fork Principle, A Memoir and Manual. Accessed February 26, 2008. Bean received her B.A. in 1964 from Jackson College of Tufts University and her M.A. in Philosophy from Claremont Graduate College, Claremont, California in 1969. Bean was also awarded a Kent Fellowship, from the Danforth Foundation, 1965–67 and 1971-72.  Career  Bean taught philosophy at Montclair State College, Upper Montclair, New Jersey and at East Stroudsburg University, Pennsylvania in the 1980s and early 1990s. From 1968 to 1971, she taught at Jersey City State College. More recently, she has led diversity workshops and spoken on a wide range of issues at colleges and universities throughout the United States. Following the publication of The Chopsticks-Fork Principle, Bao Bean was featured on The Point with Mindy Todd, NPR Cape Cod; The Smoki Bacon Show, Boston; Under the Radar with Ron Saxon NPR NJ & PA; Many Voices, Many Visions, 13WHAM-TV Rochester. She was also interviewed on CNN, WYPL radio, as well as on NBC, ABC and Fox television affiliates. Bao Bean is a member of the Board of Advisors of the Claremont Graduate University School of the Arts and Humanities; the Board of the New Jersey Council for the Humanities; and a member of The Star-Ledger Scholarship Committee. She is currently Chair of the Society for Values in Higher Education, where she served as president of the organization from 2009 to 2013. Bao Bean has been founding director of The Summer Workshop for Teachers in China since 2011. She is also a founding member of the Ridge and Valley Conservancy. Bao Bean is the business manager and accountant for her spouse, artist Bennett Bean. In addition, she teaches aerobics as a service to the Frelinghuysen Township Recreation Committee, New Jersey.

It first opened in 2003. History Prior to 2003 Mount Isa was serviced by two state secondary schools. Mount Isa State High School and Kalkadoon State High School had served the community well. Following community consultation it was determined that to continue to provide the best possible education to students in Mount Isa that it was timely to merge the two schools. At the same time it was decided to open a residential campus to provide opportunities to students from outlying communities who do not have a secondary school. Spinifex State College officially opened in 2003. It is a three-campus co-educational school, with a Junior, Senior and Residential (boarding) campus. Spinifex State College offers and educational program for years 7–12. The Campuses Junior Campus The Junior Campus provides education for students in years 7–9. The school is based on a ‘school within a school’ concept with a Deputy and Head of Department assigned to, and managing each year level. In addition to this there is also a Pathways Program that caters for students who are not achieving success in the mainstream program. Some of the pathway students attend at the junior campus, some attend a class at the senior campus and others attend a class based at Mount Isa Special School. The Junior campus is equipped with tennis courts and basketball courts. Senior Campus The Senior campus provides from years 10 to 12. Students select a course of study from a wide variety of offerings including Queensland Studies Authority subject, Authority Registered subjects and also TAFE courses. Spinifex College has a Special Education Unit at the junior campus and a Special Education Class at the senior campus. Residential Campus The Residential campus is the first state-run boarding facility in Queensland for students attending a state school. This campus has the capacity to board and provide educational support to 57 students. Industry Links Since opening in 2003 the College has worked closely with local industry partners. In 2004, in partnership with Xstrata, Mount Isa Mines a Bursary program was introduced for year 11 students. Selected students attend Xstrata one day a week in Year 11 and during school holidays. This is then progressed into a SAT once students have identified their area of preference. In 2007 a new “Skills for the Future” program was offered for Year 9 students to give them an opportunity to attend the Xstrata Skills Centre and experience trade skills. Close links with Mount Isa TAFE have enabled a number of TAFE courses to be embedded into the school timetable. Spinifex College is also a Queensland Minerals and Energy Academy hub school. The Queensland Minerals and Energy Academy (QMEA) provides students with clear pathways into one of the state’s largest, dynamic and economically important sectors Extra curricular activities Sporting In 2006, Spinifex State College sent away a Touch Football team, the Taipans, to Singapore to compete in the World All Schools Touch Football competition, an event which attracts hundreds of teams from schools around the world. The Taipans won the competition. The College has also developed several successful Rugby league, Cricket, Soccer, Australian Rules Football, Softball and Hockey teams. Spinifex State College hosts its own netball club, and in 2015 had seven teams participate in the local netball competition. There are two junior teams: Spinners and Sparklers, whose teams are composed of Spinifex students, and there are five senior teams: Socialites, Stingers, Scorchers, Sapphires, and Strikers. The senior teams are composed primarily of Spinifex teachers and past-Spinifex students. Friendly games across all sports are conducted against Good Shepard Catholic College and Cloncurry State High School. Rivalry between the three schools is increasingly competitive. Music Spinifex State College has a combined campus concert band. The students in this band range from intermediate to experienced levels. The band placed 2nd at the regional Eisteddfod in 2005, placed 3rd in 2006, and 3rd in 2007. In 2005, the band received a Silver Award for FanFare – a prestigious school band competition held throughout Queensland. The school also has a jazz band, that formed in 2005 and the following year took 4th place at the North-West Queensland regional Eisteddfod. The jazz band reformed at the beginning of 2007 to form the Mount Isa Stage Band, which continues to this day and is open to all the community members to join. Drama Spinifex State College has a strong arts program and is well known for its stage musicals which are produced every two years. In 2003 they performed the hit musical Back to the 80s. 2005 saw the school perform another hit musical, again a comedy, Smithy. The story of Smithy follows a troublesome youth who joins the school play, Romeo and Juliet, and tries his luck with the hottest girl around. The school musical was postponed until 2008, in order to accommodate for the new music teacher and the new drama teacher. The school musical for 2008 was called Disco Inferno, a 70's themed comedy. It premiered on the 18th and 19 July at the Mount Isa Civic Center. 2010 saw the production of the world famous musical \\"Grease\\", again performed at the Mount Isa Civic Center to a positive audience reception. The musical was postponed, this time for three years. In 2014, Spinifex State College performed the hit \\"High School Musical\\" at the Mount Isa Civic Center which was met with acclaim by audiences. In 2016, Spinifex performed “Popstars”, a jukebox musical based on the drama surrounding a talent contest. In 2018, they staged “Rock of Ages”, yet another jukebox musical but one with Hollywood and Broadway ties. This most recent musical was extremely popular, and students and staff alike are anxious to perform again soon.

Overview The Academy, later known as the North British Academy of Arts, Science, Literature, and Music, was located in the Claremount Buildings on the western side of Barras Bridge on the corner with Eldon Place in Newcastle upon Tyne, which is now opposite the County Council Offices. Its objectives were initially \\"for the advancement of art, the encouragement and advantages of its associates and members, and for the creation of local art patriotism and enthusiasm amongst cultured and influential classes of North Britain.\\"Dominion, 9 January 1909, page 11e. They soon evolved to encompass \\"the betterment of humanity by the advancement of art, literature, science, music, education, law, medicine, manufactures, commerce, agriculture, industries, and, engineering, to the end that the sum of human knowledge may be increased\\", with the Society organized into ten sections, each presided over by a distinguished specialist. It was founded in 1908, incorporated in 1913, and dissolved in 1924. William James Morgan (1850-1923) was the secretary throughout the life of the Academy. At various times, Henry John Brinsley Manners (1852-1925), the 8th Duke of Rutland, was its president.The Official Year-Book of the Scientific and Learned Societies of Great Britain and Ireland, Charles Griffin & Co.

Arthur Willey, accountant, of 50 North Parade, Whitley in Northamptonshire was appointed liquidator. A subsequent Extraordinary General Meeting of its shareholders confirmed these resolutions on 22 February 1924. Maisie Strobel was annotated as secretary of the Society.The London Gazette of 29 April 1927 [p2826a] advised the registration (Reg. No. 5683 R. N'bld.) of the North British Academy of Arts had been cancelled by the Registrar of Friendly Societies as it had ceased to exist. Early on the membership secretary was Frederick Huntley (1887-1960), and curator was William J. Macgarree. The \\"Entrance Fee\\" was two guineas, the \\"Annual Subscription\\", one guinea, and \\"Life Composition\\", twelve guineas. Annual Meetings were held in September, and exhibitions of members' works normally held twice a year.

A gardening competition was established in 1910 to foster a love of nature and beauty amongst school children, so that the homes of the poor might be beautified and the young provided with an innocent and interesting hobby. Initially there were 2,761 child gardeners at work in the slums of Newcastle upon Tyne, competing for prizes to a total of 50 guineas with the Academy providing the seeds. Their window boxes and flower pots were to be exhibited and judged in one of the school halls of the city in September of the following year. It was intended to extend the competition to London and other cities and towns of the United Kingdom, with school principals in North Britain being asked to encourage their charges to enter the competition.Children and Flower Culture in The Limerick Chronicle, 16 June 1910, page 2e.

Geography  Wilston is located approximately 3.4 kilometres from the Brisbane central business district, and is a mixture of old and new styles of architecture, from workers' cottages to modern architect-designed homes on Wilston Hill. Wilston is home to many professionals, including many medical professionals, due to its inner city location, proximity to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital and views of the city that are available from more elevated streets. In recent years, the area has been transformed by the revamping of Kedron Brook Road, an early precursor to the City Council’s urban renewal process that was to roll out across much of inner Brisbane. This has seen a vibrant hub of al-fresco dining evolve, which in turn has increased the popularity of the area and led to a significant increase in the cost of housing in recent years. Residents are also well serviced by public transport (Wilston train station and regular bus routes) and leisure parks and walkways running alongside Enoggera Creek. The area is also close to local sporting grounds such as Downey Park and Ballymore Stadium. History Aboriginal history The Turrbal clan occupied what is today known as Wilston. Urban development Wilston House, 2015 The area became known as Wilston after the home of the same name built there by the Honourable William Wilson MLC, who settled in the district in 1868. The home, which was constructed circa 1876, was named Wilston House after Wilson's birthplace home at Derrykeeghan Mills, Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Ireland. (The family believes it is short for Wilson Town) In 1884 the land passed to businessman John Stevenson MLA, who subdivided the property. Between 1924 and 1931 estates were created to provide more land for housing development. Notable residents James Tolson, a short-term resident of Wilston House, conducted important experiments in chilling mutton for export from Australia to Great Britain. Major General William Cahill, a commissioner of police in Queensland, also lived at Wilston House for a period. During his residence he further developed the grounds, which became known as a sanctuary for birds and native fauna. Peter Beattie, the former Premier of Queensland, previously resided in this suburb. Landmarks Oakleigh House, at 17 Murray Street, Wilston, has been a landmark for over fifty years. It was occupied, from 1902, by George Murray, a Brisbane police magistrate and postmaster. It is a colonial timber house which still stands proudly preserved today. 29 Murray Street (as a private home in 2011) In 1905, 29 Murray Street was built for the Zoeller family. The house became a reception centre in June 1948, and was the venue for over 25,000 wedding and other receptions until in 1990, 'Oakleigh' was also converted to a function venue, and both houses operated as such until 1995. Population In the Wilston had a population of 3,872 people.  Heritage listings  Heritage-listed sites in Wilston include: * 27 Clifton Street: Uanda, a house, listed on the Queensland Heritage Register * Primrose Street (now in Grange): Wilston State School, listed on the Queensland Heritage Register Schools Wilston State School is one of two schools in the area There are two schools in the area, Wilston State School in Primrose Street and St Columba's Primary in Kedron Brook Road. Sporting clubs Sporting clubs in the area include Wilston Norths Junior Cricket Club, Wilston Grange Australian Football Club, Fortitude Valley Rugby League Football Club and St Andrews Ladies Hockey Club. Other clubs include DAT Racing (triathlon), Wilston Crocs (swimming club), Lococo Tennis. The nearby Grange Club (Grange Bowls and Community Club Inc.) has represented the suburb in lawn bowls for 70 years. Retail business Wilston Village in Kedron Brook Road is the main retail area. Local stores in the area are supplemented by larger centres at HomeZone at Windsor, Lutwyche Shopping Centre and slightly further away at Stafford and Brookside. Transport Wilston railway station provides access to regular Queensland Rail City network services to Ferny Grove, Brisbane and Beenleigh. Demographics Oakleigh House, 2011 In the , the population of Wilston was 3,872, 50.1% female and 49.9% male. The median age of the Wilston population was 35 years, 2 years below the Australian median. 76% of people living in Wilston were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were England 4.5%, New Zealand 3.2%, Italy 1.3%, India 1.1%, South Africa 0.7%. 87.4% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 1.9% Italian, 0.6% German, 0.6% Cantonese, 0.6% Mandarin, 0.5% Punjabi.

Metabolism It is formed from L-histidine through the action of histidine ammonialyase (also known as histidase or histidinase) by elimination of ammonium. In the liver, urocanic acid is transformed by urocanate hydratase (or urocanase) to 4-imidazolone-5-propionic acid and subsequently to glutamic acid. Clinical significance Inherited deficiency of urocanase leads to elevated levels of urocanic acid in the urine, a condition known as urocanic aciduria. An important role for the onset of atopic dermatitis and asthma has been attributed to Filaggrin, a skin precursor of urocanic acid.  Function  Urocanic acid was detected in animal sweat and skin where, among other possible functions, it acts as an endogenous sunscreen or photoprotectant against UVB-induced DNA damage. Urocanic acid is found predominantly in the stratum corneum of the skin and it is likely that most of it is derived from filaggrin catabolism (a histidine-rich protein). When exposed to UVB irradiation, trans-urocanic acid is converted in vitro and in vivo to the cis isomer. The cis form is known to activate regulatory T cells. Some studies attribute filaggrin an important role in keeping the skin surface slightly acidic, through a breaking down mechanism to form histidine and subsequently trans-urocanic acid, however others have shown that the filaggrin–histidine–urocanic acid cascade is not essential for skin acidification. History Urocanic acid was first isolated in 1874 by the chemist Max Jaffé from the urine of a dog, hence the name ( = urine, and canis = dog).

Raw data, also known as primary data, is data (e.g., numbers, instrument readings, figures, etc.) collected from a source. In the context of examinations, the raw data might be described as a raw score. If a scientist sets up a computerized thermometer which records the temperature of a chemical mixture in a test tube every minute, the list of temperature readings for every minute, as printed out on a spreadsheet or viewed on a computer screen is \\"raw data\\". Raw data has not been subjected to processing, \\"cleaning\\" by researchers to remove outliers, obvious instrument reading errors or data entry errors, or any analysis (e.g., determining central tendency aspects such as the average or median result). As well, raw data has not been subject to any other manipulation by a software program or a human researcher, analyst or technician. It is also referred to as primary data. Raw data is a relative term (see data), because even once raw data has been \\"cleaned\\" and processed by one team of researchers, another team may consider this processed data to be \\"raw data\\" for another stage of research. Raw data can be inputted to a computer program or used in manual procedures such as analyzing statistics from a survey. The term \\"raw data\\" can refer to the binary data on electronic storage devices, such as hard disk drives (also referred to as \\"low-level data\\").  Generating data  Data has two ways of being created or made. The first is what is called 'captured data', and is found through purposeful investigation or analysis. The second is called 'exhaust data', and is gathered usually by machines or terminals as a secondary function. For example, cash registers, smartphones, and speedometers serve a main function but may collect data as a secondary task. Exhaustive data is usually too large or of little use to process and becomes 'transient' or thrown away. Examples In computing, raw data may have the following attributes: it may possibly contain human, machine, or instrument errors, it may not be validated; it might be in different area (colloquial) formats; uncoded or unformatted; or some entries might be \\"suspect\\" (e.g., outliers), requiring confirmation or citation. For example, a data input sheet might contain dates as raw data in many forms: \\"31st January 1999\\", \\"31/01/1999\\", \\"31/1/99\\", \\"31 Jan\\", or \\"today\\". Once captured, this raw data may be processed stored as a normalized format, perhaps a Julian date, to make it easier for computers and humans to interpret during later processing. Raw data (sometimes colloquially called \\"sources\\" data or \\"eggy\\" data, the latter a reference to the data being \\"uncooked\\", that is, \\"unprocessed\\", like a raw egg) are the data input to processing. A distinction is made between data and information, to the effect that information is the end product of data processing. Raw data that has undergone processing are sometimes referred to as \\"cooked\\" data in a colloquial sense. Although raw data has the potential to be transformed into \\"information,\\" extraction, organization, analysis, and formatting for presentation are required before raw data can be transformed into usable information. For example, a point-of-sale terminal (POS terminal, a computerized cash register) in a busy supermarket collects huge volumes of raw data each day about customers' purchases. However, this list of grocery items and their prices and the time and date of purchase does not yield much information until it is processed. Once processed and analyzed by a software program or even by a researcher using a pen and paper and a calculator, this raw data may indicate the particular items that each customer buys, when they buy them, and at what price; as well, an analyst or manager could calculate the average total sales per customer or the average expenditure per day of the week by hour. This processed and analyzed data provides information for the manager, that the manager could then use to help her determine, for example, how many cashiers to hire and at what times. Such information could then become data for further processing, for example as part of a predictive marketing campaign. As a result of processing, raw data sometimes ends up being put in a database, which enables the raw data to become accessible for further processing and analysis in any number of different ways. Tim Berners- Lee (inventor of the World Wide Web) argues that sharing raw data is important for society. Inspired by a post by Rufus Pollock of the Open Knowledge Foundation his call to action is \\"Raw Data Now\\", meaning that everyone should demand that governments and businesses share the data they collect as raw data. He points out that \\"data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives… because somebody takes the data and does something with it.\\" To Berners-Lee, it is essentially from this sharing of raw data, that advances in science will emerge. Advocates of open data argue that once citizens and civil society organizations have access to data from businesses and governments, it will enable citizens and NGOs to do their own analysis of the data, which can empower people and civil society. For example, a government may claim that its policies are reducing the unemployment rate, but a poverty advocacy group may be able to have its staff econometricians do their own analysis of the raw data, which may lead this group to draw different conclusions about the data set.

Bousman showed them a scene depicting a man cutting his own eye out of his skull to retrieve a key. Gray told Bousman about the conversation at Bob's Big Boy two years earlier, and Bousman revealed that he holds his production meetings at the restaurant, and that Saw II had been based on a screenplay Bousman wrote years earlier. Gray appeared in a small role in the film, and Bousman directed the music video for \\"Forget to Remember\\", which featured clips from the film and performance footage shot on one of the film's sets.

The film was conceived by Warhol as a parody of Sunset Boulevard (1950). It is the third film of the \\"Paul Morrissey Trilogy\\" produced by Andy Warhol. The other films in the trilogy include Flesh (1968) and Trash (1970). Plot Joey Davis is an unemployed former child star who supports himself as a hustler in Los Angeles. Joey uses sex to get his landlady to reduce his rent, then seduces Sally Todd, a former Hollywood starlet. Sally tries to help Joey revive his career but her status as a mediocre ex-actress proves to be quite useless. Sally's psychotic daughter, Jessica, further complicates the relationship between Sally and the cynical, emotionally numb Joey.

The film was also screened at the New York Film Festival on October 5, 1972 before opening the following day at New York's Festival Theatre and then expanding to the Waverly Theatre in Greenwich Village and the Rialto Theatre in Times Square on October 11. Reception The film was well received at Cannes and the New York Film Festival screening was standing-room only and was received by a generally enthusiastic crowd however three people walked out, with one lady claiming \\"It's the most disgusting thing I have ever seen\\" and referring to the films of the era \\"Make them, make them, just don't show them to anybody.\\" At a panel discussion following the New York Film Festival screening, Otto Preminger called it \\"depressingly entertaining\\". After previously ignoring most Warhol films, the New York Daily News reviewed the film, with Kathleen Carroll awarding it three stars. The advert for the film was censored in the Daily News with a t-shirt painted on Dallesandro and a bra strap on Miles. Andrea Feldman, who had a much larger role than in previous Warhol films,Andy Warhol 23: Andrea Feldman RIP, warholstars.org; accessed April 1, 2018. died shortly before the film was released, jumping from the fourteenth floor of her parents' apartment. Her performance garnered positive reviews, with Judith Crist, writing in New York magazine, \\"The most striking performance, in large part non-performance, comes from the late Andrea Feldman, as the flat-voiced, freaked-out daughter, a mass of psychotic confusion, infantile and heart-breaking.\\" The film grossed $28,000 in its first week.

He played for the clubs 1. FC Kattowitz (1934–1945) and FSV Frankfurt (1947–1960). He was part of the West Germany team which won the 1954 FIFA World Cup. He scored a goal in the first round 3–8 defeat by Hungary. However, this was the only match he played in the tournament, and he did not play in the final victory against Hungary. In total he played eight matches for Germany. After World War II Herrmann was a prisoner of war first in England, then in the United States before being sent back to camp 1008 in Derby, England. Football was being played in that camp and the officials of Derby County were told that there was a talented German POW. However Herrmann intended to get back to Germany as soon as possible. When released in 1947, one of his comrades in camp 1008, the pressman Alfred Ludwig attended to Herrmann and took him along to Frankfurt, where he joined FSV Frankfurt. Gifted with great ball control and a precise shot, Herrmann soon became a starter for FSV as an outside left. In 1952 AC Torino offered 60,000 D-Mark to Herrmann, but he declined due to being married with a son. Instead he rented a little smoke shop and an outlet for football beds. In 1958 Herrmann ended his career after a bad injury at the age of 35 and began coaching Seckbach 05 for a while. He died from a liver cirrhosis at the age of 39.

It was released in the Philippines on December 8, 1995 by BMG Records (Pilipinas), Inc.. The album became a highlight in Pinoy music as it introduced classic songs such as \\"Huwag Mo Nang Itanong\\", \\"Overdrive\\", and the popular \\"Ang Huling El Bimbo\\". It was both critically and commercially successful, certifying 11× Platinum by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI). To date, the album has sold over 400,000 units in the country, becoming the third biggest-selling album in OPM history and the biggest for any Filipino band or group. The album was re-issued in 2006 and 2008, just before the band's reunion concert. On September 7, 2010, the album was released on digital download through iTunes and Amazon.com MP3 Download.  Critical reception  The album received positive reviews from music critics, most of them pointing out the more mature and cohesive, brimming with enjoyable, substantive songs. In retrospect, David Gonzales of Allmusic gave the album four and a half out of five stars, noticing the more substantive sound with only a touch of \\"kiddie pop\\", where he described their previous record Circus as \\"lightweight and superficial\\". He applauded the song \\"Back2Me\\", saying \\"[the song] moves on a punkish vibe, the reverb-drenched guitars overlaid with the vocalist singing a catchy, snappy melody reminiscent of Green Day. He further described the opening reverb-edged guitar figure of \\"Waiting for the Bus\\" as \\"enchanting, as is the song itself, highlighted by a rapturous chorus\\". He likened the song \\"Poorman's Grave\\" and stated \\"In fact, there isn't a bad song on the album\\". He also compared \\"Ang Huling El Bimbo\\" to that of The Beatles, and added \\"This is a fine, enjoyable album, one of the best ever made in the Philippines.

Commercial performance The album debuted at number one on the Philippines nationwide album chart, with first- week sales of more than 125,000 copies sold. Sales figures for the first week are the highest of the band's career. The album was certified quadruple platinum in 1996, having shipped more than 175,000 copies in just under a month after its release, becoming the fastest selling album in '90s era. In 2012 this album accredited eleven times platinum by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI). This album holds the record for the most number of copies sold by a Filipino band of all times and second to Westlife self- titled album for best selling album by a band in the Philippines.

Best known for three Odia books — Mahabharata, Vilanka Ramayana and Chandi Purana — he was the first scholar to write in Odia. As an originator of Odia literature, his work has formed an enduring source of information for succeeding generations . Life The early life of Sarala Dasa is not accurately known. He was a contemporary of Gajapati king Kapilendra Dev.Though the date of his birth cannot be accurately determined, he can safely be placed to the 15th century AD.He was born at a village called Kanakavati Patana, also known as Kanakapura,Jagatsinghpur District. Sarala Dasa had no systematic early education, and what he achieved through self- education was attributed to the grace of Sarala, goddess of devotion and inspiration. Though his early name was Siddheswara Parida, he was later known as Sarala Dasa, or 'by the boon of Sarala'. (The title Dasa means a slave or a servant of a particular god or goddess. A long list of poets, preceding and succeeding Sarala Dasa, have names ending this way. For example: Vatra Dasa, Markanda Dasa, Sarala Dasa, Jagannatha Dasa, Balarama Dasa, and Yasovanta Dasa.) A story - similar to those told of other Indian poets, such as Kali Dasa, supposedly illiterate in early life until helped by the goddess Saraswati - tells that Siddheswara as a boy was once ploughing his father's field and singing so melodiously that the goddess Sarala stopped and listened to his song and endowed him with her power of composing beautiful poems. There are several indications in his Mahabharata that he served as a soldier in the army of the Gajapati King of Odisha. Sarala Dasa spent his last time at Bila Sarala but the native place Kanakavati Patana known as Kanakapura at Tentuliapada with a religious establishment known as Munigoswain, which marks as the traditional spot, where he composed his works. This period of his lifetime was known as the medieval period. Works As well as the three books for which he is best known - Mahabharata, Vilanka Ramayana and Chandi Purana - Sarala Dasa also wrote the book Laxmi Narayana Vachanika. The Adi Parva Mahabharata opens with a long invocation addressed to the Lord Jagannatha of Puri, from which it is known that Sarala Dasa started writing his Mahabharata in the reign of Kapileswar, otherwise known as Kapilendra Deva, the famous Gajapati king of Odisha (AD 1435–67). He tells us that Maharaja Kapilesvara with innumerable offerings and many a salute was serving this great deity and hereby destroying the sins of the Kali age. Though Sarala Dasa followed the main outline of the Sanskrit Mahabharata in writing the Odia Mahabharata, he made numerous deviations and added to it copiously the stories of his own creation and various other matters known to him. In the final form Sarala Dasa's Mahabharata is a new creation analogous to Kalidasa's Raghuvamsa based on the Ramayana.This contribution is a nearly verbatim reproduction of \\"Sarala Dasa, the Originator of the Oriya Literature\\" by Debendra Nath Bhoi and Priyadarshini Bakshi in the Orissa Review of October 2004 Mahabharata brought to light about the 18 parvas. The Chandi Purana was based on the well- known story of Goddess Durga killing Mahishasura (the buffalo headed demon) given in Sanskrit literature but here also the Odia poet chose to deviate from the original at several points. His earliest work, Vilanka Ramayana, was a story of the fight between Rama and Shahasrasira Ravana (thousand headed Ravana). The verse of Sarala Dasa is simple, forceful and musical, without artificiality. Applying colloquial words for his poetical purpose, his writing was free from Sanskritisation. His work can be seen as adapting the popular oral conventions of earlier Odia folk songs which were used in folk dances such as the Ghoda-nacha (Horse Dance), Dandanacha and Sakhinacha (Puppet Dance). One metrical peculiarity of these songs is that both the lines of a verse do not contain an equal number of letters though the last letters of both the lines produce the same sound. All Sarala Dasa's wors were composed with this metrical peculiarity, and so the metre used by him can be regarded as a direct descendant of that used in the folk songs. By the fifteenth century the Odia language had assumed almost its modern form and had become ripe for literary compositions. The predominant sentiment in Sarala Dasa's poem is not love but war. He was also motivated by a strong religious zeal to compose religious books in a language intelligible to all and to make them available to the general public in Odisha. He tells in no uncertain words that he composed his poems for the benefit of \\"human beings\\". There are several indications in his Mahabharata that he served as a soldier in the army of the Gajapati King of Odisha and his association with the army brought to him a variety of experiences. The stories he heard the battle scenes which he witnessed, the places that he visited with the company of the army the historical incidents and names that he could know all remained stored up in his mind to be utilized in his writings.

Waterstops are grouped in two distinct categories. Waterstops for joints without any movement of the adjoint concrete sections (construction cold joints) and waterstops for joints with movement of the adjoint concrete sections (dilation joints).  Types  Waterstops are manufactured from a variety of materials depending on the functionality and their intended use. The most common types are: * Waterstops made from extruded plastics such as flexible polyvinyl chloride PVC, polyethylene (PE) or thermoplastic vulcanized rubber (TPV); formed metal such as stainless steel, copper, or carbon steel - with or without polymeric coatings; extruded thermosets such as natural rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, or neoprene rubber. * Hydrophobic Polymer waterstops such as PVC, PE, TPV, or rubber are supplied to the construction site in coils (usually 25 m long), and are generally anywhere from 120 mm to 320 mm wide in a variety of profiles that are designed to simultaneously provide an interlock with the concrete they are installed in and to provide for a limited amount of movement within the joint. PVC, PE and TPV waterstops are made continuous for the length of the concrete joint by heat welding, using simple thermoplastic welding equipment.https://www.riw.co.uk/products/sodium-bentonite-systems/waterstop PE and TPV waterstops are generally installed in joints of secondary containment structures to prevent the passage of hazardous fluids other than water such as fuel oils, acids, or process chemicals.http://www.earthshield.com/typical_earthshield_waterstop.jpg The German national standards DIN 18541 http://www.baunormenlexikon.de/Normen/DIN/DIN%2018541-1/42cd691f-d0c0-4698-9cc8-882441c95636 and DIN 7865 http://www.baunormenlexikon.de/Normen/DIN/DIN%207865-2/b60d0b1b-498e-4b4b-a392-1cf434d1ba30 regulate dimensions and material properties of polymeric waterstops. * Metal waterstops are delivered in coils of up to 50 m with a typical dimension of 1.0 to 1.5 mm thickness and width of 250 to 300 mm. Splices can be welded, overlapped or joined with a sealant. A subcategory of metal waterstops is coated with polymeric and/or hydrophilic materials in order to provide a higher bond to the concrete and form a secondary barrier against waterseapage. These waterstops come in 25 m coils or in 2.0 - 2.5 m sections. Multi-purpose customized waterstops may also function as shuttering or crack-inducer for cold joints. * Hydrophilic or \\"water-loving\\" waterstops are strips of rubber, modified with a hydrophilic agent (such as bentonite) so they swell in the presence of moisture to effectively seal concrete construction joints. Hydrophilic strip applied waterstops should not be used in contraction or expansion joints per the instructions of most commercial manufacturers. Hydrophilic waterstops can only be effective if they are allowed to swell; therefore, water must be present to activate the hydrophilic agent. Initial leaking is possible until the waterstop expands to seal the joint. The American Concrete Institute recommends against the use of hydrophilic waterstops for hazardous fluids such as fuels, acids, and process chemicals, as the products may not swell as intended in fluids other than water. Hydrophilic waterstops are also available as moulded plugs and rings to create a seal around formwork spacers, center pens and tie rods.http://www.besealed.com/en/hydrophilic-waterstops See also Water stop References Category:Concrete Category:Architectural elements ","title":"Waterstop"},{"id":"6895510","text":"Karl Hohmann (18 June 1908, in Düsseldorf – 31 March 1974, in Benrath) was a German football (soccer) player.

The species is native to Australia. Although Collett's snake is not as venomous as other Australian snakes, it is capable of delivering a fatal bite, ranking nineteenth in the world's most venomous snakes. Taxonomy Collett's snake is one of several species in the genus Pseudechis commonly known as black snakes. A study of mitochondrial DNA showed it to be most closely related to the blue-bellied black snake (P. guttatus), with the Papuan black snake (P. papuanus) as the next closest relative to the pair. Belgian naturalist George Albert Boulenger described the species P. colletti in 1902, (Pseudechis colletti, new species). naming it in honour of Norwegian zoologist Robert Collett.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Pseudechis colletti, p. 56). A young snake had been collected by Collett, and Boulenger had noted its scale pattern to be distinct from the Papuan black snake. Description The most colourful member of the black snake genus Pseudechis, Collett's snake has dark brown to black upperparts, with pink or cream banding and sides, and pale yellow to orange underparts. The irregular bands are usually cross-shaped and are generally an orange-red colour. The underbelly is normally the same colour as the bands, but may have varied discolourisations or discoloured patches. Juveniles are usually the same colour as adults but generally have brighter shades and contrast more. It is similar in physical structure (but not appearance) to the red-bellied black snake. Collett's snake is usually between in total length (including tail). Males can reach up to in total length, while females can reach up to . At birth, it is usually in total length. Venom Previously thought to be only moderately venomous to people, Collett's snake is now known to have been responsible for severe envenomation, with cases proceeding to rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. Toxicity and symptoms of the venom resemble that of the mulga snake (P. australis). Early symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and headache, an anticoagulant coagulopathy, with risk of rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury within 24 hours if fluid replacement and black snake antivenom are not given. Despite the danger, its attractive markings have led it to being a popular snake in captivity. The venom produced by Collett's snake is similar to the Papuan black snake's and mulga snake's venom. The venom is cytotoxic and has haemolytic activity. Neurotoxins may also be found in its venom as well. P. colletti produces about 30 milligrams of venom in one strike. Black snake or tiger snake anti-venom can be administered. It is the world's nineteenth most venomous snake. Distribution and habitat Collett's snake is found in central western Queensland, and is diurnal. It is primarily found to the west of Queensland and spreading from the north to south. It is found in dry-barren areas or plains. Behaviour Diet The main diet of Collett's snake consists of amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals. Cannibalism is also known to occur in Collett's snake. Reproduction Mating of P. colletti occurs from early August to late October. Collett's snake is oviparous and may lay up to 20 eggs in a clutch. Reproduction in captivity is known to be highly successful.

History  Mammoet loading one of its own cars after a job in Utrecht. Mammoet Office Building 'The Bollard' in Schiedam Mammoet’s history started on 13 May 1807 in the Netherlands, when Dutch entrepreneur Jan Goedkoop founded a maritime company at the age of 25, with the purchase of a 140-ton cargo vessel. It was the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and Goedkoop foresaw that heavy transport would be in high demand. The company, called 'Gebroeders Goedkoop' (‘Goedkoop Brothers’), offered both cargo and passenger transport on water. In 1862 the company acquired its first tugboat, and from 1920 onwards, the company focused on tug and salvage services. In 1971 Goedkoop merged with Van Wezel from Hengelo, a company that specialized in heavy transport and cranes. The new company was called Mammoet Transport. In 1972 another company was acquired, Stoof Breda, which at that time was one of the Dutch market leaders in engineered heavy lifting and transport. In 1973 Mammoet Transport became a subsidiary of Koninklijke Nederlandse Stoomboot- Maatschappij (KNSM) in Amsterdam. At the same time the company name was changed to Mammoet. In 1973 Mammoet Shipping was founded. This enabled Mammoet to reinforce its \\"factory-to-foundation\\" concept, which allowed the company to transport large objects, such as vessels and modules, from the factory to their destination site – anywhere in the world – and install them. In 1981 KNSM and Mammoet became part of Nedlloyd Group. In 2000 Mammoet was acquired by and merged with Van Seumeren Kraanbedrijf, a company that had been founded in 1966. In 2001 Mammoet sold its maritime branch Mammoet Shipping to shipping company . One year after the merger, Mammoet writes world history with the successful salvaging operation of the Russian submarine Kursk in the Barents sea. In the years after the company becomes the global market leader in engineered heavy lifting and transport. Mammoet offers the following services: #Rental of heavy lifting and transport equipment and personnel; #Heavy lifting and transport services for the maintenance of plants and installations; #Heavy lifting and transport services for special projects, such as the construction of factories, installations and building, as well as large infrastructure projects. The company is active in the petrochemical industry, the energy sector, and off-shore and civil construction. Globally, approximately 5,000 people work for the company, in about 90 offices and branches. The head office of the holding company is located in Utrecht. The European headquarters, located in Schiedam, are quite special because it was constructed on a separate yard and sailed on a barge to its destination site, where it was driven to its final location with self-propelled modular transporters (SPMT) . Mammoet has offices in North America, South America, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. In July 2019 Mammoet signed an agreement to acquire the British company ALE.

Led by Commander, U.S. Sixth Fleet Navy Vice Admiral John \\"Boomer\\" Stufflebeem, JTF Lebanon officially accepted the mission on August 23, 2006 from U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) units, which had been operating in the region since mid-July 2006 shortly after hostilities began between Israel and Hezbollah militants based in Lebanon. Its area of responsibility focuses on a \\"joint operation area\\" (JOA) around the country of Lebanon to include a wide portion of the eastern Mediterranean Sea. JTF-L includes numerous ships and air assets, and more than 2,400 Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy active and reserve personnel. Most command element personnel are headquartered aboard the command flagship Mount Whitney (LCC/JCC 20) that is homeported in Gaeta, Italy. Mission Assist the U.S. government commitment to enhance regional stability by supporting U.S. joint interagency efforts involved in operations to aid Lebanon and protect American citizens. Specifically, JTF-L was tasked to directly support the American Embassy in Beirut and to help U.S. Department of State led humanitarian assistance efforts that are providing aid to the people of Lebanon Organization U.S. Marines Helicopter at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. Commander, Joint Task Force Lebanon, Vice Admiral Stufflebeem assigned two task force commanders with responsibility for the air, land and sea support to the American Embassy in Beirut and to execute the daily operations necessary to carry out the mission to assist Department of State-led efforts in the region. JTF-L Task Force ALPHA, Air and Land Forces Air Force Colonel Brad Webb leads Task Force “Alpha” consisting of air and land components and assigned more than 450 personnel from all branches of the U.S. military. As Commander, 352nd Special Operations Group, Colonel Webb arrived in the region on July 19, 2006 with more than 180 personnel from his home station at RAF Mildenhall, UK. Using Cyprus as a land-based headquarters, a group of MH-53M Pave Low heavy-lift helicopters completed an “air bridge” for taking people in and out of the American Embassy in Beirut, where a JTF-L Marine Corps Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Team (FAST) is located. Task Force Alpha is also responsible for MC-130P Combat Shadow refuelers, a small logistics element, and \\"Big Windy\\" Army CH-47 helicopters based out of Ansbach, GE. JTF-L Task Force BRAVO, Maritime Forces  Commander, Destroyer Squadron 60, Navy Captain John Nowell leads Task Force “Bravo” consisting of maritime assets in the JOA designated around Lebanon. Although many ships have conducted \\"sea bridge\\" and \\"escort\\" operations supporting JTF-L during the course of operations, Task Force Bravo has a typical naval presence of approximately 1,800 sailors, Marines and civilian mariners aboard platforms such as Gonzalez (DDG 66), Barry (DDG 52), Hue City (CG 66), Trenton (LPD 14), Wasp (LHD 1), HSV-2 Swift, Kanawha (T-AO 196) and the JTF Lebanon flagship Mount Whitney (LCC/JCC 20). History of operations According to Joint Task Force Lebanon/Task Force 59 spokesperson Navy Commander Darryn James, since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah militants began on July 12, 2006 the “sea bridge” and \\"air bridge\\" provided by U.S. Central Command and U.S. European Command assets helped nearly 15,000 American citizens safely depart Lebanon—one of the largest evacuations in U.S. military history. Dubbed Operation “Strengthen Hope”, Department of Defense (DoD) assets such as HSV-2 Swift were also instrumental in assisting in the distribution of millions of dollars (of a U.S. pledged $230 million) in humanitarian aid to the Lebanese people. Task Force 59 personnel, led by Marine Corps Brigadier General Carl Jensen, were the first to arrive in the “joint operation area” (JOA) region on July 16 where DoD assets evacuated 21 American citizens out of Beirut by helicopter on the first day. On July 21, DoD assets moved more than 3,000 people and brought the total of American citizens evacuated that week to more than 6,000. Sailors and Marines from the Iwo Jima (LHD 7) Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) including Nashville (LPD 13), Whidbey Island (LSD 41), Trenton (LPD 14) and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (24th MEU) arrived on station July 20 and began using utility landing craft (LCU) to safely transport American citizens wishing to depart Lebanon to avoid the hostilities. By July 24, more than 12,000 American citizens had been pulled out of Lebanon. Most of the American citizens were transported to the island nation of Cyprus. The transfer in military responsibility to the organization that would become JTF Lebanon led by Navy Vice Admiral John \\"Boomer\\" Stufflebeem, continued the DoD mission to protect American citizens, support the American Embassy in Beirut, assist the people of Lebanon through humanitarian aid, and help the multinational effort to provide lasting regional stability. Emblem origin The blue outer circle surrounding the emblem shows the continuity of the U.S. joint interagency effort between all elements involved in operations to aid Lebanon and protect American citizens. The gold olive branch wreath represents peaceful humanitarian assistance. Lebanon and Cyprus highlight the U.S. enduring partnerships with both governments and specific joint task force support to the American embassies in Beirut and Nicosia. The compass is derived from the U.S. European Command (EUCOM) emblem and indicates the JTF-L willingness to accomplish all assigned missions throughout the region whenever called upon. Within EUCOM, the circle emphasizes component commands providing Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines who are working together in the joint arena. The motto \\"Strengthen Hope\\" originates from remarks made by the President of the United States and communicates a strategic objective to support the people of Lebanon and provide lasting regional stability.

The station's studios are located on Central Parkway in Jacksonville's Southside section, and the transmitter is in the Arlington section. History of the 93.3 frequency In 1995 WAIA switched from Triple-A to modern rock, becoming \\"Planet Radio 93.3\\". Station history WJBT has been in its current format since 1992 (when it was at 92.7), playing Hip Hop and R&B; music. It is home to the nationally syndicated Doug Banks Morning Show (but has been replaced with Steve Harvey after its move to 93.3). Its only other competitor is its own sister station, Urban AC WSOL-FM. WJBT was the second Urban radio station to adopt \\"The Beat\\" branding after Los Angeles' KKBT. When it was at 92.7, it served the Jacksonville area, but it did not have enough power to serve the northernmost and westernmost portions of the metro because its frequency was licensed to Green Cove Springs, Florida. However, it had no effect on the Arbitron ratings as it is still among the Top 5 (sometimes 10) most listened to stations in the city. On November 2, 2007, Clear Channel spun off the 92.7 frequency to a private company (which moved the signal to the Palm Coast area as WBHQ)From The Florida Times-Union (November 2, 2007) and on the evening of December 25 of that same year, moved the station and its format to the more powerful 93.3 signal (formerly the home of Country outlet WROO).From Radioinsight (December 6, 2007) The reason for this was to comply with FCC ownership rules, since WJBT was in a waiver status in which Clear Channel was allowed to own six FMs and one AM in the market. But because of Clear Channel Communications being sold to a private investment group, WJBT's current frequency had to be divested. After Christmas Day 2007, 92.7 and 93.3 were simulcasting. However, on January 11, 2008, a new urban gospel station debuted on the 92.7 frequency named \\"Hallelujah FM\\", which is a moniker currently used for many Clear Channel-owned gospel stations nationwide. Also, the call letters were switched, with 92.7 becoming WROO and 93.3 becoming WJBT. With the move to a more powerful signal, WJBT also received an upgrade in power as well, going from 50 kW to 100 kW, thus covering most of Jacksonville and Northeastern Florida.

Cale and Lewis Merenstein produced the album. Recording Produced for a mere $15,000, Cale stated in his autobiography What's Welsh for Zen? that there wasn't \\"much originality on that album, it's just someone teaching himself to do something\\". He also \\"thought the songs were simplistic\\". He pieced together a band to play on the album, and they named themselves Penguin. However, the band didn't last beyond the recording sessions. Content The cover of the album features Cale with his face obscured by a glass mask over a nylon stocking, which he would later cite in his autobiography as symbolic of the content of the record: \\"You're not really seeing the personality\\". Release Vintage Violence was released on 25 March 1970 by record label Columbia. The album was re-released in remastered form in 2001. Critical reception Vintage Violence received mostly positive reviews. Rolling Stone magazine's Ed Ward said that the album sounds \\"like a Byrds album produced by Phil Spector who has marinated for six years in burgundy, anise and chili peppers\\". Ward was also quoted in Billboard magazine as saying, \\"I believe that this is destined to become one of the most important albums of the past few years.\\" Greil Marcus described it as \\"an exquisite, unheard solo album that was in some ways comparable to Van Morrison's Astral Weeks: the personal vision was that intense, the execution almost as graceful.\\" In his retrospective review, Mark Deming of AllMusic wrote: \\"John Cale had the strongest avant-garde credentials of anyone in The Velvet Underground, but he was also the Velvet whose solo career was the least strongly defined by his work with the band, and [...] Vintage Violence certainly bears this out.\\" Track listing Personnel Credits are adapted from the Vintage Violence liner notes. *John Cale – vocals; bass guitar; guitar; keyboards ;Penguin *Garland Jeffreys – guitar; backing vocals *Ernie Coralla – guitar *Sanford Konikoff – drums *Harvey Brooks – bass guitar *Stan Szelest – piano Production *John Cale – producer *Lewis Merenstein – producer *John McClure – executive production *Don Meehan – engineer *Jim Reeves – engineer *Isi Valeris – photography References External links * Category:John Cale albums Category:1970 debut albums Category:Albums produced by John Cale Category:Columbia Records albums Category:Albums produced by Lewis Merenstein ","title":"Vintage Violence"},{"id":"6895594","text":"\\"Fall into Sleep\\" is the fourth single from the Illinois band Mudvayne's third studio album Lost and Found. Music video A video was made for the song. It is unique for being the first use of animation in a Mudvayne video. The video depicts a family living in a suburban area. The son, one morning, goes to wake his father so they could go fishing, but the father receives a call to apparently go to work. The son is left saddened as his father leaves. On the way, the father experiences a nightmarish hallucination in which he sees mailboxes become creatures and ultimately crashes into a river. As he leaves his car, a metallic-robot fish promptly swallows him; once inside, the father is strapped to a table and is examined by a couple of extraterrestrial-like beings. The examination is interrupted when the metallic fish is caught, along with other fish, by a fisher boat. The fish are then taken to a factory, where the metallic fish is cut up and both the father and extraterrestrials fall out and into a can shipped to a market. Once there, the man's wife picks the very same can and takes it home. It's then revealed by this time that all this was just a bad dream the father was having; just as he wakes up, he smiles to his son, indicating that they will go fishing as the boy jumps in joy. As they both leave, the camera zooms in on the family's fishbowl - the fish has an extraterrestrial residing in the eye, implying that it wasn't a dream after all. Screenshot from the music video.

Opened in 1979, the mall has more than 30 stores. History The mall was opened in September 1979 with anchor stores Sears, A.W. Lucas & Co., and White Mart. The mall served for many years as an alternative to the larger Kirkwood Mall, originally featuring a three-screen movie theater and food court to complement the three anchor stores and several in-line tenants. Desmond's operated a 7,000-square-foot store from 1980 through 1986. Thrifty White began closing its White Mart operations in the late 1980s; the store at Gateway Mall was taken by Menards, a Wisconsin-based home improvement chain. Menards have re-located outside the mall, and a portion of the location was turned into a \\"Medical Mall\\" housing clinics managed by the PrimeCare Health Network, while the remainder of the former White Mart/Menards was converted to Hancock Fabrics. The middle anchor of the original three was A.W. Lucas. Their closure made way for Herberger's, which closed in 1994. The space, which later became Jacob's, then World's Greatest Deals, was later taken over by Conlin's Furniture. Other stores in the 1990s included teen fashion merchant, Deb, Payless Shoes, Juniques (gifts and collectables), House of Sund pet store. Weight Watchers held meeting at the mall during the late 80s/90s. For a brief period in the early 2000s, Gateway Mall was home to a second Bath and Body Works location as well as Prairie Peddler, a home and gift store. The mall's theaters were expanded to the \\"Midco 8\\", and at the time of expansion, the complex was the largest theater in the city. The theater remains today, competing with the nearby Grand 15 Theaters. The theater is now owned by Carmike Cinemas. For many years, the Gateway to Science Center had a location inside the center of the mall. This hands-on museum allowed visitors to try science-related activities and experiments. The Gateway to Science Center has moved to a new location outside the mall. The mall saw the loss of many tenants over the years, including the majority of the food court tenants. Currently, Subway and Gelato d'Italia, an Italian ice cream shop, are the only tenants in the food court. In 2006, Osco Drug, an original tenant, was converted to CVS/Pharmacy. On July 23, 2016, Antiques on Main, a local antique store, opened a second store inside the mall and had its grand opening, filling the space of the former Gateway to Science Center. Some customers complained, however, of high prices and a degration in customer service.https://bismarcktribune.com/news/columnists/jessica- holdman/antiques-on-main-moves-to- mall/article_efcb5ec9-677a-55e5-9584-a3adae4d552c.html In spring 2017, Not Too Shabby, an 8,000 square foot antiques and vintage merchandise/furniture store started having an inventory reduction sale. The sale slowly grew from 20% off storewide to 75% off storewide until it was announced the store would close its doors on July 31, 2017. The reason being the owner said she was \\"retiring\\". Some customers speculate, however, that they essentially priced themselves out of business. On August 12, 2017, all remaining inventory that did not sell or was not put out in the showroom was sold at auction. The empty space was quickly filled by BismanGuns and Bret Ruff Auctions, a firearm store and auction service.https://www.facebook.com/Not-Too-Shabby- Bismarck-241527452707220/ In mid-late 2017, Classic Design, a vintage merchandise/furniture store, announced it would be closing after over 20 years in business in Bismarck (six of which were in the mall), and started inventory reduction sales, hoping to be closed for good by January 2018. The reason is said to be the owners retiring. By September 2018, however, the store had not yet closed. Gateway Mall today Since January, 2003, the mall has been sold three times. On May 10, 2006 it was announced that the center was purchased by Raymond Arjmand, of Encino, California at a purchase price of $13.25 million.Bismarck Tribune - Bismarck News - Gateway Mall sold It celebrated a re-opening on November 18, 2006, and is now known as \\"Gateway Fashion Mall\\". Arjmand has completed a $10 million renovation to the mall. Macy's was mentioned as an additional anchor store in 2006, but never came to fruition. A two-story addition including a vaulted atrium and space for up to six new stores was planned, but also never came to fruition.Bismarck Tribune- Gateway has leads on stores Under the new ownership the mall is leased at 85% of its capacity.Bismarck Tribune- Getting it at Gateway Major tenants vacate In 2008, CVS/pharmacy announced they were leaving Gateway Mall upon constructing their own freestanding store. On June 26, 2009, Conlin's Furniture and Joy's Hallmark announced intentions to vacate the mall.Bismarck Tribune - Two stores leaving Gateway Mall This marks the fourth anchor store to depart from the space occupied by Conlin's Furniture in the mall's thirty-year existence. Joy's Hallmark had been a tenant at the mall for over twenty years. On July 27, 2016, Hancock Fabrics closed after filing Chapter 11 Bankruptcy which left Sears as the only anchor left.http://965thefox.com/gateway-fashion-malls- hancock-fabrics-closing-its-doors/ On January 4, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 103 stores nationwide. The store closed in April 2018. The closure of Sears left the mall with no anchors left.http://bismarcktribune.com/business/local/bismarck-sears-to- close/article_864c28f3-3294-5404-bcbd-f94f2969ea8d.html In February 2018, Planet Fitness announced it was planning to move into the former Hancock Fabrics space.https://www.bismarckcafe.com/blogs/172393/planet-fitness- opening-at-gateway-mall References External links *Gateway Fashion Mall website *Mid-Dakota Clinic *Gateway Mall history Category:Shopping malls in North Dakota Category:Shopping malls established in 1979 Category:Buildings and structures in Bismarck, North Dakota ","title":"Gateway Fashion Mall"},{"id":"6895601","text":"Bernhard \\"Berni\\" Klodt (26 October 1926 – 23 May 1996) was a German football player. He was born in Gelsenkirchen-Bismarck; the goalkeeper Hans Klodt was his brother. Football career In his club career, Klodt played mainly for FC Schalke 04. He debuted in the senior team of the club on 17 January 1943 at the age of 16, where he scored a goal in a 6–2 victory over Westfalia Herne. Aged 36, Klodt ended his career in 1963 with the start of the Bundesliga. In his last game, he scored the only goal in Schalke's 1–0 victory against the Bulgarian national team on 18 June 1963. He played in 330 Oberliga West games in which he scored 129 goals. Between 1950 and 1959, Klodt played 19 times and scored three goals for the Germany national football team. He was part of the 1954 FIFA World Cup-winning squad, and also played in the 1958 FIFA World Cup. During the 1954 World Cup, Klodt had started in the outside right position instead of Helmut Rahn. He played in both games against Turkey. Although he played fairly well in both games, Sepp Herberger decided to replace him with Rahn for the quarterfinal against Yugoslavia. Herberger's decision at first was not exclusively greeted with enthusiasm by the press, but after Rahn had scored against Yugoslavia, Klodt was out of the team for good. The basis for Herberger's decision was his hope that Rahn with his unconventional style and shooting prowess was more likely to turn around a game than any other player. Contrary to Rahn, Klodt was said to be less of an individualist and more of a teamplayer. After football After his retirement from football, Klodt among other things coached the youth team of FC Schalke 04 and also worked as salesman for a brewery. After suffering a heart attack and a stroke in 1990, he was paralysed from the right.

In 1918 the General Assembly designated a 4002-mile (6441 km) state highway system to be maintained by the Commission. Beginning in 1922, the Commission was authorized to add annually mileage equal to 2.5% of the original system (100 miles or 161 km). These highways were numbered from 1 into the 20s; by 1922 suffixed spurs had been added (such as 7X from 7). In 1923, the first renumbering was implemented, in which State Routes 1 to 9 became 31 to 39. The spurs were renamed to use numbers rather than letters (such as 114 from 11), and four- digit numbers were used for spurs of spurs (such as 1141 from 114) or for \\"rollovers\\" (such as 1010 from 10, as 101 to 109 were all in use).Virginia Highways Project: A History Of Route Numbering The United States Numbered Highways were designated in late 1926. In 1928, the state routes were renumbered again; all the spurs were instead numbered by district, using the district number as the first digit. State routes that were also U.S. Routes had signage removed, but continued to be referred to by the Department of Highways (renamed from the State Highway Commission in 1927). In 1932, the Byrd Road Act promoted by former Governor Harry F. Byrd and the Byrd Organization created the state's \\"Secondary System\\" of roads in the counties. Virginia's incorporated towns were provided a local option to participate, and all the counties in Virginia were given the option of turning this responsibility over to the state. However, Virginia's independent cities were excluded, typical of the Byrd Organization and its leader's rural priorities and political power base. Only four counties of more than 90 initially opted not to join the system. Of these, Nottoway County opted to join the state system in 1933, and in the 1950s, Warwick County became an independent city and was then consolidated with another, forming the modern City of Newport News. (By the end of the 20th century, only Arlington and Henrico Counties were continuing to maintain their own roads.) Generally, when an area became part of an independent city, through annexation, merger, consolidation, or conversions, the secondary roads passed from the state system to local responsibility. An exception was made by the General Assembly in the former Nansemond County, which like Warwick County, became an independent city (in 1972) and then 18 months later, consolidated with neighboring Suffolk in 1974. Under that special arrangement, VDOT maintained secondary routes in Suffolk until July 1, 2006. This arrangement eventually led to new conflicts over ownership and responsibility for the circa 1928 Kings Highway Bridge across the Nansemond River on State Route 125, which was closed in 2005 by VDOT for safety reasons. Aaron Applegate, VDOT, city of Suffolk battle over closed Kings Highway Bridge , The Virginian-Pilot, May 1, 2006John Warren, Flooding blamed on clogged ditches, The Virginian-Pilot, July 11, 2006 The DoT took over road maintenance from most counties in 1932, forming the state secondary system. These routes were assigned numbers from 600 up, so the primary routes were renumbered again in 1933, assigning smaller ranges to each district. State routes with numbers that conflicted with U.S. Routes were renumbered, and the unsigned concurrencies were dropped. The numbers from 2 to 9 were again assigned (1 was not because of U.S. Route 1): *State Route 2: State Route 50 *State Route 3: State Routes 37 and 827 *State Route 4: Many routes, including part of State Route 17 *State Route 5: State Route 41, part of State Route 39, and State Route 835 *State Route 6: Part of State Route 18 and State Route 19 *State Route 7: Parts of State Routes 37 and 54 and all of State Route 822 *State Route 8: State Route 23 *State Route 9: State Route 25 State Route 10 is the smallest number to survive from the 1918 system to the present day, though in a greatly modified form. State Route 35 is largely the same as the original SR 5, renumbered in 1923. Two more renumberings took place in 1940, when routes ending at state lines were renumbered to match the adjacent state, and in 1958, when routes with numbers used for Interstate Highways were renumbered.

He is a former WEC Welterweight Champion, a UFC veteran, and a contestant on The Ultimate Fighter 4 reality show. He has also competed in Pancrase, Shooto, King of the Cage, M-1 Global, KSW, and Bellator. He is known for his flashy dress, colorful vocabulary, outlandish personality and use of the spinning backfist in competition. Early life and martial arts background Carter was born in Chicago, Illinois and served for six years in the United States Marine Corps before beginning his profession as a fighter. Carter attended Proviso East High School. He began his martial arts training in Greco-Roman wrestling at Triton Community College in River Grove, Illinois before transferring to Carson-Newman College in Tennessee where he began studying judo and jujutsu, under Dr. Stephen Terrell and Dr. Stephen Karr. He was also an All-American wrestler and participated in the Olympic trials. After a semester of studying judo, Carter enrolled in the Tennessee state championship in the white-green, brown, and black belt divisions. He won state titles in the white-green and brown divisions, and placed second in the black belt division. His instructor awarded him his brown belt after his performance. Carter later added sanshou and Shidōkan Karate to his repertoire. In addition to his MMA career, he also holds a record of 57 wins and 5 losses as a professional kickboxer.

He applied as a contestant for the fourth season of The Ultimate Fighter a reality show on Spike. The season, subtitled \\"The Comeback\\", featured MMA veterans whose careers in the UFC could use a jumpstart. Carter joined Team Mojo and was picked to fight first against Team No Love's Rich Clementi. Carter arrived to the show out of shape and struggled through his initial workout. With help from his cornerman Matt Serra, however, Carter won a two-round decision over Clementi. In the second round, Carter fought a rematch with Matt Serra. Much was made of Carter's come-from-behind KO by spinning backfist in their previous encounter. Though Carter landed another spinning backfist, he lost the fight by decision.

Neither of the metro stations nor the railway station are interconnected, passengers being required to use the next station (Basarab) to switch from M1 to M4 directly, without having to validate a ticket. The first station was opened on 24 December 1987 as the eastern terminus on an extension from Crângași. On 17 August 1989, the extension to Dristor was opened. The M4 station was opened on 1 March 2000 as part of the inaugural section of the line from Gara de Nord to 1 Mai. It is very unusual mainly due to its story: Initially designed as a bilevel station, the layout of it was heavily changed, leading into a one-year delay until its opening (this involved abandoning its bilevel plan and inserting a tight turn going towards Piața Victoriei). One can notice the structures made for the bi-level tunnel, in the tunnel towards Basarab. The second station began construction during 1989, but the construction work froze due to the economic downturn following the revolution in the same year. Construction on line M4 resumed in 1996, by removing the water filled in the tunnels, and it was opened in 2000. Owing to this current configuration, passengers have to exit the system and enter again, despite there being a sort of connection tunnel between the stations. A widely circulated urban story tells how supposedly the upper deck of one of the bilevel tunnels served as a siding, where trains could be left overnight in case there was no capacity in other places. Supposedly, one Astra IVA set was left in the upper deck but the tracks leading to the sidings were destroyed by construction work, and was left there abandoned, in its place, another set with the identical numbers was delivered. The story further claims that the set was eventually found in working order after 1989, but since it could not be removed, it was left there and thieves, years later, broke into the tunnels and dismantled parts from the unit.

His adventures first appeared in publication in 1883. Sandokan is the protagonist of 11 adventure novels. He is known throughout the South China Sea as the \\"Tiger of Malaysia\\". Sandokan series Emilio Salgari wrote several novels chronicling the adventures of Sandokan and Yanez, two of his most legendary creations. They are introduced in The Tigers of Mompracem, which portrays their relentless struggle against the Dutch and British powers that seek to wipe them out. In subsequent novels, they battle against James Brooke, the Raja of Sarawak, and also travel to India to measure themselves against the Thugs, a notorious band of stranglers devoted to the goddess Kali. The original series * The Mystery of the Black Jungle (I Misteri della Jungla Nera, 1895) * The Pirates of Malaysia (I Pirati della Malesia, 1896) * The Tigers of Mompracem (Le Tigri di Mompracem, 1900) * The Two Tigers (Le due Tigri, 1904) * The King of the Sea (Il Re del Mare, 1906) * Quest for a Throne (Alla conquista di un impero, 1907) * Sandokan to the Rescue (Sandokan alla riscossa, 1907) * Return to Mompracem (La riconquista del Mompracem, 1908) * The Brahman (Il Bramino dell'Assam, 1911) * An Empire Crumbles (La caduta di un impero, 1911) (published posthumously) * Yanez' Revenge (La rivincita di Yanez, 1913) (published posthumously) Follow-up works Other Sandokan titles were written by Italian authors Luigi Motta, Emilio Fancelli and by Salgari's son Omar. Paco Ignacio Taibo II has written a recent Sandokan novel entitled The Return of the Tigers of Malaysia. Gianni Padoan wrote a series of novels that are declaredly a sci-fi reinterpretation of the Tigers of Malaysia series by Emilio Salgari: I misteri della stella nera (Mondadori 1978), I pirati della galassia (Mondadori 1978), Le tigri di Moonpracer (Mondadori 1979), Alla conquista di Rigel (Mondadori 1980). Fictional biography Sandokan is the son of Kaigadan, the last of a dynasty of rulers of Borneo, whose parents were massacred by the British to seize the throne. Having sworn revenge, Sandokan assembles a group of rebel pirates, the Tigers of Mompracem, to attack them, and earns the personal name of the Tiger of Malaysia. Stranded in Labuan, Sandokan is recovering of his wounds in the house of Lord James Guillonk, when he meets the lord's niece Marianna, the \\"Pearl of Labuan\\", with whom he falls in love. Sandokan escapes, but reunites with Marianna and later marries her. After his defeat by the British, Sandokan stills frees his men and apparently gives up piracy and escapes to Java with his wife. Sandokan and his friend Yanez De Gomera go on to help Kammamuri fight James Brooke, the \\"Exterminator\\", the White Rajah of Sarawak, so as to free Tremal-Naik. Sandokan later has to help Tremal-Naik again, when his daughter is kidnapped by the Thugs of the Kali, a sect of killers commanded by Suyodhana, the \\"Tiger of India\\". Following many battles over a period of years, Sandokan defeats all of his enemies and retires as rajah of Kini Balù. His friend Yanez is appointed rajah of Assam.  Characteristics  Sandokan character is inspired by the Spanish naval captain Carlos Cuarteroni Fernández. He is depicted by Salgari as a gallant pirate. He is described as tall, charming, very muscular, slender, and attractive, with cold, black eyes, a fierce and severe look, and a big turban on his head. Unlike his troops, who are described as mostly half- naked, Sandokan always wears fine oriental clothes, generally red silk with embroidered gold, and long, red, leather boots. Sandokan is a formidable fighter, brave, and ruthless with his enemies, but kind, generous, and faithful to his friends. He has absolute leadership over his men, and is often shown as having no fear, with Yanez playing as a sort of counterweight to his impulsive nature.

Carole André was cast as Lady Marianna Guillonk, Philippe Leroy played Sandokan's trusted friend and lieutenant Yanez De Gomera. The role of the main antagonist James Brooke was performed by Adolfo Celi. The series included these episodes: *\\"The Kidnapping\\" *\\"The Mysterious Prince\\" *\\"The Tiger Hunt\\" *\\"The Offer\\" *\\"Betrayal\\" *\\"The Battle\\" In 1977, Kabir Bedi reprised his role in the film La tigre è ancora viva: Sandokan alla riscossa! (The Tiger Lives Again: Sandokan To The Rescue!). The TV series theme song, \\"Sandokan\\", was composed by Oliver Onions (a pseudonym of the De Angelis brothers), and made the top 10 in many European countries, albeit mostly in the translated English version. A 2004 documentary, Sandokan's Adventure, detailed the making of the series. Two further television series were made The Return of Sandokan in 1996 and The Son of Sandokan in 1998, with Kabir Bedi again reprising his role. Animated series Sandokan the animated series was released in 1992 by Spanish animation studio BRB International, and broadcast in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 and Republic of Ireland on RTE Two. This children's animated show, written by Doug Stone and Dave Mallow, is loosely based on Salgari's novels. In the show, Sandakan (here an anthropomorphized tiger) is an usurped prince who travels the seas as a pirate seeking to reclaim his rightful throne from the Rajah of Sarawak. The first nine episodes of the series are available in three DVD volumes in the United Kingdom. A condensed version of the series was released as an animated movie, The Princess and the Pirate, in 1995. Another animated series was released in 1998 from a coproduction among RAI on 1993-94, Studio Sek, and Mondo TV and broadcast in Italy on Rai 1. This series was composed into three parts: Sandokan, la tigre della Malesia (Sandokan, the Tiger of Malaysia, produced in 1998); Sandokan, la tigre ruggisce ancora (Sandokan, the Tiger roars again, 2000); and Sandokan, le due tigrie (Sandokan, The Two Tiger, 2004). The adventures of this 26-episode cartoon series are based on the stories of Emilio Salgari. The story takes place in the second half of the 19th century, and is situated in the Malaysian archipelago, Borneo, and India. Co-produced with RAI Italy and TF1 France, the series achieved a big success such that it a second series was decided to be produced on this character. An interactive computer game, a video special, a sticker album, along with other merchandising articles such as books, toys, shirts, bags, etc. based on the series are now available.

Because of a lack of on-screen voice credits on cartoons throughout the 1930s, identifying many actors has been a challenge to historians, resulting in incorrect guesses, especially with many female voices portraying young animals that sound very similar.

The song title was transliterated at the contest as \\"Hi\\", and has also been credited in other media as \\"Khay\\", \\"Jai\\", \\"Hay\\" and \\"Chai\\". The song is a moderately up-tempo number. The singer begins by singing that she is still alive, and that despite her thorns, she also has many flowers. As the song continues, this is revealed to be a metaphor for the people of Israel (the song is ambiguous as to whether this refers to the modern state or the global Jewish community) surviving various attempts at destroying it. The song had further profound meanings since it was performed on German soil with the Holocaust background and in the city of Munich, the site of the Munich massacre in 1972. Haza performed the entry with five backup singers, who were all dressed in yellow costumes. The song was performed sixteenth on the night, following Denmark's Gry with \\"Kloden drejer\\" and preceding Portugal's Armando Gama with \\"Esta balada que te dou\\". At the close of voting, it had received 136 points, placing 2nd in a field of 20. Haza also recorded the song in English, German and French, entitled \\"High\\", \\"Frei\\" and \\"Va, Va, Va\\" respectively. Israel opted not to enter the 1984 Contest, but returned to the contest the following year. Thus, the song was succeeded as Israeli representative at the 1985 Contest by Izhar Cohen with \\"Olé, Olé\\". Ofra Haza went on to have a worldwide hit in 1988 with a dance remix of the Yemeni/Jewish traditional \\"Im Nin'alu\\", which became the start of a very successful international career. This was cut short in 2000, when Haza very unexpectedly died at the age of 42.

Social Security Administration. was an American author and broadcast journalist; a pioneer, with such others as Mary Marvin Breckinridge and Sigrid Schultz, of female journalism in the United States. She worked for and with Edward R. Murrow during World War II, although despite her significant contributions she, along with a handful of other journalists closely associated with Murrow, were rarely recognized in the famed group of war correspondents known as the Murrow Boys. She also wrote numerous books on food and cooking from the 1940s through 1981. Early life Wason was born in Delphi, Indiana, to judge James Paddock Wason of Toledo, who was appointed to the 39th Indiana Circuit Court in 1906, and Susan Una Edson Wason, who was born in Navesink, New Jersey.Indiana, Birth Certificates, 1907-1940 Wason grew up in Delphi, where she studied classical violin and painting. She eventually enrolled in Purdue University hoping to become a dress designer. Wason graduated from Purdue in 1933 with the Great Depression in full swing. Work was not easy to come by and she settled on a job selling yard goods in the basement of Ayres Department Store in Indianapolis. Her first broadcasting experience came doing a program for a radio cooking school in Lexington, Kentucky. \\"I was young and wanted to see the world. I had no money, so I decided I would become a journalist,\\" she said in a 1997 interview. Foreign correspondent Transradio Press Service Wason went around New York City telling any editor that would listen that she was going to Europe and wanted to be their correspondent. When she reached Transradio Press Service, a new wire service, the company president Herbert Moore asked her where she expected to go. Her reply: \\"Wherever things are happening.\\" In 1938 Wason found herself in Prague, Czechoslovakia, working for Transradio. She was there when the Nazis took over. She accompanied Hungarian troops as they entered the country and then traveled to Rome for Neville Chamberlain's meetings with Benito Mussolini. The pay at Transradio, however, was not enough, and she had to return to New York, discouraged. CBS News After a stint doing promotional recipes for Welch's Grape Juice she soon returned to Europe as a regular stringer for CBS's nascent news division, checking in with their Berlin correspondent William L. Shirer, who relied heavily on her work as a stringer as time went on. Soon after, Wason was on her way to Norway after the Nazi invasion began. Her cross into Norway was anything but routine. She eluded border guards and hitched a ride in a truck across the mountainous terrain where she hid in the woods to wait out an air raid. She interviewed numerous wounded British soldiers and found out just how poorly the Allied defense had gone. She returned to Stockholm and her broadcast by hitching rides and walking. Wason was regarded as an excellent writer and reporter. However, her contributions went largely unappreciated by CBS management in New York. In April 1940 she gave a live report about women spies in Norway. The immediate response from CBS was criticism of her voice, with management saying that it was \\"too young and feminine\\" for war news. She felt betrayed when they insisted that she find a man to read her reports on air, particularly after the man she found, Winston Burdett, ended up with a contract and long career with CBS. Despite the setbacks, she left Sweden in the spring of 1940 in search of the next big story, and she soon ended up in Greece after short stops in the Balkans and Istanbul. With an expected Italian invasion of Greece on the horizon, CBS again hired Wason. She also started stringing for Newsweek during this time. In October 1940, when Italian forces began to move into Greece, a cable came from CBS: \\"Find male American broadcast 4U.\\" Though CBS still saw her gender as an impediment, Wason strove on. During her six months in Greece, her voice on the radio, Phil Brown, a secretary at the American embassy, introduced each broadcast with, \\"This is Phil Brown in Athens, speaking for Betty Wason.\\" Wason remained in Athens through the winter of 1940 and refused to leave the next spring, April 1941. She was listed as Athens Correspondent for CBS in the 1941 as German air attacks ramped up in Greece's capital. When the Nazis took Athens, Wason was stuck in the city for several weeks. Though America still remained \\"neutral\\" in the war, Wason and several other reporters were held by the Germans, who refused to allow anyone to broadcast. Eventually, Wason left Athens on a Deutsche Lufthansa plane bound for Vienna.She based her 1943 book, Miracle in Hellas on a diary she kept during this period. It is held by the Library of Congress. Also on the plane were Wes Gallagher of the Associated Press and George Weller of the Chicago Daily News. Once in Vienna, the Gestapo detained the entire group under suspected espionage. Soon the male reporters were released, but Wason was kept another week for, according to her, \\"reasons never divulged except that the police wanted to know more about me.\\" When a CBS executive intervened, the Gestapo released her. She had married a Mr. Hall by 1943. On her return to the United States, Wason was inundated with interview requests, lecture requests and press attention. She recalled, \\"Everyone made a fuss over me but CBS,\\" Wason wrote. \\"When I went to see [news director] Paul White, he dismissed me with, 'You were never one of our regular news staff.' Then what, I wondered, had I been doing for CBS all that time in Greece?\\" After CBS Wason turned her wartime work as a correspondent into a long career in broadcasting and writing. After leaving CBS, she worked as women's editor at Voice of America, and as an editor at McCalls and, Woman's Home Companion. Wason also spent six years moderating Author Rap Sessions on NBC Radio. She lived in Washington, D.C., New York, and Portugal while working in public relations and as a freelance writer. In 1985, to be nearer to her family, she moved to Seattle, where she died in 2001. Publications Wason authored 24 books after leaving CBS, mostly about one of her longtime favorite hobbies, cooking, though her most successful book was her 1942 story of the Axis invasion of Greece, Miracle in Hellas: The Greeks Fight On. She wrote that the book \\"was a resounding success. But the tough struggle to make it as a woman correspondent, ending with the cruel rebuff by CBS, cooled my desire for more overseas war reporting.\\" In 1998, at age 86, Wason wrote about macular degeneration, an affliction which stole most of her eyesight and rendered her legally blind.

The aim is to encourage thoughtful discussion and a love of reading in young people. The intent of literature circles is \\"to allow students to practice and develop the skills and strategies of good readers\\" (DaLie, 2001). Background of literature circles Literature circles were first implemented in 1982 by Karen Smith, an elementary school teacher in Phoenix, Arizona. Handed a box of odd-and-end novels by a fellow teacher, Karen took them and promptly forgot about them. Later that year, some of her fifth grade students expressed an interest in reading them, organized themselves loosely into groups, and started to discuss the novels. Smith was surprised at the degree of their engagement with the books and the complexity of their discussions, they had no outside help or instruction from their teacher (Daniels, 1994). Literature circles evolved into reading, study, and discussion groups based around different groupings of students reading a variety of different novels. They differ from traditional English instruction where students in classroom all read one \\"core\\" novel, often looking to the teacher for the answers and the meaning and literary analysis of the text. They highlight discussion, student response, free choice, and collaboration, \\"providing a way for students to engage in critical thinking and reflection\\" (Schlick Noe, 2004). Well-run literature circles highlight student choice; occur over an extended period of time as part of a balanced Literacy program; involve numerous structured and unstructured opportunities for student response and interpretation; and incorporate assessment and evaluation that includes self-assessment and numerous extension projects. Research on literature circles is conducted primarily by Harvey Daniels (1994, 2002, 2004), Katherine L. Schlick Noe (1995, 1999, 2001, 2003), Bonnie Campbell Hill (1995, 2001, 2003), and Nancy J. Johnson (1995, 1999, 2001); they are credited with most of the research and teacher resources around this approach to student choice and reading; however, numerous other researchers, including Kathy Short and Kathryn Mitchell Pierce (1990), Jerome Harste, Kathy Short and Carolyn Burke (1988), Katherine Samway (1991), Suzi Keegan and Karen Shrake (1991) have conducted research and classroom-based studies. This approach to reading and learning looks to some of the best practices and theory from collaborative learning and instructional scaffolding theory. Reader-response criticism, independent reading, and student-centered learning comprise most of the theoretical underpinning of literature circles. Literature circles are not to be confused with book discussion clubs, currently popular in some circles. While both book clubs and literature circles focus on discussion of books in small group settings, book clubs have a more loosely structured agenda for discussions and are not usually tied into literary analysis such as thematic or symbolic analysis. Furthermore, literature circles are the domain of the classroom, both at the elementary and secondary level, and involve various types of assessment (including self- assessment, observations and conferences) and evaluation (portfolios, projects and student artifacts) by both the teacher and the student. They can be used at all grade and ability levels. Furthermore, current research indicates that peer collaboration has a positive effect on student learning and performance in Language Arts (Fall et al., 2000), increases student learning, and also improves reading comprehension and content-knowledge (Klinger, Vaugn and Schumm, 1998, cited in Daniels, 2002).

Often the conversations digress to topics relating to the students or loosely to the books, but should eventually return to the novel. #The teacher serves as a facilitator, observer, listener and often a fellow reader, alongside the students. The teacher is not an instructor. #Students are given roles or jobs to complete for each group meeting. #The teacher should model how students should facilitate each role or job. #Evaluation is by teacher observation and student self-evaluation and should also include extension projects. #A spirit of playfulness and fun pervades the room. #New groups form around new reading choices. Discussion prompts can be given by the teacher to encourage a direction for the students' responses, such as \\"How does the setting affect the characters?\\" \\"What are alternative solutions to the character's conflicts in the text?\\" \\"What connections can you make with regard to the character's situation(s)?\\" Implementation considerations Students begin literature circles by participating in mini-lessons on how to participate in a discussion group. To begin with they may be given role sheets to assist them in taking notes on their reading and preparing for the discussion. Sticky notes (e.g. PostIt notes) are often distributed by teachers to assist students in recording their thoughts about text elements, as they make access easy to various pages in the book. Clip boards may assist children in using their role sheets when groups use floor space to conduct their discussions. As group discussions evolve and improve, ideally the role sheets should eventually be used only for redirecting the discussion when students get off-track. In fact, Daniels notes that \\"the goal of role sheets is to make the role sheets obsolete\\" (Daniels, 1994, p. 75). What he means by this is that role sheets help students stay on task and focus their discussions. As students become more comfortable in their groups and learn the level of discourse and response that is expected of them, ideally they will no longer need the role sheets at all: \\"In many classrooms, the role sheets are abandoned as soon as groups are capable of lively, text-centered, multifaceted discussions\\" (Daniels, 1994, p. 75). Schlick Noe and Johnson note that role sheets take focus and energy away from group discussions: \\"Students can learn collaborative and individual accountability strategies to make their discussions work without the constraints of role sheets\\" (Schlick Noe and Johnson, 1999). Most teachers starting out may, however, wish to assign roles to students to help them learn some of the structures of Literature Circles and to aid in classroom management. Roles in literature circles The following is a list of roles which give a thinking task to each group member. Students divide the tasks among themselves in each group. As the groups reconvene each session, students switch roles, so that by the end of the literature circles \\"unit,\\" each student will have the opportunity to participate in each role. Again, the ideal is to eventually do away with the roles, although many teachers opt to continue using the roles to assist group on-task behaviour. One thing to keep in mind: Readers who are deeply engaged with a book and eager to talk about it with others may not need the structure of roles. Many teachers discover that the roles feel restrictive to some students and can become a disincentive to take part in literature circles. Harvey Daniels always intended roles to be a temporary scaffold to support students as they learn to talk about books in small groups. Discussion facilitator This role involves developing a list of questions that the group might discuss about the section of the novel to be discussed for that meeting. Questions should be designed to promote lively conversation and insights about the book; they should be open questions. A person with this task asks these questions of the group to prompt discussion; overall, the job is to keep the group talking and on-task. Questions that a student might ask could be: \\"What was going through your mind when you read this passage?\\" or \\"How did the main character change as a result of this incident?\\" Commentator This role involves locating a few significant passages of text that are thought-provoking, funny, interesting, disturbing, or powerful. The quotations are copied down with properly cited page numbers. A student with this task can read the passages out loud him/herself or ask other group members to read as well. Commentary and discussion will be generated from these passages. and also draw a part of the scene that locates where the person took place Illustrator As the term implies, this job entails drawing, sketching, or painting a picture, portrait or scene relating to the appropriate section of the novel. Collages from magazines, images from the internet, and other media can also be used. The student with this role then shares the artwork with the group, explaining the passage(s) that relate to the art. Often students who do not like to write do very well with this role. The pictures usually generate interesting group conversations. Connector or reflector This role involves locating several significant passages in the novel and connecting these passages to real life. The connections might relate to school, friends or family, home, the community, or they might relate to movies, celebrities, the media etc. Students should also feel free to connect incidents or characters with other books that they have read. Of all the roles, this role is often the most personal in its focus. Summarizer This role involves preparing a brief summary of the reading that was assigned for that day's meeting. The summary should include the main ideas or events to remember, major characters, symbols or other significant highlights of the passage. Good summarizers are important to literature circles, as they can help their peers see the overall picture (DaLie, 2001). Also include important events and details. Vocabulary enricher Also called the Word Master or Word Wizard, this role is to record important words for that day's reading. Words that are unusual, unknown, or that stand out in some way are usually chosen by the student. Their page number and definition is also recorded. Often students do not see this role as particularly stimulating; however, it can be a role suited to students who are still developing confidence in English classes or textual analysis. Travel tracer This role involves recording where the major shifts in action or location take place in the novel for the reading section. Keeping track of shifts in place, time, and characters helps students keep track of important shifts in the novel. Artistic students also are drawn to this role, as artwork can be incorporated into this role as well. The student's role is to describe each setting in detail, using words or maps that illustrate the action. Investigator This role includes investigative work where background information needs to be found on any topic relating to the book. Historical, geographical, cultural, musical or other information that would help readers connect to the novel is often researched and shared with the group. The research is informal in nature, providing small bits of information in order that others can better understand the novel. Figurative language finder This role includes identification of various types of figurative language, including but not limited to simile, metaphor, personification, hyperbole, and idiom. This may lead to discussion about the author's craft - why the author chose to use those particular words or phrases, and whether or not they were effective. This in-context identification can be more relevant and memorable than isolated instruction by the teacher of these types of tools. Assessment and evaluation Most teachers assess and evaluate what students do in Literature Circles. This may involve one or several of the following assessment(s) and evaluation(s): ; Self-assessment : Students should be involved in monitoring and recording their own level of response and engagement with their book and participation with their group as they meet each session. Often formal checklists are used for students to keep track of their progress. ; Peer assessment : Students can also be empowered to assess their fellow group members over the course of their book talks. As with self- assessment, checklists or other rubrics can provide structure. ; Observations : On-going teacher observation and active participation in group discussions is critical in assessing student progress both individually and in whole group. Daniels (1994) notes that most assessment should be formative, ensuring that students are provided with timely feedback to learn more effectively. Observations can meet such formative assessment criteria. ; Conferences : Face-to-face conversations between student and teacher can help to \\"access, track and monitor student growth\\" (Daniels, 1994, p. 160). ; Portfolios : Collections of student products, collected and assembled in a meaningful fashion, provide the opportunity for reflection, discussion, response to the book, and displaying a student's best work. Portfolios can take on many forms, ranging from writing, art, video/audiotapes, learning logs, student journals, personal responses etc. (Daniels, 1994). ; Extension projects : Extension projects can take the form of numerous creative and artistic student products, from book jackets to visual media or printed forms. Projects provide readers with \\"additional ways to revisit what they've read, continue the conversations (and the discoveries), and create even more meaning\\" (Schlick Noe & Johnson, 1999). More conversations about the books usually arise out of sharing of these projects with the group and the whole class. ; Student artifacts : Response logs, role sheets, and other process material that students have compiled over the course of the Literature Circle meetings can be also evaluated providing \\"a rich source of insight\\" (Daniels, 1994, p. 164) for the teacher to assess growth and progress of students. ; Wikis and blogs : Students may blog on a teacher created website. This blog will not only facilitate conversation, but implement technology. The blog will also give teachers a means by which to grade and assess the quality of student comprehension. Blogs enable students to share ideas, read class notes, and give feedback to the class.

The series also parodies the violent atmosphere of Chicago during the Dry Law, as well as the old American films, their heroes and villains. The main characters in this series are four friendly mice: Elliot \\"Mouse\\", Gordon, Mr. Wilson, and Jack the Irishman, although there are also some cats and dogs. Plot The citizens of \\"Cheesecago\\" are defenceless against \\"Al Catone's\\" mobsters until a few brave federal agents from the \\"Federal Mousehole of Investigation\\" headed by \\"Elliot Mouse\\" dare to take on the gangsters. In spite of their rivalry and continuous fights, they control gambling, shows, races and every business in town. They charge poor people and terrified traders with high taxes; they rob, and kidnap, but their biggest racket is in confiscating cheese and then deal with it illegally so that it fetches very high prices, often causing Cheesecago citizens to get ripped off.

The status of dasa sil matas is in between an ordinary upāsikā (laywoman) and a fully ordained bhikkhuni. They are usually expected to work in viharas, essentially as maids to ordained bhikkhus, rather than receiving training and the opportunity to practice. However, some dasa sil matas have struggled and managed to establish monasteries of their own, where women have the opportunity devote themselves to spiritual training and practice. In Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, they have established monasteries for anagārikās. Similar orders exist in Thailand, Cambodia and in Myanmar. In Thailand, where it is illegal for a woman to take a bhikkhuni ordination, they are called maechi. In Cambodia, they are called donchees. In Burma, an eight precept nun is addressed as thilashin or sayalay, whereas a fully ordained woman is called a rahan-ma (\\"female monk\\"). Sri Lanka's dasa sil matas are recognized by their shaven heads and yellow robes.

Dictionary of Labour Biography, London: Politicos, 2001, p.342-43 Lambeth Council Ted Knight was active in the Labour Party from a young age but was expelled from the Party in 1956 following a purge of the Trotskyist Socialist Labour League (SLL). Knight was re-admitted to the Norwood Constituency Labour Party in 1970, despite suspicions by some members that he retained his links with the proscribed SLL. In Norwood Labour Party Knight met Ken Livingstone, later Leader of the Greater London Council and Mayor of London, and the two formed an alliance to influence the selection of candidates in Norwood for the council elections in 1974. After that, they jostled for the leadership of the left within the Labour Group on Lambeth Borough Council but Livingstone's later move to Camden in North London left the way open for Knight to become the leading left-winger within the Labour Group and Leader of the Council. When the Conservative Government took powers through the Rates Act 1984 to limit the budgets of local councils, several left-wing Labour councils organised a rebellion in which they refused to set a budget. All the councils eventually backed down except Liverpool City Council and Lambeth. The district auditor found that the council had lost interest on tax payments as a result, which was held to be due to the \\"wilful misconduct\\" of Knight and 31 other councillors. Each was required to repay the amount of lost interest in a surcharge and banned from holding office for five years. The Labour Party's leader, Neil Kinnock, blamed local leaders like Ted Knight and Linda Bellos from Lambeth, for bringing the Labour Party into disrepute. Prior to the 1987 general election, Knight was a potential candidate for Coventry North East: a runner-up at the Constituency Labour Party selection meeting, he lost out to John Hughes. After Lambeth Knight took a break from politics after being expelled from office as a result of the Rate-capping rebellion. He pursued various business interests and remained treasurer of the town hall social club until it closed in 1994. He remained active within his union, Unite. Knight was elected to the National Committee of the Labour Representation Committee (2004) at their AGM on 17 November 2007. After the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party, Knight once again became active in Lambeth Labour, securing the post of Branch Chair in Gipsy Hill ward in November 2016. Knight died in March 2020.

Playing career A former forward, he played 206 times and scored 67 goals for Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga between 1977–1985. Abroad he played for FC Girondins de Bordeaux (1985–1986) and Stade Rennais FC (1986–1987). He appeared four times for West Germany, his most prominent participation was the one in the 1982 World Cup finals, where he scored the fourth goal in West Germany's 4–1 win over Chile in the first round. His only goal in his short national team career. In 1987, Reinders became player manager at Eintracht Braunschweig. Coaching career After retiring from playing, he continued his managerial career at then 2. Bundesliga side Eintracht Braunschweig in 1988–1989. After two seasons as manager with Braunschweig he departed from the club, taking over FC Hansa Rostock in East Germany's NOFV Oberliga Nordost, previously known as DDR-Oberliga. As East Germany's Deutscher Fußball-Verband was to finally merge into Deutscher Fußball Bund after that, the 1990–91 season worked out to be the factor for those former DDR-Oberliga clubs to enqueue into the German football league structure. Under Reinders guidance Rostock won the final edition of the East German Cup (against FC Stahl Eisenhüttenstadt) and also grabbed the NOFV Oberliga Nordost title, which meant the team qualified to start in the Bundesliga in the 1991–92 season. Enjoying a fantastic start to the 1991–92 season, Rostock's form slumped massively and, with the threat of relegation rising, let the club sack him on 6 March 1992. Just a month later he was back in charge of a Bundesliga outfit, successing Willibert Kremer at fellow relegation threatened MSV Duisburg. Reinders failed to avoid relegation with them. The begin of the then next season saw Reinders keep on at MSV, but on 21 October 1993, he left the Ruhr club to take charge of fellow 2. Bundesliga side Hertha BSC. A job in which he lasted only five months before the faced the sack. It took nearly eight years to enable him a return to management in the top division of German football. On 25 October 2002, Eintracht Braunschweig of 2. Bundesliga re-appointed Reinders as manager, he succeeded Peter Vollmann at the just re-promoted club. However, he could not keep Braunschweig up and was, following an uninspiring run through the lower Regionalliga Nord, sacked by them on 2 March 2004. Reinders' next jobs were 1. FC Pforzheim, and then Brinkumer SV, a club promoted to the fourth tier of German football, Oberliga Nord, at the start of the 2005–06 season. Yet, he was not for long their manager, he resigned from his role mid-way through their campaign at a time when the club was only second from bottom with just seven points in the bank.
