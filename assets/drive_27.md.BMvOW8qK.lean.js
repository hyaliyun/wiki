General Samovar's daughter Nadine is engaged to Nikolas Kromeski but is actually in love with Jacques Baccarel, an artist the General hates because of Jacques's avant-garde notions about painting.

Samovar is also unaware that his nephew Nikolas Kromeski, a Dutch coffee planter, has returned from Borneo and has brought his wife Pomare, a native girl from Borneo, with him.

The only problem is that the guide book is a fraud; Bramble has never visited Baluchistan and the book was actually written by a dead friend. Bramble's wife Josephine persuades him to write a book of his own. Bramble confides his secret to the journalist Paul Prince, and asks him to be a ghostwriter for his new book. However, the son of the dead friend arrives on the scene disguised as Schamyl from Baluchistan together with his lady-friend, Kadouja. Schamyl sees an opportunity for blackmail but before he can put his scheme into action falls in love with Bramble's daughter, Leonie, much to the annoyance of her fiancé, Benjy Cardigan. Cardigan suspects that Schamyl is a fraud and arranges a pageant of wild folkdancers from Baluchistan which exposes the fraudsters. ===Cast=== *Arthur Whitby - Napoleon Bramble *Maisie Gay - Josephine Bramble *Tom Walls - Paul Prince *Claude Cameron - Schamyl *Regine Flory - Kadouja *Moya Mannering - Leonie Bramble *Douglas McLaren - Benjy Cardigan *Jan Oyra - The Spirit of Hashish *Peggy Kurton, Jean Cadell, Evelyn Laye ===Songs=== *Give Me the Frocks *I Wish I was a Dog *The Flower That Never Dies *The Kiss You're Going to Get *Season *(Interpolated: Poor Butterfly) ==References== Category:1907 compositions Category:1909 musicals Category:Original musicals Category:American musicals Category:Broadway musicals Category:1917 musicals Category:1917 compositions Category:British musicals ","title":"The Beauty Spot"},{"id":"60379958","text":"Rodolfo Guerra (born 17 April 1942) is a Mexican wrestler.

He mainly created lead statues of which only a few have survived to modern times. ==Life and work== Dieussart may have been born in Rome (around 1630) and was the brother of the architect and sculptor Charles Philippe Dieussart. He first appears around 1664 in Stockholm (possibly coming from Germany), when he entered service with count Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, the Lord High Chancellor of Sweden, who was his main employer and patron until around 1668. Coming to Sweden, he was accompanied by his wife (who died in Stockholm in 1668) and his stepchildren, including Abraham-César Lamoureux and his brother Claude, who were both sculptors, as well as their sister Magdalena, who later married the sculptor Johann Gustav Stockenberg. While Dieussart was a Baroque sculptor and one of the first representatives a free-standing style of sculpture in Sweden (some consider him Sweden's first modern sculptor), his work has been described as examples of a renaissance-like pseudo-classicism. His work consists mainly of statues, for which he used different materials, although the majority of his known works were made from lead or gilded lead. Possibly due to metal fatigue caused by the softness of the material, however, few of Dieussart's works survive. For Läckö Castle he is known to have created busts of various members of the De la Gardie family and is also believed to be the creator of two full sized statues of Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie and his father Jakob (originally created for Karlberg Palace, where Dieussart also created decorative sculptures for the palace gardens) that were later moved there. To decorate another palace owned by the De la Gardie family, namely Makalös palace, Dieussart created several lead statues, including a lead replica of a classical Diana statue. Probably assisted by his stepsons he created several sculptures to decorate the gardens and fountains of Jakobsdal (now Ulriksdal) Palace. In 1667 he was contracted by De la Gardie to create a number of lead sculptures for the roof of the Riddarhuset (which was completed by the architect Jean de la Vallée between 1660 and 1674), which he delivered in 1668, and he was commissioned to complete the northern and southern portals of the building that had been begun by , which he was still working on in 1669. His stepson Abraham-César replaced him as sculptor in De la Gardie's service between 1671 and 1672 and Dieussart is believed to have stayed in Sweden until around 1672, probably employed in his stepson's workshop, but then may have moved back to the Netherlands, appearing again in Swedish records in 1677, and returning to the Swedish mainland around 1679, probably returning to De la Gardie's service. What became of him after 1680 is unknown, as are the date and place of his death. ==Most important works== * Lead statues \\"Amor Dei\\" and \\"Amor Patriae\\" on the roof of the Riddarhuset. * Garden sculpture group \\"Perseus and Andromeda\\" in the park of Jakobsdal Palace (no longer existing). { -  File:Andromedaklippan Ulriksdal 1664.jpgDrawing of Andromeda Cliff (Swedish: Andromedaklippan) in Ulriksdal Palace park (c. 1664) for Erik Dahlberg's Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna File:Andromedaklippan Ulriksdal 2012.jpgAndromeda Cliff feature (remains) in Ulriksdal Palace park } ===Attributed works=== * Lead statues of Magnus Gabriel and Jakob De la Gardie, originally made for Karlberg Palace, then moved to Läckö Castle, but later relocated to the De la Gardie family mausoleum in Varnhem Abbey. { -  File:Varnhems klosterkyrka - KMB - 16000200171148.jpgStatue of Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie in Varnhem Abbey (detail) File:Varnhems klosterkyrka - KMB - 16000200171147.jpgStatue of Jakob De la Gardie in Varnhem Abbey (detail) } ==Literature== * * ==Notes== ==References== Category:1630s births Category:17th-century sculptors Category:Swedish sculptors Category:Flemish Baroque sculptors Category:Year of death unknown ","title":"Jean Baptiste Dieussart"},{"id":"60380049","text":"Jorge Hugo Rojas Justiniano (born 6 December 1993) is a Bolivian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Always Ready. ==International career== Rojas made his senior debut for the Bolivia national football team in a 2-2 friendly tie with Nicaragua on 3 March 2019. ==ReferencesCategory:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Santa Cruz de la Sierra Category:Bolivian footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Sport Boys Warnes players Category:Club Always Ready players Category:Bolivian Primera División players Category:Bolivia international footballers ","title":"Jorge Rojas (Bolivian footballer)"},{"id":"60380058","text":"Alexis Wilkinson (born 1992) is an American writer best known as the first African American president of The Harvard Lampoon.

It derives its name from its requirement that employees work from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm, 6 days per week; i.e. 72 hours per week. A number of Chinese internet companies have adopted this system as their official work schedule. Critics argue that the 996 working hour system is a flagrant violation of Chinese law. In March 2019 an \\"anti-996\\" protest was launched via GitHub. == Background == The culture of overtime work has a long history in Chinese IT companies, where the focus is typically on speed and cost reduction. Companies employ a range of measures, such as reimbursing taxi fares for employees who remain working at the office late into the night, to encourage overtime work. === Relevant legislation === The Labour Law of the People's Republic of China states: > Chapter 4 Article 36 The State shall practise a working hour system wherein > labourers shall work for no more than eight hours a day and no more than 44 > hours a week on the average. Article 41 The employer can prolong work hours > due to needs of production or businesses after consultation with its trade > union and labourers.

The company responded that the 996 system would be an encouraged, not compulsory, practice. === JD.com === After 58.com's 996 schedule was made known to the public, an internal email from the vice- president Gang He () of JD.com was leaked online, which contained a demand for the management team of JD.com to implement the 996 working hour system \\"on a flexible basis.\\" On , an employee of JD.com alleged that some departments have begun implementing the 995 schedule (9am-9pm, but 5 days per week), while other departments have already finished doing so. Following the report, the public relations department of JD.com announced that overtime work was not compulsory. Richard Liu, the founder of the company, referred to people complaining about the work schedule as \\"slackers\\". === Youzan === On , the social platform Maimai showed an employee from Youzan stating that their supervisor had enforced the 996 schedule. Bai Ya, the CEO of Youzan, replied, \\"it would be a good thing to look back at a few years later.\\" Some media criticized this schedule. On the afternoon of , the Labour Supervision Group of Xihu District, Hangzhou announced that the company was under investigation. === Others === At least 40 companies, including Huawei and Alibaba Group, have implemented the 996 schedule or an even more intensive alternative. == Online protests == === 996.ICU GitHub campaign === logo of Anti-996 GitHub project On , the 996.ICU repository and website were created. The repository states that the name \\"996.icu\\" refers to how developers who work under the 996 system (9AM–9PM, 6 days per week) would risk poor health and a possible stay in an intensive care unit. The movement's slogan is \\"developers' lives matter\\". Two days later, on , the repository had already received 50 thousand stars, and 100 thousand stars on , which made it the top trending repository on GitHub. The repository reached 120 thousand stars on , and 200 thousand stars on 9 April 2019, making it the second most starred repository on GitHub. The flurry of activity led to the \\"issue\\" page of the repository to be flooded with spam and shut down, which was hotly discussed on Zhihu, Sina Weibo, and WeChat. The original aim of the repository was to list the companies that use the 996 working hour system, but soon developed into a movement - the - to explicitly prohibit companies using the 996 system from using open source code on GitHub. ==== Browser blacklist ==== On , it was widely reported that QQ Browser and WeChat (products of Tencent), UC Browser (product of Alibaba), 360 Browser (product of Qihoo 360) and many of other Chromium-based Chinese browsers blocked the 996.icu repository on GitHub, describing it as \\"an illegal and fraudulent site.\\" ==== Support by Microsoft employees ==== On , employees at Microsoft and GitHub created a GitHub repository named \\"support.996.ICU\\" in support of the 996.ICU campaign, which they believe could be under threat of Chinese government censorship. == Positions == === Support === * Jack Ma has stated that workers should consider 996 \\"a huge blessing\\" to \\"achieve the success [one] want[s] without paying extra effort and time.\\" * Richard Liu, founder of JD.com: \\"Slackers are not my brothers!\\" === Oppose === * of Xinhua News Agency: \\"The 996 working hour system breaks the labour law.

The influx of these immigrants can largely be attributed to a single mill and millworker complex, the Germania Woolen Mills, which formed the basis of the immigrant colony (, \\"the German immigrant colony from Holyoke\\") that would make the ward encompassing the South Holyoke neighborhood that with the highest German population per capita, in all of New England by 1875. Along with unionization efforts by the Irish community, Germans would also play a key role in the city and region's socialist labor movements as workers organized for higher pay and improved living conditions in the textile and paper mill economies. Reflecting anti-German sentiment in the United States nationwide, as well as the concurrent decline of the Holyoke economy, much of the community dispersed or became Americanized following the World Wars in the 20th century; as of 2010, residents of German ancestry represented 4.7% or 1,887 of Holyoke's residents, and 6.0% or 27,526 residents in Hampden County. With the exception of a handful of restaurants and institutions in the Greater Springfield area, the influence of German culture in the city remains largely relegated to historical accounts today. Following this decline in the 1940s through 1970s, much of the Germania area of South Holyoke was razed or entirely redeveloped, with some exceptions such as the Turner Hall. Other institutions like the Sons of Hermann and Heinritz's Drug Store have been preserved and repurposed as a church and cultural center respectively, for the generation of Puerto Rican immigrants who began settling there in the mid-20th century. ==History== ===Early immigration, establishment of the Germania Mills=== In its earliest days, Holyoke, though an ambitious project, was hardly an ensured economic success. Until new industrial orders came in the American Civil War, the Panic of 1857 had decimated the industrial economy of the nation on the whole, and Holyoke was not an exception. In this same time news of the planned industrial city had reached Germany, a country that had heard of the previous success of the Boston Associates' work in Lowell, and one which had seen a substantial loss due to the economic downturn of the American economy. One particular town in Rhineland, Lennep, a center of woolen textiles, was to a certain degree able to endure the severe global recession by choosing to set up sales agencies directly in the United States rather than going through agents in Hamburg as many others had. This was largely due to the foresight of the Stursberg family whose patriarch, Wilhelm Stursberg, had first begun production in 1789 in neighboring Beyenburg (DE) and maintained his offices, home, and a number of village institutions in Lennep. In time one of his grandsons, a Hermann Stursberg, had been able to set up a successful sales office of woolen goods in New York City. Currency fluctuations in the United States from the Civil War however led to severe losses, and ultimately it was decided by the family it would be expedient to no longer rely on imports, but rather set up a mill overseas. On January 19, 1865, August Stursberg would purchase a woolen mill in South Holyoke that had opened two years prior, renaming it \\"Germania Mill\\", as it was to be known for nearly the next 100 years. He would embark to America with his family and a team of skilled workers and supervisors on September 16, 1865, aboard the S.S. Allamania. August would play a substantial role in the emerging community both in the shaping of this industry but also in the accompanying cultural institutions that would support it. A devout Lutheran, he was credited with bringing in the German-language Lutheran ministers who first preached in a schoolhouse at the corner of Sargeant and Clemente (Park) Streets in 1866, and was a significant benefactor in the building of the first permanent home of the German Lutheran Church, now known as the First Lutheran Church, established in 1867. One historical account by the Holyoke Transcript notes that the church in its earliest years was a product of several other denominations, having been aided by local Congregationalists and served by two Presbyterian ministers, Pastor Schwartz and Pastor Frankel, the former of which also taught German classes in Holyoke. For the first several years the official denomination of the church was met with fervent debate, and it remained the only major German institution outside of Germania Mills, while still being strongly influenced by the Stursbergs. Although the Jewish community would later be characterized by immigrants predominantly from Vilna, Lithuania, the city's first Hebrew families would also arrive from Germany around the same time as the Lutheran community, with five such families living in Holyoke by 1890; among the early settlers were the names Adler, Cole, King, and Marks. For the better part of the first half of the twentieth century, the Jewish center of the city remained in South Holyoke alongside the German community, as the long-since demolished first synagogue of Congregation Rodphey Sholem was built there on Park/Clemente Street in 1904. Seeking to create a Turnen Verein (Gymnastics Society) as a community space outside of church, about twenty members of the German community met at the butchery of one Robert Schubert on the evening of May 28, 1871, laying the groundwork for such an organization. Historian Gerhard Wiesinger notes in his account on Holyoke's Germans that this may have been prompted by anticipation of community growth, as the meeting occurred only two weeks after the Treaty of Frankfurt. At the first official meeting of the organization on June 8, at Schubert's house and garden, officers were elected and the motions were made to formally incorporate the Holyoke Turn Verein as an organization \\"in order to provide the German language, German customs and traditions, and particularly German gymnastics with a permanent home\\". Over the next several years the group would meet at various member's homes, as well as at the Germania Hotel which stood at the corner of Race and Hamilton Streets. In 1874 the Turn Verein purchased land from the Holyoke Water Power Company and built the beginnings of the Turn Hall still on South Bridge Street today. Part of the impetus for this were blue laws against Sunday activities, including exercise, in public.HLY.46, Massachusetts Cultural Resource Information System (MACRIS), Massachusetts Historical Commission The turnhall would expand its hall in 1893, also purchasing several tracts of land adjacent to the original building for a biergarten and for outdoor gymnastic exercises. ===Second wave of immigration=== More German workers would arrive in the subsequent decade, predominantly from Saxony, with such immigration reaching a peak in 1881. With this new wave of immigrant workers, came new attitudes both about culture and politics, introducing a socialist-union element to Holyoke politics. In time an Irish-German political alliance had formed under one Henry Winkler, however this machine would fail after supporting 1891 Mayor Michael J. Griffin, who had in time gained a reputation for corruption. Even still in the 1880s, more than a place of refreshment, the turnhall had become venue for the political class, with candidates for mayor attending gymnastics events there and at least one French-Canadian \\"Candidate [for City Clerk] Genest acted like a native of the Fatherland\\" there. A number of greater festivals would be held there as well, including a turnfest hosted by the Springdale Turner Vorwaerts featuring 1,200 gymnasts from more than 30 clubs on the east coast in 1899. Such turnfests typically included many events known to modern track and field, such as shot-put, high jump, and broad jump. In 1916 the Holyoke Turnhall would similarly take part in the Hartford Bezirksturnfest, coming in first overall, before concluding the event singing a series of songs including several American patriotic tunes and Deutschlandlied, at that time not yet the German national anthem. Similarly in 1938 the Holyoke Turnerverein hosted the New England Turnfest, which brought 10 other Turner teams and more than 2000 people to Camp Jahn in Southampton, Massachusetts. Another example of German cultural events in Holyoke came with the \\"Schiller Festival\\" at the Holyoke Opera House to celebrate noted German poet Friedrich Schiller's work. On May 14, 1905 a number of members of the Western Massachusetts and Connecticut German communities descended on the venue to listen to dramatic readings of the poet's work as well as accompanying music furnished by the Springfield orchestral club. Proceeds of the event, organized by Jacques Wisly, then- publisher of the New England Rundschau and his editor Otto J. Miller, benefited the Holyoke City Hospital at the time. The German community would also bring with it a number of musical acts; indeed a plurality of orchestras in the Springfield-Holyoke area were established and led by German immigrants in the late 19th century and early 20th century including, but not limited to, examples such as Weizel's, Wildner's, and Wagner's orchestras. ===Decline and contemporary history=== Germania Mills would become another economic casualty of the Great Depression when in 1934 the mills closed. That same year the company would drop the name Germania and adopt that of its former Livingston Worsted Division, which it moved from Washington, Rhode Island to Holyoke. Previously the division handled the weaving and finishing of the fiber spun at the Holyoke mill, following its closure the company moved entirely to the former. Livingston Worsted mills would continue manufacturing fabric for a number of clothing firms including Hickey Freeman, but on August 28, 1964, J. Herman Stursberg, descendant of the founders, would announce the company's closure just short of its 100th anniversary. Speaking with the press Stursberg would attribute the move to economics, saying the worsted mills could not compete with Japanese imports as 50% of overhead costs for the mill went into wages significantly higher than foreign counterparts. Similarly to the redevelopment of the Polish community in the downtown area, the German blocks of South Holyoke abutting Germania Park were entirely razed beyond recognition through fires and urban renewal initiatives in the mid-20th century. Of the original Germania Mills complex, only two of the \\"Battleship Block\\" apartment buildings remain, with no other worker housing buildings or residences of any kind extant in the immediate vicinity. Germania Park and the so-named worker housing on the opposite side of Clemente Street were considered as being combined into a larger park as early as 1944, however the plan to remove the road and raze these structures was still under discussion for an urban renewal project by 1956. By August 1956, the local landmark had been badly damaged in a case of arson which razed one of its units; the unoccupied rowhouses had been reportedly plagued by a series of smaller fires as well, attributed to children who would break into the vacant units on weekday evenings. By 1957 the blocks had been razed and with the abutting street had been converted to a parking lot. New trees were planted in the Germania Park, and by some point in 1982 the street had been incorporated into the park, then called Germania Bonin Field. Among the wave of immigrants who had immigrated from Saxony were a handful of bakers who would go on to establish regionally successful companies or affiliates in the 20th century. One of the first among these was Richard H. Dietz. Arriving from Saxony in 1881, he established his bakery at the corner of Clemente and Jackson Streets, moving his business, Dietz Bakery, several times to larger facilities in the subsequent decades before it removed to Springfield in 1910. He would leave the business when his company merged with the Massachusetts Baking Company in 1918 which, that same year, was bought by what would become the Continental Baking Company. Dietz's competitors included one Otto Dreikorn, who also arrived from Saxony in the 1880s, establishing Dreikorn's Bakery in 1889. The business would gradually expand under both his leadership and his son, Otto M. Dreikorn, who assumed the family business after his father died in a car accident in 1911. Gradually over the 20th century the company would greatly expand, assuming a larger commercial model under James Dreikorn sometime after 1928, who expanded delivery to multiple supermarkets and outlets. In time the company became a household name in the region, marketing its breads in distinct orange labels as \\"untouched by human hands\\". With a changing consumer market in the latter decades of the 20th century, the company would attempt to promote new products other than its sliced enriched white bread, including honey wheat bread, * however the bakery would sell its recipes and right to distribution to Stroehmann and finally cease production in late 1987, although signage has been kept up at its former Holyoke factory as recently as 2019, commemorating the role of the former business. At the time of its closure it had two other office facilities in Adams and Newington, Connecticut. Another notable business of the community which shaped commerce in the area was Steiger's. Established as a clothing and dry goods store in 1896 by Albert Steiger, who had emigrated to the United States from Baden-Württemberg as a child in 1868, by 1899 the store had moved into what was then the first department store in Holyoke at that time. By the time of its acquisition and liquidation by The May Department Stores Company in 1994, the store had grown into a regional chain with a large flagship store in Metro Center, Springfield. ==Institutions== While not as prominent as the Turnhall in its influence, one of the societies that played a significant role in German life in Holyoke was its local Sons of Hermann lodge, the first established in Massachusetts out of an eventual 22, Teutonia Lodge No. 1, ODHS. Founded on November 18, 1889, the benefit society promoted dance and drink among members, as well as mutual insurance. It appears in its formative years the organization held meetings at the Turnhall among other places, and may have for a time considered becoming a part of the German Order of Harugari or that group may have existed in Holyoke with a lodge of the same name separately. Eventually, with a membership of 175, opened its own meeting hall in 1912 designed by George P. B. Alderman. Equipped with a rathskeller, cafe, and auditorium hall seating 500, the hall would host many other groups over the years, predominantly unions, labor organizations, and civic groups like the Holyoke Fire Department. The club would remain a keystone of both the city community, being honored multiple times by city mayors, as well as the German community across the state, hosting members and leadership from other communities into the mid-20th century. At some point in the organization's earlier history it also established the Thusnelda lodge, a ladies auxiliary named after Hermann's wife. By the end of the organizations existence, one of its charter members, Otto Broeker, had remained with it for its entirety before passing away at the age of 98 in 1965. While the exact date of the society's folding is unknown, by 1968 a bar known as the \\"Sons of Hermann Club\\" was being operated out of the building by a single family, and by 1976 an obituary of a former member referred to it as \\"the former Teutonia Lodge\\". In one of the earliest examples of reuse of South Holyoke's buildings, the meeting house was renovated in 1973 by the New Hope Church of God in Christ, today known as the Dr. Elouise Franklin Church. A number of smaller organizations, like the German-Austria Sick Benefit Society, and the German-American Social Club of Holyoke, would appear in the early 20th century, but few endured as long or in as many accounts of history as the Turnhall and the Sons of Hermann. One exception to this was the Springdale Vorwaerts Turn Verein, which broke off of its South Holyoke counterpart and formed in 1886 with 34 members citing substantial differences regarding politics after a textile labor strike orchestrated by them which had failed. ===Newspapers and publishers=== { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-right: 1em; margin-left: 0em; margin-bottom: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:fit-content; max-width: 20%;\\" cellspacing=\\"3\\"  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align: center;font- weight:bold;background-color:#bbd0ec;\\"  German-Language Newspapers of Holyoke -  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  Holyoke Journal (1883–1889)[a] -  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  Der Beobachter (1883–1889)[a] -  style=\\"text- align: center;\\"  Zeitgeist () -  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  Neu England Rundschau (1889–1942) -  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  Connecticut Staats- Zeitung (1890–1942) -  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  Die Biene (1894–) -  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  Teutonia (1907–) -  style=\\"text-align: center;\\"  Missouri Lutherische Liga Bote (unkn) -  style=\\"text-align: center;border-top:1px solid black;\\"  [a]Merged into Neu England Rundschau - }The Neu England Rundschau or \\"New England Review\\", originally called the Holyoke Journal, it was the first and longest running German-language weekly published in Holyoke from 1884 to sometime around 1942; its parent business, the Hitchcock Press, remains extant in the city as of 2019 Throughout the late 19th and early 20th century, Holyoke would serve as a publishing center for the German language, having more newspapers and similar serial publications in the German language published there from its founding through the 1950s than any other New England city besides Boston. This was attributable to a handful of printing tradesmen in South Holyoke and Springdale, whose business eventually morphed into some of the English- language presses still extant there today. Mistakenly cited as the first German newspaper of the city by some accounts, Die Biene (\\"The Bee\\"), was a weekly published by Saxony emigrant August Lehmann; beginning publication in 1894, and continuing until shortly after Lehmann's death in 1917, as late as 1918 or 1920. During his life Lehmann would serve as an advocate for the Union Labor movement, and by the time of his death the paper was listed as the only Labor newspaper published in German in New England, along with his second publication Springfield Vorwaert (\\"Springfield Forward\\"). From about 1907 to 1918 Lehmann would also publish The Teutonia, a German monthly by the Sons of Hermann with a circulation of about 2500. Lehmann's Publishing House, as its Main Street storefront appeared, prior to its closure, c. 1922 For a time Lehmann also served as the manager of The German American Publishing Company, another local interest founded in 1883 or 1884, which carried his papers in some capacity during their publication. The German-American Publishing Company, known as the German-American Printing Company after 1888, would publish the longest-running German newspaper in Holyoke. Begun in 1883 as the Holyoke Journal, initiall a reprint of the Boston-based New-England Staaten- Zeitung, under the leadership of the William Thieme the German weekly would merge with the smaller Der Beobachter and be rechristened the Neu England Rundschau or \\"New England Review\\" in 1889, a name it would keep throughout the remainder of its history. Thieme would retire in 1893 and by 1900 the paper was owned by one Jacques Wisly, whose descendants would continue to operate it with news local and international until folding in the latter half of 1942. The end of its publication was attributed to economics, however, the influence of anti-German sentiment cannot be discounted, as in a syndicated column entitled \\"German Papers Here Spread Poison\\" 20 years prior, the paper was among those named as spreading anti-Patriotic writing, without given context, that \\"Germany [was] more democratic than the United States\\". By the end of its publication the paper had a circulation of 4,000, down from a peak of 5,200 in 1910. At the same time the German-American Printing Co. ceased publication of its other longterm work printing the Connecticut Staats-Zeitung, an independent weekly that had been published in Holyoke as well as a number of other presses in Connecticut. Wisly would remain involved in the company well into the 20th century and would rename it The Wisly Lithograph and Printing Company by 1921, and by 1934 Jacques Wisly's son Victor Wisly and daughter Regina Brooks had taken over the press, renaming it the Wisly-Brooks Company. While the German paper ceased publication by the end of World War II, its parent company remained; in 1956 the company would be purchased by one David Kornetsky and renamed the Hitchcock Press after its original location on Hitchcock Street. In 1971 it was purchased by a J. Guy Gaulin, who chose to specialize the business as a letterpress printer despite changing technological trends in the industry; the company remains extant in this business today under the management of his daughter Deanna Gaulin. ==International relations== thumb150pxleftHolyoke \\"Hercules\\" turbine; its improvements on efficiency were followed closely in Germany at the time * * The turbulent history of the German Empire, Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, and its splitting thereafter would prevent the city from maintaining any relationship with the German state in the way it had with Ireland, Canada, and France, however the city would have several exchanges with Germany in technology. Although Germania Mill employed 75% of all Germans in Holyoke at one time, the textile business was not the sole exchange between Holyoke and German industrialists at that time. As the Holyoke Water Power Company continued work developing improved turbines at its testing flume, the German engineering community kept abreast with its research and developments such as the \\"Holyoke Hercules\\" turbine, A prominent example of technical exchange between Holyoke and German counterparts is also found in the history of railway engineering. A young Worcester Polytechnic graduate, George E. Pellissier, convinced the Holyoke Street Railway to serve as the first American customer of the Goldschmidt Thermit Company, making the railway the first in the Americas to lay track, with work commencing on August 8, 1904, using the thermite welding process, a standard operating procedure among railroads today. Pellissier would go on to work for both the Holyoke Street Railway Company, and was also hired for a time by Hans Goldschmidt to further improve continuous welded rail processes and design one of their earliest plants in Jersey City. During World War II, the city would take in three German refugees fleeing from Nazi persecution, three young men who would enter job training with 70 American counterparts with living costs supported by private New York beneficiaries. One of Holyoke's photographers, Ray D'Addario, who would spend much of his life in the city, would also serve as the chief US Army photographer of the Nuremberg trials. In contrast, while spending his final days living with his son Professor of History Peter Viereck in South Hadley, poet and Nazi propagandist George S. Viereck relocated to the area after serving a Federal sentence, for failing to register as a Nazi agent. Though he died in Holyoke on March 18, 1962, there are no records of Viereck having any involvement in the local community. ==Legacy== The First Lutheran Church at its current location in Oakdale today Today much of the German legacy of Holyoke lies in its buildings and historical accounts. Relatively few institutions related to the culture remain, however of the two turnhalls built by German immigrants more than a century ago, both still stand and while Springdale Turnverein would shutter by 2011, the Holyoke Turners remain active as of 2019, accepting people of any race or heritage to take part in membership and offering food, drink, candlepin bowling, and their gymnasium to this day. Several prominent structures commissioned by former German residents of Holyoke remain as examples of the city's 19th and 20th century architecture. Among them is the Gauthier Block (also known as Wayfinders Dwight/Clinton), the Heinritz Pharmacy, used today by the Nueva Esperanza organization, and Heinritz's house in Elmwood which, with its prominent tower, remains unique among residential structures in Elmwood. Although the textile industry no longer endures in Holyoke's economy, at least two multinationals tie the city to Germany in an economic capacity. Established in 1984, RuWac USA manufactures industrial vacuum systems such as explosion proof vacuums and immersion separators; although functionally independent, designing and manufacturing at its own facilities for the American market, it is the North American partner of Ruwac Industriesauger GmbH, a German industrial manufacturer of the same type of products. Additionally Stiebel Eltron, formerly maintaining its American headquarters in the city into the 21st century, still retains a small presence as a property owner, constructing apartment complexes that demonstrate their hardware products as case studies. Though not in Holyoke proper, a handful of German-Bavarian restaurants still serve the Greater Springfield region, including The Student Prince & The Fort Restaurant in Springfield, established in 1935, it maintains a large stein collection and features stained glass of local landmarks; faced with bankruptcy in 2014, it was purchased by Peter Picknelly of Peter Pan Bus Lines who kept on longtime owner Rudi Scherf. From 1935 until 2018, there was also a Hofbrauhaus of West Springfield, which maintained its own biergarten in a traditional German decor, however following a long decline in business it closed in April 2018. In 2004, the Munich Haus Restaurant was opened in Chicopee, by Patrick and Hubert Gottschlicht, seeking to establish a restaurant with authentic Bavarian cuisine, today the location maintains traditional German-made beer and fare as well as a biergarten. While its second house of worship overlooking Germania Park would be demolished before 1971, the First Lutheran Church would find a new home in Oakdale, breaking ground for its location of Northampton Street in 1955, which it still occupies today. While Orthodox Jewish Americans of German origin comprised the minority of the community by this time, similarly they would move from their locale in South Holyoke to the plot adjacent to the Lutheran Church two years earlier, in 1953. In the 1980s and early 1990s the history of the social factors, labor movements in the Turn Hall, and the 2nd and 3rd generations' embrace of American culture like baseball were well documented by one Gerhard Weisinger, whose 350-page treatise in German on the community Die deutsche Einwandererkolonie von Holyoke, Massachusetts, 1865-1920 describes and examines this community's history further in multifaceted detail. ==See also== * History of the French in Holyoke § Alsatians and Lorrainians * The Student Prince (restaurant), historical German restaurant in Springfield, Massachusetts ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * American Turners :* Holyoke Turn Hall, Facebook * First Lutheran Church of Holyoke * Neu England Rundschau issue for May 15, 1942 * 25 Jæhriges Stiftungsfest Des Holyoke Schuetzenbund, February 9, 1914 * Jacob Schutthelm Resources, documenting German resident Jacob Schutthelm's records as a considered \\"enemy alien\\" by the US Government during WWII * Shoeshine boy and companions in front of the fire station, 450 Main Street, photo from the Milan P.

Bennett was invited by the Duke of Newcastle to sit as Member of Parliament for Nottinghamshire as a stop-gap, keeping the seat warm for Lord Howe who had been appointed Governor of Barbados. Bennett was chosen because of his close friendship with the Duke of Kingston. He was returned unopposed at a by- election on 30 May 1732 under a compromise agreement with the local Tories. He consistently supported the Government, voting for the excise bill. In 1733 he tried, on Newcastle's behalf, to persuade the Duke of Kingston to accept a place as Lord of the bedchamber. However, the Duke's aunt, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu was particularly set against her nephew being brought to court, particularly as a tool of the Duke of Newcastle, and castigated him for his support of Bennett. Bennett was returned unopposed again for Nottinghamshire at the 1734 British general election, despite some local discontent because he was a Leicestershire man.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a “Mountain Treasure”. Named after a spur extending off the main ridge of Potts Mountain, the area is popular with hunters, hikers, and anglers. Near the point where Potts Arm merges with Potts Mountain, there are good views in winter of Catawba Mountain. The area is part of the Barbours Creek-Shawvers Run Cluster. ==Location and access== The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia, about 26 miles southwest of Covington, Virginia. Forest Road 604.1 is on the southeast; Potts Jeep Road, Forest Road 177.1, is on the east; and Sweet Springs Turnpike, Forest Road 176. is on the north and east. Forest Road 176 is between the area and the Barbours Creek Wilderness There are two designated trails in the area. *Potts Arm, Forest Trail, 3.9 miles *Potts Cove Trail, 1.67 miles Cove Road, Forest Road 275, gives access to Potts Cove. Boundary of the Potts Arm wildarea as identified by the Wilderness SocietyThe boundary of the wildland, as determined by the Wilderness Society, is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 788 (Covington, Alleghany Highlands). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Potts Arm wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps New Castle and Potts Creek. ==Natural history== The area is within the Ridge and Valley Subsection of the Northern Ridge and Valley Section in the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province. Potts Cove, in the center of the area, has been designated a “Rare Communitiy”. It has some 140-year-old stands of old growth forest. ==Topography== Potts Arm , a 3282 -foot-high spur off the main ridge of Potts Mountain, is the highest elevation in the area. Cove Branch, Wright Branch and Cold Spring Branch drain into Barbours Creek, a tributary of Craig Creek which is part of the James River watershed. ==Forest Service management== The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provides some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Potts Arm was not inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore not protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. Most of the area is managed as “Dispersed Recreation Area – Unsuitable” which allows some commercial logging but not regular timber production. Areas along Peaceful Valley East Road on the south and Sweet Springs Turnpike on the east are designated “Mix of Successional Habitats.” There is an area designated “Indiana Bat-Secondary Habitat” on the western end.”. ==See also== Barbours Creek-Shawvers Run Cluster ==References== ==Further reading== * Stephenson, Steven L., A Natural History of the Central Appalachians, 2013, West Virginia University Press, West Virginia, . * Davis, Donald Edward, Where There Are Mountains, An Environmental History of the Southern Appalachians, 2000, University of Georgia Press, Athens, Georgia. . ==External links== * George Washington and Jefferson National Forest * Wilderness Society Category:George Washington and Jefferson National Forests Category:Southwest Virginia Category:Protected areas of the Appalachians Category:Mountains of Virginia ","title":"Potts Arm"},{"id":"60380473","text":"Farewell to Dream (aka, Clouds at Twilight 夕やけ雲 Yūyake-gumo) is a 1956 Japanese film directed by Keisuke Kinoshita.

It is framed by scenes at the beginning and end of the movie in which the protagonist, Yoishi, is shown at 20 years old looks out into the distance and muses about how his dreams of becoming a sailor will never come true. The bulk of the film shows events from when Yoichi was about 16.

Other disappointments Yoichi faces include his best friend moving away, and his imagined romance with a woman he views from his room via binoculars never coming to fruition. Michael Kienzl comments that \\"Kinoshita relies less on emotional outbursts than on quiet touching moments.\\" He gives as an example the farewell scene between Yoichi and his best friend, in which the tragedy of their parting is conveyed through close ups of their touching feet and a long handshake. Turner Classic Movies' Rob Nixon draws attention to the beginning framing scene, in which Yoichi's being hemmed in by his circumstances is reflected in the mise en scene which shows Yoichi in a narrow frame between two buildings.

Allen. She received the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese Medal Award for 1947-48. She graduated as a valedictorian from Dunbar High School, part of the Dayton Public School System, in 1950. Bolds was the inaugural recipient of the Delta Sigma Theta Debutante Scholarship. She studied physics at Central State College, earning a degree in physics magna cum laude in 1954. She was typically the only woman in her physics classes. Soon after graduating she was hired by the Wright- Patterson Air Force Base. The United States Air Force supported her to study computer science at the University of Dayton and management at Simmons University. == Research and career == Phyllis Bolds at work in the Radar Branch, Air Research Lab, in 1955 Bolds started work in 1955 as a physicist on the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in the Electronics Technology Laboratory, radar branch. She transferred to the Flight Dynamics Laboratory in 1957. At the time, a challenge in the design and use of aircraft was the lack of information about the dynamic operating environments. Bolds provided technical administration on a 1966-68 project that investigated how to predict the vibration environments of future aircraft using data collected from past aircraft.Piersol, A. G., & Van der Laan, W. F. (1968). Statistical Analysis of Flight Vibration and Acoustic Data (No. MAC-616-05). Measurement Analysis Corp, Los Angeles, CA. She collected aircraft vibration data on the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit, McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and Douglas C-133 Cargomaster, using test flights to collect information about the vibration environments that exist around vehicles during normal flight conditions. As so much data was collected, processing techniques such as spectrum analyzers and minicomputers were used. Bolds's spectral analysis of aircraft vibration and noise was called \\"substantial\\" and \\"instrumental\\" in suggesting ways to correct the adverse effects of the severe aeroacoustic environment created by operating high performance aircraft with their weapons bay doors open.Kaufman, I. I., Louis, G., Maciulaitis, A., & Clark, R. L. (1983). Mach 0.6 to 3.0 flows over rectangular cavities (No. AFWAL-TR-82-3112). Air Force Wright Aeronautical Labs, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. Her work on helicopter vibration frequencies helped to demonstrate that the Helicopter Vibration Test Curve \\"M\\" in use in 1970 was inadequate, potentially allowing for many instances of field equipment failure. In 1970 Bolds attended a symposium at the United States Air Force Academy where she was the only woman of 350 delegates. She published regular reports from the vibration and aeroelastic facilities. In 1979, she was awarded an Air Force Systems Command Certificate of Merit for her work. She worked for the United States Air Force for over thirty years, including fifteen years working on the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit \\"stealth\\" bomber, and was celebrated by the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base as a Hidden Figure. She was inducted into the Dunbar High School Wall of Fame in 2017. Bolds died on November 9, 2018. In 2019, she was one of the honorees in the \\"Dayton Skyscrapers\\" exhibit, presented by the Victoria Theatre Association and Shango: Center for The Study of African-American Art and Culture. == Personal life == Bolds met her husband Elmer Graham Bolds at the Central State University. Bolds' daughter, Karen Beason, and son, Keith Bolds, both worked for the United States Air Force. Her granddaughter, Adrienne Ephrem, also studied engineering and works in the 711th Human Performance Wing.

He is the senator representing Delta North senatorial district in the Nigerian Senate. He is a senator of the 8th and 9th National Assembly. He was sacked shorty after being announced senator elect during the 2019 general elections by a Federal High Court in Abuja as Senator-elect on allegations that he was not validly elected by his political party. The Appeal Court in Abuja however upturned the decision on 30 May 2019. The lead judge held that the Federal High Court that nullified his election had no jurisdiction over the case. == Personal life and education == Peter Nwaoboshi was born in 1958 in Delta State, Nigeria. Nwaoboshi attended St.Thomas Teachers College where he obtained his West African School Certificate in 1976. In 1986, he graduated from University of Benin where he obtained a Bachelor of Laws. He also has a Master of Laws from Delta State University. == Career == Nwaoboshi began his career in 1979 as an aide to Samuel Ogbemudia, Governor of the defunct Bendel State. Subsequently, he was appointed Chairman of the Nigerian Railway Corporation. In 1999, he was also a political adviser to Governor James Ibori. In 2000, he was appointed Commissioner for Agriculture and Special Duties in Delta State where he served in that position till 2006.

According to the summons filed against him by his opponent in the party primaries Prince Nwoko stated that the People's Democractic party had unlawfully announced him the winner after he was defeated in the primaries, it was also alleged that Nwoboshi hired thugs to cause a mass scare and stampede when he learnt of his brewing defeat. On 4 April 2019, Nwaoboshi appealed to the judgement sacking him as senator-elect. On 17 April 2019, a Federal High Court in Abuja denied Nwaoboshi's appeal to issue a restraining order to Independent National Electoral Commission stating that it was out of its jurisdiction as an Appeal court had already ruled on the case, consequently the Justice Mahmud Mohammed ordered that Independent National Electorate Commission should withdraw the certificate of return issued to Nwaoboshi and reissue a new certificate to Prince Ned Nwoko.Although he is now the Delta North Senator On 11 May 2019, the Independent National Electoral Commission withdrew the certificate of return issued to Nwaoboshi. === Bills sponsored === In 2016, Peter Nwaoboshi sponsored a bill \\"The Code of Conduct Act Cap C15 LFN 2004 (Amendment) Bill, 2016 (SB 248)\\".

After attending an agricultural school, she became a veterinary assistant. In her work as a veterinary assistant, Jönsson had to drive a car, regularly visiting 7-8 farms each day. It was then her interest in (fast) driving was born, and after a while she started recording lap times between the different farms. Both Ewy (now with the surname Rosqvist after her marriage with Yngve Rosqvist) and her husband became members of Royal Automobile Club, in the beginning with her husband Yngve Rosqvist doing most of the driving, with his wife as a co-driver. After the Automobile Club expressed their interest in her, Ewy Rosqvist started competing as a driver as well. ===Rallying career=== Ewy Rosqvist was quick to become a competitive racer, and after a while she was one of Europe's best female drivers. In 1960, she signed as a factory driver for Volvo. Two years later, Mercedes Benz bought out her contract, starting her international career in earnest. During her most intense years of competition, she could have as much as 280 travel days away from home. She won the European Championship in 1959, 1960 and 1961, the latter shared with Pat Moss. She won the ladies' classification in Midnattssolsrallyt (\\"Rally to the Midnight Sun\\", now called Rally Sweden) from 1959 to 1962. alt= In 1962, Ewy Rosqvist successfully participated in the Argentine Turismo Standard Grand Prix (as the first female), she drove a large (2 ton) Mercedes-Benz 220 SE with Ursula Wirth co-driving. The duo won all six stages and also set a new speed record for the race. In 1961 the average speed of the winner was 121 km/h, Rosqvist's average in 1962 was almost 127 km/h. In the following years, Rosqvist placed second and third (in 1963 and 1964 respectively) in the Argentine GP, as well as victories in the 2.5-litre class in both the Monte Carlo Rally and on the Nürburgring. She also participated successfully in the Acropolis and Spa-Sofia-Liège rallies. ===Later years=== Rosqvist stopped participating in large races after Mercedes-Benz disbanded their factory rally team in 1965. By then, new manufacturers with lighter cars had made the relatively heavy Mercedes much less competitive. Ewy Rosqvist got an offer to drive for Audi, but instead chose to end her career in top-tier rallying. In June 1964, she married Alexander von Korff, head of the Mercedes- Benz motorsport division. Ewy Rosqvist stopped competing in 1967, after a career completely without accidents, crashes or broken cars. Her trophies and race car are displayed at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart. She worked for many years at the museum as a guide and was a test driver for new Mercedes models. Rosqvist remained for several years in Stuttgart after Alexander von Korff died in 1977, but eventually moved back to Sweden. There she met Karl Gustav Svedberg, head of the company Philipson Bil AB, an importer and dealer of Mercedes-Benz automobiles. They lived together until his death in 2009. ==Awards== Årets idrottskvinna (female athlete of the year) 1961, awarded by the Stockholms-Tidningen newspaper. ==References== \\"Ewy Rosqvist-von Korff\\", Nationalencyklopedin.

Gunstock manufacturing building of the former Eddystone Rifle Plant ==Wartime locomotive orders== Baldwin received locomotive orders from Imperial Russia, France, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland as those nations' manufacturing facilities were refocused on armaments production. Baldwin's vice president Samuel M. Vauclain visited Russia in 1914 to obtain orders for thirty 0-6-6-0 Mallet locomotives for the 3 ft 6 in gauge railways between Arkhangelsk and Vologda. This was followed by orders for 2-10-0 Russian gauge locomotives and 75 cm gauge gasoline locomotives for Russian trench railways. France ordered more than one-thousand trench railway locomotives, and the United Kingdom ordered 495 trench railway locomotives and 465 locomotives for standard-gauge railways. ==Eddystone Ammunition Corporation== The Eddystone Ammunition Corporation was formed to manufacture the type of shell 2nd from the left. France and the United Kingdom then placed orders with Baldwin for artillery shells of calibers from to . Although Baldwin's Philadelphia plant was enlarged to include a 4-story extension to the truck shop and a new 8-story building, completion of ammunition orders required construction of new manufacturing facilities at Eddystone, where Baldwin had been operating a shop since 1905. Baldwin formed the Eddystone Ammunition Corporation on 10 June 1915 to manufacture 2,500,000 shrapnel shells of Russian design. The Eddystone Ammunition plant adjacent to the Delaware River was operational by November 1915 including a modern wharf along the river front. This plant was the source of the Eddystone explosion which killed 133 people on 10 April 1917. Another Baldwin subsidiary, the Eddystone Munitions Company, was organized on 27 September 1917 to manufacture shrapnel for the United States government. Total production was 6,565,355 artillery shells before the plant was converted to locomotive shops in 1919. ==Eddystone Rifle Plant== The Eddystone Rifle Plant was built to manufacture these Pattern 1914 Enfield rifles. On 30 April 1915 the United Kingdom placed a contract with Remington Arms for 1,500,000 Pattern 1914 Enfield rifles. When Remington subcontracted the bulk of this order to Baldwin, Baldwin built a rifle plant at Eddystone, the largest factory in the United States during World War I. This Eddystone Rifle Plant began production on 31 December 1915 with 10,000 machines powered by of belting from of line shafts. The rifle plant employed 15,294 workers, with women accounting for 20 percent of the peak work force, manufacturing up to 6,000 rifles per day. Rifle plant operations ceased on 11 January 1919 after producing 1,959,954 rifles with spare parts equivalent to 200,000 more rifles. Contract changes resulted in most rifles being completed to the modified M1917 Enfield design, which was carried by nearly two-thirds of the American Expeditionary Forces. ==Sources== Category:1915 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Ammunition manufacturers Category:Companies based in Delaware County, Pennsylvania Category:Defunct companies based in Pennsylvania Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of the United States Category:Firearm manufacturers of the United States ","title":"Eddystone Arsenal"},{"id":"60380835","text":"The 1988 Sovran Bank Classic was a men's tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts at the Rock Creek Park in Washington, D.C. in the United States that was part of the 1988 Nabisco Grand Prix.

Recorded at the group's own studios, the album was then released by Up Records in August 1999. Shock- No-Par exemplifies the group's unusual lineup and set-up, with much of the music being played with Steinke's homemade inventions and the distinctive Octant robot—also created by Steinke—which provides the album's percussion and was credited as a band member, alongside Steinke, who added vocals and keyboards, and Tassany Zimmerman, who added backing vocals and operated the Macintosh used to control the homemade creations. The album's music is lo-fi in style despite its computerised origins, and explores the group's unusual take on electronica and rock music. The songs are accessible despite their unusual creation, although much of the music is instrumental. The album's CD edition also included two surreal music videos created by Steinke as bonus CD- ROM content. Upon release, the album found favour with music critics, who highlighted the album's unusual sound. ==Background and recording== Described as a multimedia project, Octant was formed in Seattle by singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Matt Steinke, who at the time was also the leader of the indie band Mocket. Noted as the act's distinguishing feature, Octant featured a robot, also named Octant, which was built by Steinke from pieces found in laboratories, lofts and pawn shops, after wishing to create a machine which combined the disciplines he had accumulated having studied music and kinetic art at evergreen State College, and later electronics post-graduation. Described as an \\"automated collection of mallets bolted onto a drum kit,\\" the robot acted as the group's drum machine. Writer Heather Phares wrote that \\"this willingness to reject conventional ideas about electronics, music, and electronic music defines Octant's unpretentious yet inventive stance.\\" Octant recorded Shock-No-Par at Electronic Music Studio from December 1998 to March 1999. The Octant robot, among homemade robots, played the percussive and noise parts on the album, while Steinke contributed keyboards and vocals, and third member Tassany Zimmerman added backing vocals and operated the Macintosh which controlled the robots. Among the Octant inventions on the record are the Ad3 Robotic Percussion Unit, Light-Modulated Synthesizer, Random Tone Generator, Photo Theremin and Electrified String Board. Pierre Crutchfield played bass clarinet on the songs \\"Auto 1\\", \\"Ingenous\\" and \\"This or What\\". The album was mixed by Octant and Martin Feveyear at Jupiter Seattle in April 1999. ==Composition== Although most of Shock-No-Par was created using the homemade robots, the album departs from other robot-centred bands like Servotron and Captured! by Robots due to the record's \\"odd, cluttered rock songs\\" which incorporate bleeping, whirring and clattering sounds. Despite the high-minded concept behind the act, the album's music is accessible, aided by the simplistic vocals. Tim Dickinson of Mother Jones Magazine felt that, due to the robots, Octant's take on electronica on the album is accordingly raw and tactile, with \\"a live feel that belies its computer origins.\\" He noted the record's \\"unusual marriage of high-tech and lo-fi, of baroque feedback loops and hummable melodies, is difficult to categorise.\\" Writer Glen Sarvady, meanwhile, described the music as a hazy hybrid of krautrock and new wave with dance backbeats, while comparing the album to \\"deranged carnival music.\\" Most of the album is instrumental, emphasising the robot instruments. Among the album's songs, \\"The Move\\" and \\"Simplexity\\" incorporate understated guitars, \\"boy-girl\\" vocals, layered synthesizers and the Octant drum robot. \\"Auto 1\\" emphasises drumbeats and basslines which sound reversed, while \\"Ingenous\\" features wildly distorted tones and an organ line reminiscent of Booker T. The multimedia CD edition also contains two music videos credited to Steinke. These are set to the act's music and are surreal in style, shot in stop-action and featuring disembodied baby doll heads, not unlike the act's visual aspects during live performances. Reviewer Heather Phares described the music on the videos as \\"techno-scapes\\". Unlike the CD version, the vinyl edition features two bonus tracks in \\"3/4 Nostalgia\\" and \\"Green Drop .2\\", the latter of which features a dot matrix printer. ==Release and reception== Shock-No-Par was released by Up Records on August 10, 1999. The packaging was designed by Mariko Marrs and Robert Jordan. The album was added to numerous college radio stations, as evidenced by it reaching number 11 on the Radio 200 Adds chart, published in CMJ New Music Monthly. In the same magazine's CMJ Radio 200 chart, compiled by reports of airplay from the magazine's panel of radio stations, the album reached number 45, and also peaked at number 38 on the Core Radio chart. Heather Phares of AllMusic wrote that the album \\"combines homespun visual and musical artistry with technological know-how,\\" and praised \\"Octant's unpretentious yet inventive stance.\\" Similarly, Tim Dickinson of Mother Jones Magazine hailed the album as adventurous and \\"easy to love\\" despite its unusual sound. Ian Danzig of Exclaim! commented that the act's sonic landscape is populated by \\"[s]trange gurgles and squelches,\\" highlighting how the \\"mad scientist-type machines that will take us into the next century.\\" He highlighted how the album's dark pop songs inhabit \\"a world of sensory overload, but an overload of samples and analogue sounds we know.\\" In a positive review for PopMatters, Brendan Maher wrote that \\"Shock-No-Par expertly explores the duo's music-meets-machine as the living accompany the automated in on a bouncy little trip into the mind of a mad scientist.\\" He hailed Octant as an original act on an aesthetic level, but noted that \\"their music is surprisingly infectious, if not just a little danceable.\\" Glen Sarvady of CMJ New Music Monthly recommended the album to fans of Devo, Kraftwerk and Quasi, and praised the approachable music. Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club wrote that the record is an often \\"fairly compelling racket,\\" especially on the \\"Pong\\" instrumental, but nonetheless felt the album's concept was more successful than the music, commenting: \\"If you didn't know Octant's music was made by robots, you'd just think Shock-no-par is an extremely clamorous, relatively minor rock record.\\" Television music supervisor Shawn Petersen named Shock-No-Par as one of his top ten albums of 1999, as listed in the year-end issue of CMJ New Music Monthly. ==Track listing== All songs written by Octant # \\"The Move\\" – 2:34 # \\"Auto 1\\" – 3:28 # \\"Igneous\\" – 3:02 # \\"Revert\\" – 2:57 # \\"This and What\\" – 3:33 # \\"Uncomplexed\\" – 2:05 # \\"Simplexity\\" – 3:03 # \\"Pong\\" – 4:06 # \\"65CXV\\" – 0:34 ===CD-ROM content=== # * \\"Mow\\" (video) – 1:54 # \\"65CXV\\" (video) – 3:59 ==Personnel== *Tassany Zimmerman – performer, mixing, recording, writing *Matthew Steinke – performer, films, mixing, writing *Mariko Mars – art direction, design *Robert Jordan – art direction, design, artwork (resin sphere) *Joe Walker – artwork (CD-ROM projector) *Krista Steinke – photography *Martin Feveyear – mixing *Barry Corliss – mastering ==References== Category:1999 debut albums Category:Octant (band) albums Category:Up Records albums Category:Lo-fi music albums ","title":"Shock-No-Par"},{"id":"60380921","text":"A number of ships have been named SS Benlomond, after Ben Lomond, a mountain in Scotland.

The forts are situated in the municipality of Vila Franca de Xira, in the Lisbon District of Portugal. From north to south the three forts are the Fort of Aguieira, the Fort of Portela Grande, and the Fort of Portela Pequena. ==History== Following the Treaty of Fontainebleau signed between France and Spain in October 1807, which provided for the invasion of Portugal, French troops under the command of General Junot entered Portugal, leading to a Portuguese request for support from the British. In July 1808 troops commanded by the Duke of Wellington, at the time known as Arthur Wellesley, defeated French troops at the Battles of Roliça and Vimeiro. This forced Junot to negotiate the Convention of Cintra, which led to the evacuation of the French army from Portugal. In March 1809, Marshal Soult led a new French expedition that advanced south to the city of Porto before being repulsed by Portuguese- British troops and forced to withdraw. View of the Fort of Aguieira from the Fort of Portela Grande The threat of a further invasions by the French led Wellington, on October 20, 1809, to order the secret construction of defensive lines in order to protect Lisbon from Napoléon Bonaparte's troops led by Marechal Masséna. A total of 152 military installations were constructed, armed with 534 cannon and garrisoned with about 34,000 troops. Each work was given a number and the three forts discussed here were Numbers 40-42. They were built at the top of the Aguieira mountain range, providing excellent views of the surrounding area and of the River Tagus. View of the entrance to the magazine of the Fort of Portela Grande. The fort is now topped by a survey marker ==Fort of Aguieira== Construction of this fort (Number 40) began in February 1810, following an irregular star-shaped design, and was completed before October. It is situated at an altitude of 280 metres. The fort was not fitted with cannon: instead it was garrisoned with 150 soldiers whose main task was to protect the other two forts and cover surrounding roads. ==Fort of Portela Grande== Fort Number 41 was constructed at the same time as the Fort of Aguieira and had a garrison of 240 men. It supported defences along the Tagus, providing fire to the west, as well as to the east in order to provide cover for the Fort of Casa, which was lower down and closer to the river. Portela Grande dominated the Bucelas gorge and it could also exchange crossfire with the Fort of Arpim to the north-northwest. At an altitude of 274 metres the fort of Portela Grande was built as an irregular 11-sided polygon surrounded by a dry moat, with gun emplacements. It had five cannon. As with Portela Pequena, the Fort of Portela Grande had a stone-lined magazine, which was unusual in the Lines of Torres Vedras where most of the magazines were wood lined. The fort is now topped by a survey marker. A wide-angled view of the Fort of Portela Pequena ==Fort of Portela Pequena== The Fort of Portela Pequena is a short walk from the Fort of Portela Grande and had similar objectives to cover possible invasion along roads and the River Tagus. “Pequena” means “small” in Portuguese but, with 350 troops, this fort (Number 42) had a garrison larger than the “large” fort. It had six cannon. Like Portela Grande it had a dry moat protected by escarpments. ==See also== *List of forts of the Lines of Torres Vedras ==References== * Serra da Aguieira Category:Lines of Torres Vedras ==External Links== * Friends of the Lines of Torres Vedras ","title":"Forts of Serra da Aguieira"},{"id":"60381037","text":"Shreya Tripathi (died 9 October 2018) was an Indian health activist.

When the worm met with the sky god, he stated: \\"A man has died, and they have sent me to ask you what they should do with him.\\" The sky god gave him the following instructions: \\"Go and tell them to take the corpse, and hang it in the fork of a tree and throw mush at it until it comes back to life. When it comes back to life, no one else will ever die.\\" The worm began the journey back to the Bura people to deliver the instructions. === Introduction of the trickster === Unbeknownst to the worm, another creature (the lizard Agadzagadza) had been eavesdropping on the conversation between the worm and the sky god. As a trickster, the lizard wanted to create chaos, and because he was a lizard, he could travel much faster than the worm. Agadzagadza reached the people first. He told them that the sky god had sent him instead of the worm, because he was a faster creature. Agadzagadza told them that the correct way to deal with the situation was to \\"dig a grave, wrap the corpse in cloth, and bury it in the grave\\", which was a lie. === The return of the worm === The worm, unaware of everything that had transpired, eventually arrived with his instructions. When the people realized they had been tricked, the people were mad at the worm for being slow, and blamed him for the fact they handled the situation incorrectly. The worm countered with the point that the people had sent him on the mission, but impatiently chose instead to listen to another creature's advice. The worm argued that because of the trickery, the people should remove the man from the grave, and once again consult the sky god for advice. The people did not want to expend any extra effort exhuming the man's body from the ground. and opted not to pursue the matter further. === Effects on mankind === If the man's death had been handled as the sky god dictated, then mankind would never know death again, but because the people out of sloth neglected to correct their mistake, death would stay a factor in their lives forever. It is referred to as the \\"crime that Agadzagadza committed against us\\", though humanity's laziness was a factor as well. == Alternate versions == Alternate versions of the myth feature small changes to the tale's structure. One version specifies that the worm is sent to visit the god Hyel, who is referred to as a moon god rather than a sky god and is also credited with being the preeminent god figure and progenitor. This version also specifies that the first man dies around the same time the populace began to burgeon, shortly after the dawn of their culture. In this tale the worm is faster at returning and, finding that the people have just finished their burial process, insists they reverse the burial and follow the instructions given to him by Hyel rather than advising that they consult the god for further instructions. == African mythology == === Reptile figures === The use of a lizard as a mythological figure is not exclusive to the people of Nigeria. Other cultures in Africa use lizards, chameleons, frogs and snakes in explanations of their culture and environment. One possible reason for the selection of these types of animals is their changeable natures. Lizards in particular have the ability to regrow their tails, making the lizard a prime candidate for a story about regeneration or rebirth. Reptiles are not always negatively depicted or used as figures of chaos, nor are they always depicted as male. For instance, there is a serpent Aido-Hwedo, from the mythology of neighboring country Benin. The serpent wrapped itself around the Earth, acting as a support system for the planet after the world was created. === Other mythology pertaining to the origins of death === Additional mythology relating to the concepts of life and death exists throughout African cultures. Examples of these stories were collected by James George Frazer in his book The Belief in Immortality and the Worship of the Dead. In some cases, the creatures involved are also reptilian, such as the chameleon in the mythology of the Zulu. In that tale, the chameleon was given a message of life, but because he moved too slowly, he was beaten by a lizard carrying an opposing message. Thus, the chameleon is held in little regard in that culture. == References == == External links == * Brief history, belief, marriage, and language of this beautiful people at Pulse.ng Category:African mythology Category:Legendary reptiles Category:Mythological tricksters ","title":"Agadzagadza"},{"id":"60381055","text":"James Watt WS FRSE FRSGS LLD (21 March 1863-3 December 1945) was a 19th/20th- century Scottish lawyer, actuary and geographer. ==Life== 24 Rothesay Terrace, Edinburgh Watt was born in Edinburgh on 21 March 1863.

For each letter a and location \\\\ell, let \\\\mathcal B_{a,\\\\ell} be a set of clock constraints such that their zones partition \\\\mathbb R_{\\\\ge 0}^{X}, with X the number of clocks. Given a clock valuation u, let c(a,\\\\ell, u) be the only clock constraint of \\\\mathcal B_{a,\\\\ell} which is satisfied by u. An alternating timed-automaton contains a transition function, which associates to a 3-tuple (\\\\ell,a,c), with c\\\\in\\\\mathcal B_{a,\\\\ell}, to an element of \\\\mathcal B^+(L\\\\times\\\\mathcal P(C)). For example, (\\\\ell_1,\\\\emptyset)\\\\lor((\\\\ell_2,\\\\\\\\{x\\\\\\\\})\\\\land(\\\\ell_2,\\\\\\\\{y\\\\\\\\})) is an element of \\\\mathcal B^+(L\\\\times\\\\mathcal P(C)). Intuitively, it means that the run may either continue by moving to location \\\\ell_1, and resetting no clock. Or by moving to location \\\\ell_2 and should be successful when either x or y is reset. === Formal definition === Formally, an alternating timed automaton is a tuple \\\\mathcal A=\\\\langle \\\\Sigma,L,L_0,C,F,E\\\\rangle that consists of the following components: * Σ is a finite set called the alphabet or actions of \\\\mathcal A. * L is a finite set. The elements of L are called the locations or states' of \\\\mathcal A. * C is a finite set called the clocks of \\\\mathcal A. * L_0\\\\subseteq L is the set of start locations. * F\\\\subseteq L is the set of accepting locations. * E\\\\subseteq L\\\\times\\\\Sigma\\\\times\\\\mathcal B(C)\\\\to\\\\mathcal B^+(L\\\\times \\\\mathcal P(C)) is the transitions function of \\\\mathcal A. It is a partial function, defined as explained in the previous section. Any Boolean expression can be rewritten into an equivalent expression in disjunctive normal form. In the representation of a ATA, each disjunction is represented by a different arrow. Each conjunct of a disjunction is represented by a set of arrows with the same tail and multiple heads. The tail is labelled by the letter and each head is labelled by the set of clocks it resets. == Run == We now define a run of an alternating timed automaton over a timed word w=(\\\\sigma_1,t_1),(\\\\sigma_2,t_2),\\\\dots,. There are two equivalent way to define a run, either as a tree or as a game. === Run as a tree === In this definition of a run, a run is not anymore a list of pairs, but a rooted tree. The node of the trooted tree are labelled by pairs with a location and a clock valuation. The tree is defined as follows: * the root of the tree is of the form (\\\\ell_0, u_0) with \\\\ell_0\\\\in L_0, * Consider a node n of the tree at depth i, with label (\\\\ell, u). Without loss of generality, let us assume that E(a_{i+1},\\\\ell,c(a,\\\\ell, u)) is in disjunctive normal form, i.e. it is of the form \\\\bigvee_{i=1}^n\\\\bigwedge_{j=1}^{m_i}(\\\\ell_{i,j}, r_{i,j}). Then the node n has m_i children, for some 1\\\\le i\\\\le n. The j-th child is labelled by (\\\\ell_{i,j},( u+t_{i+1}-t_{i})[r_{i,j}\\\\to 0]. The definition of an accepting runs differs depending on whether the timed word is finite or infinite. If the timed word is finite, then the run is accepting if the label of each leaf contains an accepting location. If the timed word is infinite, then a run is accepting if each branch contains an infinite number of accepting location. === Run as a game === A run can also be defined as a two player game G_{A,w}. Let us call the two players \\"player\\" and \\"opponent\\". The goal of the player is to create an accepting run and the goal of the opponent is to create a rejecting (non-accepting) run. Each state of the game is a tuple composed of a location, a clock valuation, a position in the word, and potentially an element of \\\\mathcal B^+(L\\\\times\\\\mathcal P(C)). Intuitively, a tuple (\\\\ell, u,i,b) means that the run has read i letters, is in location \\\\ell, with clock value u, and that the transition will be as described by b. The run is defined as follow: * The initial state is of the form (\\\\ell_0, u_0, 0), for some \\\\ell_0\\\\in L_0. * given a state (\\\\ell, u,i), if the length of the word is i, the run ends. Otherwise, its successor state is (\\\\ell, u,i,c(a_{i+1},\\\\ell, u)). * The successor of a state (\\\\ell, u,i,(\\\\ell',r)) is the state (\\\\ell', u+t_{i}-t_{i-1}[r\\\\to0],i+1), * The successor of a state (\\\\ell, u,i,\\\\phi\\\\lor\\\\psi) is chosen by the player, it is either (\\\\ell, u,i,\\\\phi) or (\\\\ell, u,i,\\\\psi), * The successor of a state (\\\\ell, u,i,\\\\phi\\\\land\\\\psi) is chosen by the opponent, it is either (\\\\ell, u,i,\\\\phi) or (\\\\ell, u,i,\\\\psi). The set of successive states starting in a state of the form (\\\\ell, u,i) and ending in before the next such state is called a phase. The definition of an accepting run is the same than for timed automata. == Subclass of ATA == === One clock alternating timed automaton === A one clock alternating timed automaton (OCATA) is an alternating timed automaton using a single clock. The expressivity of OCATAs and of timed-automaton are incomparable. For example, the language over the alphabet \\\\\\\\{a\\\\\\\\} such that there is never exactly one time unit between two letters can not be recognized by a timed-automaton. However, the OCATA pictured nearbyOCATA accepting the language in which no two letters occurs at 1 time unit of interval accepts itOCATA accepting the language in which no two letters occurs at 1 time unit of interval. In this alternating timed automaton, two branches are started. A branch restarts the clock x, and ensures that each time in the future when a letter is emitted, the clock x is distinct from 1. This ensure that between this letter and the next ones, the time elapsed is not one. The second branch only waits for other letters to be emitted and do the same checking. === Purely-Universal and Purely-Exisential ATA === An ATA is said to be purely-universal (respectively, purely- exisential) if its transition function does not use disjunction (respectively, conjunction). Purely-existential ATAs are as expressive as non-deterministic timed-automaton. == Closure == The class of language accepted by ATAs and by OCATAs is closed under complement. The construction is explained for the case where there is a single initial location. Given an ATA \\\\mathcal A=\\\\langle \\\\Sigma,L,\\\\\\\\{q_0\\\\\\\\},C,F,E\\\\rangle accepting a timed language L, its complement language L^c is accepted by an automaton A^c which is essentially \\\\langle \\\\Sigma,L,\\\\\\\\{q_0\\\\\\\\},C,L\\\\setminus F,E'\\\\rangle, where E'(\\\\ell,a,c) is defined as E(\\\\ell,a,c)) where disjunction and conjunctions are reversed and E'(q_0,a,c) simulates the run from each of the locations of L_0 simultaneously. It follows that the class of language accepted by ATAs and by OCATAs are accepted by unions and intersection. The union of two languages is constructed by taking disjoint copies of the automata accepting both language. The intersection can be constructed from union and concatenation. == Complexity == The emptiness problem, the universality problem and the containability problem for OCATA is decidable but is a nonelementary problem. Those three problems are undecidable over ATAs. ==References== Category:Automata (computation) Category:Model checking ","title":"Alternating timed automaton"},{"id":"60381368","text":"June Edmonds (born 1959) is an American painter, teaching artist, and public artist.

In parallel computing, all-to-all (also known as index operation or total exchange) is a collective operation, where each processor sends an individual message to every other processor. Initially, each processor holds p messages of size m each, and the goal is to exchange the i-th message of processor j with the j-th message of processor i. The number of communication rounds and the overall communication volume are measures to evaluate the quality of an all-to-all algorithm. We consider a single-ported full-duplex machine throughout this article. On such a machine, an all-to-all algorithm requires at least \\\\lceil \\\\log_2 n\\\\rceil communication rounds. Further a minimum of \\\\left\\\\lceil \\\\frac{m(n-1)}{k}\\\\right\\\\rceil units of data is transferred. Optimum for both these measures can not be achieved simultaneously. Depending on the network topology (fully connected, hypercube, ring), different all-to-all algorithms are required. ==All-to-all algorithms based on topology== Visualization of an all-to-all algorithm in a ring topology. Visualization of an all-to-all algorithm in a mesh topology. We consider a single-ported machine. The way the data is routed through the network depends on its underlying topology. We take a look at all-to-all algorithms for common network topologies. ===Hypercube=== A hypercube is a network topology, where two processors share a link, if the hamming distance of their indizies is one. The idea of an all-to-all algorithm is to combine messages belonging to the same subcube, and then distribute them. ===Ring=== An all-to-all algorithm in a ring topology is very intuitive. Initially a processor sends a message of size m(p-1) to one of its neighbors. Communication is performed in the same direction on all processors. When a processor receives a message, he extracts the part that belongs to him and forwards the remainder of the message to the next neighbor. After (p-1) communication rounds, every message is distributed to its destination. The time taken by this algorithm is (t_s+\\\\frac{1}{2}t_wmp)(p-1). Here t_s is the startup cost for a communication, and t_w is the cost of transmitting a unit of data. This term can further be improved when half of the messages are sent in one and the other half in the other direction. This way, messages arrive earlier at their destination. ===Mesh=== For a mesh we look at a \\\\sqrt{p}\\\\times\\\\sqrt{p} mesh. This algorithm is easily adaptable for any mesh. An all-to-all algorithm in a mesh consists of two communication phases. First, each processors groups the messages into \\\\sqrt{p} groups, each containing \\\\sqrt{p} messages. Messages are in the same group, if their destined processors share the same row. Next, an all-to-all operation among rows is performed. Each processor now holds all relevant information for processors in his column. Again, the messages need to be rearranged. After another all-to-all operation, this time in respect to columns, each processor ends up with its messages. The overall time of communication for this algorithm is (2t_s+t_wmp)(\\\\sqrt{p}-1). Additionally, time for the local rearrangement of messages adds to the overall runtime of the algorithm. ==1-factor algorithm== A visualization of the 1-factor algorithm. Again, we consider a single-ported machine. A trivial algorithm, is to send (p-1) asynchronous messages into the network for each processor. The performance of this algorithm is poor, which is due to congestion arising because of the bisection width of the network. More sophisticated algorithms combine messages to reduce the number of send operations and try to control congestion. For large messages, the cost of a startup is small compared to the cost of transmitting the payload. It is faster to send messages directly to their destination. In the following algorithm an all-to-all algorithm is performed using (p-1) one-to-one routings. //p odd: // pe index j\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,\\\\dots,p-1\\\\\\\\} for i:=0 to p-1 do Exchange data with PE (i-j)\\\\,\\\\mod\\\\, p //p even: // pe index j\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,\\\\dots,p-1\\\\\\\\} for i:=0 to p-2 do idle:=\\\\frac{p}{2}i\\\\,\\\\mod\\\\,(p-1) if j=p-1 then exchange data with PE idle else if j=idle then exchange data with pe p-1 else exchange data with PE (i-j) mod (p-1) The algorithm has a different behavior, whether p is odd or even. In case p is odd, one processor is idle in each iteration. For an even p, this idle processor communicates with the processor with index p-1. The total time taken is (p-1)(t_s+t_wm) for an even p, and p(t_s+t_wm) for an odd p respectively. Instead of pairing processor j with processor (i-j) \\\\bmod p in iteration i, we can also use the exclusive-or of j and i to determine a mapping. This approach requires p to be a power of two. Depending on the underlying topology of the network, one approach might be superior to the other. The exclusive or approach is superior, when performing pairwise one-to- one routings in a hypercube or fat-tree. ==References== Category:Parallel computing ","title":"All-to-all (parallel pattern)"},{"id":"60381377","text":"The 5P-42 Filin (eagle owl), is a Russian electro-optic countermeasure system developed by Roselectronics for the Russian Armed Forces. The system is designed to disrupt enemy's combatants eyesight at night and preventing them from targeting a protected platform.

It was first unveiled in December 2018, and its naval version is currently being deployed at the Admiral Gorshkov-class frigates. ==Design== The 5P-42 Filin creates a powerful beam of light, similar to the strobe-like effect, preventing enemy soldiers from aiming and targeting protected platforms, especially if they are using guns. During tests, volunteers reported having trouble to reach their target when using rifles and guns to shoot targets that were protected by the system, because they couldn't see. Additionally, about half of the volunteers said they felt dizzy, nauseous and disoriented and about 20 percent of the volunteers reported experiencing hallucinations. The effective range of the system is while its impact angle is 10-15 degrees. The Filin can be also effectively used against various military electronics operating in the optical spectrum such as infrared laser rangefinders, night-vision goggles or anti-tank missile launchers at a distance up to .

Mashetani was written in Kiswahili and takes place in Tanzania shortly after the political independence. The play centers around the relationship of the characters Juma and Kitaru. The play is four acts. Mashetani has some absurdist elements, including a play within the play and a dream sequence. Hussein also adds descriptions in the stage directions which give the play a more abstract, surreal impression. In Swahili, shetani (singular) is the word for an East African spirit. These spirits are mostly malevolent and appear as distorted figures. The play has been translated to English by Joshua Williams (Oxford University Press: 2021 forthcoming). == Plot == === Act 1 === Act one opens on Juma and Kitaru out for a walk. They stop in front of a baobab tree and begin a performance of 'The Devil and Man'. Juma plays the Devil and Kitaru, the man. The rest of the act is performed with the added layer of the Devil (Juma) and Kitaru (Man), until the very end when Juma breaks character to reconcile with Kitaru after the dark subject matter scares them. The Devil transforms into a bird, and flaunts other tricks, to convince Man of his supernatural superiority. The Devil then insists Man express the fear, and other emotions, Man feels in his heart—on his face. The Devil wants to see his effect on Man. The Devil explains that if you wear the emotions other people desire on your face, even if they contrast with those in your heart, they will eventually merge. The Devil then demands Man approach him. After several attempts, Man approaches and bows in reverence, and The Devil is immediately pleased and begins to laugh, becoming violent. He then transforms into a \\"gentle, meek, and humble man\\", keep in mind he is still spiritually masked as The Devil. He then starts to grin (in pain), then laughs inaudibly. The Devil then commands Man to repeatedly say the devilish word \\"gashalazeritwas\\" (unclear in meaning), however, it has a very powerful effect on Man. As The Devil repeats his command, it slowly tortures Man by drawing blood and breaking his organs. This results in The Man fainting from the pain while The Devil grins. The Devil speaks to Man on the bitterness of birth; he faints again. Lights out. The Man wakes up much later, huddled under the baobab tree. He can hear The Devil but cannot see him; The Devil taunts him with laughter. He reveals he has transformed himself into the wind. Man wants The Devil to fight him, he wants to kill The Devil. They argue for a while and The Devil agrees to reveal himself under the conditions that he gets to make three requests, the Man obliges. The Devil reappears and states his first request, \\"Have you ever heard of someone who slaughtered himself?” Two, that Man celebrates his death before he kills him, and three, that Man chooses how they celebrate. Man decides on a waltz. The pair happily waltz and drink wine. Suddenly, The Devil offers Man the knife in which he kills him. With every stab to the ribs, The Devil laughs harder until he is dead. The Man observes the corpse and reconciles with his actions. He then sings a song under the baobab tree. Man begins to monologue about the previous events and how they altered him. It is at the end of this monologue that Man is transformed back into Kitaru and exits the stage. Juma appears after, trying to reconcile with Kitaru. He calls for him, but Kitaru does not respond. Juma exits the stage. Blackout. \\\\- === Act 2 === The entirety of Act Two is performed in the dark, with fog. There are small bursts of light, often red but not always. The act takes place inside of Kitaru's mind, therefore his head must be placed on stage somehow (picture, projection, etc.). There is laughter throughout the act that is supposed to drown out the actors, and they must compete with it—later resulting in a harsh silence. ====Scene One==== Inside Kitaru's house, Mama Kitaru iron's clothes. Juma arrives looking for Kitaru. Mama Kitaru explains that he is not in, however, the two of them converse about how hard both the men in their families work. Mama Kitaru explains how overworked she feels. Later, Juma and Kitaru converse in his room about classes and the pros and cons of attending university. After Juma offers to go to the cinema, Kitaru declines his offer because the only film Juma wants to see is one about cowboys and \\"Indians\\". Their conversation slowly becomes an argument about the oppressed/the oppressor, Kitaru remembers the play from a few days ago. Harsh laughter is inserted throughout their argument. Baba Kitaru arrives while they argue. He shows the family his new Mercedes Benz. Their frightening laughter grows. Juma exits. Kitaru and Baba Kitaru drive off. ====Scene Two==== Bab Kitaru reads the newspaper, Mama Kitaru sews, and Kitaru tries to read a book but is distracted. Mfaume arrives at the top of the act. The three converse for a moment, then Baba Kitaru notices Kitaru is lost in thought. Kitaru explains the play about Devils and his infatuation with it. Kitaru then explains the sense of separation he feels with Juma, resulting in him running off stage. Baba Kitaru and Mama Kitaru discuss the incident, Mama Kitaru expresses her concern about the devil. Bab Kitaru dismisses the incident as nothing more than a headache. ====Scene Three==== Later, Kitaru sits in the house, thinking; Mama Kitaru enters. Kitaru explains he is thinking of a story Juma's grandmother told them the other day, the story of a devilish fish. Kitaru explains devils to his mother, she grows fearful of her son. She dismisses Kitaru's stories as myths of their culture's past. Mfaume enters and Mama Kitaru exits. Kitaru asks Mfaume if he believes in devils. Mfaume explains their hidden nature and continues with his work. Kitaru is left on stage, fearful. ====Scene Four==== Kitaru has been asleep for a long time. Mama and Baba Kitaru argue over which doctor will best treat him, a medical one or the witch doctor. The medical doctor arrives and dismisses Kitaru's state as neurosis and mental exhaustion, which is why he gave him sleeping pills. The doctor suggests Kitaru see a psychiatrist if his condition doesn't improve. === Act 3 === Act three takes place in Juma's home. Mama Juma has a problem with Juma's attitude, yet Grandmother believes Mama Juma's arguments to be flawed. She is bitter about the wealth taken away from their family and mentions everything Juma would've had. Juma leaves right before Baba Juma comes home. The second scene takes place in a bar and centers around Juma, two waiters and two customers. Waiter one asks if the customers would like a double or single whisky, and Customer one responds defensively, assuming the waiter has just underestimated his knowledge about whisky. Customer two tries to defuse the tension by explaining the situation to Customer one, but Customer one disregards him. He then explains to Customer two that this is the African man's time and that he refuses to die a poor man. The scene ends with Juma deciding whether or not he will discuss with Kitaru, and he chooses not to. === Act 4 === Act four begins with Juma visiting Kitaru's house. Juma discovers that Kitaru has been acting strange. Kitaru has been quieter than usual, sleeping for an abnormally large amount of time, and sweating profusely. He tells Juma, \\"...in the dream-world a person sees the truth more clearly than in real life.\\" Kitaru reveals he has been having bad thoughts ever since rehearsing the play. He describes a dream in which he sprouted feathers that soon turned into wings. Kitaru saw the feathers as a positive until terror set in and the feathers wouldn't disappear, even when he tried picking them out. Kitaru also reveals that Juma has been present in his dreams, assuming the form of a doctor and dispersed laughter. Kitaru asks Juma if they can rehearse the play again, and after some hesitation, Juma agrees. Scene two takes place in the dark amidst the baobab tree. For this rehearsal, Kitaru demands to play the devil. Juma refuses, and the two get into a physical fight. Juma believes he and Kitaru can no longer see each other, arguing, \\"A person climbing a ladder and a person coming down a ladder can't shake hands.\\" The play ends with Kitaru calling after Juma and then silence. == Characters == Devil, Man, Kitaru, Mama Kitaru (Kitaru's mother) Baba Kitaru (Kitaru's father), Mfaume (their servant), Doctor, Juma, Mama Juma (Juma's mother), Baba Juma (Juma's father), Grandmother (Juma's grandmother), waiters (x2), customers (x2). == Context == Mashetani is set in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania at the end of 1966, before the Arusha Declaration. The Arusha Declaration was declared in 1967 by the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU). It was called the Policy on Socialism and Self Reliance and is a Tanzanian statement of African Socialism which exhorted the ideology and practice among the country's citizens. The play takes place before the Declaration, during a time of conflict and opposing ideas, which is reflected in the title, themes and symbolism, plot, and characters of Mashetani. Throughout the play, Kitaru comes face to face with the capitalism that surrounds him, in juxtaposition to the socialist ideals with which he begins to align himself. The introduction of the play describes the impact the nearby country of Zanzibar had on the ideological conflict in Tanzania. According to the introduction, in 1964, the last Sultan of Zanzibar and the Zanzibari Government were overthrown, causing Abedi Karume and the Afro Shirazi Party to take control. Karume and the new socialist government in Zanzibar seized land from larger farm owners and gave it to the people. The families whose land was taken resettled on the East African coast in countries like Tanzania. Juma, Kitaru's friend in the play, is among the population to be displaced from Zanzibar. Karume had formed a union with Julius Nyerere, the Tanganyikan president, to ensure the country that would become Tanzania would not align with the Soviet Union and become communist. Dar es Salaam at the time was encouraging black intellectuals, especially those educated in a Western/European style to hold positions in the Tanganyikan government. But these people created a plutocracy because of how they had been educated. Kitaru's family is counted among these people. Much of the conflict in and surrounding their friendship is reflective of the conflict that occurred in ideology when the Zanzibari people emigrated to East African countries. Kitaru and Juma are both struggling against old practices of capitalism and faced with impending socialist practices and views. Where Kitaru is driven by economics and politics, Juma is dealing with what he and his family lost. Similarly to how the Zanzibari and Tanganyikan peoples had to define their relationship as cohabitants, Kitaru and Juma, though friends, had to discover the meaning of their relationship throughout the play. Hussein describes the fight between Juma and Kitaru not as individual, but as a \\"class conflict.\\" Juma's family has lost wealth, while Kitaru's family is finding it, all on the brink of a declaration that will try to level the socioeconomic playing field through enforced socialism. == Symbols and Themes == === Laughter === Sound is a recurring device that Hussein uses throughout the play. It's worthy noting when Hussein uses silence and when he uses laughter. The laughter is introduced in the stage directions on page 9, \\"The DEVIL laughs. The MAN follows along. The DEVIL stops laughing suddenly. The MAN stops laughing with him, just as suddenly. The DEVIL starts laughing again, and now his laughter is threatening. Then suddenly he is transformed: he is gentle, meek – a humble man.\\" === Birds === There are a couple references to birds throughout the play. One significant reference occurs on page 7, when the devil says, \\"All right. I have changed myself into a bird. Just like that, I can be wind, and be everywhere.\\" Another important reference takes place in act four, page 55. As Kitaru reveals his dream to Juma, he mentions the feathers he was unable to pluck from himself, \\"Me – I remembered – I started to feel scared. I started to pull out my feathers. But every time I pulled a feather out, others sprouted. They suffocated me. Others sprouted – bigger and stronger than the old ones. I started to get worried – really worried: was I a person or a bird?\\" === Cars === Cars are a symbol of status and represent newborn wealth in this play. When Baba Kitaru comes home with a new car on page 27, Mama Kitaru exclaims, \\"A new car! A Benz!\\" Baba Kitaru responds with, \\"Mine! Yes! My own property, the sweat off my brow.\\" Customer one also references a car as a symbol of status in Act three, page 49, \\"I’m telling you, man, there’s nothing that makes me happier than seeing my pal doing well. If I see an African with a car, riding around, and a house – and I don’t mean a hut. No. When I say ‘house’, I mean a house. A civilized place – with a garden and carpets...that sort of thing. Hey, then my soul is completely happy.\\" === The fish and the boat === Kitaru mentions a story that involves a fish and a boat on page 34, \\"The story of the fish. Far, far away – if you cross the seven seas – there’s a big fish. If this fish takes a breath, all the water’s gone – all the water goes in his mouth. From where he is, he can suck in any boat he wants and swallow it. The boat will just be pulled along by the current of the water – if it wants to or if it doesn’t. And this fish isn’t a fish but a devil.\\" A boat was previously mentioned on page 26 as well, \\"Okay, what if the current is pulling to one side, and the captain wants the boat to go in another direction?\\" Category:African plays ","title":"Mashetani"},{"id":"60381459","text":"\\"Stupid Piece of Sh*t\\" is the sixth episode of the fourth season of American animated television series BoJack Horseman.

The variety of his landscapes diminished after 1870, when he began devoting himself almost entirely to fjords. This was probably in response to the preferences of the tourist trade. They were especially popular in Germany. In 1899 he moved to Berlin, but returned to Norway every summer to sell his paintings. After 1900, he turned to painting with a palette knife and brightened his colors, in imitation of Adelsteen Normann. His paintings always included foregrounds with people and boats; occasionally houses. Many of his works were copied and sold as prints. Some art historians maintain that he would be better known today if he had become a member of the Berlin Secession. His works may be seen at the National Gallery of Denmark, the Deutschen Schifffahrtsmuseum in Bremerhaven, the Gemäldegalerie Dresden and the Kunstmuseum Düsseldorf.

He was also a noted sinologist and pioneer Tangutologist who published one of the first studies of the Tangut script in 1898. ==Biography== Devéria was born in Paris on 8 March 1844 to a family of artists. His father was Achille Devéria (1800–1857), a renowned painter and lithographer, and his uncle was the Romantic painter Eugène Devéria (1805–1865). His mother Céleste, who married his father in 1829, was the daughter of a lithographic printer, Charles-Etienne Motte (1785–1836). He was one of six children, including Théodule Devéria (1831–1871), who became a photographer and Egyptologist. After the death of his father in 1857, when he only thirteen years old, his older brother Théodule took responsibility for his education. In February 1860, aged only sixteen, Gabriel Devéria was recruited as a student-interpreter in Chinese for a new School of Interpreters that the French government wanted to set up in China. In September of the same year he embarked on a ship bound for Tianjin in China, and arrived in China towards the end of the Second Opium War, when the United Kingdom and the French Empire had joined together in an attempt to force the Qing government to open up to trade with Europeans. Devéria studied his trade at the French Consulate in Tianjin for several years, and between 1863 and 1869 he acted as an interpreter for the negotiation of treaties between China and Spain and Italy. In February 1870 he was promoted to the position of Chancellor at the French mission in Fuzhou. Following the Tianjin Massacre in 1870, a Chinese mission of apology set sail to France, under Imperial Commissioner Chonghou, and Devéria was appointed to accompany the embassy as an interpreter. This was his first trip back to France, and when he arrived in Marseille he found his way to Paris impeded by the Franco-Prussian War. After the war ended on 28 January 1871, Devéria managed to reach to Paris, only to find that his brother Théodule had died a few days earlier. When Devéria returned to Paris in 1873, he was appointed First Interpreter to the French Legation in Beijing. Under the pseudonym T. Choutzé (朱茨), he published his first book in 1876, an account of his travels in the north of China (Pékin et le nord de la Chine). During the following years he concentrated on the study of Annam, publishing a geographic and ethnographic description of Annam in 1886, and an account of the relations between China and Annam two years later. In 1876 Devéria married Charlotte Thomas, niece of the French composer Ambroise Thomas, who was an accomplished pianist and composer. She also wrote a series of articles about music in China, published in Magasin Pittoresque in 1885. She died in the same year, leaving a son born in 1892. Later in his career, Devéria turned his attention to the study of the languages and epigraphic inscriptions left behind by the Jurchens and Tanguts. He made rubbings of the polyglot inscriptions at the Cloud Platform at Juyong Pass, which he provided to Prince Roland Napoléon Bonaparte who published them in his Documents de l'époque Mongole des XIII et XIV siècles (1895). In 1896 he published a history of the Bureau of Interpreters (會同館) which had been founded in the 15th century to enable communication between the Ming dynasty government and embassies and missions to China. During the latter half of the 1890s Devéria became interested in the spread of foreign religions in China and the Far East, such as Islam and Manichaeism. Devéria's final works were two pioneering studies of the Tangut script, mainly based on the bilingual Chinese-Tangut inscription on a stele at the Huguo Temple (護國寺) in Wuwei, Gansu. In the winter of 1898 he suffered a severe bout of Pleurisy, and the following summer he went to the resort of Mont-Dore to try to restore his health at the thermal springs, but on 12 July 1899 he suffered a hemorrhage and died. ==Diplomatic career== Devéria was promoted to Interpreter 1st Class in 1880, Consul 2nd Class in 1880, Secretary 2nd Class in 1881, Secretary Interpreter in 1882, Secretary 1st Class in 1883, and finally Consul General in 1888. ==Academic career== In 1889 Devéria was named Professor of Chinese at the School of Living Oriental Languages (École des Langues orientales vivantes) in Paris. ==Honours== In 1876 Devéria was made a Chevalier of the Légion d'honneur, and twenty years later, in 1896, he was promoted to Officier. In 1888 he was awarded the Prix Stanislas Julien for his book La frontière sino-annamite. In 1896 he was elected to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, in place of Edmond Le Blant. ==Works== * 1898. \\"L'Écriture du Royaume de Si-Hia ou Tangout\\". Paris: C.

Binnenvaartcentrum collects documents relating to inland shipping in the Netherlands and elsewhere. The museum is centered around René Siegfried, a decommissioned pusher boat (, a type of working vessel used on inland waterways). René Siegfried was built in 1963 by De Biesbosch for the Strasbourg-based (CNFR). In its day, it was one of the most powerful pusher boats on the River Rhine (which is a major European waterway). It had a crew of 11, later reduced to 9. In 1989, it was taken out of service because of overcapacity in the industry. It was saved from being scrapped, its engines were removed, and it was converted into a floating restaurant containing items of historical interest, moored on the Rhine at Nierstein in southern Germany. In 2004, it was put on the market for sale; and the vereniging bought it, took it to the Netherlands, and refurbished it as a museum. It has been added to the Dutch Nationaal Register Mobiel Erfgoed ('National Register of Moveable Heritage'). In 2008, the vereniging acquired a decommissioned Rhine LASH carrier (registration number CG S 6013), and installed it as an extension to the museum. It is an example of one of the types of unpowered cargo carrier which René Siegfried would have pushed. In 2018, the vereniging acquired the French-built riverboat Marot, and added it to their collection. Marot is a surviving example of a Fransemotor ('French motor boat'), one of several such boats built during the postwar years under the Marshall Plan to help European recovery. It was fitted out in 1953 at De Biesbosch as a Rhine working riverboat. It was in service for 65 years (in 1970, it was renamed Jan van Voorst), and was retired in 2018.

In comparison to the original H-6, the fuselage was lengthened and the engines were rearranged to be carried in individual pods under the wings. Ferry range is increased to 8,100 km (with standard payload), and combat radius is increased to over 5,000 km (with nuclear payload).

Although not much is known about the cult surrounding Dea Gravida, votive terracotta statues have been found throughout the Mediterranean, most notably in Phoenicia and Cyprus. The figure differs from kourotrophic figures that hold babies and are not visibly pregnant. == Etymology == “Dea Gravida” is a name that has been applied to these types of figures by modern archaeologists that translates to “pregnant goddess”. The term gravida comes from the Latin word gravidus which is used to describe a woman who is pregnant. Tyria is a reference to Tyre, which was where many of these types of figures have been found. == Role in cult == The exact role in cult and the purpose of the votive figures is unclear. It has been suggested that the figures represent a mother/fertility goddess, sacred prostitutes, or were charms to protect women during pregnancy. Dea Gravida figures have occasionally been found together with a statue of a bearded male wearing an Atef crown. They may have together formed a divine couple, however, it is unclear exactly why they were together or who they are supposed to represent. The figure has been associated with Taweret, a protective Egyptian goddess of pregnancy and childbirth who was represented as a pregnant hippopotamus. It is possible that Astarte was associated with these figures, however, no definite evidence supports this connection. == Votive figures == A seated Cypriot example circa 600–480 B.C.E. (alt= The votive figures typically show a pregnant female goddesses or woman either seated or standing, often with a hand resting on her abdomen. These figures were made exclusively from terracotta and are typically small. Figures were often depicted as veiled with braided coiled hair pinned to either side of the head, which has led to misleading descriptions as the figures having a \\"cobra-hood\\" or \\"horns\\". A variant was found in Tripoli, showing the figure holding a cake offering. The figures were first made in the Levantine coast in the 8th century B.C.E. and became widespread during the 6th to 4th centuries with the earliest known examples in Cyprus appearing in the 6th century. Depictions of pregnancy and motherhood were uncommon in Near Eastern iconography, as fertility was typically indicated by naked female figures holding their breasts. The most numerous and finest come from Phoenician tombs near Akhziv near ancient Tyre. Some of these figurines are dedicated in Cyprus from the 6th to the 5th century. On Cyprus, large number of figures have only been found in the city-kingdoms of Kition, Lapethos and Amathous, where Phoenician language and culture was dominate. Within Kition, these figures have been found within two urban sanctuaries and on the acropolis of Amthous, where the principal sanctuary of Aphrodite Kypria is located. A single figure has also been found in a sanctuary in Chytri. Figures have also been found in Lakonia, the sanctuary of Eileithyia Inatia in Crete, and possibly at the sanctuary of Demeter at Corinth. Some of these figures may have had a function as an anatomical teaching model, as some have been found with a square hole in the abdomen where a model fetus was placed. An example of a Dea Gravida figure (National Museum of Denmark) The terracotta figures have been divided into three different groupings: those made by hand, those thrown on a potter's wheel, and those produced in a mold. The molded figurines had the greatest outside influence from other cultures. These are used to as votive figures in sanctuaries, as funerary offerings at cemeteries, and sometimes they have been found in the cargo of transport ships. ==Difference from kourotrophos== Dea Gravida is similar to kourotrophos figures. (, \\"child nurturer\\"). These figures typically presented as women or goddesses holding babies in their arms and they were sometimes shown nursing.Lampsas Giannis, Dictionary of the Ancient World (Lexiko tou Archaiou Kosmou), Vol. III, Athens, Domi Publications, 1984, p. 247. However, some figures are show both pregnant and carrying a baby. Kourotrophos was also used to describe ancient Greek gods and goddesses whose properties included their ability to protect young people. Numerous gods were called by this adjective, including but not limited to Athena, Apollo, Hermes, Hecate, Aphrodite, Artemis, and Eileithyia. Kourotrophos was a major figure of cult, appearing in sacrifice groups connected with fertility and child care. ==Modern uses== Raphael's La donna gravida is a portrait of a pregnant woman with her hand resting on her abdomen. ==External references== Example of a figure from the British Museum ==References== Category:Archaeological discoveries in Cyprus Category:Archaeology of Lebanon Category:Tyre, Lebanon Category:Phoenician mythology ","title":"Dea Gravida"},{"id":"60382036","text":"The 1993 Dartmouth Big Green football team was an American football team that represented Dartmouth College in Ivy League during the 1993 NCAA Division I-AA football season.

In the West he is best known for his cameo appearances in several of the last films directed by Yasujirō Ozu. ==Business career== The son of a Kamakura railroad magnate, Sugawara became a real estate developer and industrialist, notably effecting the subdivision, improvement, and accessibility of Kamakurayama (the city's mountain district) as a high-end residential area in the 1930s. He bridged Ōfuna to the island of Enoshima with Japan's first toll road, and he developed and managed the region's Enoshima Electric Railway, which connects Kamakura with Fujisawa. He served as president of Japan's Construction Industry Association and was instrumental in the restoration that followed the Great Kantō Earthquake of 1923. A stone tablet near the Tsurugaoka Hachimangū shrine in Kamakura honors Sugawara for his contribution to the city's prosperity. ==Civic Activity== Sugawara's driving ambition, his passion for Japanese public policy, and his status as a “noted man of independent means” led to his lifelong reputation as an influential “fixer.” The American Political Science Review asserted in 1948 that Sugawara headed Japan's powerful “contractor syndicate” and provided “generous” financial support to multiple rival political parties because he “want[ed] railway contracts.” Among the politicians whose careers he cultivated was Shintaro Ishihara, a “disciple” of his who eventually became governor of Tokyo. As a backer of Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida, Sugawara became embroiled in the Showa Denko corruption scandal that drove Ashida from office in 1948. ==Social Reform Agenda== An active social reformer, Sugawara led a public crusade in postwar Japan against the “three vices” of prostitution, venereal disease, and narcotics abuse. His high-profile activities as founder and president of “The Society for the Banishment of the Three Evils” even included appearing in several crime films inspired by his campaign, three of which starred Sonny Chiba. In 1959, UPI reported a story about the plight of modern-day geisha that was culled from an article Sugawara had written for the magazine Bungei Shunju. Identified as a “financier, essayist, art connoisseur, and chairman of the council for the prevention of prostitution,” Sugawara decried that an estimated 27 percent of geisha were engaging in prostitution, a result of rising expenses associated with the lifestyle. (Citing the diminishing number and advancing average age of geisha in Japan, he also asserted that girls now “prefer[red] to become dancers, models, and cabaret and bar hostesses rather than start training in music and dancing at the age of seven or eight,” the traditional route required to become a full geisha by 18 or 19 years old.) Sugawara's top-level relationships enabled him to influence Japan's social policy also through direct appointments by Prime Ministers to various councils and committees. Working with Shiro Nabarro, a member of Japan's House of Representatives and Chairman of both the Labor Committee and the Cabinet Commission on Narcotics Problems, Sugawara implemented a four-part plan he devised to end the nation's “serious threat” of heroin abuse in the early 1970s: # To destroy the smuggling routes. # To make the penalties more severe, including life imprisonment. # To appeal to the general public for cooperation by enlightening them into the realization of the misery of narcotic addiction. # To commit narcotic addicts to treatment centers and cure them at government expense. The plan is credited with nearly eliminating the problem “in a very short time,” and as chairman of the Committee on Drug Abuse Control, which operated out of the Prime Minister's office, Sugawara served as a consultant to the U.S. government's National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse shortly thereafter. ==Cultural Legacy== Japanese National Treasures that he owned which are now held by the Tokiwayama Bunko Foundation. Sugawara's interpretation, also rendered as a hanging scroll, truncates the text and includes a self-portrait. The original, created in 1339 by Seisetsu Shōchō (Ch'ing-cho Cheng-ch'eng 清拙正澄), is a death verse that chronicles a large wave soaking the stars and deities as a rod-wielding temple guardian futilely tries to stop the end of the world by chasing after the lightning. Sugawara was an avid art collector, particularly of Japanese and Chinese antiquities, founding the Tokiwayama Bunko (Library) Foundation to hold and catalog his acquisitions, which the organization continues to display at museum exhibitions. His devotion to Japanese cultural preservation is also reflected in his numerous books and essays. A friend of Yasujirō Ozu, Sugawara appeared in seven of the director's last eight films, making him a ubiquitous presence in many of the most popular and accessible works of “one of the most influential and famous filmmakers in the history of Japanese cinema.” Beginning in Early Spring and excluding only The End of Summer, the brief roles enhance the movies’ historical resonance and cultural realism, featuring in-jokes such as social commentary by Sugawara or references to traits for which he was known, such as his business acumen or imposing personality. For example, in Good Morning, the Ozu film in which a viewer is most likely to infer that Sugawara is playing himself, he is asked at a bar to comment on journalist Sōichi Ōya's 1957 warning that television was part of a mass media campaign to turn Japan into “a nation of 100 million idiots.” Sugawara leans back and says, “Yes. TV sets are a nuisance.” In Tokyo Twilight, the only one to feature his character in multiple scenes, he muses over a newspaper article announcing the end of legal prostitution in Japan. Sugawara received a “special appearance” credit in Kurahara’s I Hate But Love (1962), briefly playing himself on a TV panel with star Yûjirô Ishihara, brother of his protege Shintaro Ishihara. == References == ==External links== * Category:1894 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Japanese male film actors ","title":"Tsûsai Sugawara"},{"id":"60382271","text":"Mario Bocaly is a Martiniquais football coach, currently manager of Martinique. ==Coaching career== In 2009, Bocaly was appointed manager of Réveil Sportif.

It emerged as a direct political goal around 1945 under the colonial mandate of French Togoland, however the ideal of unifying the group has been an identifiable sentiment present amongst the ethnicity's leadership and wider population ever since their initial colonial partitions by the British and German Empires from 1874 to 1884. While there have been many efforts to bring about unification, none have ultimately been successful due to both the platform itself often being a secondary concern for political leadership, or inter/intrastate conflicts overshadowing them.330x330px == Background == A loose conception of an Ewe identity has existed through a shared origin myth surrounding the Togolese town of Notsé and a subsequent exodus from it due to the tyranny of its king Agokoli, but historical evidence for this specific tradition's basis in reality is lacking. The more accepted version of their history follows the group's 1600s westward migration from the town of Ketu around the Benin-Nigeria border after pressures began to mount from the neighboring Yoruba. After settling in their current territories around the Volta Region, the Ewe were fragmented into a menagerie of chiefdoms and villages called dukowo, though they sometimes consolidated into military alliances against external threats such as the Akwamu in 1833, or Ashanti in 1868. While no fully unified Ewe character had consolidated at this point, because conflicts between different dukowo were common — such as those between the Anlo and Gen in the 1680s — Ewe nationalists eventually took advantage of the aforementioned shared traditions and moments of cooperation during the colonial period. === Early colonialism === British Gold Coast Colony Division of Togoland by British (Left) and French (Right)Ewe interaction with Europeans prior to colonization was primarily confined to trade along the Gold & Slave coasts and mouth of the Volta River. However, this changed once the British Empire began asserting itself in the region to establish its own west African colonial claims from 1850 to 1874. In accordance with this new colonial rush, the German Empire, too, established its own holdings along the coast in 1884, thus dividing the Ewe between two colonial powers. It was with this division that the Ewe identity began to become politically salient, as many within their leadership protested the consequent restriction of movement through what they had begun to see as a unified Ewe territory. ==== German missionaries ==== German Togoland Under German colonial rule, a common governing ethos was that of divide et impera, which sought to exacerbate their various colonial subjects' cultural identities against each other to prevent larger political units from forming against their imperial hegemony. This manifested itself in German Togoland with the pitting of the Ewe peoples against other more allegedly barbaric groups, like the Ashanti, by German Protestant priests from the Norddeutsche Missionsgesellschaft. Under the ethos, these priests translated the Protestant Bible into a standardized Ewe language, and utilized it and the resulting linguistic studies to consolidate a shared Ewe identity based around a common language to loosely unify their disparate polities further. === World War I and late colonialism === During the first World War, the Ewe in the British Gold Coast Colony actively supported their overlords in the Entente, while those in Togoland mostly withheld loyalty from their own colonizer, in the hopes that the defeat of the Germans would unify the Ewe peoples under one government. When the war ended, the British and French divided Togoland between themselves. This ultimately only served as a partial unification of some Ewe — for while many in the west now found themselves essentially unified under two British colonial administrations, the rest in the east were placed under a French mandate. This tripartite division between the Gold Coast Colony and British & French Togoland left many Ewe leaders dissatisfied, but voicing their concerns ultimately, having been brought by the Congress of British West Africa to British administrators for consideration in 1920, yielded no change. == Unification movements == Sylvanus Olympio, 1st President of Togo === In Togo === Around 1945, various members of Ewe and wider Togolese leadership began the construction of political organizations which sought to decolonize French Togo. These developed as the Comité de l'Unité Togolaise, led by Sylvanus Olympio, and the Mouvement la Jeunesse Togolaise. Both possessed political platforms that included the reunification of the separate British western and French eastern Togolands, and, for the Ewe, this implied a reunification of their eastern populations. After the Comité de l'Unité Togolaise began gaining power in the territory's Representative Assembly in 1946, French administrators, from 1950 onward, attempted to subvert the movement's gains by arresting or restricting its leadership, limiting its legal political status, and sowing rivalries with other Togolese political parties. Despite these efforts, however, the French administration began to lose favor with the Togolese population, and, coupled with mounting pressures from the neighboring and ever more autonomous British colonies, began a process of autonomy granting, which eventually altogether ended their trusteeship over the territory in 1956, giving Togo independence, and placing Sylvanus Olympio in power as Togo's first president. Sylvanus Olympio's eventual usurper, Gnassingbé Eyadéma, did not focus on his predecessor's greater Togoland claims in the initial period of his leadership. However, after internal pressures of Ewe separatism in Ghana resurfaced, Gnassingbé Eyadéma's regime reaffirmed the claims and publicly lauded the Ewe's goals. However, this reorientation towards irredentism was seemingly only rhetorical, as Gnassingbé Eyadéma's government was in practice cooperative with Ghana's efforts at suppressing the separatists due to Togo's heavy reliance on Ghanaian hydroelectric capacities. Kwameh Nkrumah, 1st President of Ghana === In Ghana === Like in Togo, political organizations such as the All Ewe Conference pursued the Ewe unification platform in the British colonies. Just the same, the British were antagonistic to the idea of granting them any special autonomy. In 1956, the British conducted a plebiscite in their Togoland mandate which resulted in the unification of it to the Gold Coast Colony. This drew opposition from many Ewe under the new administration, as while most of them supported the results, some instead still preferred to be reincorporated into a united Togoland — with this portion having been the primary support behind another unification party called the Togoland Congress. After Ghanaian independence, the country's first president, Kwame Nkrumah, supported Ewe unification by proxy, because he required their favor for his goal of a Ghanaian-led unification with Togo, which would consequently place the Ewe under one country's administration— though he was ultimately still opposed to a fully independent Ewe state. This created tensions with Sylvanus Olympio, as both leaders, thereafter, had claims over the other's territories, and this resulted in a more restrictive border between the two newly independent countries. This tension briefly subsided with the rise of Gnassingbé Eyadéma to power in Togo, because his regime was more cooperative with Ghana — at least until the 1970s, when he began agitating for Ewe separatism and suggesting border readjustments. ==== Tolimo ==== Proposed flag of Western TogolandIn 1976, an Ewe-led movement formed in Ghana's former British Togoland provinces that sought secession and reunification with Togo called the National Liberation Movement of Western Togoland, or Tolimo Movement, which stemmed from the Togoland Congress. While its secessionist sentiments developed originally due to the 1956 plebiscite, this iteration was spurred by alleged Ewe repression by Kwame Nkrumah due to the more restrictive border with Togo, along with the generally poorer conditions which were common amongst the Ghanaian Ewe populations during the time. It had support from Gnassingbé Eyadéma in Togo, though this was only an expressed public support, and ultimately nothing substantive. Following an attempted coup in 1975, which the Ewe were implicated in as having been its alleged primary backers, the Ghanaian government cracked down on Tolimo with a plan, Operation Counterpoint, that aimed to restrict cross-border Ewe travel. The organization was eventually outlawed officially in 1976. The Ghanaian Ewe, after their separatist movement was largely repressed, mostly shifted away from their secessionist tendencies towards more internal power-political competitions against other ethnic groups within Ghana, especially after Jerry Rawlings, who was half ethnic Ewe, seized the reins of power through a coup in 1979 and integrated many of them into the state apparatus. While separatist groups do still exist, most of their independence efforts have been effectively stunted by the Ghanaian government. == References == Category:Ewe people Category:West Africa Category:Nationalist movements in Africa Category:Stateless nationalism in Africa Category:Separatism in Africa Category:Ethnicity in politics Category:Ethnic nationalism ","title":"Ewe Unification Movement"},{"id":"60382722","text":"306 Hollywood is a 2018 documentary film directed by the brother-and-sister team of Jonathan and Elan Bogarín.

In a tribute to 926F, Rick McIntyre, a naturalist and former Yellowstone wolf researcher, wrote that \\"until the last moment of her life, no matter what challenges and tragedies she faced, she always figured out a way to survive, to carry on.\\" McIntyre described an incident in March 2015, in which 926F, who was pregnant, and Wolf 925 led their 11 month old pups into the territory of a rival pack in search of elk to hunt. After killing a cow elk and feeding their pups, 926F and Wolf 925 began to lead the pups back to their own territory, when they were spotted by the Prospect Peak Pack who began to chase them. Wolf 925 lured the Prospect Peak Pack away from other members of the Lamar Canyon Pack, and Wolf 925 was attacked and killed. 926F eventually joined with four members of the Prospect Peak Pack who helped raise her new pups. ==Death== 926F was shot and killed in late November 2018 when she crossed into Montana, between Silver Gate and Cooke City, Montana. She was reportedly near cabins when she was shot. After 926F's death, her daughters Little T and Dot were reported to be the alphas of the Lamar Canyon Pack. Doug Smith, Yellowstone's wolf biologist, was quoted in the New York Times as saying that \\"their survival is an open question.\\" Mary Cooke, president of Wolves of the Rockies, cited 926F's killing as an example of why the government should strengthen protection for wolves who venture out of Yellowstone into areas where they become legal targets for hunters. ==See also== * Yellowstone National Park * History of wolves in Yellowstone ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:2018 animal deaths Category:Individual wolves Category:Yellowstone National Park Category:2011 animal births ","title":"926F (Spitfire)"},{"id":"60382925","text":"Silvia Vasquez Lavado, Antarctica January 2016 Silvia Vasquez-Lavado (born 1974) is a Peruvian-American explorer, mountaineer, social entrepreneur and technologist.

It is one of the world's most remarkable examples of meandering in a river. The Mbhashe River rises in the mountains of the southern Drakensberg, and flows eastward across an undulating grassland coastal plateau until shortly after passing under national road N2, the river encounters southwest of Elliotdale and north-east of Dutywa the more rugged terrain of the Wild Coast and suddenly enters into a 64 km long series of violent twists and turns known as the Collywobbles before continuing more sedately to discharge into the Indian Ocean. In the area enclosed by the river's twists and turns, are the agricultural settlements of Msikiti, Zangcete, KuLombete and Mkhalalo. The area is named after Lt. George Pomeroy Colley who was a magistrate in the Idutywa District from 1858 to 1860. On an inspection visit, he came across this unique geographical phenomenon in the river and upon seeing the spectacular view before him, exclaimed \\"How that river wobbles!\\" \\"Yes sir\\", replied a quick witted aid, \\"in fact, it Colley Wobbles!\\". Collywobbles is an English word for a stomach upset. == Colley Wobbles power station == At one point on the river where it twists close together there is a dam in the northern bend from which water is diverted via a 1.4 km long tunnel to the Colley Wobbles hydro-electric power station in the southern bend to bypass the 34 km that the river meanders between the dam and the power station. The 42 MW power station was commissioned in 1985 by TESCOR, the former Transkei Electricity Corporation, and is now operated by Eskom. == Collywobbles vulture colony == The Collywobbles is home to an important colony of Cape vultures. The colony which has existed since the 1890s has been known to support up to 300 breeding pairs (1989), but on average it is typically about 200 breeding pairs across 13 separate cliffs where they build their nests, particularly on Main, mSikiti and Ledger cliffs. The vultures use the rural grasslands and woodland south of Mthatha, but rely on the high cliffs for breeding. The Collywobbles Vulture Colony has been designated as an Important Bird Area (IBA SA088) specifically to promote the conservation of this threatened species. ==References == == Further reading == * == External links == * Foraging range and habitat use by Cape Vulture Gyps coprotheres from the Msikaba colony, Eastern Cape province, South Africa * Collywobbles Vulture Colony Category:Geography of the Eastern Cape ","title":"Collywobbles (Mbhashe River)"},{"id":"60383156","text":"Ust-Chukurya () is a rural locality (a village) in Gaynskoye Rural Settlement, Gaynsky District, Perm Krai, Russia.

In the Ugandan creation myth, it is Nambi and her younger sister who discover Kintu, the first man. Nambi helps Kintu throughout his journey and trials, and eventually becomes his wife and mother of his children. Map of Uganda == Mythological character == The Ugandan creation story begins with Kintu, the first man, wandering Earth with only his possessions on him and his cow. For many days he wandered in Uganda alone, until suddenly, Nambi and her younger sister dropped down from heaven. Nambi is curious to see the man, unknowing who or what he is, nor what kind of creature his cow is. Kintu also sees the sisters, but instead of approaching them, keeps his distance. Nambi eventually approaches Kintu, asking what animal is with him and tells him that neither her or her sister had ever seen a man before. After their meeting, Nambi and her sister discuss the interaction. Nambi decides that Kintu is a man, and upon asking him if this is true, she is proved correct. Nambi shares to Kintu about herself and her sister and insists they all return to her father in heaven together. Kintu persists that his cow must be taken along, but Nambi declines, and the sisters return to heaven alone. When Nambi and her sister return to Mugulu, they tell him of their findings. Nambi tells her father that she would like to bring him up to heaven but Mugulu tells her that he will take care of the matter and dismisses her. Mugulu then tells his sons to go down to earth and to only retrieve the cow because he believed that Kintu would perish shortly anyway. Without his cow, his only source of food and drink, Kintu became angry and restless. The next day, Nambi saw only the cow in heaven and became very upset. She stated that the next day she will go down to heaven and bring Kintu to Mugulu. Nambi brings Kintu up to heaven and shows him all the resources and people they have in plenty. When Mugulu hears from his sons that Kintu had been brought to heaven, he begins setting up the first of many tasks he wants Kintu to accomplish. Kintu quickly completes his first task of eating an overabundance of food and impresses Mugulu. Mugulu then creates a second task for Kintu to accomplish and tells him if he does so, that he will have his cow back and will take Nambi's hand in marriage. After three more impossible tasks are completed by Kintu, Mugulu tells him to take Nambi and his cow and return to earth. Mugulu also packs them a bag of crops and one hen but warns them not to return to heaven, for they may encounter Nambi's evil brother, Warumbe. Nambi and Kintu set on their journey back to Uganda but discovered they had forgotten the millet to feed the hen. Ignoring Mugulu's wishes, Kintu sets back to heaven and when he arrives, comes across Warumbe who inquires about Nambi's whereabouts. Warumbre accompanies Kintu back to earth and they soon reunite with Nambi. Nambi insists that Warumbe return home to heaven, but eventually it is decided that he will live with them on earth for a short period of time. Nambi, Kintu, and Warumbe settle in Magongo, a part of Uganda, and Nambi begins growing the crops as they settle in. After some time Nambi and Kintu had three children, but Warumbe wants one of them to be his own to help him with daily tasks. Nambi and Kintu avoid his question, telling him that one day he will have one of them. Nambi continues having more children, and Warumbe grows upset because he still has no helper. Warumbe claims that day by day, he will kill one child until he feels that justice is served. Warumbe follows through on his proclamation, and each day, one of Kintu and Nambi's children dies. Kintu goes back to heaven to tell Mugulu their troubles. Mugulu explains that he had warned them about Warumbe but that he would send his son Kaikuzi down to earth to capture Warumbe. Warumbe and Kaikuzi begin to fight, but Warumbe quickly jumps into a hole in the ground, escaping Kaikuzi's every attempt to grasp him. Kaikuzi formulates a plan of two days of silence, claiming that Warumbe will come up from the ground to see why no one is making noise. Kaikuzi's plan works and he captures and Warumbe comes out in Tanda, a different area of Uganda. When he comes across children who scream when they notice his presence, breaking the silence. Kaikuzi, frustrated, states that he will no longer partake in bringing Warumbe back to Mugulu in heaven, and Warumbe remained in Uganda. == Historical figure == Nambi and Kintu in the Ugandan creation myth are rooted to Kato Kintu and Nambi Nantuttululu, historical figures from the fourteenth century Kingdom of Buganda. == Uses for modern reception == * Nambi is seen in The Quest for Kintu and the Search for Peace: Mythology and Morality in Nineteenth-Century Buganda, alongside her husband Kintu. It is said in this journal that in Nineteenth-century Buganda, political leaders tried to unite back the kingdom by re-telling the creation myth and reminding those living in Buganda of where their constitutional and social roots come from. At the time, there was strife between the kingdom and the issue of war versus peace was at the root of the problem. During the time of Kabaka Mutesa's rule, violence in the Kingdom of Buganda peaked. In a narrative recounted by Sir Apolo Kaggwa, once Kintu and Nambi returned home to Earth and Warumbe had established his residence with them as well, Kintu began creating political roles, geographical boundaries, and civil defense methods. It is after establishing these that Nambi is found to be having an affair in this version of the myth, and consequently Kintu disappears for many years, during which the Chwa dynasty take the throne. The Chwa dynasty are assumed to be directly related to Kintu and it is stated that their Kabaka's followed the same ruling styles that Kintu possessed. Political leaders in Uganda then took this story, and used it to challenge Kabaka Mutesa, stating that all Kabakas should rule as Kintu and Chwa did, and that the ideals they possessed, such as non-violence and compassion, should be passed on from ruler to ruler. * Nambi and other characters from the Bugandian creation story can be seen in \\"Kyazze Tekizzikayo- Short Ugandan Musical Film\\". This short film highlights and shows Nambi and Kintu's initial introduction, as well as their interactions with Warumbe, all told through musical styling. * == Other narratives of the Ugandan creation story == * In Kintu: The Myth, Nambi is the only daughter of Ggulu. Her and her brothers were playing on earth one day when they spotted him. While all of her brothers returned to heaven, she remained in Buganda to get to know Kintu better. After getting to know each other, they decided to marry one another and return to heaven to get Ggulu's approval. Ggulu creates tasks for Kintu to accomplish, and upon his completion of them, allows them to return to earth as man and wife. The rest of the myth follows as the one in Introduction to Mythology: Contemporary Approaches to Classical and World Myths. * In The Quest for Kintu and the Search for Peace: Mythology and Morality in Nineteenth-Century Buganda, a different narrative of the Ugandan creation story is accounted. In Sabadu's version of the myth, after Kintu completed the tasks set by Mugulu and Nambi and Kintu return to earth, Nambi bore two sons and two daughters every year who each came out of the womb fully grown. After many years, Buganda was filled with thriving people, animals, and plants. Kintu then cut off pieces of his personal banana and tuber tree and tells his descendants to make life elsewhere for themselves. However, Kintu and Nambi never warned those leaving to teach right from wrong or good from evil to their offspring, so many of the descendants became wicked and unjust. He then goes to Nambi, telling her that they must leave and travel elsewhere. Their sons searched for them day and night, but when they could not be found, Chwa assumed the throne, thus leading to the second Kabaka after Kintu who is historically recognized. This also marked the beginning of the long lineage of kings of Buganda, which is now on its 36th king, King Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II, whose lineage can be traced back to Kintu. * The Voice of Africa, a poem by Y.B. Lubambula recites a different narrative of how Kintu and Nambi initially meet. The poem begins with Kintu trapping different insects and animals, all of which he released after forming a blood-bond with them. One day, he comes to his trap and sees that instead of insects and animals, he has trapped a woman. The woman introduces herself as Nambi and requests a pole, a reed, and a blade of grass. The next day, a house had formed for the two of them. Nambi then plants a sweet-potato, which sprouted into many crops and grew rapidly. The next day, they find a cow eating the crops, so they trap it and domesticate it. A few days later, Kintu cannot find Nambi and one of the insects he had previously caught and formed a bond with informs him that they are up in Heaven.

Produced by Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment and Fox Star Studios, it is a spiritual sequel to Baaghi (2016) and Baaghi 2 (2018) and the third and final film in the Baaghi film series. The film stars Tiger Shroff, Riteish Deshmukh and Shraddha Kapoor. It is a remake of the 2012 Tamil- language film Vettai, the film follows Ronnie, a young man who protects his timid brother Vikram from bullies. He convinces Vikram to join the police force and works with him to take down criminals without exposing himself. When Vikram receives nationwide praise, he is sent for a mission to Syria where Ronnie sees him getting beaten up and kidnapped over a video call. This prompts him to head to Syria and rescue Vikram. The film co-stars Jaideep Ahlawat, Vijay Varma, Jameel Khoury and Ankita Lokhande. Disha Patani, who played the female lead in the previous film, makes a special appearance in the song \\"Do You Love Me\\". The action sequences were choreographed by Ram Chella, Lakshman Chella, and Kecha Khampadkee. Principal photography of the film began on 12 September 2019 in Mumbai. The makers wanted to shoot in Syria but the producers Fox Star Studios declined due to safety issues, due to which sets resembling the Syrian topography were built in Serbia. Baaghi 3 was theatrically released in India on 6 March 2020, receiving mixed reviews; the action sequences were praised while the writing was criticized. Despite a strong performance in its opening week, the film's collections were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as the theatres were shut down. There were plans for a re-release once the outbreak would end, but the makers instead decided to release it on digital platforms. Nevertheless, it became the second highest- grossing Bollywood film of 2020. ==Plot== Ranveer \\"Ronnie\\" Chaturvedi lives with his elder brother Vikram. Protective toward him since childhood, especially after their father's death, Ronnie is offered a job in the police force, but refuses due to his violent track record and convinces Vikram to take on the job. A timid and reluctant Vikram becomes a cop. When a hostage situation arises, Vikram is assigned the job and is terrified to face the criminals, but Ronnie accompanies him, fighting off the goons and helping rescue the hostages. He doesn't take the credit, and this process continues, with Vikram getting popular among the public and his department after each case. Ronnie and Siya fall in love and get their respective siblings Vikram and Ruchi married to each other. One day, Vikram is assigned to go for routine paperwork in Syria. Upon arriving, Vikram chats with Ronnie over video call but is suddenly kidnapped by a group of men who break into his home as Ronnie watches helplessly. Ronnie and Siya travel to Syria, where the police refuse to help them. They meet Akhtar Lahori, who helps them track Vikram and his captors. They go to Vikram's hotel while the cops start looking for the trio. In Vikram's room, Ronnie finds a damaged phone and escapes with Siya and Lahori before the cops can catch them. The trio finds the attacker, resulting in a chase. The exhausted attacker agrees to help before being hit by a truck and dying. Siya retrieves the attacker's phone and texts a goon named IPL to meet at a hotel. Abu Jalal Gaza, the mastermind, arrives to avenge his brother, the attacker's death. The main cop who supports Ronnie captures IPL while Abu escapes. Fearing betrayal from IPL since he's been arrested, Abu orders his men to take him down. Ronnie and the team cleverly stage a series of events that lead to Abu's henchmen believing they've been betrayed by IPL. They attack him, and upon being rescued by Ronnie, IPL decides to help him. Ronnie single-handedly battles Abu's army before going to rescue Vikram and the hostages. IPL sacrifices himself and Abu agrees to free everyone but captures Siya. Ronnie fights Abu's henchmen, but as Vikram starts getting enraged to see Ronnie being hit, Ronnie stops fighting back. He is stabbed and nearly killed, causing a transformation in Vikram, who jumps out of the cell and brutally fights off everyone, finally impaling Abu on steel rods. Vikram and Siya try to revive Ronnie, and as Abu emerges to attack them from behind, Ronnie wakes and kills him. Returning to India, Vikram is honored for his bravery while Ronnie imagines their father, a cop, saluting and hugging him for keeping his promise. == Cast == * Tiger Shroff as Ranveer \\"Ronnie\\" Chaturvedi * Riteish Deshmukh as Vikram Charan Chaturvedi * Shraddha Kapoor as Siya Nandan * Ankita Lokhande as Ruchi Nandan * Jameel Khoury as Abu Jalal Gaza, the chief of ISIS * Jaideep Ahlawat as IPL * Vijay Varma as Akhtar Lahori * Jackie Shroff as Inspector Charan Chaturvedi * Satish Kaushik as Police Commissioner BMC * Virendra Saxena as Kailash Tripathi * Ayaan Zubair Rahmani as Little Ronnie * Yash Bhojwani as Little Vikram * Ivan Kostadinov as Zaidi * Manav Gohil as Asif * Sunit Morarjee as Inspector Sharad Kute * Shriswara Dubey as Hafeeza * Amit Sharma as Bajwa * Danish Bhatt as Bilal * Shaurya Bharadwaj as Chacha Ji * Disha Patani in a special appearance in the song \\"Do You Love Me\\" == Production == The film was announced on 19 December 2018 with Tiger Shroff by Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment on their Twitter account by releasing a teaser poster.

The most consistent political force of this movement, the KPD, carried out from the first day of the fascist dictatorship, organized and, centrally directed the struggle against imperialism…The expression of the victory of the resolute anti-fascists after the smashing of fascism by the Soviet Union, and the other states of the Anti-Hitler coalition, and the defeat of German imperialism is the existence of the GDR in which the legacy of the best of the German people who gave their lives in the anti-fascist struggle was realized”. In West Germany, the first works to appear on the subject, such as the books by Hans Rothfels and Gerhard Ritter, were intended both to rebut the \\"collective guilt\\" accusations against the German people by showing the existence of the \\"other Germany\\", and to prevent another Dolchstoßlegende from emerging by portraying those involved in Widerstand activities in as heroic light as possible.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 186. Under the influence of the Cold War, starting in the late 1940s, and continuing throughout the 1950s, historiographical work on the subject in the Federal Republic came to increasing exclude the KPD, and assigned a minor role to the SPD. In his biography of Goerdeler, Ritter drew a distinction between those Germans working for the defeat of their country, and those Germans working to overthrow the Nazi regime while being loyal to Germany. Thus, in Ritter's view, Goerdeler was a patriot while those involved in the Rote Kapelle were traitors who deserved to be executed.Iggers, Georg The German Conception of History, Middletown: Connecticut; Wesleyan University Press, 1968 pages 258-259. In general, West German historians in the 1950s came to define Widerstand as only including national-conservatives involved in the July 20 plot, and a \\"monumentalization\\" and \\"heroicization\\" of Widerstand occurred with those being involved being credited as acting from the highest possible ethical and moral motives.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 187. In the 1950s, resistance was depicted as middle-class and Christian with the emphasis on the heroic individual standing alone against tyranny. Starting in the 1960s, a younger generation of West German historians such as Hans Mommsen started to provide a more critical assessment of Widerstand within German elites, and came to decry the \\"monumentalization\\" of the 1950s.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 pages 187-188. In two articles published in 1966, Mommsen proved the claim often advanced in the 1950s that the ideas behind \\"men of July 20\\" were the inspiration for the 1949 Basic Law of the Federal Republic was false.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 188. Mommsen showed that the ideas of national-conservative opponents of the Nazis had their origins in the anti-Weimar right of the 1920s, that the system the national-conservatives wished to build in place of Nazism was not a democracy, and that national- conservatives wished to see a \\"Greater Germany\\" ruling over much of Central and Eastern Europe.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 pages 188-189. As part of a critical evaluation of those involved in anti-Nazi work, the German historian Christof Dipper in his 1983 essay \\"Der Deutsche Widerstand und die Juden\\" (translated into English as \\"The German Resistance and the Jews\\") argued that the majority of the anti-Nazi national-conservatives were anti- Semitic.Marrus, Michael The Holocaust In History, Toronto: Key Porter 2000 page 92. Dipper wrote that for the majority of the national-conservatives \\"the bureaucratic, pseudo-legal deprivation of the Jews practiced until 1938 was still considered acceptable\\" Though Dipper noted no-one in the Widerstand movement supported the Holocaust, he also commented that the national- conservatives did not intend to restore civil rights to the Jews after the overthrow of Hitler Dipper went on to argue that based on such views held by opponents of the regime that for \\"a large part of the German people...believed that a \\"Jewish Question\\" existed and had to be solved...\\". In response to Dipper's charges, the Canadian historian Peter Hoffmann in his 2004 essay \\"The German Resistance and the Holocaust\\" sought to disapprove Dipper's thesis. Hoffmann argued that the majority of those involved in the July 20th putsch attempt were motivated in large part to moral objections to the Shoah.Hoffmann, Peter \\"The German Resistance and the Holocaust\\" pages 105–126 from Confront! edited by John J. Michalczyk, New York: Peter Lang Publishers, 2004 pages 115–118. In particular, Hoffmann used the example of Claus von Stauffenberg's moral outrage to witnessing the massacre of Russian Jews in 1942, and of Carl Friedrich Goerdeler's advice in 1938–39 to his contact with British intelligence, the industrialist A.P. Young that the British government should take a tough line with the Nazi regime in regards to its anti- Semitism.Hoffmann, Peter \\"The German Resistance and the Holocaust\\" pages 105–126 from Confront! edited by John J. Michalczyk, New York: Peter Lang Publishers, 2004 pages 109–110 & 115 The Israeli historian Danny Orbach in his 2010 book Valkyrie: Hahitnagdut Hagermanit Lehitler defended the German resistance fighters, particularly Goerdeler, against the charge that they were anti-Semitic by noting Goerdeler's strong support for Zionism, the importance of the Holocaust in the motives of the National-Conservative resistance, as well as attempts of other German resistance fighters to save persecuted Jews.Segev, Tom (April 2, 2010). \\"The Good Germans\\". Haaretz. Retrieved 2011-09-08. In a recent article, Orbach also argued that Dipper's accusations of antisemitism are based on a misreading, if not distortion, of the primary sources, above all Goerdeler's memoranda on the Jewish Question.Danny Orbach, \\"Criticism Reconsidered: The German Resistance to Hitler in Critical German Scholarship\\", Journal of Military History 75:2 (April, 2011) Increasingly, West German historians started in the 1960s and 1970s to examine Widerstand outside of elites, and by focusing on resistance by ordinary people to challenge the popular notion that had been \\"resistance without the people\\".Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 190. An example of the changing trend in historical research was a series of local studies of varying degrees of quality on working-class resistance movements associated with the SPD and the KPD published in the 1970s, which shed much light on these previously little known movements.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 pages 190-191. As the historical genre of Alltagsgeschichte (history of everyday life) started to enjoy increasing popularity as a research topic in the 1970s-80s, historians became more preoccupied with that they considered to be \\"everyday\\" resistance by individuals acting outside of any sort of organization\\".Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 pages 191-192. The so-called \\"Bavaria Project\\" of the 1970s, an effort made by the Institute of Contemporary History to comprehensively document \\"everyday life\\" in Bavaria during the Third Reich did much to spur research into this area.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 192. The first director of the \\"Bavaria Project\\", Peter Hüttenberger defined Widerstand as \\"every form of rebellion against at least potentially total rule within the context of asymmetrical relations of rule\\". For Hüttenberger, \\"symmetrical\\" rule occurs when there is a \\"bargain\\" struck between the different interests of the rulers and ruled which leads more or less to a \\"balance\\"; \\"asymmetrical rule\\" occurs when there is no \\"bargain\\" and the state seeks total Herrschaft (domination) over the ruled.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 pages 192-193. For this reason, Hüttenberger discounted the East German claim that the KPD had been engaging in anti-Nazi resistance during the Weimar Republic. Hüttenberger argued that democracy is a form of \\"symmetrical\\" rule, and therefore merely being an opposition party under a democracy does not qualify as resistance. Seen within this perspective as defined by Hüttenberger, any effort made to resist the claim of total Herrschaft, no matter how minor was a form of Widerstand.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 193. Thus, the six volumes which comprised the \\"Bavaria Project\\" edited by the project's second director, Martin Broszat depicted actions such as refusal to give the Nazi salute or regularly attending church as a type of resistance. Moreover, the emphasis upon resistance in \\"everyday life\\" in the \\"Bavaria Project\\" portrayed Widerstand not as a total contrast between black and white, but rather in shades of grey, noting that people who often refused to behave as the Nazi regime wanted in one area often conformed in other areas; as an example the Bavarian peasants who did business with Jewish cattle dealers in the 1930s despite the efforts of the Nazi regime to stop these transactions otherwise often expressed approval of the anti-Semitic laws. Rather than defining resistance as a matter of intention, Broszat and his associates came to define Widerstand as a matter of Wirkung (effect) as a means of blocking the Nazi regime's total claim to control all aspects of German life, regardless of whether the intentions were political or not.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 194. Realizing that not every action that blocked the Nazi regime's total claims should be considered a form of Widerstand, Broszat devised the controversial concept of Resistenz (immunity). By Resistenz, Broszat meant that certain sections of German society were reasonably able to maintain their pre-1933 value system without seeking to fundamentally challenge the Nazi regime. The Resistenz concept was often criticized by other historians for seeking to change the focus from \\"behavior\\" and intentions towards the Nazi regime towards the \\"effect\\" on one's actions on the regime.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 195. One of Broszat's leading critics, the Swiss historian Walter Hofer commented that in his view: \\"The concept of Resistenz leads to a levelling down of fundamental resistance against the system on the one hand and actions criticizing more or less accidental, superficial manifestations on the other: the tyrannicide appears on the same plane as the illegal cattle-slaughterer\\". Moreover, Hofter noted that the things that Broszat labeled Resistenz had no effect within the grander scheme of things on the ability of the Nazi regime to accomplish its objectives within Germany. Another of Broszat's critics, the German historian Klaus-Jürgen Müller argued that the term Widerstand should apply only to those having a \\"will to overcome the system\\" and that Broszat's Resistenz concept did too much to muddy the waters between by speaking of societal \\"immunity\\" to the regime. A more sympathetic appraisal of the Resistenz concept came from the historians Manfred Messerschmidt and Heinz Boberach who argued that Widerstand should be defined from the viewpoint of the Nazi state, and any activity that was contrary to the regime's wishes, such as listerning to jazz music, should be considered as a form of Widerstand.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 pages 195-196. Hans Mommsen wrote about the Resistenz concept that: > \\"This raises, of course, the issue of how to distinguish between resistance > that intended to overthrow the system, and active Resistenz (though judged > from the angle of convictions of the individual, this constitutes an > artificial separation). Those who risked their lives to hide Jewish fellow > citizens and acquire forged exit permits for them, those who tried to help > Russian prisoners-of-war, those who, at their workplaces, fought for the > rights of workers and refused to be indoctrinated by the German Labour > Front, those who protested against the treatment of the Jewish population or > publicly denounced the euthanasia programme, those who refused to obey > criminal orders, those who as a powerless protest against Nazi war policies > daubed slogans on walls at night-time, those who protected the persecuted > and shared their ration cards with them-in a wider sense they all belonged > to the resistance\\".Mommsen, Hans \\"German Society and Resistance Against > Hitler\\" pages 253-274 from The Third Reich The Essential Readings edited by > Christian Leitz, Blackwell: London 1999 page 267 Another viewpoint advanced in the debate was that of Mommsen, who cautioned against the use of overtly rigid terminology, and spoke of a wide type of \\"resistance practice\\" (Widerstandspraxis), by which he meant that there were different types and forms of resistance, and that resistance should be considered a \\"process\\", in which individuals came to increasingly reject the Nazi system in its entirety.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 196. As an example of resistance as a \\"process\\", Mommsen used the example of Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, who initially supported the Nazis, became increasing disillusioned over Nazi economic policies while serving as Price Commissioner in the mid-1930s, and by the late 1930s was committed to Hitler's overthrow. Mommsen described national-conservative resistance as \\"a resistance of servants of the state\\", who, over time, came to gradually abandon their former support of the regime, and instead steadily came to accept that the only way of bringing about fundamental change was to seek the regime's destruction.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 197. In regards to the idea of \\"resistance as a process\\", several historians have worked out typologies. The German historian Detlev Peukert created a typology running from \\"nonconformity\\" (mostly done in private and not including total rejection of the Nazi system), \\"refusal of co-operation\\" (Verweigerung), \\"protest\\", and finally, \\"resistance\\" (those committed to the overthrow of the regime).Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 205. The Austrian historian Gerhard Botz argued for a typology starting with \\"deviant behavior\\" (minor acts of non-conformity), \\"social protest\\", and \\"political resistance\\". The British historian Sir Ian Kershaw has argued that there are two approaches to the Widerstand question, one of which he calls the fundamentalist (dealing with those committed to overthrowing the Nazi regime) and the societal (dealing with forms of dissent in \\"everyday life\\").Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 198 In Kershaw's viewpoint, the Resistenz concept works well in an Alltagsgeschichte approach, but works less well in the field of high politics, and moreover by focusing only on the \\"effect\\" of one's actions, fails to consider the crucial element of the \\"intention\\" behind one's actions.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 pages 198-199 Kershaw has argued that the term Widerstand should be used only for those working for the total overthrow of the Nazi system, and those engaging in behavior which was counter to the regime's wishes without seeking to overthrow the regime should be included under the terms opposition and dissent, depending upon their motives and actions.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 pages 206-207. Kershaw has used the Edelweiss Pirates as an example of whose behavior initially fell under dissent, and who advanced from there to opposition and finally to resistance.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 204. Similarly, the American historian Claudia Koonz in her 1992 article \\"Ethical Dilemmas and Nazi Eugenics”, argued that those who protested against the Action T4 program, usually for religious reasons while remaining silent about the Holocaust cannot be considered as part of any resistance to the Nazis, and these protests can only be considered as a form of dissent.Koonz, Claudia \\"Ethical Dilemmas and Nazi Eugenics: Single-Issue Dissent in Religious Contexts\\" pages S8–S31 from Journal of Modern History, Volume 64, 1992. In Kershaw's opinion, there were three bands ranging from dissent to opposition to resistance.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 207. In Kershaw's view, there was much dissent and opposition within German society, but outside of the working-class, very little resistance.Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 pages 207-216. Though Kershaw has argued that the Resistenz concept has much merit, overall he concluded that the Nazi regime had a broad basis of support and consensus, and it is correct to speak of \\"resistance without the people\\".Kershaw, Ian The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation, London: Arnold Press, 2000 pages 215-217. > \\"You Did Not Bear The Shame, You Resisted, Sacrificing Your Life For > Freedom, Justice and Honor.\\" > -From the German Resistance Memorial, Berlin ==See also== *German resistance to Nazism ==References== Category:Historians of Nazism Category:Historiography of Germany Category:Vergangenheitsbewältigung ","title":"Historiography of German resistance to Nazism"},{"id":"60383621","text":"Yorkshire Island is a small island in the east end of Lake Ontario, off Prince Edward County.

They seem to have developed from the 4th millennium BCE, starting in the Uruk period for Mesopotamia and the Gerzean culture of Prehistoric Egypt (circa 3500–3200 BCE).Shaw, Ian. & Nicholson, Paul, The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, (London: British Museum Press, 1995), p. 109. Influences can be seen in the visual arts of Egypt, in imported products, and also in the possible transfer of writing from Mesopotamia to Egypt and generated \\"deep-seated\\" parallels in the early stages of both cultures. ==Influences on Egyptian trade and art (3500–3200 BCE)== There was generally a high-level of trade between Ancient Egypt and the Near East throughout the Pre-dynastic period of Egypt, during the Naqada II (3600–3350 BCE) and Naqada III (3350–2950 BCE) phases. These were contemporary with the Late Uruk (3500-3100 BCE) and Jemdet Nasr (3100–2900 BCE) periods in Mesopotamia. The main period of cultural exchange, particularly consisting in the transfer of Mesopotamian imagery and symbols to Egypt, is considered to have lasted about 250 years, during the Naqada II to Dynasty I periods. ===Designs and objects=== Distinctly foreign objects and art forms entered Egypt during this period, indicating contacts with several parts of Asia. The designs that were emulated by Egyptian artists are numerous: the Uruk \\"priest- king\\" with his tunique and brimmed hat in the posture of the Master of animals, the serpopards or sepo-felines, winged griffins, snakes around rosettes, boats with high prows, all characteristic of Mesopotamian art of the Late Uruk (Uruk IV, c. 3350–3200 BCE) period. The same \\"Priest-King\\" in visible in several Mesopotamian works of art of the end of the Uruk period, such as the Blau Monuments, cylinder seals and statues. Objects such as the Gebel el-Arak knife handle, which has patently Mesopotamian relief carvings on it, have been found in Egypt, and the silver which appears in this period can only have been obtained from Asia Minor.Redford, Donald B. Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times. (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 16. ====Mesopotamian-style pottery in Egypt (3500 BCE)==== Evolution of Egyptian prehistoric pottery styles, from Naqada I to Naqada II and Naqada III, with Mesopotamian-style Naqada II straight-spouted jars circa 3500 BCE. Red-slipped spouted potteries dating to around 3500 BCE (Naqada II C/D), which were probably used for pouring water, beer or wine, suggest that Egypt was in contact with Mesopotamia around that time. This type of pottery was manufactured in Egypt, with Egyptian clay, but its shape, particularly the spout, is Mesopotamian in origin. Such vessels were novel in pre-Dynastic Egypt, but were commonly manufactured in the cities of Nippur and Uruk. This indicated that Egyptians were familiar with Mesopotamian types of potteries. The discovery of these vessels initially encouraged the development of the Dynastic race theory, according to which Mesopotamians would have established the first Pharaonic line, but is now considered to be simply indicative of cultural contacts and borrowings circa 3500 BCE. Spouted jars of Mesopotamian design start to appear in Egypt in the Naqada II period. Various Uruk pottery vases and containers have been found in Egypt in Naqada contexts, confirming that Mesopotamian finished goods were imported into Egypt, although the past content of the jars has not been determined yet. Scientific analysis of ancient wine jars in Abydos has shown there was some high-volume wine trade with the Levant during this period. ====Adoption of Mesopotamian-style maceheads==== Egyptians used traditional disk-shaped maceheads during the early phase of Naqada culture, circa 4000-3400 BCE. At the end of the period, the disk-shaped macehead was replaced by the superior Mesopotamian-style pear- shaped macehead as seen on the Narmer Palette. The Mesopotamian macehead was much heavier with a wider impact surface, and was capable of giving much more damaging blows than the original Egyptian disk-shaped macehead. ====Cylinder seals==== It is generally thought that cylinder seals were introduced from Mesopotamia to Egypt during the Naqada II period. Cylinder seals, some coming from Mesopotamia and Elam, and some made locally in Egypt following Mesopotamian designs in a stylized manner, have been discovered in the tombs of Upper Egypt dating to Naqada II and III, particularly in Hierakonpolis. Mesopotamia cylinder seals have been found in the Gerzean context of Naqada II, in Naqada and Hiw, attesting to the expansion of the Jemdet Nasr culture as far as Egypt at the end of the 4th millennium BCE. In Egypt, cylinder seals suddenly appear without local antecedents from around Naqada II c-d (3500-3300 BCE). The designs are similar to those of Mesopotamia, where they were invented during the early 4th millennium BCE, during the Uruk period, as an evolutionary step from various accounting systems and seals going back as early as the 7th millennium BCE. The earliest Egyptian cylinder seals are clearly similar to contemporary Uruk seals down to Naqada II-d (circa 3300 BCE), and may even have been manufactured by Mesopotamian craftsman, but they start to diverge from circa 3300 BCE to become more Egyptian in character. Cylinder seals were made in Egypt as late as the Second Intermediate Period, but they were essentially replaced by scarabs from the time of the Middle Kingdom. ====Other objects and designs==== Lapis Lazuli was imported in great quantity by Egypt, and already used in many tombs of the Naqada II period. Lapis Lazuli probably originated in northern Afghanistan, as no other sources are known, and had to be transported across the Iranian plateau to Mesapotamia, and then Egypt. In addition, Egyptian objects were created which clearly mimic Mesopotamian forms, although not slavishly.Redford, Donald B. Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times. (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 18. Cylinder seals appear in Egypt, as well as recessed paneling architecture, the Egyptian reliefs on cosmetic palettes are clearly made in the same style as the contemporary Mesopotamian Uruk culture, and the ceremonial mace heads which turn up from the late Gerzean and early Semainean are crafted in the Mesopotamian \\"pear-shaped\\" style, instead of the Egyptian native style.Redford, Donald B. Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times. (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 17. The first man/animal composite creatures in Egypt were directly copied from Mesopotamian designs. It is also considered as certain that the Egyptians adopted from Mesopotamia the practice of marking the sealing of jars with engraved cylinder seals for informational purposes. ===Temples and pyramids=== Egyptian architecture also was influenced, as it adopted element of Mesopotamian Temple and civic architecture. Recessed niches in particular, which are characteristic of Mesopotamian Temple architecture, were adopted for the design of false doors in the tombs of the First Dynasty and Second Dynasty, from the time of the Naqada III period (circa 3000 BCE). It is unknown is the transfer of this design was the result of Mesopotamian workmen in Egypt, or if temple designs on imported Mesopotamian seals may have been a sufficient source of inspiration for Egyptian architects. The design of the ziggurat was probably a precursor to that of the Egyptian pyramids, the earliest of which dates to circa 2600 BCE. ===Transmission=== The route of this trade is difficult to determine, but contact with Canaan does not predate the early dynastic, so it is usually assumed to have been by sea trade.Redford, Donald B. Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times. (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 22. During the time when the Dynastic Race Theory was still popular, it was theorized that Uruk sailors circumnavigated Arabia, but a Mediterranean route, probably by middlemen through Byblos, is more likely, as evidenced by the presence of Byblian objects in Egypt. Glyptic art also seems to have played a key role, through the circulation of decorated cylinder seals across the Levant, a common hinterland of both empire. The intensity of the exchanges suggest however that the contacts between Egypt and Mesopotamia were often direct, rather than merely through middlemen or through trade. Uruk had known colonial outposts of as far as Habuba Kabira, in modern Syria, insuring their presence in the Levant. Numerous Uruk cylinder seals have also been uncovered there. There were suggestions that Uruk may have had an outpost and a form of colonial presence in northern Egypt. The site of Buto in particular was suggested, but it has been rejected as a possible candidate. The fact that so many Gerzean sites are at the mouths of wadis which lead to the Red Sea may indicate some amount of trade via the Red Sea (though Byblian trade potentially could have crossed the Sinai and then be taken to the Red Sea).Redford, Donald B. Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times. (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 20. Also, it is considered unlikely that something as complicated as recessed panel architecture could have worked its way into Egypt by proxy, and at least a small contingent of migrants is often suspected. These early contacts probably acted as a sort of catalyst for the development of Egyptian culture, particularly in respect to the inception of writing, and the codification of royal and vernacular imagery.

While there is clear evidence the Naqada II culture borrowed abundantly from Mesopotamia, the most commonly held view today is that the achievements of the First Dynasty were the result of a long period of indigenous cultural and political development.Early Dynastic Egypt (Routledge, 1999), p.15 Such developments are much older than the Naqada II period,Redford, Donald B., Egypt, Israel, and Canaan in Ancient Times (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 13. the Naqada II period had a large degree of continuity with the Naqada I period,Gardiner, Alan. Egypt of the Pharaohs (Oxford: University Press, 1961), p. 392. and the changes which did happen during the Naqada periods happened over significant amounts of time.Shaw, Ian. and Nicholson, Paul, The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt (London: British Museum Press, 1995), p. 228. Although there are many examples of Mesopotamian influence in Egypt in the 4th millennium BCE, the reverse is not true, and there are no traces of Egyptian influence in Mesopotamia at that time.\\"Because the reverse is not true, namely there is no trace of an Egyptian presence in Mesopotamia at that time, all seems to point to a flow of ideas from Mesopotamia to Egypt.\\" Only very few Egyptian Naqada period object have been found beyond Egypt, and generally in its vicinity, such as a rare Naqada III Egyptian Cosmetic palette in the shape of a fish, of the end of 4th millennium BCE, found in Ashkelon or Gaza.Louvre Museum AO 5359 ==Development of writing (3500–3200 BCE)== Standard reconstruction of the development of writing, with position of cuneiform. There is a possibility that the Egyptian script was invented independently from the Mesopotamian script. It is generally thought that Egyptian hieroglyphs \\"came into existence a little after Sumerian script, and, probably [were], invented under the influence of the latter\\", and that it is \\"probable that the general idea of expressing words of a language in writing was brought to Egypt from Sumerian Mesopotamia\\".Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards, et al., The Cambridge Ancient History (3d ed. 1970) pp. 43–44. The two writing systems are in fact quite similar in their initial stages, relying heavily on pictographic forms and then evolving a parallel system for the expression of phonetic sounds. Standard reconstructions of the development of writing generally place the development of the Sumerian proto-cuneiform script before the development of Egyptian hieroglyphs, with the suggestion the former influenced the latter. There is however a lack of direct evidence, and \\"no definitive determination has been made as to the origin of hieroglyphics in ancient Egypt\\". Instead, it is pointed out and held that \\"the evidence for such direct influence remains flimsy” and that “a very credible argument can also be made for the independent development of writing in Egypt...\\"Simson Najovits, Egypt, Trunk of the Tree: A Modern Survey of an Ancient Land, Algora Publishing, 2004, pp. 55–56. Since the 1990s, the discovery of glyphs on clay tags at Abydos, dated to between 3400 and 3200 BCE, may challenge the classical notion according to which the Mesopotamian symbol system predates the Egyptian one, although Egyptian writing does make a sudden apparition at that time, while on the contrary Mesopotamia has an evolutionary history of sign usage in tokens dating back to circa 8000 BCE.\\"The seal impressions, from various tombs, date even further back, to 3400 B.C. These dates challenge the commonly held belief that early logographs, pictographic symbols representing a specific place, object, or quantity, first evolved into more complex phonetic symbols in Mesopotamia.\\" Also, the Abydos clay tags are virtually identical with contemporary clay tags from Uruk, Mesopotamia.

The affinity is strongest (in red) with ancient populations of the Near East. A recent 2017 study of the mitochondrial DNA composition of Egyptian mummies has shown a high level of affinity with the DNA of the populations of the Near East. The study was made on a mummies of Abusir el-Meleq, near El Fayum, which was inhabited from at least 3250 BCE until about 700 CE. A shared drift and mixture analysis of the DNA of these ancient Egyptian mummies shows that the connection is strongest with ancient populations from the Levant, the Near East and Anatolia, and to a lesser extent modern populations from the Near East and the Levant. In particular the study finds \\"that ancient Egyptians are most closely related to Neolithic and Bronze Age samples in the Levant, as well as to Neolithic Anatolian and European populations\\".50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License: Overall the mummies studied were closer genetically to Near Eastern people than the modern Egyptian population, which has a greater proportion of genes coming from sub-Saharan Africa after the Roman period. The data suggest a high level of genetic interaction with the Near East since ancient times, probably going back to Prehistoric Egypt: \\"Our data seem to indicate close admixture and affinity at a much earlier date, which is unsurprising given the long and complex connections between Egypt and the Middle East. These connections date back to Prehistory and occurred at a variety of scales, including overland and maritime commerce, diplomacy, immigration, invasion and deportation\\"50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License: \\"Our data seem to indicate close admixture and affinity at a much earlier date, which is unsurprising given the long and complex connections between Egypt and the Middle East. These connections date back to Prehistory and occurred at a variety of scales, including overland and maritime commerce, diplomacy, immigration, invasion and deportation\\" in ==Egyptian influence on Mesopotamian art== After this early period of exchange, and the direct introduction of Mesopotamia components in Egyptian culture, Egypt soon started to assert its own style from the Early Dynastic Period (3150–2686 BCE), the Narmer palette being seen as a turning point. The cylinder seals were soon abandoned in favour of scarab seals. Egypt seems to have provided some artistic feedback to Mesopotamia at the time of the Early Dynastic Period of Mesopotamia (2900–2334 BCE). This is especially the case with royal iconography: the figure of the king smiting his enemies with a mace, and the depiction of dead enemies being eaten by birds of prey appeared in Egypt from the time of the Narmer palette, and were then adopted centuries later by Mesopotamian rulers Eannatum and Sargon of Akkad. This depiction appear to be part of an artistic system to promote \\"hegemonistic kingship\\". Another example is the usage of decorated mace heads as a symbol of kingship. There is also a possibility that the depictions of the Mesopotamian king with a muscular, naked, upper body fighting his enemies in a quadrangular posture, as seen in the Stele of Naram-Sin or statues of Gudea (all circa 2000 BCE) were derived from Egyptian sculpture, which by that time had already been through its Golden Age during the Old Kingdom. ==Later periods== ===Trade of Indus goods through Mesopotamia=== ====Etched carnelian beads==== Rare etched carnelian bead have been found in Egypt, which thought to have been imported from the Indus Valley Civilization through Mesopotamia. This is related the flourishing of the Indus Valley Civilization, and the development of Indus-Mesopotamia relations from 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE. Examples of etched carnelian beads found in Egypt typically date to the Late Middle Kingdom (c.1800 BCE). They were found in tombs and represented luxury items, often as the centerpiece of jewelry. ===Hyksos period=== Egypt records various exchanges with West Asian foreigners from around 1900 BCE, as in the paintings of the tomb of Khnumhotep II at Beni Hassan. From circa 1650 BCE, the Hyksos, foreigners of probable Levantine origin, established the Fifteenth Dynasty of Egypt (1650–1550 BCE) based at the city of Avaris in the Nile delta, from where they ruled the northern part of the country. Khyan, one of the Hyksos rulers, is known for his wide-ranging contacts, as objects in his name have been found at Knossos and Hattusha indicating diplomatic contacts with Crete and the Hittites, and a sphinx with his name was bought on the art market at Baghdad and might demonstrate diplomatic contacts with Babylon, possibly with the first Kassites ruler Gandash. Exchanges would again flourish between the two cultures from the period of the New Kingdom of Egypt (c.1550 BC–c.1069 BC), this time an exchange between two mature and well-established civilizations. ===Neo- Assyrian period=== Egypto-Assyrian cylinder seal, combining the Assyrian cuneiform script with Egyptian deities. In the last phase of historic exchanges, the Neo-Assyrians led the Assyrian conquest of Egypt from 677 to 663 BCE. Various artifacts depicting Egyptian pharaohs, deities or persons have been found in Nimrud, and dated to the Neo-Assyrian period, 9th-7th centuries BCE.

He attended Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia starting in 1824.http://www.jefferson.org Mutter graduated with an MD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1831 and eventually took a position as an assistant to Dr. Thomas Harris at the Medical Institute of Jefferson College. At the age of 30, he became the Chair of Surgery at the Jefferson Medical College and held this position from 1841-1856. He operated on hundreds of patients to repair deformities and became the first surgeon in 1846 to administer ether anesthesia in Philadelphia. He is best known for the “Mutter Flap” which he used in order to treat burn victims; the grafting procedure is still used today. During his life, Mütter collected artifacts relating to surgery, which he used when teaching. These ranged from illustrations and wax models to actual specimens of human anatomy. The collection formed the basis for The Mutter Museum, which opened in 1863 in Philadelphia. The museum has a collection of more than 25,000 specimens assembled by Mutter . Today, it includes a vertebra of John Wilkes Booth, a piece of Albert Einstein’s brain, a cancerous growth from the mouth of President Grover Cleveland and the livers and plaster cast of the Siamese twins Chang and Eng. == References == Category:American surgeons Category:1811 births Category:1859 deaths ","title":"Thomas Dent Mutter"},{"id":"60383998","text":"Nora McInerny is an American author.

Warren Rogers, however, is a widower with two daughters and has not taken the opportunity to remarry until now. However, Marion Buckley is very hesitant in accepting the marriage proposal, due to the fact that she had an affair with her employer, Leon Kessler and had promised to marry her. But after confronting Kessler with the news of the marriage proposal, he relents and promises to say nothing of the affair. Buckley and Rogers go on to get married, living happily together, until one day Kessler comes to visit, not to expose Buckley about the affair, but rather to ask for Rogers for his daughter, Ardath's, hand in marriage. Unsuspecting of anything, Rogers agrees to the marriage proposal, but in an effort to save Ardath from Kessler, hinting at an abusive relationship previously, Marion intervenes and tells Roger about the affair between the two. This enrages Rogers causing him to throw out Buckley stating that \\"sowing one's wild oats\\" is all right for a man, but not for a woman\\" . After this conflict, Marion decides to become a newspaper reporter in New York City where she encounters Kessler and learns that he is still chasing after Ardath, who is visiting New York with Rogers. In an attempt to save her from Kessler once again, Marion offers herself to him in exchange for him to leave Ardath alone for good. This conversation is heard through the door by Warren, and leads to him not only violently attack Kessler, but also take Marion back home, seemingly forgiving her. ==Cast== * Francelia Billington as Marion Buckley * Charles Clary as Warren Rogers * Harry von Meter as Leon Kessler * Lillian Rich as Ardath * Nancy Caswell as Betty * Marcel Drageauson as Modiste Assistant * Miss DuPont * Alice Terry ==References== ==Bibliography== * Leonhard Gmür.

The B12 originally succeeded the B11 4.0 in 1988 which was based on the BMW 7 Series (E32) and was also based on the same car. Subsequent models were based on the BMW 7 Series (E38) and the BMW 8 Series (E31). Production ended in 2001 when the 7 Series (E38) models were discontinued. The B12 was replaced by the B7 (E65) and the B6 (E63). == B12 5.0 (E32) == The B12 5.0 was introduced in 1988 and was the first Alpina production automobile to use a V12 engine as its predecessor, the B11 used 3.5 and 4.0 L V8 engines. The suffix 5.0 means the engine displacement which was unchanged from the standard BMW M70 V12. The B12 5.0 was based on the newly introduced 750i/iL. Exterior changes include a front chin spoiler, 17-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels, choice of special colours, \\"B12 5.0\\" badge at the rear and Alpina pinstriping. The interior was customised according to customer specifications which ranged from a wide range of upholstery, steering wheel options and gear knobs and child seats. Standard interior features included an Alpina instrument cluster with a special speedometer and badging.

It was introduced a few months after the introduction of the 850i. Notable mechanical changes include higher compression Mahle pistons fitted to the engine, along with larger intake valves, modified cylinder heads, a new exhaust system and a modified Bosch Motronic ECU. These modifications allowed the engine to have a power output of at 3,500 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm. The engine's red-line was increased to 6,400 rpm. The B12 5.0 was only available with a 4-speed ZF 4HP24E automatic transmission. The transmission was modified electronically for improved gear changes. Other mechanical modifications consisted of new springs and Bilstein shock absorbers. Exterior wise, the car was fitted with the Alpina 17-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels and a front spoiler with special paint choices along with optional Alpina pinstriping.

Originally from Corpus Christi, Texas, Valent joined the United States Life-Saving Service in 1912 and spent the bulk of his service at the Coast Guard station in Brazos, Texas. During the hurricane which made landfall outside Corpus Christi in September 1919, Valent was part of a Coast Guard crew credited with the rescue of the endangered schooner Cape Horn. According to the official account of events, watchstanders at Coast Guard Station 222 spotted the Cape Horn in distress, whereupon the station's 36 foot Type E oar- powered surfboat was launched – Valent among its crew – into the hurricane force swells. The surfboat reached the vessel two hours later, just as the Cape Horn began to sink, and safely rescued all aboard. For his efforts, Valent was decorated with the Silver Lifesaving Medal and also received the Grand Cross from the American Cross of Honor. In 1935 Valent took command of the Coast Guard station in Port Isabel, Texas. He retired in 1940 and went into business with his brother. In 1944 he was appointed to the Brownsville, Texas housing authority board. Valent Hall, a facility at Coast Guard Sector Corpus Christi, is named after Valent.

It comprises two sites, one located in the Marais and the other in Montmartre.Cité internationale des arts on transartists.org == History and description == The Cité internationale des arts, rue de l'Hôtel-de-Ville, in 1981. The Cité internationale des arts was a Franco-Scandinavian idea proposed by the Finnish artist Eero Snellman (1890-1951) during a speech at the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne. It was only after the Second World War that this idea was taken up by Mr. and Mrs. Félix Brunau and became a real project. It took the form of an association created in 1947 which benefited from the support of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as the Academy of Fine Arts and the City of Paris. It had its first headquarters at the Ministry of Culture on rue de Valois before moving to 18 rue de l'Hôtel de Ville in the 4th arrondissement, the City of Paris having granted an emphyteutic lease for the construction of a set of live-work spaces.Cité internationale des arts on Le Parisien Opened 1956, Inaugurated in 1965, the Cité internationale des arts offers residency workshops known as \\"living workshops\\" () designed for work and housing, located at two main sites.

Garrido served as a parish priest and teacher before becoming the canon for the Valencia Cathedral where he often spent long hours listening to confessions. He was also a sought after spiritual director with priests and married couples going to see him for consultation. Garrido founded his order in 1934 with the aim of Christian sanctification for all people with a particular emphasis on the role of women in the Church. The beatification process for Garrido opened in Valencia in 1989 (he was named as a Servant of God) and reached a decisive point on 14 June 2016 after Pope Francis acknowledged his heroic virtue and named him as Venerable. ==Life== Vicente Garrido Pastor was born on 12 November 1896 in Benaguasil in the Valencia province in Spain as the last of seven children to Isidro Garrido and Desamparados (or Amparo) Pastor; he was baptized as \\"Isidro Vicente\\". In 1910 he commenced his ecclesial studies and later received his ordination to the priesthood on 12 June 1921 in the metropolitan cathedral from Enrique Reig Casanova. He served as a vicar first in Benimassot and later served for a few months as the coadjutor vicar for Albaida all spanning between 1922 and 1936 when the Spanish Civil War broke out. Garrido obtained a doctorate for his theological studies from the Universidad Pontificia de Valencia in 1922 and afterwards began teaching seminarians as a professor for both religious and philosophical studies. He was also an active promoter of women in the life of the Church and sought to help expand their role in the Church's mission. Garrido became a canon in 1956 for the metropolitan cathedral where he served long hours in the confessional to hear penitents. The Archbishop of Valencia (and Venerable) José María García Lahiguera expressed his admiration and respect for the priest and noted that Garrido was a good listener and was also an encouraging spiritual director who valued the spiritual growth of his people. Garrido had also been organizing the Spiritual Exercises following the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War. Garrido once helped prepare some girls for their First Communion and asked if some of them were willing to dedicate themselves to God in their lives. Garrido was surprised when one girl - Blessed María Francisca Ricart Olmos - raised her hand and replied that she would do so (she became a Servite nun killed during the Spanish Civil War). Garrido founded the Secular Institute of the Workers of the Cross on 13 June 1934; it received diocesan approval on 21 October 1964 from Archbishop Marcelino Olaechea and then the papal decree of praise from Pope Paul VI on 12 June 1971. He suffered from a painful illness a month before his death on 16 April 1975 and Archbishop Lahiguera celebrated his funeral with 100 priests in attendance. His remains are now housed in the Capilla de la Santa Cruz in Moncada in Valencia. ==Beatification process== The beatification process was launched on 28 February 1989 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled Garrido as a Servant of God after having issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) edict for the cause to begin. The Archbishop of Valencia Miguel Roca Cabanellas inaugurated the diocesan process on 12 June 1990 which Cardinal Agustín García-Gasco Vicente closed on 14 September 1999. The C.C.S. declared the process valid in a decree issued on 20 October 2000 and received the Positio dossier for additional assessment. Garrido became titled as Venerable on 14 June 2016 after Pope Francis confirmed that the late priest had lived a life of heroic virtue. Garrido's beatification now depends upon the papal confirmation of a miracle attributed to him; this is in most cases a healing without a scientific or medical explanation. One such case was investigated in Valencia from 2012 to 2013 and was sent to the C.C.S. around October 2013 who validated that diocesan investigation on 9 May 2014. The current postulator (official in charge of the cause) is Dr. Silvia Mónica Correale. ==References== ==External links== * Hagiography Circle * Obreras de la Cruz I.S.

It is the third entry in the Honkai series and spiritual successor to Guns GirlZ, using many characters from the previous title in a separate story. The game is notable for incorporating a variety of genres, from hack and slash and social simulation, to elements of bullet hell, platforming, shoot 'em up and dungeon crawling across multiple single and multiplayer modes. It features gacha game mechanics. In addition to the mobile game, the storyline of Honkai Impact 3rd spans multiple supplementary media including an anime series, multiple manhua series, and promotional videos. ==Gameplay== Honkai Impact 3rd has players control a team of up to three characters, known as \\"Valkyries\\", in real-time combat against various enemies. During battle, players may freely move their character around the battlefield and switch between their three deployed Valkyries to adapt to various enemy types. Each Valkyrie has unique attack, evasion, switch, and ultimate skills, as well as a rock-paper- scissors-based character type to fulfill different team roles. Valkyrie stats and skills can be customized with various weapons and equipment, which can be improved by using in-game resources. New equipment (known as \\"Stigmata\\"), weapons, and Valkyries can obtained either through in-game crafting or through a gacha system. Single-player game modes include the \\"Story\\" campaign, consisting of short stages punctuated by dialogue in cutscenes and full motion videos (FMVs), \\"Chronicles\\", a series of brief side stories that explore Valkyries' backstories, and \\"Open World\\", allowing exploration of a large open-ended field to gather materials and complete various challenge tasks, coupled with its own storyline. The game features various multiplayer cooperative and competitive modes such as \\"Co-Op Raid\\", where players team up to unlock legendary weapons; \\"Memorial Arena\\", where players compete against a set of bosses for the highest score; and \\"Dirac Sea\\", where players attempt to progress as far as possible through a gauntlet of battles to compete for high scores. Players are able to join groups of other players, called \\"Armadas\\", which allow for more opportunities for events and rewards. Armadas allow for limited requesting of materials and resources from other players in the Armada. Outside of battles, Honkai Impact 3rd allows players to interact with the Valkyrie and Stigmata characters through the \\"Dorm\\" mode. Upon completing character specific tasks, different characters may be able to move into the dorms, whereupon new character information and dialogues between those characters can be seen. Players can craft various pieces of furniture and design the layout of the dorm rooms to increase the \\"comfort\\" of the Valkyries and Stigmata therein. Greater comfort levels allow players to level up their dorm limits for more elaborate decoration. Players are able to visit and view each other's decorated dorm layouts. Secondary gameplay mechanics include various minigames incorporating bullet hell, platforming, and shoot 'em up elements that allow players to gather various crafting and experience materials. Limited-time seasonal events may also include gameplay styles such as dungeon crawling and battle royale which are not normally seen in the main gameplay modes. === Weapons === Each Valkyrie can equip one type of weapon. The weapon types in the game include artillery, gun, sword, scythe, Samurai sword, cross, etc. Players can obtain weapons through shop purchases, collection of weapon fragments, the gacha, part of daily activity, and other ways. After players obtain weapons, they can upgrade and upgrade the weapons to improve their attribute effect. === Stigmata === Each Valkyrie can wear three Stigmata. Players can increase their characters' attack, health, defense, critical chance, and other attribute effects while those characters wear various Stigmata. The Stigmata system can be divided into three types: upper, middle and lower, which correspond to the attributes of attack, defense, and auxiliary. Players can also activate a hidden suit effect when wearing two or three Stigmata of the same suit. Players can obtain Stigmata through the gacha and game stage completions. After players obtain Stigmata, they can strengthen, upgrade, cultivate and other operations to improve the Stigmata === Item Enhancement === Players can enhance Valkyrie stats by \\"enhancing\\" (leveling-up) weapons and Stigmata. Stigmata level up requires a different exp item type than weapons. Upon \\"enhancement\\", the equipment can get a better attribute effect bonus. === Item Upgrading === Players can improve the attribute effect of equipment by upgrading weapons and Stigmata. All weapons or Stigmata can upgrade the star level through \\"upgrade\\"-ing. After upgrading, maximum level limit increases, allowing better effects from the weapon. More advanced weapons and Stigmata require more advanced upgrade materials. Players can obtain upgrade materials by challenging all kinds of scenario copies, extracting from supplies, purchasing in stores, etc. === Currency === The main currency is crystals, which has various non-premium obtaining methods. ==Story== === Setting === Honkai Impact 3rd is set in an alternate version of Earth, plagued by catastrophes resulting from \\"Honkai\\" (in Chinese translates as \\"Chaos\\", while in Japanese, it is said \\"Houkai\\".). Honkai is largely viewed as a malevolent force with a will of its own, able to corrupt humans into undead creatures, manifest itself in the form of various monsters, and select various individuals known as \\"Herrschers\\" to imbue with god-like powers able to trigger apocalyptic events. The Honkai is a cyclic phenomenon, returning to end civilization on Earth each time it gets too advanced - the Previous Era ended 50,000 years prior to the game's start, after the 14th Herrscher defeated humanity. In the present day, various global factions exist to combat or take advantage of the power of Honkai. These include \\"Schicksal\\", a European-based peace keeping organization that deploys human warriors known as Valkyries to combat the Honkai; \\"Anti-Entropy\\", formerly the North American branch of Schicksal that objected to the use of human soldiers in favor of mechanized robots; and \\"World Serpent\\", a shadow organization manipulating events since the end of the Previous Era. Prior to the story's start, three Herrscher awakenings (or \\"Impacts\\") have occurred in the Current Era: the Herrscher of Reason who became the leader of Anti-Entropy instead of fighting humanity, the Herrscher of the Void who was sealed away by Schicksal under mysterious circumstances, and the Herrscher of Lightning who was prevented from fully awakening and sent to train her powers as a Valkyrie at Schicksal's St.Freya school. === Plot === The storyline of Honkai Impact 3rd spans multiple supplementary media including an anime series, multiple manhua series, and promotional videos. The game's story starts with three Valkyries-in-training (Kiana Kaslana, Mei Raiden, and Bronya Zaychik) boarding the Selene, a hostile flying battleship. The three take control of the battleship, then subdue Bronya when she is abruptly controlled malevolently. Following the successful mission, the girls take a graduation exam, during which a mysterious voice contacts Kiana and informs her of her lost parents, Siegfried Kaslana and Cecilia Schariac. The Valkyries then dispatch to Schicksal's Oceania Branch to recover the Gem of Desire following a local Honkai Eruption that decimated the area. The trio discovers Wendy, who was implanted with the Gem of Desire, and learn that Wendy triggered the Honkai Eruption due to a hatred of Schicksal, which had crippled Wendy. Bronya is controlled again and attacks, causing Wendy to transform into a Herrscher. Although Mei and Kiana are able to subdue both girls, Anti-Entropy forces appear and Bronya kidnaps Wendy and Mei. The Valkyries subsequently track Anti-Entropy to the hijacked ME Corp with Bronya's assistance. There, Bronya destroys the biochip in her brain to free herself from Cocolia's control and enable the Valkyries to escape, but leaving Wendy behind. Searching for a way to revive Bronya, Theresa Apocalypse creates a virtual datascape to find data on the biochip. Kiana is transported to a recreation of Siberia during the year 2000 in the midst of the 2nd Honkai War. Kiana meets virtual recreations of her parents, Siegfried and Cecilia, and while Siegfried is badly injured, Kiana and Cecilia team up and successfully defeat a recreation of 2nd Herrscher, Sirin. Upon Sirin's defeat, it is revealed that the events that Kiana experienced were a hallucination created from Kiana's desires by Sirin. Fu Hua captures Kiana and takes her to Schicksal HQ. Theresa, Mei, and Himeko ally with Anti-Entropy forces and storm Schicksal HQ to save Kiana, breaching its defenses with the Selene and the Hyperion. While the Valkyries are successful in infiltrating Schicksal HQ, Rita Rossweisse and Fu Hua captures Himeko and Tesla. Otto Apocalypse successfully reawakens Sirin using Kiana's body as a host. Sirin dispatches Mei, Theresa, and the Anti-Entropy forces and engages Fu Hua in combat, stealing the 3rd Herrscher's power in the process. Himeko and Tesla, with Fu Hua's help, obtain a vial of anti-Honkai serum and a prototype battlesuit imbued with the Herrscher of Flames' power. Himeko dons the battlesuit and engages Sirin, fighting her to a standstill. Einstein uses the Selene's cannon on Sirin, forcing her to retreat into \\"Imaginary Space\\" with Himeko being pulled in as well. Himeko duels with Sirin in the Imaginary Space and injects the anti-Honkai serum into Sirin, causing her to revert to Kiana. Suffering massive losses, the remaining Valkyries and Anti-Entropy mechs retreat, and the world is left devastated in the wake of Sirin's attack. Himeko and Kiana both go missing. Four months after Sirin's attack, Mei, Theresa, and Bronya attempt to meet with an intel dealer named Gray Serpent in Arc City who claims to have seen the Herrscher of the Void, unaware that Otto Apocalypse had dispatched Rita to obtain his information as well. Rita seems to kill Gray Serpent and steals his cybernetic implants, leading the Valkyries to capture a cyborg girl called the Ningyo. Before they can extract the Ningyo's information, Rita intercepts the Valkyries, steals the data, and formats the Ningyo's memory. While Einstein and Tesla attempt to retrieve the Ningyo's lost memories, the team is contacted by Cocolia, who convinces them to help find the Gem of Desire. Gray Serpent, seeking payment for the Valkyrie's theft of the Ningyo, hacks into the Selene. When Bronya follows Gray Serpent into virtual space, he traps Bronya in a data labyrinth formed from her memories to deter her. Bronya is able to escape, though she witnesses a record of the 1st Herrscher, Welt Young, and Einstein battling the World Serpent, who is sealed within the Sea of Quanta. Bronya, Theresa, and Einstein travel to The Deep, where Bronya is reunited with Cocolia and childhood friends Rosalia and Liliya. Cocolia informs the trio that the Gem of Desire was lost in the Sea of Quanta, and must be retrieved. While Einstein prepares to enter the Eye of the Deep, a portal leading to the Sea of Quanta, Bronya attempts to reconcile with Cocolia. When Einstein discovers Cocolia scheming with Gray Serpent, Gray Serpent attacks Einstein and she vanishes. A swarm of Honkai emerges from the Eye of the Deep and attacks, leading Bronya to dive into the Sea of Quanta alone. In the Sea, Bronya is greeted by Joachim, a fragment of Welt Young. Joachim sends Bronya to multiple pocket universes as a test, during which Bronya is reunited with Seele Vollerei (Bronya's childhood friend who became stuck in quantum state following a failed X-10 Project years ago). In efforts to guide Seele out of the quanta, they resolve to escape together. After clearing some honkai beasts and being separated, Seele and Bronya reunite and try to escape the labyrinth. The two girls reach the edge of the Quanta but are caught by tentacles. Bronya makes a sacrifice and cuts the tentacles binding Seele, succumbing to the tentacles herself. However, Seele dislikes her powerlessness and the Dark Seele (Veliona) finally agrees to lend her power to Seele, and they use their combined power to rescue Bronya. Back to Kiana; after recapturing control of her body, she has been living in exile alone in the Arc City in order not to hurt others with the Herrscher personality. One night, she is fighting with Honkai beasts when Sirin seeks the opportunity to torment and brainwash Kiana, attempting to reawake the Herrscher. Fortunately, Fu Hua reaches Kiana's mind and drive Sirin away. Kiana holds hatred towards Fu Hua at first, but Fu Hua tells Kiana that their spirits are combined forever due to the power of Key of Deity, and that Kiana must learn to control the Herrscher power by herself. Under Fu Hua's training, Kiana finally succeeds, and returns to fighting against Honkai in Arc City. ==Development== The production team for Honkai Impact 3rd grew from a 7-person start to employing over 200 employees in 2018. miHoYo offers small amounts of in-game currency to users that fill out surveys about their experience in the game, allowing the game's developers to adjust future events and tweak the game. As a result, Honkai Impact 3rd is under a continuous- update system, patching bug fixes and changing or adding content multiple times per year. The game has had many significant changes since launch, including rewriting the entire first two chapters of the story in a December 2018 update. The developers stated that their decision to make Honkai Impact 3rd be in the free-to-play monetization system (rather than a premium, or paid, game) with the purpose of making the game more available to players. Devil May Cry and Bayonetta significantly affected the game makers' ideas for the fight system of Honkai Impact 3rd. After a few years of users emulating Honkai Impact 3rd on computers and an update making emulation more difficult, the game's official PC version was developed, releasing to the public on December 26, 2019. ===Manhua=== Honkai Impact 3rd features an ongoing serialized manhua of the same name in Chinese and in English. The manhua begins before Chapter 1 of the main game story arc that aims to supplement and flesh out the in-game plot, and often includes character origins. Several in- game battlesuits worn by the Valkyries are illustrated in the manhua as well. The manhua has three prequel titles and one main title. ==Reception== A Honkai Impact 3rd-themed alt= The game first attracted a large fanbase in Asia before spreading globally: first released in China in late 2016, it reached 1 million downloads in Japan 11 days after release, and IGN reported that Honkai Impact 3rd gathered a total of 35 million downloads worldwide as of March 28, 2018. The game has been released in Korea, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, North America, and Europe, and supports multiple languages including Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, French, German, and Indonesian. Besides when it released and when the official PC version was created, little media focus has been on Honkai Impact 3rd. The continual updates and overhauls to Honkai Impact 3rd's events and mechanics make many of the reviews written (when the game released) inaccurate representations of the gameplay and quality of the game presently. Reviews say that the game has changed through ups and downs as it tweaked its system and tested in-game events to be ultimately more engaging and enjoyable. Similarly, many article guides exist for gameplay elements that no longer exist within the game, such as the base. The majority of recent articles (as of March 2020) concerning or mentioning Honkai Impact 3rd either announce its PC release, or mention it while featuring Genshin Impact, miHoYo's recent release. In an article from 2017, Ungeek.com says that the game has some later-game systems that are unintuitive, and cites the large download size for a mobile game as a negative. The review praised the game's visual quality and the ease of learning to play the game, as well as the overall quality of the game, and positively recommended it. The article mentioned that the quality of the game was comparable to console games. == References == ==External links== * Official Asian website * Official global website * Official Taiwan website * Official Korean website * Official Chinese website * Official Japanese website Category:2016 video games Category:Action role-playing video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Gacha games Category:IOS games Category:Mobile games Category:Video games containing battle passes Category:Video games developed in China Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Free-to-play video games Category:Windows games ","title":"Honkai Impact 3rd"},{"id":"60384519","text":"Simon Hooper (born 15 July 1982) is an English professional football referee who officiates in the Premier League having been promoted to the Select Group of Referees in 2018.

Born in West Bromwich, Brockhouse's father was the owner of J. Brockhouse & Company, which made axles. Harry became a pupil teacher at the West Bromwich Board School, then qualified as a schoolteacher. However, by 1911, he was the company secretary for his father's firm. He later took up an important position at Vickers. In his youth, Brockhouse was a supporter of the Liberal Party, and was a prominent local nonconformist. He became interested in Georgism, and founded a local Democratic Club to promote the principle, then when he was twenty-seven, he heard a talk by Caroline Martyn which convinced him to become a socialist. He joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and served for many years as president of its West Bromwich branch. He proposed the formation of district councils and federations within the party. This was approved, and by 1906, Brockhouse was president of the party's South Staffordshire Federation. That year, he was elected to the ILP's National Administrative Committee, serving for three years as the representative of its Midlands Division. From 1903, he also served as chair of the party's Divisional Council. Brockhouse's married Amy Brocklehurst, who was active in the Women's Social and Political Union. When the United Kingdom census, 1911 was conducted, she made herself absent from the house, along with their eldest daughter, Doreen, in accordance with the WSPU policy to boycott the census. Harry himself was active in the Men's League for Women's Suffrage. For many years, Brockhouse was a strong supporter of the Clarion movement. Along with the majority of the ILP, he opposed World War I, and therefore cut his ties with the Clarion. Brockhouse also served on West Bromwich Town Council for many years, founded the West Bromwich Labour Church, and was president of the national Labour Church Union in 1907. ==References== Category:1868 births Category:1921 deaths Category:Councillors in the West Midlands (county) Category:Georgists Category:Independent Labour Party councillors Category:Independent Labour Party National Administrative Committee members Category:People from West Bromwich ","title":"Harry Brockhouse"},{"id":"60384536","text":"Ust-Tyrym () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Gornozavodsky District, Perm Krai, Russia.

The film stars Sunny Deol, Karan Kapadia, Karanvir Sharma and Ishita Dutta. It was jointly produced by Shrikant Bhasi, Nishant Pitti, & Pictures, Tony D'Souza, and Vishal Rana. The film follows a terrorist who plans to bomb Mumbai along with his compatriots. After meeting with an accident, he loses memory of his mission, but an investigating officer refuses to take his word for it, and plans to kill him in an encounter. Blank was Khambata's directorial debut, and was also Kapadia's first film debut. The principal photography for the film began in September 2018. The soundtrack was composed by Raghav Sachar, Arko Pravo Mukherjee, and Sonal Pradhaan, with lyrics written by Arko Pravo Mukherjee, Adeip Singh, Kumaar and Sonal Pradhaan, and released under the banner Zee Music Company. The film was theatrically released in India on 3 May 2019. Blank received generally negative reviews from critics, and has grossed over 5.15 crore in worldwide. == Plot == Hanif, a member of the terrorist organisation Tehreer Al-Hind, arrives in Mumbai with his team to execute 24 bomb blasts, each by a terrorist. On the day of the attack, he is injured in a road accident and taken to the hospital. Upon realizing that a time bomb is attached to his body, the hospital staff notify SS Dewan, a member of the Anti-Terrorism Squad. The doctors find it impossible to remove the bomb from Hanif's body as it is connected directly to his heart. Hanif regains consciousness but has developed retrograde amnesia following the accident. However, Dewan refuses to trust him and believes he is lying. Meanwhile, Husna and Rohit, Dewan's subordinates, arrest another terrorist named Farukh. Aruna Gupta, Dewan's superior, orders him to kill Hanif as the information they need can be obtained from Farukh. Dewan, acommpanied by a squad, takes Hanif to an isolated place to kill him in an encounter. Husna, who has recovered the bomb's blueprint from Hanif's house, realizes that Hanif's death will trigger the explosion of the other 24 bombs. When Hanif is about to be killed, a gang of terrorists attack the officers. The former escape following a car chase and take Hanif to a secret basement. Hanif meets Maqsood, his leader, who tells him that he his parents were murdered in communal riots. Dewan and his squad capture Hanif again and kills all other terrorists including Maqsood. Hanif escapes. It is revealed that Husna was the mole in Dewan's squad who helped Hanif escape. Hanif and Husna are revealed to be siblings whose parents were murdered by Maqsood years ago in a communal riot. Hanif removes his chest bomb and throws into a compartment on a train that housed all the suicide bombers, killing them. Hanif reveals to Dewan via phone that he had no memory loss and behaved so to use Dewan and kill Maqsood, who had killed his parents and turned him into a terrorist. Hanif hangs up and destroys the phone, and Dewan promises to catch Hanif and Husna for their betrayal. The film ends with the song 'Ali Ali' featuring Akshay Kumar in a guest appearance. == Cast == * Sunny Deol as SS Dewan, an Anti-Terrorism Squad officer * Karan Kapadia as Hanif * Karanvir Sharma as Rohit * Ishita Dutta as Husna * Jameel Khan as Maqsood * Unknown as Raunak Dewan * Akshay Kumar in a special appearance in the song \\"Ali Ali\\" * Boloram Das as Farooq *Shaji Choudhary as Terrorist == Production == In September 2018, Behzad Khambata announced his directorial debut via a post on Facebook. The film was to be titled Blank and would star Sunny Deol and Karan Kapadia. Principal photography began shortly after the announcement. Blank is also the film debut of Kapadia, who is the nephew of actress Dimple Kapadia. Akshay Kumar, who is Kapadia's brother-in-law, features in a cameo appearance for a song. While filming a sequence that required Kapadia to be handcuffed, the keys to the cuffs were lost and Kapadia had to remain in the position for two hours. == Soundtrack == The film's soundtrack was composed by Raghav Sachar, Arko Pravo Mukherjee and Sonal Pradhaan, with lyrics written by Arko Pravo Mukherjee, Adeip Singh, Kumaar and Sonal Pradhaan, and released under the banner Zee Music Company. == Marketing and release == In September 2018, a press release stated that Blank would be released in India on 11 January 2019. The release was then indefinitely postponed, and in March 2019, the release was announced to be on 3 May that year. According to the producer Vishal Rana, the release was first postponed as other films with similar themes as Uri: The Surgical Strike were to release around the same time. On 1 April, two teaser posters were released online. The film's trailer was released on 3 April 2019. The Times of India wrote, \\"This jaw-dropping trailer is nothing but one ride that will give an ample of adrenaline rush\\". Similarly, The Indian Express opined, \\"The crisply cut and edited trailer is high on action, thrill and some heavy dose of dialogues\\". Shortly before the film's release, Deol joined the Bharatiya Janata Party. Rana maintained that the film was not being released in that time period for any political motive or to gain any publicity, and stated that it was a coincidence. Five days prior to its release, the film was selectively screened at locations across India for test audiences. Kapadia visited one such screening in Delhi for promoting the film. Blank was theatrically released in India on 3 May 2019. Other than Blank, the only other Hindi release that day was the crime thriller Setters. == Reception == === Critical response === Blank received generally negative reviews from critics. Devesh Sharma of Filmfare states, \\"Given its premise, the film had the potential to be an edge- of-the-seat thriller, if only the writing and execution could have been better\\". He criticised almost all aspects of production, but felt the \\"only redeeming aspect [was] the action\\". Writing for The Hindu, Namrata Joshi opines, \\"Blank eventually doesn't rise above being a stilted \\"bad Muslim\\" narrative. It's yet another film that plays on Islamophobia and it does say a lot that it comes with the backing of the BJP candidate from Gurdaspur... and the Canadian journalist specialising in doing non-political interviews[.]\\" Devansh Sharma of Firstpost gave it two and a quarter stars out of five and felt the film had a \\"promising start\\", \\"[b]ut by the time the close-to-two- hour-long film ends, the urgency gives way to convolution\\". However, he felt Kapadia \\"proves to be an immensely watchable leading man, because of his unconventional intensity and the organic ability to pull off action sequences\\". Writing for Film Companion, Anupama Chopra appreciated the film's element of surprise but bemoaned the lack of a strong script for \\"an inherently intriguing idea\\", stating, \\"[E]ach time the suspense builds, the logic-free plot deflates it\\". She felt Kapadia's performance was restricted to being \\"poker-faced as the character demands but equally ferocious\\", while commenting that Deol's sequences \\"are the best part of the film\\". In a more negative review for Film Companion, Rahul Desai wrote, \\"Soapy craft and writing aside, the problem lies in the film’s facile politics. Given its release in the midst of the country’s Lok Sabha Elections, it’s not surprising to see a star in service of a statement\\". Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave it two and a half stars out of five, but approached the film more positively, writing, \\"Blank is well directed and performed and is based on the relatable events of terrorism. Sunny Deol's fans will love him in an action packed role after a long time\\". Priyanka Sinha Jha of CNN-News18 gave the same rating but wrote, \\"Despite Sunny Deol's presence, the film fails to pack in a punch\\". Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film two stars out of five, writing, \\"All the spiffiness, sadly, stays on the surface, leaving Blank groping for purpose\\", and added, \\"The film is let down by a storyline that strains credulity\\". Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express rated it one and a half stars out of five and felt it \\"emphasizes its over-used thrust - Islamic ‘aatankwaad' threatening the unity and integrity of ‘akhand’ Bharat\\"; Gupta felt Kapadia performed well in the action sequences \\"but will need to work hard on emoting\\", while Deol was at his usual./ Raja Sen of Hindustan Times wrote, \\"All the bad guys in this film have beards. Sunny Deol does not. He is a good guy, and therefore shortchanged in the facial hair department... Yep, this is that kind of film\\". Writing for The Times of India, Rachit Gupta concurred, \\"The movie has flashes of promise but just as many, if not more, moments of amateur execution\\", and felt Khambata's \\"inexperience shows in many portions where the filmmaker's choices aren't top-notch\\". === Box office === Blank had a poor opening on its first day, earning 40-45 lakh nett in India. It earned a total of 2.25 crore nett in its opening weekend, which was also considered poor. On its first Monday, the film earned 40 lakh nett, demonstrating a slight drop from its first day. The following day, it earned 30 lakh nett. On Wednesday, the film earned the same amount, and on Thursday, it earned 25 lakh nett and was out of most theatres.

The term emerged in the United States after hundreds of daily and weekly newspapers were closed in the 2000s and the 2010s. According to a study in 2018 by the UNC School of Media and Journalism, more than 1,300 communities in the U.S. are considered news deserts. Other communities, while not technically a news desert, may be covered by a ghost newspaper, a publication that has become a shadow of its former self. ==Background== The total number of newspapers in the U.S. fell from 8,891 in 2004 to 7,112 in 2018, a decline of 1,779 newspapers, including more than 60 daily newspapers.https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/loss- of-local-news/loss-newspapers-readers/ Of the remaining publications, an estimated 1,000 to 1,500 newspapers were considered ghost newspapers after scaling back their news coverage so much that they were unable to fully cover their communities.https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news- desert/loss-of-local-news/the-rise-of-the-ghost-newspaper/ ==Extent== In 2017, the Columbia Journalism Review released a map of news deserts across the United States. It showed that Collin County and Williamson County in Texas, with a combined population of nearly 1.3 million people, were among the largest news deserts in the country. Other notable news deserts include Ellis County, Texas and Alamance County, North Carolina. Some of those communities, however, may be covered by very small newspapers with a circulation of less than 1% or all-digital news outlets.https://www.cjr.org/local_news/american- news-deserts-donuts-local.php A study in 2018 by the UNC School of Media and Journalism found more than 1,300 news deserts in the United States. Of the 3,143 counties in the U.S., more than 2,000 no longer had a daily newspaper and 171 counties, with 3.2 million residents combined, had no newspaper at all. People who live in news deserts tend to be poorer, older and less educated than the average American, according to the study.

During the postwar years Herman Bleich spent seven years as chairman Foreign Press Association in the Netherlands. For fifty years he was the Netherlands correspondent for mainstream national newspapers in Germany, Switzerland and Israel. Many years later Anet Bleich confided to a student-interviewer that when she was ten she had dreamed of growing up to become a \\"professional revolutionary, like Rosa Luxemburg\\". Subsequently, she attended the Gymnasium Haganum where she was at one stage \\"editor in chief\\" of the school magazine, \\"Spectemur Agendo\\". She studied political science at the older University of Amsterdam. During 1969 and 1970, while still a student, she was a member of the Working Youth Group which had emerged through then university's left-wing student movements of the later 1960s. Another member of the group was her contemporary, Max van Weezel, who has also become a political journalist. The two of them have subsequently then married. Their daughter, born in 1986 has followed her parents into journalism. In 1972, like several of her university contemporaries Anet Bleich joined the Communist Party, remaining a member till approximately 1975. During the 1980s and 1990s, as cold war tensions began to ease a little, her left-wing political convictions were seen to have become more nuanced. Invited in 1997 to compare Nazism and Communism, she accepted the validity of the question, \\"but what I do not appreciate is the painful party-game that asks which is the worse of the two\\". She insists on the need to differentiate between different forms and phases of communism, asserting that communism ceases to be viable if you democratise it. At the end, the only way to reform communism was to abolish it. Bleich spent ten years as an editor with De Groene Amsterdammer, a long-established left-leaning weekly news magazine produced in Amsterdam. She later said that her journalistic identity had been largely formed by that experience. In 1989 she joined de Volkskrant (a daily national newspaper) as a columnist. Much of her work reflects her long-standing involvement in left-wing intellectualism and feminism. Her writing is also informed by her Jewish provenance. She contributes articles to publications produced by the Anne Frank Foundation. She has contributed to the \\"Auschwitz Bulletin\\" of the Netherlands Auschwitz Committee (NAC). Her work reflects a powerful commitment to the Dutch antifascist movement. One example among many is an article she co-wrote with Rudi Boon in the book \\"Nederlands racisme\\" (1984). She also addressed the topic directly in the book \\"Oud en nieuw fascisme\\" from the Anne Frank Foundation. On 21 February 2008 Bleich received a doctorate for her biographical study of the political leader Joop den Uyl: it was published under the title \\"Joop den Uyl 1919-1987. Dromer en doordouwer\\" (loosely \\"... dreamer and thinker\\"). The work was supervised by Piet de Rooy and can be seen as the first biography of van Eyl based on archive material and interviews with individuals involved. It makes extensive use of personal papers not previously released to researchers. It also featured on the front pages of mainstream newspapers in the Netherlands because of disclosures in it concerning the covering-up by van Eyl of Prince Bernhard's involvement in the so-called Northrop affair back in 1976. ==References== Category:People from Amsterdam Category:Dutch columnists Category:20th-century Dutch journalists Category:21st-century Dutch journalists Category:Dutch biographers Category:Living people Category:1951 births ","title":"Anet Bleich"},{"id":"60384944","text":"Cover of the 2016 English translation of LS6.

She is remembered for starting the Portuguese tradition of bringing gifts of clothes, toys and sweets to children in hospital at Christmas. She fought successfully to have conditions for female prisoners significantly improved. In addition to her award-winning poetry, Lutgarda de Caires published articles in the press calling for equal opportunities for women and improvements to their property rights. ==Biography== Born in Vila Real de Santo António in 1873, Lutgarda Guimarães was the daughter of María Teresa de Barros y José Rodrigues Guimarães. After her mother died when she was still a small child, she and her brother were lovingly cared for by her father who introduced them to the harp, violin and sitar. While still young, Guimarães left the Algarve and moved to Lisbon where she met and later married João de Caires, a lawyer from Madeira. He founded the Sociedade de Propaganda de Portugal which met regularly in their home, bringing together guests interested in discussing literature. Guimarães also took part in the meetings but was initially saddened by the death of her infant daughter. It was her daughter's death that encouraged her to take clothes, toys and sweets to the children in the Hospital da Estefânia. From 1905, she began to contribute articles on social issues to newspapers and journals. As for her poetry, her first work was Glicínias (1910). Other popular works were Papoilas (1912) and A Dança do Destino, contos e narrativas (1913). In 1923, her sonnet Florinha da Rua won the first prize in the Hispano-Portuguese Floral Games in Ceuta. In 1911, the Ministry of Justice invited her to undertake a study of the conditions in which prisoners lived, especially women. As a result of her criticisms, improvements followed. In June 1913, she, Ana Augusta de Castilho, Beatriz Pinheiro, Joana de Almeida Nogueira and Maria Veleda were part of the Portuguese delegation at the Seventh Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in Budapest.

Merritt. One of these was architect Adelbert B. Chanel, who wen on to design nine of the houses built in the neighborhood. They platted the area into spacious lots, with boundaries following the local topography. Grading of the area was done in 1923, and by 1927 the first two houses had been constructed in the new subdivision. Two more were added in 1928, but the onset of the Great Depression slowed growth, and it was not until 1931 that the next four homes were built. Eight more were built in the 1930s, but the onset of World War II again halted expansion until 1948, when three more houses were built. One more house was built in the 1950s, and the last two were added in the 1960s. ==Description== The Merritt Woods Historic District contains 23 residences, of which 18 contribute to the historic nature of the neighborhood.

It was released in August 2018 in the United States by Simon & Schuster. The book has been described as a psychological thriller and horror fiction against a science fiction backdrop. Reid referred to it as a \\"philosophical suspense story\\". Foe is set in the near future and is about a married couple living on a remote farm whose lives are thrown in turmoil when a stranger arrives. Foe was placed on the Horror Writers Association's 2018 Bram Stoker Awards Preliminary Ballot for \\"Superior Achievement in a Novel\\". Reid sold the film rights for Foe to entertainment company Anonymous Content four months before the book was published. He has been earmarked as the film's executive producer. ==Plot summary== Foe is set in the near future, and is narrated by Junior, who lives with his wife Henrietta on a remote farm. In the novel, all dialogue is punctuated with quote marks, except for Junior's, which has none. One night a stranger appears at their door who introduces himself as Terrance from an aerospace corporation called OuterMore. Terrance announces that Junior has been selected to travel to the Installation, a large space station in orbit around Earth. He will remain there for about two years, before returning home. Junior is deeply in love with Hen and is not happy leaving her alone. Terrance reassures him that while he is gone, he will be replaced by a biomechanical duplicate that will care for Hen. Junior is horrified. Terrance visits the farm house regularly to interview him and collect data to help configure his replacement. Relations between Junior and Hen become strained. He resents Terrance's presence and she will not talk about it. After about two years, Terrance moves in with them so he can monitor Junior's daily routine. Terrance also spends time interviewing Hen, which angers Junior. He manages to eavesdrop on some of their conversations, and it seems that she knows more about what is going on than she is telling him. Once Terrance asks her if she would like to get away, and she relates to him a fantasy she has of walking out on her husband. After seeing Terrance spend so much time with Hen, Junior becomes convinced that it is Terrance who will be replacing him when he has gone. One day Terrance congratulates Junior, saying that he did very well. Junior is confused, then astounded when another man looking exactly like him walks in through the door. Terrance introduces the stranger as the real Junior who has just returned from the Installation. He explains to a stunned Junior that he is the replacement sent two years ago to live with the real Junior's wife. Junior refuses to believe this and pleads with Hen for help, but she remains quiet. As he becomes filled with rage, Terrance says, \\"It's time for this to end,\\" and shuts him down. The real Junior becomes the narrator, with quote-marked speech, and is pleased to be back home again with his wife. When he asks Hen what it was like living with \\"it\\", she says it was difficult at first. His behaviour was predictable, but he adapted quickly and she was surprised how much he genuinely cared for her. She says she regrets him having being shutdown. This angers Junior, who can't understand how she could have felt anything for her \\"fake digital husband\\". Their relationship deteriorates, until one day she walks out. That night she returns, but has changed – she is affectionate and cares for him. Junior is pleased to have his wife back as he remembered her. In the text, Hen's dialogue now has no quote marks. A few days later, Terrance visits briefly to check on them. Hen is pleased to see him and says that everything is fine. Junior agrees, adding, \\"things are finally getting back to normal\\". ==Background== Reid said in an interview that the theme of isolation in Foe and his first novel, I'm Thinking of Ending Things comes from growing up on a farm in remote Ontario. While he appreciates solitude, he said he recognises the importance of relationships, and the tension between seclusion and companionship fascinates him. Reid said his desire to write about space came from his brother, who works in the space industry. He discussed this topic often with his brother, but when Reid gave him early drafts of Foe to read, his response was, \\"It's not really about space.\\" Reid ended up cutting so much that the outer-space parts became \\"more of a metaphor than anything else\\". ==Reception== In a review in the Los Angeles Review of Books, Gabino Iglesias described Foe as \\"an engrossing, strange, addictive read.\\" He said the blend of \\"literary fiction, science fiction, psychological thriller, and horror\\" produces an unsettling read in which every event is viewed with suspicion. While most of the story takes place in Junior and Henrietta's farmhouse, Reid's exploration of their relationship makes it \\"a universe full of questions and possibilities.\\" Iglesias called Reid \\"one of the most talented purveyors of weird, dark narratives in contemporary fiction.\\" Writing in The Columbus Dispatch, Margaret Quamme called the novel \\"stark\\" and \\"unsettling\\". She said its power is in what the story leaves out, rather than what it presents. Telling it from Junior's restricted point of view gives the reader a limited picture of what is happening. She remarked that Foe is science fiction in the same way that The Twilight Zone is science fiction – it explores human behaviour rather than creates \\"a credible, scientifically based world of the future.\\" Quamme described Foe as \\"[a] subtly disturbing horror novel [that] lets the questions it raises hover, unresolved, in the reader's mind.\\" Zachary Houle found Foe to be \\"genuinely creepy and paranoid\\". Reviewing the book on the online publishing website Medium, Houle said it is science fiction, \\"but not very\\" – Reid provides no details of the biotechnology used in the story. He suggested calling the book \\"new weird\\", a literary genre American author Jeff VanderMeer popularized, and added that Foe could be compared to VanderMeer's novel Borne. He also compared the paranoia in Foe to \\"one of the most paranoid texts\\", John Carpenter's 1982 film The Thing. Houle wrote that while he had reservations about the book's \\"multiple endings\\", the reader is rewarded with a \\"double- twist\\". He concluded that it is \\"a superlative tale\\", and called it \\"one of the very best Canadian books I have read in a long, long, long time.\\" According to the review aggregator Book Marks, the novel received \\"rave\\" reviews, based on 7 reviews. ==References== ==External links== * *Foe at Fantastic Fiction *Foe at Simon & Schuster Category:2010s horror novels Category:2018 Canadian novels Category:2018 science fiction novels Category:Canadian horror novels Category:Canadian science fiction novels Category:Psychological thriller novels Category:Simon & Schuster books ","title":"Foe (Reid novel)"},{"id":"60385076","text":"Katerina Stewart was the defending champion, having won the previous edition 2015, but chose not to participate.

She began her ballet studies (in 1945) with the dancer Eros Volúsia, then a teacher at the Serviço Nacional de Teatro (National Theater Service); she completed her training at the Theatro Municipal School of Dance (now the Maria Olenewa State Dance School) with the Russian-Brazilian teacher Maria Olenewa and Yuco Linderberg in the 1940s. On March 18, 1948, in a difficult selection test, she was approved to join the ballroom of the Municipal Theater, being the first black woman to obtain it and, along with Raul Soares who also attended this contest, one of the two black people there. Despite this, she suffered constant discrimination, to the point of not being able to work; in a 1981 interview she stated: \\"Madeleine Rosay, Vaslav Veltchek, Edy Vasconcelos and Nina Verchinina gave me good career opportunities, without looking at my color. The problems came after that. I got myself excluded of everything and even if I put a doormat covering my face, they would not let me step on the scene. I only once crossed the stage wearing pointed sneakers, and still in the background. \\" - to which she sought to circumvent, as she said on another occasion: \\"Everything was always very difficult, but who would assume or make it clear that part of my difficulties was because I was not white? They would never tell me this, or say that the problem was racial, but I knew it was, and so I always struggled every time to try to perfect myself. \\" She the went to join the Teatro Experimental do Negro as a dancer, then as collaborator and eventually as a choreographer . Sculpture of Mercedes Baptista in Rio de Janeiro, byM. Pitanguy. Invited by choreographer and anthropologist Katherine Dunham, creator of the first all-African-American modern dance company, Baptista went to that country where she took classes in modern dance and took part in the civil rights movement. Back in Brazil, she founded the Ballet Folclórico Mercedes Baptista, dedicated to the formation of black dancers, who researched and incorporated Afro-Brazilian culture into their work and movements, gaining prominence in the artistic scene and touring throughout Europe and Latin America. In 1963 she elaborated the choreography of the samba school Acadêmicos do Salgueiro, and pioneered in its comissão de frente elements of classical dance.\\" == Death == Suffering from diabetes and heart problems, Mercedes died at the age of 93 in the retirement home where she lived in the Copacabana neighborhood, and her body was cremated at the Memorial do Carmo. == Homages == Baptista was honored by Rio samba schools Acadêmicos do Cubango, in 2008, and Unidos de Vila Isabel, in 2009.

(2004). Cancer of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Expert Review of Anticancer Therapy, 4(3), 411–424. https://doi.org/10.1586/14737140.4.3.411 Meanwhile, the major age group of the cancer is between 50–70 years old. It was also found that the number of male patients are twice larger than female patients. During the early phase of the cancer, the symptoms could be nasal obstruction, hyposmia, etc. Other symptoms will also appear as further growth of malignant cells and invasion of into other human tissue such as palate, orbital floor continuing. The head X-rays test and neck MRI could make contribution to the diagnosis of the cancer while normal surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy can be utilized for the treatment of the cancer. ==Signs and symptoms== Paranasal sinuses Sometimes, people with nasal cavity or paranasal sinus cancer do not show any of these symptoms. In fact, these types of cancer are usually diagnosed in their later stages because early-stage cancer typically does not cause any symptoms. Nasal cavity or paranasal sinus cancer is often discovered when a person is being treated for seemingly benign, inflammatory disease of the sinuses, such as sinusitis. The signs and symptoms are generally caused by the neighbour structures like the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity.Siddiqui, F., Smith, R., Yom, S., Beitler, J., Busse, P., Cooper, J., … Salama, J. (2017). ACR appropriateness criteria® nasal cavity and paranasal sinus cancers. Head & Neck, 39(3), 407–418. https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.24639 There are no obvious signs and symptoms before the invasion of the tumor into bony area occurred. During the progress of the cancer, the overall signs and symptoms could be sinus pressure and blocked sinus, sinus areas pain and headaches, Nosebleeds, ear pressure and pain, etc.National Cancer Institute (2019). Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer Treatment (Adult) (PDQ®)–Patient Version. National Cancer Institute. Retrieved 1st April,2019 from https://www.cancer.gov/types/head-and-neck/patient/adult/paranasal-sinus- treatment-pdq#_1 Different symptoms will start to appear as the tumor start to invade into other body structures. symptoms such as proptosis, diplopia and other visual lesions would appear when tumor invade into the orbit. Symptoms such as trismus (lockjaw), facial swelling, toothache, mid-face or jaw numbness would occur as the tumor invades the infratemporal fossa, pterygopalatine fossae or masseteric space. Invasion to the cranial cavity may lead to headaches, nerve damage, and cerebrospinal fluid leak. ==Risk factors== ===Cigarettes and tobacco products=== Cigarettes smoking is strongly related to the risk of getting nasal cancer, smokers would burden excess 20% risk of having nasal cancer.Zheng, W., Mclaughlin, J., Chow, W., Chien, H., Blot, W., & Zheng, W. (1993). Risk factors for cancers of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses among white men in the United States. American Journal of Epidemiology, 138(11), 965–972. https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a116816 There is a positive relationship between the quantity of the smoked cigarettes, time period of smoking and the risk of having the cancer while the risk would decrease if smokers stop smoking. Though it was found that the risk of having cancer have no relationship with amount of consumption of cigarettes by spouses. However, based on the research in Japan, the passive smoking receivers would burden higher risks of having the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. 160x160px Furthermore, the direct contact with tobacco powder such as gum and buccal mucosa would also largely increase the possibility of getting the cancer.Brinton, L., Blot, W., Becker, J., Winn, D., Browder, J., Farmer, J., & Fraumeni, J. (1984). A Case-control Study of Cancers of the Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinuses. American Journal of Epidemiology, 119(6), 896–906. https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a113812 ===Environmental factors=== It was found that the environmental factors can be seen as one of the main causes of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. exposure to textile dust, wood dust, nickel and leather might also cause the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity tumor. Meanwhile, it is also risky to exposure to the radium fumes, formaldehyde fumes and other fumes products used for producing furnitures and shoes. People who exposure to the air pollution is also the high risk group of getting the cancer. === Alcohol === It was supported that the alcohol consumption could increase the risk of the cancer. However, there is no evidence for the specific impacts of alcohol to histologic different types of the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. a large amount of the consumption of salted food and smoked food may also increase the risk of getting paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. Meanwhile, infection of human papillomavirus can be considered as the lead factors of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. The increase of risk of the cancer may also occur due to the chronic nasal conditions. ==Diagnosis== === Physical test === Initially, an overall physical test will be implemented by the doctor. to check patient health situation and find signals of the cancer such as lump.National Cancer Institute (2019). Paranasal Sinus and Nasal Cavity Cancer Treatment (Adult) (PDQ®)–Patient Version. National Cancer Institute. Retrieved 1st April,2019 from https://www.cancer.gov/types/head-and-neck/patient/adult/paranasal-sinus- treatment-pdq#_1 The patient past medical records will also provide essential information to the doctor. Meanwhile, the examination of unusual areas around face will be implemented by doctor small long-handed mirror. However, blood test or urine test cannot make contribution to the diagnosis of the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. === X-rays === X-rays will be utilized to identify the unusual part in the patient sinus such as treatable infection rather than air. The CT scan should be applied for further detection of the signals of cancer. The head and neck X-rays will also involved in the diagnosis of the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. === CT Scan & MRI === As the imaging plays a pivotal role in diagnosing the cancer cells. The CT scan and MRL should be used in the diagnosis process to extend the investigation of the cancer. The coronal CT scan could make more contribution to the identification of the damage level of bone especially in the area of cribriform plate. MRI technology can be seen as a more efficient method to identify the tumor located in the soft issue and fluid. Meanwhile, The MRI technology could make contribution to the determinations of tumor size. === Biopsy === The biopsy is the examination of a small part of the human tissue with the help of microscope. Only the biopsy could determine the final diagnosis of the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. The biopsy examination can be divided into different types of biopsy. The FNA biopsy can be implemented by a needle extract tissue or fluid. The incisional of biopsy aims to extract the likely malignant tissue in the patient body. === Bone scan === The main goal of bone scan is to investigate whether the cancer cells of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity has spread into the bone. === Nasoscopy === The nasoscopy will be utilized as the diagnosis method of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. The nasoscopy can be implemented by the insertion of a nasoscope into the patient nose and search for abnormal area insert the nose. The tissue might be extracted with the help of a special tool and examined by the microscope and search for the signals of the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. === Other diagnosis methods === The PET scan will also be implemented to detect the cancer cells inside the body. The positron emission tomograph with the help of FDG could provide valuable tumor information after the 6-week treatment. The laryngoscopy can be utilised to check the signs of cancer with a microscope inside the throat and voice box. The testing and analysis of tissues organs and cells called biopsy can be utilized to diagnosis the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. ==Treatment == Various treatments could be implemented to cure the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. Generally, treatments methods three basic methods: surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy and proton therapy, etc. === Surgery === Surgery can be implemented in all stages of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. The main goal of the surgery is to remove the tissue of cancer and some healthy tissues around the malignant tissue. The following therapy may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The types of surgery can be divided into different types method. The implementation of matxillectomy would mainly aim to remove part or all of the part of hard palate. The vacancy of the removed area can be filled by the prostheses or soft tissue. The extend surgery called skull nose surgery could be also utilized in the treatment of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer, more human tissue will be dislodged than the matxillectomy. Meanwhile, If a large part of the tissue was removed due to the surgery, the reconstructive surgery could be utilised to reconstruct the removed tissues by using artificial materials. When the doctor anticipate the cancer would spread to the neck, the neck dissection might be performed in order to remove the lymph nodes in the neck area, thereby stopping the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer spread. ===Proton therapy=== According to the result of experiment which utilized proton therapy to cure the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer were implemented started from January, 2007. the local diseases of 43 patients in total 48 patients(88%) were successfully controlled.Hoppe, B., Stegman, L., Zelefsky, M., Rosenzweig, K., Wolden, S., Patel, S., … Lee, N. (2007). Treatment of nasal cavity and paranasal sinus cancer with modern radiotherapy techniques in the postoperative setting—the MSKCC experience. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics, 67(3), 691–702. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.09.023 One patient were cured with additional following surgery. However, the brisk skin reactions occurred to all the patients after the whole proton therapy but were cured after the four weeks of the completion of proton therapy. The 1 year survival rate is 94% while the 2-years survival rate is 73%. === Radiation therapy === The radiation therapy aims to destroy the cancer cells by using the huge-energy x rays. It could be said that the radiation therapy is an effective method for the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer after the implementation of the surgery. The radiation therapy can also be seen as an alternative method for the patient who is unable to take the surgery. When it comes to the radiation therapy, the evolvement of the radiation therapy from conventional radiation therapy to the three-dimensional therapy and improved the accuracy of the distribution of the dose to the target tissues and made contributions the treatment of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. When compared to VMAT method, the radiation therapy provides a worse homogeneity and conformity for PTV. Jeong, Y., Lee, S., Kwak, J., Cho, I., Yoon, S., Kim, J., … Ahn, S. (2014). A Dosimetric Comparison of Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) and Non-Coplanar Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) for Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinus Cancer.

Toothy decay may caused by the radiation therapy. However, it may can be prevented by receiving a proper dentist treatment before the radiation therapy. The brisk skin reactions, redness of the skin may caused by the therapy. === Chemotherapy === Lastly, the chemotherapy can be defined as a treatment towards the cancer by using the medication to destroy the malignant cells. The chemotherapy is usually used before the surgery and radiation therapy or after the treatment of surgery and radiation therapy. The chemotherapy can be implemented by using the drugs to stop the spread of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer. The chemotherapy could make contribution to destroy the cancer cells or stop them from division. The chemotherapy could have effect on the cancer cell of the whole body by injecting into vein or taken by patient. The chemotherapy could influence a specific area by placing it into a specific area. Evidence shows that the chemotherapy could make also contribution to the treatment of sinonasal cancer which is a sub-branch of the paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancer.Fernström, E., Nyman, J., Hammerlid, E., Holmberg, E., Haugen-Cange, H., Petruson, K., … Björk-Eriksson, T.

Together with losses from water leaks in the piping, water theft is one of the major factors contributing to non-revenue water. Thames Water estimated losses by theft to amount to 2 to per year in 2017, flowing through 734 unauthorized connections. The basic controversy, however, of whether there can be such a thing as water theft (by individuals and for personal use, that is), is open. == Roman period == Water theft is not a new phenomenon. In Ancient Rome extensive networks of aqueducts provided a public supply of water to Roman cities. There was extensive theft from this system, often perpetrated by corrupt wateremen responsible for installing and maintaining supplies. Corrupt practices included stamping an incorrect size on a supply pipe so that the customer was charged for a smaller pipe than the one they actually obtained, secretly providing an unapproved supply (usually underground where it could not be seen) by puncturing the mains pipe, and a scam that involved providing a new pipe when a property changed hands. In the latter case, instead of simply transferring the existing account to the new occupier, a new pipe was installed from the water tower. The old pipe was kept by the fraudster who then sold on the water from it.Harry B. Evans, Water Distribution in Ancient Rome: The Evidence of Frontinus, pp. 45–47, University of Michigan Press, 1997 Some other dubious practices may sometimes have been due to incompetence, and sometimes deliberate fraud. Installing a connection lower down on the water tower provides a higher pressure, and therefore faster flow, than one of the same capacity stamp fitted higher up. Another issue was that the connection at the tower could be of the authorised size and correctly stamped, but a much larger pipe was connected to it. This will draw more water than the smaller pipe despite the connectors being the same size. During the first century, much more detailed water standards and practices were promulgated to address some of these issues. These included the requirement that not only the connectors, but also the pipes had to be stamped with their authorised size along their entire lengths at specified distances. The regulations on overflow water was also tightened up. Overflow occurs when the aqueduct is delivering water to the towers faster than it is being consumed. Watermen previously considered that selling this water was a perk of the job, but could now only be supplied to authorised persons. ==See also== *Leak *Right to water *Water scarcity *Water metering *Water wars, Water terrorism ==References== Category:Water supply ","title":"Water theft"},{"id":"60385729","text":"The LG Fiesta is an Android smartphone developed by LG Electronics that was launched in 2017.

It was formed on 1 April 2019, to take over some of the responsibilities of Forestry Commission Scotland, which was dissolved. The organisation exists alongside Scottish Forestry, also established on 1 April 2019, which is responsible for regulation, policy and support to landowners. Forestry and Land Scotland's key functions are to look after the national forest estate, including unforested land within this portfolio, and to produce and supply timber. Within this remit they are expected to enhance biodiversity, increase public access to the outdoors, encourage tourism and support the rural economy. The agency has been established initially to manage only the national forest estate, however it is intended that in future it may also take over management of other publicly owned land in Scotland. This could include land currently managed by other public bodies such as Crown Estate Scotland and NatureScot; crofting estates and agricultural land owned by the Scottish Government; land owned by local authorities; and land owned by the UK Ministry of Defence. ==Operation== As an executive agency of the Scottish Government Forestry and Land Scotland operates at arm's length from the Scottish Government, and is regulated by Scottish Forestry. It forms part of the Scottish Government's Environment and Forestry Directorate, and reports to the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Economy. FLS is headquartered in Inverness, and for organisational purposes it divides Scotland into five forest regions: *North, covering most of Highland and the island groups of Orkney, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides *West, covering Lochaber and the northern part of Argyll and Bute *East, covering the area from northern Fife to the Moray Firth *Central, covering the Central Belt, including southern Fife, southern Argyll and Bute, all of Lanarkshire and northern Ayrshire *South, covering southern Ayrshire, Dumfries and Galloway, the Scottish Borders and the Isle of Arran ==National forest estate== Glen Affric is a national nature reserve owned and managed by FLS. The national forest estate consists of land owned by the Scottish Government and managed by FLS. The estate covers 6,400 km2, being roughly 8% of the land area of Scotland. Around two-thirds of this land (4,700 km2) is forested, with the remaining land consisting of a mixture of agricultural land and open areas such as moorland. In line with the requirement to increase public access to the outdoors and encourage tourism FLS provide facilities such as car parks, picnic areas, paths and mountain bike trails at many of their forests, and as of 2008 the national forest estate received over ten million visitors each year. FLS is responsible for over 1200 km of paths for walkers, 1300 km of trails for cyclists, six forest parks, five woodland parks, four national nature reserves, and the mountain biking venues of the 7stanes. In 2015 it was estimated that national forest estate generated £395 million of Gross Value Added (GVA) for the Scottish economy each year, of which forestry and timber products accounted for £285 million, whilst tourism and recreation contributed £110 million. It was estimated that the estate supported 11,015 full-time equivalent jobs, of which 7,225 were in forestry and timber products and 3,790 were in recreation and tourism. As part of the Scottish Government's strategy for improving sustainability, benefiting communities, reducing the effects of climate change and maximising financial returns from the national forest estate FLS is actively supporting the generation of renewable energy from the estate. As of January 2019 the capacity of wind and hydro power generation installed on the national forest estate was 1086 MW. ==See also== *List of forests managed by Forestry and Land Scotland *Forestry in Scotland ==References== ==External links== *Forestry and Land Scotland - official website Category:Organisations based in Inverness Category:Environmental organisations based in Scotland Category:Forestry agencies in Scotland Category:Executive agencies of the Scottish Government ","title":"Forestry and Land Scotland"},{"id":"60385800","text":"Scottish Forestry () is the public body responsible for forestry regulation, policy and support to private landowners in Scotland.

They also do regional town hall meetings with invited speakers. Their slogan is \\"Down with dirty diesel\\". They believe that a rolling programme of electrification will vastly improve the UK Railways and at the same time help to decarbonise transport and improve the environment. They collaborate with the Railway Industry Association, the Rail Delivery Group and the BCRRE and the Campaign for Better Transport amongst others and have given evidence to the Transport Select Committee. The chairperson of that parliamentary committee at the time of formation of CEBR was Lilian Greenwood who supports their efforts. The new chairperson as of February 2020 is Huw Merriman. They also met with Tim Farron in September 2019 to campaign for electrification of the Lakes line and he supports their efforts. Other organisations such as the Institute of Electrical Engineers also hold conferences and seminars on the theme of railway electrification and thus also collaborate with Campaign to Electrify Britain's Railways. The Permanent Way Institution has done likewise. == Reason for inception == The decarbonization of transport, especially but not limited to London and urban areas is a stated UK government aim which seems to have all party support. In September 2019, Transport for Scotland announced the more aggressive goal of having Scottish transport net carbon neutral by the year 2035. This would be by a rolling programme of electrification and where that is not feasible by using battery and other emerging technology. The CEBR manifesto states: \\"The UK has suffered from too many boom and bust infrastructure projects. (This view is supported by others). A steady, planned, rolling programme will reduce costs, speed up journey times, create more seats on more reliable trains - and ultimately reduce ticket prices\\". The CEBR are a group of like-minded people who have started the campaign and have their own website and Twitter feed. In April 2019 they launched their own Facebook page too. They admit the campaign is relatively new and they don't have all the answers. They encourage anyone with any thoughts, ideas, questions or want to get involved to contact them. They staged a protest on top of Snowdon. In July 2019, the final report of the rail decarbonisation project was published. == Main campaign points == Many, but not all diesel trains use only friction brakes (as do cars and trucks) to slow or stop the train. This wears the discs and pads introducing particulates into the atmosphere. Electric trains predominantly use the motors in regeneration mode to slow the train, producing almost zero particulates. The technology does not yet exist to stop the train completely. This would improve the health of the nation but in particular for people who live closer to the railway. In addition, regenerative braking saves energy and is more efficient and thus helps the low-carbon economy. Diesel trains also generate soot and particulates from the engines, often clearly visible in the air. Electrification vastly reduces or even eliminates this problem thus bringing cleaner and healthier air. Electric power can be sourced from a diversified grid and thus reduce the effects of oil and geopolitics. Petroleum and petroleum based products were used as a weapon after the Yom Kippur War quadrupling the price of oil after an OPEC embargo. The Fuel protests in the United Kingdom particularly in the year 2000, virtually crippled UK transport and it was only a day away from bringing the diesel railway to a standstill. == Railway electrification in Great Britain == Railway electrification in Great Britain started in the late 19th century. After World War 2 and the nationalisation of the railways in 1948 and the 1955 Modernisation Plan, electrification commenced in earnest. There was a pause and then the West Coast Main Line north of Weaver Junction to just south of Glasgow was electrified in the 1970-1974 timeframe. Small amounts then followed and then a spurt of electrification activity occurred in the 1980s. There was then a lull in electrification activity in the mid 1990 to 2009 timeframe. In 2009, Lord Adonis was appointed Secretary of State for Transport. After a gap of more than a decade, electrification was back on the agenda and Adonis announced plans to electrify the Great Western Main Line from London as far as Swansea, as well as infill electrification schemes in the North West of England. In July 2012 the UK coalition government announced new electrification schemes, all at 25 kV AC and reconfirmed schemes previously announced by Adonis. Devolved rail transport in Scotland has allowed the Scottish government to pursue electrification with multiple schemes in the Central Belt. However, electrification has not been without controversy with horrendous cost overruns and late running schemes. This led to cancellations of projects and various appearances of the Secretary of State for Transport called before the Transport Select Committee. Shortly after this, Campaign to Electrify Britain's Railways was launched to try and mitigate the boom and bust cycle. == Future railway electrification in Great Britain == In an attempt to mitigate and improve the cost situation and thus persuade government to backtrack on its electrification cancellations, the Railway Industry Association published a report in March 2019 detailing why costs had risen and suggested ways forward. Campaign to Electrify Britain's Railways heavily circulated and advertised this report. The central message of this report is that electrification is the way forward and that costs can be contained by learning the lessons and having a rolling program of electrification rather than boom and bust/feast and famine cycles. The answer to a written question in parliament regarding route miles electrified in the years 1997-2019 made rather stark reading. Roger Ford the technical editor of Modern Railways often writes about similar themes and coined the phrase 'Bionic duckweed\\" to refer to schemes that are not based on electrification but alternative technologies such as biodiesel and Hydrogen. == See also == * Low-carbon economy * Decarbonisation measures in proposed UK electricity market reform * Committee on Climate Change * Fossil fuel phase-out * High Speed 2 * United Kingdom Climate Change Programme * History of rail transport in Great Britain 1995 to date * Extinction Rebellion == References == == External links == * Campaign to Electrify Britain's Railways Website * Birmingham CEBR Category:Electric rail transport Category:Climate change organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Emissions reduction Category:Rail infrastructure in the United Kingdom Great Britain ","title":"Campaign to Electrify Britain's Railways"},{"id":"60385807","text":"R.K Anand, (born 1 February 1961) is a politician from the Indian state of Manipur.

She is most well known for her sign language studies with Washoe the chimpanzee, who was the first ape to learn sign language. ==Early life and education == Gardner was born on July 13, 1933 in Vienna, Austria. She lived in Poland during Nazi rule, and moved with her family to a suburb in São Paulo, Brazil, to escape the Nazis. She and her family remained in Brazil for six years, at which point Beatrix moved to the United States to attend school. Beatrix, often spelled \\"Beatrice\\", attended Radcliffe College in Massachusetts and received her bachelor's degree in 1954. In 1956, she earned her master's degree from Brown University, working with Carl Pfaffman.https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas_Van_Cantfort/publication/269932364_BEATRIX_GARDNER_1933_-1995_HER_CONTRIBUTIONS_TO_DEVELOPMENTAL_PSYCHOBIOLOGY/links/549a1f070cf2b803713590ed.pdf She completed her PhD in zoology at Oxford University in 1959 where she studied under the mentorship of Niko Tinbergen. Her focus was studying food deprivation and feeding response in stickleback fish. ==Career== She used her ethological training background and applied it to psychobiology at Wellesley College, where she was hired to teach after Oxford. At Wellesley, she began studying children in comparison to adults, specifically with regard to their head shape. She found that a continuous transformation in head profile shape was an effective factor in determining how a person judged the \\"babyishness\\" of a head. At Wellesley, Beatrice met Allen Gardner. They met when they both attended a talk being given by Harry Harlow on his studies of contact comfort in infant rhesus macaque monkeys. In 1961, they married, and in 1963 they both took positions at the University of Nevada, Reno. There, Beatrice continued to use her ethological training and studied the effects of food deprivation in jumping spiders and predatory jumping spider behavior. In 1966, the Gardner and her husband acquired a 10-month-old chimpanzee that they named Washoe, who was named after the county in Nevada that they lived in. Gardner would become most well remembered for the work that she did with Washoe. Washoe was originally obtained by the US Air Force to use as a part of their space program, but she instead was sent to Gardner to participate in her study, which would try to teach Washoe American Sign Language (ASL). === Language learning with apes === Prior to Gardner's work with Washoe, there had been no successful teaching of language to any apes. There had been a couple of failed attempts at teaching vocal language to chimpanzees. Keith and Catherine Hayes attempted to teach an infant chimpanzee named Viki how to speak. At the end of their study, Viki was only able to form four words, and mostly they came out as sounds that she was able to mimic on command. This method of teaching language to apes lacked ethological validity, which Gardner was able to bring to the table, thanks to her background training from working with Niko Tinbergen. Together with her husband and a team of researchers that worked around the clock to raise Washoe using only ASL, Dr. Gardner was successful in teaching Washoe to use 250 different ASL signs, and she was able to use them in novel configurations. Due to the success of the project, Gardner continued to expand it by obtaining four infant chimpanzees named Moja, Pili, Tatu, and Dar. Gardner wanted to begin the sign language training from younger than 10 months old, which was Washoe's age when she was first acquired. She also wanted to raise these infant apes alongside each other to determine whether cultural transmission of signing would occur, or whether the apes would use sign language to communicate with one another. At this point, Washoe moved to the Institute of Primate Studies in Norman, Oklahoma, under the care of Roger and Deborah Fouts, who were two of the original researchers that had helped to raise Washoe. In 1980, Washoe moved with the Fouts to Ellensburg, Washington, where she lived out her life until she died in 2007 at the age of 42. === Controversy === There were several skeptics of the language training that Gardner was working on with Washoe. Not everyone believed that Washoe was truly using \\"language\\". Rather, they believed that Washoe was communicating using symbols that she associated with specific rewards, and they claimed that is why she would not use them conversationally. Herbert Terrace, a cognitive scientist at Columbia University, attempted to replicate the success of Washoe's training with another chimpanzee named Nim Chimpsky. Nim was able to learn ASL, but was raised in a true \\"laboratory\\" environment. This meant that instead of being raised in a nurturing and affectionate environment that many would argue is essential for human child development (and how Washoe was raised), Nim was raised in a controlled environment that lacked this component. Terrace claimed that Nim never spontaneously produced signs, nor did he use any grammar rules while signing. He was only able to communicate for food rewards. ==Honors and awards== Gardner became the president of the Rocky Mountain Psychological Association in 1994. She received the University of Reno National Institute of Mental Health Research Scientist Development Award. She was also a Sigma Xi National Lecturer. ==Personal life== Gardner had no children. She died while traveling in Italy with her husband at the age of 61 due to sepsis, and she left no immediate survivors other than her husband, Allen Gardner. ==Publications== * Tugendhat, B. (1960).

Calculators that implement TI-BASIC have a built in editor for writing programs. While the considerably faster Z80 assembly language is supported for the calculators, TI-BASIC's in-calculator editor and more user friendly syntax make it easier to use. TI-BASIC is interpreted. == Syntax == The syntax for TI-BASIC 83 is significantly different compared to most dialects of BASIC. For example, the language does not permit indentation with whitespace characters. It also depends on the TI calculator character set because it is tokenized. Aside from these differences, TI-BASIC retains most control flow statements: conditionals, various loops, GOTOs and Labels. Conditionals and loops use \`End\` to denote the end of their bodies. Each command can be placed on a new line, or separated by a colon for brevity. As such, the following snippets are identical in function. :disp \\"FOO :disp \\"BAR and :disp \\"FOO:disp \\"BAR In the above example the closing double quotes can be omitted because the colon causes all open markers to be closed. Unlike many high-level programming languages, TI-BASIC has only one assignment operator: \`→\`. The rightward arrow assigns the value on the left to the variable on the right. === Conditionals === TI-BASIC includes simple constructs using the \`If\` statement. When the \`If\` token does not have a \`Then\` token on the following line it will only execute the next single command. :If condition :command Where \`condition\` is any boolean statement. One benefit of this format is brevity as it does not include \`Then\` and \`End\`. An \`If\` statement may have more than one command in its body if, instead of a command, a \`Then\` token is placed. :If condition :Then :command :command :End When using \`Then\`, the body must be closed by an \`End\` token. One more construct utilizes \`Else\`. This allows one of two bodies to be executed. :If condition :Then :body one :Else :body two :End In this case the calculator evaluates \`condition\`, if it evaluates to true \`body one\` is executed, however, if \`condition\` evaluates to false, \`body two\` is executed. Unlike many other programming languages, TI-BASIC has no \`else if\` construct, or any switch statement. ==== Menu( statement ==== It does, however, have a \`Menu(\` statement which allows a user to select one of a number of options. Similar to a switch menus do have fallthrough. The general syntax is \`Menu(\`, a quoted title string, and followed by quoted option name and label name. An example: :Menu(\\"TITLE\\",\\"FIRST\\",1,\\"SECOND\\",2,\\"THIRD\\",3) :Lbl 1 :body one :Lbl 2 :body two :Lbl 3 :body three TI-84 Plus CE Menu example The image is how the calculator renders the example above. In terms of functionality, the \`Menu(\`'s flow is similar to some switch statement and cases, with a key difference that the user supplies the switch's usual expression. Like many switches and cases, the \`Lbl\` allows fall-through. For example, in the code above, if a user selects \\"FIRST\\", all three bodies are executed. However, selecting \\"SECOND\\" means only the second and third bodies are executed. === Loops === TI-BASIC includes three types of loops: \`For(\`, \`While\`, and \`Repeat\`. ==== For( ==== \`For(\` is similar to many other languages.

However, they have the unique property of changing the value of the given variable. :DS<(variable,value) :Command == Data types and variables == TI-BASIC is strongly and mostly statically typed. Most variables, besides lists and programs, have predefined names and allowed types. Each variable can usually only hold one data type, the exceptions are the numeric and all list variables which can hold either real or complex values. === Numeric === There are 27 numeric variables, \`A\` through \`Z\`, and \`θ\`. These can hold two types of values, real and complex. All numbers are stored in the RAM as floating-point numbers with 14-digit mantissa, or significand, and an exponent range of -128 to 127. Complex numbers are stored as two consecutive reals. === List === Lists are also supported through the use of six built-in lists, and user created lists with up to five characters as the name. They are capable of holding up to 999 elements. A list may hold entirely real numbers or entirely imaginary numbers. Some functions in the calculator are able to operate over entire lists, via Array programming. === Matrix === Matrices are supported through the use of ten built-in matrices. Matrices do not support user created names or complex numbers. === Other data types === The TI-83 family supports several more data types other than numeric, list, and matrix types: token based data, screen image data, and graph database data. These data types cannot be directly manipulated by TI-BASIC. == References == == External links == *Texas Instruments' official website *TI-Basic Developer, unofficial documentation Category:Calculators Category:Programming languages Category:BASIC programming language family ","title":"TI-BASIC 83"},{"id":"60386326","text":"Fields by the Sea (in French: Les Champs au bord de la mer) is an 1889 oil on canvas painting by Paul Gauguin. It is also called Landscape from Bretagne. The painting is exhibited at the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm. In the 1880s, Paul Gauguin occasionally went to Brittany, where he was taken by the landscape and local traditions. This painting shows an actual part of the coast, in a subjective interpretation where the decorative effects of colour fields and contours are the key element. The orange sections have shadows in a contrasting blue. This new style was called Synthetism. In autumn 1892, the artist Richard Bergh bought the painting from Gauguin's Danish wife. This painting inspired many Swedish artists. ==References== Category:Paintings by Paul Gauguin Category:1889 paintings Category:Landscape paintings Category:Paintings of the Nationalmuseum Stockholm ","title":"Fields by the Sea"},{"id":"60386346","text":"Piloctenus is a genus of wandering spiders first described by A.

He was elected to the position in the 2019 mayoral election. He previously served as the Mayor of Seferihisar, a coastal district of İzmir, from 2009 to 2019. ==Early life and education== Soyer was born in Ankara, the capital city of Turkey, in 1959. He graduated from Bornova Anadolu Lisesi, a prestigious high school in Bornova, a district of İzmir in which he received classes in foreign languages particularly in English and French before returning to Ankara to attend Ankara University Faculty of Law. He graduated in 1981. During his education, he was also an actor and assistant theatrical director. He completed two masters degrees, one in Webster University Geneva in the field of international relations and another at Dokuz Eylül University about the European Union. ==Political career== In addition to serving as Mayor of Seferihisar and İzmir, Soyer served as an advisor to the former mayor of İzmir, Ahmet Piriştina. He also served as the assistant general secretary and executive member for foreign relations in the İzmir Chamber of Commerce. He was the General Secretary for the EXPO 2015 Steering and Executive Committees. ===Mayor of Seferihisar=== Soyer was elected Mayor of Seferihisar, a coastal district of İzmir, in the 2009 local election. He was the candidate of the main opposition center-left Republican People's Party (CHP). He was re-elected for a second term in the 2014 local election. Soyer drew national attention for his success as Seferihisar mayor, having established the town as a modal tourist destination as part of the slow movement culture. Seferihisar became a member of Cittaslow, the first of its kind in Turkey.http://www.cittaslow.org/network/seferihisar Because of his success and popularity in Seferihisar, Soyer was frequently seen as a potential future candidate for Mayor of İzmir. ===Mayor of İzmir=== Following the announcement that the serving mayor of İzmir, Aziz Kocaoğlu, would not stand for another term, the CHP began considering new candidates. Despite Kocaoğlu deciding to re-enter the race shortly before the CHP was due to announce its candidate, Soyer was eventually selected, having long been seen as the frontrunner. Soyer was supported by the İYİ Party, with which the CHP formed an electoral alliance named the Nation Alliance. In the 2019 mayoral election, which was held as part of the 2019 local elections, Soyer was elected with 58.1% of the vote, beating the People's Alliance candidate Nihat Zeybekçi. Zeybekçi, a former Economy Minister, received 38.7% of the vote. ==Family and personal life== Soyer is married and has two kids. His wife, Neptün Soyer, worked in the tourism sector between 1999 and 2002.https://www.internethaber.com/tunc-soyer-esi-neptun-soyer-kimdir-kac- yasinda-ne-is-yapiyor-1937420h.htm ===Nurettin Soyer=== Soyer's father, Nurettin Soyer, was a prosecutor who took part in opening cases against prominent politicians following the 1980 coup d'état.

When Tunç Soyer became the CHP's candidate for Mayor of İzmir in 2019, the governing People's Alliance that includes the MHP sharply criticised him for his father's actions against nationalist politicians.

The area was annexed into Battle Creek in 1926. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. ==History== The first European settlement of this area was by Elias Manchester, who came to the area from New York state in 1836. He constructed a log cabin, and a few years later a brick house, located at what is now the corner of North Washington Avenue and Manchester Street. He platted a portion of his property into 66 lots known as \\"Manchester's Addition.\\" In 1852, lawyer and future Michigan Supreme Court Justice Benjamin F. Graves purchased the remainder of Manchester's farm. Around the same time, James Springer White and his wife Ellen G. White relocated the headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church to Battle Creek. A number of Seventh Day Adventist figures, including the Whites, made their homes in the district. In 1889 Graves platted a portion of it into 124 lots, known as \\"Graves's Addition,\\" and another section into 94 additional lots. The Manchester and Graves Additions together make up the Advent Historic District. Through the nineteenth century, the number of Adventists in the area grew, and by 1900 over 2000 Adventists lived in the neighborhood in and around the district. However, the church soon began decentralizing its activities, moving them to other communities, and as the twentieth century progressed, the number of Adventists living in the neighborhood gradually decreased. ==Description== The Advent Town Historic District consists of an irregularly shaped area spanning several blocks of what was formerly the village of Washington Heights. It includes 181 residences, 173 of which contribute to the historic character of the neighborhood. Most of the homes were built in the latter part of the 19th century and early part of the 20th. The houses in the district include Colonial Revival and American Foursquare residences of brick and stucco, clapboard-covered Bungalows, and stylish American Craftsman houses. They were primarily built as single family homes, although some have subsequently been converted into multi-family rental properties. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Calhoun County, Michigan Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Michigan Category:Late 19th and Early 20th Century American Movements architecture ","title":"Advent Historic District"},{"id":"60386976","text":"Monument to Forteguerri The Monument to Niccolò Fortiguerra is a marble statue of the Cardinal Fortiguerra, a prominent 15th-century benefactor of Pistoia, who endowed the city with a school for the indigent and a library (Biblioteca Forteguerriana).

The statue stands atop a simple high marble pedestal in the piazza of Santo Spirito, in Pistoia, region of Tuscany, Italy. ==History and description== Construction was patronized by a posthumous endowment in the 19th century by Niccolò Puccini, who was likely endeared to his fellow Pistoian, with whom he shares first name, for also being a philanthropist in causes for indigent children. He engaged the sculptor Cesare Sighinolfi to complete the larger-than-life statue which shows the Cardinal offering a document.

Ustaz Mutawasitah brings the trio to Kuala Lumpur to record music, but after two weeks Ustaz Mutawasitah has abandoned them, leaving them penniless and without most of their belongings.

When he first came to the United States, he could only speak French, and Guinean former basketball player Mamadi Diane was among those who helped him acclimate.

He showed promise when winning twice as a juvenile in 2016 and developed into a high- class handicapper in the following year. In 2018, he defeated a strong international field to take the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot at odds of 33/1. He failed to win in nine races as a five-year-old. ==Background== Accidental Agent is a bay gelding bred and owned by Gaie Johnson Houghton and trained by his owner's daughter Eve Johnson Houghton at Blewbury in Oxfordshire. He was named after John Goldsmith, Gaie Johnson Houghton's father. Goldsmith was a racehorse trainer and Special Operations Executive agent who wrote a book about his wartime experiences titled The Accidental Agent. As a yearling Accidental Agent was offered for sale at Tattersalls but was bought back by his owner when he failed to reach his reserve price. Eve Johnson Houghton later commented \\"He went through the sales ring and nobody even looked at him\\". The horse has been ridden in most of his races by Charles Bishop. He was probably the best horse sired by Delegator, a top-class sprinter-miler who finished second in the 2000 Guineas and won the Duke of York Stakes. Accidental Agent's dam Roodle showed modest ability on the track, winning two minor races for the Johnson Houghtons from 16 attempts. She was distantly descended in the female line from Satanella (foaled 1941) a British broodmare whose descendants have included Chief Singer, Pleasantly Perfect and Winged Love. ==Racing career== ===2016: two-year-old season=== Accidental Agent began his racing career in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Sandown Park on 13 July in which he started at odds of 7/1 and finished sixth of the sixteen runners. Eighteen days later at Chepstow Racecourse he started at odds of 9/2 for a similar event and recorded his first success, as he took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by one and three quarter lengths from Highland Lotus. The colt then carried 132 pounds in a nursery handicap at Goodwood Racecourse on 26 August in which he led for most of the way before being beaten a length into second place by Procurator. On 1 October at Newmarket Racecourse he was dropped back to six furlongs and went off at 14/1 for the Tattersalls October Auction Stakes, a valuable handicap race for juveniles offered for sale at Tatteralls as yearlings. The 26 runner field split into two groups, with Accidental Agent racing towards the rear of the group on the near side (the left side from the jockeys' viewpoint). He made rapid progress approaching the final furlong, took the lead in the closing stages and kept on strongly to win by a length from the filly Simmie. ===2017: three-year-old season=== On his first appearance of 2017 Accidental Agent ran fifth in a six furlong handicap at Doncaster Racecourse on 28 April and then finished seventh in a similar event over seven furlongs at Ascot Racecourse two weeks later. On 9 September the colt returned from a lengthy break in a seven furlong handicap on the synthetic polytrack surface at Kempton Park Racecourse and recorded his first success of the season, taking the lead in the final furlong and winning by one and three quarter lengths from Leontes. Later that month he was stepped up to Listed class for the Dubai Duty Free Cup over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in which he started a 16/1 outsider and finished strongly to take second place, a neck behind the four-year-old Tabarrak. On 7 October Accidental Agent carried 129 pounds in a valuable seven furlong handicap at Ascot and went off at 16/1 in an 18-runner field. After being restrained towards the rear by Bishop in the early stages he took the lead inside the final furlong and held off the late challenge of the four- year-old Lord Glitters to win by half a length. Two weeks later he came home fourth behind Lord Glitters in the one-mile Balmoral Handicap at the same track when attempting to concede five pounds to his older rival. On his final appearance of the year he started favourite for the Listed Hyde Stakes at Kempton in November but ran poorly and finished unplaced. ===2018: four-year- old season=== Accidental Agent commenced his third campaign in the Listed Paradise Stakes over one mile at Ascot on 2 May and started the 2/1 favourite against six opponents. He raced towards the rear for most of the way, and although he made some progress in the last quarter mile he never looked likely to win and finished third behind Century Dream and Crazy Horse. Seventeen days later at Newbury the colt contested his first Group race when he started the 66/1 outsider of the fourteen runners for the Group 1 Lockinge Stakes. He exceeded expectations as he kept on in the closing stages to take sixth place behind Rhododendron. On 19 June on good to firm ground at Royal Ascot Accidental Agent went off at odds of 33/1 for the Queen Anne Stakes. Benbatl started favourite, while the other thirteen runners included Rhododendron, Century Dream, Lord Glitters, Lightning Spear, Limato, Recoletos (Prix d'Ispahan), Yoshida (Turf Classic Stakes), Deauville (Belmont Derby) and Suedois (Shadwell Turf Mile Stakes). After racing towards the rear as Deauville set the pace, Accidental Agent began to make progress in the last quarter mile and joined the leaders in the final furlong. He gained the advantage in the closing stages and won by half a length from Lord Glitters with Lightning Spear, Century Dream, Yoshida and Beat The Bank finishing close behind. After the race Eve Johnson Houghton said \\"I thought I was tilting at windmills and I dreamt about being third. I thought, 'My God, I'm going to be placed.' There was an awful lot of screaming going on! It's just ridiculous. I have all my cousins and brothers and my mum here; I don't think she's ever going to get over it. He was bred by mum. My mum is the little woman in a flood of tears. What a legend she is. I am so proud of her and I had a little bit on at 50/1 to pay for the party.\\" In August Accidental Agent was sent to France to contest the Prix Jacques Le Marois over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse but never recovered from a poor start and came home eleventh of the twelve runners in a race won by Alpha Centauri. His final race of the season saw the horse dropped back to Group 2 class for the Joel Stakes at Newmarket on 22 September. He started slowly again and finished last of the five runners. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Accidental Agent was given a rating of 116 making him the 163rd best racehorse in the world. ===2019: five-year-old season=== Accidental Agent began his five-year-old season at Newbury on 18 May when he made a second attempt to win the Lockinge Stakes. He started a 33/1 outsider but ran better than his odds suggested as he stayed on well from the rear of the field to take third place behind Mustashry and Laurens. On 19 June he returned to Royal Ascot to attempt to win the Queen Anne Stakes for a second time but took no part in the race after refusing to start when the stalls opened. The horse finished last of eight behind Too Darn Hot in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood and was then dropped in class for the Group 3 Sovereign Stakes at Salisbury Racecourse on 15 August in which he was beaten a nose by the three-year-old Kick On after struggling to obtain a clear run in the last quarter mile. Nine days later he ran third in the Winter Hill Stakes at Windsor after which he underwent an operation to correct a breathing problem. Accidental Agent returned to the track on 19 October when he came home eleventh of the twelve runners behind King of Change in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. In November he was dropped back to Listed class but failed to recover his best form as he finished third in both the Ben Marshall Stakes at Newmarket and the Hyde Stakes at Kempton. In December he was gelded. ==Pedigree== == References == ==External links== * Career 1-2-3 Colour Chart – Accidental Agent Category:2014 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 16-a ","title":"Accidental Agent"},{"id":"60387393","text":"Yang Naisi (; 20 October 1927 – 5 March 2019), also known by his pen name Yang Daojing (), was a Chinese linguist and a research professor at the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

Its goals are to improve maternal and child health in Kenya, and to reduce new HIV infections among children. The campaign was unveiled in 2013 on World AIDS Day, and launched on 24 January 2014. Many international organizations have joined Kenyatta and the Kenyan government in supporting Beyond Zero. The campaign's first action was the donation of fully equipped mobile clinics to several counties in Kenya during the summer of 2014, beginning with Taita Taveta County. == Objectives == Beyond Zero has the overall goal of eliminating all preventable maternal and child deaths in Kenya by 2023. It has three primary objectives: * Raising awareness of the need for good maternal and child health and its relationship to a nation's strength and prosperity; * Mobilizing funds to support maternal, newborn and child health initiatives and to focus public attention on the challenges surrounding maternal, newborn and child health in Kenya; and * Educating women on the need for a healthy lifestyle, e.g. participating in sports, and encouraging them to adopt preventive health strategies. The initiative is a component of the Office of the First Lady's 2013-2017 Strategic Framework, which supports United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) #4 and #5. The strategic framework encompasses five key areas: # Accelerating the elimination of HIV. # Mobilizing funds in support of maternal health, child health, and HIV control initiatives. # Educating men in support of the Beyond Zero efforts as clients, partners, and agents of change. # Engaging communities to eliminate barriers to access to HIV, maternal and child health services. # Providing leadership, accountability, and recognition to accelerate the attainment of HIV, maternal and child health targets. == Partners and funding == Partners and funders have included: * The German Foundation for World Population * Concours d'Elegance * Madonna * Safaricom * GE Healthcare * Nation Media Group *Philips Africa The initiative is also supported by an annual half-marathon, in which Margaret Kenyatta runs. == Successes == Under the initiative, there has been a reduction of HIV infections among children from 12,000 cases in 2013 to 6,600 in 2016. The number of women delivering without skilled health workers dropped from 56% in 2013 to 34% in 2016. Maternal deaths decreased from 6,000 to 4,000. By January 2019, Beyond Zero had donated 52 fully equipped mobile clinics to the 47 counties in Kenya. Some counties received more than one clinic. == 2018 Expansion of Scope == The initiative expanded its scope in 2018 under the Second Strategic Framework of the Office of the First Lady (2018-2022) to add the following goals: * Enrolling pregnant women into Kenya's National Hospital Insurance Fund, under the Linda Mama program; * Supporting treatment of obstetric fistula; * Offering eye care for the elderly; * Registering and assessing children with intellectual impairment; * Making cancer screening available; and * Making available routine services such as HIV testing and counseling, immunization, and other health-related offerings. == Recognition == === National Recognition === * 2017: Beyond Zero won the Kifaru Award from the Kenya Council of Governors in the service delivery category. === International Recognition === * 2014: Margaret Kenyatta was designated UN Person of the Year for her efforts to eliminate preventable maternal and newborn deaths in the country through the ‘Beyond Zero’ campaign. * 2016: Beyond Zero received recognition as an East Africa Super Brand under the special category of Corporate Social Responsibility. It was celebrated as the initiative of the year. * 2017: Margaret Kenyatta received the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Fellow of Honoris Causa Award in recognition of her commitment to maternal and child health. * 2018: Margaret Kenyatta received the Eastern Africa Lifetime Achievement Award from the Ernst & Young group in recognition of her work with Beyond Zero. This award recognizes individuals who have initiated unique interventions that touch many lives. == Criticism == Beyond Zero has been criticized for under-funding its mobile clinics, leading to a shortage of personnel and basic supplies.

It was later identified as the first confirmed case of a tornado in Nepal. Lacking advanced technologies to predict or record a tornado, the scientists instead based their findings on forensic evidence, including witness accounts. The government has insisted that technological upgrades are being instituted to improve the country's virtually non-existent weather-warning system. The tornado originated in Chitwan National Park and followed a path wide and long through several villages in Bara and Parsa districts, accompanied by rain, hail and thunderstorm. The hydrology and meteorology department classified the wind as a gale at 30 knots. A humanitarian crisis ensued in the impoverished rural farming communities affected by the disaster. Emergency aid and response began soon after, with the Nepalese Army and Nepal Red Cross Society distributing supplies, while hospitals in the affected areas were overwhelmed with the number of injuries. Relief worth millions of rupees were announced for the victims in the aftermath of the tragedy. The government of Nepal also paid for the health expenses of all injured. ==Background== Prior to the 2019 event, no tornado had ever been officially confirmed in Nepal; the lack of such events is reflected by the Nepali language not having a word for \\"tornado\\". However, elderly residents in the Terai have a Maithili and Hindi word for tornado: chakrawat. Nepal has a limited meteorological network and records of past weather events are sparse. Some parts of the country had no log of data prior to 1956. In that year the India Meteorological Department established weather stations, later turning over responsibility to the Nepalese government in 1966. Concerted efforts to steadily expand the observation network began in the 1980s, with 60 rain gauges established by 1985. In 2019, the government built a Doppler weather radar in Surkhet and had plans for two more. Usage of weather balloons was also being tested. Hirohiko Ishikawa, a meteorologist at the Disaster Prevention Research Institute of Kyoto University stated there is a possibility of unrecorded tornadoes in the plains of southeastern of Nepal. A plausible tornado was reported in February 1968: a weather observer recalled a diameter \\"pillar of dust and rain\\" that traveled and caused extensive crop damage. Kiran Nepal of the Nepali Times asserts that the 2019 tornado was not the first of its kind and that prior events documented in literature and folklore were overlooked by media. The Ganges Basin to the south of Nepal occasionally sees tornadoes. Tornadoes in this region are most common during the pre- and post-monsoon months. The United States' National Centers for Environmental Information highlights an increased likelihood of tornadoes from Ganges Basin northwest along the southern slopes of the Himalayas, through Nepal, and into northeastern Pakistan. Reports of tornadoes in this region are primarily clustered in Bangladesh, with only sporadic events farther northwest. The pre-monsoon months (March to May) display the most favorable conditions for severe weather. During this time, convective available potential energy—an indicator of atmospheric instability whereby higher values denote a greater likelihood of thunderstorms—and wind shear are conducive to the development of rotating thunderstorms. Some of the deadliest tornadoes on record occur in these areas; one such tornado in 1989 killed an estimated 1,300 people in Bangladesh's Manikganj District. Before the tornado on March 31, the meteorological division of Nepal had issued a general forecast of possible rain for a large region, but it lacks the ability to determine the exact nature, strength or location of an incoming storm. The Indian Department of Meteorology had also issued a warning against strong winds in the neighbouring areas across the border. The rural farming communities hit by the storm live mostly in huts made of mud,grass and bamboo sticks. Electric transmission lines have been built to pass through residential areas or vice versa with little regard for safety and regulations. On the evening of the storm, most of the families were gathered in their homes and getting ready for dinner. Some people were still on the road trying to make it home. ==Events== On 31 March 2019, at around 07:45 pm local time (GMT +5:45), a supercell thunderstorm spawned a strong tornado in the Chitwan National Park which swept through the districts of Bara and Parsa in southern Nepal. Traveling along a path-- of it visible from space --and reaching a maximum width of , it ravaged many rural communities in the two districts for a half hour, wreaking havoc. Hardest-hit were the villages of Bharbalia, Parwanipur, and Pheta in Bara. A total of 1,273 homes were destroyed and a further 1,348 sustained damage. Many of these homes were poorly constructed, though multiple well-built masonry homes were completely destroyed as well. The majority of damage took place in Bara where 1,183 homes were destroyed. In some instances, concrete slabs were shifted and cars were blown away. Numerous trees were snapped and denuded, and a mosque was leveled. In Pheta rural municipality of Bara district alone, 26 people lost their lives from falling bricks and roofs, being buried under rubble or getting crushed by uprooted trees, electric poles or pylons. Many more were injured on the road when buses and private transports were blown or toppled over. Many families lost their food stock, clothes and other essentials in the rubble when their homes were destroyed. Official figures put the death toll at 28 (27 in Bara and 1 in Parsa) The actual numbers were reported to be as high as 50. The tornado also injured 1,176 people and a total of 3,291 families were reported affected. of crops were destroyed and were damaged. Dozens of livestock and 5,000 hens were killed. Total damage from the tornado and the parent thunderstorm reached Rs.90 million (US$800,000). ==Aftermath== Severe tornado damage to homes in Bara. At 10:37 pm, Prime minister KP Sharma Oli informed the world of the disaster via a tweet. He also informed that security personnel had already been deployed for rescue. On 1 April, 9 critically injured were airlifted to Kathmandu in Nepal Army's sky truck and M17 chopper. The security personnel, members of the civil service, medical personnel, volunteers, politicians and public office holders as well as organisations like Red Cross participated in search and rescue efforts. Medical teams from Nepal army, the Red Cross and local hospitals treated the injured. The provincial government announced cash relief worth 300,000 rupees per casualty to the surviving family members of each dead. It also urged the federal government to announce a state of emergency in the affected areas. The prime minister inspected the damage by visiting the affected areas. The Government of Nepal declared a state of emergency on 1 April 2019. The Nepalese Army placed a helicopter on standby for relief efforts soon after the tornado; however, continued bad weather inhibited its use. Two ground units were deployed with aid and reached affected communities on the morning of 1 April. The Ministry of Home Affairs provided 468 sets of tents and tarpaulins and 4,138 units of clothing. The Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) distributed food and emergency items, with the Chitwan District chapter providing of beaten rice, of puffed rice, and 15 cartons of noodles. Bagmati Pradesh provided Rs.10 million (US$90,000) to Province No. 2. The Nepalese Army established tent cities to accommodate displaced persons; however, living conditions became difficult with temperatures reaching in the following weeks. Local hospitals in Bara were overwhelmed with the number of injured persons and ran out of beds. Floor mattresses were used to accommodate additional victims. Kalaiya Hospital in Bara, which was understaffed and without power, received 354 patients; two spinal injury victims were transferred to Kathmandu and eight with head injuries were moved to Birganj. Mountain Heart Nepal established a clinic in Kalaiya and treated 160 people by 4 April. The Parsa chapter of the NRCS collected 300 pints of blood from donation centers to support injury treatment. Humanity & Inclusion distributed mobility aid to assist victims with rehabilitation. Doctors at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division noted an increased risk of diseases with people left homeless, a lack of clean water, dead animals out in the open, and an abundance of mosquitos. Numerous irregularities were observed in the distribution of relief materials to the affected villages. Consequently, District Administration Office of Bara had to enforce stringent measures. Many of the victims reported that they never received any relief while the influential people had hogged all the relief materials intended for them. Victims were critical of famous people flying into affected regions to take selfies of themselves distributing relief goods. The Pathlaiya-Birganj road became gridlocked with people bringing in aid and/or coming in to see the damage firsthand. Members of the Canadian Centre for International Studies and Cooperation in Nepal assisted in damage assessment and the needs of victims. With assistance from the Government of Australia and the United Nations Population Fund, WOREC Nepal established psychosocial counseling for women in Devtaal, Parwanipur, Pheta and Suvarna. ==Scientific analysis== A team of researchers from The Small Earth Nepal and the country's Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) collaborated on a review of the damage. Reports of \\"spinning winds\\" from locals prompted Archana Shrestha, a meteorologist at the DHM, to investigate. The team conducted a four-day survey of affected towns, documenting and measuring damage. They also utilized imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellite and geolocated social media posts to compile a complete picture. Their results indicated a \\"weak to moderately strong tornado\\" with winds between . With the help of forensic evidence, including satellite and drone images, as well as eye-witness accounts, a group of scientists concluded that the event was actually a tornado. ==See also== *2019 in Nepal *Tornadoes of 2019 ==References== tornado Category:2019 meteorology Category:Tornadoes of 2019 Category:March 2019 events in Asia tornado tornado ","title":"March 2019 southern Nepal tornado"},{"id":"60387922","text":"Dimitar Galinchev (born 15 September 1938) is a Bulgarian wrestler.

He took up guitar at an early age and was inspired to explore Charles Mingus by Jeff Beck's cover of \\"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\\" on his album Wired. This led to albums by Miles Davis and John Coltrane which expanded Baggetta's sense of musical adventure. Baggetta attended Rutgers University where he received his Bachelor of Music degree and Master of Music degree in Jazz Studies. After graduation, he moved to New York City and embarked on a music career. After fifteen years in NYC, Baggetta relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee. ==Career== Baggetta was a finalist in the Fish Middleton Jazz Scholarship competition at the East Coast Jazz Festival and was one of seven international guitarists to compete in the Gibson Jazz Guitar Competition at the Montreux Jazz Festival. In Knoxville, Baggetta began performing completely instrumental improvisational interpretations of Patsy Cline songs. He also performed the music of Ornette Coleman. Baggetta has performed with Jerome Harris, David Torn, Darcy James Argue, Satoshi Takeishi, Donny McCaslin, Dominique Eade, and Nels Cline. As a young guitarist, Baggetta has played along with records by Minutemen bassist Mike Watt as well as records featuring drummer Jim Keltner. A conversation with Chris Schlarb of Big Ego Studios led to a discussion about the David Torn album Cloud About Mercury which Baggetta admired. Baggetta learned that the artists on the album hadn't worked together previously and were simply cold- called by Torn so he jokingly suggested Schlarb call Watt and Keltner to join him for an album. Schlarb made some calls and soon enough Baggetta was joined by Watt and Keltner to record his Wall of Flowers album which was released in March 2019. Following the release of the album, Baggetta and Watt embarked on a ten date March tour with Stephen Hodges substituting for Keltner. Baggetta, Watt and Hodges call themselves mssv and their debut live album, Live Flowers, was released December 1, 2019. ==Discography== * There, Just as You Look for It with Kris Tiner (pfMentum, 2005) * And Begin Again with Kris Tiner (Evander, 2007) * Small Spaces (Fresh Sound, 2008) * Canto (Mabnotes Music, 2010) * Source Material (Fresh Sound, 2010) * Bridges with Kris Tiner(Mabnotes Music, 2011) * Thieves and Secrets (Fresh Sound, 2013) * Spectre (2016) * Wall of Flowers (Big Ego, 2019) * Live Flowers (2019) ==References== Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Avant-garde jazz musicians Category:American male composers Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:21st-century American guitarists Category:American jazz guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:20th-century American composers Category:American male jazz musicians Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:21st-century American male musicians ","title":"Mike Baggetta"},{"id":"60388099","text":"Yechiel Michel ben Eliezer ha-Kohen (; died 10 or 12 June 1648), also known as the Martyr of Nemirov, was a kabbalist and rabbi at Nemirov, Russia who was murdered during the Cossacks' Uprising of 1648. ==Biography== Yechiel Michel was the son of the gaon Rabbi Eliezer of Zlatschov. Said to know the entire Torah by heart, Yechiel was known for his mastery of talmudic, kabbalistic, and secular knowledge. Yechiel at first regarded the Khmelnytsky persecutions as a presage of the coming messianic era. In a sermon on the Shabbat before the Cossack riots, he admonished members of the Jewish community to be martyred rather than forcibly converted to Christianity. When the hordes of Khmelnytsky, taking Nemirov, began the work of pillage and massacre, a Cossack concealed Yechiel, hoping that the latter would disclose where the Jews had hidden their wealth. Yechiel was found by a Ukrainian shoemaker and clubbed to death in the Jewish cemetery on 10 or 12 June 1648. He was mourned by Rabbis Shabbatai HaKohen and Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller in their elegies for the victims of the Khmelnytsky massacres of 1648–1649. Yechiel was the author of a work entitled Shivrei luḥot ('Fragments of the Tablets'), containing kabbalistic commentary on several Sabbatic sections and the weekly Torah readings given in the Talmud. The work was published posthumously at Lublin in 1680 by Yechiel's nephew, whose introduction includes Jewish accounts of the Cossacks' Uprising. A new edition of the work was published by Rabbi Abraham Baruch Alter Rosenberg in 1913. ==See also== * Martyrdom in Judaism ==References== Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1648 deaths Category:17th-century rabbis Category:Bible commentators Category:Imperial Russian Orthodox rabbis Category:Jewish martyrs Category:Kabbalists Category:Khmelnytsky Uprising Category:Kohanim writers of Rabbinic literature Category:People from Nemyriv Category:People murdered in Ukraine Category:Ukrainian Orthodox rabbis ","title":"Yechiel Michel ben Eliezer"},{"id":"60388105","text":"Distant Past may refer to: *\\"Distant Past\\" (song), by Everything Everything * Distant Past (album), by Monster Magnet (2001) *Distant Past (Desperate Housewives) ","title":"Distant Past"},{"id":"60388137","text":"Jonathan Newdick, artist and illustrator, was born in Newbury in 1948, and was brought up in the rural South of England.

It is also one of the two official languages in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Changbai Korean Autonomous County of Jilin province, China.

Should the team take the field, it may begin playing in Moncton, New Brunswick, before moving into a new stadium in the Dartmouth community of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The team has the same name as a conditional CFL franchise that was granted by the league in 1982 only to fold the following year without playing a game. As with the original Schooners franchise, the most significant impediment to the current application is believed to be the ability to secure funding for a new stadium. ==History== === 2017 === In November, the CFL conducted discussions with a group in Halifax interested in securing a franchise for the city; the group made a \\"very credible\\" pitch to the CFL head office. According to TSN analyst Dave Naylor the group consists of Anthony LeBlanc (former president and CEO of the NHL's Arizona Coyotes), Bruce Bowser (president of AMJ Campbell Van Lines) and Gary Drummond (former president of hockey operations for the Coyotes). === 2018 === In June, the ownership group, which was then named Maritime Football Ltd., met with Premier of New Brunswick Brian Gallant and Moncton mayor Dawn Arnold, to discuss the possibility of a Halifax team playing some games in Moncton. Later that month, the group met with the Halifax Regional Council in private about plans to bring a CFL team to Halifax, with the possibility of playing at Université de Moncton while a stadium in Halifax is being built. The possible stadium locations were narrowed down to two sites, in Dartmouth Crossing and Bayers Lake Business Park. It was then revealed that the Maritime Football Ltd. ownership group preferred the Shannon Park location in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia to develop a new stadium. The stadium was estimated to cost between $170 and $190 million and would seat 24,000 and have a business model similar to the Ottawa Redblacks, who entered the league in 2014. On October 30, Halifax City Council unanimously voted in favour of proceeding with a business case analysis of a stadium in the Halifax municipality. Following this positive momentum, Maritime Football Ltd. and CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie announced that the group would proceed with a season ticket drive to further gauge interest in addition to running a team name contest in the hopes of making an announcement on the team name just prior to the 106th Grey Cup game. The target year for the proposed team to enter the league would be 2021, with the team name including the word \\"Atlantic\\", but no franchise was actually awarded in this announcement. Further to the previous discussions with Moncton and New Brunswick politicians, it was also suggested that the potential new franchise could begin play at Croix-Bleue Medavie Stadium in Moncton, which has previously hosted CFL matches, while the stadium in Halifax is built. On November 23, two days before the 106th Grey Cup, Maritime Football Ltd. and commissioner Ambrosie announced the new team would be called the 'Atlantic Schooners,' the same name adopted by the ill-fated conditional franchise of the early 1980s that folded without playing a game. At that time the Maritime Football Ltd. partnership changed their name to Schooners Sports and Entertainment (SSE). By December 21, the SSE had sold over 6,000 season ticket deposits. === 2019 === In early February, it was revealed the proposed stadium budget of $180 million had been scaled back to $130 million, reducing the extravagance of the design to a simple stadium which could be improved in future renovations. In late September 2019 the SSE and the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) revealed the final plans for the stadium, with a price tag of $94 million plus the purchasing of the land valued at $10 million. The stadium will include 24,000 seats, half of which are permanent. The planned completion date for construction is June 1, 2022. On October 22, the Halifax council voted 9–8 in favour of proceeding with the HRM staff preparing a review of the stadium proposal. Additionally, the timeline to deliver the report was accelerated from the spring of 2020 to December 2019. On December 6, the staff of the HRM recommended the rejection of the proposed Shannon Park location in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, citing a lack of transportation infrastructure. The report did however, recommend offering a one-time payment of $20 million once a potential stadium at a different location is near completion. On December 10, the Halifax Regional Council voted 10–7 in favour of approving $20 million in conditional funding for the stadium elsewhere in the city. ==See also== * Touchdown Atlantic * CFL Expansion == References == == External links == *Official Website *Official Stadium Proposal - September 22, 2019 Category:Sports teams in Nova Scotia Category:Sport in Halifax, Nova Scotia ","title":"Schooners Sports and Entertainment"},{"id":"60388470","text":"Twin River Worldwide Holdings is a gaming company based in Lincoln, Rhode Island. It owns and operates ten casino and racetrack properties in Colorado, Delaware, Mississippi, Missouri, and Rhode Island. ==History== Twin River's predecessor was BLB Investors. BLB was formed in 2004 as a joint venture of Starwood Capital Group, Kerzner International, and the Waterford Group to launch a bid to acquire Wembley plc. Wembley was a British operator of racetracks in the United Kingdom and United States, whose primary asset was Lincoln Park, a greyhound track and slot machine parlor in Rhode Island. BLB ultimately reached a deal in February 2005 to pay $435 million for Lincoln Park, plus $20 million for Wembley's other U.S. properties, comprising a horse track (Arapahoe Park) and three greyhound tracks in Colorado. The purchase was completed in July 2005. BLB undertook a $220-million expansion of Lincoln Park and renamed it in 2007 as Twin River. By 2008, BLB was struggling because of the economic slowdown, and it began defaulting on payments on the loans it had taken out to buy and renovate Twin River. In June 2009, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with a prepackaged plan to hand over ownership to its creditors. BLB emerged from bankruptcy in 2010, now owned by a group of lenders led by Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Sankaty Advisors. The company changed its name to Twin River Worldwide Holdings in 2011. In Colorado, the company's three dog racing tracks closed as interest in the sport declined, and all three were sold off by 2011. In 2014, Twin River bought the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Biloxi in Mississippi from Leucadia National for $250 million. The acquisition was made to diversify the company geographically, in preparation for expected competition from Massachusetts, which had legalized casinos in 2011. In 2015, Twin River purchased Rhode Island's only other casino, the Newport Grand, for $22 million, and announced plans to move its operations to a new facility to be built in Tiverton. The Newport Grand closed in 2018, and its replacement, the $140-million Tiverton Casino Hotel, opened days later. In March 2019, Twin River completed a reverse merger with Dover Downs Gaming & Entertainment, the parent company of Dover Downs Hotel & Casino. The transaction made Twin River a public company traded on the New York Stock Exchange and left Dover Downs shareholders with a 7 percent stake in the combined company. In January 2020, Twin River purchased three casinos in Black Hawk, Colorado (the Golden Gates, Golden Gulch, and Mardi Gras) from Affinity Gaming for $51 million. In April 2020, Twin River announced a deal with Caesars Entertainment and Vici Properties to purchase Bally's Atlantic City in New Jersey, and a separate deal with Eldorado Resorts to buy Eldorado Shreveport Resort and Casino in Louisiana, and MontBleu Resort Casino & Spa in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.https://www.inquirer.com/news/ballys- atlantic-city-sale-acquisition-twin-river-caesars- vici-20200424.htmlhttps://www.kolotv.com/content/news/Eldorado-Resorts- selling-Montbleau-casino-at- Stateline-569929791.htmlhttps://www.nevadaappeal.com/news/eldorado-resorts-to- sell-tahoes-montbleu-louisiana-casino-for-155-million/ In July 2020, Twin River bought two casinos in Missouri and Mississippi (Isle of Capri Casino Kansas City and Lady Luck Casino Vicksburg) from Eldorado Resorts for $230 million.

For a steamship, this would be a boiler room supplying steam to an engine room. There might also be a gearing room that housed the transmission that actually turned the propeller shaft(s). Ideally each \\"unit\\" should have an additional compartment between them to further reduce the risk. Many ships were able to provide steam via cross-connections from either boiler room to either engine room.Brown, p. 163 The unit system was developed during World War I to help mitigate damage and flooding from damage inflicted by a weapon and to preserve a ship's mobility by physically separating the engines and boilers into at least two groups so that a single torpedo hit, for example, could not flood all of the boiler or engine rooms, disabling all of the ship's propulsion machinery. A single World War II torpedo hit would typically blow a hole in the hull and would compromise the integrity of adjacent watertight bulkheads over twice that length and further if the ship was of riveted construction rather than welded. This would usually flood two compartments and possibly three.Brown, pp. 163–164 The unit system invariably added length to accommodate the additional piping to cross-connect the engines and boilers and the widely separated boilers required two funnels which reduced the fields of fire of the ship's anti-aircraft guns and added topweight. There could be significant knock-on costs as well. For example, the second batch of the British Leander-class light cruisers of the 1930s (which were all eventually sold to Australia) were modified to use the unit system. This increased the length of the machinery spaces by and the waterline belt armor needed to protect the boilers increased by a length of . The extra weight of the armor required the beam to be increased by to preserve stability.

A channel system is similar to a pushdown automaton where a queue is used instead of a stack. Those queues are called channels. Intuitively, each channel represents a sequence a message to be sent, and to be read in the order in which they are sent. == Definition == === Channel system === Formally, a channel system (or perfect channel system) S is defined as a tuple \\\\langle Q,C,\\\\Sigma,\\\\Delta \\\\rangle with: * Q=\\\\\\\\{q_1,\\\\dots,q_m\\\\\\\\} a finite set of control states, * q_0\\\\in Q an initial state, * A a finite alphabet (for the sake of notation simplicity, let \\\\epsilon \\\\in A), * C=\\\\\\\\{c_1,\\\\dots,c_n\\\\\\\\} a finite set of channels, * \\\\Sigma=\\\\\\\\{a_1,\\\\dots,a_p\\\\\\\\} a finite alphabet of messages, * \\\\Delta\\\\subseteq Q\\\\times C\\\\times\\\\\\\\{?,!\\\\\\\\}\\\\times\\\\Sigma^*\\\\times A \\\\times Q a finite set of transition rules with \\\\Sigma^* being the set of finite (potentially empty) words over the alphabet \\\\Sigma. Depending of the author, a channel system may have no initial state and may have an empty alphabet. === Configuration === A configuration or global state of the channel system is a n+1 tuple belonging to Q\\\\times\\\\prod_{i=1}^n(\\\\Sigma^*). Intuitively, a configuration \\\\gamma=(q,w_1,\\\\dots,w_m) represents that a run is in state q and that its i-th channel contains the word w_i. The initial configuration is (q_0,\\\\epsilon,\\\\dots,\\\\epsilon), with \\\\epsilon the empty word. === Step === Intuitively, a transition (q,c_i,!,u,a,q') means that the system may goes to control state q to q' by writing an u to the end of the channel c_i. Similarly (q,c_i,?,u,a,q') means that the system may goes to control state q to q' by removing a u starting the word c_i. Formally, given a configuration (q,w_1,\\\\dots,w_m), and a transition (q,c_i,!,u,q'), there is a perfect step (q,w_1,\\\\dots, w_{i-1}, w_i, w_{i+1},\\\\dots,w_m)\\\\xrightarrow{a}_{\\\\mathtt{perf}}(q',w_1,\\\\dots,w_{i-1},w_iu,w_{i+1},\\\\dots,w_m), where the step adds a letter u to the end of the i-th word. Similarly, given a transition (q,c_i,?,u,q'), there is a perfect step (q,w_1,\\\\dots,w_{i-1},uw_i,w_{i+1},w_m)\\\\xrightarrow{a}_{\\\\mathtt{perf}}(q',w_1,\\\\dots,w_{i-1}, w_i, w_{i+1},\\\\dots,w_m) where the first letter of the i-th word is u and has been removed during the step. === Run === A perfect run is a sequence of perfect step, of the form \\\\gamma_0\\\\xrightarrow{a_0}_{\\\\mathtt{perf}}\\\\gamma_1\\\\dots. We let \\\\gamma\\\\xrightarrow[\\\\mathtt{perf}]{*}\\\\gamma' denote that there is a perfect run starting at \\\\gamma and ending at \\\\gamma'. === Languages === Given a perfect or a lossy channel system S, multiple languages may be defined. A word over A^* is accepted by S if it is the concatenation of the labels of a run of S. The language defined by S is the set of words accepted by S. The set of reachable configuration of S, denoted R(S) is defined as the set of configuration \\\\gamma reachable from the initial state. I.e. as the set of configurations \\\\gamma' such that (q_0,\\\\epsilon,\\\\dots,\\\\epsilon)\\\\xrightarrow{*}\\\\gamma'. Given a channel c, the channel of c is the set of tuples (w_1,\\\\dots w_m) such that (c,w_1,\\\\dots,w_m)\\\\in R(S). == Channel system and Turing machine == Most problem related to perfect channel system are undecidable. This is due to the fact that such a machine may simulates the run of a Turing machine. This simulation is now sketched. Given a Turing machine M, there exists a perfect channel system S such that any run of M of length n can be simulated by a run of S of length O(n^2). Intuitively, this simulation consists simply in having the entire tape of the simulated Turing machine in a channel. The content channel is then entirely read and immediately rewritten in the channel, with one exception, the part of the content representing the head of the Turing machine is changed, to simulate a step of the Turing machine computation. == Variants == Multiple variants of channel systems have been introduced. The two variants introduced below does not allow to simulate a Turing machine and thus allows multiple problem of interest to be decidable. === One channel machine === A one-channel machine is a channel system using a single channel. The same definition also applies for all variants of channel system. === Counter machine === When the alphabet of a channel system contains a single message, then each channel is essentially a counter. It follows that those systems are essentially Minsky machines. We call such systems counter machines. This same definition applies for all variants of channel system. === Completely specified protocol === A completely specified protocol (CSP) is defined exactly as a channel system. However, the notion of step and of run are defined differently. A CSP admits two kinds of steps. Perfect steps, as defined above, and a message loss transition step. We denote a message loss transition step by (q,w_1,\\\\dots,a\\\\cdot w_i,\\\\dots,w_m)\\\\rightsquigarrow(q,w_1,\\\\dots,w_i,\\\\dots,w_m). === Looseness === A lossy channel system or machine capable of lossiness error is an extension of completely specified protocol in which letters may disappear anywhere. A lossy channel system admits two kinds of steps. Perfect steps, as defined above, and lossy step. We denote a lossy step, (q,w_1,\\\\dots,w_i\\\\cdot a\\\\cdot w'_i\\\\dots,,w_m)\\\\rightsquigarrow(q,w_1,\\\\dots,w_i\\\\cdot w'_i,w'_m). A run in which channel are emptied as soon as messages are sent into them is a valid run according to this definition. For this reason, some fairness conditions may be introduced to those systems. ==== Channel fairness ==== Given a message a channel c, a run is said to be channel fair with respect to c if, assuming there are infinitely many steps in which a letter is sent to c then there are infinitely many steps in which a letter is read from c. A computation is said to be channel fair if it is channel fair with respect to each channel c.  Impartiality  The impartiality condition is a restriction to the channel fairness condition in which both the channel and the letter are considered. Given a message m and a channel c, a run is said to be impartial with respect to c and m if, assuming there are infinitely many steps in which m is sent to c then there are infinitely many steps in which m is read from c. A computation is said to be impartial with respect to a channel c if it is impartial with respect to c and a messages m. It is said to be impartial if it is impartial with respect to every channels c.  Message fairness  The message fairness property is similar to impartiality, but the condition only have to hold if there is an infinite number of step at which m may be read. Formally, a run is said to be message faire with respect to c and m if, assuming there are infinitely many steps in which m is sent to c, and infinitely many step i which occurs in a state q such that there exists a transition (q,m,q'), then there are infinitely many steps in which m is read from c.  Boundedness  The run is said to have bounded lossiness if the number of letter removed between two perfect steps is bounded. === Insertion of errors === A machine capable of insertion of error is an extension of channel system in which letters may appear anywhere. A machine capable of insertion of error admits two kinds of steps. Perfect steps, as defined above, and insertion steps. We denote an insertion step by (q,w_1,\\\\dots,w_i\\\\cdot w'_i\\\\dots,,w_m)\\\\rightsquigarrow(q,w_1,\\\\dots,w_i\\\\cdot a\\\\cdot w'_i,w'_m). === Duplication errors === A machine capable of duplication error is an extension of machine capable of insertion of error in which the inserted letter is a copy of the previous letter. A machine capable of insertion of error admits two kinds of steps. Perfect steps, as defined above, and duplication steps. We denote an insertion step by (q,w_1,\\\\dots,w_i\\\\cdot a\\\\cdot w'_i\\\\dots,,w_m)\\\\rightsquigarrow(q,w_1,\\\\dots,w_i\\\\cdot a\\\\cdot a\\\\cdot w'_i,w'_m). A non-duplicate machine capable of duplication error is a machine which ensures that in each channel, the letters alternate between a special new letter #, and a regular letter from the alphabet of message. If it is not the caes, it means a duplication occurred and the run rejects. This process allow to encode any channel system into a machine capable of duplication error, while forcing it not to have errors. Since channel systems can simulate machines, it follows that machines capable of duplication error can simulate Turing machine. == Properties == The set of reachable configurations is recognizable for lossy channel machines and machines capable of insertions of errors. It is recursively enumerable for machine capable of duplication error. == Problems and their complexity == This section contain a list of problems over channel system, and their decidability of complexity over variants of such systems. === Termination problem === The termination problem consists in deciding, given a channel system S and an initial configuration \\\\gamma whether all runs of S starting at \\\\gamma are finite. This problem is undecidable over perfect channel systems, even when the system is a counter machine or when it is a one-channel machine. This problem is decidable but nonprimitive recursive over lossy channel system. This problem is trivially decidable over machine capable of insertion of errors. === Reachability problem === The reachability problem consists in deciding, given a channel system S and two initial configurations \\\\gamma and \\\\gamma' whether there is a run of S from \\\\gamma to \\\\gamma'. This problem is undecidable over perfect channel systems and decidable but nonprimitive recursive over lossy channel system. This problem is decidable over machine capable of insertion of errors . === Reachability problem === The deadlock problem consists in deciding whether there is a reachable configuration without successor. This problem is decidable over lossy channel system and trivially decidable over machine capable of insertion of errors. It is also decidable over counter machine. === Model checking problem === The model checking problem consists in deciding whether given a system S and a CTL**-formula or a LTL-formula \\\\phi or a whether the language defined by S satisfies \\\\phi. This problem is undecidable over lossy channel system. === Recurrent state problem === The recurrent state problem consists in deciding, given a channel system S and an initial configuration \\\\gamma and a state s whether there exists a run of S, starting at \\\\gamma, going infinitely often through state s. This problem is undecidable over lossy channel system, even with a single channel. === Equivalent finite state machine === Given a system S, there is no algorithm which computes a finite state machine representing R(S) for the class of lossy channel system. This problem is decidable over machine capable of insertion of error . === Boundedness problem === The boundedness problem consists in deciding whether the set of reachable configuration is finite. I.e. the length of the content of each channel is bounded. This problem is trivially decidable over machine capable of insertion of errors. It is also decidable over counter machine. === Eventually properties === The eventuality property, or inevitability property problem consists in deciding, given a channel system S and a set \\\\Gamma of configurations whether all run of S starting at \\\\gamma goes through a configuration of \\\\Gamma. This problem is undecidable for lossy channel system with impartiality and with the two other fairness constraints. === Safety property === The safety property problem consists in deciding, given a channel system S and a regular set R whether === Structural termination === The structural termination problem consists in deciding, given a channel system S if the termination problem holds for S for every initial configuration. This problem is undecidable even over counter machine. ==Communicating Hierarchical State Machine== Hierarchical state machines are finite state machines whose states themselves can be other machines. Since a communicating finite state machine is characterized by concurrency, the most notable trait in a communicating hierarchical state machine is the coexistence of hierarchy and concurrency. This had been considered highly suitable as it signifies stronger interaction inside the machine. However, it was proved that the coexistence of hierarchy and concurrency intrinsically costs language inclusion, language equivalence, and all of universality.Alur, Rajeev; Kannan, Sampath; Yannakakis, Mihalis. \\"Communicating hierarchical state machines,\\" Automata, Languages and Programming.

Women felt that the Hero's Journey did not fully encompass the journey that a female protagonist goes through in a story. The heroine's journey came about in 1990 when Maureen Murdock, a Jungian psychotherapist and a student of Joseph Campbell, published a self-help book called The Heroine's Journey: Woman's Quest for Wholeness in response to Campbell's Hero's Journey model. She developed the guide while working with her female patients. Murdock stated that the heroine's journey is the healing of the wounding of the feminine that exists deep within her and the culture. Murdock explains, \\"The feminine journey is about going down deep into soul, healing and reclaiming, while the masculine journey is up and out, to spirit.” Other authors such as Victoria Lynn Schmidt have created similar versions of the Heroine's Journey based on Murdock's. Schmidt's version changes some stages of Murdock's to help the model fit a bigger range of topics and experiences == Maureen Murdock's version of the heroine's journey == Murdock's model describes the female experience of a psycho-spiritual journey. Murdock proposed a cycle of eight stages. Like the Hero's Journey, these stages are able to be removed and switched around as necessary. It begins with the breaking away from feminine ideals and the turning towards the patriarchal values. Then comes the experience of spiritual death, and turning inward to reclaim the power and spirit of the sacred feminine. The ending stages consist of union of both the masculine and feminine values. === Shift from feminine to masculine === The heroine begins to distance herself from anything deemed feminine. Often it can be portrayed as a mother figure or a traditionally female role in society. The mother will be a representation of everything the heroine hates about her femininity. The mother may also be perfect, causing the heroine to reject her femininity out of feelings of inferiority. Winkle: \\"During stage one, the heroine rejects the feminine in favor of the masculine. She may still be tied to the feminine, but she increasingly resents that attachment.\\" === Identification with the masculine === The heroine begins to identify with external masculine values. This can be portrayed as a father figure or a traditionally male role in society. The father will be a representation of freedom from the mother figure. The father would praise the heroine for her strength, but also ridicule her for her femininity. The heroine will leave her feminine values behind completely and embrace the masculine values instead. Murdock: \\"This stage involves an Identification with the Masculine, but not one’s inner personal masculinity. Rather, it is the outer patriarchal masculine whose driving force is power. An individual in a patriarchal society is driven to seek control over themselves and others in an inhuman desire for perfection.\\" === Road of trials === Similar to the Hero's Journey, the heroine faces obstacles that lead to character development. These tasks will be related to gaining success, achieving higher status, and empowerment. Contrary to the Hero's Journey, the heroine also struggles with inner conflict. These tasks will be related to conquering preconceived notions of dependency, love, and inferiority. Winkle: \\"By stage three, the heroine has faced great trials and emerged victorious. She feels the thrill of success, and her confidence is bolstered by the applause of others. She has built an impressive, masculine reputation.\\" === Experiencing the illusory boon of success === The heroine will overcome the obstacles that she faced. Upon experiencing success, the heroine will realize she has betrayed her own values in order to achieve the goal. The heroine will feel limited in her new life. Murdock: \\"She has achieved everything she set out to do, but it has come at great sacrifice to her soul. Her relationship with her inner world is estranged. She feels oppressed but doesn’t understand the source of her victimization.\\" === The descent/meeting with the goddess === Crisis falls upon the heroine and the masculine traits she has learned fail. The crisis can be death in the family, mental or physical disabilities, or loss of self identity. Here the heroine must reconcile with her feminine side. The heroine meets with a goddess figure, who represents all the positive values of femininity she has left behind. After this meeting, she is inspired to return to femininity. === Yearning for the reconnect === The heroine wants to reconnect to her feminine side and may try to rekindle a bond between her and the mother. She may also try to go back to her previous style of living. However, the heroine will discover that she is not able to return to the old lifestyle she once lived. However, the heroine will see her old values and traits from a different perspective. === Reconciliation with the masculine === Another crisis falls upon the heroine and she must look inward and understand the masculine part of her identity. She will recognize that there are positives and negatives to her masculinity. Murdock: \\"The next stage involves Healing the Unrelated or Wounded Aspects of her Masculine Nature as the heroine takes back her negative projections on the men in her life. This involves identifying the parts of herself that have ignored her health and feelings, refused to accept her limits, told her to tough it out, and never let her rest. It also involves becoming aware of the positive aspects of her masculine nature that supports her desire to bring her images into fruition, helps her to speak her truth and own her authority.\\" === The union === In the final stage, the heroine fully accepts and understands both sides of her true nature. She will find balance between both sides and actively work towards keeping that balance. Murdock: \\"The heroine must become a spiritual warrior. This demands that she learn the delicate art of balance and have the patience for the slow, subtle integration of the feminine and masculine aspects of her nature.\\" == Victoria Lynn Schmidt's version of the heroine's journey == Victoria Lynn Schmidt wrote two versions of a character's journey: The Feminine and the Masculine Journey. She published her version in 2001 in her book: 45 Master Characters. The most noticeable differences were the circular nature and that the female had to prove herself to herself. Schmidt's version is commonly used in writing as opposed to Murdock's version. Similar to the Hero's Journey, the stages can be interchanged and repeatable. === Illusion of the perfect world === The heroine believes the world she lives in is perfect. She has deluded herself into thinking everything will turn out alright. The heroine may acknowledge that the world isn't ideal, but has some kind of coping mechanism to deal with this fact. These mechanisms may be naivety, denial, or subservience. === Betrayal/disillusionment === A crisis befalls the heroine in which her coping mechanisms fail her and the illusion of the perfect world is shattered. The crisis may be a personal betrayal, realization of the false world view, or her coping mechanisms become unhealthy. === The awakening === At first, the heroine may not want to accept her current state of being, but will decide to do something about her conflict. She will receive discouragement from others, but she knows she cannot remain in the illusion. The heroine will be searching for external means of help and guidance. The heroine may often bring tools from her perfect world to help her along her journey. === The descent: passing through the gates of judgement === The heroine will experience doubt towards her new lifestyle or identity. To move on, she must give up her tools and let go of the doubts holding her back. This stage can be moved around throughout the journey. \\"She may be ashamed of her new identity, guilty about sexual feelings or expression or have fears or shame associated with expressing herself, honoring intuition, or letting go of relationships that aren’t working for her.\\" === Eye of the storm === Similar to Boon of Success, the heroine triumphs for a short period of time. However, this victory serves as a false calm. This stage can be moved around throughout the journey. \\"In the true Heroine’s Journey, the heroine may experience momentary but not sustained success because those around her do not want to be led by a woman/women for long, or the men around her begin to undermine her, or after the crisis passes she is left trying to fill multiple roles that are inconsistent or impossible for a single person to fulfill.\\" === All is lost/death === The heroine realizes that her newly learned skills cannot help her and she cannot fall back on her old ways either. The situation around her gets worse and she has no choice but to accept defeat. === Support === The heroine finds support in a person who will help her out. This person can be anyone ranging from a spirit to a goddess to a friend. The heroine accepts the help of the supporter and comes to understand that \\"being alone is never enough.\\" This stage can be moved around throughout the journey. === Rebirth/moment of truth === Due to the support she has gotten, the heroine finds courage and hope again. She fully understands her place in the world and how she will face her doubts. \\"She “awakens” and sees the world and her role in it differently.\\" === Return to a new world === The heroine sees the world as it truly is. She understands herself better and this will change the way she lives her life from then on. This change is more spiritual and internally driven than external. == Reception == At the time of publication (1990), Murdock's book was a new concept for the world. It impacted both men and women and was published in seven different languages. However, Joseph Campbell had already rejected the model entirely. The Heroine's Journey was popular with women as many went to her lectures to learn more about the new topic. At one of her lectures, Murdock states, \\"At Mythic Journeys the feminine journey was being discussed in the basement in a room too small, while the masculine journey was discussed upstairs in the hotel’s Grand Ballroom!\\" Nowadays, the Heroine's Journey has become more popular as many different versions of the model have been made since Murdock's publication. == Criticisms == Murdock's book was written specifically for women and therapists, therefore it was hard to be used for writing. Murdock used her model to help her patients and has had many lectures to spread her teachings to others. Other versions such as Schmidt's allowed the Heroine's Journey to be more flexible and able to touch upon a number of different topics rather than just a spiritual journey. Joseph Campbell reportedly said when shown Murdock's model: \\"Women don’t need to make the journey, they are the place that everyone is trying to get to.\\" Campbell felt that there was no need to have a feminine version of the hero myth because they do not go on the journey. Women were the goal of the hero. It is worth noting that Campbell was examining myths with male heroes in them when he created the Hero's journey. == Heroine's journey in pop culture/literature == * Moana in Disney's Moana * Coraline Jones in Coraline * Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games * Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz * Rey in The Force Awakens/The Last Jedi == References == Category:Mythological archetypes ","title":"Heroine's journey"},{"id":"60388732","text":"Isabel Salomé Benedito de Palma, best known as Belita Palma (15 October 1932 — 1988),was an Angolan singer.

He began playing the accordion at age 7, but was soon introduced to the organ at the church where his mother did cleaning. In an interview Hegarty recounted that when his mother went to the church to clean in the evenings, \\"I wouldn't miss it. I'd go there with her so I could play the organ.\\" Hegarty taught himself how to play the organ, and by the time he reached high school he had a job as a church organist. He continued his study of music and the organ in college, receiving a B.A. in music from Loma Linda University in 1968, and going on to earn a master's degree in organ performance from Andrews University in 1970 where he studied organ with C. Warren Becker. In 1971 he assumed the position of organist for the Kettering Seventh-day Adventist Church in Kettering, Ohio, a position that he held until 1976.

(KK258, 1977) *Favorite Hymn Duets (KK321, 1985) *Sacred Organ Diversities (KK504, 1986) *Organ Duets for Four Hands (KK358, 1986) *Easy Festive Classics for Organ and Piano (KK353, 1986) *In Dulci Jubilo (Christmas Organ/Piano Duets) (KK421, 1987) *Christmas Duets for Organ and Piano, Vol. 4 (KK356, 1987) *Hymn Innovations for the Organist (KK450, 1991) *Hymns in Free Style (KK137, 1991) *Hymn Innovations for Organ and Piano (70/1009, 1993) In 1976 Hegarty resigned from his position at Lorenz (and his organist position at Kettering Seventh-day Adventist Church) to move to San Francisco, California. He continued publishing his original compositions with Lorenz and other publishers including Broadman Press and Hal Leonard Publications. As Hegarty settled into a California lifestyle, his compositional interests shifted from the sacred to the secular. He was appointed organist of the Castro Theatre in 1978, and began arranging both popular music and film music for his performances there. He became a frequent contributor to Sheet Music Magazine with arrangements for organ of such popular songs as The Way You Look Tonight, Who's Sorry Now, and In the Mood. He also published articles on organ performance technique. Hegarty Music Press publication of organ solos by John Gart In 1993 he founded Hegarty Music Press to develop and publish instructional material for organ performance, and to publish his original compositions. He also published works by the legendary radio/television organist John Gart, who Hegarty deeply admired. Notable publications from Hegarty Music Press include: *Method of Organ Playing (1993) *12 Service Pieces (1993) *Hymns for Bass Coupler (1993) *Six Rhythmic Organ Solos (by John Gart, 1994)) *Maestro Magic (1995) *Maestro Magic Live (1996) Hegarty's compositions have also appeared on stage and screen. In 2007 he was co-arranger, with his partner, Leonard Moors, of music for the New York Musical Theatre Festival production of Joel Adlen’s Emma. Hegarty has composed and performed the organ soundtracks for two films: *Hole to China (1999) *The Magic Man (2011) In 2017 Hegarty was commissioned to compose Appalachian Triptych, a piece that he dedicated to organist Jonathan Dimmock. This piece has been performed widely in Europe and the United States, and, in October 2018, broadcast on the Pipedreams program of American Public Media. ===Concert organist=== Hegarty at the console of the Castro Theatre Wurlitzer Organ When Hegarty came to San Francisco in 1976 he began performing at eclectic venues: a piano bar some nights, an East Bay pizza parlor on other nights, substituting at the Castro Theatre when he could, and of course church on Sundays. Some evenings between sets in a piano bar he would race to the Castro Theatre to play an intermission, then rush back to the piano bar for his next set. In a biopic Hegarty recalled the first time that he played at the Castro Theatre in 1976: After two years of playing at the Castro Theatre as a substitute, Hegarty joined the Castro Theatre as staff organist in 1978. In addition to his work at the Castro, Hegarty was named a staff organist at Palo Alto's Stanford Theatre in 1998, and in the same year became a regular recitalist at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor, presenting monthly pops concerts on the E.M. Skinner Organ. His concert tours have taken him all across America, and even around the coast of South America (as an organist for Prudential Lines South American Cruises). He has performed in many of the most prestigious concert venues in the United States including Kennedy Center, Davies Symphony Hall, the Crystal Cathedral, and Grace Cathedral. Hegarty is appreciated by audiences and critics alike. Paul Hume of The Washington Post described Hegarty as \\"one of the best.\\" ===Organ designer=== Hegarty with the Castro Symphonic Theatre Organ under construction at the R. A. Colby factory in Johnson City, Tennessee In 2015 the Wurlitzer organ, which had been on loan to the Castro Theatre since 1982, was removed. The owners of the organ were moving out of the Bay Area, and they needed to take the organ with them. The tradition of organ performance at the theatre dated back to the theatre's opening in 1922, and David Hegarty was not about to let that tradition die. Within a week Hegarty installed his personal digital organ in the theatre and performances continued, albeit on a much less capable organ than the \\"Mighty Wurlitzer.\\" During his concert tours throughout the United States, Hegarty was particularly impressed by the Harrah Symphonic Organ in Hurricane, West Virginia. The designer of that organ, Allen Harrah, was formerly president of the Rodgers Organ Company and inventor of the \\"hybrid\\" organ which uses a combination of wind-blown pipes (as in a traditional pipe organ) and digital pipe and orchestral voices to produce a much wider palette of sounds than would be found in a pipe organ alone. Hegarty conceived of an organ design for the Castro Theatre based on Harrah's work, and contacted Allen Harrah about the idea of designing such an organ. Harrah was excited about the project, and offered to produce a detailed design of the organ pro bono. Hegarty formed a non-profit organization to manage the building of the new \\"Castro Symphonic Theatre Organ,\\" and recruited Lauren Woodland and Harry Garland to serve on his Board of Directors. Hegarty serves as president of the board. Construction has begun on the new organ which, with seven manuals, will be the world’s largest hybrid organ. ===Archivist=== David Hegarty with Angela Morley at her home (2004) David Hegarty serves as conservator and archivist of the musical artifacts for the estate of John Gart and for the estate of Angela Morley. Hegarty furthers the legacy of John Gart by frequently including Gart's works in his concert programs, and through his publishing company, Hegarty Music Press, he has published previously unknown Gart compositions. Hegarty has also transcribed several of Angela Morley's compositions for organ, and regularly performs them in concert. In 2003 he was invited to perform his transcription of Morley's \\"Snow Ride\\" in a concert at Davies Symphony Hall with the San Francisco Symphony. In 2009 he was asked by The Film Music Society to write a remembrance of Angela Morley which was published in their quarterly journal, \\"The Cue Sheet.\\" == Recordings == Certificate of Honor presented to Hegarty Hegarty has released four CD's: *Phantastic! Symphonic Impressions for Two Organs and Virtual Orchestra (1998) *The Symphonic Organ Goes to Hollywood! (2006) *Inspirations (2006) *A Live Symphonic Organ Pops Concert (2012) Other organists who have recorded Hegarty's original compositions and arrangements include Kenrick S. Mervine (Sabbath Suite, White Christmas, Ave Maria: A Symphonic Suite for Organ) and Steven Frank (Aria Pathétique.) == Recognition == In 2012 the San Francisco Arts Commission engaged artist Paul Madonna to produce a series of six posters honoring a \\"broad array of arts and artists in San Francisco’s history.\\" The posters were put on prominent display along Market Street in San Francisco. One of those six posters was dedicated to honoring Hegarty. Each year the San Francisco Film Society honors the \\"Bay Area film community’s most vital figures and institutions.\\" In 2013 Hegarty was so recognized \\"for the indelible mark he has made on the Bay Area’s vital and progressive filmmaking culture.\\" In 2018 Hegarty received a Certificate of Honor from the Mayor of San Francisco recognizing him for his work in “creating the world’s most impressive and versatile hybrid symphonic organ,” and congratulating Hegarty on his 40th year as organist for the Castro Theatre. == References * *, performed by Harry Garland on the Castro Theatre Wurlitzer. * Category:1945 births Category:20th- century composers Category:21st-century composers Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:21st-century American male musicians Category:21st-century organists Category:20th-century organists Category:American classical organists Category:American male organists Category:Living people Category:American keyboardists Category:Theatre organists Category:Loma Linda University alumni Category:Andrews University alumni ","title":"David Hegarty"},{"id":"60388807","text":"Worldcon 1976 This I Believe: Our Noble, Essential Decency is an essay written and recorded by Robert Anson Heinlein in 1952, as part of the Edward R.

She was known for creating the role of Conchita Perez in a stage adaptation of La Femme et le Pantin (1910), in which her very minimal costume was a matter of some scandal.

Her father, Desmond James Cecil Roberts, was a general practitioner. She moved to London when she was eighteen years old and began working for a recruitment company, eventually serving as an associate director. She met Lord Gerald Fitzalan-Howard, the youngest son of Miles Fitzalan-Howard, 17th Duke of Norfolk and Anne Constable-Maxwell, at a wedding in 1988. Roberts married Lord Gerald in December 1990. She and her husband have three children. Through her marriage she is a sister-in-law of the 18th Duke of Norfolk, Edward Fitzalan-Howard. As the wife of a younger son of a British duke, Roberts is styled in the feminine form of her husband's title, as Lady Gerald, and not with her own name, which is reserved for the daughters of high-ranking peers. In 1991, Lady Gerald and her husband moved from London to Carlton Towers, a country house in Carlton owned by the Howard family. She runs the estate alongside her husband.

She remodeled the family's private apartments inside of Carlton Towers, and works as the furniture buyer and interior designer for reconstructive projects. In March 2014 she opened a cookery school at Carlton. As lady of the manor, Lady Gerald hosts guests at Carlton Towers for teas, dinners, and other events. Lady Gerald was a regular cast member of the Sky Atlantic documentary reality television series Weekend Aristocrats, which featured working class and middle-class people staying at private country homes and engaging with members of the British nobility and gentry. The series was later screened on Netflix. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Howard family (English aristocracy) Category:Nobility of the United Kingdom Category:Participants in British reality television series Category:People from Mayfield, East Sussex Category:Television personalities from Sussex Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Lady Gerald Fitzalan-Howard"},{"id":"60389233","text":"Eike-Henner Kluge is the first expert witness in medical ethics recognized by Canadian courts. Dr. Kluge, has acted as an expert witness in Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario. He is known for his work on contentious medical ethics issue such as abortion and the ethics of deliberate death in addition to privacy and medical informatics. He established and was the first director of the Canadian Medical Association Department of Ethics and Legal Affairs. Dr. Kluge, is the author of the International Medical Informatics Association's code of ethics and their ethics handbook. Additionally, he is a fellow in the Royal Society of Canada. == Abortion == While the director of the Canadian Medical Association ethics and legal affairs, in 1991 drafted an analysis for a Senate committee about Bill C-43, which would sentence doctors to two years in jail for performing abortions where a woman's health is not at risk. Kluge viewed that the bill was flawed ethically. His presentation may have swayed two votes to change resulting in an unprecedented tied vote in January 1991 which resulted in the Senate not passing the Bill C-43. == Deliberate Death == He was an expert witness in Rodriguez v British Columbia (AG) which was the first case to challenge section 241(b) of the Criminal Code and Carter v Canada (AG). Dr Kluge acted as ethics advisor to Sue Rodriguez. He argues that, \\"there is no right to die—but there is a right to shape and end our lives in keeping with our competently-held values...It is all a matter of autonomy, beneficence and non-malfeasance.\\" Eike-Henner was also an expert witness in Carter v Canada (AG). == Law School Admission Council Investigation == Dr Kluge's complaint to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada lead to the Law School Admission Council's no longer being able to fingerprint LSAT test takers in Canada. == Publications == === Books === * * William of Ockham's Commentary on Porphyry's Book of the Predicables, (serialised in Franciscan Studies, 1973-74). * The Practice of Death (1975) * The Metaphysics of Gottlob Frege: An Essay in Ontological Reconstruction (1980) * The Ethics of Deliberate Death (1981) * New human reproductive technologies : a preliminary perspective of the Canadian Medical Association (1991) * Readings in Biomedical Ethics: A Canadian Focus {1993; 1999; 2004) * The Ethics of Electronic Patient Records (2001) * A Handbook of Ethics for Health Informatics Professionals 2003) * Ethics in Health Care: A Canadian Focus (2013) * Ethics for Health Informatics Professionals: The IMIA Code,its Meaning and Implications (2016) * The Electronic Health Record: Ethical Considerations (2020) === Co-author books === * Withholding Treatment from Defective Newborn Children (1985) * Home telehealth for chronic disease management (2008) === Documentaries === * Shadow Company (2006) - As Self - Professor of Ethics === Selected academic works === * *Kluge, Eike-Henner W.

From 2016 to 2019, she served as Board Chair of RBM Partnership To End Malaria. Before joining WHO in 1999, Mpanju-Shumbusho was Director General of The East, Central and Southern African Health Community (ECSA-HC) formerly known as the Commonwealth Regional Health Community for East, Central and Southern Africa (CRHC-ECSA). Mpanju-Shumbusho is a co-founder, board member, and volunteer for the not-for- profit organization Adventures in Health, Education, and Agricultural Development (AHEAD Inc), which was founded in 1981 to provide hands-on, people-to-people assistance to underserved communities in Africa and inner- city United States. She was also co-founder of the Medical Women Association of Tanzania and served as Treasurer and Executive Committee member of the Medical Association of Tanzania. In 2019, she was awarded the Multisector Partnership Honour by Malaria No More as one of the top Women Leading the Fight Against Malaria. Mpanju-Shumbusho is married with two adult children. == Early life and education == Winifrida Kokwenda Mpanju was born in Maruku village, Kagera Region in northwest Tanzania on the shores of Lake Victoria, the eldest child of Omulangira Benedicto Timbilimu Mpanju (Late) and Omumbeija Paskazia Koburungo Mpanju. In part because of the health disparities she witnessed as a child, Mpanju-Shumbusho decided from a young age that medicine would be her calling. She went on to study medicine at Muhimbili Faculty of Medicine, University of Dar es Salaam, predecessor to Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS), where she graduated with a Doctor of Medicine degree in 1979. From 1980-1981 she was the medical officer in-charge of historical Ocean Road Hospital (now Ocean Road Cancer Institute) in Dar-es- salaam, the hospital first inaugurated in 1897 and historically famed as the site of Robert Koch’s seminal research in tropical diseases. As a recognition of Mpanju-Shumbusho's leadership qualities, in 1981 she was awarded the Hubert H. Humphrey North-South Fellowship for graduate study at Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. She graduated with a Master of Public Health degree from Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in 1982. Mpanju-Shumbusho obtained a Master of Medicine in Paediatrics and Child Health degree from the University of Dar-es-salaam’s Muhimbili Faculty of Medicine in 1986. == Career == === Pediatrics and Community Health === Mpanju-Shumbusho's teaching and research career began in 1986 at her alma mater, Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, following her appointment to the university’s faculty as a Senior Medical Officer and Senior Lecturer in Paediatrics, Child Health, and Community Health. During this time she was also a Consultant Paediatrician in the Department of Paediatrics and Child Health at Muhimbili National Hospital, Tanzania's largest referral and teaching hospital. Subsequently, she was appointed Head of the Department of Community Health, MUHAS, and Chief Public Health Adviser to the Tanzania Ministry of Health from 1986-1993. In this capacity, Mpanju-Shumbusho guided the strengthening of the medical school's training curriculum to include more community oriented and community based training, the model later emulated by other institutions in Eastern Africa, including Moi University, Kenya, and the University of Malawi College of Medicine in Malawi. She also spearheaded collaborations between MUHAS and various universities and national and international medical research institutions (e.g. Karolinska Insititute in Sweden). As the chief public health technical advisor to the Tanzania Ministry of Health, Mpanju-Shumbusho was a member of national public health steering committees and think tanks for establishment and review of Tanzania's national public health and primary health care programmes, including maternal and child health (MCH), expanded immunisation, major communicable diseases, and water and sanitation. Mpanju- Shumbusho’s contribution to the global effort for eradication of malaria started many decades ago. In the mid-1990s she was an international clinical monitor of the open randomized trial of artemether against quinine in the treatment of cerebral malaria in African children, which was conducted in Tanzania, Malawi, and Nigeria. Results from the study contributed significantly towards the WHO policy change to Artemisinin Combination Therapy as first-line treatment for malaria in endemic countries. In another study, Mpanju-Shumbusho served as the international clinical medical monitor for the SPF66 malaria vaccine trial conducted in Ifakara District and Ifakara Health Institute, Tanzania, from 1990-1995 under the sponsorship of WHO and the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) and in collaboration with Prof. Peter Smith of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and Dr Malcom Molyneux of Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. === Director General East, Central, and Southern African Health community (1997-1999) === Mpanju-Shumbusho joined ECSA-HC (formerly CRHC-ECSA) in 1993 as Director of the Reproductive Health and Research Programme. The intergovernmental organization, headquartered in Arusha, Tanzania, was established in 1974 to foster and promote regional cooperation in health among Member States of Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. In 1997, Mpanju-Shumbusho was appointed Director-General/Regional Secretary of ECSA-HC. As the organization's Director General and Head of Mission, she led the development and implementation of the first-ever ECSA-HC Five-Year Strategic Plan (1999-2004), which raised the international profile of ECSA-HC. She also initiated collaborations with various regional, international, and donor agencies, and mobilized resources from member states and donors, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), European Commission, Rockefeller Foundation, Wellstart International, WHO, and others. === World Health Organization === Mpanju-Shumbusho had many leadership roles within WHO since joining the UN Agency in 1999 as Director of the HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections Initiative, later renamed HIV/AIDS Department, the position she held until 2003. In this role she led the mainstreaming of HIV into the work of all relevant WHO Clusters and Departments, mobilization of WHO on HIV, and ensured integration of HIV into the various areas of work of the WHO, increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS within the WHO and advocacy to make the disease a priority. She directed the development of the first ever Global Health Sector Strategy for HIV/AIDS for the period 2003-2007 and development of the first ever WHO Guidelines for public health approach to scaling up antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource limited settings. She was co-founder of the WHO 3by5 Initiative and directed the Organization's 3by5 country support activities for scaling up AIDS treatment globally. Subsequently, Mpanju-Shumbusho was appointed Senior Adviser to the Assistant Director General during which she concomitantly served as Director of the Office of WHO/Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund) Partnership and Technical Cooperation, overseeing WHO’s work with global health partnerships. In addition to the Global Fund, other partners included UNAIDS, Stop TB Partnership, RBM Partnership, UNITAID, and TDR. The initiative entailed cross-cutting coordination with other WHO Clusters, including Health Systems Strengthening, Family and Community Health, the six WHO Regional Offices, and key donors and NGOs. From 2005-2015, Mpanju-Shumbusho was a Board Member of the Global Fund. Mpanju-Shumbusho was appointed an Assistant Director General of WHO for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Malaria and Neglected Tropical Diseases. As WHO Assistant Director General , Mpanju-Shumbusho steered WHO’s work in prevention, control, impact-mitigation, country support and global partnerships to combat the diseases under her purview and contributed significantly to the attainment of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) #6 and related MDGs. Her leadership ensured smooth and pragmatic transition between the MDG and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) frameworks. Her leadership of the WHO-Global Fund collaboration facilitated eligible countries’ acquisition of more than USD 10 Billion from the Global Fund for combating diseases and strengthening health systems. Mpanju-Shumbusho retired from WHO on December 31, 2015. === Roll Back Malaria === Mpanju-Shumbusho joined the RBM Partnership To End Malaria Board in 2016 as board chair. She has dedicated her recent career to the journey for malaria elimination and universal health coverage. As Board Chair, she reinvigorated the Partnership and ensured it was on the forefront of global efforts to mobilise the necessary political will and resources to renew the fight to end malaria for good. She provided leadership that ensured vigour, cautioning that the partnerships, strategies, and tools that eliminated malaria in 27 countries, and that reduced malaria by more than half, saving nearly 7 million lives since 2000, are nevertheless not enough to end malaria for good, especially in the highest burden countries where the disease still thrives. Mpanju-Shumbusho continues to chair meetings for WHO and other international organizations focused on malaria eradication. She is the co-chair of the Lancet Commission on Malaria Eradication and has authored numerous publications advocating for initiatives to end new malarial infections. After completing her three-year term in 2019, Mpanju-Shumbusho passed the role onto her successor, Prof. Maha Taysir Barakat, former director-general of Health Authority Abu Dhabi. === Global Commission on Malaria Eradication === Mpanju-Shumbusho was co-senior author, alongside Prof. Richard Feachem, on the report from The Lancet in 2019 about malaria eradication within 30 years. == References == Category:Tanzanian women scientists Category:Women pediatricians Category:World Health Organization officials Category:Tanzanian medical doctors Category:Pediatricians Category:Living people Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Winnie Mpanju-Shumbusho"},{"id":"60389263","text":"Giacomo Battaglia Giacomo Battaglia (27 January 1965 – 1 April 2019) and Luigi Miseferi (born 30 April 1966) were an Italian comedy duo. == Biography == Having met casually in Reggio Calabria thanks to a group of friends, they began their artistic partnership in the mid-1980s with a series of successful radio broadcasts on local broadcasters.

She develops materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Nazar demonstrated that interwoven composites could be used to improve the energy density of lithium–sulphur batteries. She was awarded the 2019 Chemical Institute of Canada Medal. == Early life and education == Nazar studied chemistry at the University of British Columbia, where she earned a bachelor's degree in 1978. She was inspired to study chemistry after being inspired by her first year professor. Her father had trained as a scientist and ran his own jewellery making business. Nazar joined the University of Toronto for her graduate studies, and completed a PhD under the supervision of Geoffrey Ozin in 1984. She was a postdoctoral researcher at Exxon Research and Engineering Company. She joined the University of Waterloo in the late 1980s, when she became interested in electrochemistry and Inorganic chemistry. == Research and career == Nazar works in materials chemistry at the University of Waterloo, where she designs energy storage devices and electrochemical systems. Her research group create new materials and nanostructures for lithium–sulfur batteries, including interwoven composites. She develops structural probes to understand how the morphology of materials that are capable of charge/ ionic redox processes impact their functions. These techniques include nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electrochemistry, AC Impedance Spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction measurements. Nazar was a founding member of the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology. Nazar is recognised as being a \\"leading authority in advanced materials\\". She was awarded a Canada Research Chair in 2004, which was renewed in 2008 and 2012. In 2009 Nazar joined the California Institute of Technology as a More Distinguished Scholar. In 2013 she was awarded a $1.8 million fellowship from the National Research Council to investigate energy storage materials for automotive applications. Nazar is particularly interested in storage materials that go beyond lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, zinc ion batteries and magnesium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries are the battery of choice in hybrid electric vehicles, but concerns have arisen about the global supply of lithium. Her early work developed porous carbon architectures as frameworks for cathodes, enhancing their conductivity and discharge capacity. She demonstrated that interwoven carbon composites could be used to improve the energy density of lithium–sulphur batteries. She showed it was possible to create mesoporous carbon frameworks that constrain the grown of sulphur nanofillers, which improved energy storage and reversibility. Nazar calculated the low-cost lithium–sulphur batteries could take electric cars twice as far as current lithium-ion technologies. Sulphur is an abundant material that can be used to replace cobalt oxide in lithium-ion batteries. Unfortunately, sulphur can dissolve into the electrolyte solution, and be reduced by electrons to form polysulphides. They are also susceptible to high internal resistance and capacity fading on cycling. These challenges can be overcome by creating nanostructures in the electrodes. Interwoven composites can also be made from manganese dioxide, which stabilise polysuplphides in lithium–sulphur batteries. Manganese dioxide reduces sulphides via a surface-bound polythiosulphanates, and can withstand 2,000 discharge cycles without the loss of capacitance. She has also developed lithium oxygen batteries, which are lightweight with high energy density. In lithium oxygen batteries, superoxide and peroxide can act to degrade the cells; limiting their lifetime. If the electrolyte is replace with a molten salt and the porous cathode with a bifunctional metal oxide, the peroxide does not form. Nazar has worked on supercapacitors and polyanion materials. She was made a Professor at the University of Waterloo in 2016 and holds a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Solid State Energy Materials. Since 2014 Nazar has served on the Board of Directors of the International Meeting on Li-Batteries. She serves on the editorial boards of the journals Angewandte Chemie, Energy & Environmental Science and the Journal of Materials Chemistry A. === Awards and honours === Her awards and honours include; * 1978 Royal Society of Chemistry Undergraduate Award * 2010 Canadian Society for Chemistry Rio Tinto Alcan Award for Electrochemistry * 2011 International Battery Association Award * 2011 Royal Society of Canada Fellowship * 2012 International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry Distinguished Women in Chemistry * 2013 Society of German Chemists August-Wilhelm-von-Hofmann Lectureship * 2014 Web of Science Most Highly Cited Researchers * 2014 Thomson Reuters World’s Most Influential Scientific Minds * 2015 Officer of the Order of Canada * 2017 University of Waterloo Outstanding Performance Award * 2018 Thomson Reuters Most Highly Cited Researchers * 2019 Chemical Institute of Canada Medal *2020 Elected Fellow of the Royal Society === Patents === Nazar's patents include; * 2002 New electrode materials for a rechargeable electrochemical cell * 2007 Mixed Lithium/Sodium Ion Iron Fluorophosphate Cathodes for Lithium Ion Batteries * 2009 Sulfur-carbon material * 2011 Multicomponent electrodes for rechargeable batteries * 2014 Composites comprising mxenes for cathodes of lithium sulphur cells * 2015 Electrode materials for rechargeable zinc cells and batteries produced therefrom == References == Category:Canadian women academics Category:Canadian women chemists Category:University of British Columbia alumni Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:University of Waterloo faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Officers of the Order of Canada Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Canada Category:Canada Research Chairs ","title":"Linda Nazar"},{"id":"60389302","text":"Roberto Barni (born 1939) is an Italian sculptor. ==Biography== Roberto Barni was born in Pistoia.

As the tournament was played in a single round-robin system, Argentina and Brazil finished tied on points at the end of the tournament. Therefore, a playoff match had to be played to crown a champion, according to the rules. The match was held in San Lorenzo stadium, were both teams played hard, committing several number of fouls. After Brazilian player Domingos Spitalletti kicked Francisco Varallo violently in the 36th minute, a riot involving all the players (even some substitutes) started. After a hiatus of 40', the match restarted. Nevertheless, just two minutes a new riot happened after Cunha hit Cherro on his face. For the second half Carlos Peucelle replaced Cherro and veteran Bernabé Ferreyra substituted Zozaya. A young Vicente de la Mata replaced Varallo, who had been injured. De la Mata had played in the loss to Uruguay, with a poor performance. Argentina and Brazil tied 0–0 at the end of the regulation time, playing additional time (two halves of 20' each) to crown a champion.

It is situated in Yoho National Park, with its nearest higher peak being Mount Balfour, to the northeast, and Fairy Lake directly below its southern slope. ==History== The mountain was named by Jean Habel in 1897 for its resemblance to a mountain in Norway. The translation is Witch's Peak. Chambers' Encyclopædia: A Dictionary of Universal Knowledge, page 796 Jean Habel was a German geographer who explored the Yoho Valley in 1896. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1901 by James Outram and Edward Whymper, with guides Christian Kaufmann, Christian Klucker, and Joseph Pollinger. Outram described the climb in his book, \\"In the Heart of the Canadian Rockies\\" as follows: \\"On the 21st we had a little climb to a ruined tower on a serrated spur of Mt. Balfour, which had been called by Mr. Habel \\"Trolltinder,\\" or the Witch's Peaks, after a famous and much pinnacled ridge above the Romsdal in Norway: the legend saying that the points represent a wedding party turned to stone by an evil genius. It was an absurdly simple climb, though somewhat laborious, except for the last fifty feet, which gave us a really good gymnastic scramble.\\" In the Heart of the Canadian Rockies, James Outram, Rocky Mountain Books, 2007 The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. ==Geology== Trolltinder Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the Köppen climate classification, Trolltinder Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.

She gained recognition through her work in filmmaking in the mid to late 1990s. Her main focus has been \\"to make forceful commentaries on power relationships, sexism, and violence against women\\". == Biography == Teresa Serrano was born in Mexico City in 1936. Serrano married at age nineteen and eventually had six children. After her children had grown up, Serrano divorced her husband in 1982 and moved to New York to begin a career in art. Her husband had previously prevented her from going into the art world. These particular limitations in Serrano's life had been a contributing influence in the creation of her art. In New York City, Serrano connected with poets like David Shapiro and Raphael Rubinstein. Serrano often collaborated with close friends who were artists, but it was not until 1997 that Serrano began experimenting with other types of media to widen discourse about female roles within society. Her first video was in regards to migration and memory. She then ventured off to a television style of producing art which stemmed from her love of films. Using familiar media, such as soap operas, helped Serrano connect with audiences more clearly. It also led her to work with several female actresses and directors. She recalls her inspiration in various female filmmakers such as Sophie Calle and Chantel Akerman. When it came to sculptures she used multiple materials like \\"iron, steel, fabric, ceramic, and fiberglass.\\" == Themes == Most of Serrano's work derives from the issue of female inequality and treatment in society. When she had created La piñata, she went to the area that had influenced her video and took photos of the town where the women had been murdered. She wanted to make a connection between the viewer and the subjects of those photographs. It was meant to compel viewers to understand the bigger issue about femicide and how there wasn't any justice for it. == Notable Work == Serrano is mostly known for her exhibition titled Albur de Amor. In this work, she captures all her photography and video art and puts them together. It explores the different themes she has worked with like sexual harassment, women's place in the workforce, and the feeling of being trapped as a woman in a male-dominated society. == Education == In addition to being a self-taught artist, Serrano has studied with Mexican artists Carlos Orozco Romero and Javier Arevalo. == Personal Life == Serrano has stated that she is not religious. She resides and works in both Mexico and New York City. == Artwork == La piñata (2003) Included in Serrano's \\"Rituals\\" video piece, La piñata showcases a man taunting and hitting a pinata shaped like a woman. Serrano had created this in response to the 2001 rape attacks and murders of women near Ciudad Juarez. A piñata shaped like a woman dangles from the ceiling as a man physically harasses it with a stick. Serrano was one of the first artists to use her craft to highlight and address femicide and gender violence. Restraint (2006) With video as a medium, Serrano herself portrays a woman who tries to soften the voice of a hotel bell. Her finger is stuck on the bell as she frantically attempts to write. Annoyed, the woman attempts to use earplugs and headphones to cancel the noise, to no avail. She eventually puts a black hood over herself, and this calms her. The piece is symbolic of the suppression of women in society and speaks to the limitations placed on women to limit development and fulfillment. Glass Ceiling (2008) Short film exhibited by Art for the World. A woman is seen going up some stairs, but is stopped by a man. The piece discusses the sexism and patriarchy that women may face in the workplace as they attempt to advance in a career. == Exhibitions == === Solo exhibitions=== * 1989 Ofrendas.

She is an indigenous Chicana currently based in Cupertino, California. As an artist she works with textiles in attempt to unify her American roots with her Mexican Indigenous ones, along with trying to convey the same for other multicultural people. == Biography == Consuelo Jimenez Underwood was born in Sacramento, California, the eleventh child born to a Chicana (Mexican- American) mother and father of Huichol Indian descent. Her family, herself included, were all migrant field workers in California, and due to her father's legal status, when said fields were raided by what was then known as the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), he would get deported. The family had homes in both Calexico, California and Mexicali, Mexico, and they would cross the border between the two multiple times per day. Jiménez Underwood initially studied painting in college but felt connected to fiber work through her Huichol Indian heritage and switched concentrations. Before solely pursuing art, she was an Adjunct Professor at the California College of the Arts in Berkeley (2007), Assistant Professor (1989-1996), Associate Professor (1996-2001), and Professor of Art at San Jose State University (2001-2009). Jimenez Underwood was introduced to the uses of textile at a young age, she would watch her mother crochet and embroider. She has stated that making art through the use of textile allows her to have some recognition of her mother as well as of her culture, her father's indigenous roots. During her college education she decided to learn these traditions using textile to keep them alive and embrace like her indigenous ancestors did.Meza-DesPlas, Rosemary. \\"La Costura, Sew What?.\\" NAAAS Conference Proceedings. National Association of African American Studies, 2014. == Education == Jiménez Underwood was the first person in her family to complete high school, before going on to earn a Bachelor's degree (BA) in 1981 in art from San Diego State University, where she also studied for her Master's degree (MA) in 1985. She then went on to obtain a Master's degree in fine arts (MFA) at San Jose State University in 1987. She went on to spend twenty years as an educator and Head of Fiber/Textile Area at the School of Art and Design at San Jose State University, first as Associate Professor and from 1989 to 2001, then as Professor from 2001 to 2009. == Artwork == warning sign for immigrants potentially entering and crossing the freeway. Designed by Caltrans graphic artist John Hood in the late 1980s and erected along San Diego freeways starting in September 1990. Jiménez Underwood's artwork focuses on the Mexican-American border and the political complexities surrounding it. Her pieces are informed by her memories of growing up on the border and having to smuggle her undocumented father back into the United States. Her mixed media pieces combine traditional materials like thread and silk with barbed wire and safety pins. Jiménez Underwood's imagery includes flowers, \\"Immigrants Crossing\\" road signs, tortillas, and Our Lady of Guadalupe. === Borderlines === A series of multi media art installations within 2010-2017, Jimenez Underwood's Borderlines pieces involve paint, yarn, beads, barbed wire and more. Her use of barbed wire being an immediate tie to the border and the suffering it brings to the immigrants that cross it. These pieces are a depiction of the Mexico - U.S. border that she states she created in hopes of bringing awareness to the many dangerous effects that the border has and will continue to have as time goes on. The effects it'll have on the coming generations, the environment, the alienation it instills in humanity. === Flags === Another series, dated 1993 and 2013, her Flags are made of fiber, fabric, threads, leather, plastic, pins, and beads that create the merging of the Mexico and United States flags. Bright colors from the blue of the American flag to the green of the Mexican flag, the stars, and the eagle all make the use of both flags stand out and contrast one another. Combining the flags, through pieces or what appears to be a silhouette of both in \\"One Nation Underground\\" is with the intent of expressing her multiculturalism and that of others, embracing both cultures and inevitably combining them and all that comes with each individual country.Wessel, Brooke. \\"Challenging Creative Authority: Consuelo Jimenez Underwood’s Battle With Cultural Identity.\\" (2016). === Virgen de los Caminos === Made in 1994 of cotton, silk, and metallic thread, Virgen De los Caminos (Virgin of the Roads) is now hung at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. This piece is a children's quilt with embroidered flowers, barbed wire, la Virgen De Guadalupe (a religious Mexican symbol), and almost invisible appearances of the word \\"Caution\\" accompanied by the silhouettes by John Hood that are also seen in C. Jane Run. Authors Jonathan Yorba and Cristina Serna suggest that the Virgin of Guadalupe is a guardian saint for the immigrants crossing into the United States from Mexico, with the images from Hood's road signs being embroidered in white onto the light colored fabric to express that immigrant families are ghosts, nearly invisible and somehow unnoticed by others. == Selected exhibitions == === Solo exhibitions === * Cultural Contradictions, Bade Museum, Berkeley, CA 1991 * California Artists: Consuelo Jimenez Underwood, Triton Museum, Santa Clara, CA 1992 * Tortilla Meets Tortilla Wall, InSite_05, Border State Park, Performance at United States/Mexico Border 2005 * California State University, Dominguez Hills Art Gallery, Dominguez Hills, CA 2014 * Mothers: The Act of Seeing, Nevada Museum of Art, Reno, NV 2015 * ArtRage Gallery], Syracuse, NY 2015ArtRage Gallery * George Washington University Museum and Textile Museum (Washington, D.C.), Washington, D.C., 2016George Washington University Museum === Group exhibitions === * California Art Show, California State Fair, Sacramento, CA 1981 *1984 California Works, California State Fair, Sacramento, CA 1984 *Area Chicano Artists, Gavilan College, Gilroy, CA 1987 *Emerging Artists From San Jose, San Jose Museum of Art, San Jose, CA 1988 *Three Traditions, Southwestern College Gallery, Chula Vista, CA 1989 *Convergence- Connecting Threads, San Jose Convention Center, San Jose, CA 1990 *Connections in Chicano and Latino Art, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco, CA 1991 *La Fe: Spiritual And Religious Expressions in Chicano Art, Galeria de la Raza/Studio 24, San Francisco, CA 1993 *Rethinking La Malinche, Mexic-Arte Museum, Austin, TX 1994 *Transformations!, UNAM Gallery, San Antonio, TX 1994 *Choices!

Trones, having bought out Parker's interested in the store, operated it himself for several years before selling it to the Tellvik family in 1927. Mr. Tellvik added the garage which operated in conjunction with a Shell Oil Company gas pump. The store passed to several families in the 1930s: from the Tellviks to the Townes to the Sextons. In 1938, Mr. and Mrs. Guy Kress bought and renamed the store \\"Kress Store\\", operating it until 1943 when war rationing and declining business led the Kresses to close the store. After falling into disrepair, the building was rehabilitated as a residence and studio in 1985, restoring the facade to its original appearance.

Deacon was born in Nikolayev, then in south Russia, where his English father worked for a shipping firm, and at the age of thirteen was sent back to finish his education in England. Deacon graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, and was awarded a grant for anthropological fieldwork in Malakula. He arrived there in January 1926 and died there on 12 March 1927 of blackwater fever. Deacon's fieldwork was edited by Camilla Wedgwood into an ethnography in 1934. Wedgwood incorporated the notes of the earlier field-worker John Layard into the book without Layard's knowledge and following threats of legal action the first edition only appeared with Layard's comments. The book was drawn on by both later ethnographers and present-day inhabitants of the islands, although later fieldwork by Margaret Patterson radically reinterpreted his evidence on the Ambrym marriage system. Deacon had known Margaret Gardiner, a fellow student, for more than a year before leaving Cambridge, but they only started a relationship on the evening before his departure from Cambridge. Although they exchanged many letters, and arranged to meet in Australia to live as a couple, they never met again. Gardiner's memoir of Deacon was published in 1984. == Works == * A. B.

The first service held there was conducted on 4 July 1841 by Rev. C. B. Howard, then took alternate Sundays with James Farrell. :It has been called the third Anglican church in the colony, the first being Trinity Church in 1836. St John's church on Halifax Street, the contender for second place, however, did not hold its first service until 24 October 1841. The church was built by voluntary labour, of stringybark (possibly Eucalyptus obliqua or Eucalyptus baxteri) timber, on land donated by John Wickham Daw (c. 1797–1872), and all materials and furnishings were paid for by voluntary contributions. The name was chosen by Daw in recognition of his home parish St Mary Abbots of Kensington. England. This structure was always intended to be temporary, and the foundation stone for a new building was laid at the present site, some 200 metres south of the original, on 27 October 1846 by Miss Fanny Conway. The new building, designed by Moses Garlick (c. 1784–1859), father of architect Daniel Garlick, and built of stone donated by the Ayliffe family, was completed and on 12 September 1847 the first service was conducted by Rev. James Farrell and Rev. W. J. Woodcock. The church was consecrated by Bishop Short on 11 March 1849. That same year transepts, chancel, bell tower (later raised to a height of ), vestry and porch were added. A vicarage was completed around the same time. :St James's church, Blakiston, which was never substantially modified, was opened on 26 April 1847 and consecrated in 1848. The old building served as a schoolroom for many years and was demolished in 1928. The village of St Mary's on the Sturt, which became the Adelaide suburb of St Marys was named after the church.

Growing up, she was raised in a Catholic home with four sisters and a strong family foundation. Dávila's mother was a caring woman who supported her through life. Her father's dedication to music and learning aspired and shaped Dávila's career as an artist.. Much of her interest in art comes from growing up as the daughter of a musician. Her artwork includes collagraphs, serigraphs, and prints. Her art reflects from her Puerto Rican culture using many influences and memories. Dávila is currently a professor at Memphis College of Art in Tennessee, where she has taught printmaking since 1982. == Education == Dávila studied art education at University of Puerto Rico in 1970. She graduated the university with a Bachelor's Degree in art education in 1974 and continued to study art in New York. She attended Pratt Institute in New York City and graduated with a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1977. Dávila also trained under Clare Romano, a printmaker and painter, as an intern for printmaking. == Artwork == ===The Three Wise Men=== In 1993, Dávila created a mixed media sculpture about the birth of Christ. Using an abstract approach, she creates this three dimensional that allows one to view her artwork from different angles. In her sculpture, one can see the three wise men dressed in colorful attire through rectangular openings. Because this vertical box has slits and openings around it, the openings expose the men; however, her work of abstract appears when one can't fully view the entire artwork from the openings. Dávila's unique way of positioning the figures create a sacred theme. The rectangular sculpture is created with gold plated cardboard while the figures are created with colorful paper. This religious mixed media sculpture is something that now plays a huge role in American art. ===Catedral de Río=== Created in 1993, Dávila's book serigraph displays geometric abstract with many different colors and mosaic designs. The structure of a catedral with many vertical columns is displayed creating a three dimensional figure. The overlapping of pages creates many different serigraphs in one giving a different experience to the viewer from a slightly different angle. The movement of pages takes the viewer on a journey when exposed to a new view. === Paisaje en Transición === Also known as Landscape in Transition(1994), this artwork is a collagraph that incorporates many styles of the early Renaissance. Dávila combines three different themes into one piece creating a large landscape that symbolize many things. When this artwork is viewed in a religious eye, it is seen as three different levels of the sky, earth, and what is below the earth, transitioning into each other. Thus, symbolizing Heaven above, Purgatory on Earth, and Hell Below. The many different colors of this piece ranges from cool tones to warm colors. The blue and violet colors create a somber mood while the warmer colors create an enriching mood. == Exhibitions == === Solo exhibitions === *2009- Ancestry, Culture, and Other Influences, Arkansas State University *2010- Schematics, University of Arkansas *2013- Ancestry and Identity: Prints by Maritza Dávila, Memphis Brooks Museum of Art in Tennessee === Group exhibitions === *1987-Latina Art: Showcase 1987, National Museum of Mexican Art, Chicago, Illinois *2015- Mi Sur/ My South, Memphis *2015-2016- We Are You Project, Kean University Human Rights Institute *2016- Le Monster Project, Memphis College of Art *2018- Print Making and the Political Present, University of Memphis *2018- RiverArtsFest Invitational ArtShow, Memphis *2018- North American Print Exhibition, Hawaii *2018- La litografia en otros con-textos, Argentina == Collections == Dávila has her work and collections in many parts of the world such as the US, Europe, and Asia.

Rivera focuses on uncovering subjects related with human's dismissal for nature with surrealist and abstract expressionist techniques. She is best known for her participation in San Francisco community mural art movements and for the art piece, Family Expectations, which depicts an intricate composition of several women whose appearances indicates family union. == Biography == Rivera was born in 1947 in El Salvador and grew up in the Mission District of San Francisco, California. She moved to the Mission District during 1959, and she was one of the painters the Si Se Puede wall painting in Cesar E. Chavez Elementary School, the very elementary school she attended. The Si Se Puede wall mural portrays Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, and farmworker figures and is currently adorning the playground of the elementary school. During her residence at San Francisco, she married Brooke Oliver, a lawyer who serves on the Latino Community Advisory Board and the Calle 24 Council. Together, they created the Que Viva! Camp at Burning Man. Since then, her produced artwork has been shown in shows such as the DeYoung, Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts, Precita Eyes, and her public and private exhibitions. She currently works with her wife at 50 Balmy Law, a firm that focuses on providing inventive, lawful solutions and support in workmanship, charitable, copyrights, trademarks, and exposure rights law. On Balmy Alley, one of her murals called Tribute to Mujeres Muralistas, is currently embellished right across from her office. == Education == Rivera attended Cesar E. Chavez Elementary School in San Francisco for primary education. She attended Laney College as an art major. == Murals == San Francisco Mural Movement Rivera participated in the Mission District community mural movement that highlighted the home, heritage, family, and community of Mexican culture in the San Francisco area. She assisted muralist Susan Cervantes, a 47-year veteran artist who was one of the leaders of the mural movement and joined the Precita Eyes Muralists group, founded by Cervantes and her late husband, and helped paint murals on schools, parks, organizations, private living arrangements, and more. Through collaborative murals, Precita Eyes' murals address issues of class endeavors, prejudice, persecution and celebrate culture, unity, history, and nature.

The project took place focusing on women, water, and globalization with financial sponsorship. Juana Alicia wanted to highlight the issues underlying the conflicts of women around the world with the subject being La Llorona, foregrounding the exemplary Mexican legend of the lady who killed her children by drowning them in the river and is cursed to look for them. The blue mural also has other subjects such as women in Bolivia, India, and at the U.S. border. These women are featured in the mural for the challenges that they faced, such as water rights and unsolved homicides of women in Juarez. The La Llorona mural is located near Juana Alicia's Las Lechugeueras, also known as The Women Lettuce Workers, which portrays farmworkers' rights for better working conditions and pesticide harming in California. The mural was taken down due to the water damage done to the wall with a 90-day warning, and instead, Juana Alicia created the La Llorona mural to take its place. == Artworks == Family Expectations This artwork, created in 1993, shows figures of women whose appearances suggest family unification with a traditional and realistic composition. The women are wearing distinctive outfits with a vivid color scheme, representing different generations. The women are not smiling in the artwork except for one woman and her baby that are within a rectangular shape in the artwork. The intent was to emphasize on the freedom of self-prediction and interpretation. The medium of this artwork is oil on canvas, and the canvas size is 3 feet and 2 inches x 2 feet and 6 inches. Oil Spill This artwork, created in 1994, is a surrealist painting that features a dying bird symbolizing negligent homicide. The dying bird has a human head. With this artwork, Rivera wanted to expose the brutality to animal life and highlight mankind's apathy towards animals. The dark background highlights the misery of the occasion and makes a sharp differentiation between the winged animal and its natural surroundings. There is also a black swan in the environment that is covered in oil that symbolizes humanity’s negligence for animals. Eye to We This artwork, created in 1994, is a surrealist painting that portrays an otherworldly presentation that consists of naked structures skipping about underwater. The naked structures have no heads, and they are swimming in the midst of a massive figure that has a single colossal eye. The massive figure with the eye is not peering at the headless naked structures which are swimming around but at the viewers themselves. This artwork mostly consists of overlapping headless naked figures that depict primarily female bodies and the blue water environment harmonizes with the figures. The medium of this artwork is oil on canvas, and the canvas size is 3 feet and 2 ¼ inches x 4 feet. Oakland Bay Bridge This artwork, created in 1994, is a colorful display of a well-known landmark. Rivera uses her expressionistic and primitive approach for this artwork to make a dramatic rendition of the landmark. Although the artwork is titled Oakland Bay Bridge, the bridge is not the main subject of the painting. There is a progression of houses strewn across the bay, and there are hillsides in the red landscape. The medium of this artwork is oil on canvas, and the canvas size is 3 feet and 3 inches x 4 feet and 6 inches. Limbs This artwork, created in 1993, consists of many dots that are prevalent in her artwork. The background is an ultramarine blue sky, and clouds are concealed behind tree limbs. The atmosphere is full of clouds while the tree limbs overlap them. The limbs are in the form of human arms and legs, and the limbs seem to be grabbing upward as though trying to uncover one’s presence. The Matador This artwork, created in 1992, depicts a matador with a red cape. There are folds and wrinkles of the matador’s red cape, and its composition highlights them. There is also another matador on the right side. The medium of the artwork is oil on canvas, and the size of the canvas is 5 feet x 4 feet. == Exhibitions == Solo Exhibitions * 1994 - Open Studio in Oakland, California * 1995 - Ethnic Trip Studio in San Francisco, California Group Exhibition * 1995 - Somar Gallery in San Francisco, California == References == == Bibliography == *50 Balmy Law P.C., www.50balmy.com/. *Ancona, George.

Pages 844-845 He was famous for his honesty and integrity, which Peter the Great appreciated in him in the first place. ==Origin== The son of the organist Yaguzhinsky, a native of Lithuania,Alexander Orlov, Natalia Georgieva, Vladimir Georgiev Historical Dictionary. 2nd edition. Moscow, 2012. Page 588 he probably originated from the town of Kublichi of the Połock Voivodeship of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (now the Ushachy district, the Vitebsk Region, Belarus). In 1687, together with his father's family, he arrived in Russia. Thanks to his sharpness and sense of duty, he proved himself in the service of Fedor Golovin (as a page, then as a Page of the Chamber). In 1701 he was enlisted in the guard, in the Preobrazhensky Regiment, becoming the orderly of Tsar Peter the Great in place of Menshikov.\\"According to the testimony of one of the people close to him, at that time, at night, Peter was twitching such convulsions all over his body, that he put one of the orderlies on the bed and could only fall asleep by holding his shoulders\\". (Mikhail Semevsky. Tsaritsa Katerina Alekseevna. Moscow, 1994. Page 49). From the Lutheran faith he moved to the Orthodox. ==Diplomatic missions of Peter I== In 1710 – the captain of the Preobrazhensky Regiment. He married Anna Feodorovna Khitrovo and received a large dowry for her, which included, among other things, the village of Avchurino (manor) and the village of Sergeevskoye (now Plavsk). Even earlier (July 9, 1706), an island on the Yauza River near German Settlement was received from Peter I into eternal possession.Vasily Fursenko. Yagushinsky (Yaguzhinsky), Pavel Ivanovich // Russian Biographical Dictionary: in 25 volumes. – St. Petersburg – Moscow, 1896–1918. During the Northern War, Yaguzhinsky regularly performed Peter's diplomatic missions, and in 1713 traveled abroad with him.Peter's time in faces. Publishing House of the State Hermitage Museum, 2007. Page 60 In 1711 he participated in the Prut campaign. In the same year, he accompanied Peter to Carlsbad and Torgau to the wedding of Tsarevich Alexei. In June 1711 he received the rank of colonel, on August 3, 1711 – Adjutant general. On February 19, 1712, he became the second in Russian history (after Semyon Naryshkin) who was granted the rank of chamberlain. Yaguzhinsky is one of the few who attended the king's marriage to Marta Skavronskaya. In November 1713 he was sent to the Copenhagen court with the notice of the arrival of Peter the Great with the army in the duchy of Mecklenburg. In 1714, he again came to Denmark in order to, together with the resident Vasily Dolgorukov, urge the Danish crown to fulfill allied obligations. After the establishment of the collegiums in 1718, Yaguzhinsky was entrusted with the observation of the \\"soonest possible establishment of colleges by their presidents\\". A year later, he took part in the Åland Congress, then in 1720–21 he represented the interests of Russia at the Viennese court of the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, where he found a troupe of comedians for the king. Yaguzhinsky left for the Nystad Congress on August 24, 1721, but at the request of his rival Osterman, the Vyborg commandant Ivan Shuvalov delayed him in Vyborg for two whole days, and when Pavel Yaguzhinsky arrived in Nystad, the peace was already concluded. ==Creation of assemblies and divorce with wife== As a young man, Yaguzhinsky had the reputation of \\"a cheerful interlocutor, a jovial and tireless dancer\\", as well as the king of all dances, who keenly followed the visits to the assemblies and compiled lists of the absent courtiers for the king. Not a single assembly, when Yaguzhinsky was in Russia, did not do without his presence, and if, having drunk, he would start dancing, he would dance till drop. Loving the fun, festive life, Yaguzhinsky led it on a grand scale, spending on furnishings, servants, trips, and other things. Peter the Great, needing luxurious carriages for ceremonial receptions, more than once temporarily took them from Yaguzhinsky. \\"Having established the obligatory assemblies, Peter laid them under the supervision of Yaguzhinsky, and in this position he showed the same zeal, diligence and speed with which he carried out all the orders of his sovereign\\". The marriage of Yaguzhinsky with a rich and well-born heiress, which took place with the live participation of Peter the Great, Anna Feodorovna Khitrovo (1701–1733), was unsuccessful. Yaguzhinsky, accompanying the emperor, was often on the road. His wife, separated from her children, lived mainly in Moscow, where she could not boast of exemplary behavior: In 1721, at the wedding of Yuri Trubetskoy, there was a public quarrel between Yaguzhinsky and his wife, according to the ceremony she had to dance with her husband, but refused. Bergholz, who saw her in 1722, wrote that she almost did not go anywhere and living in Saint Petersburg did not leave the house, as she was constantly ill and was suffering from \\"melencolia\\".Friedrich Wilhelm Berchholz. Diary 1721-1725 / Translation from German by Ivan Ammon. - Moscow, 1902 Soon, Anna Feodorovna was placed in one of the Moscow monasteries, and Yaguzhinsky, partly due to the insistence of Peter I, addressed the Synod with a request for divorce \\"so that I would not continue in such a disastrous and otherwise life, but my poor little children would not have suffered from such an indecent mother\\". Yaguzhinskaya justified her, saying that \\"she did these indecent acts in her unconsciousness and melancholy, which happened in Petersburg in 1721, and in grief and sorrow from separation from her roommate and children, from boredom and loneliness\\". It was one of the first divorce proceedings in Russia and, of course, it caused a lot of talk. Valishevsky argues that even before the beginning of the divorce, Yaguzhinsky had found a prominent bride — one of the daughters of the great Chancellor Golovkin named Anna. The permission to divorce was followed on August 21, 1723, and on November 10, Saint Petersburg was celebrating a magnificent wedding. According to Bassevich, Yaguzhinsky \\"was just as pleased with his second wife as his emperor was pleased with emperor's wife\\".Peter the Great: Memories (editor - Evgeny Anisimov). Pushkin Foundation, 1993. Page 170 At the request of Yaguzhinsky, his first wife, by the decree of Empress Catherine I, was imprisoned in the Theodore Monastery \\"until the end of her days\\", from where she tried to escape twice, but was caught. She died, having lived in a monastery for ten years, as a nun with the name of Agafya. ==Attorney General== From January 22, 1722 – lieutenant-general. Four days earlier, he was appointed the first ever Prosecutor General of the Governing Senate. In modern terminology, this post corresponds to the Attorney General.General Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation  History in faces His duties included the fight against embezzlement: According to the characteristics of the Soviet historical encyclopedia, the first prosecutor general \\"was distinguished by directness, honesty and integrity, tirelessness in the work\\".Yaguzhinsky Pavel Ivanovich // Soviet historical encyclopedia. - Moscow: Soviet Encyclopedia. Edited by Yevgeny Zhukov. 1973-1982. Volume 16. Pages 844-845 There is a case in which, irritated by the general embezzlement, Peter I demanded in the Senate to adopt a law according to which everyone who steals more than a piece of rope from the state will be on this rope hanged. Shocked senators depressed silent. Finally, the almighty prosecutor general Pavel Yaguzhinsky, an honest and charming alcoholic, answered the king that then Peter would not have a single citizen, because \\"we all steal, who are more, who are less\\". Shocked by this answer that entered the history of Russia, the tsar did not dare to adopt such a law. The emperor tirelessly noted the merits of Yaguzhinsky. In May 1724, at the establishment of the coronation of Catherine I of the Chevalier Guard Regiment, he was appointed its commander with the rank of lieutenant captain. Received in eternal possession of Mishin Island in the mouth of the Neva. In 1720, a three-storey stone house was built for Yaguzhinsky under the project of Georg Mattarnovi and Nikolai Gerbel on the Neva Embankment. As prosecutor general, Yaguzhinsky served as a counterweight to the powerful Prince Menshikov and somewhat limited his appetites. At the court in Yaguzhinsky, they saw \\"the accuser and enemy of all those personal and self-seeking aspirations\\" that were characteristic of \\"Peter's nestlings\\". After Catherine I assumed the throne, the procurator general began to quarrel openly with Menshikov, who had strengthened his position, still did not miss a single court drinking party, and during the vigil in Peter and Paul Cathedral appealed for protection to the coffin of the late emperor, so they feared that he might \\"in a fit of despair, lay hands on himself\\". After the establishment of the Supreme Privy Council and the establishment of the Menshik omnipotence, Yaguzhinsky left the post of procurator-general and was sent on August 3, 1726 as plenipotentiary minister to the Polish Sejm in Grodno, where the issue of Courland succession was examined.Anatoly Shikman. Figures of national history. Biographical directory. Moscow, 1997 Since October 24, 1727, he was a general-in-chief, although he did not serve in the army for a long time. ==Conflict with Osterman== The inscription on the grave of Yaguzhinsky Ober-Stallmeister Yaguzhinsky, in subsequent administrations, was maneuvering between opposing court factions with some success. In January 1730, he participated in the conspiracy of the \\"supremes\\", but, having lost faith in its success, on January 20 he informed Anna Ioannovna of everything, explaining to her that most nobles did not want to limit her power. On January 16, 1730 was arrested, but soon released. Anna Ioannovna fully rewarded the renegade. By decree of the Empress on March 4, 1730, Yaguzhinsky was appointed senator.Holders of the Imperial Order of St. Alexander Nevsky. Volume 1. - Moscow: Russian World, 2009. - In the same year (December 20), a rich Siberian Order was subordinated, from which he was to receive a salary \\"by rank\\". From December 31, 1730 – Lieutenant Colonel of the Life Guard Horse Regiment. In the period from October 2, 1730 to 1731 – the Prosecutor General of the Senate. On his initiative, the first Russian Cadet Corps was created. On January 19, 1731 was awarded the title of count. Quarrel with Osterman put an end to influence of Yaguzhinsky. On the day when Osterman celebrated the receipt of the title of count, Yaguzhinsky drank too much and began to shower his enemy in a foul language, for which the empress only slightly scolded him. The vice- chancellor, who did not forget the offense, soon achieved the establishment of the Cabinet of Ministers and the transfer of basic governmental functions to this body. Yaguzhinsky saw power slipping from his hands. The Empress ordered Yaguzhinsky to leave her court and sent him to another honorary exile – ambassador to Berlin. At the same time he was deprived of the ober- stallmeister court position (1732).Olga Sukhareva. Who was who in Russia from Peter I to Paul I. Moscow, 2005 However, two years later, Biron, having no means to overcome Osterman's influence, began to bother about Yaguzhinsky's return to Russia. He entered on April 28, 1735 into the Cabinet of Ministers with the return of the post of ober-stallmeister. From April 18, 1735 to April 6, 1736 – Cabinet Minister. Yaguzhinsky's health was already shaken long ago, and not so much by the busy life and the exorbitant work that he carried without rest for many years, as by binges and all sorts of excesses. With his age of 52 and gout, he should have had a more modest lifestyle. But he did not let up, he invariably attended dances and feasts, where he drank without lagging behind others. In January 1736, he fell ill with fever, which was complicated by gout attacks, and died in April of the same year. He was buried in the Annunciation Church of the Alexander Nevsky Monastery. His second-hand widow married the diplomat Mikhail Bestuzhev-Ryumin. In 1743, in a Lopukha case, she was publicly carved with a whip and sent to Yakutsk exile. ==Reviews of contemporaries== In notes, the Spanish ambassador, the Duke of Lyria, reports about him: ==Awards== *Order of Saint Andrew (July 11, 1724) *Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky (August 30, 1725) ==Family== Countess Praskovya Yaguzhinskaya, married Princess Gagarin #Wife from 1710, Anna Fedorovna Khitrovo (died July 30, 1733), the only daughter of the clerk Fedor Alexandrovich Khitrovo (died 1703), the granddaughter of Alexander Khitrovo, a rich and influential man.

Kamien was made notorious for challenging gender and class norms along with creating works that parodied classical ballet by mixing the dance style with contemporary dance. Kamien is best known for her self-titled piece Ana Kamien (1970), a 16mm dance film she produced with the help of filmmaker Marcelo Epstein. Rodrigo Alonso, an art critic and historian, described the piece as \\"not only one of the first examples of dance for the camera in Argentina: it is also one of the best.\\" == Biography == Ana Kamien was born in the year 1935 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Her father was a Polish immigrant who arrived in Argentina before World War II and her mother was a Ukrainian immigrant. She grew up in the Argentine neighborhood of Parque Patricios with her parents. Kamien was first introduced to dance through a class at her mother's night school. Kamien's mother did not have a sitter, so Kamien would go with her mother and stay in the dance room at her local night school while her mother attended class. She grew close to the dance teacher, Flora Martinez, and was able to attend dance classes for free. She presented her first public dance, Vals de las Flores, at the age of three years old at the night schools festival for children. At the age of 11, Kamien met Lida Martinolli at the Hurricane Club and joined Teatro Colón. She felt alone and intimidated by the many girls but continued with her lessons. At the age of 15, she received a card from a friend in Tucuman raving about a contemporary dance teacher named Renate Schottelius. She arrived at one of Schottelius's classes with her mother and was impressed by the dance techniques. She found a job at a bank after graduating from secondary school in the 1950s, allowing her to help support her family. In 1958, Kamien entered the Universidad de Buenos Aires to focus on contemporary dance. Here she met fellow dancer Marilu Marini who she would later go on to choreograph many dance pieces alongside. Kamien studied with many different dance professionals such as Renate Schottelius, Maria Fux, and Dore Hoyer. In 1969, Kamien and her husband Leone Sonnino opened up a multipurpose space in the San Telmo neighborhood of Buenos Aires. Kamien would teach contemporary techniques meanwhile Sonnino used the remaining space as a photography studio. According to Kamien, > \\"The dance studios were relatively safe spaces. I think they were safer than > theaters, where the word is used and things are said. They were gathering > places. The studios were filled with people. Even though it seems odd, they > were filled with men; the men felt safe, it was a place where they felt they > could express themselves, that they could be, that they could express > themselves in all possible forms. They were, I believe, cultural and > expensive asylums. It was a great boom.\\" Kamien currently resides in Buenos Aires, Argentina. == Notable performances == ===Ana Kamien=== This piece was choreographed by Kamien herself at the Centro Cultural General San Martin in 1970. This piece explicitly critiqued the military violence in Argentina at the time of Juan Carlos Ongania's dictatorship in the late 1960s. It aligned with the broader struggles for labor rights and the fight against the military.Fortuna, Victoria. Moving Otherwise: Dance, Violence, and Memory in Buenos Aires. Oxford University Press, 2019. ===Danza Actual=== This was a dance group co-created by Kamien, Marilu Marini and Graciela Martinez in 1963 at the Instituto Torcuato Di Tella in Buenos Aires. It combined ballet with folk and pop music as well as the worlds of comics, Hollywood movies, music hall and fashion photography. === Danse Bouquet === Choreographed in 1965, Marilu Marini and Kamien worked together again to create this piece at the Instituto Torcuato Di Tella Institute Audiovisual Experimentation Center in Buenos Aires. The performance parodied the artistic elitism the choreographers felt through the other sectors of the Buenos Aires concert dance scene. It aimed to \\"avoid all the affectations: those of classical dance and those of modern dance\\" by transgressing the norms of concert dance production and challenged offstage gender norms during the early 1960s. === La Fiesta Hoy === Also known as \\"The Party Today!,\\" it was created Marilu Marini and Ana Kamien created this piece in 1966 at the Instituto Torcuato Di Tella in Buenos Aires.

The leaves are dark green above, paler below, lance-shaped, varying in size from long, from wide and sessile or with a short petiole. The flowers are white and arranged in compact groups of up to thirty, each flower on a pedicel long. The floral cup is conical to top-shaped or cup-shaped, with five papery sepals about long and wide. There are five or six egg-shaped to almost round petals long and wide. Between fifteen and sixty stamens, some slightly longer than the petals and others much shorter are arranged in two indistinct rows around the floral cup. Flowering occurs between April and June and is followed by fruit which is a hairy, conical to more or less top-shaped capsule long and wide. The capsule usually opens to release its seed when mature. ==Taxonomy and naming== Kunzea robusta was first formally described in 2014 by the Peter James de Lange from a specimen he collected near Papatea Bay. The description was published in PhytoKeys. The specific epithet (robusta) is a Latin word meaning \\"hard and strong like oak\\", referring to the stature of mature trees of this species. ==Distribution and habitat== Rawirinui is widespread and common on both the North and South Islands of New Zealand, and has often been confused with K. ericoides. It is mostly found in coastal and low-lying areas and nearby hilly country, especially around forest margins and does not usually grow in upper montane situations. ==References== Category:Flora of New Zealand robusta Category:Plants described in 2014 Category:Taxa named by Peter James de Lange ","title":"Kunzea robusta"},{"id":"60390205","text":"Cedar Hills Regional Landfill is a municipal landfill near Maple Valley, Washington, United States. It is operated by the King County Solid Waste Division and encompasses of space near State Route 169. The landfill opened in 1963 and is the county's only active waste facility, serving an estimated 1.4 million people in King County—excluding the cities of Seattle and Milton. Cedar Hills was originally anticipated to be full by 2012, but recent estimates have pushed the date back to 2028, with further expansion planned. The landfill continues to receive of trash per day and has a population of bald eagles and other birds that frequent the area and deposit trash in surrounding neighborhoods. ==Facilities== The Cedar Hills Regional Landfill is located southeast of Renton near Maple Valley. The landfill is divided between nine areas that have been continually expanded since the 1980s. The facility continues to take in of garbage delivered by 130 trucks from the county's transfer facilities. A bioenergy plant uses collected methane from the landfill to produce electricity for the Puget Sound Energy grid. ==History== The state government originally owned the undeveloped Cedar Hills site and signed a 40-year lease with King County in 1960. The site was divided between a central landfill, established in 1964, and a rehabilitation center for alcoholics. The central facility at Cedar Hills replaced a system of 16 open landfills that were operated by the county until the late 1960s. The facility was initially expected to handle the county's garbage needs for up to 40–50 years, but the addition of a contract with the City of Seattle caused capacity concerns by the late 1960s. The county government paid $350,000 to acquire a high-density compactor in 1968 that doubled capacity at Cedar Hills. The machine compressed garbage into a tenth of its original volume and deposited bales of compressed garbage into open trenches. King County operated several other landfills, including a \\"backup\\" site for Cedar Hills near Issaquah, but they ceased operations in the 1980s in favor of expanding Cedar Hills. The City of Seattle diverted its garbage to the Midway Landfill in Kent in the mid-1970s, but returned to Cedar Hills in 1987. To reduce the burden of garbage disposal at Cedar Hills, Puget Sound Energy proposed the construction of a waste-to-energy incineration plant in 1980, but the proposal was repeatedly declined by the county government. A nearby composting facility was opened by a private operator in 1989. Cedar Hills was designated as a high- risk hazardous site by the Washington State Department of Ecology in 1992 due to the presence of arsenic, lead, and benzene in groundwater. , liquids from the oldest sections of the landfill are anticipated to seep into an underground aquifer by 2058. The landfill is also home to a population of bald eagles, ravens, crows, and seagulls who pick up garbage and drop pieces in surrounding neighborhoods. The county government uses fireworks and other countermeasures to deter the birds, and have sought permission to use similar tactics against the bald eagles. ==References== Category:Landfills in the United States Category:Renton, Washington Category:1963 establishments in Washington (state) ","title":"Cedar Hills Regional Landfill"},{"id":"60390211","text":"Pahangone is a genus of dwarf spiders containing the single species, Pahangone mirabilis.

Mainly working in the Newcastle upon Tyne area, he designed municipal buildings, churches and over one hundred houses and housing schemes in the North East of England. ==Early life== Burns Dick was born in Stirling but moved to Newcastle as a child where his father worked in the brewing trade. He was educated in the Royal Grammar School and went on to go to Art School. He went on to be articled to William Lister Newcombe. ==Career== Pilgrim Street Central Police and Fire Station In 1888 he became an assistant in the office of Armstrong & Knowles of Newcastle Upon Tyne, remaining there until 1893 when he set up his own firm. In 1895, Burns Dick formed a partnership with Charles Thomas Marshall, born 1866, who had been an apprentice in Newcombe's office alongside Dick and set-up an independent practice in Newcastle in 1892. The next year they won the competition for the design of the Corporation Lodging House in Aberdeen. Their partnership ended in 1897, with Marshall moving office in 1899 to London and Burns Dick was taken into partnership by the older James Thorburn Cackett, the practice name becoming Cackett & Burns Dick. Generally, Cackett worked on the business side, and Burns Dick provided the artistic input. Cackett retired in 1920, and by 1923 Robert MacKellar, born 1880, was taken into partnership. The practice was renamed Burns Dick & MacKellar at the time of Cackett's death in 1928 and still trades today under MacKellar Schwerdt Partnership. The first important building he was solely responsible for designing was the Berwick police station in 1901. He designed other important buildings before World War One including the Spanish City in Whitley Bay, Cross House and Laing Art Gallery. Burns Dick became a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects on 8 January 1906, and in 1914–18 was the President of the Northern Architectural Association, and during this time he wrote a number of articles on the effects of war on architecture. During the Great War, Burns Dick and Cackett designed the Armstrong Naval Yard and worked for the Short Brothers at the Royal Airship Works in Cardington, Bedfordshire which included the building of the village of Shortstown to house the workers. Also, he served as a captain in the Royal Garrison Artillery. After the war, he got involved in municipal housing and was influenced by the Garden city movement and designed the Pendower council housing estate based on the layout of an English village with the density of twelve to eighteen houses per acre rather than the usual twenty. In 1924 he was a founding member of the Newcastle Upon Tyne Society to Improve the Beauty, Health and Amenities of the City which aimed to regenerate the city centre and give Newcastle a green belt. Later he became chair of the Newcastle Town Planning Committee. He designed the granite towers on the Tyne Bridge, originally planning for a grand arched entrance to the city which was never built. He later went on to design the Grade II listed buildings of Newcastle University Students' Union, in 1924, and Central Police Station, Magistrates Court and Fire Station, in 1934, which won national acclaim. At the time the Evening Chronicle said: \\"Could Mr Burns Dick have the opportunity of replanning Newcastle as he planned this building, the city might become a modern Athens or Rome.\\" ==Later life and death== Burns Dick retired to Esher, Surrey in 1940 and died in 1954. ==References== ==External links== * Burns Dick (Robert) Archive - Newcastle University Category:1868 births Category:1954 deaths Category:Architects from Northumberland ","title":"Robert Burns Dick"},{"id":"60390243","text":"Tegulinus is a genus of Indonesian dwarf spiders first described by A.

The founding principle of Mondongo is working in group and to make their art a massive issue. The studio that Mondongo operates out of is privately owned in Buenos Aires, but is open to visitors. The studio and surrounding area not only supports, but encourages conversation. The idea of conversation can be seen in many of her pieces via symbols like masks and faces. Laffitte's cousin was shot years ago by the Argentinian army which inspires many of her pieces. == Artworks == Juliana Laffitte is noted for her use of unconventional materials In 2004, The Spanish Royal Family commissioned Juliana Laffitte and Mondongo to create portraits of the family.

Precythe, 587 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case regarding the standards for challenging methods of capital punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In a 5–4 decision, the Court held that when a convict sentenced to death challenges the State's method of execution due to claims of excessive pain, the convict must show that other alternative methods of execution exist and clearly demonstrate they would cause less pain than the state-determined one.. The Court's opinion emphasized the precedential force of its prior decisions in Baze v. Rees and Glossip v. Gross. ==Background== In March 1996, Russell Earl Bucklew (May 16, 1968 – October 1, 2019) murdered Michael Sanders, with whom his former girlfriend Stephanie Ray took shelter after the breakup of their relationship, then kidnapped and raped Ray. He was sentenced to death by the state of Missouri in May 1997, and failed to have the conviction overturned in legal challenges which had completed by 2006. During this period, Missouri, as well as several other states, changed its protocol for death sentences by lethal injection to a combination of drugs. Missouri itself had to clear this change through the courts, so from 2006 through 2010, only two inmates were executed. Bucklew and other convicts with death sentences across the country attempted to legally challenge states' refusal to use other protocols besides lethal injection through the courts, arguing that this was a violation of their Eighth Amendment rights. This ultimately resulted in Baze v. Rees, decided by the Supreme Court in 2008, where it was determined that lethal injection by drugs was constitutional and did not violate the Eighth Amendment. Further, Baze established a test for future challenges to methods of execution under the Eighth Amendment, in that inmates must show that a \\"feasible, readily implemented\\" alternative procedure that would \\"significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain\\". With the decision in Baze, the Supreme Court invalidated the other ongoing challenges, including that of Bucklew, and ordered states who had already gained approval for lethal injection to resume executions. However, Missouri was forced to put its death penalties on hold, as one of the companies providing one of the injected drugs, sodium thiopental, had been pressured by anti-death penalty advocates and its dwindling supplies to stop selling the drug for such purposes. By 2012, Missouri had altered its process to a single drug, first to propofol and later to pentobarbital, and in 2014, began scheduling lethal injections, including for Bucklew. Bucklew sought a new lawsuit on challenging the use of the new drug for lethal injection on the basis that due his own personal health, suffering from cavernous hemangioma, that the injection could cause vascular tumors that would not allow the drug to properly circulate, and thus could experience tremendous pain before the drug shut down his systems. Bucklew asserted both facial and as-applied challenges. While the district court denied his challenge, the Supreme Court agreed to put the execution on hold to allow his appeals to be heard. In the Eighth Circuit, the court rejected Bucklew's facial challenge, as well as turned down his as-applied challenge as given but allowed Bucklew's case to be reheard if he could demonstrate that there was a feasible alternative, as per Baze. Prior to the rehearing, the Supreme Court concluded in Glossip v. Gross in 2015 that affirmed the Baze requirement that an Eighth Amendment challenge to capital punishment puts the onus on inmates to show that there exists an alternative that is \\"feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduces a substantial risk of severe pain.\\" When Bucklew returned to court in 2015 he had amended his claim with the suggestion that lethal gas was a viable alternative to lethal injection, and later identified nitrogen as a viable alternative (e.g. via inert gas asphyxiation). This gave enough possibility of a triable remedy that allowed the case to proceed to an additional discovery phase. Bucklew had brought in an expert witness in anesthesiology who had affirmed that even after the injection Bucklew would still have brain function and could experience pain, based on a study done with horses. Eventually both the district and Eighth Circuit rejected these claims. The Supreme Court intervened a second time, in early 2018, while Justice Anthony Kennedy had still been serving, to put Bucklew's case on hold and evaluate his case. ==Supreme Court== The Court issued its opinion on April 1, 2019. In a 5–4 decision falling along ideological lines, the Court upheld the Eighth Circuit's decision, affirming that Baze and Glossip provided the proper tests, and the evidence presented by Bucklew was not sufficient for either a facial or as-applied challenge to the Eighth Amendment. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion, joined by the other four conservative Justices. Gorsuch wrote that the Eighth Amendment \\"forbids 'cruel and unusual' methods of capital punishment but does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death\\"; while a constitutionally-valid death sentencing like hanging would require a moment of intense pain, the Eighth Amendment would forbid methods like being drawn and quartered that \\"intensified the death sentence by 'superadding' terror, pain or disgrace.\\" Gorsuch criticized the choice of death by inert gas asphyxiation, as it was neither a method prescribed by Missouri, and while it was an authorized method in three other states, no one has been put to death by the method to date. Gorsuch also wrote that Bucklew, by this point, had spent twenty years on death row, and there is reasonable expectation by states to complete death sentences in a timely manner. Gorsuch argued that inmates that were seeking alternative methods under the Baze/Glossip test in good faith should readily be able to show evidence for their case, and considered that Bucklew's continuing challenges were stalling tactics. Both Thomas and Kavanaugh wrote concurring opinions. Thomas argued that under the Eighth Amendment, the Court only had to show that Missouri's choice of death sentence was not purposely designed to inflict additional pain on the inmate. The dissenting opinion was written by Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by the other three liberal justices on the bench. Breyer argued that Bucklew had sufficiently demonstrated that death by lethal injection could cause unnecessary intense pain and an \\"excruciating and grotesque\\" execution due to his conditions, and in his as-applied challenge, that death by nitrogen gas met the standards for Baze and Glossip. While Missouri did not use this method, it was in use in three other states. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a separate opinion, urging that there is no reason to rush execution sentences, particularly to avoid having any judicial mistakes harm the impact of the Constitution. ==Execution== On June 25, 2019, the Missouri Supreme Court scheduled an execution date of October 1 for Bucklew. Missouri Governor Mike Parson denied clemency for Bucklew on the morning of his planned execution, and he was executed as scheduled on October 1, 2019. He was pronounced dead at 6:23 pm CST, eight minutes after being administered a lethal dose of pentobarbital. There were no reported complications with the execution. Corrections staff took precautions with Bucklew such as elevating the head of the gurney to prevent his choking on blood if a tumor were to burst and sedating him with Valium before the execution.https://theappeal.org/missouri- executes-russell-bucklew-threat-botched-execution/ ==See also== *List of offenders executed in the United States in 2019 ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause and death penalty case law Category:Capital punishment in Missouri ","title":"Bucklew v.

After this victory, racism in Brazilian football started to drop, with several clubs including black people in their squads and even the national team. The championship also contributed to increase the popularity of the sport in the country. Nevertheless, President of Brazil, Epitácio Pessoa, banned black players from the national team so Friedenreich could not attend the 1920 and 1921 editions in Chile and Argentina respectively.
