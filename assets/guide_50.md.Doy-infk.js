He performed at various nightclubs along the Atlantic Seaboard, and the national black press covered his life in detail. Garrison was the child of Rosa Keeling and Will Garrison. He was born on June 4, 1908, and grew up in Washington, DC. At twelve years old, he debuted in a popular local variety show, The Rosetime Revue. Although he danced in costume, he likely did not begin performing as a female impersonator until adulthood. Writing in the Baltimore Afro-American, Ralph Matthews noted that Garrison ‚Äúhiked off to New York and almost became a Gene Malin or a Karyle Norman before he returned to Washington‚Äù where he had ‚Äúunusual success as a night club entertainer.‚Äù By 1934, Garrison had won more than twenty ‚Äúbest dressed‚Äù prizes at drag balls in Baltimore and Washington, DC. He reportedly favored squirrel or mink wraps with accessories. Louis Lautier said that Garrison's ‚Äúfemale impersonation [was] almost perfect.‚Äù Amid an increase in policing of gender nonconformity and waning popularity of female impersonators, Garrison had little employment in the last year of his life. Upon his death, the Baltimore Afro-American printed that he ‚Äúhad been melancholy and subject to brooding since the death of his god-mother, who reared him from a child.‚Äù Further, he avoided friends and ‚Äúdrifted around the city during the past few months ill and undernourished.‚Äù He had been found lying ‚Äúprostrate in a vacant lot‚Äù and later died in Gallinger Hospital. In 2018, Kim Gallon, a historian at Purdue University, published an extensive account of Garrison's life in the Journal of the History of Sexuality. Gallon's archival research is the most significant source for this Wikipedia entry. == References == Category:1908 births Category:1938 deaths Category:American drag queens Category:Ball culture Category:People from Washington, D.C.

Gordon is an American NASCAR crew chief who currently works for Team Penske as the crew chief for Ryan Blaney in the No. 12 Ford Mustang in the NASCAR Cup Series. He has worked for Penske since 2011. During his time there, he is most notable for being the crew chief for Joey Logano from 2013 to 2019 on the team's No. 22 car. The duo won the 2018 NASCAR Cup Series championship together and scored 21 wins together, which to date account for all of Gordon's wins as a crew chief in the Cup Series. Gordon was the crew chief for the No. 22 Cup car for one year before Logano drove it, when it was driven by A. J. Allmendinger and then Sam Hornish Jr. Prior to that, he crew chiefed Penske's No. 22 Nationwide (now Xfinity) Series car driven by Brad Keselowski, Kurt Busch, Sam Hornish Jr., and Jacques Villeneuve, where he led the team to the owner's championship. ==CareerDriving career=== Gordon began his career in racing as a driver, racing supermodifieds for three years at his home track of Oswego Speedway in New York state. He built the cars he raced in his college mechanical engineering program. ===1998‚Äì2010: Pre-Penske years=== Gordon began working in NASCAR mid-season in 1998 after graduating from college, getting his first job with Phil Parsons' No. 10 team in what was then the Busch Series. He left PPR for Joe Gibbs Racing in 2000, where he worked as a fabricator and later a mechanic. During the 2002 season, he left JGR for ppc Racing and began in similar roles before eventually becoming an engineer during his time there, and later made his debut as a crew chief sometime in 2004 on the No. 22 Ford of Jason Keller. He began crew chiefing permanently in 2005 for ppc Racing, calling the shots for their Busch Series No. 10 Ford driven by Mexican rookie Michel Jourdain Jr. After the team failed to qualify for the race at Chicago, Jourdain was demoted by the team from their full-time No. 10 car to their part-time No. 15 car and would only drive in select races for the remainder of the season. Replacing him was another one of the series' rookies that year, Brent Sherman, who moved over from the No. 58 Stringer Motorsports car to drive for PPC. That year, Gordon would lead the team to only one top ten finish, which was with Jourdain Jr. at Atlanta. In 2006, Sherman left for a Cup Series ride with BAM Racing and was replaced by John Andretti. However, Rick Gay served as Andretti's crew chief on the No. 10 car and not Gordon, who was the crew chief for the part-time No. 15 with Jourdain. Later in the year, Gordon replaced Randy Cox as the crew chief for the other PPC car, the No. 22 of Kenny Wallace. He joined Carl A. Haas Motorsports (formerly Travis Carter Racing) at the start of the 2007 season, where he worked on the team's No. 14 car in the Busch Series, driven by Kyle Krisiloff. He left that team for the new CJM Racing team, which moved from the Cup Series (No. 72 team) to the Busch Series (No. 11 team) during the season, and Gordon reunited with the team's driver Jason Keller as well as one race with Marc Mitchell. The team ran the full season in 2008 with Keller and Gordon returning, although Keller was replaced by rookie Scott Lagasse Jr. towards the end of the season. He also was concurrently the team's general manager. For 2009, Gordon paired with Keller for the third time, this time at Baker- Curb Racing in the No. 27 car. They scored six top ten finishes and finished eighth in the points that year. In 2010, Gordon did not crew chief any team, and joined Michael Waltrip Racing as the engineer for the team's No. 99 Toyota in the Nationwide Series that year, which was driven by Trevor Bayne and later the Truex brothers, Martin and Ryan, after Bayne left for the Roush Fenway Racing No. 17 car late in the season. Gordon standing beside the No. 22 car in 2016 Richmond in 2017 ===2020‚Äìpresent: Ryan Blaney=== Despite even having a solid 2019 season, Penske announced a crew chief shakeup for the 2020 season in an effort to be more competitive and dominant like the successes Joe Gibbs Racing was having. Gordon was moved from Logano's No. 22 to the No. 12 of Ryan Blaney, arguably the weakest Penske car at the time, with Blaney's crew chief Jeremy Bullins going to from Blaney's No. 12 to the No. 2 of Brad Keselowski, and Paul Wolfe switching from Keselowski's No. 2 to Logano's No. 22, replacing Gordon. The duo started the year off with a bang, as Blaney was in contention on the last lap to win the Daytona 500, but losing in a mostly-overlooked photo finish to Denny Hamlin due to Ryan Newman's scary flip across the finish line which injured him. Solid runs at the next two races of Las Vegas and Fontana put Blaney in the points lead for two races. Blaney would crash out at the next race at Phoenix, which dropped him to sixth in points before the two- month break of the season due to the coronavirus pandemic. ==Personal life== Gordon attended Clemson University where he earned a degree in mechanical engineering. He is from Camden, New York, but currently lives in Mooresville, North Carolina (near where most NASCAR teams are located) with his wife and two children.

Its fall also brought down its parent company British and Commonwealth Holdings, a financial services firm which had acquired it for ¬£434 million in 1988. The company leased computers systems using complex six- year 'Flexlease' agreements, which allowed a lessee to update to a new lease after three years or to cancel the lease after five years. These terms made Atlantic vulnerable to large liabilities incurred if invoked which were often not covered by the value of the equipment itself. During aquistition talks, Atlantic misrepresented its debts and by the time of its collapse, had more than ¬£550m in liabilities. While its American arm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on 5 July 1990, the British firm had been placed in administration with PricewaterhouseCoopers on 18th April. The group employed around 1,400 people at the time. A report into the failure of British and Commonwealth was set up by the Department of Trade and Industry and headed by Eben Hamilton QC and James Alexander Scott, an accountant. It found that Atlantic had never made a profit from its founding in 1975. After the report's release, three former directors of Atlantic (David Austin McCormick, Nicholas Scott and Sien Yen Cheng Kai On) faced disqualification at the behest of Michael Heseltine, then President of the Board of Trade. McCormick later appealed his disqualification but it was upheld. Many creditors had to wait for almost a decade to recoup their money after the collapses caused a string of insolvency lawsuits. ==See also== * Re Atlantic Computer Systems plc (No 1) - an important insolvency case regarding the administration process when a company is unable to pay its debts, resulting from Atlantic's collapse * Soden v British and Commonwealth Holdings plc - a 1998 case regarding the collapse of Atlantic's parent company ==References== Category:Computer companies disestablished in 1990 Category:1990 disestablishments in England Category:Computer companies established in 1975 Category:1975 establishments in England Category:British companies established in 1975 Category:American companies disestablished in 1990 Category:British companies disestablished in 1990 Category:Companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1990 ","title":"Atlantic Computers"},{"id":"63931511","text":"Jean de Brun de Boades was a French Navy officer.

It often appears together with the cities of Susa and Anshan in the early history of Mesopotamia, having many conflictual interactions with Sumer. The city of Awan still has not been located archaeologically. A dynasty of Elamite rulers was named after the city, the Awan Dynasty. It was founded by a ruler named Peli, and is therefore sometimes called \\"the dynasty of Peli\\". According to the Sumerian King List, Awan put an end to the First Dynasty of Ur circa 2450 BCE, and three kings of Awan then ruled over the southern regions of Sumer. Circa 2300-2200 BCE, the Akkadian Empire claimed numerous victories over Awan, under its rulers Sargon of Akkad and Rimush. Naram-Sin however signed an alliance with Khita, the 9th king of Awan. Awan wrestled independence from the Akkadians during the reign of Shar-Kali-Sharri. But some time later, the Awan Dynasty ended with the demise of its last king, Kutik-Inshushinak, followed by the control of the Third Dynasty of Ur over the region, circa 2100-2000 BCE.

Born in the Province of Treviso, he joined a light cavalry regiment as a lieutenant in 1797 and rose to the rank of colonel by the end of his career in 1814. He distinguished himself in several major battles of the Napoleonic wars, including the Battle of Wagram when he was awarded the Legion of Honor by Napoleon. After the fall of Napoleon in 1814, he was deeply involved in the Congiura di Brescia-Milano, a plot to overthrow Austrian rule in northern Italy. When the conspiracy was discovered, he was arrested and spent nearly four years in prison. Following his release in 1818 he devoted himself to literary pursuits and collecting military memorabilia. Gasparinetti was married to the opera singer Elisabetta Gafforini from 1812 until his death in Milan at the age of 47. ==BiographyEarly years=== Gasparinetti was born in Ponte di Piave in the Province of Treviso, the third child of Francesca n√©e Davanzo and Nicol√≤ Gasparinetti. His father was a prosperous rural landholder, while other members of the family had held prominent positions in the local government. As a young boy he was sent to Treviso to be educated by his paternal uncle who taught humanities and rhetoric at the city's seminary. In 1792 he enrolled at the University of Padua, initially intending to study medicine, but later switching to law. He began his literary activity while still a student there, producing a play and a novella in verse and several sonnets and odes. At the university he also formed what would be lifelong friendships with the poets Ugo Foscolo and Giuseppe Giulio Ceroni. All three of them shared ardent republican sympathies and all three became officers in Napoleon's Arm√©e d'Italie. Of the three, Gasparinetti would have the longest and most distinguished military career, although as with Foscolo and Ceroni, the political sentiments expressed in his poetry and oratory sometimes got him into trouble with his commanding officers. Eug√®ne de Beauharnais, Napoleon's Viceroy in Italy and the commander of the Arm√©e d'Italie, later recalled that Gasparinetti, Foscolo, and Ceroni gave him more trouble than the rest of the army combined. ===Military career and marriage=== The singer Elisabetta Gafforini who married Gasparinetti in 1812 Gasparinetti had inexplicably left the University of Padua in 1796 shortly before taking his final examinations and returned to his family's home in Ponte di Piave. The following year, he enlisted in the Arm√©e d'Italie. Over six feet tall and skilled in both firearms and horseback riding, he was given the rank of lieutenant in the newly formed light cavalry regiment (Chasseurs √† Cheval). He distinguished himself in the Battle of Genola and the Siege of Genoa where both he and Foscolo were wounded and rose to the rank of captain. His military service was interspersed with periods of leave during which he dedicated himself to his literary pursuits. After one such period in 1809, he planned to retire permanently from the army, but his regiment was called up for the War of the Fifth Coalition. Gasparinetti participated in several battles of that campaign, most notably the Battle of Wagram where he was wounded and taken prisoner by the Austrians. On his release, he was awarded the Legion of Honor by Napoleon. Gasparinetti was promoted to major in January 1812 as Napoleon was preparing for the invasion of Russia. Prior to his departure for the front, he married the opera singer Elisabetta Gafforini at the Chiesa di San Fedele in Milan on 1 April 1812. They had known each other since 1806 when he had published a sonnet and ode in her honour on the occasion of her return to La Scala from Lisbon. Their daughter and only child was born towards the end of 1812. They named her Eugenia after Eug√®ne de Beauharnais. Napoleon's attack on Russia and the subsequent disastrous retreat from Moscow ultimately decimated Gasparinetti's regiment. Wounded at the Battle of Vyazma, he managed to survive by feigning death, even when a Russian soldier cut off his finger to steal his ring as he lay on the ground. The loss of so many Italian commanding officers led to him being promoted to the rank of colonel in 1813. His regiment was sent into further battle in Germany but by then its remains had been absorbed into the I Corps led by General Vandamme. Gasparinetti was taken prisoner at the Battle of Kulm when the French troops were defeated with heavy losses. He was not able to return to Milan and his young family until May 1814. ===Plot of 1814 and later years=== Castello di San Giorgio in Mantua where Gasparinetti and his co-conspirators were imprisoned in 1814 The fall of Napoleon led to Austria re-taking control of Milan in May 1814. Gasparinetti was dismissed from the army along with many other officers who had been known to be ardent supporters of Napoleon. Already a Freemason and member of the Grand Orient of Italy, he became a prominent member of the Centri, a secret organization composed of military officers and intellectuals based in Mantua but with adherents throughout Lombardy and the Veneto. Their goal, according to Gian Bernardo Soveri Latuada, a lawyer and leading member of the Centri, was \\"to work for the moral and civil regeneration of the Italian people\\". However, many of them were also strongly in favour of a united Italy free from foreign domination. A number of Centri members, including Gasparinetti, Soveri Latuada, the physician Giovanni Rasori, Brigadier General Gaspare Bellotti, and severa other high-ranking ex-military officers, were involved in the Congiura di Brescia-Milano (\\"Brescia-Milan Conspiracy\\"), a plot to overthrow Austrian rule in northern Italy. When the plot was discovered by the Austrian authorities in December 1814, Gasparinetti and his co-conspirators were arrested and taken to Mantua for questioning. All of them were ultimately condemned to prison, Gasparinetti for five years. In December 1815, the Emperor of Austria Francis I visited Milan for the first time. Gasparinetti's wife, Elisabetta Gafforini, along with the wife of Rasori, the mother of Bellotti, and the brothers of several other conspirators submitted fulsome supplications to the emperor asking for their relatives' sentences to be commuted. Earlier that year Gafforini had come out of retirement to sing at La Scala in the premiere of Il mistico omaggio, a cantata celebrating the return of Austrian rule which was performed in the presence of Archduke John of Austria. In the end, the emperor reduced Gasparinetti's sentence by 18 months, and he was finally freed on 9 March 1818. Gasparinetti lived out his remaining years in Milan, devoting himself to his writing, including two more plays. The first of them, Bibli, was dedicated to his wife. He also built up a collection of military memorabilia and became a benefactor of the main hospital in Milan. He died in 1824 in his 47th year. Elisabetta Gafforini lived on until 1847 and was survived by their daughter Eugenia. ==Literary works== While still a student at the University of Padua, Gasparinetti's play in free verse, Amore vendicato, was performed at the Teatro Obizzi in Padua in May 1795. Although it was not a particular success with the audiences, it drew favourable notice from the critic of the Gazzetta Urbana Veneta. He also wrote several poems during this time, including a sonnet, Tacea la notte, which was published in a collection marking the marriage of Agostino Nani and Pisana Savorgnan, members of two prominent families in the Veneto. Towards the end of 1795, he published a novella in ottava rima entitled Giannuccio e Cecilia. It recounts the story of two young lovers from noble Neapolitan families who, after many vicissitudes, are finally able to marry. The literary critic Guido Mazzoni noted that despite the fluency of Gasparinetti's verse and its cultured style, Giannuccio e Cecilia was a particularly insipid example of the late 18th- century vogue for \\"naively erotic\\" novellas. Concluding lines of Gasparinetti's 'Apoteosi di Napoleone Primo Imperadore e Re'' Once he began his military career, Gasparinetti's poetry was largely devoted to patriotic republican themes and celebrations of Napoleon's victories. Several of his early poems in this vein were published in a two-volume anthology, Parnasso democratico (\\"Democratic Parnassus\\"). Subtitled Raccolta di poesie repubblicane de' pi√π celebri autori viventi (\\"A collection of republican poetry by the most celebrated living authors\\"), the anthology was published in Bologna in 1801 and contained poetry by Gasparinetti, Giuseppe Giulio Ceroni, Vincenzo Monti, Ugo Foscolo, and a dozen other Italian poets. In 1809, Gasparinetti published Apoteosi di Napoleone Primo Imperadore e Re (\\"Apotheosis of Napoleon First Emperor and King\\"). Consisting of four cantos containing sixty tercets each, the Apoteosi was one of the few Italian poetic works that attempted to chronicle Napoleon's exploits in detail. Its closing lines repeated those spoken by Gasparinetti five years earlier during a mime depicting Napoleon in the Elysian Fields. The mime was enacted at La Scala on 3 June 1804, a national holiday celebrating the newly-created Italian Republic. After his release from prison Gasparinetti completed his five-act tragedy Bibli which he had begun ten years earlier. It was published by Sonzogno in 1819 and dedicated to his wife Elisabetta with an accompanying sonnet entitled A Nabitte (\\"To Nabitte\\", an anagram of her diminutive name, \\"Bettina\\"). Mazzoni described the play, which is based on the Greek myth of Byblis, as carefully versed, at times outstandingly so, and a work that was a credit to the culture and intelligence of its creator but lacking the true force of a tragedy. Mazzoni's views were similar to those expressed by Giovanni Battista De Cristoforis in Il Conciliatore. That same year, the Milanese publisher Niccol√≤ Bettoni announced that he was bringing out a new series of works on Italian history. The first of them was to be Pierre Daru's 7-volume history of the Venetian Republic which had been recently published in Paris. Bettoni had engaged Gasparinetti to translate the work into Italian for the series, but the project was soon aborted by the Austrian authorities. Daru was viewed with great suspicion by the Austrians because of his close ties to Napoleon, his support for democratic ideals, and the praise he had received from the Italian patriot Silvio Pellico. Gasparinetti's last major work was Imelda Lambertazzi, another five-act tragedy. Mindful of the criticisms of Bibli's neoclassical subject, this time Gasparinetti chose a medieval historical theme more in tune with the Romantic movement taking hold in Italian literature. A variation of the story of Romeo and Juliet, the play is based on the real-life figures of Imelda Lambertazzi and Bonifacio Geremei, lovers who belonged to two warring families in 13th-century Bologna‚Äîthe Lambertazzi were Ghibellines while the Geremei were Guelphs. The story has been the subject of several plays written both before and after Gasparinetti's version, as well as Donizetti's opera Imelda de' Lambertazzi. Gasparinetti's version was published in 1821 in a collection of plays selected and annotated by Gaetano Barbieri. Imelda Lambertazzi appeared in Volume 8 of the collection paired with an Italian translation of Casimir Delavigne's five-act comedy Com√©diens. An anonymous review in the journal Biblioteca italiana praised Gasparinetti for tackling the subject and his level of erudition but observed that the over-complexity of the plot at times detracted from the play's impact. In 1831, seven years after Gasparinetti's death and with revolutionary sentiment for a unified Italy in resurgence, three of his poems originally published in Parnasso Democratico thirty years earlier were re-published in Antologia repubblicana (\\"Republican Anthology\\"). ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== *Del Negro, Piero (2007). \\"I percorsi di carriera degli ufficiali: le vite parallele dei veneti Francesco Cortese e Antonio Gasparinetti\\" in Adele Robbiati Bianchi (ed.)

The discovery of gold in California in 1848 brought many German-speaking Jews from Bavaria and the Province of Posen to San Francisco. San Francisco's Jewish population was the second largest Jewish community in the country by 1880. Congregation Sherith Israel was established during the Gold Rush and is one of the oldest synagogues in the United States. The synagogue was the temple of the more old- fashioned Poseners which were less financially successful than the Bavarians. Levi Strauss left New York for San Francisco and supplied miners with sturdy denim pants. In 1853, Levi Strauss & Co. was founded as David Stern & Levi Strauss and located at 90 Sacramento Street close to the docks of San Francisco. The world-renowned blue jeans were invented by Jacob W. Davis and Levi Strauss, who patented their design in 1873. Adolph Sutro was the first Jewish mayor of San Francisco from 1895 until 1897.

The resulting publication, The Stranger, began publishing in September 1991. In the early 2000s he sold a minority of the paper to the Chicago Reader and founded the Portland Mercury, operating the two papers as Index Newspapers, LLC. In 2018 Keck stepped down as publisher of The Stranger, while continuing as president of Index Newspapers. ===Political views=== As of 2011, according to The Seattle Times, Keck was \\"largely unknown in Seattle\\". However, during the 2009 mayoral campaign of Mike McGinn, Keck directed The Stranger to \\"turn up the dial as high as we could\\" becoming, according to The Seattle Times, \\"a de facto arm of the McGinn campaign\\". The newspaper's endorsement was given to McGinn in a 6,000-word front-page treatment, while news coverage of McGinn's opponent Joe Mallahan used profanities to describe him. Keck, who has rarely given political donations, provided monetary support to the McGinn campaign and attended McGinn's election night victory party. Keck also donated $250 in 2004 to the presidential campaign of John Kerry and $250 the following year to the senatorial campaign of Maria Cantwell. ==Personal life== According to Keck, he suffers from dyslexia, somnambulism, and is a recreational user of marijuana. Keck has two children with a woman described in different sources as either a spouse or girlfriend. ==References== ==External links== * Seattle Voices with Tim Keck (interview) * Twitter account Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:University of Wisconsin-Madison alumni Category:American newspaper publishers (people) ","title":"Tim Keck"},{"id":"63932036","text":"Otto in 2013 Waldemar Otto (30 March 1929 ‚Äì 8 May 2020) was a Polish-born German sculptor. == Biography == Otto was born in Petrikau, Poland and fled in 1945 with his parents to Halle (Saale) in Germany.

His family then moved to Gorky (Nizhny Novgorod) in Russia. He studied physics at Moscow University and at the University of Gorky, graduating in 1952. In 1961 Tavger began underground Zionist activities, organizing a group of students who studied Zeev Jabotinsky's books and articles and prepared for immigration to Israel. In 1968, Tavger was expelled from the University of Gorky and deprived of teaching privileges throughout the region. He was subsequently accepted as a senior researcher at the Rzhanov Institute of Semiconductor Physics in Novosibirsk. Here he again led a group of young Zionists. ==Immigration to Israel== In May 1972, Tavger immigrated to Israel, arriving at Nazareth Illit absorption center. Yuval Ne'eman, then president of Tel Aviv University, invited to work at the university. Tavger worked at Tel Aviv University until 1974, at the same time trying to set up a science and research institute located in Kiryat Arba, near Hebron. ==Hebron== In 1974, Tavger left Tel Aviv University and moved to Kiryat Arba. Soon he began to take part in the restoration efforts of historic sites in nearby Hebron. In 1975, a four-month-old baby, Avraham Nachson, who had died of Sudden infant death syndrome, was buried in the old Jewish cemetery in Hebron. Residents of Kiryat Arba began to arrange guard duty at the grave due to frequent vandalizing and Tavger volunteered. He began cleaning and restoring the cemetery and the nearby Tomb of Jesse and Ruth. Tavger was involved in identifying Jewish sites in Hebron destroyed during the Jordanian era, such as cleaning and excavation at the site of the Avraham Avinu Synagogue which had been torn down and its remains used as an animal pen for sheep and goats. ==Later years== From 1975, Tavger taught at the Jerusalem College of Technology, where he established a laboratory with Naftali Eisenberg. Tavger died on July 22, 1983 and is survived by a wife and five sons. The area next to the Avraham Avinu Synagogue in Hebron is called \\"Kiryat Ben-Zion\\" in his memory. The street leading to the synagogue was also named after him. ==Scientific publicationsMagnetic symmetry=== *B. Tavger and V.

It seems that Hogg wrote them in 1833, envisaging that they would appear in London under the imprint of James Fraser, who published Fraser's Magazine from its foundation in 1830. After Hogg had parted company with William Blackwood at the end of 1831 Fraser's provided a welcome home for his short prose works and single poems, replacing Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine. Hogg also had a difference of opinion with Fraser in the later part of 1833, but they settled their disagreement in November, and it must have been either in the first part of the year or at the end that he sent Fraser the Lay Sermons.James Hogg, Lay Sermons, ed. Gillian Hughes (Edinburgh, 1997), xiii‚Äíxv. On 25 January 1834 Hogg noted that the work was in the press.The Collected Letters of James Hogg: Volume 3 1832 to 1835, ed.

Ernestine Hill called Irvine a \\"hero of the north\\". == Early life == Irvine was born 12 January 1890, the youngest of 12 children to Scottish immigrants John and Margaret Irvine in Boucaut, South Australia. Irvine started work at a young age, when he was only 14, and worked on various cattle stations and wool sheds in the area. At 22 Irvine married Mary Farrell, at St Ignatius Church in Norwood, who he met when working at Coonamoon Station; their wedding was held in the vestry of the church as Irvine was not a Roman Catholic like Mary. The couple would go on to have 4 children; Margaret, Jean, Donald and Kathleen. In 1919, for the education of their children, the family moved to Adelaide and, unable to find work, Irvine took on the mail contract between Kingoonya and Coober Pedy in 1920 (a distance of 218.63 km or 135.85 miles). Irvine was the first contractor on this mail run to motorise the mail service, which had previously being done using camel train or pack horse, and, in doing so, had to make his own road and even cut the last 96 km or 60 miles through the opal fields. He created many of these roads by dragging a log or steel bar behind his truck. Irvine also had to carry a significant collection of spare parts as there were no mechanics or service stations to help and few people had his mechanical knowledge. This separation from his family, differences in religion, loneliness in the work he was doing and other personal problems contributed to his relationship with his wife breaking down. == Life in the Northern Territory == From 1925 to 1929 Irvine moved on to the Oodnadatta to Alice Springs mail run (a distance of 665 km or 413 miles) and, on this run, he had to use both his truck and camels to complete the very sandy run. Irvine also held the contract for the shorter run between Alice Springs and Arltunga (which he kept until 1932). After the railway was completed in 1929 his mail run was completed by the train so Irvine took on the Alice Springs to Tennant Creek mail contract and began carrying passengers also; which was later extended to include Newcastle Waters and Birdum (Larrimah). It was during this time that Irvine became a well known identity in Central Australia, described a broad-shouldered and ever-smiling, and \\"Territorians knew that if it was humanly possible to get the mail through on time, even on occasion with four bare rims, Sam Irvine did it\\". Australian author Ernestine Hill travelled from Alice Springs to Birdum with Irvine in 1932, a journey which took 17 days, and published her article \\"Racing in the Rain in the Heart of Australia\\" in The Advertiser (Adelaide) which was published 29 April 1933. In this article she described Irvine as: Another famous passenger that Irvine travelled with was Olive Pink, a botanical illustrator and anthropologist with an eccentric reputation. According to Reg Harris Pink advised Irvine that she had a loaded revolver under her pillow and that he should keep his distance and that Irvine replied \\"with a face like that you don't need a revolver.\\" In December 1937 Irvine injured himself when lifting a heavy drum of petrol and was replaced by Kurt Johannsen.

It is a Grade II listed building. ==History== In the late 1850s the Vestry Board of St Mary, Newington met in the Infant School Room in Queen's Head Row as well as in a room in the local parish church. After civic leaders found this arrangement was inadequate, they decided to procure a purpose-built vestry hall: the site selected on Walworth Road had previously been open land owned by the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers. The new building, which was designed by Henry Jarvis in the Italianate style and built Piper and Wheeler, was officially opened on 8 August 1865. The building was financed by a loan from Edward Chambers Nicholson, a wealthy chemist who had settled locally in his retirement. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with seven bays facing onto Walworth Road; the central section featured a round-arched stone doorway flanked by Corinthian order columns; there was a triple round- arched window above on the first floor. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber on the first floor. After the Newington Public Library had been built to the south east of the town hall in 1892, an infill extension was added between the two buildings in 1893. The town hall became the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark and was renamed \\"Southwark Town Hall\\" in 1900. It was extended along Wansey street to provide further accommodation in 1902. The building ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged London Borough of Southwark was formed in 1965. It was subsequently used as workspace by the council, becoming known as \\"Walworth Town Hall\\", and was also used as the local registrar's office. The Cuming Museum, which had been based at the back of the Newington Public Library, moved into the town hall in 2006. The roof of the building was badly damaged by a fire in March 2013 and the building was subsequently added to the Heritage at Risk Register. In March 2018, the council announced that the building would be restored and appointed Feix & Merlin as architects and General Projects as the developer for works. Proposals for the restoration works, which included educational activities, creative workshops and studio spaces, were submitted for planning consent in June 2020. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Southwark Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1865 Category:Grade II listed government buildings ","title":"Walworth Town Hall"},{"id":"63933179","text":"Yeung ancestral hall in Yeung Uk Tsuen Yeung Uk Tsuen () is a village in Shap Pat Heung, Yuen Long District, Hong Kong. ==External links== * Delineation of area of existing village Yeung Uk Tsuen (Shap Pat Heung) for election of resident representative (2019 to 2022) Category:Populated places in Hong Kong Category:Shap Pat Heung ","title":"Yeung Uk Tsuen, Shap Pat Heung"},{"id":"63933191","text":"Giuseppina \\"Giusy\\" Versace (born 20 May 1977) is an Italian Paralympic athlete who competes in sprinting events in international level events and a television presenter and politician for the Forza Italia party in 2018. ==Personal life== Versace is the daughter of Alfredo Versace and cousin to fashion designers Gianni Versace, Donatella Versace and Santo Versace through her father's side.

The son of Samuel Greenlees, he was born in December 1882 at Islington. He was educated at Harrow School, before going up to Magdalen College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford in 1904, Greenlees made two appearances in first-class cricket. The first came for London County against Leicestershire at Leicester, with his second appearance coming for Oxford University in a trial match against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. After graduating from Oxford, he entered into the family Scotch whiskey distilling business. Greenlees was the Conservative candidate for Whitechapel in the January 1910 general election, finishing second to the Liberal Party candidate Stuart Samuel. Owing to his Scottish parentage, he enlisted as a second lieutenant in the Scottish Horse Yeomanary in November 1911. Weeks prior to the start of the First World War in July 1914, Greenlees was promoted to lieutenant and served in the conflict. He was made a temporary captain in October 1915, with him transferring to the Scots Guards in October 1916. Following the war, he was appointed a court- martial officer in December 1918. In the same month he was made a temporary major, which he relinquished in April 1920 and returned to the rank of lieutenant. In the same month he resigned his commission, upon which he was granted the rank of major.

Wakeling (1923-2016) was the recipient of the Optical Society of America (OSA) Stephen D. Fantone Distinguished Service Award in 1990 and Managing Editor of the scientific journal Applied Optics for three decades. Wakefield was integral in the launch of OSA's first two journals. == Early Life and Career == Patricia \\"Paddy\\" Wakeling was born and raised in London. She received an undergraduate degree in chemistry and worked at the Office of Naval Research shortly after. Wakeling then spent several years at Pergamon Press where she learnt how to launch scientific journals. In 1959 Wakeling joined the Optical Society of America to serve as the Assistant Secretary. Wakeling was recommended to Walter Baird, the then chairman of OSA, having known her work in the New York office of Pergamon Press and had heard that she was not completely happy with the company. In the Reminiscences of Bruce Billings, OSA's president in 1971, Billings comments on his introduction to Wakeling in 1949, mediated by the director of the London Office of Naval Research as Wakeling was helping to produce the their newsletter. Billings would then visit Wakeling regularly upon his trips to London where he learnt about Wakeling's work at Pergamon. Soon after, Wakeling, still in London, received a call from OSA Executive Secretary Mary Warga to discuss her subsequent appointment at OSA; at that time, international calls were rare. Upon joining OSA Wakeling would work on the first floor of the newly completed building belonging to the American Chemical Society. She aided the development of the translation journal Optics and Spectroscopy through her grant from the National Science Foundation. This journal was based on maintaining a translation of the Russian journal Optika i Spektroskopiya and required Wakeling to write to the Soviet Academy of Sciences for their permission and cooperation. At the time, it was a direct reaction to fears that Russian science had progressed further than American technology, yet these achievements were only reported in Soviet science journals, of which few American scientists could read. Wakeling kept a blackboard listing each article and which translators were responsible for translating, and whether they were late to deliver; the process was described as \\"whips cracked, and translators cowered\\" enabling Optics and Spectroscopy to deliver their issues only three to six months later than the Soviet original. Wakeling would subsequently receive another fund from the National Science Foundation to start up OSA's second journal Applied Optics in collaboration with editor John N. Howard. The first issue of Applied Optics was released in January 1962, having had 15 months of planning, with Wakeling as Managing Editor, then as Editorial consultant. She was keen for a \\"splashy cover (not like Newton's old diagram of a prism found on the front of JOSA)\\". Howard would later remark that during this period \\"we were, a happy chaos of scientific family: authors, editor, feature editors, columnists, referees, reporters, reviewers, copy editors, indexer and printer; each doing his own thing rather like a symphony orchestra performing Charles Ives or Stockhausen, but under the baton and watchful eye of our musical director and materfamilias Paddy Wakeling\\". In the 1960s, the OSA Board considered the activities of Applied Optics as overwhelming for the OSA Executive Office, which was seeking to expand efforts in education. To this end, Wakeling left the OSA office and incorporated as WINC (Wakeling, Inc) who were contracted to perform the editorial mechanics such as page proofing and scheduling. in 1990 the Optical Society of America presented Wakeling with the Stephen D. Fantone Distinguished Service Award for her service to the community. During her 30 year career with OSA, she held several positions in the Executive Office. On April 1st 1991 Wakeling retired as Managing Editor of Applied Optics whilst continuing to serve as Contributing Editor. Wakeling maintained ties with the Washington science and policy scene as many government agencies and scientific societies are based there. In John Howard's article for Wakeling's retirement, he remarked \\"It is hard to believe, but even Paddy Wakeling seems to be mortal\\". As part of her Contributing Editor duties at Applied Optics, between 1991-1993 Wakeling would regularly compile the NASA Patter, a summary of interesting developments relevant for opticists compiled from NASA Tech Briefs. Wakeling donated a painting sometime between 1960-1970 titled Ghost Horse made by Woody Crumbo, a Potawatomi artist, to the National Museum of the American Indian. She had inherited the painting from Mathew Kent Wilson. In her memoriam, Wakeling was said to be remembered \\"for her enthusiasm, relentless pursuit of perfection, and ability to speak her mind, sparing no one - be it of colleagues, friends, subordinates, or authority figures.\\" == Death == On 21 September 2016, Wakeling died. == References == Category:American editors Category:Academic journal editors Category:American women editors Category:The Optical Society Category:Women in optics ","title":"Patricia Wakeling"},{"id":"63933490","text":"The Blackmer RMS detector is an electronic true RMS converter invented by David E. Blackmer in 1971. The Blackmer detector, coupled with the Blackmer gain cell, forms the core of the dbx noise reduction system and various professional audio signal processors developed by dbx, Inc. Unlike earlier RMS detectors that time-averaged algebraic square of input signal, the Blackmer detector performs time-averaging on the logarithm of the input, being the first successful, commercialized instance of log-domain filter. The circuit, created by trial and error, computes root mean squared of various waveforms with high precision, although exact nature of its operation was not known to the inventor. First mathematical analysis of log-domain filtering and mathematical proof of Blackmer's invention were proposed by Robert Adams in 1979; general log-domain filter synthesis theory was developed by Douglas Frey in 1993. == Operation == Development path from traditional log-antilog RMS detector (top) to the Blackmer RMS detector (bottom) in its patented 1971 configuration. Diode symbols denote denote diode-connected transistors; diodes proper have inferior logarithming characteristics and are avoided in precision circuits. Root mean square (RMS), defined as the square root of the mean square of input signal over time, is a useful metric of alternating currents. Unlike peak value or average value, RMS is directly related to energy, being equivalent to the direct current that would be required to get the same heating effect. In audio applications, RMS is the only metric directly related to perceived loudness, being insensitive to the phase of harmonics in complex waveforms. Magnetic recording and playback inevitably shifts phases of harmonics; a true RMS converter will not react to such phase shift. Simpler peak detectors or average detectors, on the contrary, respond to changes in phase with changing output values, although energy level and loudness remain unchanged. For this reason David Blackmer, designer of dbx noise reduction system, needed a cost-efficient precision RMS detector compatible with the Blackmer gain cell. The latter had an exponential control characteristic, so a suitable detector had to have logarithmic output. Contemporary electronic RMS detectors had \\"normal\\", linear outputs, and were built exactly following the definition of RMS. The detector would compute square of the input signal, time-average the square using a low-pass filter or an integrator, and then compute square root of that average to produce linear, not logarithmic, output. Analog computation of squares and square roots was performed using either expensive variable-transconductance analog multipliers (which remain expensive in the 21st century) or simpler and cheaper logarithmic converters employing exponential current-voltage characteristic of a bipolar transistor. Thermal RMS conversion was too slow for audio purposes; electronic RMS detectors worked fine in measurement instruments, but their dynamic range was too narrow for professional audio - precisely because they operated on squares of input signal, taking up twice its dynamic range. Blackmer reasoned that the log-antilog detector may be simplified by taking up processing to log domain, omitting physical squaring of input signals and thus retaining its full dynamic range. Squaring and taking square roots in log domain is very cheap, being simple scaling by a factor of 2 or 1/2. However, simple linear filters do not work in log domain, producing incorrect, irrelevant output. Correct time-averaging required nonlinear filters of yet unknown topology. Blackmer proposed simple replacement of a resistor in RC network with a silicon diode biased with a fixed idle current. Since small-signal impedance of such diode is controlled linearly by current, changing this current controls settling time of the detector. Cutoff frequency of this first order filter equals :f_c = \\\\frac { 1 } { 2 \\\\pi } ( \\\\frac { I_{idle} } { \\\\phi_t C } ), where \\\\phi_t is thermal voltage (hence the frequency shifts with temperature). The equation is valid for a range of idle currents over , allowing wide tuning opportunity. The circuit has fast attack and slow decay, which are locked to each other and cannot be adjusted separately. Logarithmic output voltage is proportional to the mean of the square at a rate of around 3 mV/dB, and proportional to RMS at around 6 mV/dB. When the crude test circuit was built, Blackmer and his associates did not expect it to work as a true RMS detector, but it did. According to Robert Adams, it \\"seemed to behave ideally\\", and rigorous tests with various waveforms confirmed ideal RMS performance. The circuit was absolutely insensitive to phase shifts in input signal. It was immediately patented and employed in dbx, Inc. professional audio processors. No one in the company, including Blackmer, could explain why it works at all until 1977, when Robert Adams began work on proper mathematical proof of RMS compliance. Adams tried to extend log-domain concept to Sallen‚ÄìKey topology and failed. He published his thesis in 1979, and was later credited as the inventor of log- domain filter concept, but the idea remained unknown to general public until the 1993 pioneering work by Douglas Frey. == References  Bibliography === * * * Category:Analog circuits Category:Dynamics processing Category:Measuring instruments Category:American inventions Category:20th- century inventions Category:1970s in technology ","title":"Blackmer RMS detector"},{"id":"63933499","text":"Debbie Pain is a conservation biologist and ecotoxicologist working on endangered birds around the world. Since 1988 she has led projects into reversing the decline in several species through research, practical and policy measures at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Wildlife and Wetlands Trust. ==Scientific career== Pain worked from 1988 on ecotoxicology at Station Biologique de la Tour du Valat in the Camargue, France, and from 1992 was employed in the research department of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. She initiated and led the international research section. In 2008 she became Director of Conservation for the Wildlife and Wetlands Trust, leaving in 2018. She has been an Honorary Research Fellow in the Department of Zoology at Cambridge University since 2018 and an Honorary Professor in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of East Anglia since 2019. While with the RSPB she was their first international research biologist and then formed and managed an international research team that collaborated within BirdLife. She led projects in the early 2000s into causes of decline in the numbers of white-backed and indian vultures in India. She also led research into the effects of agriculture on birds, the value of islands that can be cleared of predators and the consequences for birds of climate change. During her time with the WWT she increased its role in international conservation. This included multinational programmes for recovery of the critically endangered spoon-billed sandpiper and the madagascar pochard. She also continued her research and policy work to reduce lead poisoning of wild birds from ammunition sources. The use of lead shot over wetlands and SSSIs in the countries of UK has been legally restricted from 1999 onwards and this has led to a voluntary transition to lead-free shot for live quarry shooting in the UK by 2025. ==Awards== In 2013 she received the Marsh Award for Conservation Biology from the Zoological Society of London. In 2015 Pain was included as one of the 50 most influential conservation heroes in the Wildlife Power List of the BBC Wildlife Magazine. ==Education and early life== Pain became keen on birds at the age of seven, inspired by a teacher while at junior school in her home town of Ramsgate. She was first in her family to go to university and studied environmental chemistry at Wye College, University of London followed by research into the biochemistry of lead poisoning from ammunition sources in birds during her doctorate at Oxford University. ==Publications== Pain is the author or co- author of over 115 scientific publications, including 3 books.

She came to wider prominence as the wife of the celebrity-conductor Herbert von Karajan whom she married in October 1958. As a widow she remained in the public eye through her promotion of her late husband's abundant artistic legacy and as a patron of the arts more broadly, partly through the establishment of several generously endowed artistic foundations and institutes and partly through her on-going involvement, till 2020, as hands-on honorary president of the Salzburg Easter Festival. ==LifeProvenance and early years=== Eliette Mouret was born at Mollans-sur-Ouv√®ze, a little hill-town behind Avignon where her parents owned a holiday home. They were both teachers. There was a sister who was twenty years her senior: she was still very small when her father died. She later told an interviewer that her mother \\"was a teacher with a passion for playing the piano, but no time for me. I ended up with a 'foster mother'\\". She attended a boarding school run by nuns, and grew up in Nice. ===Karajan=== She was \\"discovered\\" by Christian Dior when she was 18. Mouriet worked for Dior as a long legged photo-model, showing off wedding dresses and other high-class outfits in Europe's competing \\"fashion capitals\\". At some point during the early 1950s she first met Herbert von Karajan on a friend's yacht at St. Tropez. Eliette von Karajan: Mein Leben an seiner Seite. Ullstein Verlag, Berlin 2008, p. 10. She was reportedly seventeen at the time, though according to one jaded - albeit self-evidently numerate and eminently \\"serious\\" - biographer, \\"like many very beautiful women ..... [she] was seventeen for an awfully long time\\". Being at sea often made her sick: on this occasion it was the smell of frying fish that set her off, and she had to be escorted ashore: Herbert von Karajan volunteered for the task. In 1955 they met up again in London, by which time she had become obsessed with the maestro, During the early 1950s she accompanied him as his \\"girl friend\\" on visits to the island of Ischia where they would meet up with fellow musicians (and others) including William Walton and his garrulous wife. Lady Walton later recalled that Eliette \\"was always seasick\\", when taken sailing before breakfast, but \\"never complained\\". Another of Lady Walton's more striking vignettes from those visits to the Bay of Naples featured Karajan and girlfriend sharing a Vespa, with Eliette sitting side saddle on the back as they scootered back and forth across the island. Hebert and Anita von Karajan were divorced in 1958: he and Eliette Mouret then married at Meg√®ve on 6 October 1958. The life of a fashion model was exchanged for that of a \\"jet set wife\\" and, a few years later, mother. She was the third of Karajan's three wives: they would remain married for 31 years. Later still she would tell an interviewer that the first present she received from her husband was a pair of hiking boots. The couple's elder daughter, Isabel, was born on 25 June 1960 in Vienna. Eliette would explain that the name \\"Isabel\\" was in honour of a favourite hotel on Ischia. Isabel Karajan has subsequently achieved notability as an actress. The Karajans' younger daughter was born at Samaden on 2 January 1964. This time a more overtly musical connection is cited: Arabel received her name as a tribute to the not quite eponymous sugar-coated Strauss opera Arabella. Many children are provided with Godparent's at or shortly after birth. The \\"Godparents\\" assigned to Isabel and Arabel Karajan were respectively the Vienna Philharmonic and Berlin Philharmonic orchestras. ===Working marriage=== Over the next three decades Eliette von Karajan accompanied her husband \\"everywhere\\", matching his formidable programme of travel and performances with her own remarkable blend of patience, devotion and commitment, moving among his fans and admirers and attempting to shield him, as far as possible, from some of the more oppressive aspects of the celebrity which he courted and craved. Through it all, unbreakable iron discipline and bottomless energy were vital elements in the life they shared. Karajan also very much valued her musical judgment precisely because she was neither a trained musician nor a professional musicologist: as a \\"mere music lover\\" he knew that she was more representative of concert goers and record buyers than any pundit or professional rival. She alone sat with him through the agonisingly tense waits behind the curtain, as he studied a score and arranged for her to have a foot massage, before he headed out towards the podium and she, as decorously as possible, rushed to take her place, habitually placed in the front row of the audience. A pattern was quickly established, and then, as the Karajan era reached a third decade, one or two less charitable commentators emerged to imply that an element of careful choreography in the way the Karajans presented a public face of their intense partnership. Between concerts she would quietly sit in on orchestral rehearsals for hours on end. The life they led meant that Karajans became were part of a network of cerebral artist-celebrities with a taste for the high- life. Carefully honed media presentation came with the territory. Friends included Jean Cocteau, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Henri-Georges Clouzot, Helmut Schmidt, Marc Chagall, and the actress Romy Schneider, with whom Eliette liked to \\"flirt\\", although relations cooled a little after Schnieder, while staying as a house-guest, used a lipstick to scrawl graffiti all over the large mirror in the bathroom: \\"very awkward for my staff\\", Eliette later recalled. Much of the couple's married life was spent travelling in connection with Herbert von Karajan's work. From around 1961, when they did come home, it was to St. Moritz (in Winter), St. Tropez (in Summer) or Karajan's small estate at Anif, on the southern edge of Salzburg (especially during the festival). In each of these municipalities they lived in some style, supported by staffs of domestic servants. Since she was widowed in 1989 the pace of the travelling has become very much less frenetic, and Eliette von Karajan has for the most part simply alternative between living at the homes the couple had shared at St. Tropez and Anif. ===Painting=== While still working as a professional fashion model Eliette Mouret enrolled briefly at an art academy in London. Professional pressures, followed by a full-time marriage accompanied by motherhood, meant that she never finished the course. After a visit to the \\"Visuals Academy\\" (\\" Internationale Sommer Akademie f√ºr Bildenden K√ºnste\\") set up in Switzerland by Oskar Kokoschka she returned to her art, however. She was supported by several \\"famous name artists\\" of the time who were also friends. These included \\"late surrealists\\" such as Ernst Fuchs, J√∂rg Immendorff and Marc Chagall whom she visited frequently at his home in Saint-Paul-de-Vence. Her teacher, the painter Herbert Breiter, was also a very important artistic influence. Her husband was particularly enthusiastic about Eliette's emergence as an artist. Till 1982 Eliette's art remained an entirely private passion. Then a series of her paintings were featured on record sleeves (with more in a separate accompanying supplement) for a special anniversary collection of Karajan recordings issued to celebrate the centenary of the Berlin Philharmonic orchestras (of which Herbert von Karajan had been principal conductor since 1956). The entire set, which had originally comprised 50 LP discs, was re- issued on 5 April 1988 as a set of 25 CDs to mark von Karajan's eightieth birthday. ===Widow and benefactress=== Herbert von Karajan suffered what turned out to be his fatal heart attack on 15 July 1989 and died the next day. While he was alive the management of his media image had been an important skill, and following his death employed Eliette adeptly applied \\"secrecy and speed\\" in order to ensure that, on this occasion, his funeral did not become a press spectacle. Only around ten people knew of the arrangements for the private funeral ceremony in the little cemetery at Anif. As matters turned out, the burial was delayed for several hours after a large long forgotten stone plinth was found a few centimeters under the surface at the position agreed, many years before, as the maestro's last resting place. Everything ground to a halt while a farmer was found to use a heavy tractor with lifting tackle to drag the subterranean impediment away. It was dark by the time the body of Herbert von Karajan could be buried, but the entire ceremony nevertheless remained a private family matter. It was at the widow's instigation that in 1995 the \\"Herbert von Karajan Center\\" was set up in Vienna, across the road from the \\"Staatsoper\\". It accommodated a comprehensive archive of Herbert von Karajan's many audio and video recordings. The centre closed in 2006. As usual with the Karajans. the press were there to ask questions: Eliette was, it seemed, disappointed that it had become necessary to turn the front of the Karajan Center into a tacky souvenir shop. It was no coincidence that the closure of the Karajan Center opposite the Vienna's principal Opera House followed shortly after the opening, in December 2005, of the Eliette and Herbert von Karajan Institute. Michael Dewitte, the director of the Salzburg Easter Festival, was appointed Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer (loosely, \\"CEO\\") of the institute, into which the Vienna-based Karajan Center's surviving activities were to be incorporated. It was explained that the institute, for which an annual budget of ‚Ç¨1.5 million had been set aside, would co-ordinate concert planning in connection with the forthcoming centenary, in 2008, of Herbert von Karajan's birth. It was located not, as might have been expected, in Vienna, but in Salzburg, emphasizing the Karajans' close artistic and personal connections with that city. In the longer term, the ambition was for the institute to celebrate and to make more widely known the maestro's exceptional achievements, along with the associated elements of his character, both as interpreter and artist, and as promoter of talent and excellence, educator and entrepreneur-artist. Activities of the institute would involve organising symposia and exhibitions. Continuing skilful media engagement were also central to the project. Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer Dewitte stressed the importance attached to the \\"Nachhaltigkeit\\" (loosely, \\"sustainability\\") of the project. In practical terms this has been expressed through a particular emphasis in discovering and supporting younger musicians and other artists. Eliette also turned her formidable energies to supporting a new generation of artists in their work. One manifestation of this was the \\"Eliette von Karajan-Kulturfonds\\" (\\"Eliette von Karajan Culture Fund\\") launched in 2001, which made available annually, initially for a term of five years, at least 100,000 US dollars or 150,000 Swiss francs to support cultural initiatives and activities in the Canton of Graub√ºnden, where the family had made a ski-season home together at St. Moritz since 1961. Characteristically, the allocation of grants was to be prioritized according to certain carefully thought through and specified criteria such as \\"internationality\\", \\"reflection of contemporary culture\\", \\"involvement or benefit of/for young people\\" and \\"cultural or inspirational usefulness to the canton or individual regions within the canton\\". Early award winners included a young violinist/composer, a young clarinettist, a young author of film and theatre texts, and a youthful theatre director. The unifying theme was the exceptional level of talent and early achievement already demonstrated by each of the recipients. Former award recipients who have already built significant reputations include the recorder player and conductor Maurice Steger, the mezzo-soprano Maria Riccarda Wesseling and the theatre director Felix Benesch. Another major initiative was the \\"Prix Eliette von Karajan\\", reflecting her own commitment to painting. High-profile recipients include the English artist-entrepreneur Damien Hirst in 1995, the sculptress Rachel Whiteread in 1996, the German artist Helmut Dorner in 1997 and the Graub√ºnden singer-lyricist Corin Curschellas in 2003. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1931 births Category:Living people Category:People from Nice Category:People from Salzburg Category:French female models Category:Herbert von Karajan Category:German patrons of the arts Category:German biographers Category:German women biographers Category:Salzburg Festival ","title":"Eliette von Karajan"},{"id":"63933509","text":"Shing Uk Tsuen village entrance.

The Insurrection of 1847 in the Two Sicilies is a series of three revolts that happened in September 1847 in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Its aim was the unification of Italy and the establishment of either a constitutional monarchy or a republic. The insurrection is often considered as a continuation of the Neapolitan revolution of 1820 and at the same time as a foretaste of the Sicilian revolution of 1848 and of the spring of nations. == The three revolts == The uprising of 1847 started to be planned since 1843 within a network of liberal and carbonari committees that used to meet secretly in Naples, at the time the capital of the kingdom. One of the leaders of these committees was for instance the poet and activist Carlo Poerio. The insurrection had been initially planned for the end of 1844, but this was disrupted by the unexpected failed attempt of the Bandiera brothers to take over Calabria. Finally, after long negotiations and the gathering of weapons and powder, it was eventually decided that three simultaneous uprisings would take place: one in Sicily, more precisely in Messina, and two in the southern part of Calabria, in Reggio Calabria and in the district of Gerace. The plan was that the rebels would then move toward the North to liberate Palmi, Catanzaro, Cosenza and eventually Naples. The revolt of Messina was the first to explode, on the 1st of September, but was crushed the same day by the local military authorities, and most of the leaders of the revolt, including the historian Carlo Gemelli, fled to Malta. The revolt however expanded in the following days to neighboring rural villages in the mountains, such as in Novara di Sicilia, although without much success. On the 2nd of September, the following day of the Messina revolts, uprisings also broke out in Reggio Calabria and in the district of Gerace. The Reggio revolt started in the village of Santo Stefano in Aspromonte, from which 500 men led by Domenico Romeo (1796-1847) then marched on the city of Reggio Calabria and established a provisional government. On the 3rd of September, the rebels took over the Reggio castle as well as the prison of San Francesco, and instituted an 'insurrectional junta'. Learning about the insurrection, the King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies sent two warships which arrived at Reggio on the 4th and started bombing the city. The repression was terrible and four leaders of the rebellion were shot while Domenico Romeo was captured and then beheaded. Finally, the revolt in the district of Gerace, which started at the same time as the Reggio revolt, lasted until the 6th of September with the main leaders being captured only on the 15th. Starting in the villages of Sant'Agata del Bianco and Bianco, the insurgents then marched on Caraffa del Bianco, Bovalino, Ardore, Siderno, Gioiosa Ionica and Roccella Ionica, covering a distance of more than 45 kilometers. In each of these towns, they proclaimed the suppression of the taxes on imports and exports, and the reduction by half of the costs of salt and tobacco. They also captured the Intendant of the district of Gerace, Antonio Bonafede, a known reactionary. However, on the 6th of September, due to the arrival of a warship and to the notice of the imminent arrival of Royal military troops directed by general Ferdinando Nunziante, the insurgents disbanded and the leaders of the revolt fled northward to the mountains, hiding in a cave in the valley of Caulonia. On the 15th of September, they were eventually denounced by a local peasant called Nicola Ciccarello and captured by the authorities. The five main leaders of the Gerace revolt, Rocco Verduci, Michele Bello, Pietro Mazzoni, Gaetano Ruffo and Domenico Salvadori, were therefore arrested and after a trial they were executed in Gerace on the 2nd of October 1847. They are today remembered as the Five Martyrs of Gerace (in Italian: Cinque Martiri di Gerace). == Notable people involved == * Carlo Poerio (1803-1867) * Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies (1810-1859) * Domenico Romeo (1796-1847) * The Five Martyrs of Gerace: Rocco Verduci (1824-1847), Michele Bello (1822-1847), Pietro Mazzoni (1822-1847), Gaetano Ruffo (1819-1847) and Domenico Salvadori (1822-1847). == References == * Cataldo, Vincenzo (2000) Cospirazioni, Economia e Societ√† nel Distretto di Gerace dal 1847 all'Unit√† d'Italia, Arti Grafiche. * Fava, Francesco (1906) Il moto calabrese del 1847, F.

It has been made in regions of the island for thousands of years. The Irish language term for cider is leann √∫ll (literally \\"apple beer\\") or ceirtl√≠s, derived from ceirt, an Old Irish term for an apple tree (cf. the Ogham letter ceirt ·öä).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LieQ68csQ0&feature;=youtu.be ==History== Apples have been eaten in Ireland since 3000 BC, with pips of Malus sylvestris (European crab apple) found on a site in County Meath. The law tract Boetha Comaithchesa of the 7th/8th centuries AD distinguish between wild and cultivated apple trees, indicating that apples were being cultivated at the time. Traditional regions of production were the counties of Armagh, Kilkenny, Tipperary and Waterford; it was made by monks in Ireland's many Christian monasteries. The first definite mention of cider in an Irish text is in a 12th century document from Ulster; in 1155, a Mac Cana chieftain was praised for the quality of his cider. Civil Surveys of the 1650s contain numerous entries regarding orchards and cidermaking. Cider production was a major industry from the 16th century onward, with immigration from Huguenots and the Palatine region bringing cider-making skills to Ireland. Richard Pococke toured Ireland in 1752, noting that Affane, County Waterford was famous for its cider, and that Shannon Grove near Pallaskenry had a cider house. Cider making went into decline at the time of the Great Famine (1845‚Äì49). Government efforts produced a revival in the late 19th century, but the industry was hit hard again by the world wars. William Magner opened his brewery in Clonmel in 1935, producing cider on an industrial scale. Magners rebranded cider for young people in the early 21st century, to some success. ==Present day== Dabinett apple Today, cider accounts for 7.5% of alcohol consumed in Ireland; the Republic of Ireland consumes 64 million litres a year (about 13 litres or 23 pints per person), three-quarters of it of Irish origin. Craft cider is increasing in popularity. Cider makers complain that they are held back by high excise duty on ciders stronger than 6% ABV. There are 45 commercial apple growers in Ireland, with 29% of the planting area going into cider. The Dabinett is the most common cultivar. ==See also== *Cider *Cider in the United Kingdom ==References== Category:Cider Category:Irish ciders ","title":"Cider in Ireland"},{"id":"63933549","text":"Panwali Dwar is a mountain of the Garhwal Himalaya in Uttarakhand India.The elevation of Panwali Dwar is and its prominence is .

Chiarella grew up in Sydney, Australia and trained in musical theatre at the Victorian College of the Arts. ==WritingDreamSong=== While at university at the VCA, Chiarella began collaborating with fellow student, Robert Tripolino, on the musical DreamSong. He wrote the book and lyrics and Tripolino composed the music. DreamSong is a musical satire about an evangelical megachurch that stage the second coming of Christ and market him as a Christian pop star. Meanwhile, the actual second coming of Christ occurs. The VCA agreed to support the development of the musical and staged a full production in 2011 directed by Michael Gurr. The show was selected as part of the Carnegie 19 New Music Theatre programme at Arts Centre Melbourne, where the show went through an workshop followed by a four night showcase featuring John O'May, Sheridan Harbridge, Nick Christo, Sam Ludeman, Stefanie Jones, Nelson Gardner, Briallen Clarke and Simon Wilton, once again directed by Michael Gurr. DreamSong then received a full production at Theatre Works in 2014 directed by Dean Bryant and starring Ben Prendergast, Chelsea Gibb, Brent Hill, Connor Crawford, Emily Langridge, Mike McLeish, Alana Tranter and Evan Lever as part of the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. Despite its controversial subject matter, the show received mostly positive reviews. Cameron Woodhead wrote in The Age, \\"Viable new musicals don't come along every day. Dreamsong isn't perfect, but this satire on the far-right Christian lobby has more hits than misses... Music and action are seamlessly intertwined, and Dreamsong has an engaging storyline, brought to life with dynamic acting, vocals and choreography. The humour can be bleak (there are songs picketing gay funerals and abortion clinics), but the acid satire works well against the natural comic brio of Hill's shambolic, scaredy-cat Jesus\\". DreamSong was revived in 2019 by EbbFlow Theatre Company in Melbourne with a production directed by Lauren McKenna at The Alex Theatre, St Kilda, featuring Nelson Gardner, Annie Aitken, Olivia Charalambous, Nicola Bowman, Maxwell Simon, Bailey Dunnage, Kate Schmidli, Samuel Skuthorp, Luisa Scrofani, and Tayla Muir. The production featured musical direction by Maverick Newman and choreography by Maddison Lee. ===Guilty Pleasures=== In 2014 Chiarella and Tripolino collaborated with writer Josh Robson to provide songs for the one woman musical Guilty Pleasures. The show featured lyrics by Chiarella, music by Robert Tripolino and a book by Josh Robson. Guilty Pleasures was written as a vehicle for performer Angelique Cassimatis. It tells the story of five ordinary people driven to acts of extraordinary violence. The show explores how love, passion, jealousy, loneliness and desperation can lead us far beyond what we would ever imagine ourselves to be capable of. The show premiered at Chapel Off Chapel in Melbourne, before touring to the Brisbane Powerhouse and Hayes Theatre, Sydney the following year. The show received positive reviews, particularly for its songs and the central performance from Cassimatis. Coral Drouyn wrote in Stage Whispers, \\"Then there is the music ‚Äì excellent songs by Tripolino and Chiarella. It is surely only a matter of time before these great composers reach the giddy heights of Broadway. With every outing their songs grow more sophisticated, both musically through Tripolino, and with the clever and witty lyrics of Chiarella... One can't help but be reminded of a young Sondheim in these offerings... There's an edge of Sweeney Todd in the blackness of it all...\\" The show was revived in 2019 for a return season at Chapel Off Chapel, with Cassimatis once again performing. ===Evie May=== In 2016 Chiarella began collaborating with composer, Naomi Livingston, on the musical, Evie May. Evie May is set in 1966, on the evening of the last ever Tivoli performance in Sydney. The show follows veteran variety star Evie May as she recalls the events that lead her from obscurity in regional Western Australia to the bright lights of the Australian variety circuit and the many sacrifices she made to get there. Chiarella and Livingston began collaborating on the show while they were touring in the Australian cast of Les Miserables. In 2016, the show was picked up for development by New Musicals Australia and secured a season at the Hayes Theatre in Sydney in 2018 with the support of the Australia Council for the Arts. The show was directed by Kate Champion, with musical direction and orchestration by Steven Kreamer, musical supervision by Max Lambert, design by Anna Gardiner, lighting design by Sian James-Holland and sound design by Nate Edmondson. The cast featured Amanda Harrison, Loren Hunter, Keegan Joyce, Tim Draxl, Jo Turner and Bishanyia Vincent. Critic, Diana Simmonds wrote of the show, \\"Evie May is rude, funny, sad and humane in its portrayal of lives and times now gone; yet when it comes to women‚Äôs place in the world, there‚Äôs much that‚Äôs familiar. And in a musical setting, with sharp, smart lyrics, the poignancy and politics are heightened and vividly coloured. This is a remarkable addition to Australian musical theatre\\". Judith Greenaway wrote for ArtsHub, \\"Evie May ends in a bareness of space, an echo chamber of those limited choices that empowered a modern movement. This is an entertaining, crafted, timely and relevant work.\\" In his review for Stage Whispers, Peter Gotting wrote, \\"When the lights go up on this new Australian musical, there‚Äôs a sense of maturity - Sydney‚Äôs Hayes Theatre is now producing premieres of variety and accomplishment rarely seen in this country before.\\" The show was nominated for a Glug award for Most Outstanding New Australian Performed Work and Tim Draxl also received a nomination for best supporting actor in a musical. Loren Hunter and Bishanyia Vincent were also nominated for Sydney Theatre awards for best performance by a female actor in a musical and best supporting performance by a female actor in a musical for their work in the show. In 2019 a live cast recording of the show was released featuring the original cast. ==Performing== Between 2005 and 2007, Chiarella performed in the role of Mendel in the Australasian tour of Fiddler on the Roof with Chaim Topol.

Diplacanthus is an extinct genus of Mid to Late Devonian fish in the class Acanthodii, known as spiny sharks. ==Taxonomy== The genus was named by Louis Agassiz in 1843. It was formerly regarded as belonging to the Climatiformes but recently reassigned to the Diplacanthiformes, in which it is united with, amongst others, Rhadinacanthus, Uraniacanthus, and Culmacanthus. Diplacanthiforms were widespread during the Middle and early Late Devonian. They are best represented in the Middle Devonian, by articulated fossils, fin spines, and abundant scales, the latter particularly from northern Europe. In the latest revision of the genus Diplacanthus a large number of species from Europe were synonymised with earlier Scottish species, and these too were redefined. D. crassisimus was taken to have precedence over D. striatus as the name of the type specimen. Diplacanthus longispinus was reassigned to Rhadinacanthus longispinus, within which were also included Diplacanthus horridus Woodward and Diplacanthus ellsi. Diplacanthus tenuistriatus and Diplacanthus kleesmentae were however retained. Non-Laurussian species such as Diplacanthus acus from South Africa were not considered in this review. Burrow, C.

It was shot in Madrid, Ciudad Real and Biarritz (France), and tells the story of how, after the coup d'√©tat of 23 February and the imminent electoral victory of the Socialists, the Leguineche decide to take their money out of Spain to protect it. He proposed to make a fourth part about the Leguineche saga, but was frustrated for various reasons. Rafael Azcona and Luis Garcia Berlanga decided to shoot La vaquilla (one of the best films about the Spanish Civil War) first, and the death of the main actor in the saga, Luis Escobar Kirkpatrick, put an end to the project once and for all. == Story == The Marquis of Leguineche has sold his palace for four bitches and has moved with Luis Jos√©, his son, to a flat he has bought next to the Retiro, in Alfonso XII street.

Fearing that the socialists would come to power, Chus, following Luis Jos√©'s instructions, decides to sell his part of the inheritance, convert it into cash and evade the capital to France.

The Institute is named after Bernat Etxepare, author of Linguae Vasconum Primitiae (1545), the first book to be published in the Basque language, or Euskara. The phrase that defines the Institute can be found in that first book: \\"Heuscara/Ialgi hadi mundura\\" (Euskara, go out into the world). The aim is to promote the Basque language, culture and creative talent internationally, and to build lasting relationships with other countries and cultures in these areas. To this end, the Etxepare Basque Institute supports quality artistic activities and cultural mobility of artists and industry professionals, as well as teaching Euskara and Basque culture. It also encourages collaboration with international stakeholders in both the cultural and academic fields, working closely with the official Basque delegations abroad. The Etxepare Basque Institute opened its doors on 29 October 2010 at its Prim Street office in Donostia-San Sebasti√°n. In September 2015, the Institute moved to its permanent location in the Tabakalera building in Donostia. Irene Larraza is the Institute's Director (following Aizpea Goenaga and Miren Arzalluz); Garbi√±e Iztueta is Head of Promotion and Dissemination of the Basque Language, and Imanol Otaegi is Head of Promotion and Dissemination of Basque Culture. Etxepare is supported by the Basque Government Department of Education, Linguistic Policy and Culture. The Etxepare Basque Institute was created in 2007 by Law 3/2007, of April 20, that regulates the creation of the Etxepare Basque Institute. == Objectives == The purpose of the Etxepare Basque Institute is to disseminate the most significant manifestations of Basque culture. Its primary objectives are: * To encourage and promote international recognition of the Basque language. * To promote the teaching, learning and use of Euskara throughout the world. * To support research on Basque culture, especially at universities and high-level research centres. * To inspire curiosity about Basque culture. * To raise the international profile of cultural projects created in the Basque Country: encourage efforts and actions that benefit dissemination, with emphasis on promoting and ensuring an outlet for cultural undertakings created in Euskara. * Collaborate with Basque creative talent, stakeholders and producers: offer new opportunities based on needs, open access to international cultural organizations and promoters; the authors are the resource, the Institute is the bridge. == Dissemination of euskara == In its work to disseminate the Basque language, the Etxepare Basque Institute creates points of contact with other languages and communities and implements learning and research programmes at the international level. Projects in this area include Basque language and culture readership programmes at universities around the world, grants for students enrolled in these courses, Basque studies chairs and teacher training courses, among others. Etxepare has 36 readerships in different countries, plus nine university chairs: * Bernardo Atxaga Chair: City University of New York * Jon Bilbao Chair: University of Nevada Reno * Manuel de Irujo Chair: University of Liverpool * Koldo Mitxelena Chair: University of Chicago * Eduardo Chillida Chair: Frankfurt Goethe Universit√§t * Jean Haritschelhar Chair: Universit√© Bordeaux Montaigne * Eloise Garmendia Bieter Chair: Boise State University * William A. Douglass Chair: University of Massachusetts Amherst * Amale Artetxe Chair: CONICET The Institute also participates in high-profile international language forums and other language-related events to raise awareness among public institutions and people from other countries of the Basque language and its current status. Supporting translation is one of the Institute's main lines of work. Every year Etxepare provides grants for translators of Basque literature into foreign languages and manages the Etxepare-LABORAL Kutxa Translation Prize for the year's best translation. The Institute also publishes some booklets on Basque literature and culture in three languages in both paper format and online. == Dissemination of Basque Culture == At the Etxepare Basque Institute, the artists themselves play the leading role. The Institute is a mediator designed to show the world the creative work being done in the Basque Country, bringing together distinct voices for a sole purpose. To achieve this objective, Etxepare cultivates close relationships with Basque artists and the Basque cultural industry to promote their work in the most appropriate way and build bridges when necessary. The Institute attends some of the world's most important fairs devoted to education, books, film, theatre and dance, among others, in keeping with its goal to raise the profile of Basque productions and creative endeavours. It sets up meetings, promotes relations between different stakeholders and organizes activities aimed at drawing attention to our culture. One of the Institute's main focuses is collaborating with other stakeholders. The Etxepare Basque Institute continually signs agreements with private organizations and public agencies to develop specific programmes and activities. It undertakes productions and co- productions featured in high-profile cultural venues in different countries, joining forces with local agents. Likewise, the Institute collaborates in various festivals which dedicate a space to Basque culture. One example is the 'Basque Window', a glimpse into Basque cinema, which has been created for certain festivals in the Americas and Europe; another is having Euskadi (the Basque Country) as featured country at music and theatre festivals. Moreover, the Institute manages grants to promote international exposure to the Basque language and culture. Awarded in the areas of music, performing arts, audiovisuals, literature and visual arts, the grants are aimed at facilitating the participation of Basque artists in professional fairs, as well as encouraging literary translation and covering travel costs. In its commitment to reciprocity and exchange, the Etxepare Basque Institute's activities are not geared toward publicising Basque culture. However, the Institute assumes its responsibility as a two-way cultural exchange, fostering relationships with other cultures. Along the same lines, it has joined forces with other stakeholders to create residency programmes to allow Basque artists to gain experience and international exposure. == References == * * == External links == * Etxepare Basque Institute official website etxepare.eus/en ","title":"Etxepare Basque Institute"},{"id":"63933961","text":"The Canadian Beef Cattle Research, Market Development and Promotion Agency, also known as the Canadian Beef Check-Off Agency operates the Canadian Beef Cattle Check-Off (CBCC).

He is considered one of the earliest flag bearers of ambient music in Japan. ==Life and career== Ashikawa graduated from the Department of Sociology at Tokyo's Keio University in 1977. His first musical performance was at S≈çgetsu Kaikan Hall in 1974 and he participated in performances at many galleries and cultural spaces across Japan during the late 1970s. Ashikawa founded the record and book store Art Vivant in Ikebukuro, Tokyo in 1975. The shop was one of the first in Japan to import Brian Eno's Ambient records alongside a niche selection of avant garde and ethnographic LPs, and became a hub for the influential kanky≈ç ongaku (Áí∞Â¢ÉÈü≥Ê•Ω) 'environmental music' scene. Ashikawa's keyboard piece 'Still Space' was later featured as the opening track on Light in the Attic's compilation Kanky≈ç Ongaku: Japanese Ambient, Environmental & New Age Music 1980-1990. ===Sound Process and Still Way=== In 1982 Ashikawa co-founded the record label Sound Process with colleague Munetaka Tanaka, which soon grew into a sound design consultancy firm and book publisher. The label released three LPs as part of the Wave Notation series: Hiroshi Yoshimura's Music For Nine Post Cards (1982), Ashikawa's Still Way (1982) and Satsuki Shibano's Erik Satie (France 1866-1925) (1984). Still Way was Ashikawa's only full-length release and featured celebrated percussionist Midori Takada alongside harp, piano and flute players. Ashikawa described the album as \\"intended to be listened to in a casual manner, as a musical landscape or a sound object... not something that would stimulate listeners but music that should drift like smoke and become part of the environment.\\" The album received a resurgence in popularity thanks to online sharing in the late 2010s and was reissued on CD and vinyl in 2019 by WRWTFWW Records. Crack Magazine included the album in their list of '7 essential Japanese ambient and new age records', FACT called it \\"a record of chilly, beautiful stillness\\", and Exclaim! named it an \\"ambient masterpiece\\". Ashikawa was killed in a car accident the year following the release of Still Way. ==DiscographyAlbums=== * Still Way, LP (1982) - Sound Process - as composer and producer * Hiroshi Yoshimura, Music For Nine Post Cards, LP/cassette (1982) - Sound Process - as producer ===Appearances=== * 'Free Music Rev. vol.2' (recorded 1977 with Tatsuo Hattori, violin) on Japanese Underground Music in the Late 70s and 80s, CD (2016) - Loft Books * 'Still Space' on Tra New Artist Catalogue No.4, cassette (1983) - Tra Project * 'Still Space' on Kanky≈ç Ongaku (Japanese Ambient, Environmental & New Age Music 1980 - 1990), LP/CD (2019) - Light In The Attic Records == References == ==External links== *Satoshi Ashikawa at Discogs *Still Way at WRWTFWW Records Category:1983 deaths Category:1953 births Category:20th-century Japanese musicians Category:Ambient musicians Category:Keio University alumni ","title":"Satoshi Ashikawa"},{"id":"63934022","text":"Valerie Miles ( Sweet; 1914‚Äì1999) was a Welsh artist and illustrator. ==Biography== Miles was born at Aberkenfig in south Wales and studied at the Cardiff School of Art between 1932 and 1938.

The herbal drink is produced from a species under the Artemisia genus from which artemisinin is extracted for malaria treatment. Covid- Organics was developed and produced in Madagascar by the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research. Madagascar was the first country to decide to integrate Artemisia into COVID-19 treatment when the NGO Maison de l'Artemisia France contacted numerous African countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. At least one researcher from another part of Africa, Dr. J√©r√¥me Munyangi of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, contributed. Some of the research on Artemisia, led by African scientists, had been carried out in France and Canada. On 20 April 2020, Rajoelina announced in a television broadcast that his country had found \\"preventive and curative\\" cure for COVID-19. Rajoelina publicly sipped from a bottle of Covid-Organics and ordered a nation-wide distribution to families. Madagascar has confirmed a total of 3472 cases of COVID-19, and 33 deaths. == World Health Organization == On 20 May 2020, Rajoelina announced on his Twitter account that the World Health Organisation (WHO) will sign a confidentiality agreement with Madagascar regarding the formulation of CVO in order to perform clinical observation. On 21 May 2020, WHO director general Tedros Adhanom confirmed his video conference with Rajoelina, and that the WHO will cooperate with Madagascar on research and development of COVID-19 therapy. The WHO does not recommend the use of non- pharmaceutical Artemisia plant matter. == Controversy == A wide range of scientific criticism followed the launch of Covid-Organics from within and outside Africa. Before cooperating with Madagascar, the World Health Organisation (WHO) issued a warning against use of an untested COVID-19 remedy and said Africans deserve medicine that went through proper scientific trials. At the time, Covid-Organics efficacy and safety was tested on fewer than 20 people within a period of three weeks. In order to meet established scientific standards, the two parties later agreed on a partnership for Covid-Organics to be registered for WHO's Solidarity trials, an international program for fast tracking clinical trials on COVID-19 treatment candidates. The African Union (AU) demanded detailed scientific data on Covid-Organics for analysis by Africa CDC after it had been briefed by Madagascar authorities about the herbal remedy. Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention expressed its interest in data for Covid-Organics for the purpose of quickly scaling up an effective and safe remedy. In April, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) denied ordering a package of CVO after media reports that it had ordered for CVO and said the West Africa Health Organization (WAHO) would only endorse products shown to be effective and safe for use through well-known scientific procedure. As concerns about the safety of CVO grow, South Africa offered to help Madagascar conduct a clinical trial on the herbal tonic. There are concerns over widespread usage of Artemisia accelerating drug resistance toward ACTs for malaria treatment. == Patronage == More than 20 African and Caribbean countries have taken delivery of CVO as of May 2020 to combat COVID-19. On 20 May, Ghanaian government finally placed an order for CVO for testing after weeks of pressure from Ghanaians that the herbal remedy be used to halt the spread of Coronavirus. At the end of April, Equatorial Guinea, among the first to express support for the remedy, sent a special envoy to Madagascar for a donated shipment of CVO.

The case of original interest and particular importance is when this derived category is the derived category of coherent sheaves on a Calabi‚ÄìYau manifold, and this situation has fundamental links to string theory and the study of D-branes. Such stability conditions were introduced in a rudimentary form by Michael Douglas called \\\\Pi-stability and used to study BPS B-branes in string theory.Douglas, M.R., Fiol, B. and R√∂melsberger, C., 2005. Stability and BPS branes. Journal of High Energy Physics, 2005(09), p. 006. This concept was made precise by Bridgeland, who phrased these stability conditions categorically, and initiated their study mathematically.Bridgeland, T., 2007. Stability conditions on triangulated categories. Annals of Mathematics, pp. 317‚Äì345. ==Definition== The definitions in this section are presented as in the original paper of Bridgeland, for arbitrary triangulated categories. Let \\\\mathcal{D} be a triangulated category. A slicing \\\\mathcal{P} of \\\\mathcal{D} is a collection of full additive subcategories \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\varphi) for each \\\\varphi\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} such that * \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\varphi)[1] = \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\varphi+1) for all \\\\varphi, where [1] is the shift functor on the triangulated category, * if \\\\varphi_1 > \\\\varphi_2 and A\\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\varphi_1) and B\\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\varphi_2), then \\\\operatorname{Hom}(A,B)=0, and * for every object E\\\\in \\\\mathcal{D} there exists a finite sequence of real numbers \\\\varphi_1>\\\\varphi_2>\\\\cdots>\\\\varphi_n and a collection of triangles :::left :with A_i\\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\varphi_i) for all i. The last property should be viewed as axiomatically imposing the existence of Harder‚ÄìNarasimhan filtrations on elements of the category \\\\mathcal{D}. A Bridgeland stability condition on a triangulated category \\\\mathcal{D} is a pair (Z,\\\\mathcal{P}) consisting of a slicing \\\\mathcal{P} and a group homomorphism Z: K(\\\\mathcal{D}) \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}, where K(\\\\mathcal{D}) is the Grothendieck group of \\\\mathcal{D}, called a central charge, satisfying * if 0 e E\\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}(\\\\varphi) then Z(E) = m(E) \\\\exp(i\\\\pi \\\\varphi) for some strictly positive real number m(E) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}_{> 0}. It is convention to assume the category \\\\mathcal{D} is essentially small, so that the collection of all stability conditions on \\\\mathcal{D} forms a set \\\\operatorname{Stab}(\\\\mathcal{D}). In good circumstances, for example when \\\\mathcal{D} = \\\\mathcal{D}^b \\\\operatorname{Coh}(X) is the derived category of coherent sheaves on a complex manifold X, this set actually has the structure of a complex manifold itself. It is shown by Bridgeland that the data of a Bridgeland stability condition is equivalent to specifying a bounded t-structure \\\\mathcal{P}(>0) on the category \\\\mathcal{D} and a central charge Z: K(\\\\mathcal{A})\\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} on the heart \\\\mathcal{A} = \\\\mathcal{P}((0,1]) of this t-structure which satisfies the Harder‚ÄìNarasimhan property above. An element E\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A} is semi-stable (resp. stable) with respect to the stability condition (Z,\\\\mathcal{P}) if for every surjection E \\\\to F for F\\\\in \\\\mathcal{A}, we have \\\\varphi(E) \\\\le (\\\\text{resp.}<) \\\\, \\\\varphi(F) where Z(E) = m(E) \\\\exp(i\\\\pi \\\\varphi(E)) and similarly for F. ==References== Category:Geometry Category:String theory Category:Algebraic geometry ","title":"Bridgeland stability condition"},{"id":"63934102","text":"√âtienne Vincent (born 1902, date of death unknown) was a French diver.

She is a Stadtman investigator at the National Cancer Institute. == Early life and education == Cahoon is from Tbilisi, Georgia. Her family immigrated when she was a child. She received a B.S.E. in bioengineering from the University of Pennsylvania. Cahoon completed a S.M. from the Engineering Systems Division at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her 2003 master's thesis was titled Telemedicine as a disruptive technology: implications for home health agencies and nurses. Her academic advisor was . She earned a M.H.S. in biostatistics and Ph.D. in epidemiology from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Her dissertation was titled, Prevention in the severely mentally ill: primary care quality and adverse events among persons with schizophrenia, and the benefit of physical activity on sleep in a community sample of persons with severe mental illness. Cahoon's doctoral advisors were Jonathan Samet and . She was a postdoctoral fellow in the department of mental health at Bloomberg School of Public Health. She joined the radiation epidemiology branch (REB) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) as a postdoctoral fellow in 2010. == Career == Cahoon was promoted to research fellow in 2014. In 2017, she was appointed to the position of Earl Stadtman Tenure-Track Investigator. === Research === Cahoon researches cancer and precancer risks conferred by environmental sources of radiation exposure. Her program focuses on studies of preventable risk factors that modify the relationship between ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and the risk of skin cancer and other cancers (in the general population in the United States and in people with especially high risk such as organ-transplant recipients, and studies that address unanswered questions about people exposed to ionizing radiation including residents and clean-up workers exposed after the Chernobyl accident (1986) and Japanese survivors of the atomic bombings (1945) of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. She works to identify medications that modify the relationship between UV radiation and skin cancer risk. Cahoon also evaluates the UV radiation dose-response relationship for skin cancer risk by wavelength, age at exposure, and anatomic site. In addition, Cahoon evaluates the role of UV radiation in viral activation, immune modulation, and other mediators of skin (and other) cancer risk. Her previous work identified a relationship between ambient UV radiation and risk of Kaposi sarcoma, possibly through reactivation of the causative virus, human herpesvirus 8. Cahoon is working towards confirming these findings in independent populations. Cahoon examines radiation-related risk of various cancer types in the lifespan study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors and is also leading a thyroid cancer case- control study nested in a cohort of Chernobyl liquidators (i.e., emergency clean-up workers) who were exposed to a large range of external radiation. Cahoon examines the incidence of new thyroid nodules in Belarus and Ukraine and progression of prevalent nodules. These will be the first studies to evaluate whether nodule characteristics associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer, such as size and vascularization, are apparent at clinical diagnosis or whether these characteristics emerge and evolve over time. == Awards and honors == Cahoon has received numerous awards for her work, including the DCEG Intramural Research Award, the DCEG Outstanding Research Paper by a Fellow, and the NIH Award of Merit. == References == Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:National Institutes of Health people Category:21st-century American women scientists Category:American epidemiologists Category:Women epidemiologists Category:Georgian emigrants to the United States Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:21st-century American scientists Category:University of Pennsylvania alumni Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health alumni ","title":"Elizabeth K.

It primarily publishes domestic and international works of literary fiction. ==History== G√©za K√©pes, 1963. Magvet≈ë was established in 1955 as a publisher of the Magyar √çr√≥k Sz√∂vets√©ge (now the Hungarian Writers' Association). Its main task was to publish contemporary Hungarian fiction and classical Hungarian literature. However, it also published world literature works since it was founded. Upon its founding, a special competitive situation was created within the framework of the state socialist system between Magvet≈ë and the similar publisher Sz√©pirodalmi K√∂nyvkiad√≥. It soon became apparent that works which differed from the mainstream of literary policy, which provoked political or aesthetic debates, were more likely to be published by Magvet≈ë. Such works included Endre Fejes's Rozsdatemet≈ë, G√©za Ottlik's Hajnali h√°ztet≈ëk and Ferenc S√°nta's H√∫sz √≥ra. Magvet≈ë published works by Iv√°n M√°ndy, Mikl√≥s M√©sz√∂ly, L√°szl√≥ Nagy, √Ågnes Nemes Nagy, G√©za Ottlik, Ott√≥ Orb√°n, Istv√°n √ñrk√©ny, Magda Szab√≥ √©s S√°ndor We√∂res is.

He has served as the 11th Bishop of Wangaratta since February 2020. ==Early life and parish ministry== Bester was born, raised and educated in Cape Town, South Africa. He wanted to be a priest from age 13 or 14, but after his education took a job at the National Library of South Africa as a library assistant. He was offered a full scholarship to study library science but declined it to take up the opportunity to enter ministry. In 1996, Bester was ordained as deacon in the Anglican Diocese of Cape Town in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa. He then served in various parishes in the Diocese of False Bay where he was ordained as priest, and later collated as Archdeacon. He served as Rector of Strand for 12 years, as well as Archdeacon of Helderberg from 2006‚Äì2010, and Archdeacon to the Ordinary from 2010‚Äì2014. During 2007 and 2013 Bester served as locum in the Diocese in Europe at the Chaplaincy of Bonn and Cologne and Chaplaincy of Strasbourg respectively. Bester still holds permission to officiate in that diocese. In 2014, Bester decided to move overseas with his family, and when he was not able to pursue further options in the United Kingdom or Europe, he pursued three options in Australia in Bunbury, Perth and Shepparton. He chose the latter because he received a response from the Archdeacon of Wangaratta within an hour, and because it gave him an opportunity to work with a fellow South African. Bester was eventually appointed as assistant priest in the Shepparton Parish, where he served for 20 months, during which time he was asked to do a ministry development plan for the parish, and was included on the Diocese‚Äôs strategic planning operational team. He found the smaller size of congregations in Wangaratta a challenge compared to ministry in South Africa. On 26 November 2016, Bester was appointed as priest of the Parish of Wangaratta West and the Warbys. On the same day, he was collated as Archdeacon for Ministry Development within the Diocese by Bishop John Parkes. The role was designed to strengthen the capacity of the diocese and offer new opportunities. After a further 14 months, he was appointed as full-time Diocesan Archdeacon and Bishop's Commissary, and on 1 November 2018 as Vicar- General of the Diocese. He administered the diocese following the retirement of Bishop John Parkes. Bester's time at Wangaratta was characterised as him being involved in ministry development, clergy development and recruitment and in clergy and lay training as well as exploring new models of ministry for the diocese. ==Episcopal ministry== On 21 December 2019, Bester was elected as the 11th Bishop of Wangaratta, replacing John Parkes who had recently retired. Before his appointment he was required to manage the Diocese's response to the 2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfire season which affected the diocese. Bester was consecrated bishop in St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne on 22 February 2020 by Archbishop of Melbourne and then-Anglican Primate of Australia Philip Freier, and enthroned in Holy Trinity Cathedral, Wangaratta on 23 February 2020. Bester stated at the time of his appointment that he was \\"deeply humbled\\" to take on the role of bishop, saw his role as to make a difference to people's lives but saw it as a \\"team effort\\" for all within the Diocese. ==Advocacy== Bester is a supporter of LGBTQI inclusion and allowing the blessing of same- sex unions in the Anglican Church of Australia. In 2018, he moved a motion in the Wangaratta Diocese to explore the blessing of same-sex marriages. A planned blessing of the civil same-sex marriage of two priests in the Diocese resulting from that motion was called off in September 2019 after the motion was referred to the Anglican Church of Australia's Appellate Tribunal on its legality. In October 2019, Bester criticised Archbishop of Sydney Glenn Davies for a speech asking bishops who disagreed with the church's doctrine on same- sex marriage to leave the Anglican Church. ==Personal life== Bester became an Australian citizen on Australia Day 2020. Bester met his wife Michelle, a recruitment consultant, during his first ministry posting in South Africa.

He was one of the first victims in the battles for the liberation of Smederevo. As a respectable merchant, ƒêu≈°a was a legitimately elected leader of the insurgent Serbs from the Smederevo nahija and he led his people in the fight against the Turks. Petar Jokiƒá, the commander of Karaƒëorƒëe's personal guard, states that there were 200 of them, and with Dr. Miroslav Djordjeviƒá the number of insurgents increased to 400, and that, according to an Austrian report, on 25 February, Karaƒëorƒëe was in Azanja with his main detachment. He was also accompanied by Belgrade Metropolitan Leontije, Pavle (Stojko) Krivokuƒáa of Ad≈æibegovac and other insurgents.

He became dean of Windsor in 1677. ==Early life== Durel was born at St Helier, Jersey, the son of Jean le Vavaseur dit Durel and his wife, Susanne Effard, daughter of Nicolas Effard. He matriculated at St Alban Hall, Oxford and entered Merton College, Oxford, in 1640. When Oxford was garrisoned by Charles I at the beginning of the English Civil War, he left for France. There he studied at Caen, where he proceeded M.A. at the Coll√®ge du Bois in 1644. He then studied divinity at the protestant University of Saumur. In 1647 Durel returned to Jersey as chaplain to Lieutenant-governor George Carteret, and participated in its defence. He was sent by Carteret on a mission to Paris in early summer of 1651, and at the private chapel of Sir Richard Browne, 1st Baronet, of Deptford, the resident English ambassador in Paris, was ordained deacon and priest, on Trinity Sunday, by Thomas Sydserff, the Bishop of Galloway, in company with Daniel Brevint. After the Battle of Worcester in September 1651, a Commonwealth fleet under Robert Blake sailed for Jersey. Jean Poingdestre and Durel were sent as messengers to the exiled Charles II in late October, at which point the Parliamentary forces had taken the whole island except Elizabeth Castle, and Castle Cornet on Guernsey was still holding out. They returned with the king's order to Carteret to make terms. Carteret signed a surrender to James Heane on 15 December. ==In exile== Durel moved to France after the fall of Jersey, and resided briefly at St Malo. He officiated a short time at Caen in place of Samuel Bochart, and after declining an offer from William VI, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel became chaplain for eight years to the Duc de la Force. In Normandy he met Jean-Maximilien de Baux, seigneur de l'Angle (:fr:Jean-Maximilien de Langle), a like-minded Huguenot minister, who became his father-in-law some years later. During his time in Guyenne with the Duc, Durel kept abreast of English politics and polemics. He wrote in May 1654 to William Edgeman, secretary to Sir Edward Hyde. He mentioned then an intention, apparently unfulfilled, to reply to John Milton's Eikonoklastes. His name has been brought up in relation with a reply to Milton's Defensio pro Populo Anglicano of 1651, along with that of Dirk Graswinckel. The pseudonymous \\"Ambiorix Ariovistus\\" who wrote it is now taken to be Henrik Ernst (1603‚Äì1665), a German tutor at the Sor√∏ Academy.S. A. J. Bradley, Ambiorix Ariovistus, Detractor of Milton's \\"Defensio,\\" Identified, Modern Philology Vol. 73, No. 4, Part 1 (May, 1976), pp. 382‚Äì388, at p. 383. Published by: The University of Chicago Press Milton's The Reason of Church- Government Urged against Prelaty of 1642 was against Certain Briefe Treatises (Oxford, 1641), a collection of tracts of which one was identified by James Smith Candlish to David Masson, in the 19th century, as by \\"John Durel\\" rather than John Dury; Lewalski disagrees. Early in 1660, as the restoration of the House of Stuart seemed likely, Brevint, Durel and Philippe Le Couteur, all from Jersey, were recruited by Sir Robert Moray, on behalf of the Earl of Lauderdale, to solicit letters of support from leading Huguenots. By March they had considerable success, and some of the letters were published, with an impact on English Presbyterians such as Richard Baxter. The Jersey group were then asked to set up a synod at Charenton, by Madame de Turenne, again through Moray: the royalists here followed a plan of George Morley to win over Protestant ministers. Such a synod met with legal problems, and it is unclear whether it occurred. But again letters of support were gained. Whatever the outcome for Charenton, Durel and other Jersey clergy did attend shortly a synod at Caen, undermining Huguenot support for English Presbyterians intent on continuing their opposition to the Church of England. ==The French Church, London== In 1660 Durel returned to England. That year he helped set up the recognised French Church, London, in a chapel in the grounds of the Savoy Hospital (not the later Savoy Chapel). There was an existing French congregation from the Protectorate, and Jean D'Espagne had preached to them in the chapel of Somerset House; which Henrietta Maria claimed back. Charles II granted use of the chapel, subject to the right to appoint the minister, to be instituted by the Bishop of London, and the liturgical use of the Book of Common Prayer.Elizabeth Randall, 1. A special case?: London‚Äôs French Protestants, pp. 13‚Äì42, at pp. 25‚Äì26. Durel was appointed minister of the French Church with a royal pension, once Daniel Brevint had been found a living. On 14 January 1661 he preached his first sermon there, and the liturgy of the Church of England was read in French for the first time. That year Durel heard the nuncupative will of his friend John Colladon. Belonging to a \\"conformist\\" group of Francophone clergy, who wished to reconcile the Church of England with Huguenot and Reformed practice generally, Durel had as allies Isaac Basire and Samuel Brevint, tolerant of episcopacy, and Peter Du Moulin. Among the opposing voices was Jean Gailhard, who had arrived in England c.1660, and whose sympathies lay with the Puritans. An argument going back to John Calvin, used by Durel, was the \\"five centuries\\" of the primitive church and Christian fathers that could be accepted as a basis for the Church of England's posture.John C. English, The Duration of the Primitive Church: An Issue for Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century Anglicans, Anglican and Episcopal History, Vol. 73, No. 1 (March 2004), pp. 35‚Äì52, at p. 41 note 16. Published by: Historical Society of the Episcopal Church The conformist position was not liked by all of Durel's congregation: but the chapel was close to Whitehall Palace, and the trade-off between religious preferences and political positioning was successful. The congregation of D'Espagne had met at Durham House, and contained nobility and gentry. There was an existing Huguenot and Genevan Calvinist church on Threadneedle Street, some way to the east, in the City of London: this new \\"Anglo-Gallican\\" church, La Savoie, was viewed there as an unwelcome rival. On the other hand, Protestant leaders in continental Europe were pleased. Rapid preferment then came for Durel. He was recommended by the king to Brian Duppa, the Bishop of Winchester, in October 1661, for the reversion of the sinecure held by James Hamilton, Bishop of Galloway. He succeeded John Earle as royal chaplain to Charles II in 1662. He was made rector of Overton, Hampshire in 1663. In 1664 he became canon of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, in 1665 prebendary of North Aulton in Salisbury Cathedral. ==Comprehension== The outcome of the Savoy Conference of the first half of 1661, held on the same site as Durel's chapel, led in 1662 to the exodus of non-conformists from the Church of England now called the Great Ejection. During the 1660s some of the Presbyterian ministers involved still hoped for \\"comprehension\\": inclusion of their congregations within the Church, in good standing. The Presbyterian leaders Richard Baxter and Thomas Manton pursued this goal, at cross-purposes with John Owen who aimed for religious toleration for Presbyterians. With Jacques Cou√´t-du Vivier, minister at Courcelles and grandson of Paul Ferry (1612‚Äì1669), minister at Metz, Durel went to observe Manton at his church St Paul's, Covent Garden in 1661. Manton read the Prayer Book liturgy at length, and the congregation received it well. After 1662, however, Manton was a conventicle preacher in the London area.Roger Mazauric, Lettres de Jacques Cou√´t-du Vivier √† Paul Ferry (suite), Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© de l'Histoire du Protestantisme Fran√ßais (1903-2015) Vol. 124 (Avril, Mai, Juin 1978), pp. 249‚Äì281, at p. 256. Published by: Librairie Droz Bosher's account of the period 1660 to 1662, from the point of view of the returning bishops, argues for continuity with Laudian values: * At the Savoy Conference, the Church position was at the beginning flexible. * The religious uniformity sought was for ceremonial and liturgy, not theology. * The expulsion of Puritans was not an intended consequence of the Conference, as began to be argued in the late 17th century. * The Act of Uniformity 1662 was a product of the House of Commons. Richard Baxter had a Latin letter of April 1660 from Raymond Gaches (1615‚Äì1668), minister at Castres and one of Daniel Brevint's contacts in Moray's campaign. It was written at the request of Anna Mackenzie, who knew both Baxter and Gaches, and gave assurances from personal observation on Charles II's religious views. Baxter discussed possible ways of answering Durel's apologetics: but he did not publish, and the sustained Presbyterian criticism began only in the 1670s. He knew in advance (1669) that Louis du Moulin was planning such a work: in Latin, it saw du Moulin imprisoned. ==Later life== In 1668 Durel was installed prebendary of Durham Cathedral with a rich donative. In February 1670 he was created D.D. at Oxford. In 1677 he was made registrar of the Order of the Garter, and in the same year he was appointed dean of Windsor and consequently of Wolverhampton. The fine living of Witney, Oxfordshire, was soon afterwards granted him by the king, his chief recommendation to King Charles being that \\"he was not only a good scholar but a perfect courtier.\\" Durel died 8 June 1683, and is buried in the north aisle adjoining Windsor Chapel choir. ==Works== Durel's major work was published in 1669, in vindication of the English church against schismatics, and entitled Sanctae ecclesiae Anglicanae schismaticorum criminationes, London, pp. cxiv and 538. It was dedicated to Charles II, and a second issue was printed in 1672 as Historia rituum sanctae ecclesiae Anglicanae. Presbyterians retorted by Bonasus Vapulans, or some Castigations given to Mr. John Durell (1672) by Henry Hickman, republished as The Nonconformists Vindicated (1679); and Patronus Bon√¶ Fidei (1672), attributed to Louis du Moulin. Durel published also: * His master's thesis, Theoremata philosophiae rationalis, moralis, naturalis et supernaturalis, Caen, 1644. * No. 6 (14 March 1647) of the Disputationes de Argumentis, published by Josu√© de la Place, Saumur, 1649. Durel had been awarded a B.D. by Saumur Academy, in 1647. * Sermon prononc√© en l'√©glise fran√ßoise (1661), translated as The Liturgy of the Church of England Asserted (1662), dedicated to James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormond. The text was . A View of the Government and Publick Worship of God in the Reformed Churches beyond the Seas (1662) was answered in a work once attributed to Henry Hickman, Apologia pro Ministris in Anglia (attribution rejected by Gibson in the Dictionary of National Biography). In it, Durel mentions an ambition to collect the liturgies of all the Protestant churches. It contains positive comment on the Unitas Fratrum (Moravians), then under threat in Central Europe, and supported by John Amos Comenius. Durel, and also Herbert Thorndike, were interested in the Unitas as a Protestant church with bishops. Durel's Protestant ecumenism was designed for arguments based on the Elizabethan settlement, and against the English dissenters following the Act of Uniformity 1662. It allowed for such comparisons with Protestant churches outside England. ===Translation of the Book of Common Prayer=== Needing the Book of Common Prayer in French in a hurry to begin his London ministry, Durel used the 1616 version by Pierre Delaune or de Laune, reprinted in an edition that quickly sold out. It has been commented that \\"Durel's temporary edition of 1661 shares with the Maltese Prayer Book of 1845 the distinction of being the rarest of all the foreign-language versions of the English Liturgy.\\" The king then asked Durel to translate the work again into French, and ordered the book to be used in the parish churches of Guernsey and Jersey and at the Savoy chapel. The Savoy Conference of 1661 had made a revision of the Book. Durel produced a translation of the 1662 Prayer Book, therefore. It was closely based on the century-old translation by Francis Philippe, made for Thomas Goodrich. The right of sole printing was granted 6 October 1662, and the Bishop of London's chaplain sanctioned it in 1663, but Durel's work did not appear until 1667, as La Liturgie, c'est √† dire Le Formulaire des Pri√®res publiques. White Kennett stated that this translation was accepted by the Reformed church in France. In the 1680s questions were raised about its consistency with the English original. The 1662 Book of Common Prayer was given to John Earle, Bishop of Salisbury and John Pearson for translation into Latin. Earle died, and Pearson and his replacement John Dolben became bishops: the completion of the translation then passed to Durel. Earle's portion was lost in the Great Fire of London, but a portion of Dolben's manuscript was found. Durel's work, of which he calls himself editor, was published in 1670 as Liturgia, seu Liber Precum Communium et Administrationis Sacramentorum (for the first time \\"communium\\" is used, for the previous \\"publicarum\\"). There were at least seven editions down to 1703. ==Family== Durel married in 1664, at Rouen, Marie de Baux, daughter of Jean- Maximilien de Baux, seigneur de l'Angle. ==Notes== ==External linksAttribution=== Category:1625 births Category:1683 deaths Category:Jersey clergy Category:Anglican priests Category:Canons of Windsor Category:Deans of Windsor Category:Translators to French Category:Translators to Latin Category:Translators from English ","title":"John Durel"},{"id":"63934555","text":"The Wild Choir () is a poetry collection by Nobel laureate in literature Knut Hamsun.

On 12 May, a hospital's maternity ward in Kabul and a funeral in Kuz Kunar (Khewa), Nangarhar were attacked, resulting in the deaths of 56 people and injuries of 148 others, including newborn babies, mothers, nurses, and mourners. ISIL‚ÄìKP claimed responsibility for the funeral bombing, but no insurgent group claimed responsibility for the hospital shooting. The Afghan government blamed the Taliban as the main perpetrators behind the 12 May attacks, and immediately ordered the military to resume its offensives against the Taliban and other insurgent groups. The Taliban, however, denied involvement. The U.S. government said that ISIL‚ÄìKP conducted the 12 May attacks, not the Taliban, but this assertion was rejected by Afghan officials. The Taliban announced that it would conduct revenge attacks against the Afghan government for blaming it for the 12 May attacks, and conducted suicide bombings in Gardez and Ghazni, which killed nine intelligence personnel and five civilians, and wounded 69 others. The Taliban then attempted to capture Kunduz, attacking several government posts in the city during which eight soldiers, four civilians, and one policeman were killed, and 73 others were injured. The Taliban attack on Kunduz was repelled by the Afghan security forces. == Background == On 29 February 2020, the U.S. signed a peace agreement with the Taliban in Qatar, which set the conditions for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. However, despite the agreement, attacks against Afghan security forces surged in the country. In the 45 days after the agreement (between 1 March and 15 April), the Taliban conducted more than 4,500 attacks in Afghanistan, which showed an increase of more than 70% as compared to the same period in the previous year. More than 900 Afghan security forces were killed in the period, up from about 520 in the same period a year earlier. Meanwhile, because of a significant reduction in the number of offensives and airstrikes by Afghan and U.S. forces against the Taliban due to the agreement, Taliban casualties dropped to 610 in the period down from about 1,660 in the same period a year earlier. The Pentagon spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said that although the Taliban stopped conducting attacks against the U.S.-led coalition forces in Afghanistan, the violence was still \\"unacceptably high\\" and \\"not conducive to a diplomatic solution.\\" == Insurgent attacks before 12 May == On 1 May, the Taliban attacked Balkh Province's Zari District overnight, killing 13 members of the Afghan security forces and injuring 17 others. On 2 May, a motorbike bomb exploded outside the provincial prison in Mihtarlam, Laghman Province, killing three civilians and injuring four members of the security forces. Noor Mohammad, director of Laghman's provincial prison directorate, was among the injured. On 3 May, seven Afghan security forces were killed and at least 12 others wounded in a suicide truck bomb attack on a military and intelligence base in Grishk District, Helmand Province. A Mazda mini truck was exploded in front of the gate by the suicide attacker, partially damaging the base. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. In a separate attack on 3 May, the Taliban threw a hand grenade into a mosque in Khairkot District, Paktika Province, injuring 20 worshipers who were offering the night prayer after having broken their Ramadan fast. On 4 May, four employees of the state-owned power company, Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS), were wounded in a bomb explosion in northern Kabul when they were returning to Kabul after repairing a transmission tower destroyed by gunmen earlier. Two of the four were in critical condition. On the same day, a policewoman was assassinated in the center of Kandahar, making her the fifth policewoman to be killed during the previous two months in Kandahar. No group claimed responsibility for the killing of the policewoman. On 7 May, a roadside bomb explosion in Nadir Shah Kot District, Khost Province killed Gen. Sayed Ahmad Babazai, the Police Chief of Khost Province, his secretary, and one bodyguard, and also wounded another person. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Just before the two 12 May attacks, there was a devastating attack in the night of 10 May, during which the Taliban attacked a convoy and security post in Alishing District, Laghman Province, northeast of Kabul. 27 Afghan soldiers were killed and several military vehicles were destroyed, while nine soldiers remained missing after the attack. == 12 May attacks == At 10 AM on 12 May 2020, three gunmen wearing police uniforms carried out a mass shooting in the maternity ward of a hospital in Kabul. The hospital is located in the predominately Shi'ite Hazara neighborhood of Dashte Barchi and is assisted by M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (Doctors Without Borders) personnel. The attackers killed 24 people and injured another 16. The deaths included two newborn babies, one midwife, and 16 mothers, who were either pregnant giving birth or were with their newborns. Three of the mothers were shot and killed in the delivery room along with their unborn babies. The gunmen had walked straight past other wards closer to the hospital's entrance, and attacked only the maternity ward. More than 80 women, infants, and staff, including three foreign nationals, were safely evacuated from the hospital, and all of the attackers were killed by the Afghan security forces and their mentoring Norwegian special forces. According to Frederic Bonnot, M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res' head of programs in Afghanistan: \\"I went back the day after the attack and what I saw in the maternity (ward) demonstrates it was a systematic shooting of the mothers. They went through the rooms in the maternity (ward), shooting women in their beds. It was methodical. Walls sprayed with bullets, blood on the floors in the rooms, vehicles burnt out and windows shot through.\\" Bonnot added: \\"It‚Äôs shocking. We know this area has suffered attacks in the past, but no one could believe they would attack a maternity. They came to kill the mothers.\\" About an hour after the Kabul attack, a suicide bombing took place in Kuz Kunar District (also known as Khewa District), Nangarhar Province at the funeral of Shaikh Akram, a former commander of the district's police force, who had died of a heart attack a day earlier. The blast killed 32 people and injured 133 others, some severely. Abdullah Malikzai, a member of Nangarhar's provincial council, was killed in the attack, while his father, Malik Qais Noor Agha, a lawmaker, was wounded. ===Responsibility for the 12 May attacks=== The Afghan government blamed the Taliban for the attacks on 12 May, and immediately ordered the military to resume its offensives against the Taliban and other insurgent groups. Amrullah Saleh, the Vice President of Afghanistan, said that there was an evidence that the Taliban plotted the attacks and that the Taliban were in \\"celebratory mood\\" after the attacks. Saleh added: \\"They double celebrate the naivete of some for accepting their lies and accusing the fictional IS-K.\\" The acting interior minister, Masoud Andarabi, said: ‚ÄúThis indicates close cooperation between the Haqqani network and the Daesh group [ISIL], and also the attack is a war crime. This shows that the Taliban do not have any commitment to the agreement they signed.‚Äù The Taliban, however, denied responsibility for the 12 May attacks. Suhail Shaheen, spokesman of the Taliban office in Qatar, claimed: \\"These are extreme barbaric acts and only ISIS terrorists could show such brutality. Unfortunately, such elements are working under the cover of Afghan intelligence agencies and are carrying out false flag operations. The sole aim of such attacks is to destroy the peace agreement that was signed in Doha on February 29, 2020.\\" Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ‚Äì Khorasan Province (ISIL‚ÄìKP) claimed responsibility for the Kuz Kunar funeral bombing in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. However, no armed group claimed responsibility for the Kabul hospital shooting. On 15 May, the United States government said that it had assessed that ISIL‚ÄìKP was responsible for the 12 May attacks, rather than the Taliban. However, Afghan officials rejected this assertion, and reiterated that the Taliban and the affiliated Haqqani network were behind the attacks. The Taliban, however, claimed responsibility for more than a dozen other deadly attacks in Afghanistan in May 2020. === Reaction to the 12 May attacks === The Taliban denied responsibility for the 12 May attacks and called them \\"heinous\\". Suhail Shaheen, spokesman of the Taliban office in Qatar, claimed: \\"The Taliban could not even think of attacking a maternity hospital and funeral prayers.\\" Interior ministry spokesman Tariq Aryan described the Kabul hospital attack as an \\"act against humanity and a war crime.\\" The UN Secretary General, Ant√≥nio Guterres, strongly condemned the 12 May attacks. While the 15-member Security Council issued a statement reaffirming \\"that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.\\" The council also emphasized that the \\"heinous and cowardly terrorist attacks\\" took place during Ramadan and that ISIL‚ÄìKP had claimed responsibility for the blast in Nangarhar. The chief of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom, said he was \\"shocked and appalled\\" by the Kabul attack and said that hospitals \\"should never be a target.\\" Deborah Lyons, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, denounced the hospital attack, saying: ‚ÄúWho attacks newborn babies and new mothers? Who does this? The most innocent of innocents, a baby! Why?‚Äù U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the \\"horrific terrorist attacks\\" and said that ‚Äúany attack on innocents is unforgivable, but to attack infants and women in labor in the sanctuary of a hospital is an act of sheer evil.‚Äù UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Twitter that he was \\"horrified by the appalling terrorist attacks in Afghanistan today - including on a maternity hospital. Targeting mothers, their newborns and medical staff is despicable.\\" The External Affairs Ministry of India released a statement condemning the 12 May attacks and calling them \\"barbaric\\". It added that \\"Such reprehensible attacks, including on mothers, newly born children, nurses and mourning families are appalling and constitute crimes against humanity.\\" and urged for the responsible to be brought to swift justice. Human rights group Amnesty International tweeted \\"The unconscionable war crimes in Afghanistan today, targeting a maternity hospital and a funeral, must awaken the world to the horrors civilians continue to face\\". Human Rights Watch also demanded to bring the perpetrators to justice for this \\"war crime\\". == Insurgent attacks after 12 May until the ceasefire == On 14 May, the Taliban carried out a retaliation attack near a court in Gardez, Paktia Province: a suicide truck bomber tried to explode himself outside a military compound, but exploded before its destination. The attack resulted in five civilians killed and at least 29 others injured. The Taliban claimed this as a revenge attack, after President Ashraf Ghani blamed the group for the attack at the maternity hospital; the Taliban denied responsibility for the hospital attack. On the same day, the Taliban also attacked a checkpoint in Firozkoh (also known as Chaghcharan), Ghor Province, killing three soldiers and taking 11 others captive. On 16 May, in an overnight attack on a security checkpoint in Paktia Province's Ahmad Aba District, the Taliban killed eight soldiers and wounded nine others. The soldiers had been providing security for a multi- purpose dam. In addition, the Taliban also abducted 12 civilians in the province's Tsamkani District, charging them for \\"collaborating with the government\\". Also on 16 May, a roadside bomb targeting healthcare workers in Khost exploded, injuring six civilians, including the assistant to the Khost Public Health commissioner and three doctors. All the injured were carried to Khost Civil Hospital for emergency treatment. On 17 May, the Taliban attacked a security checkpoint near the Mes Aynak mine, the country's largest copper mine, in Mohammad Agha District, Logar Province, southeast of Kabul. Eight security guards were killed and five others wounded. On 18 May, a suicide Humvee bomber affiliated with the Taliban killed nine intelligence personnel and injured 40 others at the National Directorate of Security (NDS) unit in Ghazni, Afghanistan, also damaging the nearby Islamic Cultural Centre. On the same day in Jaghat≈´ District, Ghazni Province, insurgents killed two police officers and three civilians on a road and set their bodies on fire. Late on 18 May, a roadside IED planted by militants in Mezana District, Zabul Province killed four civilians and injured nine others. On 19 May, the Taliban killed one policeman and one civilian and injured 18 others in a motorbike bomb in Kunduz, Afghanistan. On the same day, the Taliban attempted to capture Kunduz, attacking several government posts but were repelled by the Afghan security forces. The Taliban were forced to flee the city, leaving ten dead bodies behind. Eight Afghan soldiers and three civilians were killed and 55 others were wounded during the Taliban attack. A clinic in the nearby Chardara District of Kunduz Province, where Taliban militants were also being treated, was partially damaged in an airstrike. Also on 19 May, gunmen opened fire in a mosque in Charikar, Parwan Province, killing 11 worshippers and injuring 16 others when they were offering the evening prayer after breaking their Ramadan fast. The Taliban denied their involvement in the attack. At the same time, gunmen also killed three brothers and injured a child in Sabari District, Khost Province when they were returning to their home from a nearby mosque. The Taliban also denied their role in this attack. Later in the day, insurgents launched attacks on checkpoints in Khwaja Bahauddin District, Takhar Province, killing nine pro-government militiamen and wounding six others. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the latter attack. == Insurgent attacks after the ceasefire == After the end of the three-day Eid ceasefire announced by the Taliban, which lasted from 24 to 26 May, the Taliban attacked a checkpoint in Ghorband District (also known as Syagird District), Parwan Province late in the night of 27 May. This was the first deadly attack by the Taliban after the ceasefire. They set fire to the checkpoint, which killed five Afghan troops, and shot dead two others. One other soldier was injured in the attack and two others were held captive, while one Taliban attacker was also killed. On 28 May, the Taliban killed seven policemen in Farah in an attack on a police post during which eight Taliban militants were also killed. In the early hours of 29 May, the Taliban stormed border security forces check posts in Paktia Province's Dand Aw Patan District, which lies on the border with the Kurram District of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 14 Afghan security personnel were killed in the attack and three others were injured. Two members of the Taliban were also killed during the attack. On 30 May, a private bus carrying 15 employees of the Khurshid TV news station was hit by a road bomb in Kabul, killing an economic reporter, Mir Wahed Shah, a technician, Shafiq Amiri, and wounding seven other people. ISIL claimed responsibility hours after the attack, describing Khurshid TV as being \\"loyal to the Afghan apostate government.\\" This was the second deadly attack against the channel in less than a year. The United States, the European Union, and NATO condemned the attack. Further attacks occurred the following month. ==See also== *Drowning of Afghan refugees in the Hari River ‚Äì by Iran's border guards on 1 May 2020 *March 2017 Kabul attack ‚Äì militant attack at a Kabul hospital *May 2017 Kabul attack ‚Äì killing over 150 and injuring 413 *May 2010 Kabul bombing ==References== Category:2020 in Kabul Category:2020 mass shootings in Asia May attacks Category:21st century in Ghazni Province Category:21st century in Helmand Province Category:21st century in Kandahar Category:21st century in Kunduz Province Category:21st century in Nangarhar Province Category:21st century in Parwan Province Category:21st century in Zabul Province May 2020 attacks Category:Arson in Asia Category:Arson in the 2020s Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in 2020 Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in Kabul Category:Attacks on hospitals Category:Attacks on mosques in Asia Category:Crime in Kandahar Province Category:Crime in Nangarhar Province Category:Crime in Parwan Province Category:History of Balkh Province Category:History of Farah Province Category:History of Ghor Province Category:History of Khost Province Category:History of Laghman Province Category:History of Paktia Province Category:History of Paktika Province Category:History of Takhar Province May 2020 attacks Category:Mass murder in 2020 Category:Mass murder in Kabul Category:Mass shootings in Kabul Category:May 2020 crimes Category:May 2020 events in Afghanistan Category:Motorcycle bombings Category:Suicide bombings in 2020 May 2020 attacks Category:Taliban bombings May attacks ","title":"May 2020 Afghanistan attacks"},{"id":"63934685","text":"Raymond Vincent (born 1906, date of death unknown) was a French diver.

He graduated from high school in Budapest and studied violin, composition and music history at the conservatory there. He also took singing lessons and trained as a bass-baritone. In 1885 he moved to Vienna. In 1886 he undertook a study trip to America, where he worked as a musician and opera singer. In 1888 he finally settled in Vienna and worked for various Viennese newspapers as music critic. From 1894 to 1921 he was permanent music consultant for the ' and from 1914 to 1917 editor of the music magazine Der Merker. He advocated the nationalization of the Konservatorium Wien Privatuniversit√§t, the founding of the Volksoper and the construction of the Konzerthaus and was a well-known promoter of young talent. From 1923 he worked in the Bundestheater administration as a consultant for musical matters. Karpath worked with numerous composers, including Johannes Brahms, Pietro Mascagni, Giacomo Puccini, Gustav Mahler and his wife Alma, Max Reger and Siegfried and Cosima Wagner as well as musicians, such as Arthur Nikisch, Hans Richter and Felix Mottl. Richard Strauss dedicated his ballet Schlagobers to him in 1924. In several publications he dedicated himself to these persons. As gourmet he also published a cookbook.

A Wiegand Sensor. Wiegand sensors are magnetic sensors that do not need any external voltage or current, and make use of the Wiegand effect to generate a consistent pulse every time magnetic field polarity reverses. Wiegand sensors are made by wrapping a coil around a Vicalloy wire core, which, due to the hysteresis inherent in the Wiegand effect, induces a pulse in the coil each time the magnetic polarity of the Vicalloy wire core reverses. They can be used in a range of magnetic sensing applications and have the additional advantage that the energy of each pulse can be harvested. ==Energy Harvesting == The consistency of the pulses produced by Wiegand sensors can also be used to provide energy for ultra-low power electronics to be operated using a single pulse. In addition, successive pulses can be stored to offset energy demand of low-power energy circuits. Alternatively, the pulses can be used to trigger, or ‚Äòwake-up‚Äô, intermittently powered electronic circuits. In certain applications, both functions of the pulses (magnetic sensing and energy harvesting) are exploited. The pulse energy is used to power ultra-low power circuitry or ICs which, in turn, use the timing of the pulses to perform calculation tasks (e.g. count event data). ==Applications== Typical applications fall into three main categories; pulse generation applications, power transmission applications and combined sensing and energy harvesting applications. ===Pulse Generation=== As a reliable source of consistently timed pulses, Wiegand sensors are used in industrial and commercial flow-metering applications (e.g. water and gas), and also to calculate rotation speed in tachometers (e.g. high-speed trains). ===Power Transmission=== By placing the Wiegand sensor within an oscillating electro- magnetic fields (e.g. from a Helmholz coil), Wiegand sensors can be used to provide energy for low power applications in environments where high frequency transmission is challenging (e.g. transcutaneous power for medical devices). ===Sensing & Energy Harvesting=== Wiegand sensors are commonly used in ‚ÄòBatteryless‚Äô rotary encoder technology for self-powered revolution counting. Harnessing both the timing of the pulses and the pulse energy, such rotary encoders provide reliable multiturn counting even in the absence of external power or batteries. == References == Category:Magnetic devices ","title":"Wiegand Sensor"},{"id":"63934880","text":"Jussi Elo (6 January 1898 - 15 June 1957) was a Finnish diver.

June 1844 ‚Äì 9 April 1932). If so, they did not accompany him to Australia. Fellow- passengers included his business partner John Charles Lanyon, but also George Scarfe, who would years later be a partner, but whether he was known to the others is open to conjecture. Scarfe was not an emigrant at this stage; he would make a second voyage on the Frances Henty some four years later and their famous partnership a few years later still. Lanyon and Harris's first shipments arrived within a month and they set up shop as ironmongers at 43 Hindley Street opposite the \\"Black Bull\\" hotel. Their partnership was dissolved in March 1855, and Lanyon left South Australia by the barque Iris for London, where he started in business as a purchasing agent, servicing Harris and other Australian merchants. In 1864 Harris established a second store at Gawler Place, while Scotsman William Fraser and another employee, George Scarfe, ran the Hindley Street business as Scarfe & Fraser. They began selling off stock at discounted prices in March 1866 and the partnership was dissolved in August of that year, when it was revealed Harris had been a silent partner. Harris and Scarfe formed the partnership George P. Harris, Scarfe, & Co. in December 1866, at 58-60 Gawler Place, midway between Rundle and Grenfell streets, much later the site of Allan's music store. Around that time Richard Smith, their diligent salesman, was made a partner and their managing director. Harris and family left Adelaide by SS Balclutha on 14 January 1867, for Melbourne, and thence to London. He died six years later at \\"Castle House\\", Shooter's Hill, London. ==Other interests== *He was prominent in the 1864 establishment of the Jubilee Wesleyan Methodist church in Kent Town, and a dedicated worshipper and supporter.

Not long after this, Themistocles was ostracized and went into exile. Some scholars contend that \\"Aristobule\\" should not be globally conflated with Artemis, and outside Athens was a distinct divine concept in its own right. The philosopher Porphyry spoke of Aristobule as one known by this name alone (as opposed to a more surname-like epithet, \\"Artemis Aristobule\\"). Scholar Noel Robertson proposed that in Rhodes \\"Aristoboule\\" ought to be identified with the Roman Mother goddess, also known as Cybele. It has also been suggested by religion scholar Hermann Usener that \\"Aristobule\\" was a euphemism for capital punishment, and that this epithet and its temple had something to do with public executions, though other scholars disagree with this interpretation. This largely comes from speculation around the fact that in Athens the temple of Artemis Aristobule was very near to the place where the bodies of executed criminals who were denied interment (which was the ultimate punishment) were thrown into an open pit to rot. ==References== Category:Epithets of Artemis Category:Epithets of Cybele ","title":"Aristobule"},{"id":"63934988","text":"Ana Maria Rubio Zavala (born 21 February 1993) is a former Spanish Paralympic swimmer who competed in international level events.

He served as the chief sardar of Sylhet Sarkar from 1617 until 1620. ==Background== Mirak Bahadur Jalair was a Western Mongol or Chagatai Turk who belonged to the Jalair tribe. Many Jalairs migrated to the subcontinent where they served as high-ranking officials. Jalair had a fifteen-year-old slave called Suhayl. ==LifeDuring Akbar's reign=== Jalair accompanied Hussain Quli Beg in the hunt against Mirza Sharaf ad-Din at Ajmer. After Sharaf heard of the Mughal plot, he stationed his comrade Tarkhan Diwana and fled to Jalore. The Mughals managed to capture Ajmer in two to three days and made Diwana surrender. They then proceeded to Jalore. ===During Islam Khan's governorship=== Jalair was appointed by the Subahdar of Bengal, Islam Khan I, to join the army led by Shaykh Ghiyathuddin Inayat Khan against Khwaja Usman as well as the other various Baro-Bhuiyans and rebellious chieftain zamindars of Bengal. Jalair was living in the Chandrapratap Pargana. This large pargana was captured by rebels namely Mirza Mumin, Dariya Khan, Madhava Ray and Binud Ray (who pledged allegiance to Musa Khan, the leader of the Baro-Bhuiyans) after defeating Dilir Bahadur, the Mughal officer stationed there and aided by Ihtimam Khan's officers. The rebels believed that they could effortlessly also defeat Jalair to secure Chandrapratap to Musa Khan's domain once more. They readied a large naval fleet in addition to their land-force, infantry and cavalry in the early morning and attacked the Mughal Fort of Chandrapratap. Jalair defended the fort but the rebels had surrounded them and were very close in making the fort fall. News of this reached Tuqmaq Khan who was at Shahzadapur. Tuqmaq, leaving a force to defend Shahzadapur, ran to Bahadur's rescue with another force. The rebels had reached the gate of the Chandrapratap fort and were persecuting its inmates. Jalair's slave Suhayl led a group of people out of the fort. Outnumbered, they were heavily wounded. The fort was said to not have fallen due to Dariya Khan's near-sightedness. With the arrival of Tuqmaq and his forces, sounded by a trumpet, the rebels hopelessly fled. Jalair was then appointed to join the army alongside Shaykh Kamal and Tuqmaq Khan to Jahangirnagar, which they reached with great difficulty in six marches. They worked on establishing a fort here. Islam Khan I later ordered Jalair to go to the Mohana of the Kutharuiya (modern-day Kirtinasha, tributary of the Padma) bringing twenty war-boats with him. When Islam Khan reached Kutharuiya in the last pahar of the night, he took the twenty boats with him through the Isamati aiming to capture Jatrapur, to which he successfully did. Following this, Khan immediately ordered Jalair, as well as Shir Khan Tarin and Bayazid Khan Pani, to also cross the Isamati and secure the Mohana of Dakchara. Jalair and his associates were also successful in defeating the rebels at Dakchara that had put many obstacles at an attempt to stop the Mughals. The next expedition which Jalair took part in was to Kalakopa. Islam Khan I appointed him, Mubariz Khan and Tuqmaq Khan to be posted in the rear with ninety war-boats. Jalair was noted for his maturity when intervening in two quarrels emerged in both of these expeditions; the first being between Mirza Nathan and Iftikhar Khan over who is to be credited for the Dakchara victory in which Jalair brought about peace and the second being between Hakim Qudsi and Mirza Nathan on the behalf of Ihtimam Khan in which Jalair protected Qudsi from being \\"cut to pieces\\". After the surrender of Musa Khan in 1609, the next target rebel of the Mughal Empire was Khwaja Usman of Bokainagar, who was the leader of the Afghans in Bengal. Jalair and Abdur Razzaq Shirazi joined the leaders of this expedition, Shaykh Kamal and Shaykh Abdul Wahid, at Hasanpur (modern-day Haybatnagar). The army was instructed to build numerous forts, one every five days. At the eighteenth fort, Usman appeared with a small army to attack them. Shaykh Kamal ordered the Mughals not to respond and attempted to stop people from leaving the fort however many were tempted, including Jalair, by Usman and left the fort to fight him. The Mughals attained a victory by making use of the cannons at their fort and Usman's forces were heavily defeated. Usman and his men fled back to Bokainagar for safety. After the construction of the nineteenth fort, Jalair and his contemporaries took a break with the approach of the Islamic month of Ramadan in which they would observe fasting. The Mughals had a tradition in this month to have an iftar banquet in a different person's camp each day. Following the celebration of Eid al-Fitr, news had reached that Usman had evacuated his fort in Bokainagar with 250 men, fleeing to Sylhet after he heard that his allies, Dariya Khan Pani and Nasir Khan of Tajpur, had joined the Mughal forces. Following the Eid prayers, the army reached Bokainagar where they stopped, awaiting new commands following Usman's fleeing. Jalair joined the imperialists in the final battle against Khwaja Usman at Daulambapur in 1612. Jalair later took part in the expedition against Bayazid of Sylhet led by Shaykh Kamal. Under the chief command of Mukarram Khan, Jalair was also appointed to accompany the imperialists against Raja Parikshit of Koch Hajo in 1612. ===During Qasim Khan's governorship=== During the Subahdarship of Qasim Khan Chishti, Jalair, Mubariz and other thanadars were in Jahangirnagar, and not serving at their appointed thanas. The Subahdar was displeased by this behaviour and their persisting excuses, and sent a message to Emperor Jahangir of their misconduct. A reply was issued saying that Jalair was revoked of the title Bahadur and was now to be known as simply Mirak Jalair (and the same was done to the other thanadars). Jalair and Mubariz had already returned to their thana at Bundasil by this time, without hearing the reply from the Court. Due to this case, Qasim Khan ordered his bakhshi (paymaster), Khwaja Tahir Muhammad, to reinstate their titles and jagirs and to inform the imperial Court of this reformation. At Bundasil, Sardar Mubariz of Sylhet decided to lead an expedition with Jalair to Pratapgarh which was under the domain of the Raja of Kachar. During this expedition, they came across a tribe which lived in between the lands of the Khasis and the Kacharis, who referred to themselves as Mughals. The Mughal books claim that this tribe was indeed a descendant of the Turco-Mongol Timurids. They have said that during the reign of Timur in the late 12th century, the emperor had reached this extreme point and left a group of Mongols to protect the land before returning to his capital in Baghdad. Members of this tribe were white-skinned, spoke a Sino-Tibetan language, ate all sorts of animals and vegetables, and wore large turbans and big brass earrings (tunkal). They managed to defeat this tribe with a lot of difficulty, and annexed some of their land to the Mughal Empire. Some tribal members were sent alive to Qasim Khan. Mubariz returned to Sylhet thana and appointed Jalair to govern this new tribal area and to keep a lookout for trouble. Qasim Khan then sent these tribal people to the Emperor, who was pleased with the hard work of Jalair and his comrades and raised their ranks and wages.. The troops proceeded to the Kachari Kingdom, managing to defeat the Raja and establishing a fort and thana in Asurainagar. The Raja sent his envoy saying that he will give a tribute of 40 elephants, 100,000 rupees, and rare artefacts to Jahangir, 5 elephants and 20,000 rupees to Qasim as well as 2 elephants and 20,000 rupees for Mubariz and Mirak. After the death of Mubariz, Qasim Khan intended to appoint Jalair as the next Sardar of Sylhet. However, after learning that Jalair had fled from his appointed tribal territory which had recently been conquered with a lot of difficulty, Qasim was unimpressed at what he viewed as \\"cowardice\\". Qasim changed his mind and sent Officer Abdul Nabi to Yarasindur, where Mukarram Khan was staying with his brothers. Mukarram was brought to Jahangirnagar and Qasim Khan visited him in his own home to give him the honour of having sardarship over the entire Sylhet Sarkar as well as giving Mukarram's brothers lesser roles in Sylhet. Qasim Khan removed Mukarram Khan from his post as the Sardar of Sylhet out of dissatisfaction in 1617. Mukarram was replaced with Jalair, as Sylhet's chief sardar and Sulayman Banarsi to govern Uhar and Taraf. On 30 March 1620, Jalair was promoted as mansabdar of 1,000 soldiers and 200 horses. ==See also== *History of Bengal *History of Bangladesh *History of India *History of rulers of Bengal ==References== Category:Mughal nobility Category:Rulers of Sylhet Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1620 deaths Category:17th-century Indian people Category:17th-century rulers Category:17th-century Muslims Category:17th-century men ","title":"Mirak Bahadur Jalair"},{"id":"63935494","text":"Sylvie Blocher (born 1953) is a French artist.

The performance was recorded live at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, California on May 21, 1965. It is considered to be the world's first \\"jazz mass.\\" At Grace Cathedral was released on CD in 1997 by Fantasy under the title The Grace Cathedral Concert. ==Background== In an effort to make religious worship more approachable during the growing counterculture movement of the 1960s, the Reverend Charles Gompertz approached local jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi to create what he called a \\"modern setting for the choral Eucharist.\\" Guaraldi spent every Saturday over a period of 18 months rehearsing with the 68-voice St. Paul's Church of San Rafael choir to create a seamless blend of three unique elements for the performance: spoken (or chanted) prayers and greetings, vocals with the choir, and purely instrumental selections. Guaraldi understood the significance of his performance: \\"I had one of America's largest cathedrals as a setting, a top choir, and a critical audience that would be more than justified in finding fault. I was in a musical world that had lived with the Eucharist for 500-600 years, and I had to improve and/or update it to 20th-century musical standards. This was the most awesome and challenging thing I had ever attempted.\\" The album liner notes pointed out that audience members in attendance commented that \\"Theme For Grace\\" was reminiscent of supper music. Rev. Gompertz replied, \\"that's the idea. What does Communion represent but the Last Supper ‚Äî the last time these men ate together?\\" The song titles were chosen by Rev. Gompertz rather than Guaraldi at the behest of Fantasy Record executives. As the religious service was one long, uninterrupted performance, Fantasy asked Gompertz to divide the resulting recording into segments that would make sense in the context of a commercially released album. Guaraldi recruited several children from the St. Paul's Church of San Rafael choir several months later to record vocals for \\"Christmas Time Is Here\\", \\"My Little Drum\\" and \\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\\" for A Charlie Brown Christmas. ==Critical reception== AllMusic critic Richard S. Ginell commented that \\"Guaraldi's Mass fuses his mainstream and Latin strains comfortably and movingly underneath the plain vanilla Gregorian lines and Anglican plainchant of a 68-voice chorus.\\" Ginell added that \\"in a year that also saw Duke Ellington, Dave Brubeck and Lalo Schifrin write jazz-based pieces for the church, Vince Guaraldi may have come up with the most effective sacred work of the four.\\" All About Jazz critic Douglas Payne dubbed At Grace Cathedral \\"Peanuts Go To Church.\\" Payne added that most songs \\"employ Guaraldi's knack for pretty, childlike themes ‚Äî a perfect tone for the material.\\" ==Legacy== Guaraldi's jazz-infused performance at Grace Cathedral was considered groundbreaking for its time, being the first instance that a mainstream jazz musician was heard during an American church service. Several parishes across the United States celebrated the 50th anniversary of the event in 2015. Sacramento, California-based pianist Jim Martinez and his quartet recreated the jazz mass in its entirety at Grace Cathedral on August 15, 2015. The Fair Oaks Presbyterian Church Choir as well as several surviving members of the original St. Paul's Church of San Rafael choir who performed alongside Guaraldi in 1965 performed with Martinez for the event. The First Presbyterian Church of Clarks Summit in Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania, under the direction of Rev. Bill Carter, also honored the performance on September 6, 2015. Carter performed Guaraldi's keyboard parts with vocal support from members of the First Presbyterian adult choir. The tribute performance marked the first time that Guaraldi's jazz mass was presented in its entirety on the East coast. == Track listing == The following track listing is for the original 1965 vinyl release. == Personnel == ;The Vince Guaraldi Trio: *Vince Guaraldi ‚Äì piano *Tom Beeson ‚Äì bass *Lee Charlton ‚Äì drums ;Additional: * St. Paul's Church of San Rafael 68-voice choir ‚Äì choral chanting * Barry Mineah ‚Äì St. Paul's Church of San Rafael choral director * Reverend David A.

The old vestry hall had become the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell as \\"Camberwell Town Hall\\" in 1900. The new building was designed by Culpin and Bowers in the Classical style and built by Galbraith Brothers. It was officially opened by the mayor, Councillor S. E. Hall, on 10 October 1934. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with three bays facing onto Peckham Road; the central bay featured an arched doorway with a keystone in the form of the helm of a ship on the ground floor; there was a tall recess on the first, second and third floors flanked by four huge composite order antae with a clock and a pedestal above. Internally, the principal rooms were the council chamber and the mayor's parlour both on the first floor. The council chamber featured the original coved ceiling and pilastered walls, which had been recovered from the vestry hall, together with completely new seating furniture for the council members. The building took over the role of headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell and continued to be the local seat of government, when the enlarged London Borough of Southwark was formed in 1965. It then became known as \\"Southwark Town Hall\\" and benefited from some refurbishment works in the reception area in 1980. After the council moved to 160 Tooley Street in March 2009, the building was sold to a developer, Alumno Developments, in December 2014. Works to convert the property into student accommodation to a design by Jestico and Whiles for Goldsmiths College were completed in 2016. Memorials to council staff who had died in the First and Second World Wars were taken down during the works and transferred to Tooley Street. The works, which involved extending the building further north along Harvil Street, also facilitated provision of a new auditorium for \\"Theatre Peckham\\", which provides performing arts classes for young people, as well as a new caf√© and some self-contained artists' studios within the new complex. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Southwark Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1934 Category:1934 establishments in England ","title":"Camberwell Town Hall, London"},{"id":"63935520","text":"Branislav Nedimoviƒá (, born 27 November 1977) is a Serbian politician.

He was the fifth of six children in the family. In 1941, the Spu≈æiƒá family had to emigrate from Kosovo, deciding on ƒÜiƒáevac. While living in ƒÜiƒáevac at the very end of the war in 1945, he fell from a tree during a playground game and dislocated his hip. As a result, his left leg remained twenty-five centimetres shorter than his right leg. Due to that fracture, he had to wear a cast for eleven months after which he had to spend a lot of time in the Sremska Kamenica hospital and his education was late by a few years. From ƒÜiƒáevac, the family moved to Zemun and shortly after to Po≈æarevac where his father gained employment as a clerk in the Tax Administration. Spu≈æiƒá began singing and playing the accordion in Po≈æarevac using his neighbour's accordion. He was a member of the cultural arts society KUD Abra≈°eviƒá where he first received the nickname Kvaka thanks to his friend's mispronunciation in calling him a fakin (the Serbian language version of a guappo, usually translated as mangup). In the 1952‚Äì53 school year, he left high school and got his first job in the Dunav kafana in Veliko Gradi≈°te. There they bought him an accordion which he had to pay off by singing on the condition that he stays in the kafana until the debt is paid off. He also played Mexican songs. In 1968 in the Panƒçevo Army Hall, he met who at that time was already a known composer of folk music. Jovanoviƒá offered him to record a single with four songs. The single was recorded by Zagreb-based Jugoton. It sold 400,000 copies and had a silver and gold publication. In the Summer of 1968, the director of Beogradska estrada Rade Mumin offered him a contract. He had his first serious appearance that same year in the Dom Sindikata in Belgrade with the song Poƒëimo u krƒçmu staru. In Autumn of that same year, he competed in the festival in Sokobanja where the audience awarded him first place. In 1970, he recorded his second single and at the Ilid≈æa '69 Festival where the expert jury co-awarded him and Nada Mamula first place. His first album was published in 1971 by Jugoton. The album contained the songs from his first five singles. He lived a bohemian lifestyle, earning and spending money quickly. He enjoyed the company of women and kafanas and married four times. His popularity rose quickly ‚Äì reaching the top ‚Äì but decreased gradually over time. He published twenty-three singles, sixteen albums and three CD-s. He held his last concert in 1996. In 1997, he had a stroke which robbed him of using the entire right side of his body and speaking ability. He managed to recover thanks to Hanka Paldum who brought him to Sarajevo and financed the expenses of his recovery. In March 1998, a large humanitarian concert was held in the Po≈æarevac Sports Hall and all benefits went towards Spu≈æiƒá's recovery. The most responsible for this concert were Zoran Kaleziƒá and Zorica Brunclik. Spu≈æiƒá died on 9 March 2002 in Po≈æarevac. He was interred on 11 March 2002 at the Po≈æarevac Old Cemetery.

The windows and door start moving and the house take the shape of a face. A traveller enters the hotel and things start to move by themselves. A waiter brings the dinner and, on the table, the bread is cut by a knife moving by itself and coffee and sugar are served without human intervention. A small figure comes out of the milk jug to pour the milk in the cup before returning to the jug. The flabbergasted guest brings out of the jug a napkin which starts dancing by itself and, when he finally catches it, it turns into a sheet. The man finally goes to bed. The room starts turning around. The film ends with a big monster appearing behind the bed and catching into his huge hands the traveler and his blanket. ==Cast== Paul Panzer as The Traveller William V.

In gratitude, the King asks Sissa how he wants to be rewarded. Sissa wishes to receive an amount of grain which is the sum of one grain on the first square of the chess board, and which is then doubled on every following square.The Universal Magazine of Knowledge and Pleasure (1797),, \\"Origin of the Game of Chess\\", pp400-1 This request is now known as the Wheat and Chessboard Problem, and forms the basis of various mathematical and philosophical questions. === Historical origin === Until the nineteenth century, the legend of Sissa was one of several theories about the origin of chess. Today it is mainly regarded as a myth because there is no clear picture of the origin of chaturanga (an ancient Indian chess game), and from which modern chess has developed. The context of the mythical Sissa is described in detail in A History of Chess. There are many variations and inconsistencies, and therefore little can be confirmed historically. Nevertheless, the legend of Sissa is placed by most sources in a Hindu kingdom between 400 and 600 AD, in an era after the invasion of Alexander the Great. The myth is often told from a Persian and Islamic perspective.Murray, H.J.R. (1913), A history of chess, Oxford. However, the oldest known narrative believed to have been the basis for the legend of Sissa is from before the Islam. It tells of Husiya, daughter of Balhait, a queen whose son is killed by a rebel, but of whom she does not initially hear the news. This news is subtly announced to her through the chess game that Sissa introduced to her.Gordon et al (ed., 2018) The Works of Ibn Wadih Al-Yaqubi, Brill, pp.354-357 == Sources == This article has been created by partial adoption from and translation of the Dutch Wikipedia Sissa (Mythische Brahmaan).

It aired on September 23, 2016. The story for the episode was written by Peter M. Lenkov and Paul Downs Colaizzo. The teleplay was also written by Peter M. Lenkov. The episode was directed by James Wan. ==Plot== Angus \\"Mac\\" MacGyver, with help from Jack Dalton and Nikki Carpenter, infiltrates a party to steal a biological weapon. As Mac and Jack meet up with Nikki, they find her held hostage by John Kendrick. Mac gives up the bio- weapon, but Kendrick shoots both him and Nikki, killing her. Three months later, Mac is on holiday when his boss, Patricia Thornton of the Department of External Services (DXS), calls him and Jack back to help retrieve the bio- weapon. They recruit convicted hacker Riley Davis, who tracks Kendrick to San Francisco, where they also discover that Nikki is alive and working with him. After capturing them, Mac finds out that Nikki has sold the bio-weapon to someone who plans on making it airborne via an IED. Mac finds the bio-weapon and extracts it from the IED before it explodes. A few days later, Thornton tells the group that Nikki's betrayal caused the DXS to become public, so they have to shut down and relocate under a new name. Mac chooses the name Phoenix, to which the rest of the group agrees. Nikki is arrested by the FBI but disappears during transport, leaving the cuffs behind with a hairpin. ==Production== The series was first announced as being in development on October 2, 2015, with R. Scott Gemmill, James Wan, Henry Winkler, and Michael Clear. On February 2, 2016, the series was given the green light to produce a pilot, with Paul Downs Colaizzo replacing Gemmill as writer. On March 8, 2016, David Von Ancken replaced Wan as the director of the pilot. On May 13, 2016, CBS ordered the series, and Peter M. Lenkov replaced Colaizzo and Brett Mahoney as showrunner.

It is located opposite the Supreme Court of Appeal in President Brand Street. In the early 1880s, it was resolved to build a new presidency office and chamber council. The designs for both buildings were awarded to Johannesburg-based Lennox Canning. The new presidency office was completed in 1886, yet work on the chamber council had not begun until 1889 when a tender of ¬£27,183.10 was accepted by another Johannesburg-based architect, TR Robertson. President Francis William Reitz laid the foundation stone on 27 June 1890. Due to construction issues, another tender of ¬£12,500 was awarded to JJ Kirkness. The new building was formally inaugurated on 5 June 1893 when the members walked from the old chamber to the new one. A further ¬£4,000 were spent on internal furnishings over the following years. In March 1900, British forces occupied Bloemfontein and the building became a military hospital. Most of the furnishing were acquired and are now in private homes. The Orange River Colony became the legitimate government in 1907. The colony had a two-chamber legislature consisting of a council and a legislative assembly. The lower council continued to meet in the Raadsaal, while a separate building facing Aliwal Street housed the upper house. In 1910, the Union of South Africa, was formed and the Raadsaal housed the provincial council. The chamber and its rooms were occupied by the Appeal Court until its own premises was ultimately built in 1929. After the first non-racial elections in 1994, a decision was taken to house the newly-established provincial legislature in the building. ==References== ==External links== *Free State Legislature - Fourth Raadsaal Category:Buildings and structures in Bloemfontein Category:Bloemfontein Category:Free State (province) Category:Seats of national legislatures Category:Legislative buildings Category:Afrikaans words and phrases ","title":"Fourth Raadsaal"},{"id":"63935657","text":"Landet is a small town located on the island of T√•singe in south-central Denmark, in Svendborg Municipality.

He was among the founding figures of genetics within the early days of the Soviet Union and held a high status within the communist party but when Soviet genetics entered a power struggle, he was targeted for his ideas in eugenics which led to the sidelining of his career although he was not executed like several other geneticists during the purges under Stalin. Serebrovsky is credited with defining the term genofond from which the English term gene pool is derived. He was also the pioneer of the theory on which the sterile male technique of pest management is based. == Life and work == Serebrovsky was born in Tula in a well-connected family. His father Sergei Mitrofanovich had trained in art and was an architect in Kursk while his mother Julia Dmitrievna was from Livny. The family were friends of A.A. Bogdanov and A.V. Lunacharsky. Alexander studied at the Tula Realschule and then went to study at Moscow University, graduating in 1914. He then studied at the Shaniavsky Free Public University under Nikolai Koltsov. He was conscripted in World War I and fought on the Caucasus front in 1916 and after demobilization he worked briefly at the zoo and then worked in a poultry breeding station in Slobodka near Tula. After Koltsov rose in position and founded the Institute of Experimental Biology in 1917, his patronage helped Serebrovsky to study poultry genetics from around 1918. He took special interest in the conservation of the Orloff and Pavlov breeds of chicken. His research station was the Anikovo Genetics Station of Narkomzem in Zvenigorod uezd about 60 km from Moscow and he headed the station from 1921 to 1923. From 1923‚Äì1930 he taught at the Moscow Zootechnical Institute while also collaborating with other Moscow geneticists like S.S. Chetverikov. Serebrovsky also worked with S.G. Navashin at the Timiryazev Biological Institute where he helped develop a laboratory in 1929 where he developed the idea of \\"step-allelomorphism\\" (or \\"step-alleles\\", pseudo alleles that represent closely located loci on a chromosome that act as a single module.) In 1926 he also suggested the need for a synthesis of Darwinism and genetics. He was responsible for a shift in Solomon Levit from Lamarckism to Mendelism. In 1929 Serebrovsky wrote a book Anthropogenetics and Eugenics in a Socialist Society (–ê–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ç–∏–∫–∞ –∏ –µ–≤–≥–µ–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –≤ —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ) in which he suggested that the use of artificial insemination with sperm obtained from carefully chosen men would help society under socialism unlike the negative eugenics that the western world considered. He suggested that true socialism would involve the separation of love and reproduction. This, and his support for inheritance of characters, along with a rejection of Lamarckism, were to lead to his downfall. One of Serebrovsky's students was Nikolay Dubinin who rose rapidly in political power. Despite an attempt to repent for his mistakes, Serebrovsky came under attack in the 1930s from several quarters including Dubinin. He was castigated for \\"Menshevizing idealism.\\" Serebrovsky, Koltsov, and Filipchenko were targeted as eugenicists with fascist ideology. These matters were made worse when Hermann Muller wrote his book on eugenics and sent them to Stalin. Dubinin was keen to prevent the perversion of science by the \\"scum of ideas of Lotsy, DeVries, Morgan, Serebrovsky, Filipchencko, and others.\\" Serebrovsky fired Dubinin from the institute and Serebrovsky's laboratory was closed in 1932. Dubinin and Lysenko both targetted Koltsov and this led to Koltsov being removed from his institute and possibly assassinated. Serebrovsky clashed with Trofim Lysenko calling him mrakobes, an expletive meaning (\\"obscurantist\\") at meetings in 1935 and 1936. Lysenko claimed that racism and fascism were part of the philosophy of genetics. Serebrovsky became a recluse and in 1938 published a note on the idea of using sterile males for biological control of pests. It was published in 1940 but several of his works remained unpublished. He died at a sanatorium in Moscow. == References == == External links == * Biography Category:Soviet geneticists Category:1892 births Category:1948 deaths ","title":"Alexander Sergeevich Serebrovsky"},{"id":"63935716","text":"John Gibb of Knock and Carribber (c.1550-1628) was a Scottish landowner and courtier.

He was however a kinsman of the Master of Work, William Schaw and Elizabeth Schaw, Countess of Annandale. His home, Carribber, is near Linlithgow.

The tennis court for James VI at Stirling Castle had been constructed from timber in June 1576.Charles Thorpe McInnes, Accounts of the Treasurer: 1574-1580, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1978), pp. 131, 307. In October 1582 he met Walter Keyre at Leith, a messenger from the Duke of Lennox who was staying at Rothesay Castle, displaced from his favour at court by the Gowrie Regime. James VI spoke to Gibb privately about the meeting in the \\"stole\\" or garderobe at Holyrood Palace.

His death sentence was converted to banishment.George Duncan Gibb, Life and Times of Robert Gib, Lord of Carriber, vol. 1 (London, 1874), pp. 223-230 citing National Archives of Scotland RD1/33, pp. 472-473: Robert Pitcairn, Ancient Criminal Trials (Edinburgh, 1833), pp. 187-9. ==Royal textiles and jewels== In April 1584 John Gibb delivered a royal jewel, a tablet or locket with a diamond and an emerald, to Alexander Clark of Balbirnie, Provost of Edinburgh, as a pledge for a loan of 6,000 merks.Thomas Thomson, Collection of Inventories (Edinburgh, 1815), pp. 310-12: John Marwick, Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1573-1589 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 336. In October 1589 the Provost John Arnot formally gave the jewel back to the king as a marriage gift.David Masson, Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland: 1585-1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), p. 420. It was delivered by Clerk's son-in-law John Provand to William Fairlie, who commissioned the goldsmith David Gilbert to upgrade and refashion it, and it was presented to Anne of Denmark during her Entry to Edinburgh in May 1590.Marguerite Wood, Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1589-1603, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 7. Gibb was in charge of jewels in the king's use, and in October 1584 transferred several pieces to the keeping of the Master of the Wardrobe, Patrick, Master of Gray. Some of the jewels had recently been in the possession of Colonel William Stewart. One tablet or locket had been a gift from the Laird of Rosyth. A little hat badge with diamonds and sparks of rubies was a recent present from Queen Elizabeth. A diamond cross was one of the jewels of Mary, Queen of Scots.Thomas Thomson, Collection of Inventories (Edinburgh, 1815), pp. 314-16. The grooms and valets of the chamber were also in charge of the king's linen. In October 1590 he was paid for ruffs, napkins, shirts, caps called \\"mutches\\", and sheets supplied to the king since 1588. These were embroidered with gold and silver thread and edges with \\"shorn work\\". His sister, Elspeth or Elizabeth Gibb made the shirts and ruffs.National Records of Scotland, treasurer's accounts, October 1590. In 1591 linen was delivered to Gibb for the cuffs \\"handis\\" and \\"neckis\\" of the king's shirts, and in August he provided livery clothes for Danish servants of Anne of Denmark who were returning home.George Duncan Gibb, Life and times of Robert Gib, Lord of Carriber, vol. 1 (London, 1874), p. 327. The treasurer's accounts for May 1599 list textiles in the keeping of Gibb and George Murray, including linen for shirts, cuffs, bands, bedsheets, tablecloths, night-caps to be embroidered with gold and red and blue silks, napkins, and a taffeta pocket or bag of powder to scent the linen chest.George Duncan Gibb, Life and times of Robert Gib, Lord of Carriber, vol. 1 (London, 1874), pp. 340-2 Gibb's sister Elizabeth had a similar role in Anne of Denmark's household.Jemma Field, 'Dressing a Queen: The Wardrobe of Anna of Denmark at the Scottish Court of King James VI, 1590‚Äì1603', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019), pp. 160-3. John Tennent had performed a similar role for James V in the 1530s.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer: 1531-1538, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 256. In August 1591 Gibb was given ¬£240 to buy clothes for Danish servants of Anne of Denmark who were returning home.Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), p. 133. The king also bought clothes for John Gibb, including in February 1591 a cloak of black Naples taffeta, and a black satin doublet with black velvet breeches.National Records of Scotland, E35/13 f.13r, account of Robert Jousie. ==Letters and messages at court== John Gibb continued as a servant in the bedchamber in England after the Union of the Crowns. Gibb was the messenger who brought reprieves from the death sentence for Markham, Grey, and Cobham at Winchester. On 24 October Gibb, John Auchmoutie, John Murray, and George Murray, grooms of the bedchamber were given winter clothing.George Duncan Gibb, Life and times of Robert Gib, Lord of Carriber, vol. 2 (London, 1874), pp. 2, 13. As a member of the king's chamber Gibb was able to forward the business of petitioners. In 1607 Maurice Peeters complained to Robert Cecil that his plan for reforming the manufacture of fabrics in England made from Persian bombazine cotton without wool, and his patent for silk dyeing had been forwarded by Gibb, but then Gibb took it up with other partners and promoted it to the king, to the loss, Peeters claimed, of Cecil and Anne of Denmark.M. S. Giuseppi & David McN. Lockie, HMC Salisbury Hatfield, 19 (London, 1965), p. 450. ===Henry Gibb=== His younger son Henry Gibb also had a bedchamber position. He was first a groom of the bedchamber to Prince Henry.George Duncan Gibb, Life and times of Robert Gib, Lord of Carriber, vol. 2 (London, 1874), pp. 42, 100. John Gibb obtained the lands of Kilcroft and Carriber and transferred them to Henry Gibb.Gordon MacGregor, 'Gibb of Carriber', Red Book of Scotland, vol. 4 (2020), pp. 512. In September 1613 Henry Gibb and Mr May travelled to Veere and Sluis to prevent Henry Howard, a son of the Earl of Suffolk fighting a duel with the Earl of Essex over issues concerning his sister Frances Howard and the annulment of her marriage.William Shaw & G. Dyfnallt Owen, HMC 77 Viscount De L'Isle, Penshurst, vol. 5 (London, 1961), pp. 120-3.HMC Mar & Kellie, vol. 2 (London, 1930), p. 54. Young Gibb was part of an incident in 1615 connected with the fall of the Scottish favourite, Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, who had married Frances Howard. He passed a letter and message from Somerset's message to Anne of Denmark's servant, his kinswoman Elizabeth Schaw, Mrs Murray. This caused the queen offence and difficulties for Scottish courtiers including Schaw's husband John Murray of the Bedchamber. The Countess of Eglinton heard about the affair and she wrote to the Murrays about Somerset, who she described as the \\"errant liar\\", who \\"wret to you and message sent with that ungret fullich cousing of yours, Herie Gib.\\" He lost his place at court for a while.James Maidment, Letters and State Papers of James the Sixth (Edinburgh, 1838), pp. 289-91, now NLS Adv. MS 33.1.1 vol. 10 no. 120: Thomas Birch (Folkestone Williams), Court and Times of James the First vol. 1 (London, 1848), p. 367 The early biographer of King James Arthur Wilson has a version of these events, saying the letter or message carried by Henry Gibb was intended for King James. It came from a Scottish man called Lumsden and described the actions of Richard Weston, the keeper of the Tower of London, and was critical of the lawyer Edward Coke. Francis Bacon said it was a libel and slander,George Duncan Gibb, Life and times of Robert Gib, Lord of Carriber, vol. 2 (London, 1874), pp. 131-3: Arthur Wilson, The History of Great Britain: Being the Life and Reign of King James the First (London, 1653), pp. 81-88. ===John Gibb humiliated at court=== In April 1616 John Gibb was questioned with Sir Robert Kerr about missing letters and documents and they were placed in the custody of Sir James Fullerton.Norman Egbert McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 1 (Philadelphia, 1939), pp. 609, 625-6. According to an old story, at Theobalds in 1622 the king had misplaced some papers relating to a Spanish treaty, and became angry and frustrated, and insisted that John Gibb had them. Gibb threw himself on the floor saying he had never had the papers, and James kicked him. Gibb abandoned his humility and said wouldn't put up with it any more, and rode away to London. Endymion Porter hearing of this remembered he had the documents. James sent messengers to bring Gibb back to Theobalds and kneeled in front of his servant to beg forgiveness. The incident was an illustration of the imbalance in the king's humours for the biographer Arthur Wilson.Arthur Wilson, The History of Great Britain: Being the Life and Reign of King James the First (London, 1653), p. 219. Thomas Middleton made this affair into a stage play as The Nice Valour, in which the Duke whips a courtier, Shamont, in the face, but later apologises and devotes himself to justice. The scene would read as a compliment to the king.Swapan Chakravorty, Society and Politics in the Plays of Thomas Middleton (Oxford, 1996), pp. 112-3. In 1618 John Taylor, the Water Poet, came to Dunfermline and lodged at John Gibb's house, presumably part of the palace. Taylor said Gibb, who was not there, was \\"the oldest servant the king hath.\\" A Mr Crighton showed Taylor around the palace.John Taylor, 'Pennilesse Pilgrimage', All the Workes of John Taylor, the Water Poet (London, 1630), p. 132. He died on 6 February 1628 and was buried in Dunfermline Abbey churchyard.George Duncan Gibb, Life and times of Robert Gib, Lord of Carriber, vol. 2 (London, 1874), p. 88. ==Family and children== John Gibb married Isobella Lindsay. Their children included:Gordon MacGregor, 'Gibb of Carriber', Red Book of Scotland, vol. 4 (2020), pp. 511-4. * James Gibb of Carriber, who married Egidia Abercromby.

John Gibb's sister, Elizabeth Gibb, married the king's tutor Peter Young in 1577. She became a gentlewoman in the household of Anna of Denmark and made head coverings and veils for riding for the queen.Jemma Field, 'Dressing a Queen: The Wardrobe of Anna of Denmark at the Scottish Court of King James VI, 1590‚Äì1603', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019), pp. 160-3.

Alex started playing piano at age six, taking lessons from several of the most important keyboard players of the era, including Leonard \\"Baby Doo\\" Caston, Willie's former partner in the Big Three Trio; Lafayette Leake, a longtime member of the Muddy Waters Band; Eurreal Little Brother Montgomery, a self-taught innovator whose career began in the 1920s; and his uncle, Arthur \\"Butch\\" Dixon, who toured for years with Willie as a member of his Chicago Blues All- Stars. At age seven, Alex began performing with his grandfather at schools across the South Side of Chicago in an effort to bring the music to a new, younger audience. Alex played in several different styles as Willie introduced the youngsters to the blues and its history through spoken word and song. Their efforts laid the groundwork for what has become the Blues In The Schools program, an effort that now spans the globe. When Willie and Marie relocated to the Los Angeles area in 1984, their grandson moved with them. When he was age 11, Willie began indoctrinating him in the family business and continuing to indoctrinate children to the music by appearing with him at local schools, work that later resulted in Alex becoming a member of his touring band for club and festival bookings. Alex shares songwriting credit with his grandfather on 40 tunes, including \\"Study War No More,\\" which appeared on Dixon's final album, the Grammy-winning \\"Hidden Charms.\\" == Professional life == After Willie's death, Alex served as a deputy with the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department for seven years and graduated from Aspen University in 2009 with a degree in criminal justice/law enforcement administration. He retired from the force to resume a career in music after an off-duty incident involving an ex-convict gang member who shot at him two or three times without hitting his mark and who was subsequently convicted of first-degree murder in the death of a former roommate. A past vice president of Blues Heaven Foundation, the non-profit organization Willie initiated in 1984, Alex supervised efforts to promote the music and award scholarships to younger musicians, delivering emergency assistance to older artists experiencing life crises and working in their behalf to recoup royalties for their recorded and published works. He founded Dixon Landing Music‚Äîa combined recording label, publishing house and management firm‚Äîin Los Angeles in 1989 in an effort to continue his grandfather's legacy in promoting the careers of younger artists. Offices have been based in the San Francisco Bay area since his family relocated in 2012. He also assumed responsibilities as chief executive of Hoochie Coochie Music, which oversees his grandfather's extensive songwriting legacy, in 2016 following the passing of his grandmother. == Recording career == The Blues Experience with Cash McCall -- \\"The Vintage Room\\" (Dixon Landing Music 2007) The first release on the Dixon Landing imprint, this collection of post-War blues featured the voice and guitar of Cash McCall, a blues and soul blues artist who worked frequently with Willie Dixon and was a longtime studio musician for Chess Records, Alex on keyboards and harmonica stylings from Steve Bell, the son of Chicago harp stalwart Carey Bell, and other young musicians. The 11 tracks‚Äîseven penned by Alex, three by Willie and one by McCall‚Äîconveyed the traditional sound established by the elder Dixon. The Alex Dixon Band -- \\"Rising From The Bushes\\" (Dixon Landing Music 2009) A blues-rock release, this album opens and closes with short spoken-word segments from Willie Dixon. Alex contributes keyboards with vocals handled by soprano Marcy Levy, aka Marcella Detroit, who co-wrote \\"Lay Down Sally\\" with Eric Clapton, as well as guitarist Alan Mirikitani, front man of the Los Angeles-based band BB Chung King and the Buddaheads. The lineup also included longtime Steve Miller Band bassist Gerald Johnson and percussionists James Gadsen, who previously recorded with Aretha Franklin and Aaron Neville, and Alvino Bennett, a longtime member of Koko Taylor & Her Blues Machine. Alex Dixon Presents...\\"The Real McCoy Featuring Lewis 'Big Lew' Powell\\" (Dixon Landing Music 2020) Dixon returns to his blues roots for this CD, which features contributions from Sugar Blue, the Grammy Award-winning harmonica player who was a former member of Willie's Chicago Blues Allstars, and marks the debut as a front man for Lewis \\"Big Lew\\" Powell, best known as the percussionist for Chicago vocalist Nellie \\"Tiger\\" Travis. A collection of traditional Chicago blues, it includes seven originals penned by Alex and three covers written by his grandfather. The lineup includes Bennett and Bell along with guitarists Melvin Taylor, Gino Matteo, Rico McFarland and Joey Delgado with Dixon on electric and upright bass and piano with Australian vocalist Whaia and Dixon's daughter, Leila, providing backing vocals. == Awards and honors == On April 28, 2013, both Willie Dixon and Alex Dixon were enshrined as members of the Chicago Blues Hall of Fame. The ceremonies were conducted at Buddy Guy's nightclub, Legends. On June 15, 2015, Alex performed as a headliner at the Chicago Blues Festival along with McCall, Sugar Blue and other members of the Dixon family as part of its Willie Dixon Centennial Tribute. ==References== Category:American blues musicians Category:1975 births Category:Living people ","title":"Alex Dixon (blues)"},{"id":"63936102","text":"Saab 37 Viggen Space Shuttle in atmospheric flight has taken ground and the brake parachute has fallen out Bertil Dillner (12 May 1923 in Lit J√§mtland, Sweden - 9 May 2015 in Link√∂ping) was a Swedish Aeronautical engineer Graduation work jobb KTH: Examination of wing profiles for model aircraft at low Reynolds number and aerodynamic expert.

As ridership increases along the corridor and consistent delays on the DC Streetcar, WMATA proposed a brand new route X9 to operate between Capitol Heights station and Metro Center station. This was to reduce crowding during the weekday peak-hours and to replace route X3. On December 19, 2010, route X9 was introduce as a new express bus route to primarily operate along H Street, Benning Road and Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue.

This proposed was in part to customer demand and requests and jurisdictional coordination and responds to requests by the District Department of Transportation. Route X9 will provides additional limited-stop capacity to accommodate new riders in the Benning Road-H Street corridor during the weekday midday to help route X2 and provide a weekday midday transfer-free ride throughout the entire corridor on proposed Route X9 between downtown DC and Capitol Heights station. This proposal was also recommended in the 2010 Benning Road-H Street Lines Service Evaluation Study. ===2018 Service Changes=== On June 24, 2018, route X9 was given new weekday midday service which will operate every 15 minutes between Minnesota Avenue station and Metro Center station. Differences in the routing was route X9 will enter the Minnesota Avenue bus bays during the midday hours while during weekday peak-hours, the route would serve the on-street bus stop at Minnesota Avenue. ==References== Category:2010 establishments in Washington, D.C.

Family campaigning had led to coroners investigations in 2012 and 2015 that recommended that police reopen the case. No action was taken until 2017 when a coroner found that Johnson had died as a result of a hate crime. Police offered an A$1million reward in 2018 for information. His family raised the reward to A$2million in March 2020. The conclusion that Johnson's death was the result of a hate crime drew attention to other homophobic killings around Sydney beaches in the 1980s. It is now estimated that as many as 80 gay men were murdered in Sydney in the late 1980s, many pushed off cliffs. The New South Wales Police Force has since apologised for not investigating the murder of Johnson properly and failing to protect the gay community. ==2020 arrest== On 12 May 2020, a 49-year-old man was arrested ln Lane Cove and charged with the murder of Johnson. After being contacted about the arrest, Steve Johnson said: \\"This is a very emotional day, he was my best friend and he really needed me to do this.\\" Steve Johnson also hopes that the arrest will open the doors for others to receive justice. He said, \\"I hope the family and friends of the other dozens of gay men who lost their lives find solace in what's happened today\\". ==References== Category:1988 deaths Category:American people murdered abroad Category:Gay academics Category:Male murder victims Category:1980s murders in Australia Category:1988 crimes in Australia Category:Violence against LGBT people ","title":"Death of Scott Johnson"},{"id":"63936279","text":"Raymond W.

He was awarded the Navy Cross during World War II, and after the war he served as a state politician in Oregon. == Early life == Warren C. Gill was born on December 31, 1912, in Lebanon, Oregon. After graduating from high school in Lebanon, he attended the University of Oregon, where he was a member of the football and swimming teams. Earning a law degree, Gill subsequently passed the Oregon bar exam and got a job at a maritime law firm in New York City. == Coast Guard career  Early service === In December 1941, Gill met his future wife, Vadne Scott, at a concert she was performing at. They married soon after in January 1942, and several days after the wedding, Gill enlisted into the Coast Guard Reserve. He was then commissioned as an ensign, and by August 1942 he was serving aboard the USS Samuel Chase as the Assistant Beach Officer. In November, Ensign Gill participated in Operation Torch, overseeing the amphibious landing at Morocco. In July 1943, he commanded a flotilla of landing boats which landed elements of the Seventh Army in Gela, Sicily, during Operation Husky. Gill was awarded the Legion of Merit and earned a promotion to lieutenant (junior grade) for his leadership at Sicily. === Navy Cross action === By September 1943, Lieutenant Gill was given command of the small boats aboard the USS LST-357. On September 9, USS LST-357 was participating in Operation Avalanche at Salerno, Italy, when a German 88mm shell struck the ship. The shell hit Gill's landing craft, wounding Gill along with several other crew members and 25 soldiers. The Coast Guardsman who was standing next to Gill was killed. Gill, who was critically wounded in the back and chest, was given a blood transfusion by the medical officer on the ship. However, he refused morphine and stayed at his post to command the assault flotillas and gave crucial instructions to his men. Upon hearing the landing boats had reached the beaches, Gill collapsed from his wounds. Lieutenant Gill was evacuated from the ship and spent the next three months at a British hospital in North Africa. Upon being transferred to a hospital in Algiers, Algeria, Gill was presented the Navy Cross by Vice Admiral Henry K. Hewitt for his actions at Salerno. Gill is one of just six Coast Guardsmen to be awarded the Navy Cross during World War II. === Later service === Gill was later sent to the Long Beach Navy Hospital in California. He spent 20 months both at the hospital and participating in war bond campaigns throughout Southern California. He underwent numerous surgeries which removed shrapnel from his body, however, some of the shrapnel was never removed. Gill was discharged from active duty on August 20, 1945. Because of his wounds, Gill was medically retired on April 1, 1946 and advanced to the rank of lieutenant commander. == Post-war life == Gill returned to his hometown of Lebanon to practice law. From 1949 to 1951, he represented State District 13 in the Oregon House of Representatives. From 1951 to 1959, Gill served as an Oregon State Senator from State District 2. In 1958, he lost the Republican nomination for governor to Mark Hatfield, and he subsequently retired from politics. In 1961, Gill became the city attorney of Lebanon. He later built boats and began hydroplane racing. In 1975, he joined the Coast Guard Auxiliary, serving a year as the commander of the Albany Flotilla. Warren C. Gill was killed in a homemade autogyro crash in Lebanon on October 8, 1987. He was buried in the Independent Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF) Cemetery in Lebanon. == References == Category:1912 births Category:1987 deaths Category:20th-century American politicians Category:Members of the Oregon House of Representatives Category:Military personnel from Oregon Category:Oregon city attorneys Category:Oregon lawyers Category:Oregon Republicans Category:Oregon state senators Category:People from Lebanon, Oregon Category:Recipients of the Navy Cross (United States) Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:United States Coast Guard officers Category:United States Coast Guard personnel of World War II Category:United States Coast Guard reservists ","title":"Warren C.

Although they were exterminated by fear of their power, some of them survived through the centuries, hoping to recover their power by summoning the Four Holy Beasts in human bodies. Their last attempt, performed by esotericists in the Mount Koya, was stopped in 1971 by one of their own creations, a monk with the power of Genbu named Gendo. In 1989, two party girls in Shinjuku, Tokyo, Tomoyo and Hiroko, are attacked by a mysterious cult seeking the incarnation of Suzaku, but Gendo arrives to the city in time to save the latter. Next morning, young artist Kyoichi Hiyu is mysteriously approached by the leader of the cult, Miki Chiyoe, who has learned Hiyu is the incarnation of Byakko. Kyoichi meets with Gendo, his former master, and is informed that the forces of Seiryu are seeking all the four beasts to exploit their power, as well as that Miki is the son of the previous Seiryu incarnation, Toshiro Chiyoe, who was slain by Gendo himself. Under the suspicion that Hiyu's girlfriend Shiho might be the last beast, Suzaku, Kyoichi and Gendo go meet her, but on the road they find a team sent by Miki with the same mission. While Gendo kills enemy commander Sakaki in a duel of grotesque powers, Kyoichi rushes to Shiho's house, only to find Miki already there. A fight ensues in which both Kyoichi and Miki are seemingly killed. Some time later, while staying in a safe temple, Shiho feels Kyoichi is still alive in Tokyo, having only lost control of his power. Gendo and Shiho search for him, meeting again with Chiyoe forces under the command of new lieutenant Mukuri, but they are saved by a duo of monk fighters, Ryora and Kinshi, sent as reinforcements from allies in the Mount Koya. Those manage to find and subdue the now animalistic Kyoichi, only for an intruding Mukuri to kidnap Shiho and unveil a mutated Tomoyo as one of his soldiers. She wounds Gendo and fights off Ryora and Kinshi, but Kyoichi finally comes to senses and saves his allies by brutally defeating her. Tomoyo's severed head informs them with her last words that Miki Chiyoe will perform a grand ritual in Shinjuku in order to hijack Shiho's power, so they resolve to crash it. On the way to Shinjuku, the heroes are attacked by zombified citizens sent by Chiyoe. Meanwhile Miki, who has now an androgynous body as a consequence of his battle with Kyoichi, seduces Shiho and taunts Kyoichi with images of their intercourse. Gendo fights an inequal battle with a mutant Mukuri while Kyoichi and the monk duo assault the Shinjuku temple, where more mutants and creatures attack them. Tamaki, a female servant of Miki, captures Kinshu and forces Ryora to stay behind to destroy her, after which Kyoichi and Gendo find Chiyoe, who has stolen Shiho's soul. Kyoichi is defeated by Miki, who then reveals Gendo actually died in battle against Toshiro and was a reanimated pawn of the Chiyoe family all the time. Seeing Gendo dead, Kyoichi continues battling hopelessly against Miki, but this time Shiho's soul intervenes to turn against Chiyoe. The temple is destroyed and all of them die, with Kyoichi hoping that he and Shihu will be together in their next life. ==Characters== ; : The series' protagonist, a young artist who also practices martial arts.

The latter bought the rights to the design and commenced production as the CT 37. It was initially called the Ta Chiao 37 and then the Ta Yang 37, before the name was changed to the Tayana 37. ==Production== The design is built by Ta Yang Yacht Building, under the Tayana Yachts brand in Taiwan. The company had built 588 boats by 2012 and the design remained available for orders in 2020. ==Design== The Tayana 37 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with teak wood trim, including teak decks. It is a cutter rigged sloop, with a few built with the optional ketch rig. The boat has spruce or aluminum spars and a bowsprit that brings the length to . A pilothouse was also optional.

A typical configuration has sleeping accommodation for seven people, with a double \\"V\\"-berth in the bow cabin, a \\"U\\"-shaped settee with a drop-down dinette table and a straight settee in the main cabin, with a pilot berth above and an aft cabin with a double berth on the starboard side. The galley is located on the port side just forward of the companionway ladder. The galley is \\"U\\"-shaped and is equipped with a three-burner propane- fired stove, an oven and a double sink. A navigation station is opposite the galley, on the starboard side. The head is located just aft of the bow cabin on the port side and includes a shower, with a teak floor grating, plus hot and cold pressurized water. The interior trim and doors are all made from teak. Ventilation is provided by eleven bronze ports, a teak forward hatch and a teak-framed skylight. For sailing the design is equipped with two travelers, including a staysail traveler, as the staysail is boom-mounted and a mainsheet traveler. There are two winches for the jib sheets, one for the jib, one for the mainsheet and three for the three sail halyards. There are jib tracks mounted on the toe rails, plus outboard shrouds. The design has a PHRF racing average handicap of 126. ==Operational history== Tayana 37 In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote that the \\"Tayana [37] is in many respects ‚Äî perhaps except for the double-ended design ‚Äî typical of the many high-performance designs built today that retain a traditional appearance.\\" In a 2019 review, Charles Doane wrote, \\"the Tayana 37 is the most successful of the many Taiwan- built double-ended full-keel cruisers that were conceived in the mid-1970s in the wake of the great success of the Westsail 32 ... This boat is quite heavy by today's standards, but it sails remarkably well and can serve effectively as both a coastal and bluewater cruiser. It has a particularly strong reputation as an offshore boat and is certainly one of the more popular bluewater cruisers ever built. Reportedly at any given time there are more Tayana 37s out there wandering the globe than any other single type of sailboat.\\" Writing a review in 2012 Steve Knauth noted, \\"the Tayana 37 is distinguished most by its double-ended hull. The deep, full-keel bottom is designed for bluewater cruising, and the vessel‚Äôs 22,500-pound displacement includes 8,000 pounds of outside ballast. Construction is solid, hand-laid fiberglass. Designer Robert Perry drew up two twin-headstay rigs, and the boat was rigged either as a cutter or ketch. Both versions carry large sail plans ‚Äî the cutter more than 800 square feet, the ketch more than 750. They‚Äôre based on a high aspect mainsail for upwind work and twin headsails for versatility. The deck profile shows a traditional trunk cabin ahead of a roomy aft cockpit with pedestal steering and controls, surrounded by a high coaming. Bow and stern pulpits are joined by double lifelines with both port and starboard gates.

Her mother Edith Goldschmidt (1883-1942) - a granddaughter of the founder of the first female high school in Leipzig, Henriette Goldschmidt - could not escape the persecution of Jews and committed suicide with her sister in 1942. Her father Martin Pappenheim (1881-1943) was head of the neurological department at Lainz Hospital, who emigrated to Palestine in 1934 as an opponent of Austrofascism. Her aunt was Marie (Mitzi) Pappenheim, who was one of the first women to receive her doctorate from the medical school in Vienna; under her married name Marie Frischauf, she ran sex advice centers for the poor in Vienna together with Wilhelm Reich, before emigrating in 1934. Else Pappenheim grew up in Vienna, where she attended Eugenie Schwarzwald's reform school before beginning her studies in medicine. In 1937, Pappenheim was one of the last analysts to be trained at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute. Until March 1938, Pappenheim worked at the University Hospital Vienna as a secondary doctor for neurology and psychiatry. After the connection, the Psychoanalytical Institute was closed and its members were forced to flee. Pappenheim emigrated to the United States via Palestine, where she met American psychoanalysis at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore with one of the leading US psychiatrists, Adolf Meyer, whose analytical level, however, she found \\"primitive\\".In the United States, Else Pappenheim married Stephen Frishauf in 1946, who had also emigrated from Austria. The family later lived in New York, where the now Else Frishauf worked as a freelance psychoanalyst and held professorships at various universities. In 1956 Pappenheim visited Austria again for the first time since her flight. However, it was not until 1987, as part of the \\"Expelled Reason\\" symposium, in which she took part along with many other emigrants, that there was a certain rapprochement with Austria in the form of an exchange with young Austrian psychiatrists and psychoanalysts. Else Pappenheim died in New York at the age of 97. She was the last living member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Association from before 1938 and one of the last witnesses who could provide information about the end and re-establishment of psychoanalysis. == Writings == * Else Pappenheim: Contemporary Witness , in: Friedrich Stadler [Ed.]: International Symposium, October 19 to 23, 1987 in Vienna: Emigration and Exile of Austrian Science , Vienna: Youth and People, 1987 , p 221‚Äì229 (autobiographical) == References == Category:1911 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Neurologists Category:Psychoanalysts Category:Psychiatrists Category:People from Salzburg ","title":"Else Pappenheim"},{"id":"63936920","text":"Federico Antonio Mariscal Abascal (24 September 1910 - 5 January 2002) was a Mexican diver.

In science diplomacy, collaboration takes place to advance science but science can also be used to facilitate diplomatic relations. This allows even conflicting nations to come together through science to find solutions to global issues. Global organizations, researchers, public health officials, countries, government officials, and clinicians have previously worked together to create effective measures of infection control and subsequent treatment. They continue to do so through sharing of resources, research data, ideas, and by putting into effect laws and regulations that can further advance scientific research. Without the collaborative efforts of such entities, the world would not have the vaccines and treatments we now possess for diseases that were once considered deadly such as tuberculosis, tetanus, polio, influenza, etc. Historically, science diplomacy has proved successful in diseases such as SARS, Ebola, Zika and continues to be relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic today. == Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) == The 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic is often labeled the first pandemic of the 21st century. It initially appeared in China at the end of 2002 and quickly spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. The virus that causes SARS is known as SARS- associated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and is highly contagious, producing sometimes fatal respiratory illnesses. It can easily spread through close person-to-person contact. In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a total of 8098 infections and 774 deaths. Only 8 tested positive for SARS-CoV in the United States at the time. The collaborative efforts by organizations, countries, researchers and public health officials all over the world led to containment of the virus within about 5‚Äì6 months. WHO first announced a global alert for a severe pneumonia-like disease on March 12. Measures taken by WHO ensured that consistent reports regarding countries most affected by the outbreak were received. WHO‚Äôs collaboration with other organizations such as media outlets, UN agencies, and Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) allowed for identification of locations with new SARS cases. WHO also utilized the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), developed for WHO by Health Canada, to improve the speed of outbreak detection and advance the response time. Immediate action was taken to implement proper containment measures when outbreak locations were identified. WHO also partnered with GOARN to dispatch teams of experts into areas heavily impacted by SARS such as China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Vietnam. These experts represented around 20 different organizations and 15 different nationalities and worked in several sectors to contain the virus. Epidemiologists of varied backgrounds also worked together to review the measures to control the spread of the virus as well as analyze the behavior of the virus in transmission. Such epidemiologists hailed from the Health Protection Agency (United Kingdom), the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (Japan), the Robert Koch-Institut (Germany) and more. Clinicians representing over 11 countries also played integral roles in measures to fight the virus by working together to create effective treatment plans and improve infection control procedures in hospitals worldwide. Some of them were from H√µpital Universitaire de Gen√©ve (Geneva, Switzerland), National Institute of Health (Slovenia), and Adelaide Meath and National Children‚Äôs Hospital (Dublin, Ireland). In addition, researchers from laboratories around the world shared their findings with each other in hopes of gaining better understanding of the disease to test possible vaccines for SARS. Along with these organizations, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also closely worked with WHO throughout the course of the SARS outbreak. The CDC had promptly activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) just days after WHO‚Äôs global alert and informed the public of this novel disease while providing precautionary protocols to avoid infection. They also established and dispatched teams of specialists of multiple backgrounds to conduct on-site investigations of SARS and carried out extensive research to test SARS specimen in order to identify its cause and transmission behavior. In July, WHO officially announced that the SARS epidemic had been contained. However, even after intense efforts, no successful vaccine was created to combat SARS. In 2003, it took a considerable amount of time before the genome sequence of the virus was available and it wasn't until 2004 that possible vaccine trials were conducted in humans. Researchers in a 2005 journal proposed possible methods of vaccine development noting the possibility of an inactivated SARS- CoV based vaccine. They also proposed spike (S) protein, a glycoprotein component of SARS-CoV membrane, based vaccines as well as a recombinant RBD (a fragment in S protein) based vaccines. They concluded that of these methods, RBD vaccines may be the safest means of combating SARS, though no such effective vaccine currently exists. Nonetheless, collaborative efforts around SARS lead to major advancements in global public health. After SARS, the U.S. Department of Human and Health Services \\"amended the regulations to streamline the process of adding future emerging infectious diseases.\\" Quarantine regulations of CDC were also revised to streamline the responsiveness to global health emergencies and \\"increase legal preparedness.\\" Collaboration between the U.S and China also improved after SARS as Tommy Thompson, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services visited China in October of 2003 and \\"signed a multiyear partnership with the Chinese Ministry of Health to develop a more robust public health infrastructure in China. Thompson also established an HHS health attach√© at the U.S. embassy in Beijing.\\" China's overall responsiveness and preparedness to infectious disease has also significantly improved since SARS as evident by their cooperative efforts in curbing the current SARS-CoV2 pandemic. Collaborative efforts were crucial to the containment of SARS. The importance of open collaboration was acknowledged formally in May 2003 when a resolution was adopted on SARS by delegates at the World Health Assembly; it called for the full support of all countries in combating SARS along with full transparency and steadfast reporting of requested information. A second resolution to improve International Health Regulations gave WHO the authority to take a much stronger role in case of infectious diseases that pose a threat to public health. This allowed WHO to act and respond to outbreaks using its own resources rather than waiting for official government notifications of outbreaks. == Ebola == The Western African Ebola virus epidemic took more than 11,000 lives. Science diplomats traveled the world and worked with scientists from other countries in the hope of finding a vaccine to conquer the Ebola outbreak. The Ebola virus causes severe bleeding causing organ failure, lack of oxygen to the body, and it can lead to death. Scientists first discovered the Ebola virus in 1976 in Democratic Republic of Congo. Since then it has spread to other countries. It affected mostly West African countries. The largest outbreak of the Ebola virus from 2014‚Äì2016. There were over 28,000 cases. The virus had spread to Guinea, Liberia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Sierra Leone, Mali, Nigeria, Italy, the United States, and more.. The virus spread to more than 17 countries. UNESCO played a huge role in preventing the spread of Ebola to neighboring cities and countries of West Africa. They funded $20,000 to a radio station in Sierra Leone to keep the people informed about the virus and the precautions that they could take in order to avoid it. Ebola did not spread to Koinadugu, Sierra Leone even though it borders the Republic of Guinea. which had 3814 cases and 2844 deaths Moreover, the United Nations and International Non-Governmental Organizations have supported the public health response to bring an end to the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). They have made huge efforts to track the Ebola virus, to find out where it moves next in order to prevent transmission of the virus. The first Ebola outbreak was discovered in the DRC in a village near the Ebola River, which gave the virus its name. The 1976 Ebola outbreak was much more contained than the 2014‚Äì2016 outbreak. The 1976 Ebola outbreak lasted about 11 weeks. There were 318 cases and 280 deaths. The death rate was around 88 percent. In contrast, the Western African Ebola virus epidemic lasted more than two years, had nearly 29,000 cases and 11,310 deaths. The death rate of the Western African Ebola virus epidemic was around 50 percent. During the Western African Ebola virus epidemic, science diplomats and other medical professionals traveled around the world to help track the outbreak. They tried to reduce the number of cases and deaths of the Ebola virus by studying the disease and testing possible vaccines or treatments to contain it. Even though it looked like they were not progressing, Scientists made huge efforts to minimize the Ebola virus. They tested many vaccines and treatments. Canadian scientists had been working on the Ebola vaccine research decades before the 2014‚Äì2016 outbreak. But, they were not making huge progress because they did not have enough funding. In 2010, Lead scientists left to do other research. But, one dedicated manager kept the research going. It wasn‚Äôt until the 2014‚Äì2016 outbreak that they received more funding. In August 2014, Canada donated 3.6 million dollars to the WHO and MSF. Scientists received more than 120 million dollars from the Canadian government, the US government, and the WHO to support clinical trials during the epidemic. Canada developed the first vaccine approved by the world. Millions of dollars were spent to create the vaccine and it was developed by Merck. But it would not have happened without scientists from three different continents in multiple countries. The vaccine ERVEBO is used to protect against the Ebola virus. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in December 2019. Although there are no antiviral drugs approved by the FDA to treat people who currently have Ebola, there are alternative treatments such as: IV fluids, oxygen support, blood transfusions, and the vaccine ERVEBO, among others. == Zika == Zika is a flavivirus (a genus of viruses in the family of Flaviviridae) is a mosquito-borne infection that was first identified in monkeys in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947. It mainly spreads to people through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus mosquito. In 1952, the first human illness caused by the Zika virus was reported in Nigeria. The first outbreak of Zika virus outside of Africa or Asia took place in 2007, within the state of Yap in Micronesia. In 2013, a large-scale Zika infection in French Polynesia and other countries and territories in the Pacific was recorded. In March 2015, Zika virus was first discovered in the Americas, when Brazil reported a large outbreak of rash illness, soon identified as Zika virus infection. By March 2016, the virus had affected at least 33 countries and territories in America. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 87 countries have reported evidence of mosquito-borne Zika virus. The increase in the number of cases led to the World Health Organization (WHO) confirming Zika virus as an international public health emergency. In July 2015, Zika virus was discovered to be the cause of fetal microcephaly, as well as other neurological abnormalities in unborn babies The humanitarian organization for children called Save the Children, aimed to educate children and families of underserved communities in the U.S and other countries about Zika. The group has been working with collaborators in 200 schools in 20 states and has launched services to help them learn about Zika. Direct Relief, another humanitarian organization active in all 50 states and more than 80 countries, established a Zika fund and worked closely with health officials and hospitals in 14 impacted countries to provide the necessary supplies to vulnerable community.WHO and other international health organizations carried out research development activities focused on diagnostic tests, vaccines, treatments and innovative methods to control mosquitoes. According to WHO, 18 companies were working on the vaccines, as of March 2016. The World Health Organization‚Äôs priority was to develop a vaccine that was safe for use by pregnant women. With that in mind, the research institutions aimed to create inactivated vaccines, which were produced by treating infectious viruses with chemicals that destroy infectivity but maintain the capacity of the virus to induce a protective immune response. In 2016, The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, conducted a human clinical trial of the vaccine called the NIAID Zika virus investigational DNA vaccine. In 2017, the phase 2/2b clinical trials were conducted, with the target of obtaining more safety and immune response against the diseases caused by Zika virus. There is no effective vaccine available for Zika virus infection yet, therefore, different countries have taken precautionary steps to limit its spread. Since Zika was a global threat, it was important for scientists, healthcare professionals, and legal counsels to understand the role of law and policy in preparing to slow down the virus and to respond accordingly. Various organizations have helped raise funds to fight the virus. March of dimes helped fight the Zika virus with the assistance of thousands of volunteers and supporters who signed the petition asking for congressional intervention on Zika prevention. The Senate and the House of Representatives approved bills offering $1.1 billion in funding to combat Zika, which President Obama eventually signed. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Sylvia Burwell, at the behest of Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla, announced a public health emergency for Puerto Rico, suggesting that the ongoing outbreak of Zika virus presents a serious threat to public safety. WHO issued guidelines outlined in the Zika Strategic Response Framework to effectively interfere and help families, communities and countries to control Zika virus disease. The 4 main goals of The Response Plan, detection, prevention, care & support and research, have supported national governments and communities to prevent and manage the complications of Zika virus. Innovative ways of coping with mosquito control were directed in countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also helped improve the capacity of Laboratories to test for Zika virus infection worldwide. The US Centers for Disease and Prevention (CDC) provided an action plan to prevent the spread of the Zika virus. CDC provided surveillance instructions for taking precautions before and during the mosquito season. MAC-ELISA testing kits were developed and distributed to the states. CDC has also developed Trioplex rRT-PCR that helped to detect Zika and other related viruses, including dengue and chikungunya virus RNA. == COVID-19 == On December 31, 2019, authorities in Wuhan, China reported the first cases of an unknown pneumonia to the World Health Organization (WHO). Shortly after that, on January 4, 2020, the WHO reported on social media that there had been a group of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China but that no deaths had been reported. The unknown pneumonia was a novel coronavirus, which they later named COVID-19. WHO quickly realized that it was a serious problem and issues between science and diplomacy on the topic of COVID-19 became evident. The Chinese government did not alert the WHO about the full extent of the seriousness of the outbreak. By the time the WHO realized that the problem was serious, the false information of a low mortality rate and its low risk to non-senior citizens had already spread very rapidly. The United States and the WHO tried to send scientists to help China fight COVID-19; however, China refused the help. China did eventually share the genome sequence of COVID-19 with the global community and later accepted another offer from the WHO to send a team of scientists to help. The lack of communication and the slow transmission of information between science and government caused failures to slow the spread of the virus in its early stages. To further complicate this stage, when scientists did give information or guidance, governments did not take it into proper consideration. As a result, by not acting fast enough, many people were infected and local economies suffered due to the slow decision to act in unison. The overall impact on society would have been less detrimental if governments had acted in collaboration with each other and scientists. Some progress has been made among the scientific community itself in creating transparency, so local scientists in each region have access to the information they need to fight COVID-19. For example, the global scientific community began making efforts to communicate and share relevant information to help combat COVID-19 without delay. The WHO reported that a global research roadmap has been created in March of 2020 to fight COVID-19. Scientists are publishing research findings before they are peer-reviewed and sharing other discoveries without delay. Scientists and clinicians are working to fight the epidemic by sharing data through information sharing technologies using bioRxiv, medRxiv, ChemRxiv, and arXiv, which allows them to share information in real time. These tools are helping biopharma research and development, academic labs, government regulators, and the clinical community to speed up the process of testing new pathways to treating COVID-19 patients more efficiently. As one researcher explains, ‚ÄúWe are experiencing a shift towards Open Science at a speed that was previously unthinkable. It began with the publication of the genetic sequence of COVID-19 by Chinese scientists in early January 2020 via GenBank ‚Äì an open-access DNA database operated by the US National Center for Biotechnology Information‚Äù Additionally, The World Economic Forum has partnered with the WHO to mobilize and help supply the needed resources required to fight COVID-19 itself and the economic impact it is having. With the sharing of this information around the world by scientific communities, each individual country is better equipped with the knowledge they need to combat the pandemic and investigate possible treatments, testing, and vaccines. In the most current WHO published table of COVID-19 vaccines, there are 124 candidates that are in different stages of vaccine development []. == See also == * 2002-2004 SARS outbreak * 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic * COVID-19 pandemic * COVID-19 vaccine * Ebola vaccine * List of Ebola outbreaks * SARS * World Health Organization's response to the COVID-19 pandemic * Zika virus vaccine * Zika virus outbreak timeline == References == Category:Science diplomacy Category:Pandemics __INDEX__ ","title":"Science diplomacy and pandemics"},{"id":"63937030","text":"Encore is a live album by German jazz double bassist and composer Eberhard Weber recorded at various locations between 1990 and 2007 and released on the ECM label on 6 February 2015. ==Background== Encore is a follow-up volume to his previous 2011 release R√©sum√©.

He was baptised on 16 October 1760. De Roever made a career in the colonial administration of the Dutch Gold Coast. He became acting governor-general of the Dutch Gold Coast after the death of governor-general Cornelius Ludwich Bartels on 18 April 1804. During his term in office, he was summoned to answer his superiors in the Batavian Republic for \\"excessive behaviours\\". De Roever served until 16 June 1805, when he was relieved by Pieter Linthorst so that he could recover from illness in the Netherlands. This appointment proved controversial, however, as it was done by the Small Council in Elmina, without the presence of the resident of Fort Saint Anthony Jan Frederik K√∂nig, who was the more senior resident on the Gold Coast and the more logical successor of De Roever. K√∂nig protested the procedure, but nevertheless accepted the decision made. In 1810, Isaac de Roever bought the buitenplaats of Meergenoegen in Watergraafsmeer near Amsterdam from . Farret probably had to sell his estate because of financial problems caused by Napoleon's tiercering of Dutch government bonds. De Roever subsequently became mayor of Diemen.

Originally the site of one of the Qianlong Emperor's Palaces at the northern foot of Yunlong Mountain, the Xuzhou Museum was established in 1959, expanded in 1999, then rebuilt and extended in 2010, with work completed in 2012. At present, it encompasses an area of 40,000 square meters. The museum includes a four-story exhibition building and administers the Xanadu Palace and Stone Tablet Garden of the Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty built for his inspection tour of the south of the Yangtze River in 1757. It also administers three tombs of the Pengcheng King of the Eastern Han Dynasty in Tu Shan, that includes an excavation site of Han Dynasty terracotta warriors and horses. ==Collections== The museum's collections number 15,577 objects displayed in seven galleries, ‚ÄúMetal Hardware and Battle Steed‚Äù, ‚ÄúTreasures of the Han Dynasty‚Äù, ‚ÄúMarvelous Jade of the Han Dynasty‚Äù, ‚ÄúOrnate Terracotta Figurines‚Äù, ‚ÄúChinese Porcelain and Other Collections‚Äù, ‚ÄúQing-style furniture‚Äù, and ‚Äúancient Chinese painting and calligraphy donated by Deng Yongqing‚Äù representing 6,000 years of civilization. The region around Xuzhou, once known as the ancient city of Pengcheng, became a thriving trading center because of its strategic location between north and south China and once rich alluvial soil deposited by the annual flood of the Yellow River. It has yielded artifacts up to one million years old. The Xizyuandun Longshan Culture Ruins are the remains of a Neolithic settlement of the Dawenkou culture dating back to 4100 BCE. The museum includes Neolithic artifacts among its collections. The early tribal cultures in the area transitioned to a chiefdom under the rule of legendary figure Peng Zu in the 2nd millennium followed by successive military conquests beginning with King Wu Ding of Shang in around 1208 BCE. Military artifacts on display range from the armor of the Han and Chu periods to the weapons of the Tang, Song and Yuan Dynasties and armor and artillery of the Ming dynasty.

The sculptures were found in 1984 in six pits, three infantry pits, one pottery- guard pit, one cavalry pit and one chariot pit. But, only two infantry pits and the pottery-guard pit have been fully excavated. The two infantry pits yielded 2,393 figures but they are smaller in size, about a foot tall, than the life-sized Xi'an terracotta warriors and horses from the Qin Dynasty. The figures were arranged in a battle formation of the Chu Kingdom and soldiers still armed with crossbows and wearing armor of the period are posed both standing and kneeling. As subjects of the dead Chu king, the warriors are depicted with respectful though sorrowful expressions. Since citizens of the period between 18 and 55 were required to join the army in times of conflict, the sculptures portray both young and older soldiers. ==Other Archaeology== Museum archaeologists have also participated in excavations of Western Zhou and Han Dynasty sites at Miao Taizi and Jiaozhuang in Jiawang, the Woniushan Tombs, the Wanda Plaza Tombs, the Kuishan Tombs, and the Tiechashan Tombs. ==References== Category:Museums in Jiangsu Category:Buildings and structures in Xuzhou ","title":"Xuzhou Museum"},{"id":"63937175","text":"Daisy Intelligence is a Canadian Artificial Intelligence (AI) company that provides data analysis services to help retailers, mainly grocers and supermarkets, to determine optimal pricing and promotional mix.

Africa's many diverse countries are sources of vibrant design with African design influences visible in historical and contemporary art and culture around the world. The study of African design is still limited, particularly from the viewpoint of Africans, and the opportunity to expand its current definition by exploring African visual representations and introducing contemporary design applications remains immense. == Key Characteristics == Like all design forms, African design is defined by its creativity, continuously evolving, neither isolated nor static. Design is a form of story- telling and it is a medium through which those stories are told. In 2009, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie spoke on \\"The Danger of a Single Story\\" which has become one of the top ten most-viewed TED Talks of all time. For years African design has been stereotyped, represented by ethnic prints and earthy colors and textures. Yet with 54 countries and over 1.2 billion people estimated in Africa as of 2018 and 210 million across the African diaspora (Brazil, the Caribbean, and the United States), African design is not limited to a single aesthetic or singular history; rather it is multifaceted and influenced by the historical and present-day, local and global context in which the designer or consumer lives. African design is rooted in rich heritage, techniques, and craftsmanship. As contemporary African designers move on from externally imposed definitions of the colonial era, they acknowledge African traditional craft and craftsmanship is where they draw inspiration: preserving the past by putting a focus on their heritage and traditions while remaining open to global influences and technology. An example is the architecture of the Kenyan National Library, inspired by the Djembe drum. Across Africa, sustainable design focusing on social responsibility and the environment is important and the use of locally sourced natural materials has always been part of the African design process. As stated by Professor Mugendi K M‚ÄôRithaa ‚ÄúIt is about design for, and with, society.‚Äù == History of African Design == For centuries African kingdoms generated wealth from trading natural resources with other Africans and later Arabs and Europeans. The Asante Empire‚Äôs dominance over the gold trade has been documented. Similarly, rich agricultural societies of Central Africa and Southern Africa exchanged goods with the Portuguese since the 16th century. This wealth spurred local design and creativity across architecture, art, textiles, and other design forms. Examples include the 11th century Great Zimbabwe and the other 200 mortarless wall cities throughout Southern Africa as well as the Benin Bronzes created from the 13th century in the Benin Empire (present-day Nigeria). Textile weaving also flourished due to patronage by kings, chiefs, and other royals and aristocrats for ceremonial occasions such as birth, marriage, and funerals. In Nigeria, the ancient city of Kano was known for its highly developed textile industry and indigo dyeing- pits. In Central Africa, the Bamileke bought beads to decorate thrones and ceremonial clothing thereby enhancing their importance. External influences, particularly religion, also impacted design across Africa. Religion's requirements for modesty encouraged the adoption of clothing. The arrival of Islam in the 11th century in West Africa and later Christianity in the 1450s in Cape Verde which spread along the West African coast and then inland stimulated local production of stripwoven cloths as well as demand for imported fabrics. In East Africa, cotton was introduced by Arabs in Ethiopia which spurred cotton-growing and a weaving industry to turn cotton into textiles. === Textiles === Textiles by Eva Sonaike shown in her throw pillow collection; prints inspired by Yoruba embroidery and West African architectural decoration. 2009-present. Historically textiles were used as a form of money in West Africa and Central Africa. There are records of cloth being used as money since the fourteenth century. Pieces were made identical in size, efficiently carried, and exchanged in quantities based on the value of the item or trade. Across Africa, there are many distinctive local styles. Wealthy individuals and traders required different types of locally-woven and imported cloth to enhance their prestige, driving demand. The Kuba in Cameroon and Congo has one of the widest range of textile skills in Africa including weaving cloth from leaves of raphia palm as well as embroidery, appliqu√©, cut- pile, and resist dyeing techniques. === Metalwork & Goldsmithing === Further information: Ghana Akan goldweights, Benin Bronzes === Art === Further information Prehistoric African Art, African Art thematic elements, history and influence, Museum of Black Civilisations === Architecture === Further information: Architecture of Africa, Moroccan Architecture === Influence on Global Design === Further information: African Art in Western Collections == Contemporary African Design == Design is playing an important role as African designers move on from externally imposed definitions of the colonial era and redefine African design on their own terms. African designers acknowledge traditional craft and craftsmanship in contemporary designs. This places a focus on their heritage and traditions while remaining open to global influences and technology, and creates contemporary designs that take into account social sustainability and environmental sustainability needs of each region. === Institutions === Below are the institutions that showcase and support the study of African design, with an increasing focus on the perspective of Africans and the African diaspora.

This limited-edition collection of African- inspired tableware, furniture, and textiles has been available for purchase across all IKEA markets since May 2019 * Museum of African Design: Based in the Maboneng Precinct in Johannesburg, this is Africa's first museum dedicated to design. The museum is not a collecting museum and therefore does not have permanent collections. It is a space that, through collaboration with partner institutions, explores the evolving African continent and the African diaspora through exhibitions, installations, and showcase events. The museum officially opened in October 2013. * Black Artists & Designers Guild (BADG): Founded in 2018 by Malene Barnett, an artist based in Brooklyn, New York, to address the lack of representation of Black talent and culture in the design industry. Barnett describes it as \\"a curated collective of black artists and designers throughout the African diaspora.\\" === Art === Further information: Contemporary African Art, Contemporary African Art exhibitions, World Festival of Black Arts, Museum of Black Civilisations, The Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art and Art X Lagos Further information: African American Art, Influence of African Art on Western Art and General concept of Art === Architectural Design === Further information: Architecture of Africa, David Adjaye, Architect Africa Film Festival, List of Architecture Schools, Moroccan Architecture === Furniture === The Nyala Chair, hand-carved from mahogany, or walnut.

He produced it in support of George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign. The print depicts a photograph of then-President of the United States Richard Nixon with his face dyed green and blue, and with his jacket and tie dyed pink and red, respectively. It was Warhol's first political poster and has been described as Warhol's \\"most overtly political work\\". The photograph of Nixon on which the print is based was taken from a photograph of him and his wife Pat Nixon on the cover of Newsweek; Warhol chose the colors used to dye Nixon's face based on those of Mrs. Nixon's dress. Art critic Jonathan Jones described the print as follows: \\"Nixon's face is acidic green, colliding shockingly with an orange background, almost like classical Indian art in its chromatic intensity. It captures the way Nixon in the flesh looked like a cartoon, his head too big for his body. But that's all in the way of satire.\\" In 2016, it was featured in a printmaking exhibition at the British Museum. ==References== ==External links== *Entry at British Museum website Category:Lithographs Category:Cultural depictions of Richard Nixon Category:Art by Andy Warhol Category:1972 works Category:Prints and drawings in the British Museum Category:Prints (art) ","title":"Vote McGovern"},{"id":"63937346","text":"Merc√® Boada y Rovira (born Barcelona, 14 October 1948) is a Catalan neurologist.

The work is regarded as among the most prominent of northern Croatian literature, being a part of the Ozalj literary circle. ==Creation and background== The work was written during Frankopan's imprisonment in Wiener Neustadt, prior to his execution for his participation in Magnate conspiracy. He likely intended the work to be published, but the original manuscript was transferred to a local library following his death, thus slipping into obscurity.Gartlic za ƒças kratiti Frana Krste Frankopana : u povodu 340. obljetnice od pogibije Frana Krste Frankopana i 140. obljetnice od izla≈æenja Gartlica, Ivana Sabljak ≈Ωeljka Metesi Deronjiƒá estimates that most of the text was conceived prior to his arrest between 1663 and 1670.Poimanje ljepote i ljubavi u stihovima Frana Krste Frankopana ==Description== Wiener Neustadt, place of his imprisonment, where he completed the work It is a collection of lyric poems in both conventional and personal style, which Frankopan conceived during the course of his young life, heavily influenced by Marinism. The collection contains a number of war poems, making a genuine reflection of the era in the Habsburg-ruled Croatia. The poet also used a great variety of metres, including those derived from folk poetry. Part of this collection consists of reworks of Italian and Austrian poems.PJESNIƒåKI LIK FRANA KRSTE FRANKOPANA, Snje≈æana Hojzan The language is typical of Ozalj literary circle, which employs simple, everyday expression in a ≈†tokavian-Kajkavian-Chakavian dialectal mixture. The deepest and most moving verses are those which he made during his time in prison, which express emotions of a young person, who had lost his parents at an early age, and was taken away from his friend, wife and everything dear to him, floating between life and death. The work is characterized by two lengthy introductions, which use flowers as a metaphor for poems contained within, along with \\"garden\\" (Gartlic) as a collection of poems. There the author introduces himself to the reader as a clover, apologizing for vulgarity and certain unrefined places. This section suggests the work was intended as a lighthearted and fun reading material in a relaxed, melancholic atmosphere. ==Reception and legacy== After the original manuscript was discovered 200 years after Frankopan's execution, it caused a literary sensation, despite not being properly valued at the time. Philologist Vatroslav Jagiƒá was primarily unimpressed by the crudeness of the language in contrast to the finesse of literary languages.Vatroslav Jagiƒá: Frankopanov \\"Vrtiƒá\\". Vienac, III, 20, Zagreb, 1872 Other literary critics at the time were similarily negatively swayed. Mate Ujeviƒá considered many of the poems as distasteful for containing vulgarity and explicit sexual themes, often resulting in censorship. The poems \\"Srce ≈æaluje da vilu ne vidi\\", \\"Cvitja razmi≈°lenje i ≈æalosno protu≈æenje\\" and \\"Titulu≈°a nima, ime vimdar ima\\", are regarded by poet and philologist Josip Bratuliƒá as a high achievement of pre- Illyrian movement Croatian poetryJosip Pupaƒçiƒá, Pristup pjesniƒçkom dijelu Frana Krste Frankopana, Dubrovnik, XIV, 1, str. 61. and rank among the best older Croatian literary worksJosip Bratuliƒá, Poezija Frana Krste Frankopana. Krƒçki zbornik. 6. Krk 1975, str. 168, putting Frankopan as among the best Croatian authors of his time. These are described as being particularly lyrical, vivid and bitter, showing a sense of an independent and very refined Baroque expression including unusual metaphors and contrasts. However, his rework of existing love poetry in Italian were criticized as clumsy. One poem titled Pozivanje na vojsku (Call to arms) was set to music, becoming a prominent reveille and originated a well known and often cited verse \\"navik on ≈æivi ki zgine po≈°teno\\" (he who dies honorably lives forever). Gartlic za ƒças kratiti influenced a number of modern Croatian authors including Miroslav Krle≈æa. ==References== Category:1671 books Category:Croatian-language poets Category:Baroque literature Category:Croatian poems ","title":"Gartlic za ƒças kratiti"},{"id":"63937519","text":"The 160th Infantry Division () was an infantry division of the German Heer during World War II. The unit, at times designated Commander of Reserve Troops X (), Commander of Reserve Troops X/I (), 160th Division (), Division No. 160 (), and 160th Reserve Division (), was active between 1939 and 1945. == History  Commander of Reserve Troops X === As part of the German general mobilization on 26 August 1939, several staffs were activated to supervise the reserve units in each of the Wehrkreis military districts. These staffs were numbered with the Roman numerals that were assigned to their respective military districts. The Commander of Reserve Troops X was formed in the capital city of Wehrkreis X, Hamburg. The initial commander of the command staff was Otto Sch√ºnemann. === Commander of Reserve Troops X/I === The unit was redesignated Commander of Reserve Troops X/I on 25 October 1939. === 160th Division === The Commander of Reserve Troops X/I was redesignated 160th Division on 8 November 1939. === Division No. 160 === The 160th Division became the Division No. 160 on 12 December 1939.

She did not race until she was three years old but established herself as a top-class middle-distance performe in 2007 when she won the Prix de Diane as well as running second in the Prix Vermeille and third in the Pretty Polly Stakes. She was retired from racing after running poorly on her only start as a four-year-old. ==Background== West Wind is a chestnut mare with a white star and a white sock on her left hind leg bred in England, by her owner Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. She was sent into training with Henri-Alex Pantall at Beaupreau in France. She was sired by Machiavellian who was the leading French two-year-old of 1989 when he was unbeaten in three races including the Group One Prix Morny and Prix de la Salamandre. As a breeding stallion his best winners included Street Cry, Almutawakel, Medicean and Storming Home and Chic. West Wind's dam Red Slippers showed high-class racing ability, winning three races including the Sun Chariot Stakes. She was a full-sister to the Jockey Club Stakes winner Romanov and a half-sister to Balanchine. ==Racing career2007: three-year-old season=== West Wind was unraced as a juvenile and began her racing career in the Prix Nikellora over 1600 metres on very soft ground at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 23 March when she started at odds of 3/1 and finished strongly to take third place behind Aloush and Mindarina, beaten three and a half lengths by the winner. The filly was then moved up in distance for the 2000 metre Prix de la Flandrie at Longchamp Racecourse in April in which she led for most of the way before being overtaken 100 metres from the finish and beaten three-quarters of a length by Coquerelle with Aloush in third. Having being partnered by Johan Victoire in her first two races West Wind was ridden by Christophe Lemaire when she contested the Prix de la Chapelle en Serval at Chantilly Racecourse on 9 May and recorded her first success, coming home two and a half lengths clear of the Andr√© Fabre-trained Concentric after taking the lead 200 metres from home. On 10 June at Chantilly West Wind was partnered by Frankie Dettori in the Group 1 Prix de Diane over 2100 metres at Chantilly and went off the 4.5/1 third choice in the betting behind Coquerelle (who had won the Prix Saint-Alary in May) and Vadapolina (Prix Cl√©op√¢tre). The other eleven runners included Cinnamon Bay (Prix d'Angerville), Believe Me (second in the Prix Saint-Alary), Sweet Lily (Silver Tankard Stakes), Mrs Lindsay (Prix Penelope) and Anabaa's Creation (Prix Isonomy). West Wind raced in mid- division before making progress in the straight, overcame interference to overtake the front-running Mrs Lindsay 300 metres from the finish and won by one and a half lengths. Dettori, who had won both the Epsom Derby and the Prix du Jockey Club on the previous weekend, said \\"It is crazy. I am delighted as it is the first time I have won the Prix de Diane, but also I have ridden Alex's first Group 1 winner. It is an historic day. West Wind ran a beautiful race. The trainer was very sweet on her before the race and she quickened beautifully as soon as I asked her\\". An emotional Pantall commented \\"It's been a long time coming\\", said Pantall. \\"All week I was really confident with the only slight worry about whether she would get a clear passage and not get blocked\\". Less than three weeks after her win at Chantilly, West Wind was sent overseas for the first time to contest the Pretty Polly Stakes at the Curragh, a race which saw her matched against older fillies and mares. With Johnny Murtagh in the saddle she started the 7/2 second favourite and finished third behind Peeping Fawn and the four-year-old Speciosa. After a break of almost three months the filly was stepped up in distance for the Prix Vermeille over 2400 metres at Longchamp in which she was reunited with Johan Victoire. After being restrained towards the rear of the ten runner field she produced a strong late run but failed to overhaul Mrs Lindsay and was beaten three quarters into second place. ===2008: four-year-old season=== Before the start of her second season West Wind was transferred to the ownership of Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin and moved to the training stable of Saeed bin Suroor in the United Arab Emirates. On her first and only appearance for her new trainer the filly ran poorly as she came home fifteenth of the sixteen runners in the Dubai Sheema Classic over 2400 metres at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse on 29 March. ==Breeding record== At the end of her racing career West Wind was retired to become a broodmare for Godolphin. She produced at least six foals and three winners: *West Riding, a bay colt (later gelded), foaled in 2010, sired by Cape Cross. Unplaced in only race. *True Match, bay filly, 2011, by Cape Cross. Fourth in only race. *Zephuros, bay colt (gelded), 2012, by Invincible Spirit. Won one races. *Parasail, chestnut filly, 2014, by New Approach.

On Friday, 8 October, Christabel Pankhurst and Constance Lytton met with other suffragettes to finalise their plans for protesting at Lloyd George's public meetings, and to discuss what would happen if they were arrested. Jones, who was young and had not yet been arrested, asked several questions, including whether her tortoiseshell combs would be confiscated by the authorities. The following day, suffragettes protested at the public meetings, some using militant action. Jones was arrested for damaging windows at the Palace Theatre. This was her first arrest. On her third day of imprisonment, she and fellow suffragette Dorothy Pethick were force fed; following their release, they were rushed to a nursing home. Jones and the ten other arrested suffragettes wrote an open letter to The Times which included the line: > We appeal to the Government to yield, not to the violence of our protest, > but the reasonableness of our demand. 182x182pxIn 1910, Jones was visited by suffragette Adela Pankhurst when Pankhurst visited Chesterfield.

Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n was a pioneer of Mexican gastronomy and an entrepreneur of Mexican cuisine. == Early life and family == Josefina Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n was born in 1889 in Aguascalientes. Her mother was Mar√≠a Pe√≥n Valdez, a member of a socially prominent family from Guadalajara. Her father's family was one of the most distinguished families in Mexico--a family dating back to the conquistador Diego Vel√°zquez de Cu√©llar. Josefina was the oldest of four daughters. The family moved to Mexico City shortly before the youngest daughter, Mar√≠a Luisa, was born in 1905. Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n married businessman Joaqu√≠n Gonz√°lez just before her thirtieth birthday and Gonz√°lez died eleven months later. The two had no children together and Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n never remarried. == Career == During the 1930s Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n published recipes in the Poblano publication Mignon Magazine. These recipes were focused on home cooking and giving guidelines to women about how to start a small home business. This experience led her to form the Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n Cooking Academy by the end of the decade. In the cooking school, Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n traveled to various states of the country promoting a national gastronomy proposal based on the relationship between good eating, family spending, nutrition, history, and regional cuisine. Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n promoted a revaluation of home cooking in addition to classifying and cataloging the diversity of dishes of national cuisine. In her cooking classes she taught modules and subjects such as: daily simple cooking, modern cooking, haute cuisine, simple baking, artistic jellies, and Mexican specialties. In the late 1930s, she published her first cookbook Manual practico de cocina reposter√≠a. By the mid-1940s, Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n started her publishing house, Ediciones J. Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n, which was dedicated exclusively to publishing Mexican and international cookbooks. Publications were distributed through correspondence, sending classes to students in other states by mail until the 1960s, making her a pioneer in this field. Her work Platillos regionales de la Rep√∫blica Mexicana (1946) highlighted the culinary identity and characteristics of the food from more than half of the Mexican states. In her book, C√≥mo cocinar en los aparatos modernos (1949), she updated cooking techniques by teaching how to cook in Presto's express cooker, Ekco's miracle oven, and Oster's and Sunbeam's electric mixers. Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n ultimately published more than 140 cookbooks across her career. Cover of the book \\"La cocina en el aire\\" by Josefina Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n. In addition to publishing, Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n ventured into radio and television broadcasting. In February 1946, she launched her daily radio show La flojera en la cocina on station XEW. Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n created programming for other Mexico City radio stations as well, XEQ, XEK, and XEJP, and eventually compiled many of the featured recipes into a book entitled La cocina en el aire. In the early 1950s, she developed the first cooking program for Mexican television, entitled El Menu de la Semana. As with her radio program, El Menu de la Semana resulted in publications, namely a series of Tele-cocina booklets. Her motto was \\"saber cocinar es la base de la econom√≠a\\" or \\"knowing how to cook is the basis of the economy\\". Upon her death, her sisters attempted to carry on her legacy, but eventually the Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n Cooking Academy closed its doors and the rights to her books were sold. == Legacy == Many famous chefs have been influenced by Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n's work.

Her father was Nicholas Devereux, proprietor of Bishop's Water Distillery, Wexford. She was the niece of John Thomas Devereux and Richard Joseph Devereux. In 1850, she married John Locke, the owner of Locke's Distillery, and lived in Brusna House beside the distillery. The couple had three sons, the eldest of whom died in infancy, they also had a daughter who died as an infant. After the death of her husband, Locke took over the running of the distillery from 1868 to around 1880. She added a retail spirit store to the site in 1868 beside Brusna House. During her time in charge, the distillery doubled its throughput, and there was continued investment in machinery and buildings. By extending the distilling season and doubling the number of distilling periods each season, Locke increased the cost efficiency of the business, with output rising to 78,000 gallons by 1875. Locke retired around 1880 when her eldest son, John Edward Locke, was old enough to run the business. Aided by her father, Locke helped to finance the establishment of a Convent of Mercy in Kilbeggan in 1879. She provided the land and ¬£1,000 for the construction, later endowing a further ¬£6,000. Locke had moved from Brusna House to Ardnaglue House near Kilbeggan after she was widowed.

She was the first Black Canadian woman to become a judge in Canada, and the first black judge in the province of Nova Scotia. Her decision in the case R v S (RD), which was controversially overturned on appeal, was later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in a leading decision on reasonable apprehension of bias. ==Education== Sparks is from the area around Loon Lake, Nova Scotia, which is a historically racially segregated community. She was descended both from Black Loyalists and from Black Refugees to Nova Scotia. In 1971 Sparks matriculated at Mount Saint Vincent University, where she majored in economics with the intention of being a history teacher. While Sparks was a student, she volunteered as a probation officer at the Department of Justice, and took a summer job with the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission. This legal experience prompted her to consider attending law school, and she was accepted to The Schulich School of Law at Dalhousie University, where in a class of 120 incoming students she was one of only 3 African Nova Scotians and the only black woman. Sparks graduated with an LLB degree in 1979. After graduating from Dalhousie Law School, Sparks entered private legal practice in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, where she worked in family law. The practice that Sparks ran with Helen Foote was the first all- female law firm in Nova Scotia. In 2001, Sparks returned to Dalhousie Law School to obtain an LL.M degree. Her Masters Thesis studied the relocation and compensation of residents of Halifax's Africville, and was called The Construction and Deconstruction of Africville: A Case for Reparation. ==Career== On March 27, 1987, Sparks was appointed to the family court of Halifax, which made her the first black woman appointed to the Bench, and the first black judge in Nova Scotia. J. Michael MacDonald, the Chief Justice of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, has noted that at the time of Sparks's appointment, the Canadian court system was slowly becoming more representative of local communities under the relatively new Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In 1995, Sparks heard the case R v S (RD), in which a 15-year old black teenager was accused of hitting a police officer with his bicycle while the officer was attempting to arrest another person. Sparks acquitted the defendant, and in her decision she explicitly appealed to the \\"prevalent attitude of the day\\" as social context relevant to the ruling. The legal scholars Allan C. Hutchinson and Kathleen Strachan later summarized Sparks's specific finding in the case as follows: the police officer in question was acting in a context in which police officers have been known to overreact while dealing with non-white people, and certain claims by the defendant were believable in context, with the consequence that the Crown had not discharged its evidentiary burden to prove that all of the alleged offenses had occurred beyond a reasonable doubt. The Crown appealed Sparks's decision, focusing their case on the possible apprehension of bias, asserting that as a black Nova Scotian Sparks may have been biased towards the black Nova Scotian defendant. The motivation for this appeal caused substantial controversy, particularly since the allegation of bias was directed against the first black woman to be a judge in Canada, who was also at that time the only black female judge in Nova Scotia, as well as the most senior woman and only racialized minority judge in the province's family court bench. The appeal was initially successful, and Sparks's decision was overturned by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, but the case was taken up by the Supreme Court of Canada who in 1997 reversed the decision by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal and restored Sparks's original decision. This appeal and the Supreme Court's rejection of it have been studied for their implications of bias in the Canadian justice system, and how they affect the reasonable apprehension of bias. The political scientist Shanti Fernando wrote that the appeal against Sparks assumed two things: first that to observe the existence of systemic racial bias in the legal system is to violate judicial impartiality, and second that judges are more sympathetic to defendants of the same ethnicity. Hutchinson and Strachan wrote that the case functions \\"as a springboard\\" for understanding the connection between a judge's interpretation and their identity in their legal decision-making. Judges have subsequently argued that the absence of similar official accusations of bias against white judges does not signify that white judges have never been biased towards white defendants, but rather demonstrates a depth of bias against non-white people in the Canadian justice system at the time. During her career as a lawyer and as a judge, Sparks has worked on the question of ensuring equity in Canadian law. In 1993, Sparks served on the Gender Equality Task Force of the Canadian Bar Association. Sparks has also taught with the Commonwealth Judicial Education Institute, where she has conducted social context training. Sparks was a 2015 inductee of the Bertha Wilson Honour Society, which recognises alumni of the Schulich School of Law, in honour of Bertha Wilson, the first woman on the Ontario Court of Appeal and the first female Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. Sparks has also received the Lillian Fish Award from the National Association of the Women and the Law, as well as awards from the Elizabeth Fry Society, the Canadian Bar Association, and The Congress of Black Women. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Canadian judges Category:Canadian women judges Category:Judges in Nova Scotia Category:Lawyers in Nova Scotia Category:20th- century Canadian lawyers Category:21st-century Canadian lawyers Category:Black Canadian lawyers Category:Canadian women lawyers Category:20th-century Canadian women writers Category:21st-century Canadian women writers Category:Black Nova Scotians Category:Black Canadian women Category:Black Canadian writers Category:Canadian people of African-American descent Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:20th-century women lawyers Category:21st-century women lawyers ","title":"Corrine Sparks"},{"id":"63938023","text":"The Takuba Task Force is a European military task force which will advise, assist and accompany Malian Armed Forces, in coordination with G5-Sahel partners and other international actors on the ground.

It includes two office buildings and 160 apartment units. Gemstone Development began construction of the project, originally known as ManhattanWest, in 2007. The project initially was to include condominiums, retail, and office space. Construction was suspended in December 2008, because of financial problems. ManhattanWest was sold in 2013, and construction resumed, with the project now known as The Gramercy. It opened in November 2014. An unfinished nine-story condominium tower was imploded in February 2015, as completing it would have been too costly. ==HistoryManhattanWest=== In 2006, Gemstone Development completed a 700-unit condominium property called Manhattan, located south of the Las Vegas Strip. That year, the company purchased a 20-acre property in Spring Valley, Nevada (southwest Las Vegas), near the Las Vegas Beltway. The purchase cost $30 million, and was financed by Theraldson Financial Group. As of July 2006, Gemstone was planning to build a condominium project on the newly acquired land, under the name ManhattanWest. Like the earlier project, ManhattanWest would also contain 700 units. They would be housed in a nine-story tower and a series of four-story buildings. The mixed-use development project would also include office and retail space. ManhattanWest was designed by Denver-based Oz Architecture, while Apco Construction was the general contractor. Developer Alex Edelstein, the chief executive officer of Gemstone, was confident that the project would succeed despite a poor housing market in Las Vegas. Excavation work began on the site in April 2007. Vertical construction of the first phase ‚Äì three residential buildings and two commercial buildings ‚Äì was expected to begin in the third quarter of 2007. ManhattanWest was expected to begin opening during the third quarter of 2008, with full completion by mid-2009. Buildings in the project had Manhattan-inspired names, including Tribeca House and Gramercy House. The flagship nine-story building, known as Element House, would include 73 units, a fitness center, and a rooftop deck and lounge with views of the Las Vegas Strip and Red Rock Canyon. The two other residential buildings, as well as the two office buildings, were four stories high. The complex would ultimately consist of 12 buildings, and would include of Class A office space, as well as of ground-floor retail space. The project would feature approximately 30 retailers and four restaurants. By November 2007, the project had experienced strong pre-sales, despite the poor market. More than 50 percent of the first phase had sold out within the first six months, making it one of the best-selling condominium projects in the United States. Unit prices on the project had been raised five times up to that point, and construction was proceeding on a continuous schedule to get the first five buildings finished. One aspect of the project that garnered attention from prospective buyers was ManhattanMD, an on-site medical facility for residents. The project was expected to cost $330 million. Construction costs were low at the time because of decreased demand in the housing market. Edelstein remained confident in the project and had invested more than half of his net worth into it. Element House was topped off in August 2008. At the time, Edelstein had made a preliminary agreement with InterContinental Hotels to open a 120-room Staybridge Suites hotel at ManhattanWest, catering to business travelers. Camco Pacific Construction became the new general contractor in September 2008. Edelstein cited poor construction work by Apco as the reason for the change, and additional money had to be spent on reworking and rebuilding parts of the project that were deemed inadequate. The project had 58 building code violations, including faulty structural concrete and an inadequate fire safety system. At the time of the contractor change, Element House was 80 percent complete, while the Union Square commercial plaza was scheduled for completion later in the year. The first phase was scheduled for full completion around March 2009. Edelstein announced the suspension of construction on December 16, 2008, as financing was no longer available. The announcement was made during the Great Recession, and Edelstein said a primary reason for the suspension was \\"a mismatch of what it costs to build one of these things and what people are willing to pay for condos and office space.\\" He also blamed significant cost increases that were necessary to fix the earlier work done by Apco. Edelstein said these increased costs were what led to the lenders terminating the project's financing. He hoped to eventually acquire new financing to finish ManhattanWest. Edelstein had spent $170 million on the project, which was considered an eyesore in the years after work was suspended. The nine-story tower was vandalized, with glass paneling being smashed, while copper wiring was stolen from the building. More than $30 million in liens were filed against ManhattanWest following the suspension. A legal battle developed, involving the banks that financed the project and construction companies that were owed money for their work. By March 2009, Edelstein had talked with several groups that were interested in purchasing the project, but he said that none of them had any serious offers. Gemstone filed for bankruptcy in 2011. The H5 Group, founded by Ofir Hagay, was in the process of purchasing the project out of bankruptcy during 2012. Before the purchase could be approved by a bankruptcy judge, a creditor stated that the sale price was too low, prompting an auction in an effort to bring in a higher price. The Calida Group, a Nevada housing developer, was in the process of purchasing the project at the end of 2012. ===The Gramercy=== Krausz Companies, based in California, ultimately purchased ManhattanWest in June 2013, for $20 million. Krausz teamed up with WGH Partners, based in Las Vegas, to develop the unfinished project. Hagay was among the partners at WGH, which was also a co-owner of the project. The companies planned to spend an additional $30 million to finish the project, which would be renamed The Gramercy and would retain its New York theme. The companies planned to finish the residential units as apartment rentals rather than condominiums. Because of the legal problems associated with the project, it took more than a year to work out the issues and finalize the purchase. Some issues involving lienholders and lenders still remained after the sale, although these were not expected to have an effect on the project. WGH was interested in the project because of its size and design, and its location near the Las Vegas Beltway. Construction was underway again in March 2014, with Martin-Harris Construction as the general contractor. The first office and residential tenants were expected to begin moving in later that year. HMS Holdings signed a deal to become the first major office tenant, leasing in The Gramercy. Regus also signed on as an office tenant. Other tenants have included Bank of Internet USA, CalAtlantic Homes, and Liberty Mutual. WGH believed that there was strong demand in the area for restaurants, prompting the decision to include several eateries at The Gramercy. Retail was no longer planned for the project, and options were being considered for the decrepit nine-story tower. The Gramercy's opening was marked on November 6, 2014, with the installation of a 10,000-pound letter \\"G\\" sculpture. A decision was ultimately made to demolish the tower, as finishing it would be too costly because of the building code violations that would need to be addressed. Company executives also felt that the tower's blue glass exterior did not match with the rest of the project. The owners opted to have the tower demolished piece-by-piece, a process that would take months. Demolition began in mid-January 2015, with jackhammering on the top floor. However, the noise could be heard for several blocks away, and there were concerns that it would lead to complaints from office tenants and that it would cause disinterest in prospective apartment renters. A week after demolition began, the owners decided to have the tower demolished through implosion instead. In preparation for the implosion, the tower was stripped down to a bare frame of steel and concrete. The tower was imploded on the morning of February 15, 2015. The tower had an underground parking garage that extended east of the building by 60 feet. The garage's ceiling was demolished, and the implosion was planned so that the tower would collapse into the garage. It was expected to take four to six weeks to clear the debris and demolish the garage. Potential plans for the now-vacant property included building another tower, possibly with office space. A 90-foot-tall sign was installed at The Gramercy in March 2015. The Gramercy has 160 apartment units. A courtyard surrounds the various businesses located on the ground-floor, which includes restaurants and a fitness center. At the end of 2016, the last of the remaining office space was being prepared for incoming tenants. In April 2017, the two commercial buildings were sold for $61.75 million to two real estate firms, Koll Company and Estein USA, based respectively in California and Florida. The remainder of The Gramercy ‚Äì including the apartment buildings and 12.6 acres of vacant property and parking lots ‚Äì was sold to California-based developer Lyon Living in May 2018, for $45.75 million. The apartment units accounted for $37 million of the sale price. In September 2020, Lyon Living announced plans for a six-story apartment building with 294 units, to be built on the former land of the imploded tower as well as adjacent property. Construction is expected to begin by 2021. ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Residential buildings in the Las Vegas metropolitan area Category:Buildings and structures in Spring Valley, Nevada Category:2014 establishments in Nevada Category:Residential buildings completed in 2014 Category:Office buildings in Nevada Category:Office buildings completed in 2014 Category:Mixed-use developments in the United States Category:Buildings and structures demolished by controlled implosion Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2015 ","title":"The Gramercy"},{"id":"63938147","text":"Football Club Hajvalia 2020 (), commonly known as Hajvalia 2020, is a football club based in village Hajvalia of Pristina, Kosovo.

He was responsible for legislation that created Charles A. Lindbergh State Park and Camp Ripley. == Early life and career == Rosenmeier was born in Denmark sometime in 1874. When he was 14, he emigrated to the United States with his father. They settled in Kandiyohi County, Minnesota. He worked on the family farm until he was 21, helping to earn enough money to bring his mother and sister over from Denmark. During the winter months, he attended Willmar Academy. He passed the county school teacher exam in 1895, and subsequently taught in various rural schools for several years. He graduated from Mankato Normal School in 1901 and became principal of the school in Dundee. Rosenmeier made a decision to switch from a teaching career to a legal career and graduated from University of Minnesota Law School in 1906, as class president. Following his graduation, he moved to Royalton to practice law and founded the Rosenmeier Law Office in 1911. He relocated to Little Falls around 1914 following his election as Morrison County Attorney, a role he served for six years before he was elected to the Minnesota Senate for the 53rd district (encompassing Morrison and Crow Wing counties). The same year of his election, 1923, he was listed as president, trust officer, and director of the American Savings Trust Company of Little Falls. During his time as senator, he served as chairman of the Rules Committee and became majority leader of the Conservative caucus, a title he avoided using. He served in the Senate until his death. == Personal life == The Burton-Rosenmeier House Rosenmeier married primary school teacher Linda Bakken in August 1906.

Initially started as Intercultural and Diversity Studies of Southern Africa (iNCUDISA) at the University of Cape Town,http://www.sociology.uct.ac.za/usr/sociology/downloads/about/review_vol1.pdf page 97 - 101 WiCDS was then established at Wits in 2014 and aims to build capacity to meet the challenges of diverse societies, especially in post- apartheid South Africa through interdisciplinary postgraduate education and research. == Academic Programmes == The Centre presents three interdisciplinary programmes that can be undertaken by students from various disciplines, although most come from disciplines within the Humanities and Social Sciences. * BA Honours in Critical and Diversity Studies - this programme is done by coursework and research with the objective of developing and extending critical theoretical understandings of diversity issues in society through an introduction to diversity language and terminology. * MA in Critical Diversity Studies - through coursework and research, focuses on a deeper understanding of critical diversity and how it can be applied to professional and personal contexts, as something that is urgently necessary in all spheres of post-apartheid South African life and other global countries. * PhD in Critical Diversity Studies WiCDS is grounded in social justice imperatives, the research and education of the programme is informed by Melissa Steyn‚Äôs 2007 notion of Critical Diversity Literacy. The Centre has adapted the racial literacy concept developed by sociologist France Winddance Twine to analyse other axes of oppression, such as gender, sexuality, disability and class amongst others to describe the field of critical diversity studies as that which develops diversity literacy in scholars and researchers. The following are the ten criteria for critical diversity literacy: * An understanding in the role of power in constructing differences that make a difference. * A recognition of the unequal symbolic and material value of different social locations. This includes acknowledging hegemonic positionalities and concomitant identities such as whiteness, heterosexuality, masculinity, cisgender, able bodiedness, middle classness etc. and how these dominant orders position those in non-hegemonic spaces. * Analytic skill at unpacking how these systems of oppression intersect, interlock, co-construct and constitute each other, and how they are reproduced, resisted and reframed. * A definition of oppressive systems such as racism as current social problems and (not only) a historical legacy. * An understanding that social identities are learned and are an outcome of social practices. * The possession of a diversity grammar and a vocabulary that facilitates a discussion of privilege and oppression. * The ability to ‚Äòtranslate‚Äô (see through) and interpret coded hegemonic practices. * An analysis of the ways that diversity hierarchies and institutionalised oppressions are inflected through specific social contexts and material arrangements * An understanding of the role of emotions in all of the above. * An engagement with issues of the transformation of these oppressive systems towards deepening social justice at all levels of social organisation. Drawing on cutting edge social theory, the critical diversity studies lens opens up challenging research questions which emerge in the interstices of current disciplinary boundaries. These questions have the capacity to shift common sense assumptions about the social, enabling fresh and penetrating analyses of current social challenges. While no single research methodology need necessarily flow from critical diversity literacy, it involves the recognition of social construction and the constitutive role of discourse in employing critical social theory. The Centre also collaborates with Pitzer College in a study abroad programme offered by Pitzer in which undergraduate students come to Southern Africa for a semester long immersive experience in Tanzania, Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa. During their stay in South Africa, students are hosted by WiCDS. == Notable Events == Conferences - The Centre hosts annual international conferences. It has hosted 5 conferences thus far. These include Troubling seasons of hate, Decolonising feminism, Doing human, (Re)Imagining Liberations and Disabling Normativities. Notable people who have spoken at the conference include Lewis Gordon, Grada Kilomba, Boaventura De Soussa Santos,https://wits- enterprise.co.za/docs/2019-09-23_Final_23092019_Disabling_Normativities_Programme_Draft.pdf Shelley Tremain and Garth Stevens. Dialogue and debates * Distinguished Lecture Series * National Race Dialogues - the Wits Centre for Diversity Studies, in collaboration with the Ahmed Kathrada and Nelson Mandela Foundations hosted a National dialogue to talk about the ongoing challenges race and racism present to society. * Hardtalk Debating Series - launched in 2014, the Centre for Diversity Studies and the Wits Debating Union co-host an annual series of public, open debates that seek to stimulate youth engagement with topical and important social issues relating to diversity, leadership, and governance. * Talking Media Diversity Roundtables 2014 -the WiCDS & the Critical Media Diversity Studies Group presents a series of four round-tables for critical conversations around diversity of/in the media. Paul Chappell Disability reading group - a dedication to the late WiCDS researcher, Paul Chappell, hosted twice every month for students and staff, with and without disabilities. The group provides space for people to critically engage with disability research and its application within an African context. WiCDS Wednesdays - a series of monthly seminars that are held on the last Wednesday of the month to promote dialogue between the public and the Centre on a range of diverse topics that promote transformation within the society. HAYIBO! - a web series via YouTube presenting short videos, each portraying a different diversity issue currently playing out in South African society. Scenarios, which involved actors and members of the general public, deal with the Bystander Effect. HAYIBO! Intends to: # develop the capacity of individuals and communities to interrupt oppression, # identify and challenge the ways in which power relations linked to race, gender, sexuality, dis/ability, are expressed in everyday situations, # understand how silences operate to reproduce the social injustices that underlie systems of oppression. == Publications == The International Journal of Critical Diversity Studies (IJCDS) is a bi-annual, peer-reviewed journal that aims to provide a platform for critical engagement with hierarchies of power that create and sustain privilege and oppression along axes of difference. IJCDS contains book reviews, original research and theoretical articles, and is published in June and November. The journal serves an integral role of unlocking South Africa's national and global potential.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Delibegovic aims to use artificial intelligence to develop technologies that would allow mass-screening for coronavirus disease 2019. == Early life and education == Delibegovic is from Tuzla in Bosnia and Herzegovina. She grew up during the Bosnian War, which forced her family apart. In the early nineties, she moved to Scotland and finished her secondary school education at George Heriot's School in Edinburgh. Delibegovic studied pharmacology at the University of Edinburgh. In the final year of her undergraduate degree Delibegovic moved to Essex, where she did her undergraduate final year project at GlaxoSmithKline on novel anti-diabetes drugs. She completed her doctoral research with Dame Patricia Cohen at the University of Dundee Medical Research Council Protein Phosphorylation Unit. Here she studied the way that enzymes such as protein phosphatase 1 influenced diabetes development. She was supported by the Royal Society studentship. She has said that she was interested in diabetes because of family history and prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in Bosnia and Herzegovina. During her doctoral research, Delibegovic worked closely with pharmaceutical companies to translate her research to the read world. In 2003 she was awarded the American Heart Association personal fellowship to study the role of PTPN1 in glucose homeostasis at the Harvard Medical School in Boston, USA. She spent four years in Boston, working with Prof Benjamin Neel on mouse models of insulin resistance. == Research and career == In 2007 Delibegovic returned to the United Kingdom, where she was awarded the Research Councils UK 5-year tenure track fellowship to investigate obesity and ageing at the University of Aberdeen. She was made a Professor in 2015 at the age of 38. The focus of her research has focussed on the PTP1B phosphatase, the molecular mechanisms that cause diabetes and what the relationship is between diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. She has demonstrated that PTP1B can be used for targeted treatments, reaching the cells of specific organs without causing any side effects. In 2017 Delibegovic demonstrated a novel pharmaceutical, Trodusquemine, that could be used to treat type 2 diabetes and breast cancer. She went on to show that a single dose of Trodusquemine, the PTP1B inhibitor, could be used to reverse the effects of atherosclerosis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Delibegovic obtained funding from the Scottish Government/ Chief Scientist office to develop a diagnostic test that could support mass screening for coronavirus disease. Her long-term aim was to use artificial intelligence to identify which parts of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 activated the body's immune system. At the time, other coronavirus disease tests available in the United Kingdom would not support rapid deployment, and several were unreliable. As of May 2020, the tests developed by Delibegovic and her team were in development, and would be anticipated to be able to test for immunity in Scotland by winter 2020. == Awards and honours == * 2011 Royal Society of Edinburgh Young Academy of Scotland * 2018 Wellcome Trust Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Public Engagement in the Biomedical Sciences * 2018 \\"Super Zena\\" Award == Selected publications == * * * == Personal life == Delibegovic met her husband whilst a graduate student at the University of Dundee. == References == Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:British people of Bosnia and Herzegovina descent Category:Academics of the University of Aberdeen Category:Harvard University faculty Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Women virologists Category:British women academics ","title":"Mirela Delibegovic"},{"id":"63938603","text":"Marguerite Boucicaut Marguerite Boucicaut, n√©e Gu√©rin (born January 3, 1816 in Verjux, France, died December 8, 1887, Cannes) was a French businesswoman and benefactor.

Upon Aristide's death in 1877, Marguerite continued to run the store, even expanding it. The Boucicaut's treatment of their employees was novel for the time - a paternalistic relationship where the employees were given food, housing, entertainment, and education. In return, loyalty and adherence to a moral code (ironic given that the Boucicaut's relationship might have involved cohabitation before marriage).

(1820-1877) was a nineteenth- century author and cleric. In the later years of his life he founded and managed St. Mary's Orphanage, Blackheath, England, where he died on 24 July 1877. == Early life == The son of physician and president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) Charles Hawkes Todd (1784‚Äì1826) and Elizabeth Bentley (1786‚Äì1862), William was born on 1820 in Dublin, Ireland. He is the eleventh of fifteen children and the brother of James Henthorn Todd, Robert Bentley Todd, and Armstrong Todd. In 1831, Ireland experienced an epidemic of Asiatic cholera, which killed 5,632 people in Dublin and over 50,000 in Ireland. It also nearly killed William Todd and his mother, Elizabeth. There is unconfirmed evidence that William married. It is said that after he completed his doctor in theology in Rome, his wife joined a religious order. == Professional life == William Todd took holy orders in the Church of Ireland. With the help of his brother, Rev. James Henthorn Todd, William published two books: * The Church of St. Patrick: A Historical Inquiry into the Independence of the Ancient Church of Ireland (1844) * A History of the Ancient Church of Ireland (1845) William earned an A.B. from Trinity College in Dublin and was working on his doctorate. About 1845, Todd left the Anglican Church and joined the Roman Catholic Church. The motivation to change from Anglican to Roman Catholic was influenced by his oldest brother's colleague John Henry Newman and the Oxford Movement. Newman published a document called, \\"Remarks on Certain Passages in the Thirty-Nine Articles,\\" or Tract 90. Newman's argument centered on the idea that the identity of the Church of England was more Catholic than Protestant. While William's departure from the church created discord among Anglo-Irish Protestant family members, his older brother James had leanings in the same direction. Under the guidance of John Henry Newman, William transferred to Rome to complete his Doctor of Divinity. He subsequently became a Roman Catholic priest. His calling took him to the poorest parishes in London and London's Blackheath district1861 England Census, Greenwich West. District 17. Page 12 of 361871 England Census. Greenwich West. Page 15 of 38. His brothers Dr. Robert Bentley Todd, Dr. Armstrong Todd, and other family members worked nearby. About 1857, and under the direction of the Bishop of Southwark, William Gowan founded St. Mary's Orphanage for Boys at Park House, Cresswell Park, Blackheath, London. Residents arrived between 6 and 12 years old. They remained until they reached 14 or 15 years of age. The Very Reverend William Gowan Todd, D.D. died at St. Mary's Orphanage in his 57th year on 24 July 1877.

It is considered Critically Imperiled by NatureServe. The common name for the bee is derived from its distinctly blue color and its favored host plant, Calamintha ashei. == Etymology == The name \\"calaminthae\\" is Latin for mint, as the presumed pollen host for the bee is Calamintha ashei, commonly known as Ashe's mint. == Description == The adult female O. calaminthae ranges from in total length and has a forewing length of . The male is in length with a long forewing. The female is dark blue in color with some brown integument; the male has a pale blue head and mesosoma, dark blue metasoma, and some brown integument. The females, along with females of Osmia conjunctoides, are unique among North American Osmia (mason bees) for their short, erect, simple facial hairs utilized for pollen collection. File:Osmia calaminthae, holotype female (lateral).jpg Female File:Osmia calaminthae, male paratype (lateral).jpg Male == Distribution and ecology == Osmia calaminthae has only been observed at four sites, all of which were within a long, wide area of sandy Florida scrub located in southern Lake Wales Ridge in Highlands County, Florida. The majority of observations are from various undeveloped lots in Lake Placid. This makes it possibly among the most geographically limited and host-specific bees in eastern North America. While it is possible that the bee ranges further than has been observed, there has never been an attempt to comprehensively survey bees in Florida or document their hosts. The area of observation is also known for endemism. Florida scrub is a unique form of shrub environment located on ridges and knolls of wind-deposited sand. The bee depends primarily on Calamintha ashei as a pollen source. Individual C. ashei are known to live as long as a decade and are suspected to live longer. They bloom primarily in mid-March through mid-April. Since as few as 20 to 30 mature plants can present thousands of flowers, the species serves as a reliable annual food source for O. calaminthae. == Conservation status == Osmia calaminthae is very poorly known and its conservation status is not currently documented by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. It is listed as a \\"species of greatest conservation need\\" by the Florida State Wildlife Action Plan, and as of 2019 it has been listed as Critically Imperiled by NatureServe. In 2015, a petition was filed to the US Fish and Wildlife Service to evaluate the conservation status for the bee, and its status is now under review. The bee was described in 2011, and its habitat studied in 2016, but its continued existence was unknown until it was rediscovered in March 2020. Most of the known habitat for the bee is not protected and is subject to development. Pesticide drift and all-terrain vehicles are additional threats. == References == == External links == * * calaminthae Category:Endemic fauna of Florida Category:Insects described in 2011 ","title":"Osmia calaminthae"},{"id":"63938857","text":"Katarzyna Keahey is a Senior Computer Scientist at Argonne National Laboratory and the Consortium for Advanced Science and Engineering (CASE) of the University of Chicago.

Similar to the theories of relative deprivation, Lipset's theory concerns the belonging of individuals to collectives, their perceptions of their economic and social situation, and their mental state. According to Winkler, Lipset's theory, in which people who see their status as at risk are prone to supporting right-wight extremist movements, is very influential within this research.J√ºrgen R.

Falter puts the middle class thesis of the rise of Nazism into perspective. Falter found out that while indeed 40% of Nazi voters came from the middle class, the working class also represented a significant voter group. The most significant social characteristic of a Nazi Party voter was religious denomination, with Protestants voting for the Nazis much more than Catholics. In the 1990s, the term became a political buzzword in Germany, which was used alongside a criticism of society in general. With their positioning in the discussions about Leitkultur, multiculturalism, nation and immigration, the political and economic elites (and not the far- right parties themselves) are said to promote far-right ideas, and this prepares the way to an authoritarian society.Klaus Schroeder: Rechtsextremismus und Jugendgewalt in Deutschland, 2003, , pages 110‚Äì113 == See also == * Political spectrum * Extremism * Social class == References == Category:Sociology Category:Political terminology Category:Socioeconomics Category:Extremism ","title":"Extremism of the centre"},{"id":"63938904","text":"Royal Air Force Desborough or more simply RAF Desborough is a former Royal Air Force airfield located in Northamptonshire, England The following units were here at some point: * No. 102 Flying Refresher School RAF * No. 108 Elementary Gliding School RAF * No. 108 Gliding School RAF * No. 84 Operational Training Unit RAF * No. 1381 (Transport) Conversion Unit RAF ==References== Category:Royal Air Force stations in Northamptonshire ","title":"RAF Desborough"},{"id":"63938950","text":"Robert Shogan (September 12, 1930 ‚Äì October 30, 2013) was an American journalist and author.

In 1968 the painting was exhibited in the Tesori nascosti della Galleria di Parma exhibition, for which it was detached from its canvas mount, revealing a studies for a Saint Catherine and a Madonna and Child on the reverse. The art historian Ghidiglia Quintavalle theorised that the work was a late Parmigianino self-portrait, identifying it with \\"a coloured painting finished di lapis showing a self-portrait of the Parmesanino, 0.5 high by 4 tall\\", a work mentioned in a posthumous inventory of his studio. Augusta Ghidiglia Quintavalle, Tesori nascosti della galleria di Parma, Parme, La Nazionale Tipografia, 1968, 178 p. However, this identification remains in doubt, since the Parma work does not have Parmigianino's usual lead graphite \\"di lapis\\" finish. The work has been compared to the description of the artist's appearance in old age in Vasari's Lives of the Artists as \\"delicate and gentle, with long and battered beard and hair, almost a saviour, different from what had been\\". Its attribution to Parmigianino is almost unanimous among art historians and is upheld by Fagiolo dell'Arco (1970), Rossi (1980), Freedberg (1987), Di Giampaolo (1991), Gould (1994), Coliva (1998) and Chiusa (2001). Only Cirillo and Godi (1982) dissented, attributing it instead to Anselmi, with Cirillo switching it to the Parmigianino attribution in 1999. Although it has been exhibited as Self-Portrait of Parmiganino, the attribution to Anselmi has recently been re-advanced due to stylistic details such as the ruffled hair, the soft serpentine beard and the study of the saint on the reverse, which may correspond with Anselmi's Saint Jerome and Saint Catherine (Pinacoteca di Brera). ==References== ==Bibliography== * Pierluigi Leone de Castris, Parmigianino e il manierismo europeo [exhibition catalogue, Parma, Galleria Nazionale, 8 febbraio - 15 maggio 2003, Vienna, Kunsthistorisches Museum, 4 June - 14 September 2003], Cinisello Balsamo, Silvana editoriale, 2003, 431 p.

The interview received a lot of criticism and a debate about if one person can be held accountable for crime sprees in the suburbs.

The region was conquered by the Israeli army (IDF) at the end of the Yom Kippur War in October of 1973, and held by Israeli forces until the signing of the disengagement agreement on May 31, 1974. The Salient held by Israel shown in Crimson == History  Israeli occupation of the Salient: October 1973 === By the time the second ceasefire was imposed to end the Yom Kippur War, the IDF had conquered a 400 km2 salient into Syria. Known as the Bashan Salient due to its location in the Bashan region, the Israeli salient included many Syrian villages and several key military outputs. Most notably, it included several positions on Mount Hermon, which were within artillery range of the Syrian capital of Damascus.Benny Morris (May 25, 2011). Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881‚Äì1998. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. p. 396. . p.433, \\"Bashan ... 500 square kilometres... which brought it within 20 miles of Damascus\\" === Low-Intensity Conflict: November 1973 ‚Äì March 1974 === Northern Command Yitzhak Hofi is pointing at the map, while IDF Chief of Staff David Elazar is leaning on the map with both hands The Syrians, having lost strategic outposts on Mount Hermon in the Yom Kippur War and with their capital threatened, refused to accept the presence of Israeli troops on their soil. Despite the existing ceasefire, Syrian forces led numerous ambushes and firefights against the Israeli salient. According to Syrian Foreign Minister Abdel Halim Khaddam, Syria's constant artillery attacks were \\"part of a deliberate war of attrition designed to paralyze the Israeli economy\\", and were intended to pressure Israel into yielding the occupied territory.Jonathan B. A. Bailey. Field Artillery and Firepower. Naval Institute Press, 2004, p. 398. . Aerial engagements also took place, and both sides lost several aircraft during the escalating conflict. === War of attrition: March ‚Äì May 1974 === In February 1974, negotiations between Israel and Syria began under the mediation of Henry Kissinger, the US Secretary of State. Alongside these negotiations, the fight went on, slowly growing in intensity, with over 1,000 incidents between March and May. The Israelis called these incidents, which included the shelling of Israeli civilian settlements in Golan territory, the \\"War of Attrition in the Syrian Salient\\" or the \\"Little War of Attrition\\", to distinguish from the War of Attrition against Egypt in 1969‚Äì70. Due to harsh winter weather and logistical difficulties, the Israeli army removed the permanent garrison on Hermon Summit's outpost, relying on occasional patrols to secure the asset. The vacating of the outpost was noticed by the Syrians, who started paving a road toward the summit in late March 1974. For the two months of April and May 1974, in parallel to the armistice negotiations, the conflict in the salient escalated to days of almost full combat. On April 6, 1974, Israeli observation posts observed that Syrian commando forces had scaled the non-garrisoned Hermon summit. The IDF retaliated with artillery and airstrikes, and on that same night, a small Israeli force reached the summit and claimed it after a short firefight. After this incident, Israeli forces equipped for the harsh weather conditions were permanently stationed at the outpost. These forces took shelter in a natural cave near the summit. On April 16, 1974, the Israeli Engineering Corps completed a paved road to the summit, even while suffering heavy Syrian artillery bombardment, with a D-9 tractor becoming the first mechanized vehicle to ever reach the peak. After the road was complete, Israeli tanks and APCs were placed at the outpost, and its defenses were fortified. These armored vehicles would prove crucial in repelling Syrian attacks on the Israeli outpost on April 18‚Äì19, and again on April 22. Several aerial dogfights also took place over the salient at this time, with both sides losing aircraft. On April 27, 1974, the Syrians shelled one of the forts on the summit, killing eight Israeli soldiers and wounding seven. An Israeli Yas'ur helicopter sent to evacuate the wounded soldiers crashed on the mountain, killing the six crew members. The Syrians also shelled the surrounding forts, as well as the daily convoys bringing men and equipment. The Israeli Air Force retaliated with airstrikes on Syrian army camps on the slopes of the mountain. On May 1-2, 1974, Syrian commandos raided an Israeli tank park, killing two Israeli soldiers and taking several others prisoner. This raid proved to be the final Syrian military action in the salient. Golan Heights Yom Kippur War ribbon === The signing of the armistice === On May 31, 1974, a disengagement agreement was signed between Israel and Syria. In line with the agreement, Israel evacuated all its forces from Syrian territory, including the Hermon Summit outpost, in the following three weeks. Israeli forces returned to the pre-war Purple Line, which remained the de facto border between the countries, except for minor changes such as Israel's handing the abandoned city of Quneitra to the Syrians. A buffer zone was created on the Syrian side of the border held by UNDOF, a UN peace-keeping force, with Syria retaining the civil administration. This arrangement continues to the present day, with the Israeli-Syrian frontier among the quietest in the region. === Campaign medal === Israeli soldiers who served in the Bashan Salient for a period of at least 18 continuous days received the Yom Kippur War medal and ribbon. ==References== Category:Battles of the Yom Kippur War ","title":"War of Attrition in the Bashan Salient"},{"id":"63939061","text":"380px Adoration of the Magi is a c.1529 oil on panel painting by Parmigianino, now in San Domenico church in Taggia (province of Imperia, Italy).

(founded as La Vizcaya in 1878) was one of the largest Cuban conglomerates within the sugar and alcoholic beverages industries. Headquartered in C√°rdenas, Matanzas, it was particularly famous for the launch and production of the Havana Club rum from 1934 until 1960. ==History== C√°rdenas in 1900. Jos√© Arechabala Aldama established a distillery with the name La Vizcaya in 1878 in C√°rdenas, Matanzas, Cuba leveraging the molasses residue from sugar refining to produce rum and other liquors, on top of providing logistic services in the port of C√°rdenas (warehouses and sea transport). Its swift development allowed it to cope with the losses due to the Faquineto hurricane in 1888, which amounted up to 50.000 pesos of the time (around $US 2 million today). Its expansi√≥n continued despite the Cuban Independence war (where C√°rdenas was the first location bombed by the US Navy), the Cuban independence from Spain and the crisis that hit the island those years. The group continued growing, launching new businesses as they were required, all of them within the C√°rdenas vicinity, and increasing the community welfare, as it happened with the public lighting, started in 1889 and in which Jos√© Arechabala S.A. took an important part. By 1919, the group already included a power plant, sugar refineries and a barrel production facility, while the distillery was then producing daily 23.600 litres of rum and 80.000 litres of other spirits and still managed schooners and warehouses. All the businesses were incorporated under Jos√© Arechabala S.A. name on 18 January 1921. The founder became its first Chairman while his son in law (and nephew), Jos√© Arechabala Sainz (see Spanish naming customs), became Managing Director. The Arechabala facilities in the C√°rdenas shore (south of Varadero, just where the Hicacos Peninsula joins the mainland) extended over 150 acres. Jos√© Arechabala died on 15 March 1923 and his successor as Chairman (and still Managing Director), Jos√© Arechabala Sainz, was assassinated only a few months later, in September 1924. The subsequent successor, Gabriel Malet (another son in law of the founder) also died before long, in 1926. It was then when Tom√°s Pita y √Ålvarez (the third son in law of Arechabala) took over as the Chairman and Jos√© Ferm√≠n Iturrioz (who was also a member of the Arechabala family, as he was the son of one of Arechabala nieces, and he was his godson) was appointed Managing Director. At that time, Prohibition in the United States was still in force, preventing any alcohol exports to the largest market, albeit several negotiations with American authorities (in which Jos√© Arechabala S.A. participation was key) secured a 22% quota on sugar imports into the United States, to be split proportionally among the cuban producers. In 1932 Cuba exported 435.000 tons of sugar to the United States, 30% of which was Jos√© Arechabala S.A. Palacio de los Condes de Bayona, where Arechabala set its Bar Privado Havana Club, opposite to the Havana Cathedral. Just when the Prohibition was about to be repealed, another Category 5 major hurricane hit C√°rdenas. On 1 September 1933, the 1933 Cuba‚ÄìBrownsville hurricane reached the Matanzas shore causing numerous damages and hundreds of deaths. Arechabala suffered losses then in excess of 500.000 pesos. The company reacted swiftly and by the 19th march 1934 (festivity of St. Joseph, the founder‚Äôs patron) a new rum production plant was inaugurated, with the sole purpose of launching the Havana Club and Doubloon Rum brands, targeted for the American market. Arechabala Havana Club soon became the international benchmark for Cuban rum. On 29 May 1935 Jos√© Arechabala S.A. opened a new office building and its ‚Äò‚ÄôBar Privado‚Äô‚Äô (the ‚Äò‚ÄôHavana Club‚Äô‚Äô) across the Havana Cathedral. It soon became one of the key hotspots for locals and tourists in Havana, as Graham Greene let the protagonist James Wormold mention in its Our Man in Havana novel: ‚Äúat the Havana Club he felt a citizen of Havana‚Äù. Receptions to the Athletic Bilbao team that had recently won the Spanish League (in July 1935) or to the Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano officers when they laid over in Havana during their IX instruction cruise (in April 1936) were other examples of its popularity. C√°rdenas in 1955. During the 40s and the 50s the corporation continued its expansion into other businesses, such as fuel production, shipyard, jam factory, a yeast plant or even a bagasse paper mill. This time the leadership was in the hands of Carmela Arechabala, the eldest daughter of Jos√© Arechabala, who assumed chairmanship from 1946, something quite unfrequent for a woman in those times. By then, the corporation refined 1.000.000 pounds of sugar, purified 200.000 litres of water and distilled 125.000 litres of alcohol daily, while the fermentation section was able to handle up to 4.000.000 litres and the solera aged 2.000.000 litres of rum on an ongoing basis. In 1953, when the corporation celebrated its 75th anniversary, the Arechabala 75 rum was released, with over 10 years of ageing, and, at the time, represented the pinnacle of cuban rums, leveraging both the great Arechabala rum expertise and the best aguardientes and rums that had long been maturing in the solera. == Plunder and oblivion == On 31 December 1959, a group of armed med led by Calixto L√≥pez broke into the Arechabala offices and forced all staff to leave the facility under threats. Jos√© Miguel and Ram√≥n Arechabala, who were present, had to leave their posts, but not before they were inspected to prevent them from sneaking any important documents. A large part of the Arechabala family were abroad during the Christmas holidays and could never return to their homeland out of fear for reprisals. From that date on, a period of disregard and negligent management began, destroying in a very short time what had been a model of urban integration of a productive plant in an urban environment, with highly advanced landscaping and architecture for the time. The Cuban revolution abandoned the production assets, even giving away the aging barrels, turning into ruins the plant that had once been the pride of C√°rdenas and Cuba. The Bar Privado was abandoned and the production plants unoccupied. It was not until 15 October 1960, with the enactment of the ‚Äò‚ÄôLey 890‚Äô‚Äô, which nationalized through expropiation of all industrial and commercial assets, that the plunder of the corporation was official. The Arechabala family (the direct descendants of Jos√© Arechabala), which was still 100% owner of the corporation, never received any compensation for the nationalization. == Benefactora eminente == When Jos√© Arechabala S.A. unveiled the Arechabala Theater on 20 April 1919, the city of C√°rdenas was prompt in naming the founder Hijo Adoptivo, but the social works fostered by the firm did not stop there. On 19 May 1945, on the occasion of the inauguration of the Monumento a la Bandera that culminated the works on the C√°rdenas coastline that had been borne by Jos√© Arechabala S.A., the then President of the Republic, Ram√≥n Grau San Mart√≠n discovered a plaque that declared her as Benefactora eminente (Eminent Benefactor) of the city. These works had allowed the port of C√°rdenas to be dredged, making it a development pole for the region, enhancing its position as the closest port to the United States. That same day, Jos√© Arechabala S.A. was appointed Gran Oficial del M√©rito Comercial by the Cuban government. Additionally, Jos√© Arechabala S.A. conducted may other welfare works in the municipality, such as pavement of several streets, fire extintion services or the public lighting in the city. == Fringe benefits for workers == The Arechabala employees enjoyed fringe benefits that were unseen at the time, some of which would even today be considered extraordinary. The plant in C√°rdenas had a swimming pool, social club, children's playground, Balneario (seaside resort) or sport fields (including tennis , golf or bowling, among others), and in January 1945 another social club was opened in Varadero for the workers of Arechabala. Additionally, fringe benefits for employees provided by Jos√© Arechabala S.A. included: :- Professional Dental Service :- Canteen for workers :- Emergency Aid Savings Bank :- Sewing Academy for the families of the employees :- Scholarships for children of employees :- Pension Fund and retirements for employees :- Draw of 2 houses every year among Arechabala employees == Symbols == Jos√© Arechabala S.A. used from its very beginnings as la Vizcaya an emblem with the Biscay coat of arms depicting the oak tree of Guernica (Arechabala is a basque word that happens to mean \\"large oak tree\\") and the wolves representing the L√≥pez de Haro (founders of Bilbao), ‚Äò‚Äôravissant‚Äô‚Äô Arthur Fox-Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, T.C. and E.C. Jack, London, 1909, 196-197, https://archive.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxduoft. (i.e. carrying a lamb in their mouth) for their participation in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212. This symbol appeared on the labels of all Arechabala products (including the original Havana Club bottles) from the foundation of the distillery and adorned the barrels on the solera. From 1943 there was a change in the Havana Club image, as the label became blue and the emblem a combination in two panels of the Biscay coat of arms and the Bilbao coats of arms, with the San Ant√≥n Bridge. By the end of 1954 another image change was produced and the label returned to a similar version of the original one, with the oak tree of Guernica and the wolves. ==See also== * List of companies of Cuba * * * ==References== Category:Food and drink companies of Cuba Category:Drink companies of Cuba Category:Distilleries Category:Rums Category:Sugar companies ","title":"Jos√© Arechabala S.A."},{"id":"63939145","text":"Olutosin Araromi (born 1993) is a Nigerian-American model and beauty pageant titleholder, she was crowned Most Beautiful Girl in Nigeria Universe 2019.

It is also the only known site in Britain where the polychaete Armandia cirrhosa and the amphipod Gammarus insensibilis, both of which are at their most northerly known sites in the lagoons behind the seawall here. ===Birds=== The mudflats are used by a wide variety of birds to feed on. Flocks of brent geese, Eurasian wigeon and Northern pintail use the estuary in the winter while waders such as dunlin, black-tailed godwit and grey plover feed on the mud and roost in the marshes and shingle ridges. sandwich and little terns nest on the shingle ridges alongside black-headed gulls. Together with great cormorants these fish eating birds hunt their prey in the rich waters of the area. Birds of prey, such as Western marsh harriers, peregrine falcons, and merlins are attracted by flocks of wildfowl and waders. ==History== The marshes were originally used for salt production but this ceased in the 19th century and the land reverted to saltmarsh. ==References== Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Hampshire Category:Geological Conservation Review sites Category:National nature reserves in England Category:Nature Conservation Review sites Category:Ramsar sites in England Category:Special Protection Areas in England Category:Special Areas of Conservation in England ","title":"Hurst Castle and Lymington River Estuary"},{"id":"63939192","text":"220px Adoration of the Shepherds is a c.1521-1522 oil on panel painting by Parmigianino, now in a private collection.

NACA icing research leader from 1936 to 1945. Lew build his own de- icing systems on a Lockheed 12A and a Curtiss C-46 creating a flying de-ice laboratory. ==Biography== Lewis A Rodert Born 26 February 1906 to Emil Carl Rodert (1873-1959) and Etta Rachel Lewis (1869-1946) in Kansas City, Missouri, Lewis August Rodert was raised on a Kansas farm. At age 17, he graduated first from Garnett High School's Class of 1923. Rodert attended the Kansas City Junior College, then graduated with a Bachelor's degree from the University of Minnesota in 1930. His grandfather August Rodert invented a wind wagon for traveling on the plains. He taught aeronautical engineering at Duluth Junior College in Minneapolis, then he then worked for Curtiss Aeroplane & Motor Company in Buffalo, New York. Rodert started at the NACA's Langley laboratory in 1936. On 26 December 1937, he married Ellen Elizabeth Schumacher (1916-2003) and they had four children together: Linda; Charles; Merideth; Robert. Rodert transferred to the California Ames Laboratory in 1941. In 1948, working as Chief of the Flight Research Branch for the NACA's Cleveland laboratory, his aircraft fire prevention research focused on developing low volatility fuel called \\"safety fuel\\". In 1956 Rodert joined Lockheed in Burbank, California, as a special assistant on research management. Then battling mental illness, he faded from the aviation industry. The Roderts divorced in June 1967. Lewis A. Rodert died on October 11, 1973 at age 67 in Fresno, California. ==Aircraft thermal anti-ice development== NACA \\"Ice\\" wind tunnel used by Rodert In September 1936, Lewis A. Rodert joined the NACA Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory (LMAL) and working with Alun R. Jones, reworked the icing problem. The prevailing thought was that ice added weight and prevented aircraft from climbing out of the icing areas. The new research discovered that icing was much worse than just added weight. The ice changed the wing's airfoil shape, both decreasing lift and increasing drag. Additionally, instruments and carburetors iced over, causing faulty readings and choked engines. Ice adhearing to propellers further decreased engine & propeller performance. Ice covered windshields, jammed flight control joints, and cover antennas making radios almost useless. All the dangerous icing effects often occur within minutes. In September 1937 using a United DC-3, Rodert's team demonstrated that even small amounts of ice greatly affected lift, drag, and stall speed. This discovery resulted in construction of a large icing tunnel at Langley. Disappointingly, he discovered tunnel ice did not resemble natural ice formation. B.F. Goodrich Rubber Company developed an inflatable boot on the wing's leading edge that physically broke ice that was partially effective and good enough to become standard equipment in the late 1930s. Rodert and Jones successfully flight tested a US Navy Martin XBM-1 using excess engine heat to remove ice encouraged further development and testing. The NACA approved modifications to an all-metal Lockheed 12A and its use as a dedicated anti-ice test bed that also had the priority support of the Lockheed Company's Vice President and Chief Engineer Hall L. Hibbard. They diverted hot gasses from the engine to heat the leading wing edge from inside the wing while mixing in cool ram air to keep the metal from becoming too hot and weakening. By August 1939, the design was mature and being tested on an operational US Navy PBY flying boats. The Navy Bureau of Aeronautics helped modify the Lockheed 12A design to fit the PBY. In November 1939, the U.S. Army Air Corps (USAAC) ordered the Lockheed 12 to Wright Field for testing. At Wright, Major C.M. Cummings of the Equipment Branch helped Rodert finalize the design. The USAAC bought new wings and a modified windshield for $25,000 from Lockheed for the NACA for research. Lockheed fabricated the wings and Rodert moved the Flight Research Branch to the Ames Laboratory next to the Navy's Moffett Field in California. The Ames based team used a North American O-47 for tests until the 12A was ready from the Lockheed factory on 22 January 1941. In December 1947, US President Harry S. Truman congratulated Lewis A. Rodert of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on the 1946 Collier Trophy for the design, development, and practical application of a thermal aircraft anti-icing system that year's greatest achievement in American aviation. President Truman had a personal interest in fellow Missourian Rodert winning the 1946 Collier Trophy, the President's plane, The Independence, a Douglas DC-6, was one of the first production models utilizing a thermal de-ice system. Pressurized cabins allowed aircraft to fly above icing levels and improved ground de-icing fluids helpd diminish the ice hazards. Satisfied with his de-icing work, Rodert turn to his new crusade: reducing the hazard of aircraft post-crash fires. == References == == External links == * Category:1906 births Category:1973 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Kansas City, Missouri Category:1933 in aviation Category:20th-century American inventors Category:American aerospace engineers Category:American manufacturing businesspeople Category:Aviation inventors Category:Aviation history of the United States Category:Aviation pioneers Category:Collier Trophy recipients Category:University of Minnesota alumni ","title":"Lewis A.

The incident happened during a war game of the Iranian Navy in the Gulf of Oman. During this incident, 19 crew of the Konarak were killed with 15 wounded. The Konarak was heavily damaged and its wreckage towed to Chabahar Port. == Incident == Iranian frigate Jamaran On 10 May 2020, the ship was struck by a Noor missile, an upgraded YJ-83, which was fired from the in the Gulf of Oman close to the Strait of Hormuz. Official Iranian TV initially reported one fatality in the incident, but this was later revised to 19 killed and 15 injured. The Konarak was involved as a tender, setting out targets for target practice for missiles from Jamaran. The Konarak reportedly failed to distance itself sufficiently from the target prior to the launch and was struck by a missile. The missile may have automatically locked onto Konarak as the largest target or else been set as the target by human error. After the incident, Konarak was recovered to port to undergo a \\"technical inspection\\".

His oil paintings and works on paper showed a wide range of subjects. He made cityscapes and street scenes, seascapes and beach scenes, bucolic landscapes and farm scenes. He drew famous dancers, society figures, and both urban and rural men at work. As one critic put the matter, \\"He has the rare quality of making whatever subject he essays interesting and unusual, be it bouquets of flowers, riders in six-day bicycle races, Spanish dancers or straight American landscape.\\" He achieved acclaim for pictures he made while living in New York and during extensive travels. In 1918, a critic said his drawings showed the kind of \\"bold pen outline\\" and gift for \\"incisive statement\\" that could be seen in work by British caricaturist, Thomas Rowlandson. Another critic noted a \\"sensuous, aristocratic nostalgia\\" in Sprinchorn's urban scenes, describing them as \\"delicate, suggestive impressions.\\" Throughout much of his career Sprinchorn's floral paintings in oil, pastel, and watercolor also attracted critical attention. Reviewing watercolors exhibited in 1928, a critic praised a \\"subtle relation of colors\\" in a floral work and said that \\"if colors could sing,\\" these would \\"chant melodiously.\\" Sprinchorn made extensive visits to camps and hamlets in the North Maine Woods and the paintings and drawings he made there came to be his most celebrated works. Regarding a cluster of posthumous exhibitions held in 2002, a critic wrote, \\"In Sprinchorn's hands, the Maine woods come alive through the actions of men who are most comfortable among the trees: hunters, trappers, lumberjacks and river drivers, mostly. These large, rugged images are full of earthy colors that recall the blue-chill of winter, the blaze-orange glow of autumn and the shadowy scenes that accompany nighttime campfires...\\" Writing in 2002, a biographer wrote of a contrast between the sophisticated urban focus of much of Sprinchorn's work and the unsophisticated rural focus of his output from the forests of Maine. Calling him a \\"composite of opposites,\\" she said he was as much at home in the New York art world with its sophisticated artists and wealthy patrons as he was in rural boarding houses and lumber camps. ==Early life and education== In a 1974 letter to a friend Sprinchorn said he had determined to emigrate from Sweden after reading about an inspiring teacher named Robert Henri. Although he was just fifteen when he set off for New York and although he spoke only Swedish, he knew that one of his older sisters--then working as a maid to a family in Manhattan--would help him make the difficult transition after he arrived. He landed in New York on October 30, 1903, and enrolled in the New York School of Art eight days later. Sprinchorn later said that his study under Robert Henri was the most important factor in the development of his career. Although Henri knew no Swedish, Sprinchorn advanced quickly in his studies by means of gestures and eye contact to understand Henri's critiques of his work. For his part, Henri considered Sprinchorn to be one of his best students. In 1909 he said that Sprinchorn knew virtually nothing about art when he began but he quickly learned to paint with \\"virility and character.\\" ==Career in art== Sprinchorn's career began while he was still a student. After a little more than two years of study, he was awarded two honorable mentions for a drawing and paintings that were shown in an exhibition of school work at the New York School of Art. Early in 1907 a painting of his called \\"A Winter Scene on the East Side, New York,\\" was accepted by jurors for the National Academy of Design annual exhibition, but, following a protest from Henri regarding other paintings that had been rejected, the academy decided not to hang Sprinchorn's, giving lack of space as the reason. Angered by the decision Henri said the Academy should not rebuff innovative young artists like Sprinchorn. He praised Sprinchorn for catching \\"a big new note\\" and placing it upon canvas \\"with haunting effect\\" and added that he knew of \\"few more promising painters.\\" A few months later a critic for the New York Sun discussed Sprinchorn's paintings that were hung in another of the New York School's student shows. He praised a Sprinchorn painting called \\"Ferryboat in Snowstorm,\\" saying that it violated \\"every canon of academic art\\" in showing \\"things as they are.\\" Another critic said Sprinchorn was a promising artist whose work was \\"painted with a feeling of largeness.\\" Early in 1908 he contributed paintings to an exhibition of work by Henri and his students at the National Arts Club. Of a Sprinchorn painting called \\"Winter Day,\\" a critic wrote, \\"It is realism pushed to the eleventh degree. No mercy is shown to optical sentimentalists.\\" Sprinchorn followed Henri when, in January 1909, he founded a school of his own and then left the following year to pursue a career as a professional artist. Between 1907 and 1909 Sprinchorn had served as manager of the New York School of Art and he continued to serve that function during his time in the new Henri school. At this time a critic saw Sprinchorn as \\"one of the younger members of the new 'revolutionary' school of artists, who, as a body, have met with so little encouragement from the juries of the National Academy of Design.\\" Early in 1910 Sprinchorn had a painting accepted for the 105th annual exhibition at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and a little later he exhibited at the Rand School in New York along with Henri and men who had studied under Henri. The list of participants included George Bellows, George Luks, and John Sloan. Although he usually lived in New York, Sprinchorn traveled widely throughout his career. During late 1912 and early 1913 he lived in Los Angeles, California. During 1914 and 1915 he lived in Paris where he attended sketch classes at the Acad√©mie Colarossi. He often spent summer months in artists' colonies near the water: in Provincetown, Massachusetts, in Ogunquit, Maine, and on Monhegan Island, Maine. He returned to Scandinavia from time to time to paint and visit with his family. In 1910 he made his first visit to a location in north-central Maine that would soon become a favorite. He was invited by a family friend to visit Monson, a town where there was a small community of Swedish immigrants. During the winter months Monson was home to the camps of loggers who took advantage of swollen streams and rivers to transport wood to lumber mills further south and east. Having previously become known for scenes of blizzards and heavy snowfall in the slums of Manhattan, Sprinchorn seems to have felt comfortable depicting the work of these loggers and the environment in which they spent the cold months of the year. As his career matured Sprinchorn would re-visit Monson and other locales in the North Maine Woods over the next three decades and would spend most of his time there in the years between 1942 and 1952. At the time of his death, Sprinchorn's paintings, drawings, and watercolors from the Maine forests would come to be seen as his dominant subjects and most popular works. While in southern California between 1912 and 1914, Sprinchorn taught at the Art Students League and served for a time as its director. In 1915 he was one of eleven \\"representative American painters\\" selected for an exhibition in the main gallery of the fine arts building at the Panama-California Exposition in San Diego, California. Later that year he participated in a group exhibition at the New York MacDowell Club and the following year showed drawings in a solo exhibition sponsored by George S. Hellman. In reviewing the latter, a critic for the New York Sun said he drew with spirit and grace, with a youthful quality that the critic found refreshing. In 1918 he showed drawings again in an exhibition at the Scandinavian Art Shop. On this occasion a critic recognized an affinity to English artist Thomas Rowlandson but noted that Sprinchorn saw things in a more fragmentary manner, in angles rather than curves, and with more biting humor. The critic concluded by saying Sprinchorn was \\"amazingly skillful in obtaining the richest and most splendid results by holding back the full force of his pigment, and suggesting reserves of color behind the surface painting.\\" Sprinchorn showed three times in 1920, once with other Swedish-American artists at the American-Scandinavian Foundation, once with a group that included Anne Rector at the National Arts Club, and once in an exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists. In reviewing the first of the three, a Times critic said Sprinchorn contributed \\"two large paintings of great distinction\\" and drawings that were even stronger. The year 1922 was a fruitful one for Sprinchorn. In January Hamilton Easter Field's journal, The Arts, printed an article by the literary theorist Kenneth Burke called \\"The Art of Carl Sprinchorn.\\" Burke analyzed Sprinchorn's technique in detail. Drawing attention to his use of visual metaphor, Burke said he used abstraction to make his subjects serve multiple purposes in his paintings. As an example, he said \\"Carl Sprinchorn begins with snow, and adds something else, while the snow remains. He manages to put on his canvas both the object and his interpretation of it.\\" In that month and the next Sprinchorn showed watercolors and drawings in the Junior Art Painters gallery and paintings and works on paper in Mrs. Sterner's gallery. In later months the Worcester Art Museum gave a solo exhibition of his recent work. At the end of the year he participated in a group show at the New Gallery that he had himself assembled. The show at the Sterner Gallery drew extensive critical examination from The Arts magazine, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, and New York Herald newspapers. In The Arts, literary theorist Kenneth Burke said that in eliminating detail Sprinchorn achieved a \\"truer interpretation\\" of his subjects. In the Brooklyn Daily Eagle Hamilton Easter Field wrote that he shared the enthusiasm of Sprinchorn's \\"most ardent admirers.\\" TheNew York Herald's critic said of Sprinchorn's work, \\"It's abstract, but it's healthy and fine.\\" In his introduction to the catalog of the exhibition, the art critic, curator, and collector, Christian Brinton, described what he saw as Sprinchorn's \\"eager, ceaseless odyssey in quest of fresh plastic and chromatic stimulus.\\" Between 1922 and 1925 Sprinchorn was art director of the New Gallery which exhibited and sold works by little-known American artists and avant-garde European ones. His works were frequently shown in group exhibitions during the 1920s and early 1930s: at the New Gallery in 1923 and 1924; at the Whitney Studio Club in 1924; at the Brooklyn Museum in 1925, 1926, 1928, and 1929; at the Marie Sterner Gallery in 1928, 1930, and 1933; at the Roerich Museum in 1929; and at the Fifty-Sixth Street Galleries in 1930. He held solo exhibitions during these years at his own studio (1924 and 1933), the Rhen Galleries (1927), the Ainslie Gallery in 1928, the Penthouse Gallery (1930), and the Sullivan Gallery (1936). The American Swedish Historical Museum gave him a solo exhibition in 1942. In 1930 the owner of the Sullivan Gallery, Mrs. Cornelius Sullivan, organized a tour of his work in three museums. In the decade following 1920 The Dial magazine published many of his drawings and he also earned income for illustrations he produced for the Ford Motor Company. Sprinchorn used his earnings from his job at the New Gallery and other sources to fund a year and a half of travel in Puerto Rico and Santo Domingo in 1926 and 1927. Afterward, he returned to Sweden late in 1930 and early in 1931. He stayed in New York most of the time between 1931 and 1937. His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics. His work also appeared at the Whitney Museum in the second biennial exhibition in 1936 and in the annual exhibition of contemporary art in 1938. Using the money he received from sales of his art, he spent part or all of the year in Maine between 1937 and 1943, mostly living either in Patten or Shin Pond. In January 1943 Sprinchorn wrote the collector and museum director, Duncan Phillips, asking him to see the Macbeth Gallery exhibition of his works. Phillips subsequently purchased one of the paintings, \\"Snow Winged Horses\\" (1920) thus helping to fund subsequent winters in the Maine woods. During these years he showed infrequently, notably in solo exhibitions at the Macbeth Gallery (1943, 1947, and 1950), the Bertha Schaeffer Gallery (1944). As his health declined after 1950, he continued to show work from earlier decades, but painted less frequently. He lived in Manhattan from 1950 until 1956 when he moved to a farm in Selkirk, New York. The galleries in which he showed during that period include the Bertha Schaefer, Passedoit, Zabriske, and Knoedler galleries in New York. He stopped exhibiting in 1963 and died eight years later. In 1984 the art museum at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, mounted a retrospective called \\"Carl Sprinchorn: Realist Impulse and Romantic Vision.\\" In 1994 the Veilleux Gallery in Farmington, Maine, showed 60 paintings and works on paper from the Maine woods. A news account said that 44 of the 60 found buyers making this the most successful exhibition his work ever received. The gallery, which represented Sprinchorn's estate, held a second retrospective in 1996. An exhibition called \\"The Art of Carl Sprinchorn: The Katahdin Collection\\" appeared in the Ogunquit Museum of American Art in 1998. Three exhibitions were held in Maine during the summer of 2002: \\"Carl Sprinchohn: King of the Woods\\" at the Bates College Museum of Art, Lewiston, \\"Carl Sprinchorn: The Maine Woods and Beyond\\" at the Veilleux Gallery in Farmington, and \\"The Four Seasons: Carl Sprinchorn in Maine\\" at the New O'Farrell Gallery, Brunswick. Despite his affection for snowy landscapes and pictures of winter occupations, Sprinchorn was never completely at home in rural Maine. One local resident, Caleb Scribner, became a friend, but Scribner was an exception. They met one another in 1937 when Sprinchorn stayed as a boarder in the home of Scribner's family in Patten, near Shin Pond. An amateur artist, Scribner could converse with Sprinchorn on topics that held no interest for other locals. In a 1946 letter to a friend Sprinchorn admitted that he had little in common \\"with these people who after all are not important in my life over and above the accident of sharing a roof tree and board--with them; in no sense or manner able to share my interests, problems or what not.\\" Writing in 1988, Sprinchorn's biographer, Mary Towley Swanson, called him a \\"composite of opposites.\\" He enjoyed city life and developed enduring friendships with artists and patrons in the New York art world. Throughout most of his career critics gave most of their attention to his still lifes and other indoor subjects and the few existing records of his art sales show greatest interest in this work. Yet throughout his career, he spent long periods in rural settings, and after his death critics and curators showed a strong preference for his rural paintings. Toward the end of his career Sprinchorn addressed this dual aspect of his work. In a letter to his friend Richard Sprague he wrote, \\"Well, I'm a city boy. I mean I'm country- born, but I am city-minded.\\" In 1953 he wrote a friend: \\"I have been called a mystic. I think that I have a pantheistic spirit towards nature that prevents mere copying of nature. I have never been successful in copying nature, however sincerely, I soon got tired. I like to select and interpret nature after living close to the sources of nature‚Äîbut conversely, I have been interested in the life of critics, in the sophisticated aspects of life in general‚Äîin a word, I have tried to encompass a great deal.\\" ===Artistic style=== Carl Sprinchorn, After a Storm, 1906, oil on canvas, 22 x 28 inches Carl Sprinchorn, Lady With a Fan, 1909, watercolor, 9.75 x 7.5 inches Having accepted Robert Henri as teacher and mentor, Sprinchorn adopted a realist style that was then considered to be revolutionary. In defiance of decorous academic art and escapist impressionist art, the painters who studied under Henri chose subjects from the gritty urban world around them, painted with bold freedom and rapid brushwork, and strove for an immediacy of emotional expression. In reviewing an exhibition in which his first paintings were shown, a critic said Sprinchorn's \\"Ferryboat in Snowstorm\\" offended art authorities by violating \\"every canon of academic art.\\" Another said a painting of his offended \\"sentimentalists\\" by pushing realism \\"to the eleventh degree.\\" The 1906 painting, \\"After a Storm\\" also called \\"After a Snow Storm\\" (at right), shows Sprinchorn's style at this time. Early in his career, Sprinchorn's works on paper attracted at least as much attention as his oil paintings. As already mentioned, he received honorable mention for a drawing in 1906, showed drawings in a 1908 group exhibition, and in 1916 had his first solo exhibition devoted to drawings. Some years later, he recalled how favorably the New York press responded to this work and said that the solo exhibition produced a large number of purchases. Sprinchorn followed Henri in his style of drawing as much as in his oil paintings. Henri told his students to make drawings not as dispassionate draftsmen but expressively and with a deep consciousness of the whole of the subject. In 1916 a critic for the New York Sun called attention to Sprinchorn's abbreviated lines and use of simplification and noted the \\"spirit and grace\\" of his drawings. Noting in Sprinchorn's drawings \\"a keen vision and a witty analysis,\\" a critic for the New York Times said in 1918 that the artist was \\"amazingly skillful in obtaining the richest and most splendid results by holding back the full force of his pigment, and suggesting reserves of color behind the surface painting.\\" In the early 1920s critics continued to stress his simplicity, directness, and intensity of feeling. They recognized a rejection of strictly representational presentation in favor of the compositional elements of his work. One saw in his technique a \\"genuine aesthetic sensibility\\" and another cited his ability to transform subjects into meaningful symbols. In 1920 a critic for the Times wrote that Sprinchorn showed his talent most clearly in his drawings. The critic called them \\"vivid, syncopated sketches,\\" that told \\"within their narrow boundaries more truths about color and form that most artists find it possible to say upon their biggest canvases.\\" In 1922 a critic said the drawings were \\"expressed in spirited line and subtly modulated passages of blue, purple, pale yellow, and green. Full of genuine aesthetic sensibility, as well as a certain sensuous, aristocratic nostalgia.\\" The same year, writing in The Arts magazine, a critic wrote that he prized \\"composition for its own sake,\\" and had \\"almost a disdain for subject matter. He cited as an example Sprinchorn's treatment of human figures as \\"hardly more than theses, men without destiny or destination.\\" Sprinchorn's \\"Lady with a Fan\\" (shown at left), shows his technique of line drawing with watercolor wash. Carl Sprinchorn, Hunter's Luck, about 1937, oil on canvas, 26 1/8 x 34 1/8 inches Carl Sprinchorn, Gloria October, 1946, oil on canvas, 26 x 34 inches Carl Sprinchorn, Sunflowers and Tritoma, 1935, oil on canvas, 24 x 20 inches Sprinchorn's style changed little during the rest of his career, so little that critics writing in 2002 could echo what critics had written in the early 1920s. Both sets of critics saw freedom and boldness in his artistic sensibility and an approach that was expressive and abstract rather than objective and representational. They used terms like \\"free and bold\\" or \\"free and responsive\\" to describe his style. Both early and late in his career he was seen as imparting what one critic called \\"symbolic emphasis\\" in his work. Early and late, he was seen as a subtle colorist and was frequently cited for a forcefulness what one critic called \\"vigor and drive.\\" In all periods, critics saw an emotional content in his work which one called \\"expressionism with abstract elements.\\" In a post-career summation of his work a critic said what distinguished Sprinchorn's style was his \\"ability to set down an image with brutal personal honesty, as if he could do nothing else.\\" Another wrote that while he \\"was committed to the authenticity of his subject matter, he used means similar to those employed by an abstract artist, including figure and ground relationships that diverge from normal perspective; expressive use of color; and a painterly application of paint that demonstrates relish for the act of painting.\\" Sprinchorn's paintings, \\"Hunter's Luck II\\" (shown at right) and \\"Gloria October\\" (shown at left, illustrate these aspects of his style. Throughout his career Sprinchorn's media were oil paintings on canvas and works on paper in watercolor, pencil, pen, wash, crayon, and charcoal. His subjects varied widely: cityscapes of New York and landscapes of the Maine woods and tropical settings; human figures, including city laborers and rural woodsmen, as well as urban sophisticates; Scandinavian farm scenes; floral still lifes. Although his pictures of the Maine woods drew most attention after his death, he was better known for his still lifes and drawings during most of his career. Sprinchorn's \\"Sunflowers and Tritoma\\" (shown at right) illustrates is handling of a floral still life. In 1936 a critic said this painting was the liveliest of the \\"vivid flower paintings\\" he showed at the Sullivan gallery. ==Personal life and family== Sprinchorn was born in the village of Broby, near Kristianstad, Sweden, on May 13, 1887. His father was Claes Sprinchorn (1845-1907), a cabinetmaker who did carpentry and restored furniture. His mother was Johanna Rudolphsson (Andreasdotter) Sprinchorn (1844-1932). He was the youngest of seven children. As a child he liked to draw and, as already noted, determined to emigrate to New York so as to study under Robert Henri. In 1956, as ill-health restricted his ability to paint and draw, he moved to the home of his sister, Mrs. Anna Johnson, in Selkirk, New York. At his death in 1971 his only known survivors were Mrs. Johnson and a niece, Mrs. Ruth Olson, also of Selkirk. == Notes == ==References== Category:1887 births Category:1971 deaths Category:20th-century artists Category:Modern artists Category:Swedish emigrants to the United States Category:Olympic competitors in art competitions ","title":"Carl Sprinchorn"},{"id":"63939542","text":"Dayo Oyewusi (born c. 1966) is a Nigerian badminton player.

The Act did not give blanket powers for a tribunal of inquiry to be set up ad hoc. For a tribunal to be established under the Act, the matter in question would need to be one of urgent public significance; and would need to be authorised by the Secretary of State. If these prerequisites were met, such an inquiry would be established with judicial powers ‚Äì in the same way as the High Court or the Court of Session in Scotland. ==History of the Act== On 4 March 1921, the Tribunals Of Inquiry (Evidence) Bill was introduced in Parliament and in just under 3 weeks, became law. The Act received Royal Assent on 24 March 1921 and came into force immediately. On 22 February 1921, a controversy came to a head which involved certain high‚Äìranking officials at the Ministry of Munitions who were supposed to have summoned the heads of ledger departments and accounts investigators to order them to conceal papers from the Exchequer and Audit Departments. The papers, which were alleged to have been destroyed, related to the outcome of certain investigations regarding the entitlement of contractors, and involved sums in the many millions. The disappearance of the materials would serve to be monetarily beneficial to the officials. During a House of Commons debate of 22 February 1921, Captain Loseby claimed that there were sworn affidavits from those who witnessed the order to destroy being given. In trying to ascertain what had happened to the papers, the formation a new committee was advanced as a possible solution. The Committee would be chaired by a judge. It naturally followed that the question should be posed as to whether it would be necessary to have an Act of Parliament in place in order for the proposed Committee to be able to hear evidence on oath. As a result of the House of Commons debate of 22 February, plans were set in motion for a succinct piece of legislation that would enable the proposed Committee to take evidence on oath, this engendered the Tribunals Of Inquiry (Evidence) Bill. ==See also== *Inquiries Act 2005 ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 (repealed) Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1921 Category:United Kingdom tribunals ","title":"Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921"},{"id":"63939692","text":"Benjamin ‚ÄúBen‚Äù Clymer (born 1982) is an American businessman known as the CEO and founder of Hodinkee, a luxury watch and lifestyle website.

The company developed a web platform for connecting travelers with licensed pilots flying non-commercial, general aviation aircraft, allowing the cost of the flight to be shared pro- rata. The company closed in December 2015, following a ruling by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) banning the practice of flight sharing in the United States and an unsuccessful appeal by Flytenow to the Supreme Court of the United States. ==History== Flytenow, a flight-sharing service, was founded in 2013 by two pilots, Matt Voska and Alan Guichard in Boston, Massachusetts.Flytenow on Crunchbase. Flytenow's business model was based on a common and long-standing practice among pilots ‚Äì sharing expenses with their passengers to make flights on small aircraft more cost-effective.Pilot privileges and limitations: sharing expenses. Under long-standing FAA rules, pilots and passengers may each pay an equal share of gasoline costs, fees, and other expenses so long as they are traveling to the same location for independent purposes.Flying Magazine (Jun. 1969), p.113¬ß 61.113 Private pilot privileges and limitations: Pilot in command. The company aimed to build a database of licensed pilots offering their personal flights on non-commercial aircraft to the general public. Notably, as pilots did not earn money on Flytenow, they simply were able to share their flight expenses, pro-rata, for pre-planned flights. Travelers could search for select flights between destinations that were being offered by pilots on the service. Flytenow provided travelers with information on each flight and its pilot including their license type, experience, and past flight ratings. This would allow the traveler to fly on small private planes for a reduced cost and would allow participating pilots the ability to defray some flight expenses. Flytenow charged a connection fee to travelers for each flight. On February 12, 2014, Flytenow submitted an official FAA Chief Counsel request for legal interpretation of its services. ==FAA ruling== Flytenow was shut down by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in August 2014 along with other flight sharing companies, namely AirPooler and PilotShareTheRide.com. The FAA ruled that pilots offering their planned flights online and receiving pro rata compensation were classed as a \\"common carrier\\" similar to Delta Air Lines or American Airlines.Legal interpretation (2014). Although common carriage is not defined by regulation, FAA Advisory Circular No. 120-12A describes common carriage as \\"(1) a holding out of a willingness to (2) transport persons or property (3) from place to place (4) for compensation or hire.\\"AC 120-12A. FAA. The FAA ruled that by posting specific flights to the Flytenow website, a pilot participating in the Flytenow service would be engaged in common carriage because online posts constituted holding out services to the general public and receipt of shared expenses constituted compensation. This ruling meant pilots using Flytenow would be subject to regulations akin to commercial airlines requiring heightened safety requirements, U.S. Department of Transportation Economic Authority approval, and other more stringent requirements.AC 120-49A. FAA.a Part 135 Operation: A Guide to Applying for Charter Certification (NBAA). Flytenow, with the help of The Goldwater Institute, a conservative policy think tank, challenged the FAA ruling to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals - D.C. Circuit. Flytenow argued among other things that sharing expenses did not constitute compensation within the meaning of \\"common carriage\\" because long standing case law defines compensation as an \\"enterprise for profit\\". Flytenow asserted that receiving pro rata shared expenses did not amount to an enterprise for profit and therefore pilots could not be classed as a common carrier. On December 18, 2015, the FAA ruling was upheld by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals - D.C. Circuit. Flytenow appealed the Circuit Court's ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. On January 9, 2017, the Supreme Court declined to hear Flytenow's case.What can be learned from the Supreme Court‚Äôs denial of the FlyteNow v. FAA writ of certiorari?. January 11, 2017.

He was the second son of James Abercrombie Burden Jr. (1871‚Äì1932) and Florence Adele Sloane (1873‚Äì1960). His older brother was James Abercrombie Burden III, and his younger sister was Florence \\"Sheila\\" Burden (the wife of Blake Leigh Lawrence, a descendant of the Chanler, Winthrop, and Astor families). After his father's death in 1932, his mother remarried in 1936 to Richard M. Tobin, a banker who had been the American Minister to the Netherlands under President Calvin Coolidge. His father's family had organized and ran the Burden Iron Works in Troy, of which his father served as president from 1906 until his death. His paternal grandparents were Mary Proudfit (n√©e Irvin) Burden (daughter of Richard Irvin) and James Abercrombie Burden (son of Henry Burden). His uncle, Arthur Scott Burden, was the first husband of Cynthia Roche (the daughter of the 3rd Baron Fermoy and Frances Ellen Work, and a sister of the 4th Baron Fermoy, a grandfather of Diana, Princess of Wales). His niece, Adele Burden Lawrence, married the prominent writer Louis Stanton Auchincloss. His maternal grandparents were William D. Sloane, the head of W. & J. Sloane, and Emily Thorn Vanderbilt (a daughter of William Henry Vanderbilt and granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt). His aunt was Emily Vanderbilt Sloane. Burden graduated with an A.B. degree from Harvard College in 1922, followed by a master's degree from Columbia University in 1926. In 1922, John Singer Sargent did a charcoal portrait of Burden. ==Career== The Komodo dragon diorama in the Hall of Reptiles and Amphibians at the American Museum of Natural History. Shortly after graduating from Harvard, Burden went to the Far East on an expedition to bring back specimens for the American Museum of Natural History which led to the establishment of the Department of Animal Behavior in 1928. He was elected to the Board of Trustees of the museum in 1926. He led expeditions to various tropical islands and the Arctic, but his most well known expedition was to the Island of Komodo in the Dutch East Indies in 1926. Along with his first wife Catherine and their party, he went looking for Varanus komodoensis, a direct descendant of the dinosaur which today is better known as the Komodo dragon. By using sapling traps baited with buffalo meat, Burden was the first \\"white man\\" to find and trap the giant lizards who weighed 350 pounds and were approximately 10 feet long. They also collected 3,000 insect and amphibian specimens. Of the three they captured, two of the Komodo dragons were given to the Bronx Zoo, but died soon thereafter and were mounted in the new Hall of Reptiles and Amphibians at the museum. In 1930, he co-wrote and produced, with William Chanler as part of Burden-Chanler Productions, the silent film entitled The Silent Enemy starring Chief Buffalo Child Long Lance. Along with Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, Sherman Pratt, and Ilya Andreyevich Tolstoy (grandson of Leo Tolstoy), Burden founded and served as president of Marineland, one of Florida's first marine mammal parks in St. Augustine, Florida in 1938. The park was conceived as an oceanarium that could be used to film marine life. During World War II, he developed a shark repellent for the U.S. Navy. ===Published works=== In 1927, he wrote a book about the expedition to Komodo Island entitled The Dragon Lizards of Komodo. Burden's chapter \\"The Komodo Dragon\\", in his book, Look to the Wilderness, published in 1956, describes the expedition, the habitat, and the behavior of the dragon. In 1960, Burden wrote Book to the Wilderness. ==Personal life== Burden was married three times with his first and second ending in divorce. His first marriage was to Katherine Curtin White (1902‚Äì1976), a daughter of Ernest Ingersol White and Katharine Curtin (n√©e Sage) White, in 1924. Her uncle, Horace White, had been Governor of New York in 1910. Before their divorce, they lived at East 72nd Street in Manhattan and were the parents of: * Katharine Sage \\"Wendy\\" Burden (b. 1927), who married Walter Denegre Sohier. They divorced and she married the journalist Edward P. Morgan. * William Douglas Burden Jr. (1931‚Äì2008), who was one of America's top ski racers, competing internationally, until a near-fatal ski racing accident in Italy in 1954 ended his career. His life partner was Marilyn Hodges Wilmerding. * Andrew White Burden (b. 1935), who married Meta Craig Paumgarten, a daughter of Harald Paumgarten, in 1962. His wife died in a tragic avalanche on the back of Ajax in 1972. After their divorce, Katherine married Dan Platt Caulkins (who had previously been married to a daughter of banker Seward Prosser) in 1939. He married secondly to Elizabeth (n√©e Chace) Gammack (1911‚Äì2013) in 1940. Elizabeth was a daughter of Malcolm Greene Chace and the former wife of Thomas Hubbard Gammack. Before their divorce, they were the parents of one son, Christopher Burden. After their divorce, Elizabeth married Grenville Temple Emmet (a son of diplomat Grenville T. Emmet) in 1973. His third, and final, marriage was in 1971 to Jeanne Wells (n√©e Wight) Booth (1922‚Äì1995). Jeanne, the former wife of John Welles Booth, was a daughter of George Houghton Wight and Vida (n√©e Johnson) Wight. Burden died in Charlotte, Vermont on November 14, 1978. He was buried at Grand View Cemetery in Chittenden County, Vermont. After his death, his widow remarried to Dunbar Bostwick in 1983. Bostwick was the widower of Burden's cousin, Electra Webb (a daughter of James Watson Webb, Sr. and Electra Havemeyer Webb). ===Descendants=== Through his daughter Katharine, he was a grandfather of the photographer and educator Katharine Sage Sohier (b. 1954). Through his son Andrew, he was a grandfather of Princeton University graduate William Douglas Burden III (b. 1965), who became a decorated Olympic rower. ==See also== * Vanderbilt family ==ReferencesResults of the Douglas Burden Expedition to the Island of Komodo. 1, Notes on Varanus komodoensis.

It was one of the first architectural organisations worldwide to bring a feminist approach to architecture and the design of the built environment and to challenge patriarchal spatial systems. Matrix pursued these objectives through built projects, theoretical analysis, commissioned research and publications, including the book Making Space:Women and the Man-made Environment. The book explores relationships between gender and architecture, building on the then emerging work from feminist geographers and historians in the UK and USA, including Doreen Massey, Linda McDowell, Susana Torre and Dolores Hayden. == Early years == Matrix originated as a feminist offshoot of the New Architecture Movement (NAM) in London. In the late 70s a group of women involved in NAM began meeting separately to discuss feminist perspectives and specific issues facing women in the built environment. This led to the formation of the Feminist Design Collective (1978‚Äì80) which then split into Matrix and Mitra. The latter focusing on enabling more women into the architectural profession; whilst Matrix focused on changing existing practices. Related groups include the Women in Manual Trades (WAMT) a pioneering charity supporting women in construction, and the Women's Design Service, founded in 1985. Matrix had many contributing members involved across a range of projects and affiliated groups between 1978 and 1994. These included the Women and Space conference (1979), the Home Truths exhibition (1980), the Matrix book group (1980‚Äì84), the Matrix support group (1980‚Äì84), and the architectural practice (1980‚Äì1994). Key members include Frances Bradshaw, Susan Francis, Barbara McFarlane, Anne Thorne and Jos Boys, among many others. Many of the founding members lived in squats or short-life housing while the collective was active, which meant living costs were minimal and energy could be directed to the work of the collective. == Architectural practice == The Matrix Feminist Design Cooperative design cooperative was a women-led and multi-racial architectural practice. Set up as a workers‚Äô cooperative, it was run using a non-hierarchical management approach. The practice specialised in collaborative ways of working with people, groups and organisations that were traditionally excluded from architectural design processes. The type of projects undertaken by the practice also extended beyond the range of standard architectural services, to include design guidance and training support. Along with other architectural organisations at the time across the UK, Matrix provided 'technical aid' to community and women's groups. The aim of Community Technical Aid Centres (CTAC) was to provide free or funded support services in a locality such as in construction, how to obtain funding, create neighbourhood organisations and building projects, and how to campaign for change. Methods for working with clients stemmed from Matrix's founding commitments to involving women in the design and production of buildings. Women from the practice used models and building visits to empower their clients to share in making design decisions. The Cooperative also provided courses on technical drawing for trainee tradeswomen, on the building process for workers and client groups, and on building law, casting general structures and construction for practising tradeswomen. A course on technical drawing that started as a consultative tool for Dalston Children's Centre was developed further for use on women builders' training schemes, particularly at Women's Education in Building (WEB), a group delivering projects on behalf of Learning and Skills Councils in West and Central London. Some of this work helped the development of a Women into Architecture and Building (WIAB) access course at the Polytechnic of North London (later University of North London, then London Metropolitan University) founded by Yvonne Dean with many women from Matrix involved as tutors, and with Matrix co-founder Susan Francis as course leader for a number of years. == Built work == Built projects include: * 1988-90: Half Moon Young People‚Äôs Theatre, Tower Hamlets: conversion of Poplar Town Hall * 1988-90: Grosvenor Terrace Housing, Southwark new build housing for single homeless people. * 1987-88: Pluto Lesbian and Gay Housing Co-operative, Islington: housing conversions * 1986-88: Jumoke Training Nursery, Southwark London (Ref - Owens, Ruth, Childcare Challenge: Building Feature: Jumoke Nursery * 1984-87: Jagonari Educational Resource Centre, Tower Hamlets: new build for Asian women‚Äôs organisation including cr√®che and large kitchen. * 1984-85: Hackney Women‚Äôs Centre: shop conversion * 1984-85: Dalston Children‚Äôs Centre, Hackney: conversion of disused baths Matrix are well known for the Jagonari Educational Resource Centre, a project for women from the largely Bangladeshi community of Whitechapel, London. An unsuccessful application was made to list the Centre in 2018. Matrix were a member of the Association of Community Technical Aid Centres (ACTAC) and gained funding from the Greater London Council to provide technical advice. The GLC enabled over 40 voluntary organisations which benefitted women to develop their premises. Client organisations included Brixton Black Women‚Äôs Centre, The Calthorpe Project, Bermondsey Women‚Äôs Centre, Hackney Asian Women‚Äôs Centre, Maxilla and Defoe Nurseries, Lambeth African Women‚Äôs Centre, Haringey Women‚Äôs Training/Education Centre and Charterhouse Women‚Äôs Project. == Publications == Matrix produced a range of publications, including the books Making Space: Women and the Man Made Environment (London: Pluto Press, 1984) and two pamphlets funded by the GLC Women's Committee A Job Designing Buildings: For Women Interested in Architecture and Buildings (London: Matrix Feminist Design Co-operative, 1986) and Building for Childcare: Making Better Buildings for the Under-5s (London: Matrix Feminist Design Co-operative, 1986). == Impact == Matrix were part of a much bigger second wave international feminist movement in the 1980s and 90s that campaigned to increase the number of women going into the architectural profession, to challenge conventional design practices and to enable women influence the design of built space. They were contributors to the seminal Paradise Circus: Women and the City film shown on Channel 4 in 1988, directed by Heather Powell for the Birmingham Film and Video Workshop. Matrix led and took part in many events of the period, including Women and Space at the Architectural Association in 1979, ‚ÄòWomen‚Äôs Realm‚Äô (Feminist Architects‚Äô Network, North London Polytechnic 1987) and Alterities, a major international conference in Paris on feminism and architecture in 1999. Exhibitions of their work include: * Drawing on Diversity: women, architecture and practice at RIBA Heinz Gallery, 1997 * AA XX 100 Women in Architecture 1917-2017, in 2017, with an associated publication edited by Lynne Walker and Elizabeth Darling * Still I Rise: feminisms, gender, resistance at Nottingham Contemporary, * Arnolfini Gallery Bristol, 2019 * De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill, 2019 * Making Space: Housing Feminism and Urban Change at Guest Projects London, 2019 Matrix has had ongoing impact on feminist approaches to design and participatory design methodologies, and is an important precursor to later feminist groups and organisations. Recognition is increasing, the editors of Women and the Making of Built Space in England, 1870-1950 describe Making Space as ‚Äúhighly important but underrated.‚Äù Founding members of Matrix went on to have significant roles in British architectural practice and as educators, campaigners and researchers. Individuals of the collective and connected to Matrix have continued to work with others around feminism, gender and architecture throughout their careers, including the all-female practice Anne Thorne Architects others work writing important reports for the RIBA on gender and diversity.. Some developed feminist spatial practices such as through Taking Place formed by Jos Boys, Julia Dwyer, Sue Ridge, Jane Rendell, Doina Petrescu, Katie Lloyd Thomas, Brigid McLeer, Helen Stratford, Miche Fabre Lewin, Angie Pascoe and Teresa Hoskyns. Spatial practice was also developed by the Julia Dwyer and Sue Ridge partnership. Jane Rendell has expanded research and writing surrounding feminism and architecture, Jos Boys has worked extensively on disability and architecture. The impact of the collective was reinforced in 2019 and 2020 when Matrix was nominated for the RIBA Gold Medal Award by Harriet Harriss. In 2020, the Matrix online archive project received seed funding from the University College London Bartlett Innovation Award. == References == Category:Women architects Category:Feminist organisations in England Category:British architects Category:English architects Category:Architecture academics Category:Women's history ","title":"Matrix Feminist Design Co-operative"},{"id":"63940706","text":"\\"(Nothing Serious) Just Buggin'\\" is the debut single by American hip hop/R&B; group Whistle, from their 1986 eponymous debut album.

(2014). \\"Avian sleep\\". Current Biology. 24 (1): R12‚ÄìR14. Birds restore their arousal thresholds during sleep. During their short eye-open periods, sleeping birds can mobilize almost instantaneously when threatened by a predator. Avian species have been found to rely on flock size and height for predatory precautions. Between the eye-opening and group sleep, these precautions allow sleep to be beneficial and safe. The amount of sleep necessary to function can vary by species. Pectoral sandpipers migrate from the Southern Hemisphere to the Arctic Circle, their mating ground (where they breed during daylight. Since the sandpipers are polygamous, they mate (or search for a mate) for the duration of daylight. Males do not require as much sleep during this time; some have been observed to give up 95 percent of their sleep time during the nineteen mating days.Lendrem, D. W. (June 3, 2006). \\"Sleeping and vigilance in birds, II. An experimental study of the Barbary dove (Streptopelia risoria)\\". Most act similarly to humans when sleep- deprived, getting them into potentially life-threatening situations or slowing their migration speed.Jiang, Y.; Chai, Y.; Yang, F.; Xu, S.; Basner, M.; Detre, J. A.; Dinges, D. F. & Rao, H. (2018). \\"Effects Of Sleep Deprivation And Recovery Sleep On Human Brain Network Organization\\". Sleep. 41 (suppll): A85‚ÄìA86. == Comparative anatomy of avian brain and nervous system == The typical avian nervous system is similar to that of mammals. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord, and a peripheral nervous system consists of nerves and sensory organs. Key attributes have evolved compared to other species, especially vision; avian visual capabilities are believed to be more advanced than any other group of vertebrates. In addition to larger eyes, birds have larger-than-average optic lobes. With a larger, more intricate optic lobe, some bird species can view the ultraviolet (UV) spectrum (beyond the visual range of the human eye). This UV visual capability facilitates hunting, as seen in nighthawks. UV-sensitive cone opsin is typically responsible for avian ability to see UV, but some species have circumvented this; owls can see UV light, but lack opsins. They compensate for this with essential enzymes which allow heightened rod sensitivity.Rattenborg, N. (2006). \\"Evolution of slow-wave sleep and palliopallial connectivity in mammals and birds: A hypothesis\\". Brain Research Bulletin. 69 (1): 20‚Äì29. UV is seen by several other animal groups, including cats and insects (where it has appeared to evolve in response to predator-prey relationships). Trade-offs in anatomy and physiology are common, and this is seen in the olfactory lobes of most avian species. Possibly due to the larger-than-average optic lobes, avian olfactory lobes are relatively small; few bird species use smell to find food. Falcons and eagles do not tend to have larger cerebellums for flying. According to comparative neuroanatomy researcher Ludwig Edinger, avian brains consist mostly of basal ganglia (responsible for instinctive behavior, rather than behavioral plasticity). Scientists have challenged some of Edinger's findings, and called for the renaming of avian nervous-system organs to reflect their similarity to those of mammals. ==REM and slow-wave sleep== Avian sleep shares two similarities with that of mammals: rapid eye movement (REM) and slow-wave sleep (SWS). REM sleep is believed to have an important effect on motor functions and memory storage. EEGs show high-amplitude and low-frequency waves during REM sleep; SWS tends toward lower-amplitude, higher-frequency waves, and is believed to be a form of deep sleep. During SWS, membrane potentials in the neurons of the neocortex oscillate slowly. A number of avian species exhibit unihemispheric slow-wave sleep: the ability to rest one half of the brain in SWS, while the other half appears to be awake. This type of sleep has also been seen in dolphins and whales. The organism is typically able to keep one eye open during this process, which allows added vigilance in high-predation environments.Rattenborg, Niels C.; Lima, Steven L. & Amlaner, Charles J. (1999). \\"Facultative control of avian unihemispheric sleep under the risk of predation\\". Behavioural Brain Research. 105 (2): 163-172. The evolution of this trait in birds and aquatic mammals is of interest to researchers because of the pressures involved. Unihemispheric SWS is thought to have evolved in aquatic mammals because they must return to the surface for oxygen; it is believed to help birds avoid predation, demonstrating homoplasy in the two groups. == Dove experiment == In a study of how the Barbary dove's sleep patterns are affected by flock size, D. W. Lendrum intended to prove that larger flocks reduced overall vigilance, and the apparent increase in predation risk of a smaller flock would harm the doves' sleep cycle. At the beginning of the study, the doves were caged alone or in pairs of cages containing two, three or six. They were then placed in one of two environments. In the calm environment, Lendrum walked alone past the cage between 10 am and noon; in the aggressive environment, Lendrum walked past the cage with a domesticated ferret at the same time of day. Lendrum discovered that the birds in the calm environment spent substantially more time with their eyes closed than those in the aggressive environment. Lendrum collected data on the doves' opened- and closed-eye sleep; flocking was associated with an increase in a bird's overall eye-closure time and a decrease in its amount of eye-opening. In the presence of a predator, Lendrum found that the doves exhibited higher levels of individual vigilance and increase in open-eye sleep; this reduced the active-sleep component of their total sleep time. == Perch height == Predators are believed to play a large role in an organism's sleeping patterns. To adapt to predation, two common techniques have evolved: positioning oneself out of harm's way while sleeping, and sleeping more lightly (such as unihemispheric sleep). In birds, perch height is believed to play a significant role in sleep; lower perch height has been shown to reduce the number and length of REM sleep episodes in pigeons, and a higher perch increases REM sleep and decreases slow-wave sleep.Tisdale, R. K.; Lesku, J. A.; Beckers, G. J. L.; Vyssotski, A. L. & Rattenborg, N. C. (October 1, 2018). \\"The low-down on sleeping down low: pigeons shift to lighter forms of sleep when sleeping near the ground\\". Findings also suggest that the time spent awake by pigeons increases when nesting on lower perches. Lower perch height correlates to a higher risk of predation; REM sleep would place the pigeon in more danger, since it is a less reactive form of sleep. == Light pollution == Light is one of the more common threats to sufficient sleep for birds living in anthropogenic environments, known as \\"artificial light pollution at night\\" (ALAN). ALAN eliminates darkness, a necessity for rest. Disrupting the birds' light and dark cycles can impact circadian rhythms, eventually harming sleep patterns. Biologist Thomas Raap conducted a study which suggested that exposure to ALAN affected the sleep behavior of Eurasian blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus).Raap, T.; Sun, J.; Pinxten, R. & Eens, M. (2017). \\"Disruptive effects of light pollution on sleep in free-living birds: Season and/or light intensity-dependent?\\". Behavioural Processes: 144. In this study, birds woke up earlier due to ALAN factors such as seasonal timekeeping. Because light usually indicates a day's passage to birds, exposure to light pollution disrupts their ability to measure the length of a day. Outside densely-populated areas, there is normally about a five-percent drop in sleep duration for blue-tit females during their nesting period. The researchers found a 50-percent reduction in the females' sleep duration during this period in urban centers, and suggested that the effects of ALAN were responsible. == References == Category:Sleep Category:Birds Category:Bird behavior ","title":"Avian sleep"},{"id":"63940710","text":"Risteska is a surname.

Not all details of his life are known to history, but it is known that he defended Negotin from a heavy Turkish onslaught in 1813 that ended a long siege on the citadel. Karaƒëorƒëe entrusted Hajduk Veljko and his three lieutenants, Stojan Abra≈° and Veljko's two brothers Milutin and Milko Petroviƒá, to defend a fortified place and entrenched position on the frontier between Serbia and the Ottoman Empire. The great battles around Negotin began in the summer of 1813 when hajduk Veljko's brother Milutin was the first to encounter the Turks who appeared near Kladovo and attacked the villagers as they were hastily engaged in carrying their valuables into the mountains. Milutin dispersed the Turks but was unable to pursue them in recapturing all the booty and prisoners they took. On hearing of this, the leaders scoured the country while awaiting the enemy. They drove hundreds of cattle into the citadel of Negotin, and their men penetrated as far as Vidin. Near Bukovac, Stojan Abra≈° together with the other leaders put to flight the first Turkish troops which appeared on the Timok. But when the Turks arrived with 18,000-strong, Abra≈° and Veljko and his brothers were obliged to ensconce themselves together with their men up in Negotin from where they made sorties, day after day, and night after night, keeping the besiegers constantly unease. Compared to the losses he inflicted on them, their losses were significantly less. Although with time, both the Serbs and the Turks were obliged to seek reinforcement ‚Äì the Turks from the Grand Vizier and Veljko from Karaƒëorƒëe and the Senate. According to German historian Leopold Ranke, a total of more than 18,000 Turkish soldiers attacked the 3,000 Serbs defending Negotin. Stojan Abra≈°, Veljko and his brothers ordered the fortification of Negotin, made a trench, built towers and waited for the Turks. The Turks were not long being unassisted, Redchep Aga, the Wallachian Prince Caradja, and the Grand Vizier himself led on a reinforcement. They made their way under cover of the night and by mining nearer and nearer to the fortification. They battered down with their cannons one tower of Negotin after another, and lastly the highest called Baba Finka, which was the residence of his commander Veljko himself. Yet Abra≈° and others kept fighting and when they ran out of bullets everything of lead or tin which he could find in the place he melted into balls, including coins, utensils, lamps, and kept off the enemy for a day longer. After several such onslaughts over three weeks, the expected reinforcements that the Serbs awaited never arrived. On 20 July 1813, after more than twenty days of continuous Turkish shelling and frontal attacks, the Negotin citadel was left in ruins with dead bodies everywhere, including brave Stojan Abra≈° who was killed along with other leaders and all the rest of the freedom-fighters. ==Literature== * –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∞ –ø–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏—á–Ω–∞ –µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—ò–∞ (Serbian National Encyclopedia) ==See also== * List of Serbian Revolutionaries == References == Category:1780 births Category:1813 deaths ","title":"Stojan Abra≈°"},{"id":"63940997","text":"Horace Sedger (1853‚Äì1917) was an American-born British theatre manager and impresario. He was particularly associated with light opera, and presented works by composers including Isaac Alb√©niz, Edmond Audran, Ivan Caryll, Alfred Cellier, Charles Lecocq and Andr√© Messager and librettists including W. S. Gilbert, Arthur Law and B. C. Stephenson. His most successful productions were Cellier's Dorothy (1886), which ran for an unprecedented 931 performances, and an English adaptation of Audran's La cigale et la fourmi (1891). Sedger was later active in the fledgling cinema industry. ==Life and career== Sedger was born in Rochester, New York, the son of Joseph Sedger, a distiller, and was intended for a commercial career.\\"Mr Horace Sedger\\", The Era, 27 February 1892, p. 11 He was sent to study in Paris at the Lyc√©e Chaptal, where he was a schoolfellow of Augustus Harris. At the age of seventeen he went to work at the London Stock Exchange, quickly becoming a senior clerk to a leading firm, a post he held for five years. In 1878 he married Harris's sister Nelly, an actress. Their only child, Daisy, born in 1879, followed her mother into the acting profession. Compelled by illness to leave his job, Sedger took a long sea-voyage, which inspired him to go into the newly developing Canadian meat- shipping business. He also tried his hand as an auctioneer and estate agent, but failed and was bankrupt for a short time in 1880. For the benefit of his wife Sedger secured a lease of the Novelty Theatre in Great Queen Street, London, in December 1883, and during his connection with it he made his debut as an actor. He then joined Edgar Bruce in producing Andr√© Messager's La Bearnaise at the Prince of Wales's Theatre. In November 1886 Bruce sold the twenty-one-year lease of the theatre to Sedger, who had a record-breaking hit with the light opera Dorothy by Alfred Cellier and B. C. Stephenson, which ran at the Prince of Wales's and two other West End theatres for an unprecedented 931 performances.Gaye, p. 1530 Like Harris, Sedger established a relationship with the Carl Rosa Opera Company; he presented their successful production of the light opera Marjorie by Walter Slaughter at the Prince of Wales's in 1890. In the same year he also took on the lease of the Lyric Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue, where in 1891 he presented an English adaptation of Edmond Audran's op√©ra comique La cigale et la fourmi, which ran for 423 performances.Traubner, pp. 89‚Äì90 Over the next few years he followed this with other light operas: The Mountebanks (1892) by W. S. Gilbert, Cellier and Ivan Caryll; Incognita (1892), an adaptation of Charles Lecocq's Le coeur et la main; The Magic Opal (1893) by Arthur Law and Isaac Alb√©niz; The Golden Web (1893) by Stephenson, Frederick Corder and Arthur Goring Thomas; and Caryll's Little Christopher Columbus (1893). Some of these were critical and artistic successes, but overall they lost money, and in 1896 Sedger was once again in the bankruptcy court.\\"Horace Sedger's Affairs\\", The Era, 14 June 1896, p. 6 Sedger continued in theatre management. In 1898, together with Arthur Eliot, he presented a revival of Slaughter's Alice in Wonderland at the Opera Comique and the following year he became embroiled in a dispute with Oscar Wilde. Wilde had agreed that Sedger should present his next play, but was angered when Sedger prematurely announced that the play (which was never written) would shortly be staged.Nelson, p. 216 In the 20th century Sedger moved into film, in partnership with Edward Laurillard, opening a cinema at Marble Arch in 1909.Betts, Ernest. \\"When films came to Wardour Street\\", The Times, 20 September 1967, p. 6 They later opened the 2,000-seat Brixton Palladium Picture Playhouse (1913).\\"A Clergyman on the Cinema\\", The Times, 21 March 1913, p. 2 Sedger's wife died in 1897.

On 22 June 2018, Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud was appointed emir after the assassination of former emir Mullah Fazlullah in a US drone strike in Afghanistan. Mehsud took power over the TTP at its weakest point since its inception, as the TTP no longer holds territory in Pakistan and has been plagued by internal divisions. Despite this, the TTP, since Mehsud's appointment appears to have been revitalized and has \\"grown deadlier\\". The US classified Mehsud as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist on 10 September 2019. In July 2020, Mehsud was included on the ISIL (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee list by the United Nations. ==Early lifeBirth=== Noor Wali Mehsud was born on 26 June 1978 in a village in the Tiarza Subdivision of the South Waziristan region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He hails from the Mechikhel sub-clan of the Mehsud tribe, a Pashtun tribe native to the Sararogha Subdivision of the South Waziristan region. ===Religious Education and Afghan Civil War=== Throughout the 1990s, Mehsud studied on and off at madrasas Jamia Imdadia, Jamia Haleemia and Jamia Farooq-e-Azam in Faisalabad, Jamia Nusratul Uloom in Gujranwala, and Jamia Ahsan-ul-Uloom and Jamia Yaseenul Quran in Karachi. Around 1996-1997, Mehsud's religious education was interrupted as he left to Afghanistan to fight alongside the Taliban and allied jihadist forces against Ahmad Shah Massoud's Northern Alliance. He fought in various battles during the latter phase of the Afghan Civil War like the Battles of Mazar-i-Sharif (1997‚Äì98) and battles north of Kabul. On his father's advide, Noor Wali Mehsud returned to Pakistan to finish his religious education, graduating in 1999. Upon graduating, Mehsud started using the title mufti denoting his Islamic religious scholarship. Over the next two years, Mehsud taught Islamic theology at Madrassa Imdad-ul-Uloom in the Gorgoray area in South Waziristan. ==War on TerrorUnited States invasion of Afghanistan=== Following the 2001 September 11th attacks and the subsequent United States invasion of Afghanistan, Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud returned to Afghanistan with a convoy of Deobandi Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) fighters lead by Maulana Mirajuddin Mehsud in hopes of propping up the Taliban regime. Despite the efforts of foreign jihadists, the Taliban government was overthrown by US and Northern Alliance forces in December 2001, prompting Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud to retreat across the border into Pakistan, along with droves of Afghan Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and other jihadist fighters. Over the next year, Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud, along with many other jihadists and jihadist sympathizers in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, sheltered fleeing Taliban and Al-Qaeda fighters, providing them a launching pad for their insurgent operations in neighboring Afghanistan. Under pressure from the US, Pakistan began deploying troops throughout the FATA and along the border with Afghanistan with the goal of apprehending jihadists seeking shelter in Pakistan. This move was considered an unprecedented violation of the tribes's sovereignty and was condemned by many parties across Pakistan. Throughout 2002-2003, Pakistan began to intensify their military presence and began launching counter-terrorism operations within the FATA, only to be met by more condemnation and suspicion by various local tribes and political parties. In addition, the local Pashtun tribes began to feel that they were being subjugated by the Pakistani military. Not only was their military presence a violation of their sovereignty, but according to Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud, Pakistan's demand for the release of the jihadists whom they sheltered would be a violation of the principle of Melmastia (hospitality), a major component of Pashtunwali (Pashtun tribal code). It was in this environment, Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud saw the need for a \\"defensive jihad\\" in Pakistan to resist American imperialism. Noor Wali joined the Mehsud branch of the Pakistani Taliban in 2003, shortly before the start of the War in Northwest Pakistan. ===War in Northwest Pakistan=== Early insurgent activities Fighting broke out on March 16, 2004 when the Pakistani army began an operation to clear out Al-Qaeda jihadists from the Wanna area in South Waziristan, being met with fierce resistance. In this battle, Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud lead local Taliban fighters in an ambush of the Pakistani army in Tayar Manza. The Battle of Wanna ended in a Pakistani victory, but marked the beginning of the War in Northwest Pakistan. A ceasefire was signed in April 2004, but was quickly broken, as fighting in the tribal areas continued throughout 2004. During a Pakistani military operation in September 2004, Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud was put in charge of the local organization and lead the local Talibans against the Pakistani army. Due to Noor Wali's religious education, he was made a qazi (judge) in a Taliban court formed by Baitullah Mehsud. According to locals, Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud famously sentenced Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud to three days in jail. During this period it is also believed Noor Wali served as a deputy to Baitullah Mehsud. Assassination of Benazir Bhutto On December 27, 2007, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in Rawalpindi. Rising through the ranks Flyer distributed by the Pakistani government, announcing bounties on high-level TTP commanders. Noor Wali Mehsud is #6 on the list. Following the assassination of Baitullah Mehsud, Noor Wali operated out of the Gorgoray area in his native South Waziristan. In 2009, he ran a TTP training camp in Gorgoray, as evidenced by the flyers sent out by the Pakistani government that placed bounties on high- level TTP commanders, provided pictures, and described their role in the organization. As of November 2009, Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud had a bounty of 2 million rupees placed on his head.

Because of growing hostilities toward the Jewish community, her family emigrated to Argentina when Cecilia was five years old, and she spent her childhood years in Avellaneda, south of the Buenos Aires suburbs. Her father died within a few years of arriving in their new home and her mother remarried. Cecilia married Mario Berdichevsky, a physician from Avellaneda, in 1951. Despite having a good job as a practicing accountant for ten years, she was not happy there having experienced many frustrations. A friend, computer scientist Rebeca Guber, convinced her to go back to school, which changed her life. === Clementina === At the age of 31, Berdichevsky began her studies of mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires with Manuel Sadosky. There she had her first experience programming the new Ferranti Mercury computer, which became known by the nickname \\"Clementina\\" after someone programmed it to play the American song, \\"My darling Clementine.\\" In 1961, when it arrived in Buenos Aires from England, Clementina was the most powerful computer in the country, cost $300,000 and measured in length. It was the first large computer used for scientific purposes in the country (in that same year, an IBM 1401 was installed in Buenos Aires for business uses). Typical paper tapes showing holes punched to input data to early computers. The newly graduated Berdichevsky studied computing from the visiting English software engineer Cicely Popplewell (famous for having worked with Alan Turing in Manchester) and with the Spanish mathematician Ernesto Garc√≠a Camarero. Popplewell herself motivated Berdichevsky to write and run the first program for the new computer, which required multiple arithmetic calculations. A photoelectric device read a punched paper ribbon that was used to submit the data and Clementina produced the desired result in only seconds. Based on Berdichevsky's progress in Argentina, in 1962 she was one of two people awarded scholarships to continue studies at the University of London's Computer Unit for five months, followed by the same length of time at a French institution. She returned home the following year as an expert on the workings of Clementina. According to Berdichevsky, > \\"Work with Mercury was defined by its resources and its characteristics, > structure and operational capabilities, as well as by the languages, > routines, stored libraries and facilities that it offered... Mercury could > not perform more than one operation at the same time, and they were the > three basic arithmetical operations: addition, subtraction, and > multiplication.\\" The computer's resources included: machine language, an assembler named Pig2; a high-level programming language (a compiler) called Autocode. Later another compiler called Comic replaced Autocode. In those days, compilers were unique and were written only for each computer; they were not developed for use on multiple models of computers until years later.Garcia Camarero, Ernesto (1961). AUTOCODE un sistema simplificado de codificacion para la computadora MERCURY (in Spanish). Universidad de Buenos Aires. p. 70. In addition, Berdichevsky worked as Head of Practical Works of Numerical Calculus I, where the tenured professor was her mentor, Manuel Sadosky who was then vice-dean of the Faculty of Exact Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires from 1957 to 1966. === Coup d'√©tat === Night of the Long Batons, 1966 Berdichevsky worked with Sadosky's institute until an Argentinian coup d'√©tat that installed a military dictatorship, which imposed government control over the workings of the previously autonomous state universities. This intrusion led to student/professor sit-ins that resulted in the violent Night of the Long Batons on 29 July 1966 when military troops physically beat and evicted the academic occupiers from the University of Buenos Aires and other institutions of higher learning. Many academics, including Sadosky, were forced into exile.Morero, Sergio; Ariel Eidelman, Ariel; y Lichtman, Guido. La noche de los bastones largos, 2nd ed. Buenos Aires: Nuevohacer Grupo Editor Latinoamericana, 2002. Collection: Colecci√≥n Temas. . Berdichevsky herself began working as an accountant. Between 1966 and 1970 she was also one of the directors of Scientific Technical Advisors (ACT), the company formed by her former academic associates, Manuel Sadosky, Rebeca Guber and Juan Chamero. === Later years === In 1984, Berdichevsky became Deputy General Manager of the Argentine savings bank Caja de Ahorro in charge of its computer center. She was also named the representative at the International Federation for Information Processing. After her retirement, she continued to work as a computer consultant and participated in important international projects and organizations such as United Nations Development Program.

It is under Ministry of Religious Affairs and Inter-faith Harmony. ==Background== In June 2014, the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the Peshawar church bombing case mandated the federal government to form a national council for minorities. Till 2018 no such Commission was formed. So the Centre for Social Justice, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan and the Cecil and Iris Chaudhry Foundation filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court to have the judgement implemented. On 19 February 2020, the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Inter- faith Harmony requested the Supreme Court to give more time for the formation of the commission and the Court gave 2 months to constitute the commission. ==Structure== The commission contains six official and 12 non-official members including the chairman for a term of three years. The 6 official members are chairman of the Council of Islamic Ideology, secretary of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, one member from the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Law and Justice, the Ministry of Human Rights and the Federal Education and Professional Training each. The 12 non-official members include 2 Muslims, 3 Hindus, 3 Christians, 2 Sikh, 1 Parsi and 1 Kalasha members. ==Criticism== The Ahmadiya were excluded from the Commission. A resolution seeking their inclusion was submitted in the Pakistan assembly in which it is said that the Ahmadiya to be included in the Commission, if their top leaders submits that the Ahmadiyas are non Muslims. The Hindu Sudhar Sabha criticized the commission for excluding Scheduled castes Hindus, who constitute majority of the Hindu community. The Peter Jacob, the Catholic director of the Centre for Social Justice said that the minority commission is under the Ministry of Religious Affairs and have no statutory powers. He added that the formation of the minority commission was supposed to be formes as an act of parliament. Another criticism is about the inclusion of two Muslim members in the a commission for religious minorities.Religious Minority leaders questioned that if non-Muslim cannot be part of the Council of Islamic Ideology, then why include Muslim members in the minority commission? . ==References== Category:Pakistan federal departments and agencies Category:Pakistani commissions and inquiries Category:Pakistani public service commissions ","title":"Pakistan National Commission for Minorities"},{"id":"63941436","text":"Pavel Vladimirovich Serebrovsky (January 30, 1888 ‚Äì February 5, 1942) was a Russian ornithologist, biogeographer, and paleontologist. He worked on faunistics, biogeographical theories and worked at the zoological museum of the USSR Academy of Sciences while also collecting in the Altai and Caucasus regions. A couple of bird subspecies have been named after him. He died of starvation and cold during the Siege of Leningrad. ==Life and work == Pavel was the son of Vladimir Vasilievich Serebrovsky and Anna Feofanovna and was born in the village of Khudoshino, Nizhny Novgorod province. One of 13 siblings his father worked in a church and then as a teacher while his mother took an interest in poetry. All the children sang in the church choir and one sibling Gleb became a talented bass singer. In 1905 Pavel apprenticed to a shoemaker and learned to repair shoes. He graduated from the gymnasium in 1907 and joined Moscow University but after the dismissal of M.A. Menzbier in 1911, all the students moved to Kharkov University and he graduated in 1915. He became involved in ornithological research and collected specimens from 1910 to 1911 in the Nizhny Novogorod region. In 1912 he joined Petr Sushkin's expedition into the Altai and in 1916 he went collecting in the Caucasus. He taught at the Kharkov gymnasium from 1916 to 1918 and married another teacher Maria Nikitchna Karetnikova. He became a faculty at the Kharkov University in 1917 under professor Sushkin. He served in Denikin's Volunteer Army and then returned in 1921. In 1924 he went to work in the museum in the Academy of Sciences at Leningrad on the invitation of Sushkin and after his death Serebrovsky headed the zoological institute for 12 years.

On February 24, his whereabouts were discovered, but during the arrest attempt, Kenyel shot himself in the head. He survived his injuries and was taken to a hospital, where he died four days later due to complications, without regaining consciousness. Although he was never charged with murder as a result of his death, the media coined the nickname The Metro Detroit Serial Killer for Brown, since most of the killings took place in the Detroit metropolitan area. The killings caused a stir both in the city and the entire state after it was found that Brown, a dangerous recidivist, was recruited by law enforcement agencies and worked as a police informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Because of this, between 2017 and 2019, despite committing several offenses and posing a danger to society, he avoided criminal liability under guarantees from employers at the federal agency. == Biography == Kenyel William Brown was born on July 3, 1979 into a large family with several brothers and sisters. He spent his childhood and youth in the city of River Rouge, where he attended the local River Rouge High School. In his school years, Brown, who was physically capable and athletically gifted, became a successful basketball player. Regardless of his potential, he began using narcotic substances in his teens and developed a drug addiction, which caused a drastic change in his personality. He began suffering from poverty, and began leading a criminal lifestyle from an early age. Between 1997 and 2019, Brown was arrested and imprisoned several times. == Criminal career == In August 1997, Kenyel Brown was arrested on charges of attacking a person with a weapon. He was convicted and given a year of imprisonment, which he served at the Wayne County Prison. He was released in 1998, but rearrested the following March for illegal carrying of weapons and resisting arrest. He plead guilty, was conditionally sentenced to 4 years' imprisonment, but in October 1999 was arrested yet again for the illegal possession of a taser and attempting to sell it. After this arrest, he began to cooperate with investigators in a plea agreement, agreeing to plead guilty in exchange for testifying against other inmates, so that the charges against him would be dropped and he could be released. In September 2000, Kenyel was arrested for drug possession and attempting to sell them, but was released yet again after he provided some information on crimes committed in the county. In February 2001, Brown became the cause of an accident during which one person died and another was seriously injured. He tried to flee the crime scene, but was arrested soon after and charged with second-degree murder, resisting arrest, intentionally inflicting moderate injury resulting in death, driving without a license and illegal weapons possession. He was convicted and received 10 years' imprisonment, but was paroled in 2010. In June 2014, Kenyel was arrested in Detroit for illegal possession of weapons. During his detention, he called himself in his dead brother's name and stated that he was suffering from a mental disorder. In March 2015, Brown was recruited by agents of the Bureau for Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, working as an informant for five consecutive years. Based on the provisions of the Armed Career Criminal Act, he was sentenced to life imprisonment, but in June 2015, the Supreme Court recognized some of the law's provisions as unconstitutional, due to which Brown plead guilty and received 21 years' imprisonment, with a trial period of two years. In February 2017, after serving 14 months in prison, he was released, but was rearrested for parole violation in May of that year and returned to prison. Thanks to intervention from the federal agency, however, he was released in July. Over the following years, Kenyel repeatedly violated parole conditions, but each time avoided criminal liability due to his position as an FBI informant. In July 2018, he was arrested for drunk driving in Lincoln Park, later testing positive during a drug test. In January 2019, he was once again arrested for drug intoxication, after which he was ordered to attend a narcologist regularly by the court. He missed four scheduled sessions, after which an arrest warrant was issued on February 22, 2019. Brown was arrested a month later and charged with violating his parole. In May, he was prescribed compulsory treatment for drug addiction, after which he transferred to a drug treatment clinic in Madison Heights, where he spent 21 days and was released on June 12. Two weeks later, he was arrested in Hazel Park for drunk driving, but quickly released on October 29, again as a result of intervention from federal agents. == Murder series == The murders began on December 7, 2019, when Brown shot 31-year-old Lauren Hattington in River Rouge. On January 30, 2020, Brown visited some friends from his youth, 48-year-old Dorian Patterson and his brother Gerald, with whom he drank alcohol. After Gerald left the house and went to work, 52-year-old Kimberly Green and 44-year-old Clifton Smith came by the house. Late in the evening, a quarrel occurred between the pair and Brown, who proceeded to shoot Green and Patterson, as well as non-lethally wounding Smith, who managed to leave the crime scene and report the incident to the police. Based on his testimony and that of Gerald Patterson, Kenyel Brown was put on the wanted list. On February 18, Brown shot and killed 49-year-old Garcius Woodyard in Highland Park while trying to rob him. Two days later, 41-year-old Amir Thaxton was shot dead inside of his clothing store in Detroit, with his money, valuables, and Caravan stolen after. Thaxton was familiar with Kenyel. On the day of the murder, he was recorded visiting him on video surveillance, as well as his car, and on this basis, became a suspect in his murder. Two days after, Brown shot dead 36-year-old Eugene Jennings while trying to steal a car. According to the investigators, he was his last known victim. == Death == On February 24, 2020, Brown was seen visiting an adult bookstore in Oak Park. He was identified by two employees who called the police. Brown was unable to escape in time, as the police soon cordoned off several blocks and began a search operation to detain him. Brown attempted to sneak away by moving through houses, but was spotted by tenants, after which he was surrounded by law enforcement officers in a backyard. While trying to detain him, Brown attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He remained alive for another four days, but due to complications, he died four days later on February 28. == References == Category:1979 births Category:2020 deaths Category:20th-century American criminals Category:21st-century American criminals Category:Male serial killers Category:American serial killers Category:American people convicted of assault Category:American people convicted of drug offenses Category:People convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm Category:Serial killers who committed suicide Category:Deaths by firearm in Michigan Category:Crime in Michigan Category:Murder in Michigan Category:Criminals from Michigan Category:People from River Rouge, Michigan ","title":"Kenyel Brown"},{"id":"63941479","text":"Triple Concerto No. 2, a composer's second triple concerto, may refer to: * Concerto for Three Harpsichords and Orchestra No. 2, BWV 1064, a concerto by Johann Sebastian Bach before c. 1742 * Concertante in D, WoO unv 5, Gardi 3, an unfinished concerto by Ludwig van Beethoven * Triple Concerto No. 2 (Smirnov), a 2003 concerto by Dmitri Smirnov ==See also== * Triple concerto ","title":"Triple Concerto No. 2"},{"id":"63941481","text":"Riverside is a suburb of WhangƒÅrei, in Northland Region, New Zealand.

It was established in 2011 to contain a phylogenetically distinct group of species formerly placed in the genus Malcolmiella. Malmidea comprises more than 50 mostly tropical species that grow on bark, although a few grow on leaves. ==Taxonomy== Both the family Malmideaceae and the genus Malmidea were created in 2011 to accommodate a group of species, formerly placed in genus Malcolmiella (family Pilocarpaceae), that molecular phylogenetics showed to be a distinct lineage and worthy of recognition at the family level. Kalb and colleagues originally placed 37 species in the genus‚Äì5 new species and 32 new combinations. Many additional species have since been transferred to Malmidea from other genera, or described as new. ==Description== The thallus of Malmidea lichens grow on bark (corticolous) or on leaves (foliicolous). The form of the thallus is like a crust, ranging in surface texture from smooth to verrucose (studded with wartlike protuberances), granulose (covered with small grains) or pustulate (covered with pustules). These variously shaped surface bumps are often formed by goniocysts (spherical aggregations of photobiont cells surrounded by short- celled hyphae) that develop on a whitish fibrous underlying prothallus. The photobiont partner of Malmidea is a member of Chlorococcaceae, a family of green algae. Malmidea apothecia are sessile, with a more or less rounded shape, and have a distinct margin. They have a biatorine structure, meaning that they have only a pale, not blackened proper margin and always lack a margin on the thallus. The excipulum is usually paraplectenchymatous (a cell arrangement where the hyphae are oriented in all directions), made of radiating hyphae, partly with medullary layer or chambers composed of loosely arranged, periclinal hyphae (i.e. lined up in parallel adjacent to another layer of hyphae) with constricted septa and incrusted with hydrophobic granules. The hypothecium (the layer of hyphal tissue immediately beneath the hymenium) is prosoplectenchymatous (a cell arrangement where the hyphae are all oriented in one direction), and translucent to dark brown. Asci are club- shaped, lacking a distinct tubular structure in the tholus that is characteristic of family Pilocarpaceae. Ascospores usually number 4 to 8 per ascus, and are colourless, ellipsoid, non-septate, and usually filled with oblong crystals. The spore walls are evenly thickened or thickened at the ends, and halonate (having a transparent outer layer). Conidia are threadlike and curved, measuring 17‚Äì25 by 0.8 Œºm. Secondary chemicals associated with Malmidea include atranorin, sometimes norsolorinic acid (as in M. piperis), anthraquinones, biphenyls and many unknown xantholepinones. ==Species== , Malmidea contains an estimated 52 species, although more are expected to be transferred into the genus from tropical species of Lecidea. Malmidea mostly occurs in tropical rainforests. *Malmidea amazonica (Redinger) Kalb, Rivas Plata & Lumbsch (2011) *Malmidea atlantica (M.C√°ceres & L√ºcking) M.C√°ceres & Kalb (2011) *Malmidea attenboroughii Kukwa & B.Guzow-Krzem.

Union forces under General Alvan C. Gillem attacked Confederate forces under General John C. Vaughn who were defending Morristown, Tennessee. Vaughn's Confederates were routed and Gillem's forces pursued them into nearby Russellville, Tennessee. ==Background== Confederate general John C. Vaughn. Morristown, Tennessee sat at the crossroads of the East Tennessee & Virginia Railroad and the turnpike to Cumberland Gap. This railroad location meant that troops were moving through Morristown as early as Spring 1861. The town would remain a key military crossroads for the rest of the war. At the time, it was a small collection of buildings surrounded by open farm land. Shortly after becoming Abraham Lincoln's running mate for the election of 1864, Andrew Johnson began working on removing Confederate resistance in East Tennessee. Johnson sent Brigadier General Alvan C. Gillem to establish civil law and protect loyal mountaineers. In October 1864, Brigadier General John C. Vaughn's Confederate forces captured the railroad depot at Bull‚Äôs Gap, before taking up position at Morristown. On the morning of October 28, 1864, Gillem moved his Union forces from Newport, Tennessee to Morristown in order to dislodge Vaughn out of East Tennessee and capture his men. ==Battle== Union general Alvan C. Gillem. In preparing his defenses, Vaughn deployed his Confederate forces into two lines. The first line, dismounted, ran west of the town for around a mile long. The second line, also about a mile long, was east of the town and was most likely flanked on both sides with artillery. One section of artillery was stationed where Morristown College (now Heritage Park) used to be. Gillem's Union brigade arrived at the battlefield around 9 o'clock in the morning coming from the west. On his approach to Morristown, he was engaged by about 100 Confederates under the command of Col. James Rose (namesake of Morristown's Rose Center.) They were sent by Vaughn to scout the size of the Union army. This forced Gillem's forces to deploy as Col. Rose returned to Vaughn to report the superior Union force. Upon nearing the first Confederate line, Gillem's artillery deployed itself to the his right flank and opened fire on the Confederate left, whose artillery promptly returned fire. A brigade of Gillem's Union cavalry charged the center and the right of the first Confederate line under fire. There, they slammed into the Rebels and began to push them back. The Confederate left, seeing the charge develop on their right, used dismounted forces from the first line and cavalry from the second line to attack the Union right. Despite initially pushing the Union line back, the Confederates failed to break through. The first line on the Confederate right then collapsed and were chased by Union cavalrymen. The Union cavalry pushed into the town itself, where they were counter charged by mounted Confederates. The Union forces on the right then began moving to get behind the Confederate's far left, south of the town. A Union cavalry charge was launched at points all along the Confederate line and the Rebels buckled under the pressure, with the final line giving way. It is believed that the second line first broke on the far left. Union cavalrymen were already to their rear and moving quickly to cut off any retreat. The Confederates artillery battery was captured east of town. The town itself was capture along with Col. Rose, whose horse was shot down. The Confederates at first tried to have an orderly withdraw, but pressure from the Union forces turned it into a full-blown route towards Russellville, Tennessee. Vaughn even admitted in his official report, \\"I regret to say that my command was stampeded at Morristown this morning.\\" They were heavily pursued by Union forces until the Confederates, freshly reinforced, made a stand at Russellville. The Union forces had successfully pushed Vaughn out of Morristown. ==Aftermath== Vaughn was completely pushed out of Morristown and his men routed. The battle is locally known as \\"Vaughn's Stamped.\\" He would withdraw into northeast Tennessee and be reinforced under the command of former vice president Major General John C. Breckinridge. They would go on the offensive in November and attack Gillem at the Battle of Bull's Gap on the 11th through the 13th. Gillem's forces were routed and the battle became known as \\"Gillem's Stamped.\\" He was forced to abandon Morristown and retreat to Strawberry Plains near Knoxville, Tennessee. ===Casualties=== About 18 Union soldiers were wounded, and 8 killed. The Confederates lost around 85 killed and 224 wounded or captured. ==Battlefield== Bethesda Presbyterian Church was a hospital during operations around Morristown. There is little mention of the battle in current-day Morristown. Most of what was the battlefield is now developed land. The only remnants of the battle is Bethesda Presbyterian Church, which was a hospital used during the operations, and numerous graveyards in Hamblen County. At Bethesda Presbyterian Church and Emma Jarnagin Cemetery, there are memorials for unknown Confederate dead, many of whom gave their lives in the skirmishes around Morristown. ==Notes== ==References== Morristown Morristown Morristown Category:Hamblen County, Tennessee Category:Conflicts in 1864 Category:1864 in Tennessee Category:October 1864 events Category:Morristown, Tennessee ","title":"Battle of Morristown"},{"id":"63941639","text":"Kr√¥ng NƒÉng may refer to several places in Vietnam, including: *Kr√¥ng NƒÉng District, a rural district of ƒê·∫Øk L·∫Øk Province *Kr√¥ng NƒÉng, ƒê·∫Øk L·∫Øk, a township and capital of Kr√¥ng NƒÉng District *, a rural commune of Kr√¥ng Pa District ","title":"Kr√¥ng NƒÉng"},{"id":"63941642","text":"The GAZ-55 () was a Soviet military ambulance developed in 1943 by Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod (GAZ) and was used by the USSR during the Second World War.

Songs of his heroic exploits were was sung by the famous guslar Filip Vi≈°njiƒá in the song \\"Battle of Loznica\\". Today one of the primary schools in Loznica bears his name. ==First Serbian Uprising== Antonije Bogiƒáeviƒá, though born in Serbia, his ancestors came from Bosnia. During the First Serbian Uprising, he joined the insurgents and worked in organizing the government and supplying the army. He was appointed duke in 1807 of Jadar defending this troubled area from Turkish incursions from Bosnia and Herzegovina. He fought the Turks in Krupanj, Rozaje, Raƒëevo Polje, and most often in Loznica, where several bloody battles were fought with the Bosnian Turkish army. He was wounded in one of those fights. The most significant was the battle for Loznica, fought on the 5 and 6 October 1810, according to the old calendar. Under Ali Pasha Vidajiƒá, 30,000 Turks descended along the Drina in riverboats called ≈°ajkato the Tiƒçar field near Loznica. The fortified city wall was defended by 1,200 Serbs, led by the Duke of Loznica, Antonije \\"Anta\\" Bogiƒáeviƒá. The siege lasted twelve days. Assessing that he could not resist the Turkish attacks, Duke Anta turned to Luka Lazareviƒá for help. According to the report on the siege of Loznica, and after Karaƒëorƒëe dislodged Hashid Pasha from Morava, he hurried to help with almost the entire army from ≈†umadija and 200 Cossacks. It seems that Karaƒëorƒëe estimated that the most decisive battle in 1810 would ultimately take place right there. The importance of Karaƒëorƒëe attached to the battle is also shown by the letter sent to Petar Dobrnjac asking him for reinforcements: \\"Don't hesitate for a minute. Every minute is worth it, I really care if the army arrives on the Drina a minute earlier.\\" Luka Lazareviƒá and Jakov Nenadoviƒá came to the rescue with the army of the ≈†abac and Valjevo districts. The decisive battle began on the morning of 6 October 1810. Karaƒëorƒëe later informed Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá about this: \\"Both the Turks and we went out into the field, and a bloody fight ensued with cannons and rifles ablaze that after eight hours there was no greater than this battle.\\" This victory of the Serbian army is one of the most significant in the First Serbian Uprising. When Duke Anta Bogiƒáeviƒá died in 1813, his son Bogosav Bogiƒáeviƒá was appointed duke. He was buried in Loznica on the trench, but the Turks took out his body, cut off his head and threw his body into the river ≈†tira. However, patriots later secretly removed his bones and buried him next to the church in Loznica. His daughter Tomanija married Jevrem Obrenoviƒá, and his son Milo≈° was killed by Toma Vuƒçiƒá Peri≈°iƒá when he quelled the Katan rebellion in 1844. The grandson of Tomanija and Jevrem Obrenoviƒá became the first king of modern Serbia, Milan Obrenoviƒá IV. ==Legacy== There is a public school in Serbia named after him. ==See also== * List of Serbian Revolutionaries == References == * Translated and adapted from Serbian Wikipedia: –ê–Ω—Ç–∞ –ë–æ–≥–∏—õ–µ–≤–∏—õ Category:1758 births Category:1813 deaths Category:People from Loznica Category:People of the Second Serbian Uprising Category:Serbian military leaders Category:Serbian revolutionaries Category:19th-century Serbian people ","title":"Anta Bogiƒáeviƒá"},{"id":"63941732","text":"Transition Korea () is an anti-establishment political party in South Korea.

It is bounded to the north by Kibalabag; to the east by Caburacanan, Mapulo, Silae, and Barangay Freedom of Cabanglasan; to the south by Miglamin, Linabo, and San Jose; and to the west by Casisang, the Poblacion District, and Sumpong. Can-ayan is characterized by a mountainous terrain and steep hills with intermittent flatland and valleys formed by the Tagoloan, Malas, Tigbawan, and Taguican Rivers. Most of the land is classified as forestland, at around 10,189 hectares; the remaining land is alienable and disposable. The barangay is subdivided into five purok in the village proper and nine sitio scattered throughout its territory. These are: * Can-ayan Proper * Candiisan * Incalbog * Kiito * Kilap-agan * Tagalolo * Tag-ilanao * Taguican * Tigbawan * Tintinaan ==Economy== Agriculture and forestry are the major economic activities of Can-ayan. There are several livestock farms operating in the barangay. Among the chief products include corn, rice, vegetables, and mushrooms. Can-ayan connects the Upper Pulangi District to the city proper through a secondary road traversing the barangay, offering an alternative route to the Aglayan-Zamboanguita Road. ==Education== There are several public elementary schools in the area and one high school, all of which are under the administration of the Department of Education Division of Malaybalay City, Schools Division II * Can-ayan Integrated School * Candiisan Elementary School * Incalbog Elementary School * Kilap-agan Elementary School * Tag-ilanao Elementary School * Tintinaan Elementary School ==History== Can-ayan was first settled by Higaonon people; under Spanish rule, the village was incorporated into the pueblo of Oroquita del Interior. Its first recorded teniente del barrio was Dat√π Ampelino Lito. The area served as a route to Silae, where Dominican and Jesuit missionaries established their communities there. Can- ayan maintained its organization even during the American and Japanese occupation of the country. After World War II, both the national and local governments gradually provided basic services to the village up to the present. With its growing population and the sprawl of urbanization from the city proper, Can-ayan is a prospective area for development. == References == Category:Barangays of Bukidnon Category:Barangays of Malaybalay ","title":"Can-ayan"},{"id":"63941896","text":"Ricardo Dillon (born 4 August 1964 in Argentina) is an Argentinean football manager who now works as head coach of Mushuc Runa S.C. in Ecuador.se confirma a ricardo dillon como nuevo dt de mushuc runa INFOCancha Informaci√≥n Deportiva == Career == Dillon started his managerial career with Independiente Rivadavia.

His residence alternated between Paris, Berlin, D√ºsseldorf and Munich. In 1890, he decided to settle in Vienna and opened a studio in the Wieden district. In 1900, together with and Heinrich Lefler, he opened an \\"Art School for Ladies\\". He continued to visit Paris frequently and, when he painted there, signed his works with the pseudonym \\"A.

Why he did this is unclear, although his choice of signature often reflects stylistic differences. His landscapes were influenced by the Barbizon school and the style known as \\"paysage intime\\", both of which he was exposed to in France during the 1870s. He was a frequent exhibitor and won numerous awards; notably at the Exposition Universelle (1900). From 1890 to 1913, he was a member of the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts; representing them at exhibitions at the Glaspalast in Munich and the . He became a full member of the Vienna K√ºnstlerhaus in 1909. His travels continued until they were cut short by the beginning of World War I.

The fake punt, attempted in a regular-season game against the New England Patriots, failed in spectacular fashion, and resulted in a tackle for loss, penalty, and harsh criticism of the players and coaches involved. ==Background== The Colts and Patriots were perennial playoff contenders who had developed an intense rivalry over the years. The Patriots had most recently blown out the Colts in the 2014 AFC Championship Game (before subsequently winning Super Bowl XLIX), in a game marked by the Deflategate scandal. This Week 6 Sunday Night Football game was the first meeting between the two teams since the scandal. The game featured a back-and-forth first half in which Patriots quarterback Tom Brady threw one touchdown pass and Colts quarterback Andrew Luck threw two. With strong running games and accurate kickers on each side, the Colts led the close contest by only a single point at halftime, 21‚Äì20. After Brady threw a touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski on the Patriots' first drive of the third quarter, the teams traded punts for several possessions. When a Colts possession stalled at their own 37 yard line, the team chose to call for a trick play. ==The play== With 1:14 remaining in the third quarter, facing a 4th down and 3 yards to go on their own 37 yard line, the Colts lined up in a punt formation, with punter Pat McAfee in his usual position. After several moments, most of the Colts' punt team began jogging toward the Indianapolis sideline, but stopped and lined up in an imitation of their punt formation near the outer hash mark. Upback Colt Anderson jogged with them, then ran back toward the ball and lined up as quarterback behind gunner Griff Whalen, who had positioned himself as the new center and was prepared to snap the ball. The Patriots players initially followed the Colts toward their sideline, but some remained in the area near the ball. Brandon Bolden and Jon Bostic positioned themselves on either side of Whalen in what would normally be called the A-gaps. Whalen snapped the ball with one second remaining on the play clock, and Bolden was immediately on top of Anderson, wrestling him to the ground with the assistance of Tarell Brown. A penalty flag was thrown on the play, which referee Tony Corrente announced as an illegal formation penalty: \\"The whole right side of the line was not on the line of scrimmage,\\" he explained. New England coach Bill Belichick declined the penalty, accepting the Colts' yardage loss and setting up his Patriots with a 1st and 10 at the Indianapolis 35 yard line. New England scored a touchdown on the ensuing drive and went on to win the game 34‚Äì27. ==Reaction== Color commentator Cris Collinsworth cut himself off in mid-thought when the Colts began moving. He and play-by-play announcer Al Michaels reacted to the play with hesitation and confusion. A nonplussed Collinsworth spent several moments trying to analyze the play, making statements such as, \\"That was insane,\\" \\"I've never seen anything more bizarre than that,\\" and \\"What was the plan?\\" to which Michaels replied \\"I don't know. It's completely nuts.\\" Scott Allen of The Washington Post immediately compared the play to former Washington Redskins coach Jim Zorn's similarly infamous \\"swinging gate\\" play in . ==McAfee's explanation== Punter McAfee provided a detailed explanation of the play on the October 18, 2019 edition of The Pat McAfee Show‚Äîthe fourth anniversary of the play. According to McAfee, the play was designed to trick the Patriots into committing either of two penalties. In the first scenario, the Patriots would be fooled into thinking the Colts' offense was about to enter the field and attempt to send in defensive players, creating a situation in which the Colts could catch them with too many men on the field. In the second scenario, if the Patriots did not commit a substitution violation, Anderson was to use a hard count to try to draw them offside. Either scenario would give the Colts enough penalty yardage for a first down; but if neither occurred, the Colts would simply wait for the play clock to expire and accept a delay of game penalty, then punt normally on the next play. McAfee claimed that the play was executed flawlessly during practice, but that Whalen was not involved in the practice drills. The player who had initially been assigned the role of snapper, McAfee said, was deactivated on Saturday due to illness, leaving Whalen only a day or so to learn the play; as a result, Whalen was unaware of several verbal and physical prompts that had been added in the meantime. Per McAfee, Whalen should not have snapped the ball at all during the play. Similarly, Pagano attributed a \\"communications breakdown\\" for the play's failure. ==Legacy== The Colts finished the year 8‚Äì8, one game behind the AFC South champion Houston Texans, beginning a 3-year playoff drought. Coach Chuck Pagano was fired in 2017 after two subsequent non-winning seasons. Football fans on Twitter reacted with strong statements of contempt directed toward the Colts. Internet memes that spread in the immediate aftermath featured Luck, Pagano, and other Colts figures cast as the Three Stooges, along with Hillary Clinton and other controversial political characters. The NFL Network produced an episode of their \\"Top 10\\" series related to the worst plays in NFL history, and ranked the Colts Catastrophe number six, behind such plays as the Butt Fumble, the Wrong Way Run, and the Miracle at the Meadowlands. ==See also== *Colts‚ÄìPatriots rivalry *Deflategate ==References== Category:American football plays Category:Indianapolis Colts Category:New England Patriots Category:American football incidents Category:2015 in sports in Indiana ","title":"Colts Catastrophe"},{"id":"63942050","text":"thumb Dezs≈ë Jakab (4 November 1864 ‚Äì 5 August 1932) was a Hungarian architect of Jewish heritage. == Life == He received his degree in architecture from the Budapest University of Technology.

The lake is situated 13 km north of the town of Murupara, and about 16 km upstream of the Matahina Dam. The lake was created as a result of the construction of a 10 m high dam, part of the Aniwhenua hydroelectric scheme. ==Description== Lake ƒÄniwaniwa is a long, shallow lake that measures 4.5 km long and 0.5 km across, with total area of about 2.1 km2. The Whakatane District Council manages a campground on the northeastern lakeside, near the dam. ==History== A series of feasibility studies and investigations into establishing a hydroelectric scheme upstream from the Matahina Dam were performed throughout the 1970s. Construction on the scheme occurred between 1977 and 1981, and included the creation of a 10 m dam, which would hold back the newly formed Lake ƒÄniwaniwa. The original name of the lake was Lake Aniwhenua, which was erroneously taken from the name of the nearby ƒÄniwaniwa falls. Under the NgƒÅti Manawa Claims Settlement Act 2012, Lake ƒÄniwaniwa became the official name of the name. ==WildlifeFish=== Mature longfin and shortfin eels both migrate down the Rangitaiki River each autumn, following their upstream migration as elvers (juveniles). The construction of the dam at Lake ƒÄniwaniwa, along with the Matahina dam downstream, have impeded this migratory pathway. Since the creation of the dam, numerous studies exploring strategies to mitigate the impact of the Lake ƒÄniwaniwa dam on the migration of Rangitaiki have been conducted, often supported by the operators of the Aniwhenua hydroelectric scheme. The Department of Internal Affairs initiated a programme in 1983 to manually translocate elvers upstream, work later continued by the Department of Conservation and the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand. In 1995, the number of elvers being translocated annually to Lake ƒÄniwaniwa reached 149,000. Some locals have taken it upon themselves to manually transfer elvers and mature eels to and from Lake ƒÄniwaniwa. Lake ƒÄniwaniwa additionally contains both rainbow and brown trout, as well as mosquitofish, common bully and goldfish. ===Birdlife=== Lake ƒÄniwaniwa is home to various species of native waterbirds, including the New Zealand shoveler, New Zealand scaup and Australian coot. Surveys conducted at the lake in the 1980s (around four years after the completion of the dam) also indicated the presence of other species such as the marsh crake, spotless crake, New Zealand dabchick and the threatened Australasian bittern. ===Hunting and fishing=== Both trout fishing and game bird hunting (during the annual hunting season) are permitted at Lake ƒÄniwaniwa. In 2003, some controversy arose when the Fish & Game Council opened the north end of the lake to hunting. Some were concerned that it posed a safety risk given the proximity to the campground; however, Fish & Game argued that hunters had a responsibility to be cautious near public areas. ==References== Category:Lakes of the Bay of Plenty Region Category:Reservoirs in New Zealand ","title":"Lake ƒÄniwaniwa"},{"id":"63942059","text":"The Pretend One is an Australian independent realism drama film directed by Tony Prescott.

The logo he designed became an internationally known trademark for complete device systems for image-synchronous sound recording and processing in film and television studios since the 1950s. == History of MWA  Early years === Initially, the company developed and produced kits for radio receivers and supplied them to end users, subsequently ‚Äì in advanced versions - to industrial radio manufacturers such as Blaupunkt. Workshop in Berlin-Tempelhof In 1936, the company moved to larger premises at Juliusstrasse in Berlin's Neuk√∂lln district. In the following years, development and manufacturing concentrated on equipment for communication technology. In 1944, the factory was partially damaged by a bomb attack. === The first post-war years === In the remaining workshops and with the inventory of materials and machinery saved after the end of the war, items for everyday‚Äôs use at that time were manufactured (e. g. tobacco cutting machines). In addition, repairs of damaged industrial equipment were carried out. === Entry into film sound engineering === In this context, Albrecht came into contact with remaining companies of the Berlin film industry. As early as 1946, MWA received an order from Berlin-based Kaudel-Film to design and manufacture an optical sound camera (LTK 1) and other devices for sound recording and processing of feature films in sync with the picture. In addition, the company developed and manufactured stationary and portable sound mixing consoles for film studios. LTK 1 (1946) - optical sound camera with closed film reels However, Albrecht soon realized that the future of film sound recording and processing would not be the optical sound technology that had been used until then, but the magnetic sound process, which had already been experimented with in the USA. He developed the first magnetic film sound device in Europe, the so-called magnetic sound camera (MTK 1). === Development from 1950 === MTK 1 (1950) - magnetic sound camera At the beginning of 1950, MWA delivered the MTK 1 to the UFA studios in Berlin- Tempelhof where it was used for dubbing feature films and for sound recording of new productions until 1970. After a public presentation of the MTK 1, the UFA praised it as a ‚Äúmasterpiece of modern film equipment construction, and also in a new area of sound film technology‚Äù (see letter from the UfA dated April 4, 1950). [1] In terms of technology, this was already the breakthrough, but an unrestricted delivery to film studios all over the world could only take place after a protracted patent dispute had ended. Numerous further developments followed, from the MTK 1 to the MR 10 travel model, also supplemented by the KT 2 camera table as well as e. g. amplifiers and sound deleting devices (de-magnetizers). The column-shaped magnetic film recorders/reproducers were a major adaptation to the needs in studios - starting in 1950 with the MB 1, followed by numerous successor models up to the MB 51, which were used in film and television studios worldwide for decades. MWA advertisement In parallel to the constant further development of devices using magnetic sound technology - later also for the new medium of television - Albrecht even participated in significant constructions for phonograph technology . Thank-you letter from UfA 1950 In 1956, the company was transformed into a GmbH (in English: Ltd.). Wilhelm Albrecht and his wife Helene, who had headed the commercial division since 1945, were appointed managing directors with sole authorization, engineer G√ºnter Kie√ü was appointed Technical Manager. The latter held this position until 1991. He extensively documented MWA equipment and systems. [2] In 1961, the company moved to larger premises on Maybachufer in Berlin-Neuk√∂lln. After the death of the company‚Äôs founder in 1962, his widow Helene Albrecht became general manager, a position which she held until 1974. The continuous and innovative further development of the sound devices, which were soon supplemented by picture film transports and film scanners as well as complementary control systems was groundbreaking for the changing sophisticated production processes in film and television studios and consolidated the company's position on the international market. In 1974, Margret Albrecht, daughter of Wilhelm and Helene Albrecht, took over the general management of the company. MB 43, 1978, DB Studio, England After expanding the development capacities ‚Äì due to its significance supported by state funding for research and development - and enlarging the production premises, as well as optimizing the operational procedures and creating additional sales channels, the production and delivery capacities were doubled within six years. In 1980, Wilhelm Albrecht GmbH was included in the ADAC travel guide listing technical places of interest in Germany. [3] === History from the 80s === In 1984, Helene Kunow-Albrecht and Margret Nilsson-Albrecht sold their shares to Berliner Elektro Beteiligungen, which enabled the successful flotation as Berliner Elektro Holding AG (stock company). Studio Hamburg, 1986 Soon it became evident that digital technology would also largely replace the conventional analogue magnetic sound process. As a result, under the control of engineer Peter Stroetzel (general manager since 1990), the laser optical sound camera (LLK 3) for the production of optical sound negatives was developed, manufactured and, from 1996, sold to film studios and film laboratories all around the world. However, after the traditional medium film with added optical sound track was replaced by digital video technology, this market soon became saturated.

Then it has to be fried in oil, then set aside again, and the process repeated. It has to be stored in an air-tight container.

He was killed by Usta≈°e of the Nazi Germany-aligned Independent State of Croatia in August 1941. The Serbian Orthodox Church venerates him as a Saint. ==Life== He was born Svetozar Trlajiƒá to Stevan and Jelisaveta (n√©e Karaka≈°eviƒá) in Mol on 18 July 1884. His education included the primary school in his hometown, a grammar school in Novi Sad, and seminary in Sremski Karlovci.

On June 8, the notorious executioner Josip Tomljenoviƒá ordered all diocesan money and records to be handed over to the Ustashi. Bp. Sava refused the Ustashi order to leave his diocese and go to Belgrade. Not wanting to abandon his flock, he refused. Bishop Sava was arrested on June 17, 1941, and confined, together with three other Serbian priests and thirteen eminent Serbian laymen, in a stable owned by Josip Tomljenoviƒá in Pla≈°ki. After experiencing intense torture, Bishop Sava and the priests, Bogoljub Gakoviƒá, ƒêuro Stojanoviƒá, and Stanislav Nasadilo, were chained and taken to the Gospiƒá concentration camp on 19 July 1941. There, they were tortured until mid-August. At that time Bishop Sava was taken together with 2,000 Serbs toward the Velebit Mountains.

Her doctoral thesis was dedicated to the embryology of the viviparous freshwater fish, Fitzroyia lineata (now under Jenynsia, Characiformes: Jenyns√ºdae). She worked as a head of the Laboratory until 1924 and as a substitute professor from 1933 to 1946, returning to this position in 1955. Her university activity was interrupted due to the unstable political situation in Argentina. She participated in some investigational trips, such as to Puerto Madryn in 1916 and to Santa Cruz in 1936 with her husband Max Birab√©n. Mar√≠a Isabel Hylton Scott's thesis In 1954, Hylton Scott and her husband founded the scientific magazine \\"Neotropica - Notas Zoologicas Americanas\\", which they kept editing until 1976. Until now Neotropica is indexed in Malacological Review. She retired at the age of 76 in 1965 and accompanied her husband to Buenos Aires, where he was designated Director of the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales. She continued her scientific studies in the field of zoology, publishing five new works from 1977 to 1984. In 1977, at the age of 88, she received an honorable medal on the 100th anniversary of the Museo de La Plata. The same year she was named an Honorary Member of the Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Ciencias Naturales. At the age of 100, Hylton Scott donated her personal collection of mollusks to the Museo de La Plata. Maria Isabel Hylton Scott died on 1 September 1990 in La Plata. She was posthumously designated Honorary President of the 1st Latin American Congress on Malacology in Caracas in 1991. == List of described specimens == Mollusca Genera * Cochleornata 1975 * Hirtudiscus 1973 * Kuschelenia 1951 * Paracochlea 1967 * Pilsbrylia 1952 * Stephadiscus 1981 * Ulpia 1955 == List of publications (selection) == * HYLTON SCOTT, M.I. 1918.

The ecoregion is located on several volcanic and non-volcanic mountains of the island. Luzon is the largest and northernmost major island of the Philippines, located in the western Pacific Ocean.\\"Luzon montane rain forests\\". World Wildlife Fund. Satellite view of the island Luzon ==Geography== The ecoregion includes several volcanic and non- volcanic mountains that exceed in altitude. The volcanic mountains include Mt. Makiling, Mt. Banahaw, Mt. Isarog, Mayon Volcano, and Bulusan Volcano. Also within the ecoregion are the Northern and Southern Sierra Madre, Mt. Sapacoy, Mt. Magnas, and Mt. Agnamala in the northern Cordillera Central highlands and the Zambales Mountains in the west. The Sierra Madre mountain range. Luzon has never been connected to mainland Asia. Even when glacial advances during the Pleistocene caused sea levels to fall over 100 meters worldwide, this only connected Luzon to the modern islands of Polillo, Marinduque, and Catanduanes. At least 15 million years ago, friction between the Australian and Asian tectonic plates and volcanic activity created parts of the Luzon highlands, which over the next 10 million years morphed into their modern form. This long period of isolation and complex internal geography is a primary cause for the great biodiversity and high degree of endemism found on the island of Luzon. ==Climate== In some areas, annual rainfall can be about quadruple what the lowland rainforests receive (as high as 10,000 mm).McGinley, Mark. \\"Luzon Montane Rain Forests\\". The Encyclopedia of Earth. World Wildlife Fund, 30 May 2007. 24 May 2013. The Sierra Madres have very mild seasons, with a slight dry period between December and April. The Zambales Mountains and northern Central Cordillera highlands are more strongly seasonal with a longer dry period and slightly less rainfall generally. Batong Buhay jeep on its 5-hour once a day journey through the Cordillera Central to Tabuk, the capital of Kalinga province. ==Flora== The dipterocarp trees of the lowlands are gradually replaced by oak and laurel forest species with increasing altitude. The forests generally have less undergrowth and become shorter in stature as altitude increases. With the decreasing temperature from increasing altitude, decomposition is slowed and results in a forest floor thick with humus. In the montane forests, epiphytes, vines, and moss-covered branches are very common. The highest altitudes of montane forests are caller upper montane forest, or elfin forest, and are more extreme: trees are shorter in stature, and tree branches are so thick with moss and organic material that they can sustain aerial plants that are not typically epiphytes. Many endemic animal species reside in the thick, matty soil of the upper montane forests. In fact, species richness is greatest along the highest elevations of the montane rainforests of Luzon. Areas with the greatest levels of endemism are reported to be the Cordillera Central highlands, the Sierra Madre, the Zambales Mountains, and highlands on the Bicol Peninsula. ==Fauna== There are at least 31 endemic species of mammals on the island of Luzon. Sixty-eight percent of all known native non-flying mammals are endemic to the area (23 of 34). The Philippine eagle The Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) is the second-largest eagle in the world found primarily in the Sierra Madre mountain range of Luzon.\\"Philippines\\". Conservation International (24 May 2013) Primary lowland rainforests of the Philippines have been heavily deforested, and the Philippine eagle needs this area to breed, as well as nesting in large trees and hunting within the trees. The eagle is restricted to the islands of Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao. Attempts for captive breeding have been unsuccessful and it is estimated that less than 700 individuals remain. Often called Myer's snake in honor of Dr. George S. Myers, the genus Myersophis represented only by the species alpestris is a snake found only in the northern highlands of Luzon. Opening in jungle canopy at Mount Makiling About sixty-eight percent of all native reptiles are endemic to the area (about 160 of 235). The Philippine crocodile, Crocodylus mindorensis, is a freshwater crocodile that is considered the most threatened crocodile in the world and is endemic to the area; it is only found in Mindanao, Negros, and Luzon. Wild populations in 1982 totaled somewhere between 500 and 1000 individuals. In 1995, this number decreased to a mere 100 individuals. The discovery of a population of this crocodile in the Northern Sierra Madre on Luzon gives hope for its conservation. Active in the conservation of Crocodylus mindorensis is the Crocodile Rehabilitation Observance and Conservation (CROC) Project of the Mabuwaya Foundation. ==Conservation== A 2017 assessment found that 3,813 km¬≤, or 46%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas.Eric Dinerstein, David Olson, et al.

On 15 August he shot down two planes and damaged two more; the next day he claimed one more shot down and another damaged, and did the same on 18 August. In the space of three weeks he was credited with seven kills and four probables, a feat that saw him receive the Distinguished Flying Medal in October 1940.

He is a student of Robert Spaemann, and was his assistant from 1985 to 1992 at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he completed graduate and postgraduate studies in philosophy, Catholic theology, political science and law. His master‚Äôs thesis on Wittgenstein‚Äôs concept of philosophy was published in 1983 (since translated in Italian), his doctoral dissertation, Die √úberwindung der Metaphysik (‚ÄúThe Overcoming of Metaphysics‚Äù) in 1987 (since translated into Japanese and French), and his habilitation thesis Geistesmacht und Menschenrecht (‚ÄúIntellectual Power and Human Rights‚Äù) in 1994. Schweidler has lectured extensively abroad in the English-speaking world, with visiting professorships and research stays at the University of Minnesota, Macquarie University, the University of California at Berkeley (Graduate Theological Union), Manoa University in Honolulu and Loyola Marymount University. == Work == In his dissertation supervised by Robert Spaemann, Die √úberwindung der Metaphysik, Schweidler deals with the distinction between metaphysical and philosophical thinking. In four paradigmatic investigations of the metaphysical critiques of Rudolf Carnap, Oswald Spengler, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Martin Heidegger, he elaborates the characteristics of what he refers to as philosophical ‚Äúintellectual power‚Äù. Issuing from his lecturing activity in the area of practical, particularly political philosophy, his book Der gute Staat (‚ÄúThe Good State‚Äù) was published in 2002. A book similarly directed toward practical philosophical concerns, √úber Menschenw√ºrde (‚ÄúOn Human Dignity‚Äù), was published in 2012. A further common denominator in Schweidler‚Äôs work is the topic of time, in respect to which a systematic collection of his individual works in this area, made over several decades, was published as Das Uneinholbare (‚ÄúThe Uncatchable‚Äù) in 2008.

He was an early settler of Janesville, Wisconsin, and served in the Legislature of the Wisconsin Territory. He was Speaker of the Assembly during the Special Session of the 1st Legislature. ==Biography== Born in Red Hook, Dutchess County, New York. He married Ann Bonesteel, of Woodstock, New York, and they lived for a time in Delhi, New York, where their children were born. Sheldon was associated with the New York Militia and rose to Brigadier General for the 25th Infantry Brigade, 6th Division, in 1836. In 1836, Sheldon moved west with his family, settling in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Territory. There, he was elected as one Milwaukee's representatives to the 1st Legislative Assembly of the Wisconsin Territory. He served in all three sessions of the 1st Assembly, and was chosen as Speaker for the Special session in the summer of 1838. In 1839, Sheldon moved his family to Janesville, in Rock County, where he was one of the first settlers. That year, he was appointed Justice of the Peace for Rock County by Governor Henry Dodge, and remained in that office until 1842. He was also appointed, in 1840, a commissioner to locate suitable land for a university in the Milwaukee region. And, in 1842, he was listed as Commissary General of the Wisconsin Militia.

Bullins is an American NASCAR crew chief who currently works for Team Penske as the crew chief for Brad Keselowski in the No. 2 Ford in the NASCAR Cup Series. He has worked for Penske since 2012. During his time there, he is most notable for being the crew chief for Ryan Blaney from 2015 to 2019 in the Cup Series, both with the No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing team and on Penske's No. 12 car. ==Career== ===1999‚Äì2011: Pre-Penske years=== After graduating college, Bullins began his career in NASCAR with Wood Brothers Racing in October 1999, whose No. 21 car was driven at the time by Elliott Sadler. After his time with the Wood Brothers, he would work in the Busch Series (later Nationwide) for ST Motorsports, which is now JTG Daugherty Racing. He would later leave that team for Robert Yates Racing. Before the 2005 season, Bullins joined Richard Childress Racing. During his time there, he worked as the engineer for Kevin Harvick and Clint Bowyer, and with those two drivers, he racked up a total of nine wins. ===2012‚Äì2014: Penske NNS No. 22=== Bullins was hired in December 2011 by Penske Racing to crew chief the No. 22 team in the Nationwide Series beginning in 2012. He replaced Todd Gordon, who was promoted to crew chief Penske's No. 22 team in the Cup Series after Steve Addington left for Stewart-Haas Racing to be defending series champion Tony Stewart's crew chief that year. In his first year as crew chief for that team, he worked with Brad Keselowski, Parker Kligerman and Jacques Villeneuve. Kligerman would be released and replaced by Ryan Blaney for the rest of his part-time schedule in the car during the season. He earned three wins that season with Keselowski and came close to winning with the other two drivers as well, as Blaney finished second at Texas in November and Villeneuve finished third at Montreal after running out of fuel on the last lap and losing the lead he had held for most of the race. The team finished the year sixth in owner points. For 2013, the team saw a notable uptick in performance. Bullins won at least one race with all four drivers of the No. 22 car that year. Keselowski scored six wins (up from three in 2012), and Blaney would earn his first win in the series at Kentucky in September. Also, Joey Logano, Penske's new full-time Cup Series driver, also ran 14 races in the No. 22 car (Keselowski and Blaney each reduced their schedules by a few races to make room for Logano to drive the car as well). Logano came to Penske from Joe Gibbs Racing at the start of the year, and he was instrumental in leading JGR's No. 18 car to the 2012 NNS owner's championship. A. J. Allmendinger replaced Villeneuve as the No. 22's driver for the standalone road course races of Road America and Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course (which replaced Montreal on the schedule), and would win both of them in dominating fashion. Logano would pick up three wins, which came at both Dover races plus Chicago in July. All of this success resulted in the team winning the 2013 owner's championship. ===2015‚Äì2019: Ryan Blaney=== Bullins returned to the Wood Brothers team in 2015. Now only a part-time team, the No. 21 car was driven by Blaney starting that year, replacing Trevor Bayne, who moved to Roush Fenway Racing to replace the departing Carl Edwards as a full-time driver on that team. WBR also switched from a Roush alliance to a Penske alliance starting in 2015, which is why Bullins was able to work for the team as he was still part of the Penske family. He had previously made his Cup Series crew chiefing debut on Penske's part time No. 12 car when Blaney drove it in his first two Cup races at Kansas and Talladega. ===2020‚Äìpresent: Brad Keselowski=== Despite even having a solid 2019 season, Penske announced a crew chief shakeup for the 2020 season in an effort to be more competitive and dominant like the successes Joe Gibbs Racing was having. During Bullins' time with the No. 12 of Ryan Blaney, the car was arguably the weakest in the Penske stable both years, and he was reassigned to Brad Keselowski's No. 2 team, replacing Paul Wolfe, who moved to Joey Logano's No. 22. Todd Gordon, who had been Logano's crew chief and was very much successful in that role, replaced Bullins as Blaney's crew chief on the No. 12. The duo started the year off on a good note, and Keselowski led 30 laps in the Daytona 500 and 82 at Phoenix three races later. After the first four races, the season was halted for two months due to the coronavirus pandemic. ==Personal life== Bullins is a 1995 graduate of South Stokes High School and then attended North Carolina State University, graduating in 1999 with a mechanical engineering degree.

His mother passed away very early. From 1787 Arnold attended high school in Strasbourg. Due to the French Revolution, the family became impoverished and from 1795 he hired himself as a clerk in the war bureau of the Bas-Rhin department. After the turmoil of the revolution, Braun, Herrnschneider, Johann Schweigh√§user, the lawyer Christoph Wilhelm von Koch, the pedagogue Johann Friedrich Oberlin and the theologians Jean Laurent Blessig and Isaak Haffner established the Protestant Academy in Strasbourg, a kind of free university at which no school fees were paid by the students was raised. In 1798, a year after his father's death, Arnold attended this private college. From 1801 to 1803 Arnold studied law and history at the University of G√∂ttingen. During this time a study trip to Berlin, Hamburg, and Dresden also took place. On the return trip to Strasbourg he visited Friedrich Schiller in Jena and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in Weimar. After only a short stay in Strasbourg, he traveled on to Paris. There he visited his former teacher, Koch, who had meanwhile become a member of the tribunal. Arnold was hoping for a professorship from him at one of the newly established universities. Since Koch could not help him, Arnold started disappointed in June 1804 on a tour of Italy via Geneva, Milan, Genoa, and Florence to Rome, on to Naples, Venice, Turin and back to Paris. In April 1806 Arnold became professor of civil law at the University of Koblenz by imperial decree (professor of the civil code at the Koblenz School of Law). In 1809, the Koblenz Prefect Adrien de Lezay-Marn√©sia got Arnold a call to the University of Strasbourg. First Arnold got a chair for history, in 1811 he finally became professor for Roman law. In 1818 Arnold made a trip to Great Britain. In 1820 he was elected to the office of a prefecture council and at the same time to the board of directors of the Church of Augsburg Confession of France. In 1823 Arnold married the daughter of a landowner from Rappoltsweiler (Ribeauvill√©) in Upper Alsace. He had a daughter with her. On 18 February 1829, on his birthday, J.G.D.

Mack, 'Note on the Genesis of the Texts' included in James Hogg, Anecdotes of Scott, ed. Jill Rubenstein (Edinburgh, 1999), xxx‚Äílvi. Towards the end of the article Hogg anticipated producing a more extended portrait if Scott pre-deceased himself. He was prompted to compose this longer essay, entitled 'Anecdotes of Sir W. Scott', when he received a visit from the London publisher John M'Crone shortly after Scott's death in the autumn of 1832, sending the manuscript south at the beginning of March 1833. In the event the essay in its original form did not see the light of day until 1983, when it appeared in an edition by Douglas S. Mack published at Edinburgh by the Scottish Academic Press. John Gibson Lockhart raised objections, asserting that he ought to have been given an opportunity to ask Hogg to omit 'things that would give pain to his [Scott's] children'Rubenstein, Anecdotes of Scott, xli. and Hogg, offended in his turn, asked M'Crone to return the manuscript. However, in June 1833 Hogg agreed to entrust the work to Harper and Brothers in New York: for this purpose he prepared a fresh, substantially revised manuscript, with some new material, much reordering, and continuous small adjustments.For an analysis of the differences see J. H. Alexander, ' Anecdotes to Familiar Anecdotes ', Studies in Hogg and his World, 13 (2002), 5‚Äí15, especially 5‚Äí6. Hogg's new manuscript was censored and toned down by the American editor.Rubenstein, Anecdotes of Scott, xxvii‚Äìxxviii. ==Editions== Familiar Anecdotes of Sir Walter Scott. By James Hogg, The Ettrick Shepherd was published in April 1834 at New York by Harper & Brothers.Rubenstein Anecdotes of Scott, l. The first half of the volume was devoted to 'Sketch of the Shepherd's Life' by S. De Witt Bloodgood. A pirated version, The Domestic Manners and Private Life of Sir Walter Scott, was published by John Reid & Co. at Glasgow in June: this included footnotes by an unknown hand denigratory of Scott and Hogg.Rubenstein Anecdotes of Scott, xxviii; the edition was also published in Edinburgh and London (l).

It is a Grade II listed building. ==History== The original vestry hall The current building was commissioned as an extension to a 19th-century vestry hall which had been designed by George Elkington in the Italianate style for the Parish of St Mary Magdalen. The vestry hall had become the headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey in 1900 but was badly damaged in the Blitz during the Second World War and was subsequently demolished. A memorial to soldiers who had served in the Second Boer War was removed from the building before it was demolished and, after being in storage for some 40 years, installed in St James's Church, Bermondsey. Two stone pillers and some ironwork is all that remains of the vestry hall itself. After the vestry hall had become inadequate for the council's needs, civic leaders decided to build some new \\"municipal offices\\" to supplement the vestry hall. The site selected for the new building, which was just to the east of the vestry hall, had previously been occupied by Bermondsey Public Baths. The foundation stone for the new municipal offices was laid by the mayor, Alderman Harry Bateman, on 20 October 1928. The building was designed by Henry Tansley in the Greek Revival style and completed in 1930. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with nine bays; the central section included a large three-bay, full-height, tetrastyle Ionic order portico with a doorway on the ground floor, three windows on the first floor and a pediment above bearing the coat of arms of Bermondsey. Internally, the main atrium on the ground floor featured a grand staircase and Doric order marble columns which supported an elliptical landing on the first floor and an elliptical domed ceiling above. The new building took over the role of headquarters of the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey during the Second World War but ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged London Borough of Southwark was formed in 1965. The building continued to be used as additional workspace by Southwark Council until 2010. The building was sold to a developer, Hollybrook Homes, in December 2012. Works to convert the building into a block of apartments known as \\"Bath House Lofts\\", to a design by architects, Burwell Deakins, were completed in summer 2014. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Southwark Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1930 Category:Grade II listed government buildings Category:Bermondsey ","title":"Bermondsey Town Hall"},{"id":"63942801","text":"Pseudautomeris toulgoeti is a species of butterfly which belongs to the family of saturniids (Saturniidae). == Appearance == Medium-sized (wingspan 60-80 millimetres), brown saturniids with large eye markings on their back wings. The front wings are slightly tapered, but not sickle-shaped, most often with a long stripe. he base color of the hind wing is often reddish, the eye spot has a bluish core. == Life cycle == The larvae tend to live socially, at least as young, on different shrubs and trees. Like other saturniidae, the adults have reduced mouths, and they do not feed. The species fly at night, during the day they rest between withered leaves where they are well camouflaged. Should an animal still detect the butterfly, it opens the distortions so that the \\"staring\\" eye spots appear - this is often enough to scare away a small predator. == Urticating hair == The larvae, partly the adult butterflies, are covered with urticating hair. These release poison if you come in contact with them and can trigger skin irritation, sometimes even more serious complications. The larvae tend to sit in tight junctions on tree trunks, and are quite well camouflaged, so that one can inadvertently easily contact them. == Distribution == The detailed distribution of this species is not known. == References == * Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and some other life forms: Checklist of the species. 13.11. 2012. * Cahurel, A.

The site was north west of Doncaster and north east of Barnsley. Coal was transhipped from the colliery by the former Hull and Barnsley Railway line. The colliery had a short life of only 40 years. Geological faulting and a serious explosion in 1964 led to its closure. ==History== Work on the site started in 1924, but preliminary works at the site meant that coal was not raised until 1927. Two shafts were dug throughout 1925 and 1926 to a depth of between and . By 1927, the seams were located at a depth of , with the coal seam itself extending for . Upton mined mainly from the Barnsley Seam, but also had workings in the Beamshaw and Winter seams. Coal was taken out of the site via the former Hull and Barnsley railway line (which was being run by the London and North Eastern Railway by the time of the colliery's operation). In 1952, the National Coal Board opened the new ¬£115,000 pit-head baths at the site. The NCB also spent spent a further ¬£500,000 at Upton in an effort to get the saleable coal output to rise from per shift to . The colliery was run by the Upton Colliery Company (Bolckow Vaughan & Co. Ltd and the Cortonwood Co. Ltd) between 1924 and 1939, by Dorman Long between 1939 and 1947, and under the National Coal Board from 1947 to 1964. The colliery coal tips were cleared in the early 1970s, and the surface area of the coal mine site is now the Upton Country Park. The site now has a pond, a memorial garden and a pit winding wheel sunk into the ground. ==Incidents== * 4 June 1940 - an explosion in the Barnsley Seam at the mine killed two men outright, and injured eight others, with one dying in hospital the same night. The other seven casualties all died from extreme burns. * 20 May 1964 - an explosion in the Barnsley Seam led to an evacuation of the colliery. The area was sealed off which rendered the mine unworkable. Coupled wit the bad geology in the seams, the site was closed in November of the same year. ==Notable colliers== Charlie Williams worked in the mine during his youth and played for their own team, Upton Colliery F.C.. He was scouted by Doncaster Rovers, and post football, was recognised as one of the first black comedians in the United Kingdom. George Ashall played for Upton F.C. and was a coal-miner before his footballing career.

He portrays the emotions of a downtrodden people in elegant words and weaves verses of beautiful human poetry. Hope plays a big part in the poetry of Tanty as he conjures contrasting planes of thought into his works. The plight of the tea gardeners, their lives, a deep sense of longing along with a determined choice to elicit changes in their lives is prominent in verses of Tanty's poetry. His left-wing radicalism and sensitivity made him a voice to be reckoned with. During his time in Jorhat, Sananta Tanty came in contact with many prominent litterateurs of the state, which gave an urge to learn the Assamese language. He began writing for a magazine, then edited by Dr. Nagen Saikia and his penchant for words started gaining him notice. He is also credited with revolutionising the field of modern Assamese poetry and has emerged as an important voice within it. It is his indulgence in life of the ordinary people, prominence of society and politics upon which lies no pretense gives him legitimacy and stokes a romanticism for the working class and culture. He is one of the stalwarts in the state today in the field of literature. == References == == See also == # Category:Indian poets Category:1952 births Category:Living people ","title":"Sananta Tanty"},{"id":"63943584","text":"Richard Palmer ( ‚Äì 7 May 1805) was an English clergyman who served as Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons.

Benesch is a free speech advocate, recommending the use of counterspeech rather than censorship to delegitimize harmful speech. __NOTOC__ ==Work== Benesch was born in 1964 in New York. She is of Czech ancestry on her father's side, and her family was described as \\"upper-middle class\\". Benesch described herself as descending from \\"immigrants, refugees and people who were killed because other people had been taught to hate them\\". After graduating from Columbia University, she worked in journalism, including as staff writer for the Miami Herald in Haiti and St. Petersburg Times correspondent in Latin America. She is fluent in Spanish. Benesch earned a JD at Yale in 2001 and a LLM from Georgetown University Law Center in 2008. Benesch worked for the NGOs Amnesty International and Human Rights First, and is currently the faculty associate of Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. She founded the Dangerous Speech Project with a grant from the MacArthur Foundation. ==Views== In regulating \\"dangerous speech\\", Benesch seeks to minimize the harm to freedom of speech, and advocates the use of counterspeech over censorship. Counterspeech means responding to hate speech with empathy and challenging the hate narratives, rather than responding with more hate speech directed in the opposite direction. According to Benesch, counterspeech is more likely to result in deradicalization and peaceful resolution of conflict. Counterspeech, which seeks to delegitimize rather than stifle harmful speech, can often incorporate humor. In contrast, she believes that censorship is ineffective at stopping hate narratives. For example, a South African politician was convicted for hate speech for singing the Shoot the Boer song, but his supporters sang the song shortly after the conviction. Benesch is a critic of United States president Donald Trump, saying that he operates in a gray area of \\"dangerous speech\\" such as when he suggested that supporters should use the Second Amendment on Hillary Clinton. She describes Trump as \\"undermining the extent to which his supporters trust the essential institutions and practices of U.S. democracy\\", which she finds \\"deeply irresponsible\\". ==Benesch test== In a 2008 article, \\"Vile Crime or Inalienable Right: Defining Incitement to Genocide\\", she proposed a \\"Reasonably Probable Consequences test\\" for criminalizing incitement to genocide: #The message must be understood by the audience as a direct call to violence against the targeted group. #Speaker must have influence over their audience #The target group must have already suffered \\"recent\\" violence #Contrasting or opposing ideas must not be available (indicating that the marketplace of ideas has broken down) #Audience conditioning: the targets must be dehumanized or accused of plotting genocide against the actual perpetrators #Audience must have heard previous similar messages. Although he found the article \\"thought-provoking\\", Gregory Gordon criticized it as he favors a broader approach to criminalizing what he terms \\"atrocity speech\\", and because he believed that her criteria do not incorporate the precedent of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.

It is one of his first prose writings and was first published in Benjamin - Zeitschrift f√ºr junge Menschen in March 1947. Berhard Meyer-Marwitz included it in the list of posthumous works by Borchert in his complete works which was published by the Rowohlt Verlag in 1949. The short story is one of Wolfgang Borchert's untypically cheerful and humorous texts, and is one of his most renown works. It tells the story of the encounter of two decidedly different characters from the perspective of a young boy. Their single commonality is their lisp. The speech impediment initially leads to misunderstandings, later on, however, it becomes a means of communication and basis for the friendship of the fellow sufferers. The title refers to Sisyphus, a figure of Greek mythology, which inspires a waiter's nickname as well as it symbolises his fate. The second main character is based on Borchert's real uncle, Hans Salchow. == Plot == A young boy visits a beer garden with his mother and uncle. During the war, his uncle lost one of his legs and part of his tongue due to a gunshot wound, giving him a lisp. Despite his war injuries, he is an impressive and confident man who hasn't lost his vitality - completely different from the nature of the small, humble and assiduous waiter who is serving their table. He also has a lisp due to an innate speech impediment. When the waiter repeats the uncle's order, both think that their opposite is mocking them. While the hurt waiter refuses to tolerate the abuse, the amused uncle loudly asks to speak to the innkeeper. By now, all the guests are observing the dispute which, growing more violent, mortifies the boy and his mother. Only when the waiter proves his lisp with a note in his passport, the tension resolves in the uncle's loud, pitying laughter, and he shows his veteran passport in return. The uncle orders a couple of rounds of Asbach and the two fellow sufferers laugh and drink for a few minutes, while the waiter keeps saying the word 'Schischyphusch'. The uncle grows serious again first and asks what the exclamation meant. The embarrassed waiter apologises for his inappropriate behaviour. He explains, that he had been teased with this nickname since his school days because his classmates were amused by his pronunciation of the word 'Sisyphus'. The uncle's eyes tear up. Without saying anything, he stands up and asks to be escorted out of the restaurant, leaving the waiter alone behind at the table. Only when the boy whispers to his uncle that the waiter is crying, the uncle turns around one more time and calls him by his nickname 'Schischyphusch'. He announces that he is coming back the following Sunday as the waiter waves him goodbye with his napkin. From this encounter grows a long-lasting friendship, so that the uncle's family soon talks about his waiter. == Background == According to Bernd M. Kraske, Schischyphusch oder Der Kellner meines Onkels is another piece of writing which is based on Borchert's autobiography and own experience. The short story presents a lasting, literary memory of his uncle, Hans Salchow. Salchow, Hertha Borchert's brother, lost his leg and acquired a speech impediment in WWI. After the war, he worked his way up from an employee to the owner of a business, speculated with his fortune until he lost it, worked his way up again, and married a women with a dubious reputation, and lost his money again. In the end, he owned a restaurant on the Niendorfer Strasse, known in Hamburg as a communist meeting point called Rote Burg ('red castle'). According to Claus B. Schr√∂der, Salchow returned from the war with an unbroken courage for life. He belonged to those people who dared to conquer the world with only one leg, maybe even more so then before. Having only just escaped death, he didn't want to miss out on life. Salchow not only was one of the early car owners, a so-called gentlemen driver, but he also became a one- legged motorcycle racer, and remained a confident, sociable, hard drinking, happy individual in public as in private circles. Like an imagined life. Peter R√ºhmkorf describes Salchow as an adventurous and colourful character. The witty and life-loving uncle enjoyed the boundless admiration of his nephew. Bogdan Mirtschew argues that Borchert's maternal uncle presents as a substitute father figure, and refers to another character with an amputated leg, the one-legged man in The Man Outside. Gordon Burgess claims that the story is based on a real incident which occurred in the Restaurant Stoltenberg on the Alsterkrugchaussee 459 in Hamburg-Fuhlsb√ºttel. However, details on the date and the waiter remain unknown. Borchert wrote the, for him untypically cheerful, text in 1946, after he had returned from hospital where he had written his first longer piece of prose Die Hundeblume. As he was in need of care, his parents encouraged the actor to start writing. His mother repeatedly tried to persuade him to write about more cheerful topics because she feared for his health and could not bear his memories of prison in Die Hundeblume. Shortly after such a conversation in which Hertha Borchert had asked for 'something light, something funny', her son presented her with the script for Schischyphusch, with the words: 'Here is your funny story'. == Form and Stylistic Devices == Schischyphusch oder Der Kellner meines Onkels - like so many of Borchert's short stories which deal with childhood-related topics and which introduce family members, such as Die Kirschen or Der Stiftzahn - is written in first-person narration. He mostly uses a simple past tense. His narrative style is reminiscent of an anecdote and creates the impression of a real occurrence. Short, sojourning passages, after which the narrator has to return to the main plot by using formulations like 'so' or 'as I have mentioned before' help add to this impression, and recreate the feeling of the story being told orally. The short story begins with an introduction, which curiously includes the title in the syntax of the main text as part of the story as the first sentence directly refers to the title: 'Dabei war mein Onkel nat√ºrlich kein Gastwirt.' ('But my uncle wasn't even an innkeeper'.) The final paragraph refers back to the initial visit to the beer garden, with the uncle turning to his relatives and surroundings to explain. The story thus forms a kind of circle. Despite its abrupt beginning which is typical for the genre of short stories, K√•re Eirek Gullv√•g finds traits of a novella in Schischyphusch: introducing a combination of narrative frames and connecting the different narrative strands into a shared experience. Horst Brustmeier differentiates foreground and background story. The former describes the meeting between the uncle and the waiter, marked by situation comedy, while the latter is characterised by the tragic conflict of the human longing for understanding and connection. The lisp functions as a Leitmotif which propels the plot. The dialogue between the waiter and the uncle, which constitutes the main narrative, is characterised by a presentation of counterpoints. The climax brings the different characters' voices and moods in harmony, before they divert again. Like many other of Borchert's works, Schischyphusch concentrates on a single, incisive moment in the life of a character. The open ending leave their fate in the hands of the reader. The short story displays an array of stylistic devices common to Borchert's writing, especially, as pointed out by Karl Brinkmann, the idiosyncratic neologisms and the chains of adjectives and adverbs. Karl Migner finds that the possibility of short, concise characterisations of figures or happenings in Schischyphusch are pushing to an extreme. Similarly, Brinkmann describes the use of sibilants, that is, these for the protagonists unpronounceable sounds, grotesquely exaggerated as the lisp contrasts the Borchert's Hamburg dialect. Borchert uses stylistic climaxes to reflect the characters' growing excitement, and anti-climaxes for the continually shrinking waiter. Helmut Gumtau describes the language as characterised by an 'Arno Holzsche motor coordination of word cascades' and onomatopoeia. What is striking about it, is the abundance of alliterations and the with alcohol consumption increasing use of animal metaphors. == Interpretation == === Der Kellner und der Onkel === Der Gourmand, painting by Henri Brispot (1846‚Äì1928) The central figures of the story, the two main characters, are portrayed differently. The waiter is a stock character. He symbolises the people who are forced to serve others because of their job, and who constantly have to suppress their individuality. He does not have a name, and even his nickname Schischyphusch represents the general characteristic of someone who is fighting their fate. In contrast, the uncle with his relations is a determined, individual person who escapes anonymity. While the uncle has a large, well-meaning, wide, brown face, the waiter is described without a face. Similarly, the characters' personalities are completely different and are contrasted throughout the story. For example, one passage illustrates this difference as follows: 'Small, bitter, worked up, scatterbrained, erratic, colourless, scared, oppressed: the waiter', and 'broad, brown, humming, with a bass voice, loud, laughing, lively, rich, giant, calm, confident, satisfied, juicy - my uncle!' Despite their shared speech impediment, the two deal with it differently, a contrast sharpened by their characterisations. The waiter is weighed down by a birth defect: 'mocked, ridiculed, pitied, smirked at, shouted at', causing him to shrink day by day. On the other side, the uncle doesn't even notice his speech impediment. The certainty of his own authority eliminates any suspicion that he could be ridiculed by others. Given his posture and demeanour, he is used to command respect in others. According to Paul Riegel, he enjoys the dispute with the waiter as a demonstration of his position as a main character. Hansj√ºrgen Verweyen argues that the story opposes the Colossus of Rhodes and a goat. Zwischen den beiden gegens√§tzlichen Figuren, die mit ihrem Sprachfehler nur eine einzige Gemeinsamkeit haben, kommt es laut Horst Brustmeier zu einem Zusammenprall zweier Welten. Auf dem H√∂hepunkt der Auseinandersetzung √ºberbr√ºckt der Onkel die Kluft, indem er die H√§nde des Kellners ergreift. Das Mitleid seines Leidensgenossen erl√∂st diesen von seinem bisherigen Dasein, er wird ein ‚Äûneuer Mensch‚Äú. Mit dem Lachen tritt er in die Welt des Onkels ein, doch es gen√ºgt ein Augenblick der Ver√§rgerung seines imposanten Gegen√ºbers, und der Kellner f√ºhlt sich erneut in seine alte Welt verwiesen und wischt den Moment der Verst√§ndigung mit seiner Serviette beiseite wie einen Traum. Als er die Lebensgeschichte seines Gegen√ºbers erf√§hrt, ist es der laute Onkel, der pl√∂tzlich still und schweigsam wird. Nun treten ihm jene Tr√§nen in die Augen, die zuvor den Blick des Kellners getr√ºbt haben. Am Ende finden die beiden Leidensgenossen abermals zusammen, der Kellner wischt mit seiner Serviette endg√ºltig sein altes Leben weg, und das Motiv des Lachens l√∂st die Tr√§nen ab. Durch das Vorbild des Onkels findet der Kellner f√ºr Gordon Burgess den Mut, in Zukunft ‚Äûein Leben mit statt trotz Zungenfehler zu f√ºhren.‚Äú Tizian * Wolfgang Borchert: Schischyphusch oder der Kellner meines Onkels.

Ethylene permeates the cell membrane and binds to a receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum. The receptor releases the repressed EIN2. This then activates a signal transduction pathway which activates regulatory genes that eventually trigger an ethylene response. The activated DNA is transcribed into mRNA which is then translated into a functional enzyme that is used for ethylene biosynthesis. Ethylene (=) is an unsaturated hydrocarbon gas (alkene) acting naturally as a plant hormone. It acts at trace levels throughout the life of the plant by stimulating or regulating the ripening of fruit, the opening of flowers, the abscission (or shedding) of leaves and, in aquatic and semi-aquatic species, promoting the 'escape' from submergence by means of rapid elongation of stems or leaves. This escape response is particularly important in rice farming. Commercial fruit-ripening rooms use \\"catalytic generators\\" to make ethylene gas from a liquid supply of ethanol. Typically, a gassing level of 500 to 2,000 ppm is used, for 24 to 48 hours. Care must be taken to control carbon dioxide levels in ripening rooms when gassing, as high temperature ripening () has been seen to produce CO2 levels of 10% in 24 hours.External Link to More on Ethylene Gassing and Carbon Dioxide Control . ne-postharvest.com ==History of ethylene in plant biology== Ethylene has been used since the ancient Egyptians, who would gash figs in order to stimulate ripening (wounding stimulates ethylene production by plant tissues). The ancient Chinese would burn incense in closed rooms to enhance the ripening of pears. In 1864, it was discovered that gas leaks from street lights led to stunting of growth, twisting of plants, and abnormal thickening of stems. In 1874 it was discovered that smoke caused pineapple fields to bloom. Smoke contains ethylene, and once this was realized the smoke was replaced with ethephon or naphthalene acetic acid, which induce ethylene production.Annual Plant Reviews, Plant Hormone Signaling. Peter Hedden, Stephen G. Thomas. John Wiley & Sons, Apr 15, 2008 In 1901, a Russian scientist named Dimitry Neljubow showed that the active component was ethylene. Sarah Doubt discovered that ethylene stimulated abscission in 1917. Farmers in Florida would commonly get their crops to ripen in sheds by lighting kerosene lamps, which was originally thought to induce ripening from the heat. In 1924, Frank E. Denny discovered that it was the molecule ethylene emitted by the kerosene lamps that induced the ripening. It was not until 1934 that Gane reported that plants synthesize ethylene. In 1935, Crocker proposed that ethylene was the plant hormone responsible for fruit ripening as well as senescence of vegetative tissues. ==Ethylene biosynthesis in plants== The Yang cycle Ethylene is produced from essentially all parts of higher plants, including leaves, stems, roots, flowers, fruits, tubers, and seeds. Ethylene production is regulated by a variety of developmental and environmental factors. During the life of the plant, ethylene production is induced during certain stages of growth such as germination, ripening of fruits, abscission of leaves, and senescence of flowers. Ethylene production can also be induced by a variety of external aspects such as mechanical wounding, environmental stresses, and certain chemicals including auxin and other regulators. The pathway for ethylene biosynthesis is named the Yang cycle after the scientist Shang Fa Yang who made key contributions to elucidating this pathway. Ethylene is biosynthesized from the amino acid methionine to S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM, also called Adomet) by the enzyme Met adenosyltransferase. SAM is then converted to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) by the enzyme ACC synthase (ACS). The activity of ACS determines the rate of ethylene production, therefore regulation of this enzyme is key for the ethylene biosynthesis. The final step requires oxygen and involves the action of the enzyme ACC-oxidase (ACO), formerly known as the ethylene forming enzyme (EFE). Ethylene biosynthesis can be induced by endogenous or exogenous ethylene. ACC synthesis increases with high levels of auxins, especially indole acetic acid (IAA) and cytokinins. ==Ethylene perception in plants== Ethylene is perceived by a family of five transmembrane protein dimers such as the ETR1 protein in Arabidopsis. The genes encoding ethylene receptors have been cloned in the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana and many other plants. Ethylene receptors are encoded by multiple genes in plant genomes. Dominant missense mutations in any of the gene family, which comprises five receptors in Arabidopsis and at least six in tomato, can confer insensitivity to ethylene. Loss-of-function mutations in multiple members of the ethylene-receptor family result in a plant that exhibits constitutive ethylene responses. DNA sequences for ethylene receptors have also been identified in many other plant species and an ethylene binding protein has even been identified in Cyanobacteria. == Ethylene response to salt stress == A large portion of the soil has been affected by over salinity and it has been known to limit the growth of many plants. Globally, the total area of saline soil was 397,000,000 ha and in continents like Africa, it makes up 2 percent of the soil. The amount of soil salinization has reached 19.5% of the irrigated land and 2.1% of the dry-land agriculture around the world. Soil salinization affects the plants using osmotic potential by net solute accumulation. The osmotic pressure in the plant is what maintains water uptake and cell turgor to help with stomatal function and other cellular mechanisms. Over generations, many plant genes have adapted, allowing plants‚Äô phenotypes to change and built distinct mechanisms to counter salinity effects. The plant hormone ethylene is a combatant for salinity in most plants. Ethylene is known for regulating plant growth and development and adapted to stress conditions. Central membrane proteins in plants, such as ETO2, ERS1 and EIN2, are used for ethylene signaling in many plant growth processes. ETO2, Ethylene overproducer 2, is a protein that when mutated it will gain a function to continually produce ethylene even when there is no stress condition, causing the plant to grow short and stumpy. ERS1, Ethylene response sensor 1, is activated when ethylene is present in the signaling pathway and when mutated, it loses a function and cannot bind to ethylene. This means a response is never activated and the plant will not be able to cope with the abiotic stress. EIN2, Ethylene insensitive 2, is a protein that activates the pathway and when there is a mutation here the EIN2 will block ethylene stimulation and an ethylene response gene will not be activated. Mutations in these proteins can lead to heightened salt sensitivity and limit plant growth. The effects of salinity have been studied on Arabidopsis plants that have mutated ERS1 and EIN4 proteins. These proteins are used for ethylene signaling again certain stress conditions, such as salt and the ethylene precursor ACC is allowing suppress of any sensitivity to the salt stress. Mutations in these pathways can cause lack of ethylene signaling, causing stunt in plant growth and development. ==Environmental and biological triggers of ethylene== Environmental cues such as flooding, drought, chilling, wounding, and pathogen attack can induce ethylene formation in plants. In flooding, roots suffer from lack of oxygen, or anoxia, which leads to the synthesis of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). ACC is transported upwards in the plant and then oxidized in leaves. The ethylene produced causes nastic movements (epinasty) of the leaves, perhaps helping the plant to lose less water in compensation for an increase in resistance to water transport through oxygen-deficient roots .Explaining Epinasty. planthormones.inf == Corolla senescence == The corolla of a plant refers to its set of petals. Corolla development in plants is broken into phases from anthesis to corolla wilting. The development of the corolla is directed in part by ethylene, though its concentration is highest when the plant is fertilized and no longer requires the production or maintenance of structures and compounds that attract pollinators. The role of ethylene in the developmental cycle is as a hormonal director of senescence in corolla tissue. This is evident as ethylene production and emission are maximized in developmental phases post-pollination, until corolla wilting. Ethylene-directed senescence of corolla tissue can be observed as color change in the corolla or the wilting/ death of corolla tissue. At the chemical level, ethylene mediates the reduction in the amount of fragrance volatiles produced. Fragrance volatiles act mostly by attracting pollinators. Ethylene's role in this developmental scenario is to move the plant away from a state of attracting pollinators, so it also aids in decreasing the production of these volatiles. Ethylene production in corolla tissue does not directly cause the senescence of corolla tissue, but acts by releasing secondary products that are consistent with tissue ageing. While the mechanism of ethylene-mediated senescence are unclear, its role as a senescence-directing hormone can be confirmed by ethylene-sensitive petunia response to ethylene knockdown. Knockdown of ethylene biosynthesis genes was consistent with increased corolla longevity; inversely, up-regulation of ethylene biosynthesis gene transcription factors were consistent with a more rapid senescence of the corolla. ===List of plant responses to ethylene=== * Seedling triple response, thickening and shortening of hypocotyl with pronounced apical hook. * Stimulation of Arabidopsis hypocotyl elongation Debatosh Das,\\"Ethylene- and shade-induced hypocotyl elongation share transcriptome patterns and functional regulators\\", \\"Plant Physiology\\",21-06-2016 * In pollination, when the pollen reaches the stigma, the precursor of the ethylene, ACC, is secreted to the petal, the ACC releases ethylene with ACC oxidase. * Stimulates leaf senescence * Stimulates senescence of mature xylem cells in preparation for plant use * Induces leaf abscission * Induces seed germination * Induces root hair growth ‚Äî increasing the efficiency of water and mineral absorption * Induces the growth of adventitious roots during flooding * Stimulates survival under low-oxygen conditions (hypoxia) in submerged plant tissues * Stimulates epinasty ‚Äî leaf petiole grows out, leaf hangs down and curls into itself * Stimulates fruit ripening * Induces a climacteric rise in respiration in some fruit which causes a release of additional ethylene. * Affects gravitropism * Stimulates nutational bending * Inhibits stem growth and stimulates stem and cell broadening and lateral branch growth outside of seedling stage (see Hyponastic response) * Interference with auxin transport (with high auxin concentrations) * Inhibits shoot growth and stomatal closing except in some water plants or habitually submerged species such as rice, Callitriche (e.g., C. platycarpa), and Rumex, where the opposite occurs to achieve an adaptive escape from submergence. * Induces flowering in pineapples * Inhibits short day induced flower initiation in Pharbitus nil and Chrysanthemum morifolium ===Commercial issues=== Ethylene shortens the shelf life of many fruits by hastening fruit ripening and floral senescence. Ethylene will shorten the shelf life of cut flowers and potted plants by accelerating floral senescence and floral abscission. Flowers and plants which are subjected to stress during shipping, handling, or storage produce ethylene causing a significant reduction in floral display. Flowers affected by ethylene include carnation, geranium, petunia, rose, and many others. Ethylene can cause significant economic losses for florists, markets, suppliers, and growers. Researchers have developed several ways to inhibit ethylene, including inhibiting ethylene synthesis and inhibiting ethylene perception. Aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), Aminooxyacetic acid (AOA), and silver salts are ethylene inhibitors. Inhibiting ethylene synthesis is less effective for reducing post-harvest losses since ethylene from other sources can still have an effect. By inhibiting ethylene perception, fruits, plants and flowers don't respond to ethylene produced endogenously or from exogenous sources. Inhibitors of ethylene perception include compounds that have a similar shape to ethylene, but do not elicit the ethylene response. One example of an ethylene perception inhibitor is 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP). Commercial growers of bromeliads, including pineapple plants, use ethylene to induce flowering. Plants can be induced to flower either by treatment with the gas in a chamber, or by placing a banana peel next to the plant in an enclosed area. Chrysanthemum flowering is delayed by ethylene gas, and growers have found that carbon dioxide 'burners' and the exhaust fumes from inefficient glasshouse heaters can raise the ethylene concentration to 0.05 ppmv, causing delay in flowering of commercial crops. == References == == Further reading == * * * == External links == *International Chemical Safety Card 0475 Category:Aging-related substances in plants Category:Monomers Category:Plant hormones Category:GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators Category:Gaseous signaling molecules Category:Plant growth regulators ","title":"Ethylene as a plant hormone"},{"id":"63943827","text":"David Trimnel, D.D.

It was produced by Shyam Sapkota under the banner of Cinema Nepal. The film is set in Panchayat-era Nepal, and depicts a fictionalised version of the contemporary democracy movement. It features Hari Bansha Acharya in the lead role, alongside Anjali Lama, Madan Krishna Shrestha, Shanti Maskey, Keshav Bhattarai, Laxmi Giri and Neer Shah. The film was a critical and commercial success. In 2005, Balidaan was banned by the short-lived autocratic government headed by King Gyanendra for its portrayal of Nepal's communist movement. == Plot == One day a rebel dies after a conflict with the police officers on a campus. Bikram (B.S. Rana), the leader of the revolutionary group, expresses his sorrow for the rebel who died and sends other revolutionaries underground to hide from the police; they disperse in different areas of Nepal. Sangita (Anjali Lama) reaches Sirani village where she gets to meet Arjun (Hari Bansha Acharya), a young student. She informs him that Bikram has been arrested. Arjun works on their agenda to raise awareness to other people about their rights via their songs. The group is preparing for their revolution against the Panchayat system. Arjun and Sangita visit another village to raise awareness about democracy. On the way, they meet a retired captain (Madan Krishna Shrestha) who is not convinced by their plan. The captain tries to persuade the head of the village to allow inter-caste marriage but the head of the village refutes the idea. The captain tells the revolutionary group to perform an inter-caste marriage to convince the head of the village. Arjun and Sangita decide to marry each other, but another member of the group secretly loves her. He betrays the group and tells the police of their plan. Arjun is arrested and tortured by Senior Police Inspector Karna (Neer Shah). He is sentenced to 10 years in jail by the court. While walking out of the court, he spits on the minister who demanded the death penalty. Later, Karna is impressed by Arjun's beliefs. The officer tells him that if he will reveal the names of those who are involved in the revolutionary group they will release him, but he refuses. While Arjun is being transferred to the Palpa prison, he breaks free from the police car. The police then break up a fight between the revolutionaries and Arjun dies. Sangita gives birth to a child at the fight scene and the film ends with a song relating that Arjun gave up his life for the nation. == Cast == * Hari Bansha Acharya as Arjun * Anjali Lama as Sangita * Keshav Bhattarai as Keshav * B.S.

In September 2005, it was banned by the government of Nepal for its portrayal of Nepal's communist movement. Sudeshna Sarkar of Two Circles wrote: \\"Balidan portrayed the Communist movement of Nepal and was banned five years ago when King Gyanendra seized absolute power with the help of the army and jailed Nepal's top politicians\\". The song \\"Gaun Gaun Bata Utha\\" was adopted by the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist‚ÄìLeninist). It was previously released during the Panchayat era, composed by Shyam Tamot, and had been banned from state-owned Radio Nepal. Balidaan became a blockbuster, and was praised by the audiences for its revolutionary theme, and for the film's touching songs. In May 2015, the film was screened on satellite television station Dish Home. == Critical reception == The staff of NepaliSansar cited the film as one of the \\"best Nepali movies ever\\", alongside Chino, Darpan Chhaya, Kusume Rumal, Lahure, and Desh.

After studying in the United States and Canada, she earned a PhD from the University of Bordeaux III in 1991. Dealing with issues concerning women in society, her plays include The Mannequins (1997), Edewede (2000) and Closed Doors (2007). ==Biography== Born in Ubiaja in Nigeria's southerly Edo State, Juliana Omonukpon Omoifo is the daughter of Augustine Azamuoisa Omoifo, a teacher and court clerk, and his wife, a seamstress and store manager. Brought up in a modest household, she was the fifth in a family of eight children. Both her parents were culturally active: her father loved music and played the guitar while her mother was a traditional story teller who took part in Ikhio dance- drama performances. She is married to Joseph Donatus Okoh (born 1941), a professor specializing in education at the University of Port Harcourt. They have four children. After completing her primary education in Ubiaja, Juliana Omoifo attended Our Lady of Lourdes Secondary School in Uromi. She then found a job with the Ministry of External Affairs in Lagos where she took GCE examinations at ordinary and advanced level. Thanks to outstanding results, she was able to attend a three-year course in training as a bilingual secretary at the Federal Training Centre. In 1972, she was granted admission to Loyola University Chicago where she graduated in French and English Literature in 1976. She went on to earn a master's degree in French Literature from the University of Alberta (1979). She later attended the University of Bordeaux to study French and English Theatre, earning a master's degree in 1989 and a PhD in 1991. In 2000 and 2001, Okoh was in the United States where she was a Fulbright fellow at Smith College, taking on assignments as a guest lecturer at North Carolina State University and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. In 2004, she embarked on a lengthy career as professor of theatre theory and criticism at the University of Port Harcourt. Julie Okoh retired in 2017. In a lecture titled \\"Towards Feminist Theatre in Nigeria\\", which she presented in October 2012, Okoh concludes: > The concept of gender equality that focuses on women's rights has come a > long way, and feminist literature has played a major role in bringing about > changes in the attitude towards women. Yet, a long battle still lies ahead, > for it will take a long time for gender equality and the role of women in > society to be well understood and accepted in the ideal sense... As for me, > I have chosen the medium of the theatre as my pulpit for that purpose. I > have tried to reach out to the world with my theatre practice based on > feminist principles and techniques. ==Publications== Okoh has written and directed over 30 plays, many of which have been published, as well as critical essays and articles in both French and English on theatre, cultural and gender issues. One of her most successful plays is Edewede which was first performed at the University of Port Harcourt in 1998. It is aimed at convincing Nigerian women that excision is a tradition which should be avoided, presenting it as a harmful practice. The play includes traditional women's dances and songs, sometimes subversively. Using a lengthy sex strike as a device, the women vote to ban excision. Excision is also the theme of In the Fullness of Time, in which the audience is encouraged to participate in voting or in singing and clapping. Her plays include: *1997: Mask: A Play for Schools and Colleges *1997: The Mannequins *2000: Edewede: The Dawn of a New Day *2000: In the Fullness of Time *2002: Who Can Fight the Gods? *2005: Aisha *2007: Closed Doors *2008: The Trials *2009: A Haunting Past: Drama *2010: Our Wife Forever: Drama *2014: Cry for Democracy *2018: Thorny Path ==Awards== Okoh has been awarded numerous scholarships and awards.

(2004) 'St John, Charles George William (1809‚Äì1856)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press; online edn, accessed 11 May 2020. In his book Short Sketches of the Wild Sports and Natural History of the Highlands, he described the continuous hunt of the stag for six days and five nights, culminating in its dramatic demise on 1 October 1833. St John's account of the stalk was widely republished, and the deer has been described as \\"the most famous red stag to be recorded in the annals of British sport\\". == Background and publication history == Charles St John was an aristocratic Englishman with a lifelong interest in natural history who settled in Scotland as a young man, initially at Rosehall in Sutherland in about 1833. He spent the rest of his life fishing, shooting and observing wildlife. On 1 October 1833 he killed a large red deer stag named the Muckle Hart of Benmore. St John‚Äôs account of his pursuit of the Muckle Hart was first published in 1845, incorporated into a book review written by his friend Cosmo Innes. St John later wrote an account of the pursuit in the 1846 book The Wild Sports and Natural History of the Scottish Highlands, in which he described his encounter with the Muckle Hart in more detail. The story was re-published and anthologized widely.See, for example: * St John, Charles (1847) ‚ÄòThe Muckle Hart of Benmore‚Äô, Sydney Chronicle (New South Wales), 19 October 1847. https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/31753883 * (dedicated to the Muckle Hart) * * BB (Denys Watkins-Pitchford) (1994) The Shooting Man‚Äôs Bedside Book.

London: Jonathan Cape. == St John's account of the stalk == On a Sunday, Malcolm, the shepherd, reports to St John that he has seen the track of a hart of extraordinary size which he guesses must be the \\"muckle hart of Benmore\\" notorious for its \\"wonderful size and cunning\\". The next day, St John sets off with his trusty servant, Donald, and Bran the dog. They shoot a wildcat but see no sign of the stag. They stay the night with Malcolm at his shieling (in Scottish dialect, a shepherd's hut used during summer grazing), and the next morning they spy the stag but, when they attempt to stalk him, he winds them. They return to the shieling. On the Wednesday, St John helps Malcolm by hiding in a hole beside a dead sheep and shooting two golden eagles which had been killing his sheep. They resume the hunt but see no sign of the stag and sleep in a \\"niche in the rocks\\". On Thursday, they see a footprint but become benighted in heavy rain. In the darkness they hear a fiddle and wade a burn waist deep to enter a bothy occupied by illicit whisky distillers, where they spend the night and Donald becomes drunk. On Friday, St John resumes the hunt alone but becomes lost in the mist. He shoots and eats two grouse and bivouacs in the heather. Saturday breaks fresh and sunny. St John spies the stag and stalks him but can only take a frontal shot which nevertheless appears to kill the hart. St John lays down his rifle and approaches the prone stag with his knife. When he grabs an antler to bleed the animal it springs up and throws him to the ground. Cornered against a bank, St John throws his plaid over the stag‚Äôs head and stabs him with his knife. The stag stands at bay in a loch while St John finds he has to pare a bullet with his knife to fit it into the rifle before he can shoot the hart in the head. == The trophy == In his accounts, St John does not describe the antlers other than to comment on first seeing the hart: \\"What a stretch of antler!\\" St John‚Äôs descendants reported that the Muckle Hart was a very heavy stag weighing .. Years after the stalk, Lionel Edwards and Harold Frank Wallace examined the mounted antlers of the Muckle Hart, which they described as \\"a well shaped head with thick horn, and very good brow points 13 inches long\\". Their photograph of the mounted head appears in their 1927 book Hunting and Stalking the Deer. == Legacy and analysis == The Muckle Hart became legendary and was influential in the development of Scottish red deer stalking. The Muckle Hart has been described as \\"the most famous Scottish head which has ever been killed, probably the most famous head ever killed, at any rate to the English speaking world.\\" St John's account of the stalk has been described as a \\"classic for all time\\" among deer-stalkers.Cameron, A.G. (1923) The Wild Red Deer of Scotland. Blackwood: London and Edinburgh In the 21st century, St John's account has been taken as an exemplar of the romanticised 19th-century combat between the hardy English stalker alone in the wild Scottish Highlands and the massive, noble, native Scottish antlered red deer stag. It is an example of the often embellished accounts of deer-stalking in \\"florid prose\\" characteristic of the era; Hayden Lorimer describes St John's account as \\"scarcely credible\\". St John‚Äôs account of the stalk of the Muckle Hart has been retold by many authors. == Notes == == References == == Works cited == * == Further reading == * Whitehead, G.

He has been working in the district of Tin Shui Wai, Yuen Long District for many years. He has served as a member of the Yuen Long District Council since October 1994 and has been re-elected five times until his re-election failed in 2019. Chow Wing Kan and Chow Liang Shuk-yee jointly formed the list to represent the Liberal Party in the 2008 Hong Kong Legislative Council election in the New Territories West Constituency, but both failed. In the 2016 Hong Kong Legislative Council election, he once again competed for the New West seat with a one-person list, but he expressed threat at the election forum to stop all election activities. == Early life == Chow Wing Kan was born in the Tuen Mun District of Hong Kong and is an original inhabitant of the New Territories. Chow lived in Leung Tin Village, Tuen Mun when he was small. When he was young, he and Junius Ho attended the Leung Tin Kindergarten opened by Ho's mother and maintained friendly exchanges. When Chow was in elementary school, he was enrolled in the Chinese Christian Church's Watson Elementary School, and became a Christian under the influence of the school. When Chow was in middle school, his family moved to Yuen Long to live. After graduating from university, Chow served as the corrections officer in the Hong Kong Correctional Services Department. He also stopped working in the church due to the need to work overnight shifts. Chow earlier assisted Tang's parliamentary work in the Tang Sui-tong office of the Rural Committee. The two joined the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance. Finally, Chow became Tang's assistant. In the early 1990s, the development of Tin Shui Wai New Town began to take shape. Tang commissioned Chow to represent the rural party in the election of the newly added Tin Shui constituency seats in the 1994 Hong Kong Local elections, and Chow also started his political career. === Colonial period === In 1994, the Hong Kong District Council election. The Yuen Long District Council, in response to the increase in the population of Tin Shui Village in Tin Shui Wai, delineated the new Tin Shui Constituency. In the new village, Pro-Beijing camp (Hong Kong), which have traditional power, are competing with foreign parties. Chow Wing Kan finally won 2,093 votes with the support of Tang Siu-tong. The opponent Liberal Party Yeung Yan-fai received only 100 votes. Chow won 96% of the votes and was elected as a member of the Yuen Long District Council at the age of 27. He actively explored the Tin Shui Wai area for work after and afterwards. He believed that Hong Kong ‚Äôs good economy has enabled nuclear families to actively invest in the community after moving into new towns and the society is thriving. After he took office in October 1994, a series of sex crimes occurred in Tin Shui Wai. A female victim notified him of the identified person involved and Chow lured him to the office for police to arrest on the spot. Since then, Chow has repeatedly attacked crimes in Tin Shui Wai. During the colonial period, the opposition villagers were very dissatisfied with the British Hong Kong government. In the 1995 Hong Kong Legislative election, Governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten adopted direct elections, so that the New Territories West Constituency, which has been dominated by the rural party, was also replaced by the Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong). After the election, the Registration and Electoral Office announced that about 6,000 out of a total of 110,000 voters in Tuen Mun and Yuen Long districts had failed to vote. Chow, who was Tang Siu-tong ‚Äôs deputy, personally submitted an election petition to the High Court. Chow found 108 victims who made mistakes in registration in 1996, hoping to rush to re-election before returning, but the High Court ruled that voter registration is not an election procedure and cannot overturn the results of the election. Chow, who lost the case, still thinks the trial is unfair. Despite the Handover of Hong Kong, a large number of Gurkha soldiers in the British Forces Overseas Hong Kong settled with their families in Hong Kong after retiring. Chow Wing Kan understands that they have difficulty adapting to Hong Kong society, so he decides to serve as a consultant for many South Asian ethnic groups to help them integrate into Hong Kong society. At the same time, new immigrants from Mainland China have also moved into Tin Shui Wai one after another, which is also not suitable for Culture of Hong Kong. The new residents, together with the original Tin Shui Wai residents, have greatly increased the population and density of the district, which has caused many community problems such as insufficient school degrees. In the early days of the reunification, Tin Shui Wai Jumper happened frequently, and Chow personally persuaded at least 13 people to give up suicide. In 1999, Chow and his engineers revealed the Tin Chung Court short pile case, forcing the Hong Kong Housing Authority to pay HK $250 million for reinforcement works. Chow has always been concerned about the quality of the reinforcement works during the reinforcement works. At the same time, he also questioned whether the Housing Authority has properly monitored the construction works on other issues of Tin Chung Court. Chow pointed out that increasing attention to promote community building requires the support of different channels. He organized various activities in the Tin Shui Wai District, such as singing activities such as Cantonese opera and Cantopop music, organized volunteer networks, and youth groups such as Scouting and Taekwondo teams in order to make the community more harmonious. Chow said that the Tin Hang Village and the subsequent mass destruction in 2004, the Hong Kong government began to adjust the development strategy of the new town in Tin Shui Wai. As a Christian, Chow is very concerned about the crime of church organization. In 2004, he also provided information to the Hong Kong police Force on the incident of hydrogen peroxide drinking promoted by members of the Hong Kong Church of Zion, including church members, meeting places, audio tapes and victim cases. Eventually, the missionary activities of the Church of Zion disappeared on the streets of Tin Shui Wai. In the same year, he was invited by the CCC Fong Yun Wah Secondary School to serve as the school manager and returned to the church at the invitation of the pastor. After the reunification, Chow was re-elected for many terms in Yuen Long District Council. He won again in the Tin Shui Constituency with a 84% vote in the 1999 Hong Kong local elections. Although the constituencies in the 2003 Hong Kong local elections changed, the original Shui Wah constituency merged with the 1999 Tin Wah Village to form the Shui Wah constituency, but Chow did not challenge his opponent in this election, and was automatically re-elected as a member of the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance. After Tang Siu-tong retired, Chow, who worked well in the region, was favored by Lau wong-fat and invited by Lau to join the Liberal Party. In 2004, he became Lau ‚Äôs manager and became a representative of the rural and institutional factions in Yuen Long. After joining the Liberal Party in 2004, Chow Wing Kan continued to work in the district of Tin Shui Wai, and was re-elected in the Shui Wah Constituency with a 81% vote in the 2007 Hong Kong local elections. In the 2008 Hong Kong Legislative election, he was nominated by the Liberal Party for the New Territories West Constituency. He joined the list of Selina Chow who has been a member of the legislature since 1981, and she was behind her to help her re- elect. However, because the Liberal Party did not support Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 to offend the Hong Kong Liaison Office, he and other members of the rural party voted with other formed political parties, and he also joined the Liberal Party member Lau Wong-fat on the election day for the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong Entering the league to solicit votes, Serena Chow failed to be re-elected, and Chow Wing Kan also failed to be elected. The Liberal Party's defeat triggered Chow Liang Shuk- yee's resignation as vice chairman and a large-scale withdrawal from the party. After joining the party, Lau joined the Business and Professionals Alliance and invited Chow Wing Kan to join, but Chow refused. Although Chow Wing Kan still maintains a good relationship with Lau Wong-fat in private, Chow remains in the Liberal Party and is no longer a political ally of Lau. In the 2011 Hong Kong local elections, Chow faced challenges from the Civic Party Lau Koon-Hang and the institutional independent Ko Chun-Kit in the Shui Wah constituency. In the end, Chow was re-elected with more than half of the votes. However, in the 2012 Hong Kong Legislative election, the Liberal Party did not nominate Chow to be elected. Instead, he fully supported James Tien‚Äôs return to the Legislative Council in the New Territories East constituency. Changjiang Industrial holds a majority stake in Fujiahu, the shopping mall where the former Deyi Kindergarten is located. In 2014, the Tin Shui Wai shopping mall increased the rent of Fortune Kingswood, which led to the closure of Topkids International Pre-School. Chow found that the Li Ka-shing family's Cheung Kong Holdings owned more than half of the mall's equity, which caused the public to put pressure on Li's. He even attended the forum as a guest to protest the rent increase without being invited by the city forum. Although in the end, kindergartens could not change the results of the suspension, but in the District Council report later that week, kindergartens lacked government support and believed that the government needs to take more responsibility for early childhood education. ==References== Category:Indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories in Hong Kong Category:Hong Kong Protestants Category:Alumni of the City University of Hong Kong Category:Alumni of the Open University of Hong Kong Category:Alumni of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Category:Alumni of the Chinese University of Hong Kong Category:1966 births Category:Living people ","title":"Zhou Yongqin"},{"id":"63944352","text":"Karl Ottomar Treibmann (14 January 1936 ‚Äì 13 February 2017) was a German composer and music educator.

She was inspired to pursue a career in neurosurgery after her mother died from breast cancer that had metastasized to her brain when Liau was in her third year of residency. ==Career and research== Liau is currently the chair of the Department of Neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, making her the second woman in the United States, and the first Asian-American woman, to chair an academic neurosurgical department. Liau's primary research interest is the treatment of glioblastoma, a deadly form of brain cancer. Apart from surgical treatment, she has also worked on immunotherapy, and in the 1990s created one of the first personalized vaccines against brain cancer by using a sample of a patient's own tumor and white blood cells to activate an immune response against the cancer. She has since pioneered the use of dendritic cell-based vaccines in the treatment of glioblastoma. Other research she has performed includes the development of new techniques to map brain function during brain surgeries while the patient is awake. ==Personal life== Liau is married to Marvin Bergsneider, also a neurosurgeon at UCLA, with whom she has two children. ==References== Category:Living people Category:American neurosurgeons Category:American neuroscientists Category:Women surgeons Category:David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA faculty Category:Brown University alumni Category:Stanford Medical School alumni Category:Members of the National Academy of Medicine Category:Physicians from California Category:American women neuroscientists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Linda Liau"},{"id":"63944575","text":"Hythe to Calshot Marshes is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest which stretches along the west bank of Southampton Water between Calshot and Marchwood in Hampshire.

The old municipal offices had been established as the offices of the Sutton Urban District Council and went on to become the headquarters of the Municipal Borough of Sutton and Cheam in 1934.Frederic A Youngs Jr., A Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Vol I: Southern England, London, 1979 They continued to be the local seat of government when the enlarged London Borough of Sutton was formed in 1965 but, having been assessed as uneconomic to maintain, were demolished in 1971. In the 1960s civic leaders had decided to procure new civic offices: the site they selected was occupied by three large private houses. They decided that the new civic offices, which would take over the role of headquarters of the London Borough of Sutton, would form part of a larger complex involving the civic offices to the south, a public library to the west and Sutton College to the north. It was also intended to have a separate building for the council chamber but this was never built for financial reasons. The new building, which was designed by the assistant borough architect, Charles Sierakowski, in the modernist style, was completed in phases between 1972 and 1975. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage onto St Nicholas Way with a canopied glass entrance to the civic offices and to the public library on the left, and a canopied glass entrance to the college on the right: there were continuous rows of glazing with brickwork above and below on the first, second and third floors throughout the complex. In the absence of a purpose-built council chamber, a multi-purpose area within the public library known as the \\"Europa Gallery\\" was designated as available for use by the borough council for their meetings. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Sutton Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1975 Category:Sutton, London ","title":"Sutton Civic Offices"},{"id":"63944707","text":"The 2010‚Äì11 Hellenic Football League season was the 58th in the history of the Hellenic Football League, a football competition in England. ==Premier Division== Premier Division featured 17 clubs which competed in the division last season, along with five new clubs: *Bracknell Town, relegated from the Southern Football League *Slimbridge, promoted from Division One West *Thame United, promoted from Division One East *Wokingham & Emmbrook, promoted from Division One East *Wootton Bassett Town, promoted from Division One West ===League table=== ==Division One East== Division One East featured 13 clubs which competed in the division last season, along with one new club: *Hungerford Town reserves, promoted from Reserve Division One ===League table=== ==Division One West== Division One West featured twelve clubs which competed in the division last season, along with three new clubs, relegated from the Premier Division: *Bicester Town *Hook Norton *Malmesbury Victoria ===League table=== ==References== ==External links== * Hellenic Football League 2010-11 9 ","title":"2010‚Äì11 Hellenic Football League"},{"id":"63944719","text":" thumb The Opus Theatre was founded by British-Argentine composer and concert pianist Polo Piatti and officially opened on 7 July 2017 in Hastings,in the United Kingdom.

He was skilled in architecture and perspective and was an expert in music. As custodian of the Marciana Library (1737‚Äì1778), he compiled the first modern catalogs of the manuscript collection with detailed bibliographical information. ==Life== Antonio Maria was born in the parish of San Giacomo dell'Orio in Venice on 1 January 1706. He was the elder of two sons. The family of his father, Alessandro Zanetti, belonged to the citizen class, whereas the family of his mother, Antonia Limonti, originated in Milan.Zanetti, Girolamo, 'Memoria' At an unknown later date, the family transferred to the parish of Santa Maria Mater Domini.Zorzi, La libreria di san Marco‚Ä¶, p. 258 As a youth, Antonio Maria studied with the Jesuits. He had a particular aptitude for the classics and, overtime, became proficient in Greek.Zorzi, La libreria di san Marco‚Ä¶, p. 260 He also learned to paint under the guidance of Nicol√≤ Bambini. Most importantly, he became a proteg√© of his homonymous older cousin Antonio Maria Zanetti and developed into a distinguished scholar of the antiquities and an art connoisseur. Beginning in the early 1720s, Zanetti collaborated with his elder cousin on the edition of a two-volume work illustrating the classical sculpture conserved in the Venetian public collections. For this work, Zanetti provided many of the drawings of the statues. The engraving plates were made primarily by Giovanni Antonio Faldoni along with Giuseppe Camerata, Giovanni Cattini, Carlo Orsolini, Marco Alvise Pitteri, and Giuseppe Patrini. Although the initial project called for the presentation of all of the classical statues in the public collections, the two volumes of Delle antiche statue greche e romane, che nell'antisala della Libreria di San Marco, e in altri luoghi pubblici di Venezia si trovano, published in 1740 and 1743, only present 100 pieces. These were primarily from the Public Statuary but also include five statues in the courtyard of the Doge's Palace, the four horses of Saint Mark's Basilica, and the lions of the Arsenal.Zorzi, La libreria di san Marco..., p. 266 During this time, Zanetti was also tasked by Lorenzo Tiepolo, the state librarian, with compiling a complete two-volume catalog with detailed descriptions of the 224 statues belonging to the Public Statuary, located within the Marciana Library.Zorzi, La libreria di san Marco..., p. 255The manuscript is conserved in BNM ms. It. IV, 122 (=5101). In 1736, Tiepolo also asked Zanetti, together with Antonio Bongiovanni, to catalog the manuscripts in the library.

He was born in Glasgow into a family that encouraged and valued his natural artistic ability. He exhibited at the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts when aged 22, and two years later he had a painting selected for the Royal Academy, in London. In 1875‚Äì80 he attended the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris, and he was influenced by the French school of rustic naturalism and also by French Impressionism. Working plein- air, he developed a loose, painterly approach to landscape subjects. He was a prolific artist who travelled widely in Europe, India, Japan, the Middle East and America; however, he drew particular inspiration from the north-east coast of Scotland ‚Äì a subject to which he returned throughout his life. He exhibited extensively in London, Glasgow and Edinburgh, and became vice-president of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours. He was equally at home with oil painting, and during his lifetime he had 84 paintings selected for exhibition at the Royal Academy. For the last 60 years of his life his home was in London, and he died there at the age of 90 in 1942. == Artistic ambitions == Home from the Herring Fishing, oil painting, 1876 Robert Weir Allan was born in Glasgow on 11 November 1851. In partnership with the engraver William Ferguson, his father, David Allan, had built up a successful printing and publishing business that operated from Argyll Street in the centre of the city.George Fairfull Smith, Allan and Ferguson's Views in Glasgow. Robert ('Bob') was the seventh of eight children.Ancestry.com, 1861 Scotland census. Parents: David Allan, 51 [his age on the 1861 census is given as 57; this appears to be a transcription error as the 1851 census and 1871 census both give his birth date as c.1810] and Catherine Allan, 44 [n√©e Glassford]. Children: Mary S Allan, 24; Alexander Glassford Allan, 15; John G Allan, 13; Robt W Allan, 9; James A Allan, 5. The 1851 census shows three older siblings not recorded in 1861: David Allan (born c.1832), Catherine Glassford Allan (born c.1841) and Christina Glassford Allan (born c.1843). He grew up in a household that appreciated art: his father 'dabbled a little with colours' and owned a small collection of paintings.Mrs Arthur Bell (N. D'Anvers), 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', International Studio, vol. 14, no. 56 (October 1901), p. 229. The 1871 census shows that 'Allan and Ferguson' was very much a family business, with Catherine, Chrestina (sic ‚Äì presumably Christina), John and James Allan all being 'lithographers', while Robert and his younger brother, James, were described as 'artist lithographers'.Ancestry.com, 1871 Scotland census: 263 New City Rd, Maryhill, Glasgow. Household: David Allan, 61; Catherine G. Allan, lithographer, 30; 'Chrestina' G. Allan, lithographer, 28; John G. Allan, lithographer, 23; Robert W. Allan, artist lithographer, 29; James A. Allan, artist lithographer, 16. It is likely that David Allan's wife died before this census date. It had been assumed by his parents that Robert would carry on the business, but 'so strong ‚Ä¶ was Robert Allan's love of art ‚Ä¶ that his parents wisely allowed him to follow his bent.'Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 229. In 1873 his oil painting A Sunny Day at the Sea was exhibited at the Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts, and two years later his ambition to be an artist was further fuelled with the selection of Waiting the Tide for the Royal Academy's summer exhibition in London.His address in the Royal Academy catalogue for 1875 was 188 St Vincent Street, Glasgow. These seafaring subjects were executed at the time when his older brother Alexander Glassford Allan became a qualified ship's captain.Ancestry.com: Alexander Glassford Allan qualified as 'second mate' on 3 February 1868 and as 'master' on 21 April 1873. Later in 1875, David Allan died, providing Robert and his siblings with a useful inheritence.1875 Scotland, National Probate Index (Calendar of Confirmations and Inventories), 1876‚Äì1936: probate for David Allan (Lithographer) 27 January 1876.

The total amounts to about ¬£492,000 in 2019's terms. == 'Careful yet careless days' == Feeling the need for formal art training, Robert Allan took the bold step of moving to Paris, where he attended the Acad√©mie Julian from 1875 to 1880.Acad√©mie Julian archives. The Acad√©mie was welcoming of foreign students and was regarded as a stepping stone to the prestigious Ecole des Beaux-Arts, where Allan trained under Alexandre Cabanel.Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 230. Allan hired a studio in the Boulevard d'Enfer, where his bare walls became covered with sketches and studies. The community of English-speaking fellow art students were very supportive of each other ‚Äì former Slade School of Art student Arthur Bell and Belgian-British writer Nancy Meugens (later Mrs Bell)Arthur George Bell fl.1849‚Äì1916 (Suffolk Artists website). Nancy Regina Emily Meugens (1844‚Äì1933) wrote under the pen-name N. D'Anvers, and published her International Studio magazine article on Allan under the name 'Mrs. Arthur Bell'. were frequent visitors. In an article in International Studio magazine, Nancy describes the 'hard-work and frugal living' of those 'careful yet careless days'. Allan had a 'deeply interesting personality, with a rare power of winning the hearts of those with whom he was brought in contact'.Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 230. To keep homesickness at bay, porridge was eaten, 'a store of the wherewithal having been sent for from the northern home in a goodly sack'.Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 232. == Watercolour and plein-air work == As Allan would always remain a landscape painter, it is difficult to assess what he took from a training as centred on life-study classes as was that of the Acad√©mie. Mrs Bell notes that Allan's years in Paris coincided with the emergence of Jules Bastien-Lepage as the leader of the French 'rustic naturalist' plein-air movement, and it was he 'who exercised perhaps more influence on [Allan] than did any of the men under whose direct criticism he studied'.Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 232. Allan was using the spontaneity of the watercolour medium for a series of plein-air studies of coastal and market views that he sent back to English and Scottish exhibitions.French Fishing Boat with Figures, Cancale and Village Well in Brittany were exhibited at the Glasgow Institute in 1876. His bold and painterly style was inspired to some extent by the Impressionists, whose exhibitions were a cause c√©l√®bre in Paris in 1875‚Äì6. In 1878 Allan was visited by his friend Arthur Melville, a young artist from East Lothian.The sale of Arthur Melville's A Cabbage Garden, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1878, provided funds for his trip to Paris ‚Äì see National Galleries Scotland website, Arthur Melville, A Cabbage Garden. Together they travelled in Normandy and Brittany, producing coastal views and rural subjects.Christopher Brickley, 'Arthur Melville and Presbyterian Realism,' PhD thesis, University of St Andrews, 1996, p. 153: 'The parallels in subject matter, dates and locations suggest definite contact between the artists throughout Melville's stay in France.' In Paris, Melville also studied at the Acad√©mie Julian,As Arthur Melville is not recorded in the Acad√©mie Julian archives, it is possible that this was a part-time or short-stay attendance. and he stayed at Allan's studio in the Boulevard d'Enfer. Mrs Bell recalls that 'The Scotch songs sung, the wild reels danced in Mr. Allan's studio, which sometimes alarmed the natives admitted to share in the revels, kept home memories alive.'Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 232. An oil portrait of Robert Allan by Arthur Melville dating from 1878 was dedicated 'A mon ami R W Allan'.Brickley, 'Arthur Melville and Presbyterian Realism', p. 158, and on p. 153 Brickley suggests that the watercolour portrait in Aberdeen Art Gallery is a study for the now lost oil. Through Allan, Melville was introduced to watercolour painting and the innovative technique ‚Äì which critics would describe as 'blottesque'In an article in the Evening Mail of 31 May 1867 it is claimed that the term, as a nickname, was coined by John Ruskin. Arthur Melville was a more extreme exponent of the technique, and this is discussed in Brickley, 'Arthur Melville and Presbyterian Realism', pp. 35 117. ‚Äì where blots and runs were used to suggest form. == Making his mark == Funeral of Thomas Carlyle: the oil painting was probably completed somewhat later than the watercolour, c.1882 During the summer vacation of 1879 Robert Allan revisited Scotland ‚Äì an oil painting August in Fifeshire was selected for the Royal Academy the following year, and several watercolours such as Village of CrailDaily Review, 2 February 1880. and Fishing Boats in a Harbour also date from this time. After completing his studies in Paris in 1880 he visited Spain,A 'Spanish subject' was exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy exhibition in February 1881. This may have been the watercolour Market Place, Grenada that had been purchased by John Forbes White, a wealthy Aberdeen flour-mill owner, and which was subsequently sold by him in 1888 (Aberdeen Press and Journal, 3 December 1888). before returning to Scotland as a base,His address in the Royal Academy catalogue for 1880 was 126 Renfield Street, Glasgow and in the autumn of that year he painted further Fife-located subjects.A watercolour of the Island of May (located off the Firth of Forth) is inscribed 'To my friend James Duncan, September 1880', and Leuchars Parish Church (in Fife) was exhibited in February 1881 at the Royal Scottish Academy (Glasgow Herald, 28 February 1881). Ironically, it was through a non-typical work that Allan 'made his mark outside of his immediate art-circle'. Mrs Bell explains that, 'owing to a fortunate conjunction of circumstances', Robert Allan was the only artist who witnessed the interment of the writer Thomas Carlyle, on 10 February 1881 in Ecclefechan, Dumfriesshire.Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 234. His watercolour Funeral of Thomas Carlyle owes more to the French rustic naturalist school than is evident in most of his work. When it was exhibited at the Glasgow Institute in September 1881 the Galloway News described it as 'the picture of the Exhibition ‚Ä¶ Mr. Allan ‚Ä¶ is one of our best water-colour painters, but such a great work as this will make for him an enduring reputation in the art world. The drawing is ‚Ä¶ an artistic trophy, worthy of our National galleries.'Galloway News and Kirkcudbrightshire Advertiser, 9 September 1881 ‚Äì review of the fourth exhibition of the Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour, held at the Glasgow Institute. Perhaps in response to this suggestion, Allan worked the watercolour up as an oil painting.The Aberdeen Evening Express of 30 November 1887 notes that Funeral of Thomas Carlyle was exhibited in at the Aberdeen Artists' Society. In the context of the article it appears to be the oil-painting version of the composition. The oil painting was gifted to Glasgow Museums by the artist in 1911. Allan revisited the subject with a further watercolour drawing and also an etching exhibited at the Royal Academy, London, in 1885. An etching of this subject is in the National Trust Collection (NT 263471), where it is credited to 'Robin Alan'. == Aberdeeenshire and European travel == Venice with view of San Giorgio Maggiore ‚Äì oil painting ‚Äì date unknown In the summer of 1881 Allan travelled up Scotland's east coast to Aberdeenshire ‚Äì coastal views of this area would become his archetypical subjects. A later article in a local newspaper, 'Tribute from Fraserburgh', explains: 'For this particular locality no painter has done so much as has Robert W. Allan. Coming here some 28 years ago [c.1881], he was fascinated by the grey skies, the ever-toiling sea with its burden of hardy fishermen in their brown and purple boats ‚Äì a charm that has never left him ‚Ä¶ there is no truer or loftier exponent or interpreter of our East Coast scenery than is to be found in this charming artist.'Fraserburgh Herald and Northern Counties Advertiser, 30 March 1909. Allan was a prolific, hard-working and popular artist. He travelled widely in Europe, and brought back watercolours that often included recognisable locations such as the Doge's Palace, Venice; Notre-Dame, Paris; and Dutch canal viewsMoored Boats outside the Cathedral at Dordrecht (the Netherlands), signed and dated 1882. while avoiding clich√©. His work was widely exhibited, sold well, and received encouraging press notices. 'Southwark Bridge, London ‚Ä¶ with barges in the foreground, [is] diffused with fine colour against a soft grey sky, full of atmosphere and fine quality, such as no other picture in the exhibition shows,' one reviewer commented.Galloway News and Kirkcudbrightshire Advertiser, 9 September 1881, in reference to an exhibition at the Glasgow Institute. In 1883‚ÄòDistinction and Wide Variety in Robert Weir Allan‚Äôs Paintings‚Äô, Christian Science Monitor (Boston, Mass.), 4 January 1913. Allan took a studio in Haverstock Hill, Hampstead,Avon House, 33 Steele's Road, Haverstock Hill, Hampstead (from 1880 to 1885). and would make London his base for the rest his life ‚Äì placing him in the centre of the British art world while also giving him access to Scotland through the rapidly developing railway routes.In 1885 the journey time from London to Edinburgh was nine hours. == In the heart of the city == In the mid-1880s Allan was living in a two-room flat on the third floor of 27 Piccadilly in the heart of London's art world.Ancestry.com, 1888 Electoral Register. Allan used his proximity to London's exhibiting societies to exhibit widely: with the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours (RI), which had just moved into new exhibiting galleries on Piccadilly; the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours (RWS) ‚Äì also known as the Old Water-Colour Society ‚Äì whose headquarters were in Pall Mall and whose exhibitions were held at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly; the Society of British Artists (SBA), which exhibited in Suffolk Street (just off Pall Mall); and the Royal Academy, at Burlington House, Piccadilly. In reviewing a SBA exhibition at Suffolk Street in 1883, the Dundee Advertiser singled out Robert Allan and Arthur Melville as Scottish artists 'of note'. Commenting on Arriving from the Herring Fishing, it declared, 'Allan has won a position for himself in England more easily and more rapidly perhaps than any other young Scottish artist. His Continental studies prepared him for a thorough interpretation of the marine scenery on the east coast of Scotland, and he has wrought up this subject with great success.Dundee Advertiser, 1 May 1883. == 'A French orientation' == Arriving From the Ferry water-colour painting with a view of Dordrecht (Holland),1888 Despite resistance from the London art establishment, painting in the progressive French manner was starting to percolate through exhibitions at the Grosvenor Gallery and the New English Art Club (founded in 1886). The Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours gave a 'nod to impressionism' by electing Robert Allan an associate in 1887 (and Arthur Melville in 1888). 'Though not an impressionist, Allan did share with his compatriots a taste for plein-air painting and a French orientation.'Scott Wilcox and Christopher Newall, Victorian Landscape Watercolors (New York: Hudson Hills Press, 1992), p. 48. The Queen's Jubilee Procession of 1887 is praised by Mrs Bell for 'the artist's bold brush-work, ‚Ä¶ and his various Dutch scenes, notably his Lowlands of Holland [of c.1889], are perhaps especially remarkable for increased freedom of handling, and for the nearest approach made by their gifted author to what may be called the earlier phase of Impressionism.'Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 236.The Dundee Courier also noted that The Lowlands of Holland at the Glasgow Institute in 1890 was 'a very distinct advance'.Dundee Courier, 5 February 1890. Allan maintained an individualistic approach to his art, aligning himself neither with British Impressionists nor with the Glasgow School, which was 'fast coming to be recognised as a new force and power, especially in the landscape art of the country'.The Scotsman, 13 December 1890. The 'Glasgow School' ‚Äì retrospectively known as the 'Glasgow Boys' ‚Äì was a diverse grouping of artists including James Paterson (1854‚Äì1932), William York Macgregor (1855‚Äì1923), James Guthrie (1859‚Äì1930), John Lavery (1856‚Äì1941) and Thomas Millie Dow (1848‚Äì1919). Mrs. Bell's International Studio article draws on conversations with Allan in which he makes it clear that he 'was not, as is so often taken for granted, a member of the Glasgow School'.Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 229. In 1889 he was awarded a silver medal at the Exposition Universelle in Paris.The Catalogue of the Fifth Annual Exhibition at the Carnegie Institute, (Pittsburgh: Carnegie Institute, 1900). == Young India == The Ghats at Benares (detail), 1891 'Mr R.W. Allan and his sketching- cart', published in Young India in 1891 Inspired perhaps by the success of Arthur Melville's watercolour paintings of oriental subjects, in the winter of 1890‚Äì91 Allan embarked on a long trip to India with his friend the politician and temperance advocate William Sproston Caine, who was undertaking a political tour of that country. Allan had been invited to contribute watercolour illustrations for a publication that would be entitled 'Young India'.W. S. Caine, Young India: A Series of Letters Written for the Pall Mall Gazette during a Political Tour in India in the Winter of 1890-91 ( London: Pall Mall Gazette, 1891). On return, he exhibited the watercolours Service in a Sikh Temple, The Street in Delhi, The Water Carriers of Gwalior and Oudeypore at the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours winter exhibition. The Glasgow Herald considered that 'Mr. Robert W. Allan's work is as strong as it has ever been, and more brilliant in colour ‚Ä¶ there is nothing more to be said than that even Mr Allan has never done better work.'Glasgow Herald, 28 November 1891. Oudeypore was worked up as an oil painting and exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1892. By this time Allan was living at 2 Spenser Street, Victoria. == Consolidating his reputation == Rosehearty, Aberdeenshire, water- colour painting c.1905 Paris water-colour painting 1905 Through the Royal Anglo-Australian Society of Artists, a watercolour Arriving from the Ferry was purchased for the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney in 1890, and in the same year an oil painting Kirkwall, Orkney was purchased by public subscription for Dunedin Public Art Gallery in New Zealand. Critics were now more accepting of his 'vivid modernity of style', despite its seeming 'oddly out of place in Pall Mall East. Of the excellence of his drawings, however, there can be no possible shadow of doubt. Best of them all, perhaps, is his Montrose (No. 22), a most convincing view of what one feels that cold, grey Scottish town must be like on a hopelessly sloppy day.'Truth, 25 April 1895. The following year he was made a full member of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours.Simon Fenwick and Greg Smith (eds.), The Business of Watercolour: A Guide to the Archives of the Royal Watercolour Society (Aldershot: Ashgate, 1997). Allan seems to have now been equally at home with oil painting, and each year for the next three decades (with few exceptions) he would have at least one oil painting selected for the Royal Academy summer exhibition. The subjects were largely of the Aberdeenshire coast, such as Ford between North Uist and Benbecula exhibited at the RA in 1894 and purchased four years later by Aberdeen Corporation for ¬£600.Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', p. 237; Fraserburgh Herald and Northern Counties Advertiser, 30 March 1909. In 1900 All Hands on Deck received an 'honourable mention' at the Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh,The Catalogue of the Fifth Annual Exhibition at the Carnegie Institute, (Pittsburgh: Carnegie Institute, 1900). and Allan was then invited to serve on the jury for a future Carnegie Institute exhibition.The Scotsman, 22 September 1904. == An elder statesman == Temple at Nikko, Japan oil painting from 1907 Yasaka Pagoda, Kyoto watercolour, 1907 In his fifties, Allan became something of an elder statesman within the London art scene. He had moved to 62 Buckingham Gate, Westminster,Ancestry.com, 1901 England census: address, 62 Buckingham Gate, Westminster; age, 49; profession, 'Artist Sculpt[or]' (sic). and received the accolade of two high-profile articles in International Studio magazine.Bell, 'Robert Weir Allan and His Work', pp. 229‚Äì37, and T. Martin Wood, 'Robert W. Allan's Recent Paintings and Drawings', International Studio, vol. 37, no. 146 (April 1909), pp. 89‚Äì100. He became vice-president of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1908, and the society seems to have commissioned his portrait from Dorothea Landau (1881‚Äì1941).The portrait is owned by the Royal Watercolour Society. In 1910 he was vice-president of the Royal British Colonial Society of Artists.The Times, 29 April 1910. The president of the society was William Ayerst Ingram (1855‚Äì1913) ‚Äì also born in Glasgow and also known as a painter of marine subjects. He had helped form the society in 1885: it started under the name the Anglo-Australian Society of Artists. He also played a prominent role in the annual landscape exhibitions of the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours.The Queen, 9 January 1904: Robert W. Allan sends 'nine canvases [sic]'. He maintained his extensive travel itinerary, including a most productive visit to Japan in 1907. Five watercolours from this visit were included in the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours exhibition in November 1907, when it was declared that Yameiman Gate, Nikko was 'fittingly placed as a centrepiece, for its merit justifies this.'Fraserburgh Herald and Northern Counties Advertiser, 19 November 1907. == A late marriage == It would no doubt have been a talking point among his colleagues and friends that in January 1911,The Sun (NY) of 19 January 1911 says, 'London, Jan. 18. Georgiana, daughter of F. P. Trumbull of Ithaca, N.Y., was married here to-day to Robert Allan.' at the age of 59, Allan married a young American woman, Georgiana Emily Trumbull, aged 27,Her passport application to the American Embassy in London on 22 October 1908 gives Georgiana's date of birth as 2 April 1884, and birthplace as Ithaca, New York State. The 1910 Ithaca census gives her father as Frederick Trumbull, high-school attendance officer, and her mother, Elizabeth, is stated as being Canadian (English), with parents born in Scotland. from Ithaca, New York State. It seems likely that the couple had met while Georgiana was on an extensive cultural tour of Europe between 1907 and 1910.Georgiana Trumbull left America on 4 August 1907 with two women from Ithaca. ‚ÄòMrs. Mary Adsitt, Mrs. Slater and Miss Trumbull are now enjoying a visit in Paris‚Äô ‚Äì Ithaca Daily Journal, 5 December 1907. On 22 October 1908 Georgiana applied to the American Embassy in London for a passport to travel to Turkey via Paris ‚Äì presumably on the Orient Express. Mrs Adsitt returned to the USA earlier than Georgiana, possibly because of illness: theIthaca Daily Journal of 13 September 1909 states that ‚ÄòMrs. Mary A. Adsitt, manager of the Wyckoff Phonographic Institute ‚Ä¶ is recuperating at the Trumbull farm, near Jacksonville.‚Äô Georgiana returned to America in January 1910, initially visiting her brother in Boston ‚Äì Ithaca Daily Journal, 19 January 1910. The Ithaca Daily Journal of 19 January 1910 noted, ‚ÄòShe has been away for about two years and a half and has visited nearly every country on the continent and in England.' She returned to her parents' home, but her plans to become a kindergarten teacher in Ithaca Ithaca, New York, City Directory, 1909. were put aside, and in the following January she married Robert Allan in London and the couple were living at Buckingham Gate. In 1911‚Äì12 Allan embarked on an extensive tour that took in North Africa,Gazetteer for Scotland: Robert Weir Allan.

Given Georgiana's interest in foreign travel, this may been planned as a honeymoon trip. Perhaps preparing the ground for a forthcoming visit to his new in-laws, an illustrated article on Robert Allan‚Äôs paintings, with an accompanying specially commissioned portrait of the artist, appeared in the Christian Science Monitor, published in Boston, in early 1913.'Distinction and Wide Variety in Robert Weir Allan's Paintings', Christian Science Monitor, 4 January 1913. Boston was the site of the mother church of the Christian Science movement, and an article by Caroline Fraser in The Guardian of 6 August 2019 states that 1911 saw the peak of the movement in London. It is possible that Georgiana's brother, who lived in Boston, had connections with the Christian Science Monitor and had somehow facilitated the article's publication. Later in Britain there were one-man shows of his work in Glasgow and Birmingham.At J. B. Bennett & Sons, Glasgow (Dundee Courier, 21 November 1913), and at the Graves Gallery Birmingham (Birmingham Daily Post, 13 June 1914). Despite the outbreak of the First World War, a visit to America ‚Äì presumably to visit Georgiana's family ‚Äì went ahead. Records show Robert and Georgiana Allan returning from New York to Liverpool on the Cunard luxury liner RMS Lusitania on 6 March 1915. This would be its last completed return journey to the UK, as it was sunk by a German U-boat on 7 May 1915.Ancestry.co.uk, passenger lists. == The inter-war years == North-Eastern Gale, oil painting, date unknown After the war, paintings evidence visits to France, Holland, Italy and Greece,The Acropolis, Athens (oil), 1919 Royal Academy. and there were further visits to the USA. The Syracuse Journal of 1 November 1920 notes that 'Robert Weir Allan, the eminent British artist, is spending a few days in the city at the home of [Georgiana's brother] Charles D. Trumbull. Mr. Allan and his wife have been in this country for some months visiting the West and are about to return to their home in London, England.' Allan continued exhibiting at the Royal Academy throughout the 1920s and even in the 1930s when in his eighties. The pictures shown were largely coastal views of the Aberdeenshire area that he knew so well, and it seems less likely that he would have been working plein-air. One of his most powerful later oil paintings, North-Easter Gale, effectively reduces the composition to sea and sky. The only record of a portrait painting by Allan is a self-portrait presented by the artist in 1935 to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh. The last work Allan exhibited at the RA was in 1935; it had a characteristic and fitting title ‚Äì Home from the Sea. Although passenger lists show the Allans travelling together as a couple as late as 1929,Ancestry.co.uk, passenger lists New York‚ÄìSouthampton, 23 January 1929. by the mid-1930s the couple seem to have separated.

She was still in London the following year, when she attended a garden party in St James's Square held by the Royal Institute of International Affairs.The Times, 26 May 1937. It is possible that her presence in London then was required for a pending divorce,There seems to be no online record of the Allans' divorce, although 1937 saw a relaxing of UK divorce laws with the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937 making unlawful desertion for two years or more, cruelty, and incurable insanity all grounds upon which a divorce could be granted. as on 11 August 1941 she remarried in Maine, USA, under her maiden name, Georgiana Trumbull.Ancestry.com, Maine, Marriage Index, 1892‚Äì1996.

Healthcare workers are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection than the general population due to frequent contact with infected individuals. Healthcare workers have been required to work under stressful conditions without proper protective equipment, and make difficult decisions involving ethical implications. Health and social systems across the globe are struggling to cope. The situation is especially challenging in humanitarian, fragile and low-income country contexts, where health and social systems are already weak. Services to provide sexual and reproductive health care risk being sidelined, which will lead to higher maternal mortality and morbidity. ==Risk of infection== The World Health Organization reported that one in ten health workers is infected with coronavirus in some countries. In March 2020, 9% of those affected with COVID-19 in Italy were health workers. In May 2020, the International Council of Nurses reported that at least 90,000 healthcare workers have been infected and more than 260 nurses had died in the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, one in four doctors in the UK were off sick, in isolation or caring for a family member with COVID-19. The UK government announced that retired healthcare professionals would be brought out of retirement to help during the COVID-19 crisis. This led to concerns that they could be at a higher risk for severe COVID-19 illness. ===Shortage of PPEs=== Shortcomings of personal protective equipment have been reported from several countries. In China, inadequate staff training, shortage of PPEs, reduced understanding of PPE use and confused PPE guidance have resulted in infections and deaths among healthcare workers. ===Deaths=== Nurse and doctor deaths due to COVID-19 have been reported from several countries. In May 2020, they added that at least 260 nurses have died due to COVID-19. In March 2020, at least 50 doctors were reported to have died in Italy due to COVID-19. On 8 August 2020, the Indian Medical Association announced that 198 doctors have died in India due to COVID-19. ==Psychological impact== A study from Singapore showed that healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 reported anxiety, depression and stress. Increasing work demands on healthcare professionals conflict with their duties to family and friends, which causes psychological stress. Healthcare professionals reported being anxious about having to self- isolate, quarantine or becoming ill. For healthcare workers, being quarantined was positively associated with minimising direct contact with patients and not reporting to work. An Italian nurse committed suicide after being traumatized trying to save lives of those with COVID-19. ===Violence against healthcare workers=== Healthcare workers have been subjected to violent crimes, such as assault. Hospitals and governments have had to take stricter measures to ensure the safety of their staff; however, many healthcare workers still face significant risk of physical injury. ===Ethical decisions=== The Conversation reports that healthcare workers will have to face 'moral injury' for making difficult decisions such as moving a patient off the ventilator or refusing an ICU bed due to limited resources. == Impact on female staff == Globally, women make up 70 percent of workers in the health and social sector. Women are playing a disproportionate role in responding to the disease, including as front line healthcare workers (as well as carers at home and community leaders and mobilisers). In some countries, COVID-19 infections among female health workers are twice that of their male counterparts. Women are still paid much less than their male counterparts in almost all countries and hold fewer leadership positions in the health sector. Masks and other protective equipment designed and sized for men leave women at greater risk of exposure.

In partnership with world-class universities and international humanitarian organizations, UniRef offers university courses to refugees and to people from the host community facing financial difficulties. In order to propose a training adapted to the specific living context of the community and in line with the demands from the local labor market, this NGO provides its own courses in cooperation with its partners. == Origins of the Organization == Initially known as Swiss International Humanitarian Organization (SIHO), UniRef was created by Yvelyne and Bryan Wood in 2013, with the aim to support victims of armed conflicts. The first mission of the organization, in Burundi, was named UniRef ‚Äì University for Refugees ‚Äì, and intended to offer access to tertiary education for refugees. The name of the mission remained, becoming the name of the organization. According to UNESCO, the access to education, and particularly to higher education, entails a strategic challenge for the resolution of humanitarian crises. Tertiary education is not only a factor for development but also a crucial agent of integration for young refugees. Indeed, obtaining a diploma constitutes a valuable opportunity for sustainable integration through employment and thereby for inclusion in the host society. This is significantly important given that the dependence on humanitarian aid puts them at risk of being socially excluded, which can then lead to social tensions. Based on the declarations of the CEO/president of UniRef, Yvelyne Wood, during a press conference held in Abu Dhabi at the beginning of May 2018, the UniRef mission will not only enable refugees to get out of precariousness, but also to lift themselves out of the situation of assistance and dependence they find themselves in. UniRef aims to provide the needful means for refugees and the host community to take control of their own future. While there are many programs that promote access to higher education for refugees, only a few focus on the first cycle of tertiary education, rather offering advanced trainings at a master's degree level. As a result, they exclude most of the youngsters in age to pursue higher education. Besides, according to UNESCO, as infrastructures and institutions are planned for a classic academic functioning, not many programs are adapted to the particular conditions of refugees. Additionally, their adaptation will depend on the means of the host country, generally under pressure of a humanitarian crisis context. == The UniRef missions == === Refugee camp in Musasa, Burundi === The first mission based in Burundi intended to deliver a professionalizing formation to high school graduates, nationals from the Republic of the Congo (DRC), in Musasa camp from September 28, 2015, the opening date of the first classes. This transit camp mainly hosts the civil war victims, a war that has raged DRC since 1996, following the Rwandan genocide against the Tutsi. The current vocation of UniRef has been built on this pilot project. The start of the programs had to be postponed due to political disturbances occurred in September at the capital, Bujumbura. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in charge of it, the number of Congolese refugees kept increasing on this transit camp in 2018, even though in 2007 they were already more than 5,500. The Burundian political crisis that sparked in 2015 led to restrictions in 2017.

In these circumstances, UniRef had to withdraw and amend its mission, while 880,000 Congolese citizens had to integrate the country where they found refuge, in Burundi. The Representative Office of the NGO, located in Muyinga has been closed from December 2017. === Humanitarian partnership in Jordan with the Red Cross and Red Crescent Organizations === Starting in September 2020, after two years of implementation, a mission conducted in Jordan will propose university formations for urban Syrian refugees and for the local population. The project will be carried out in partnership with the Jordanian Red Crescent and other affiliated institutions to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). For the President of the Jordanian Red Crescent, higher education does not only enable refugees to contribute to the reconstruction of their country in the coming years, but it also constitutes a security strategy, given that it prevents the youth to get recruited by extremist groups. Whereas the young refugees aged from 15 to 24 were the ones facing the most negative impact from the Syrian crisis, in 2015 they were the most neglected by the international aid. Even if a few initiatives have emerged, the access to higher education is still very limited and consists of lifting the legal and financial obstacles, generally through scholarship programs. Furthermore, according to the UN, the infrastructures and the public academic institutions in Jordan are not adapted to refugees.Ahmad Al-Hawamdeh and Hana A. El-Ghali, The Regional Conference on Higher Education in Crisis Situations:‚ÄúHigher Education in Crisis Situations: Synergizing Policies and Promising Practices to enhance Access, Equity and Quality in the Arab Region‚ÄùHigher Education and Syrian Refugee Students: The Case of Jordan(Policies, Practices, and Perspectives),UNESCO Regional Bureau for Education in the Arab States, Beirut, p.21 Indeed, one of the most important obstacles for higher education is the capacity of planning required to accomplish of a long formation. The refugee population is generally deprived of this capacity. In order to mitigate this deficiency, UniRef has designed these professionalizing university courses, compressed in a shorter duration than the traditional courses, lasting about one year and accessible to the refugees having accomplished their secondary education. The proposed formation will be provided in three fields in order to cater for the increasing needs of the regional labor market. On August 15, 2020, the launch of the project was formalized with the opening pilot classes to 100 Syrian refugees. This preliminary implementation phase is the first of a project which provides for the enrollment of 1,000 students per year for 5 years, to benefit a total of 5,000 young people, mostly Syrians, free of charge. The program is also accessible to Jordanian nationals who do not have access to higher education due to insufficient economic resources in order, according to Dr Fawzi Abdullah Amin, representative of the IFRC engaged alongside UniRef in this project, to provide support to both Syrian refugees living in Jordan and host communities. In a press release taken up by Gulf Today, the president of the Jordanian Red Crescent, Dr Mohamad Al-Hadid, revealed the three areas in which academic teachings would be delivered: IT, agriculture / agribusiness and health, specifying that these training courses have received the approval of the Jordanian ministries of higher education and health. == Connex Articles == * United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) * The UN Refugee agency (UNHCR) * International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) * Syrian refugees in Jordan == Notes and references == ","title":"UniRef"},{"id":"63945308","text":"Doris Emmie Grimes (1 January 1909 - 27 June 1987) was a British diver.

It is a Grade II listed building. ==History== In the early 20th century Beddington and Wallington Urban District Council was based at 37 Manor Road, the former offices of Wallington Parish Council. After rapid population growth in the area, civic leaders decided to procure a purpose-built town hall: the site chosen for the new building was \\"Sunny Bank\\", a house on Woodcote Road, Wallington, which was bought in 1929. The foundation stone for the new building was laid by Mr W. J. Mallinson DL on 12 May 1934. It was designed by Robert Atkinson in the Georgian style, built by Perry (Ealing) Ltd and was officially opened by the Member of Parliament for Mitcham, Sir Richard Meller, on 21 September 1934. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with eleven bays facing onto Woodcote Road; the central section of five bays featured a three-bay porch with fluted pilasters; there was a central window and balcony with wrought-iron railings on the first floor with the borough coat of arms carved by the sculptor, Eric Aumonier, above; there was a copper- clad clock tower with a weather vane at roof level. The clock was designed and manufactured by Gillett & Johnston of Croydon. The landscaping around the building incorporated a garden of remembrance and a flagpole, which was erected in a prominent position in front of the building. The principal room was a double-height council chamber; the interior made extensive use of walnut paneling and the double-flight staircase, which was made from black and white marble, was decorated in an art deco style. Pevsner noted that the \\"romanticism of Sweden and Holland in the 1920s is represented, surprisingly prettily and pleasantly, by Wallington Town Hall\\". The building went on to become the headquarters of the Municipal Borough of Beddington and Wallington when the area became a municipal borough in 1936. It ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged London Borough of Sutton was formed in 1965. After being used as the local registrar's office in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was converted into a courthouse by dividing the council chamber into two courtrooms, one above the other, in 1980. After the courts moved out in April 1999, the building was then converted for educational use and became part of Sutton College in October 2005. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Sutton Category:City and town halls in London Category:Government buildings completed in 1934 Category:Grade II listed government buildings Category:1934 establishments in England ","title":"Wallington Town Hall"},{"id":"63945914","text":"Walter Sidney Abbott (May 21, 1879 ‚Äì October 27, 1942) was an American entomologist who worked at the Bureau of Entomology in Virginia and is best known for Abbott's Formula to calculate insecticide efficiency with a correction involving natural deaths. Abbott was born in Manchester, New Hampshire, and graduated from the University of New Hampshire in 1910, following which he worked at the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station. He joined the Bureau of Entomology in 1912 with the job of enforcing the Insecticide Act of 1910. He worked until his retirement in 1938.

His most significant contribution was the so-called Abbott's Formula that he published in 1925 to calculate the efficiency of insecticides, which subtracts the natural deaths of insects using results from a control plot. Abbott's correction in its basic form is: \\\\text{mortality}\\\\%=\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac {P_t} {P_c}\\\\right)*100 where Pc is the proportion (or numbers) of individuals alive in the control; Pt is the proportion (or numbers) of individuals alive in the treatment (both of which start initially with the same numbers or densities of test organisms).

It elected two members to the Senate of the Philippines, the upper chamber of the bicameral Philippine Legislature under the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands for each of the 4th to 10th legislatures. The district was created under the 1916 Jones Law from the western Visayas provinces of Capiz and Iloilo. Romblon was added in 1917 upon its re-establishment as a regular province separate from Capiz. The district was represented by a total of eight senators throughout its existence. It was abolished in 1935 when a unicameral National Assembly was installed under a new constitution following the passage of the Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act which established the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Since the 1941 elections when the Senate was restored after a constitutional plebiscite, all twenty-four members of the upper house have been elected countrywide at-large.

His officious boss Harvey (Christopher Eccleston) sets him a deadline, forcing Leslie to resort to desperate measures - hanging out at suicide hotspots to try and pick up some extra business... On the wrong side of Chelsea Bridge he meets struggling writer William (Aneurin Barnard) and Leslie offers an unconventional deal - Dead In A Week (or your money back). But with the deal signed William finally finds some sense of security, causing him to question if the deal is what he really wanted. The film had its world premiere at the 2018 Edinburgh International Film Festival, and also screened at the Rome International Film Festival ahead of an exclusive release in Odeon Cinemas UK by Republic Film Distribution. ==Reception== The film was well supported on its release in UK Cinemas, backed by Stephen Fry who became an Executive Producer and The Samaritans. The critical reception was mixed. The Hollywood Reporter praised Tom Wilkinson's depiction of the hitman \\"Although Leslie proves quite ruthless and skilled at his evil profession, the veteran actor manages to make him somehow lovable.\\" Perhaps surprisingly the film had a much wider theatrical release in Italy taking almost $700k at the box office The film was also released by Netflix in 2019. ==Cast== * Tom Wilkinson as Leslie * Aneurin Barnard as William * Freya Mavor as Ellie * Marion Bailey as Penny * Christopher Eccleston as Harvey * Velibor Topic as Ivan * Nigel Lindsay as Brian == References Category:2018 black comedy films Category:2018 films Category:British black comedy films Category:British films Category:English- language films Category:Films set in England ","title":"Dead in a Week or Your Money Back"},{"id":"63946368","text":"Michael Holland Hobbiss (born 17 August 1985) is an English former first-class cricketer.

It is the successor to the Fortschritt E 512, which it did not manage to replace ‚Äì the E 514 was produced alongside the E 512 from 1982 until 1988. The E 514 is based upon the E 512, and thus shares the same basic design with the E 512\\\\. Compared with its predecessor, the E 514 can process more material per second. It also has an improved header drive mechanism, and a bigger corn tank. == Technical description == The Fortschritt E 514 is a conventional straw-walker combine harvester, and has front-wheel drive with a continuously variable transmission. The corn passes through the E 514 in longitudinal fashion. This means that it enters the combine in front, and gets pulled into the mid- mounted threshing drum; the straw exits the machine in back, after getting cleaned in the straw walkers, which are installed in the E 514's rear compartment. The Fortschritt E 514 can be used for several different types of corn; it can be used on slopes with an angle of up to 8.1¬∞. From the factory, headers with cutting widths of 3.6 m (12 ft), 4.2 m (14 ft), and 5.7 m (19 ft) were available. The E 514 can process up to 6 kg of material per second. === Threshing system === The threshing drum and concave are identical to the ones used in the Fortschritt E 512\\\\. The threshing drum has a width of 1278 mm and a diameter of 600 mm. It is equipped with 8 rasp bars. It is driven by a belt, that is hydraulically adjustable in length (CVT), in order to adjust the threshing drum speed. The speed is adjustable between 603 and 1600 min‚àí1. The concave has 14 rasp bars, and its distance from the threshing drum can be quickly adjusted in three steps using a lever in the driver's cabin; fine adjusting is possible by turning the concave adjusting nut with a jaw spanner. The E 514's threshing system has an improved impeller, that does not only move the material from the threshing drum to the straw walkers, but also separates the corn and straw, in order to improve the combine's overall performance. === Straw and corn processing === The combine has four straw walkers, with four steps each. Their total area is 5.2 m2. The remaining straw can be processed in three ways: Placed in swaths on the field, chopped with a straw cutter, or placed on the field in stacks. The latter method is intended for plants with low straw yields. The corn falls out of the threshing drum (and out of the straw walkers) onto the pan, from where it gets onto the sieves. The E 514 has two sieves, the adjustable top sieve (1.85 m2), and the fixed bottom sieve (1.17 m2). The cleaning fan that blows over the sieves is driven with a CVT, its speed can be adjusted from 242 to 775 min‚àí1. === Corn tank === The Fortschritt E 512's biggest design flaw is its corn tank ‚Äì it has a capacity of only 2.3 m3, and is thus too small. With the E 514, Fortschritt attempted to address this problem. Calculations of the corn tank size and ground pressure ratio showed that the best corn tank size would be 3.6 m3; the E 514 was thus fitted with a corn tank of this size, that allowed longer unloading intervals. === Engine === The E 514 is powered by an IFA 4 VD 14,5/12-1 SRW four-stroke diesel engine. This engine is a naturally aspirated, water-cooled pushrod straight-four engine with two crossflow cylinder heads. It has a helix-controlled inline injection pump, and M-System direct injection with central-sphere combustion chambers. With a cylinder bore of 120 mm and a stroke of 145 mm, it displaces 6.56 dm3. It is rated 85 kW at 2000 min‚àí1, and produces a maximum torque of 422 N¬∑m at 1400 min‚àí1. The engine is mated with a dry dual-disc clutch. Compared with the E 512, the E 514 has better engine utilisation, which explains why the engine power output was increased. === Drivetrain === The Fortschritt E 514 has a belt system. From the engine, the torque is sent to the main drive-wheel with a belt, from where all the combine's systems are driven with belts, including the header. The torque for the front wheels is sent through a manual three-speed gearbox, and a belt CVT. The CVT ensures that the E 514's engine can always run at full power regardless of driving speed. By default, the driven front axle has 18.4‚Äì30 12PR tyres. From the factory, crawler tracks with a width of 700 mm and 7 bogie wheels were available instead. On the rear steering axle, the E 514 has 10‚Äì20 8PR tyres. If fitted with crawler tracks, the rear tyres are slightly wider (12.5-20). === Auxiliary systems and assistance systems === The E 514 has hydraulically operated, power-assisted duo-duplex brakes, and a completely power-assisted, hydraulic steering system. In addition to that, Fortschritt offered several assistant systems, such as a steering assisting system (that helps keep the E 514 in a straight line by automatically correcting the steering angle), and a computer, that precisely calculates the corn loss. == References == C.

Deir Al Arba'een (), also Masha'ad Al Arba'een, is a ruined building approximately 300 meters to the West of the Old City of Hebron. It is considered the most notable ancient structure on Tel Rumeida. It was described by the PEF Survey of Palestine in 1874 and by Andreas Evaristus Mader in 1911‚Äì14. A corner of the building contains what is thought to be the Tomb of Jesse and Ruth.Denys Pringle,The Churches of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: A Corpus: Volume 2, L-Z, Cambridge University Press, 1998 pp.203‚Äì204. ==Description== Diagram of Deir Al-Arba'in published by the PEF Survey of Palestine. The ruin, surrounded by a quadrangular wall structure and vaulted rooms, consisted of a single cell chapel and semi-circular apse. The central structure measures 5.5 by 10 metres, surrounded by a quadrangular wall measuring 25 by 30 metres that enclosed vaulted rooms. It is sited above what was formerly known as the 'Ain Khibra, renamed the 'Ain Judaida. The PEF Survey of Palestine described the ruins as follows: \\"The building seems to be a modern Arabic work on older foundations... Several pillar shafts lie in the ruins. The vaults which remain have both groined and tunnel roofs, with pointed arches. Lower down the hill, on the north-east, are three parallel vaults, bearing 109' along this length, ruined on the east ends. They have a sloping outer scarp, and the building measures about 60 feet square outside. The walls are 9 feet thick; the vaults have timnel roofs. The masonry resembles that of the Deir ‚Äî stones rudely squared, 2 feet by if feet by 1^ feet high, or 10 inches by 13 inches high. Some stones lie near having rude drafts.\\" The Sakawati vaults are 8 feet by 4 feet, and 32 feet high. ==History== It was described by Mujir al-Din, in his History of Jerusalem and Hebron (c.1495) as a pilgrimage site visited by pious Muslims (ziyƒÅrah).Moshe Sharon, Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum Palaestinae, Vol 5, H-I BRILL, 2013 pp.45‚Äì52. This site began to be called Deir al-Arba'een (Mosque of the Forty [Witnesses]) by the 19th century.Lior Lehrs, 'Political holiness: negotiating holy places in Eretz Israel/Palestine, 1937‚Äì2003,' in Marshall J. Breger, Yitzhak Reiter, Leonard Hammer (eds.),Sacred Space in Israel and Palestine: Religion and Politics, Routledge, 2013 pp.228‚Äì249 p.242. According to Moshe Sharon, both names, Mashhad al-Arba‚Äôin and Dayr al-Arba‚Äôin, appear to reflect the ancient name for Hebron, Qiryat Arba‚Äô, and thus would not refer to forty martyrs. Juan Perera, a Franciscan writing c.1553, described what was known in the Christian tradition as the Church of the Forty Martyrs, (Ecclesia quadraginta martyrum), which had been transformed into a mosque,Juan Perera, A Spanish Franciscan's Narrative of a Journey to the Holy Land, edited by H. C. Luke London, 1927, cited Pringle p.203. and was apparently associated with Cain's murder of Abel. There is no evidence of its use by Christians in the medieval period. Francesco Quaresmi in the early 17th century, described its remains as the chancel of the earlier church, and observed that Turks and Orientals generally held this structure,Claude Reignier Conder, Herbert Kitchener, The Survey of Western Palestine: Memoirs of the Topography, Orography, Hydrography, and Archaeology, Committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund, London, 1883, Vol 3 pp.327‚Äì8.Franciscus Quaresmius, Historica theologica et moralis Terrae Sanctae, 1639, vol 2 p.782. Gotthilf Heinrich von Schubert described the buildings in 1837. Georg Rosen and Arthur Penrhyn Stanley visited the site on their journey to Palestine with the Prince of Wales in the mid-nineteenth century. Rosen wrote that the tradition that a tomb in the building is that of Jesse is \\"very young\\", noting that 17th century traveller Laurent d'Arvieux described it as the tomb of Caleb. Rosen also stated that the tomb does not \\"seem to be particularly revered by the Jews of Hebron\\".Ueber das Thal und die n√§chste Umgegend Hebrons, G. Rosen, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl√§ndischen Gesellschaft, Vol. 12, No. 3 (1858), pp. 477‚Äì513, https://www.jstor.org/stable/43359676: \\"Auf dem Gipfel dieses H√ºgels liegt die nicht unbetr√§chtliche Ruine, welche v. Schubert besucht und beschrieben hat (Ritter, Erdkunde XVI. 1. p.218). Die Rabbinen Hebrons zeigen dieselbe als das Grab Isais; jedoch entging schon dem so eben genannten Reisenden nicht, dass der Hauptbau nichts Anderes als eine kleine Kirche gewesen seyn k√∂nne. Vor 200 Jahren wurde dem Ritter ƒè Arvieux (M√©moires II. p. 236), welcher (wie v. Schubert) sich in Hebron j√ºdischer Gastfreiheit erfreute, dieselbe Ruine als das Grab Calebs gezeig. Die Tradition ist also eine sehr junge; auch scheint die Stelle bei den jetzigen Juden Hebrons nicht in besonderer Verehrung zu stehn. Der arabische Name D√©ir- el-Erba'√Æn (ÿØŸäÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ±ÿ®ÿπŸäŸÜ‚Äé) f√ºhrt uns unwiderleglich auf den wirklichen Ursprung jener Reste, deren Bau √ºbrigens keineswegs ein hohes Alterthum bekundet. Es war, wie auch d'Arvieux (an d. ang. St.) ausspricht, ein den 40 M√§rtyrern gewidmetes Kloster, welches wahrscheinlich noch von andern, jetzt bis zur Unkenntlichkeit zerfallenen Bauten umgeben war.\\" ==Tomb of Jesse and Ruth== These identifications are, according to Moshe Sharon, rather late since they are not mentioned by the Arab medieval writer Mujir al-Din. Rabbi Jacob, the Messenger of Yechiel of Paris, around 1238‚Äì1244, stated that either Jesse or Joab was buried in a cave on this Hebron hillsite.Elkan Nathan Adler, Jewish Travellers in the Middle Ages: 19 Firsthand Accounts, Courier Corporation, 1930 reprint pp.115.129 p.120. The Italian Jewish traveler, Rabbi Meshulam of Volterra, stated that the tomb of Jesse he visited in 1481 was located 10 miles from Hebron.Adler, p.187. In 1522-3 Rabbi Moses ben Mordecai Bassola visited the site, mentioning only Jesse's tomb in a burial cave, putatively, in local folklore, connected by tunnel to the Cave of the Patriarchs.Moses ben Mordecai Basola, 'In Zion and Jerusalem: the itinerary of Rabbi Moses Basola (1521‚Äì1523)', C. G. Foundation Jerusalem Project Publications of the Martin (Szusz) Department of Land of Israel Studies of Bar-Ilan University, 1999 p.77. Quote: \\"at the summit of the mountain opposite Hebron is the burial place of Jesse, David's father. It has a handsome building with a small window that looks down on the burial cave. They say that once they threw a cat through the window and it emerged from the hole in the Cave of the Patriarchs. The distance between them is half a mile.\\" Ruth's tomb only began to be pointed out at the outset of the 19th century. == Sakawati vaults== The Sakawati vaults contain another tomb bearing the inscription of Seiyid el 'Alam el 'Araf el Mehakkik Muhammed Ibn 'Abdallah el Hasany, with a date, 27 Rejeb, 652 AH (1254 C.E.) The PEF Survey of Palestine in 1874 noted that a pottery lamp burnt over the tomb, and it was known to the locals as the tomb of Sheikh el Mujahed or Abu es Sakawati. ==References== Category:Historic sites in the State of Palestine Category:Buildings and structures in Hebron Category:Palestinian architecture ","title":"Deir Al Arba'een"},{"id":"63946439","text":"Clinopodium menthifolium, commonly known as the wood calamint or woodland calamint, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is found throughout southern and central Europe from the United Kingdom and east as far as temperate parts of Asia, and as south as North Africa. It grows up to in elevation. The three subspecies of C. menthifolium have been previously considered separate species, including C. m. subsp. ascendens (syn. C. ascendens), the common calamint or ascending wild basil, and C. m. subsp. hirtum (C. hirtum). ==Taxonomy== The wood calamint was first formally named in 1831 by Nicolaus Thomas Host as Calamintha menthifolia. Three subspecies are accepted: * Clinopodium menthifolium subsp. menthifolium ‚Äì commonly called Calamintha sylvatica * Clinopodium menthifolium subsp. ascendens ‚Äì commonly called Calamintha ascendens * Clinopodium menthifolium subsp. hirtum ‚Äì commonly called Calamintha hirta ==Description== Clinopodium menthifolium subsp. menthifolium is a tufted, hairy, mint-scented perennial herb with an upright habit and few branches. It grows to a height of around . The leaves are dark green, stalked and grow in opposite pairs. The leaf blades are ovate with rounded teeth and are larger than those C. menthifolium subsp. ascendens. The lipped flowers are also larger and darker, with the corolla lobe at least twice as long as the hairy calyx. Clinopodium menthifolium subsp. ascendens grows to about in height. This perennial rhizomatous herbaceous hemicryptophyte plant has stalked leaves and an erect hairy stem with tall flowering spikes. It produces pinkish or bluish flowers with spots on the white lower lip. They bloom from July to September. ==Distribution and habitat== Wood calamint is native to Western Europe and North Africa. Its range extends from France and Germany south to Spain and Algeria, and it also known from Northern Syria. In Britain, it is limited to a single site in the Isle of Wight, where it grows in ancient deciduous woodland on a chalk soil. It has been introduced into the United States where it has become naturalised in California and Virginia. Clinopodium menthifolium subsp. ascendens occurs on dry, calcareous soils in hedges, roadsides, grasslands and rocky grounds. ==Uses== The leaves of wood calamint can be infused to make an aromatic herb tea. They can also be added to cooked foods, imparting a pungent, aromatic flavour that has been described as being a combination of the flavours imparted by marjoram and mint. The plant is also used as an ornamental for garden cultivation, and will attract butterflies and bees. The plant has also been used medicinally, as a diaphoretic and an expectorant, and to settle the stomach. It can be added to cough medicine, often in combination with yarrow (Achillea millefolium) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris). It is also used to treat fever, insomnia and depression. ==References== menthifolium Category:Flora of Europe Category:Flora of North Africa ","title":"Clinopodium menthifolium"},{"id":"63946447","text":"Fawn Krieger (American: b. 8 May 1975) is an interdisciplinary artist who creates discrete sculptures and immersive multi-media environments individually and sometimes in collaboration with other artists and performers, including Neal Medlyn., Tracy + the Plastics, and Anna Oxygen.

This lichen occurs in coastal forests in Thailand, Vietnam, and northeastern Australia, where it grows on tree bark. ==Taxonomy== Kalbionora was circumscribed in 2017 by Mattika Sodamuk, Steven Leavitt, and H. Thorsten Lumbsch to contain a new lichen discovered by Sodamuk in a mangrove forest in eastern Thailand, where it was growing on the bark of Ceriops tagal. The specific epithet refers to the occurrence of the lichen in the paleotropics, while the generic name honours German lichenologist Klaus Kalb. Although Kalbionora is morphologically quite similar to species from the genus Malmidea or Eugeniella, molecular phylogenetic analysis shows that the species is a distinct lineage within the family Malmideaceae. Its standing as a genus has been accepted in recent large-scale updates of fungal classification. ==Description== Kalbionora palaeotropica is a crustose lichen that grows on bark. Its thallus is greenish grey to whitish grey with a continuous surface covered in small wart-like protuberances. A prothallus is not visible, and there are no isidia and soredia.

Four days later Aitana told to the same radio station that the collaboration was going to be released soon as well as another one with Colombian band Piso 21 that will be released throughout the year. On May 10, Aitana announced that she would go live on Instagram with someone the following day in the evening to reveal something special. See so, she contacted with Reik and shared the live-stream in order to announce their newest musical collaboration. Aitana told the audience that the song was recorded in April 2019 and meant to be included in the singer's debut album Spoiler but was somehow discarted in major part because she felt like there was something missing in the track.

The plot centres around an expelled university student from Warsaw who attempts to steer the internet, causing widespread hatred and violence. It premiered on 6 March 2020 in Poland and went on to win the Best International Narrative Feature Award at Tribeca Film Festival. Whilst fictional, the film does relate to ongoing real-life situations such as the use of social media to psychologically manipulate users and navigate public opinion through fake news. It is a representation of how online- propelled hatred can lead to severe consequences and real-life casualties. Three weeks after the filming was completed, Pawe≈Ç Adamowicz, city mayor of Gda≈Ñsk and a liberal politician frequently targeted by online haters, was stabbed to death during a live broadcast charity event. ==Premise== Tomasz Giemza, a disgraced law student obsessed with the progressive, upper-class Krasucki family, takes a job at a public relations company. What seemed like just another assignment turns out to be a quickly developing troll farm, where he excels in the business of spreading fake news and online hatred targeting famous personalities, internet celebrities and politicians. With time, Tomasz begins to use his newly acquired skills in order to stalk, harass and ultimately control the Krasuckis. ==Cast== * Maciej Musia≈Çowski as Tomasz Giemza * Vanessa Aleksander as Gabriela 'Gabi' Krasucka * Agata Kulesza as Beata Santorska * Danuta Stenka as Zofia Krasucka * Jacek Koman as Robert Krasucki * Maciej Stuhr as Pawe≈Ç Rudnicki * Adam Gradowski as Stefan 'Guzek' Guzkowski * Jedrzej Wielecki as Staszek Rydel ==Production== Principal photography began on 28 October 2018 and ended on 22 December. It was primarily filmed in Warsaw and surrounding areas. The Hater is considered a sequel or a spin-off to Komasa's previous film Suicide Room (2011). ===Assassination of Pawe≈Ç Adamowicz=== On 13 January 2019, Pawe≈Ç Adamowicz, the liberal mayor of Gda≈Ñsk in northern Poland, was stabbed in the heart while speaking on stage at the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity event. He was taken to Gda≈Ñsk University Clinical Centre in critical condition, where he underwent five-hour long surgery. He died the following day. The detained killer was a 27-year-old man who was a vehement critic of the liberal and democratic Civic Platform party, of which Adamowicz was a member. The police confirmed he was widely active on social media. The film drew remarkable and unexpected parallels with the attack on Adamowicz. Similarly to the fictional character Rudnicki, Pawe≈Ç Adamowicz was a long-time target of an overwhelming hate speech campaign fueled by politicians deriving from far-right and nationalist circles. ==Release== The Hater was released in Poland on 6 March 2020. However, a few days after its release, cinemas and movie theaters were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was distributed worldwide in streaming by Netflix on 29 July 2020. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 20 reviews with an average rating of 7.36/10. On Metacritic, it holds a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Ola Salwa on Cineuropa stated \\"The Hater is a thrilling tale of an anti-hero and of the survival of the fittest, which in this case means those who have a strong and agile thumb and index finger.\\" Brian Tallerico from RogerEbert.com praised the film's interesting moral narrative. Variety positively reviewed the plot, stating that it \\"effectively integrates concerns about how easily people are manipulated\\". ===Awards=== The Hater premiered at Tribeca Film Festival in the International Narrative Competition and won Best International Narrative Feature award. The jury comprised film professionals among whom were Danny Boyle and William Hurt. ==ReferencesCategory:2020 films Category:2020 drama films Category:2020 thriller films Category:2020s political thriller films Category:2020s thriller drama films Category:Films about social media Category:Films set in Warsaw Category:Films shot in Warsaw Category:Polish films Category:Polish-language films Category:Polish thriller drama films ","title":"The Hater"},{"id":"63947085","text":"Kanchikudicharu Tank ( Kanchikudicharu Ku·∏∑am; ) is an irrigation tank in Eastern Sri Lanka, Ampara district.

It is said to wander around the walls of the city at night and to take a large number of children on his back to abduct them. These children never return from this journey. Lou Drap√© could be a version of the drac legend of Occitania, an evil creature that can assume the shape of a horse. The image of this ghastly horse, a symbol of death, is used to scare children, like the bogeyman or the big bad wolf in other regions of France. It is part of an abundant folklore of evil kidnapper horses, which are often linked to water. == Etymology and terminology == According to Fr√©d√©ric Mistral, drapet or draquet is the name given to a small drac, a small lutin in the Languedoc region. Furthermore, he explains that in Montpellier (fairly close to Aigues-Mortes) drapet can be used to describe a revenant, potentially a ghost ‚Äúdraped‚Äù in a shroud, which could explain the connection ‚Äìand confusion‚Äì between the forms drapet-draquet. However, there exists no direct source to explain the name ‚Äúlou Drap√©‚Äù. == Legend == Painting by Fr√©d√©ric Bazille representing the queens' gates of Aigues-Mortes as they were in the 19th century, at the time of the legend. Like any piece of folklore, the story of Lou Drap√© has been transmitted orally for a long time, however the date of its first appearance remains unknown. === Mentions in the 19th century === ‚ÄúLou Drap√©‚Äù is mentioned in an 1818 text by Jacques-Albin-Simon Collin de Plancy in his book on demonic creatures, the Dictionnaire infernal: The later editions of the Dictionnaire infernal (1844, 1845 and 1846), which contain revisions compared to the first edition, also mention lou Drap√© in the same way. In 1856, Jacques-Paul Migne provides some additional information in his Encyclop√©die th√©ologique, a catholic book co- written with Collin de Plancy: === Mentions in the 20th and 21st centuries === Collin de Plancy's written version of the story is copied in 19th century books and magazines specialising in folklore (the Revue des traditions populaires for instance). The Guide de la Provence myst√©rieuse, published in 1965, says that children at the time were still being threatened with the coming of lou Drap√©. In the 1988 esoteric work Les dossiers de l‚ÄôHistoire myst√©rieuse, lou Drap√© is described as a ghastly big white horse that wanders at night around the walls of Aigues-Mortes, producing a melodious sound with his hooves. As it proceeds, children wake up and leave their houses without a sound. As it passes, lou Drap√© gathers the lost children on its back one after the other and takes them away to the marshes of Grau-du-Roi. The destination of the children taken by lou Drap√© is different depending on the author. Whilst Bernard Sergent talks of dangerous quicksand and swamps where the children drown, others like Catherine Rager and √âdouard Brasey make a connection with the famous film White Mane by evoking a ‚Äúmysterious faraway kingdom‚Äù, or an enchanted land where the children subject to the cruelty of Man can live forever with their horse friend. According to the Soci√©t√© d‚ÄôHistoire et d‚ÄôArch√©ologie d‚ÄôAigues-Mortes, ‚Äúno-one ever knew where it [lou Drap√©] took them [the children] and, in fact, no-one has ever wanted to know.‚Äù The last child to have ridden the horse is said to have freed all the others by screaming ‚ÄúJesus, Mary, great Saint Joseph!!‚Äù and jumping to the ground, which would cause lou Drap√© to disappear. √âdouard Brasey adds in La Petite Encyclop√©die du merveilleux that just like the horse Bayard, lou Drap√© seems to have a back and rump of ordinary size but is able to elongate them. The Soci√©t√© de mythologie fran√ßaise tells of the existence of a popular nursery rhyme sung by the children of Aigues-Mortes: == Origin and symbolism == The drac, assuming the shape of a red donkey, on its way to drown careless children. The particularity of lou Drap√© is that it only attacks vagabond children, which makes it, as Collin de Plancy notices, a symbol of the prevention of mothers‚Äô negligence. Its relationship to the croque-mitaine and the ogre (with which it shares the role of ‚Äúterror of children‚Äù) has been discussed, notably by anthropologist Nicole Belmont. Furthermore, lou Drap√© is specific to the folklore of the town of Aigues-Mortes, where ‚Äúinto marshes flows the terrible Vidourle‚Äù, known for its devastating floods. For Jacques de Biez, it could have symbolised the courage of the horse when it comes to work, for it ‚Äúdoes not care about the work charge. It does its duty.‚Äù === A version of the drac === The exact origins of the Drap√© are not known, but this fantastic horse seems to be one of the many versions of the drac of Occitania, that is to say a demon linked to water and its dangers that often assumes the appearance of a donkey or a horse and evokes the Devil. The Dictionnaire des symboles describes the drac as a ‚Äúbeautiful white horse that takes travellers away to drown them in the Doubs‚Äù, whereas Henri Dontenville speaks of the valley of the Alagnon in the Cantal region, where a river runs ‚Äúserpentine like a snake‚Äù. There, the drac takes up residence, turns into a beautiful white horse and obediently lets children and shepherds ride it before drowning them. === The water and the little people === Japanese folklorists looked at the existing connections between the horse and water creatures to explain the Japanese figure of the kappa. Chiwaki Shinoda underlines how old this association is, which could be explained, according to Kunio Yanagita, by a ritual transformation of the sacrifice of the horse in the liquid element. As early as the Neolithic Age, water genies have been connected to equine beasts. The Dictionnaire des symboles cites a great number of ‚Äúevil horses, accomplices of swirling waters‚Äù, mainly in French-German folklore: blanque jument, Bian cheval, Schimmel Reiter, and the drac. Jean-Michel Doulet notices in his study of changelings that ‚Äúby the water, the silhouettes of the lutin and the horse tend to get mixed up and merge into one single entity whose role is to lead astray, to scare off and to plunge the ones who ride it into any pond or river‚Äù. He cites this Aigues-Mortes legend as one of his examples. According to a study on dwarves in the Middle Ages, the links between lutins and fantastic horses are very close for, in the chansons de geste as well as in the more modern folklore, when the little people take the form of an animal, it most often is that of a horse. Many other horses from French folklore play a similar role in relation to water, as mentioned by elficologist Pierre Dubois in La Grande Encyclop√©die des f√©es. He cites the Guernesey horse, the Albret horse, and the personification of the sea in the shape of a mare in Brittany: most of these ‚Äúfairy-horses‚Äù end up drowning their riders. === The lunar whiteness === The Dictionnaire des symboles lingers on the whiteness of ‚Äúghastly, pale‚Äù horses, ‚Äúnocturnal, lunar, cold and empty‚Äù animals, like a shroud or a ghost, which must not be confused with Uranian animals. Their colour evokes grief, like the white steed of the horseman of the Apocalypse, herald of death. According to later versions of the legend, the ‚Äúlunar‚Äù colour white that the Drap√© shares with other evil horses ‚Äìsuch as the Cheval Mallet‚Äì would be the colour of cursed horses. === The lengthening rump === One of the typical characteristics of lou Drap√© is its rump that can be lengthened to allow a great number of children to ride it. It is found in other fairy-horses like Bayard and the blanque jument of the Pas-de-Calais region. According to Henri Dontenville, this characteristic is serpentine, or at least reptilian. In fact, ‚Äúone only has to look at a snake unrolling or, more simply, a worm to understand the origins of this myth‚Äù. In a collection of tales by Jean-Fran√ßois Blad√©, Pierre Lafforgue reports that a steed carrying three riders and possessing the ability to lengthen its rump is a Cheval Mallet, a form of the Devil which can only be fought by making a sign of the cross and refusing to ride it. === Similar legends === Legends very close to that of lou Drap√© exist. At the trou du Vivi√®s, three kilometres away from Narbonne, a mythical horse with an extensible rump is known to take a great number of children on its back and carry them away forever. There exists a variant with a donkey in Mas-Cabard√®s. It too can elongate its back to accommodate children. One day it crosses a river carrying a dozen of them and, as it reaches the middle, lets them fall in the water before taking up another form and perching on a nearby rock, laughing at the trick it has just played on them. These two legends are also variants of the drac. == See also == * Kelpie == References == Category:French legendary creatures Category:Mythological horses Category:Camargue ","title":"Drap√© (legend)"},{"id":"63947142","text":"Maurice Gwynn was a Welsh Anglican priest in the 17th century.\\"An History of the Mitred Parliamentary Abbies, and Conventual Cathedral Churches\\" Bowyer, W. p343: London; Robert Gosling; 1719 Gwynn was educated at University College, Oxford.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Gilpin-Greenhaugh He held livings at Trawsfynydd, Llanfwrog and Llantrissaint.

Through a chance meeting with a former teammate who went on to play for Robert Morris Illinois (which shared Edge with the Steel), Williams wound up enrolling at RMU and practicing with the team during the 2012‚Äì13 season. She then joined the Eagles' full roster for 2013‚Äì14, marking an official return to college hockey after a three-and-a-half year absence. Williams immediately found chemistry with one of the Eagles' established stars, Ramey Weaver. The pair would go on to form two-thirds of the ACHA's best line, as each earned a spot on the ACHA's first All-American team and the duo finished 1-2 among the national scoring leaders. Williams scored 34 goals and 73 points that season in route to winning the Zo√´ M. Harris Award as the ACHA's player of the year. Weaver, who wound up her career after 2013‚Äì14 as Robert Morris' all-time leading scorer, added 32 goals and 55 points. The Eagles largely breezed through their regular season schedule. With Williams putting up nine games with four points or more (including one late-season stretch where she accomplished the feat four times in five games), and delivering late winning goals against Colorado State and Adrian on two of the few occasions RMU was seriously challenged. The Eagles were 22‚Äì5‚Äì4 during the regular season, good for second in the Central Collegiate Women's Hockey Association to Miami, and were ranked third or fourth in the ACHA throughout the entire year. Things abruptly turned south at playoff time however, as RMU was eliminated in the pool round at both the CCWHA playoffs and the ACHA National Tournament. Williams, for her part, was named first team all-tournament at both events after posting 12 points in six games between the two. Miami (2014‚Äì15) Williams transferred to Miami University in Oxford, Ohio for the 2014‚Äì15 season, adding even more firepower to a RedHawks team that had quickly risen to prominence to win both the CCWHA and ACHA titles in 2013‚Äì14. With Miami, Williams largely picked up where she left off the year before, putting up 15 points in her first four games of the season as the RedHawks routed Lindenwood‚ÄìBelleville and Midland. She got even better in November as the games got tougher, taking home the ACHA's Harrow Player of the Month award by scoring seven goals as Miami defeated a string of top teams including UMass (in a rematch of the 2014 national championship game), Adrian, Minnesota, and Liberty. Williams then burned her old RMU team for a goal in each game of a sweep in December, and delivered a two-goal, two assist effort in a 7‚Äì4 win over Rhode Island. The RedHawks were the wire-to- wire number one team and only lost twice during the regular season, a January defeat at home to Penn State (Miami's first loss in more than one calendar year) and another the next month against Michigan State, although Williams and four other key RedHawks missed the latter contest while at the 2015 Winter Universiade tournament in Spain. The quintet then returned for the CCWHA playoffs, in time to help the team win a second consecutive league title with a 4‚Äì2 win over Michigan, with Williams contributing a goal and an assist in the championship game. During most of the ACHA National Tournament at York City Ice Arena in York, Pennsylvania, Miami looked like a safe bet to repeat its 2014 title. Despite a tie with Adrian, the RedHawks won Group B with wins over Minnesota and Michigan, then had little issue with Grand Valley State in a crossover semifinal. In the final however, Liberty scored three goals during one 64-second first-period stretch, outweighing Williams' second-period goal as the Flames won their first national championship by a 4‚Äì1 count. Despite the setback, and for the second straight year, Williams conducted a clean sweep of the major national honors. She was once again voted as the Zo√´ M. Harris Award winner after a combined total of 59 points, becoming just the second player at the Division 1 level to earn the award twice (another player has accomplished the feat since), while also winning first team all-season and all-tournament honors for both the ACHA and CCWHA. Williams went on to complete her Bachelor of Science degree from Miami in Kinesiology, through the Sport Leadership and Management program with a Coaching concentration, in 2016 while playing professional hockey. ===International=== Winter Universiade Williams was selected as a member of the United States National University Team, which competes at the Winter Universiade, during both of her ACHA seasons, and also named an alternate captain each time.http://www.usawomenshockey.com/news_article/show/456032?referrer_id=1362963 The 2013 edition of the tournament, played in Trentino, Italy resulted in a bronze medal for Williams and Team USA after a third-place game win over Japan - the first-ever podium finish for an American women's team at the event and the first for the U.S. men or women in USA Hockey's modern era of participation (since 2001). Williams' contributions to the success were significant ‚Äì she assisted on a late clinching goal by Katie Augustine in the team's biggest win, a 4‚Äì2 victory over a Russia team featuring several Russia women's national ice hockey team members to open the tournament. In the bronze medal match against Japan, Williams again assisted Augustine for the go-ahead goal early in the third period, then scored in the waning moments of the 3‚Äì1 victory. Although the 2015 version of the team was unable to follow up that success and was quickly knocked out of contention at the 2015 tournament in Granada, Spain, Williams did provide one of the squad's signature moments. During a match against Kazakhstan in the 5th through 7th place consolation round robin, Team USA found itself trailing 2‚Äì1 in the last three minutes of the game. Williams then scooped up a loose puck near center ice, carried in herself and scored from the bottom of the left circle with 2:37 remaining. The U.S. went on to win in overtime, a result that eventually allowed the team to finish fifth. Williams scored a pair of goals and added four assists to tie for the team scoring lead. ===Professional=== NWHL (2015‚Äì16) After learning of the launch of the National Women's Hockey League, a new women's professional circuit, Williams attended free agent camps during the summer of 2015 ahead of the NWHL's inaugural season, eventually earning a contract with the Buffalo Beauts. By signing, she became the first former ACHA player to sign in the league (along with UMass alumna Paige Harrington, whose signing with the Beauts was announced at the same time), and the first in any North American women's professional league since the 2002‚Äì03 season. Williams scored her first NWHL goal on November 22, 2015, burying to tie a game against the Connecticut Whale at 6‚Äì6 with 3:23 remaining in the second period, although the Whale would go on to win in a shootout. She added four assists while playing in 17 of the Beauts' 18 regular season games. A fan vote determined the last four participants in the 1st NWHL All-Star Game on January 24, 2016, and Williams was added to Team Knight (captained by United States women's national ice hockey team and then-Boston Pride player Hilary Knight) after receiving 6,384 votes. She went on to score Team Knight's only goal of the game in a blowout loss to Emily Pfalzer's Team Pfalzer. The 2015‚Äì16 Buffalo Beauts season, saw a third-place finish in the standings with a 5‚Äì9‚Äì4 record, and an appearance in the first-ever Isobel Cup Final after rallying to upset Connecticut in a best-of-three semifinal. However, the Beauts dropped the championship series to Boston. CWHL (2016‚Äì18) After only being offered a \\"practice player\\" spot by the Beauts for the 2016‚Äì17 season (practice players are members of the team, but not permitted to play in games unless the team is otherwise shorthanded), Williams crossed over to the Canadian Women's Hockey League and earned a roster spot with the Brampton Thunder through a tryout. She played in 14 games for Brampton, helping the team to a 12‚Äì10‚Äì1‚Äì1 (W‚ÄìL‚ÄìOTL‚ÄìSOL) record and a third-place finish, although they were quickly eliminated in the best-of-three semifinals by Les Canadiennes de Montr√©al. The following season, the Thunder relocated to Markham, Ontario, which is located on the opposite side of Toronto from Brampton. Williams, who still lived in Buffalo dating to her time with the Beauts, negotiated a trade to the Toronto Furies (which played at the Mastercard Centre For Hockey Excellence in Toronto's western neighborhoods, a bit closer to Buffalo than Markham) and spent 2017‚Äì18 with the Thunder's archrival. Playing frequently with Jenna Dingeldein, Jess Vella, and Carolyne Prevost, Williams rediscovered her offensive touch with the Furies, finishing the year fourth on the team in scoring with 14 points. She scored her first CWHL goal on November 11, 2017 to help Toronto beat the Calgary Inferno in a shootout. The next month, she assisted on Jessica Platt's first career goal on December 7, then was named the Furies' player for the game for a two-assist effort in a loss to Calgary ten days later. Late-season highlights included a Furies sweep of the perennially-contending Inferno on January 27 and 28 by 3‚Äì2 and 5‚Äì2 scores, with Williams scoring the winning goal in the first game on a 5-on-3 advantage with 3:21 remaining. She also capped off the weekend by scoring an empty-net goal to seal victory in the second game, in front of a national television audience on Sportsnet. Despite those individual successes, the Furies uncharacteristically struggled throughout most the season, missing the playoffs with a 9‚Äì17‚Äì1‚Äì1 record and a sixth-place finish. ZhHL (2018‚Äì20) Along with former Beauts teammate Tatiana Rafter, Williams jumped to the other side of the globe for the 2018‚Äì19 season as an import player in the Russian Women's Hockey League (abbreviated as \\"ZhHL\\" due to the romanized Russian name Zhenskaya Hokkeynaya Liga) for SK Gorny, announcing the transaction on Instagram. Williams arrived to find a team in something of a chaotic state. Originally known as Arktik-Universitet and operated in conjunction with Ukhta State Technical University, the organization was in the middle of a complete overhaul that would see it rebrand as SK Gorny for the start of the 2018‚Äì19 season, then relocate from the small industrial city of Ukhta to the major metropolis of Saint Petersburg midway through the campaign. Furthermore, Arktik-Universitet had not been successful on the ice, winning just four times in 24 games during 2017‚Äì18. Thanks to the arrivals of Williams and Rafter, along with a nucleus that included Russia women's national ice hockey team players Fanuza Kadirova and Liana Ganeyeva, Gorny slowly became increasingly competitive within the league, improving to 12 wins in 2018‚Äì19. Williams, for her part, scored her first two Russian goals in a win over Biryusa Krasnoyarsk on October 18, 2018, then added key goals to help the squad defeat perennially-strong HC Tornado and Dinamo Saint Petersburg over the following two weekends. In all, she finished her rookie year in Russia with ten goals, tied for second-most on SK Gorny, while her 19 points ranked 38th across the entire league. Williams' exploits merited a spot in the ZhHL's All-Star Game, played on January 13, 2019 in Nizhnekamsk. With the SK Gorny trio of Williams, Rafter, and Kadirova each scoring a goal in the contest, the West downed the East 4‚Äì2. The following season, both Williams and SK Gorny improved. The team contended for a playoff berth until the end of the year, thanks in part to the addition of Russian national teamer Alexandra Vafina from SKIF Nizhny Novgorod (ultimately finishing fifth, three points behind Biryusa for the final spot), and the player bumped up her stats production to 11 goals (14th in the league) and 22 points (16th). She picked up an assist in arguably SK Gorny's biggest win, a 2‚Äì1 overtime victory against eventual league champion Shenzhen KRS Vanke Rays late in the season, and notched a professional-career-best four points (on two goals and two assists) in a season-opening rout of SKSO Yekaterinburg. Williams participated in her second straight ZhHL All-Star Game on January 12, 2020 in Moscow, although her Team West dropped a 4‚Äì1 decision to Team East. EWHL (2020‚Äìpresent) SK Gorny ran into financial difficulties late in the 2020 offseason, leading to Williams' departure and signing with KMH Budapest of the European Women's Hockey League (EWHL). ==Personal== Williams is the founder of Hockey Worldwide, a hockey training and coaching organization that produces on-ice camps and off-ice training programs. ==Career statistics== ===College and professional=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text- align:center; width:60em;\\" - e0e0e0;\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - e0e0e0;\\" !

The aircraft was developed from the 2004-designed Whisper Aircraft Whisper motorglider. The X350 Generation II is supplied as a kit for amateur construction. The X350 Generation II designation indicates a design top speed goal of , with the larger engine fitted. ==Design and development== The aircraft features a cantilever low-wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit that is wide, under an acrylic plastic articulated lift-up bubble canopy. It has fixed optionally tricycle landing gear or conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. The aircraft is predominately made from vacuum-bagged, post- cured carbon fibre composites, with E-glass used for non-structural parts, including the engine cowling, aircraft fairings, wing and tail tips. The structure is 10% anodized aluminum and cadmium-plated steel, with the landing gear legs made from steel. The design's span wing has an area of and mounts plain flaps and features a cruciform tail. The aircraft's recommended engine power range is and standard engines used include the Lycoming O-320, the Lycoming O-360, the Lycoming IO-390, or the ULPower UL520i four-stroke powerplants. The fuel capacity is in two fuselage tanks, although future production kits will have in a wet wing. The design has a single centre console-mounted side-stick or optional individual centre stick controls. The ailerons are actuated via push rods, while the elevator has push rods to the tailcone and then cables. The rudder is cable-actuated. There is no elevator trim tab system, but it may be included as a future factory option. Evaluation flights indicated neutral longitudinal stability, however, reducing the need for one. The left seat is equipped with toe-brakes. The 51% compliant kit includes a mated fuselage and pre-closed wing structures. The aircraft can be constructed in a two-car garage. Construction time from the supplied kit is estimated by the manufacturer as 500 hours. The design as load factors of +6/-4 g, but is not designed for aerobatics. The instrument panel is made from aluminum. The seats and rudder pedals are independently adjustable. There are optional rear fuselage windows for improved visibility, LED navigation lights and strobe lights on the wing tips and tail. Lightning protection is a factory option. ==Operational history== By May 2020 one example had been registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration. In a 2020 review, Kitplanes writer LeRoy Cook stated, \\"the Whisper is a sharp-looking side-by- side two-seater, particularly when perched on tailwheel landing gear. Tricycle gear will probably be a popular option, out of necessity for tamer handling and greater tolerance of gusty winds.\\" Cook noted from his evaluation flight, \\"from my brief sampling, I‚Äôd like to see a little more cockpit ventilation, more foot room after the wing fuel system is installed, and enhanced stability with an elevator trim system. I‚Äôd also like to revisit it with tricycle gear.\\" He concluded, \\"there‚Äôs a lot to like about the Whisper X350 Gen II: its sleek looks, the blazing cruise speed, a roomy cockpit, and an apparent ease of assembly.\\" ==Specifications (X350 Gen II) == ==References== ==External links== * Category:Homebuilt aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Low-wing aircraft Category:2010s South African sport aircraft ","title":"Whisper X350 Generation II"},{"id":"63947516","text":"Emily Miller (March 10, 1871 ‚Äì March 10, 1962) was a nurse and police officer. ==Early Life== Emily Miller was born in Govan.

It celebrates the military and secular culture and traditions of Belarus. It is dedicated to the reconstruction of the Battle of Grunwald between the forces of the Teutonic Order and allies the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (including modern Belarus) and the Kingdom of Poland. The festival has been taking place since 2008 and brings together the country's best knight clubs in Minsk, who then take part in the theatrical reconstruction of the battle. In addition, the festival features medieval tournaments, performances by folk, rock, and metal bands, medieval food, crafts, and costumes. Among the festival's organizers are the Berserk Extreme Theater and Alexander Rak. On average, about 500 representatives of the military-historical reenactment clubs from Belarus, Russia and other European countries take part in the festival. == Festival details == Our Grunwald combines three festivals in one: a military- historical re-enactment, a music festival and a festival of medieval costume. The time frame that has to be respected for the re-enactment, is 1170 - 1520. The festival reconstructs the corresponding time period for large parts of Western Europe, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Kingdom of Poland and the Baltics, and each participant is judged by a special commission to see if they comply with the era. For example, they have to send a photograph of the costumes to the commission. During two festival days, there are knightly tournaments on foot, battles between archers, halberdiers and spearmen, full- contact mass battles (buhurts), a \\"Battle of the Yards\\" tournament, equestrian tournaments and fight demonstrations. The central event is the reconstruction of the Battle of Grunwald, that took place on July 15 1410 at the Prussian town of Grunwald (modern territory of Poland). Our Grunwald is the largest festival in Belarus by the number of participants/re-enactors. In 2019, about 8,000 people attended the festival. In 2015, a so-called ‚Äúfestival within the festival‚Äù was added to \\"Our Grunwald\\": a large-scale open-air concert, called ‚ÄúFeast after the Battle‚Äù, in which famous folk and rock bands of Belarus and foreign countries take part.

The ants live in the hollow branches and shoots, a newly-mated queen having entered through the prostoma, an indented groove at a node in the stem. The ants then protect the tree against leaf-cutting ants and other herbivorous insects. The adult female beetle also chews a hole in the prosoma, a task which may take as long as 24 hours, inserts the tip of her abdomen into the hole and lays a batch of about 65 eggs inside the hollow stem. She then covers these with a glutinous secretion and seals the hole. The eggs hatch after 20 days in June and after 12 days in March. The larvae are gregarious, and have three instar stages. They form chains as they move, and make their way to the underside of leaves to feed; at night they form themselves into circles with their heads in the centre, protected on the outside by their supra-anal shields. When fully developed, they descend to the base of the tree, and pupate in earthen chambers. The adult beetles are toxic, and the ants tolerate their presence on the tree. Another species of ant, Azteca muelleri, also lives on C. pachystachya, and is not so tolerant of the presence of the beetle. It removes C. ruficornis from trees it has colonised, and the larger the ant colony, the more quickly the beetles are located and expelled. ==References== Category:Chrysomelidae Category:Beetles of South America Category:Beetles described in 1865 Category:Taxa named by Joseph Sugar Baly ","title":"Coelomera ruficornis"},{"id":"63947726","text":"Rogue Warfare is a 2019 film directed by Mike Gunther.

Situated on a wide meadow in the upper reaches of Woodfords Canyon alongside the West Fork of the Carson River, the resort consists of a cluster of more than 30 wooden cabins of various sizes and configurations. Founded in 1916, the resort is open year-round. ==History== The resort was founded by Martin Sorensen, who immigrated to the United States from Denmark as an 18-year-old in 1890 and found work as a sheep herder in the Carson Valley. By 1905, he had established his own sheepherding enterprise. In 1916, Sorensen and his wife Irene bought a property spanning the area where Hope Valley narrows to form Woodfords Canyon. Starting out as a humble campsite, Sorensen soon began to expand the resort, and by the end of the 1920s the property boasted ten rustic cabins that rented for 75 cents a night. thumb In 1970 the Sorensen family sold the resort, along with an additional property, to Swedish immigrant Johan Viking Hultin. As a physician with a practice in Los Gatos, Hultin was an absentee owner, living full-time in his Los Gatos home nearly away by road. Hultin hired a series of property managers who proved to be unscrupulous and the resort began a sustained decline, becoming infamous in the area for drug use as damage to the cabins accumulated. However, Sorensen's Resort continued to attract some good press, including a mention in National Geographic magazine. Hultin was an avid cross- country skier who had initially bought the resort with dreams of establishing a large cross-country ski area that would take advantage of the wide-open bottomlands of Hope Valley. This resort did not come to fruition, but under Hultin's ownership, the resort operated the Viggo Nordic cross-country ski school, believed to be the first such school in California. Hultin's last property managers were much more responsible than those who had come before them, and the resort's fortunes began to turn once again as they began renovating the property and repairing the damage that had accumulated over the years. In 1982, John and Patty Brissenden bought the resort property from Hultin for $410,000. Two years later they moved onto the property, where they would live full-time for the rest of their ownership tenure. The Brissendens continued building up the property, including the addition of the large and luxurious Norway House cabin. Hultin had started the cabin's construction, but it had been poorly planned and did not meet building codes until the Brissendens opened it to the public in 1984. The couple also worked to improve the restaurant, which eventually developed a \\"world-class wine list\\". In 2019, the Brissendens retired after nearly four decades of ownership, and sold the resort to a new owner. ==Facilities== The resort property is located just off California State Route 88, about a mile east of its junction with State Route 89. The cabins that make up the resort are scattered amidst evergreens and aspens, backing up to the West Fork of the Carson River. In addition to its lodging facilities, the resort provides hosting for weddings and is home to Sorensen's Country Cafe, one of only two restaurants in the sparsely inhabited Hope Valley area. ==References== ==External links== *Sorensen's Resort Category:Buildings and structures in Alpine County, California Category:Companies based in Alpine County, California Category:Tourist attractions in Alpine County, California ","title":"Sorensen's Resort"},{"id":"63947863","text":"Freek Schutten (29 July 1942 in Coevorden ‚Äì 12 March 2020 in Zwolle) was a Dutch footballer who played, preferably, as a midfielder.

Turner II, Christian R. Nichol, and G. Richard Scott. The ASUDAS gives detailed descriptions for common crown and root shape variants and their different degrees of expression. It also comprises a set of reference plaques illustrating dental variants as well as showing their expression levels in 3D. The ASUDAS was designed to ensure a standardized scoring procedure with minimum error in order to warrant comparability between data collected by different observers. The ASUDAS currently comprises a set of 42 dental variants that can be observed in the permanent adult dentition. The majority are crown and root shape variants, although the system also includes some skeletal variants of the maxilla and mandible. Most of the variants occur at different frequencies in human populations around the world. Examples of dental variants listed in the ASUDAS are shovel-shaped incisors, Carabelli cusps, or hypocones. == Genetics == It is hypothesized that most of the dental variants listed in the ASUDAS are heritable and selectively neutral and that the worldwide dental diversity was generated by random evolutionary processes consisting of founder effects and genetic drift. Several studies have also demonstrated that genetic distances across modern human populations derived from neutrally evolving SNPs or microsatellites are highly correlated with distances derived from dental variants listed in the ASUDAS. Additionally, dental variation within populations decreases with increasing geographical distance from Africa, a signature also found in neutral genetic datasets as a result of a serial founder effect originating in Africa. Some dental variants listed in the ASUDAS are also likely to be associated with non-neutral evolutionary processes, such as natural selection. For example, shoveling and double-shoveling of upper first incisors and the presence of hypoconulids of lower second molars have been found to be linked to the ectodysplasin A receptor gene (EDAR). EDAR is a functional genomic region and has a range of pleiotropic effects on ectodermally derived structures, such as hair, mammary glands, and teeth, and is most likely under positive selection in Asian populations. It is possible that dental variants linked to EDAR are not direct targets of positive selection but rather 'hitchhiking' when selection acts on another phenotype. == Applications == The enamel which covers a tooth crown is the hardest tissue in the human body and generally well preserved in taphonomic contexts, even when associated skeletal and DNA preservation is relatively poor. Therefore, dental morphological data collected with the ASUDAS are commonly used for inferring the biogeographical origin of deceased humans when no other biological markers are available. For example, ASUDAS data are typically used for identifying unknown individuals in forensic cases, for examining past migration and mobility in bioarchaeological contexts, and for reconstructing hominin phylogenies in paleoanthropological studies. As a rule of thumb, dental inferences about neutral genetic affinities based on many ASUDAS variants are more reliable than those based on only a few variants. Nevertheless, the best performance is achieved when using specific combinations of highly diagnostic variants, and not the full ASUDAS set. == References == Category:Teeth Category:Human migration Category:Biological anthropology ","title":"ASUDAS"},{"id":"63948016","text":"Actualite.cd is a Congolese media website specializing in political, security and economic information.

Dimitrije and his people from Lepenice were on the other side of Rogot, towards Brzan. There he set up an ambush to wait for the Turks, regardless of whether they were fleeing from Batocina, or running to this place from Jagodina. The Serbs continued their onslaught until dark, but the Arbanassis did not give in. After besieging Batocina, Karadorde went to Levac to start an uprising in that part of Serbia as well. Kuƒçuk Alija found out that Karaƒëorƒëe had left, so he sent Tosun Aga with five hundred Turkish horsemen to break through to Batoƒçina at night. After taking up positions, a new insurgent attack began on 7 April (26 March by the Old Style calendar). The Turks and Arbanassi decided to retreat towards Jagodina, where they were to meet with Kuƒçuk-Alija and continue further towards Belgrade. However, on the way to Jagodina, insurgents led by Dimitrije Parezan and ƒêuka Filipoviƒá were waiting for them in the Rogot forest, so the Turks decided to look for a way out towards Kijev through the Kijev stream. Karadjordje waited for them to move as far away from Batocina as possible, so he followed them and caught up with them on Kijevaƒçki Potok between Kijevo and Dobrovodica. About four hundred Turks fell dead in that clash. Musein Ganiƒá and Jusuf-aga Klimentiƒá were also killed in the battle, while Tosun aga barely escaped and fled to Jagodina.

However, when he came near Ivanjica, a new order followed to head to Novi Pazar instead. They came to the Studenica monastery. There they stopped to pray, rest a bit, and then head to the river Ibar. They found little resistance from Turkish units. Though, a larger detachment of Turks was waiting for Dimitrije Parezan's unit in front of Novi Pazar where the real battle took place. The Turkish onslaught was heavy and the death toll in numbers for both sides was high. The Serbs were, however, able to stop the Turkish advance because Dimitrije ordered an assault and the people of Lepenica obeyed and set out immediately to meet the Turks. Heavy fighting ensued, and Dimitrije in the midst of close combat could not avoid being struck with an enemy sword.

Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, was inside the apartment with her when the officers knocked on the door and then forced entry. Officers said that they announced themselves as police before forcing entry, but Walker said he did not hear any announcement, thought the officers were intruders, and fired a warning shot at them. According to officials, it hit Mattingly in the leg, and the officers fired 32 shots in return. Walker was unhurt but Taylor was hit by six bullets and died. According to police, Taylor's home was never searched. On June 23, 2020, the LMPD fired Hankison for blindly firing through the covered patio door and window of Taylor's apartment. On September 15, the city of Louisville agreed to pay Taylor's family $12 million and reform police practices. On September 23, a state grand jury indicted Hankison on three counts of wanton endangerment for endangering Taylor's neighbors with his shots. None of the officers involved in the raid has been charged in Taylor's death. Cosgrove was determined to have fired the fatal shot that killed Taylor. On October 2, 2020, recordings from the grand jury investigation into the shooting were released. The shooting of Taylor by white police officers led to protests that added to those across the United States against police brutality, racism, and disparate racial outcomes in the United States criminal justice system. When a grand jury did not indict the officers for her death, further civil unrest ensued. == Persons involved == Breonna Taylor at a graduation ceremony in Louisville, Kentucky *Breonna Taylor worked for University of Louisville Health as a full-time ER technician and was a former emergency medical technician. Her funeral was on March 21, 2020. *Kenneth Walker was Taylor's boyfriend, who was present with her in the apartment at the time. *Jonathan Mattingly is an LMPD police officer who joined the department in 2000, became a sergeant in 2009, and joined the narcotics division in 2016. *Brett Hankison was an LMPD detective. Hankison joined the department in 2003. The LMPD fired him on June 23, 2020. *Myles Cosgrove is an LMPD police officer who was transferred to the department's narcotics division in 2016. == Incident == === Background === The LMPD investigation's primary targets were Jamarcus Glover and Adrian Walker (not related to Kenneth Walker), who were suspected of selling controlled substances from a drug house approximately away. Glover and Taylor had been in an on-off relationship that started in 2016 and lasted until February 2020, when Taylor committed to Kenneth Walker. In December 2016, Fernandez Bowman was found dead in a car rented by Taylor and used by Glover. He had been shot eight times. Glover had used Taylor's address and phone number for various purposes, including bank statements. In various recorded jailhouse conversations in January 2020, Glover said that Taylor had been handling his money. However, in phone calls made after Taylor's death, Glover has also repeatedly claimed that she was not involved in any drug operations, and he has made conflicting statements about having left money with her. In a jail phone call made after the raid by one of Glover's co- defendants, he said \\"the money is in [Taylor's] name\\". === Warrant === LMPD obtained a \\"no-knock\\" search warrant for Taylor's apartment at 3003 Springfield Drive in Louisville. The search warrant included Taylor's residence because it was suspected that Glover received packages containing drugs there, might have been \\"keeping narcotics and/or proceeds from the sale of narcotics\\" there, and because a car registered to Taylor had been seen parked in front of Glover's house several times. Specifically, the warrant alleges that in January 2020, Glover left Taylor's apartment with an unknown package, presumed to contain drugs, and took it to a known drug apartment soon afterward. The warrant states that this event was verified \\"through a US Postal Inspector\\". In May 2020, the U.S. postal inspector in Louisville publicly announced that the collaboration with law enforcement had never actually occurred. The postal office said it was actually asked by a different agency to monitor packages going to Taylor's apartment, but after doing so, it concluded, \\"There's no packages of interest going there.\\" This public revelation put the investigation and especially the warrant into question and resulted in an internal investigation. The warrant was applied for by LMPD detective Joshua C. Jaynes among a total of five warrants approved the preceding day by Jefferson County Circuit Judge Mary M. Shaw \\"within 12 minutes\\", and which was stamped as filed with the court clerk's office on April 2. All five warrants contain similar language involving a justification for no-knock entry that concludes with \\"due to the nature of how these drug traffickers operate.\\" Christopher Slobogin, director of Vanderbilt University's Criminal Justice Program, said that unless police had a reason to suspect that Taylor's residence had surveillance cameras \\"a no-knock warrant would be improper.\\" Brian Gallini, a professor at the University of Arkansas, also expressed skepticism about the warrant, writing that if it was appropriate in this particular search, \\"then every routine drug transaction would justify grounds for no-knock.\\" Detective Jaynes attested in the affidavit that, But Sergeant Timothy Salyer, supervisor of the Shively, Kentucky, police department's Special Investigations Unit, told LMPD internal investigators in May that due to \\"bad blood\\" between the United States Postal Inspection Service () and the LMPD, inquiries related to the drug trafficking investigation had been routed through the Shively . In his interview with internal investigators, Jaynes said that before the raid on Taylor's apartment Mattingly told him that the Shively PD had reported that the United States Postal Service had not delivered any suspicious packages to that address. Jaynes was reassigned from his duties with the LMPD in June. According to The New York Times, before the execution of the no-knock warrant, orders were changed to \\"knock and announce.\\" (From the Internet Archive index for the page, compare captures for August 30, 2020 and September 2, 2020 to see the change in coverage concerning the warrant.) === Police entry into the apartment === Shortly after midnight on March 13, 2020, Louisville police dressed in plain clothes knocked on Taylor's door before forcing entry using a battering ram. There is dispute as to whether the officers announced themselves before forcing entry. Walker contends that Taylor asked, \\"Who is it?\\" several times after hearing a loud bang at the door, and‚Äîhaving heard no answer‚Äîthat he then armed himself. The police officers involved have testified that they announced themselves multiple times before using the battering ram to enter the apartment. The New York Times interviewed roughly a dozen neighbors and alleged that only one of them, who was on the exterior staircase immediately above Taylor's apartment, heard the officers shout \\"Police!\\" once and knock at least three times, while approximately 11 other neighbors heard no knock or announcement, including one who was outside smoking a cigarette. According to a statement by Attorney General Daniel Cameron, an independent investigation concluded that the no-knock warrant was indeed served as a knock-and-announce warrant, which was corroborated by one independent witness who was near Taylor's apartment. But on September 30, this witness's lawyer said that police announced themselves \\"only in passing\\" and implied that the witness was quoted out of context or that video was deceptively spliced. According to VICE News, the witness originally said \\"nobody identified themselves\\" when interviewed by police a week after the shooting. But when the police called him two months later, he said he heard, \\"This is the cops.\\" === Shooting and aftermath === Walker says thatbelieving that intruders were breaking into the apartmenthe fired a warning shot in self-defense. According to officials, the shot struck Mattingly in the leg, but Walker's legal team asserts that because forensic photography shows no blood in the part of the apartment where Mattingly says he was shot, because a court-sealed photograph of the single hollow-point bullet from Walker's firearm shows no blood, and because, based on consultations with pathologists, they believe that a hollow- point bullet would have done \\"considerably\\" more damage to Mattingly's thigh, the evidence suggests Mattingly was shot by police officers. A Kentucky State Police ballistics report is inconclusive, saying that \\"due to limited markings of comparative value,\\" the bullet that hit Mattingly and exited his thigh was neither \\"identified nor eliminated as having been fired\\" from Walker's gun. But it was fired from a 9mm pistol like Walker's, whereas all officers were carrying 40-caliber guns. Police then fired 32 rounds into the apartment during two \\"flurries\\" or waves of shots separated by one minute and eight seconds. Mattingly, the only officer who entered the residence, fired six shots. At the same time, Cosgrove fired 16 shots from the doorway area in a matter of seconds. Hankison fired 10 times from outside through a sliding glass door and bedroom window, both of which were covered by blinds or curtains. The officers' shots hit objects in the living room, dining room, kitchen, hallway, bathroom, and both bedrooms. Taylor was struck by five or six bullets in the hallway and pronounced dead at the scene. Cosgrove fired the shot that killed her. Walker was uninjured. According to police grand-jury testimony, the warrant was never executed and Taylor's apartment was not searched for drugs or money after the shooting. More than a month after the shooting, Glover was offered a plea deal if he would testify that Taylor was part of his drug dealing operations. Prosecutors said that that offer was in a draft of the deal but later removed. Glover rejected the deal. == Investigations and legal proceedings == === Autopsy and death certificate === An autopsy was conducted on Taylor, and her cause of death was determined to be homicide. The death certificate also notes that she received five gunshot wounds to the body. The coroner denied The Courier-Journals request for a copy of the autopsy. The newspaper was appealing to the attorney general's office as of July 17, 2020. === Investigations into the three police officers === The police filed an incident report that claimed that Taylor had no injuries and that no forced entry occurred. The police department said that technical errors led to a nearly entirely blank malformed report. Local and state investigation  All three officers involved in the shooting were placed on administrative reassignment pending the outcome of an investigation by the police department's internal Professional Integrity Unit. On May 20, 2020, the investigation's findings were given to Daniel Cameron, Attorney General of Kentucky, to determine whether any officer should be criminally charged. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer also asked the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office to review the findings. In early June, Fischer called for Officer Hankison to be removed from the Louisville Police Merit Board, which reviews appeals from police offices in departmental disciplinary matters. Hankison was one of five members of the board, which consists of three civilians and two police officers selected by the River City Fraternal Order of Police. On June 19, three months after Taylor's killing, Louisville Metro Police interim chief Robert Schroeder sent Hankison a letter notifying him that Schroeder had begun termination proceedings against him. The letter accused Hankison of violating departmental policies on the use of deadly force by \\"wantonly and blindly\\" firing into Taylor's apartment without determining whether any person presented \\"an immediate threat\\" or whether there were \\"any innocent persons present.\\" The letter also cited past disciplinary action taken against Hankison by the department, including for reckless conduct. Hankison was formally fired four days later (June 23); he had ten days (until July 3) to appeal his termination to the Louisville Police Merit Board. That appeal was delayed until the criminal investigation is finished. On September 23, 2020, a state grand jury indicted Hankison on three counts of wanton endangerment for endangering a neighboring white family of three when shots he fired penetrated their apartment. Conviction could include a sentence of up to five years in prison and a fine for each count. Bullets also entered the upstairs apartment of a black family but no charges were filed. Neither Hankison nor the two other officers involved in the raid were indicted for Taylor's death. Cameron initially said at the news conference that he had walked the grand jury through \\"every homicide offense, and also presented all of the information that was available.\\" The Louisville Courier Journal raised questions about whether the grand jury had been allowed to decide whether charges should be pressed against Mattingly and Cosgrove or whether prosecutors decided that the officers acted in self-defense without submitting the issue to the grand jury. Hankison's and Walker's attorneys requested the release of the grand jury transcript and related evidence. On September 28, a grand juror filed a court motion stating that Cameron had mischaracterized the grand-jury proceedings and was \\"using grand jurors as a shield to deflect accountability and responsibility\\" for charging decisions. A judge ordered the release of the grand jury proceedings' recording. A day later, Cameron said that he did not recommend murder charges to the grand jury, but maintained that he presented \\"a thorough and complete case\\". The juror deliberations and prosecutor recommendations were not released, and according the state attorney general's office, were never recorded. Federal investigation The FBI is conducting its own independent investigation, announced by its Louisville field office on May 21. After the state grand jury charges were announced, the FBI stated, \\"FBI Louisville continues its federal investigation into all aspects of the death of Breonna Taylor. This work will continue beyond the state charges announced today.\\" === Neighbor's lawsuit === On May 20, 2020, the occupants of a neighboring apartment filed a lawsuit against Hankison, Cosgrove, and Mattingly. The occupants were a pregnant woman, her child and a man. The lawsuit alleged that the officers fired blindly into their apartment and nearly hit the man's head, shattered a sliding glass door, and hit objects in three rooms and a hallway. === Kenneth Walker === Walker initially faced criminal charges of first-degree assault and attempted murder of a police officer. The LMPD officers said they announced themselves before entering the home and were immediately met with gunfire from Walker. According to their statement, Walker discharged his firearm first, injuring an officer. Walker's lawyer said Walker thought that someone was entering the residence illegally and that Walker acted only in self-defense. A 911 call later released to the public provided a recording of Walker telling the 911 operator, \\"somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend\\". Walker was later released from jail due to coronavirus concerns, which drew criticism from Louisville Metro Police Department Chief Steve Conrad. Judge Olu Stevens released Walker from home incarceration on May 22. Commonwealth's Attorney Tom Wine then moved to dismiss all charges against Walker in late May. The case could be presented to a grand jury again after reviewing the results of the FBI's and the Kentucky Attorney General's Office's investigations. Wine wanted the charges dropped because the officers never mentioned Taylor by name to the grand jury or that they shot her. Walker's close friends said that his job was to protect Taylor at any cost. On May 26, 2020, Judge Olu Stevens granted Wine's motion to drop all charges against Walker. Rob Eggert, an attorney representing Walker, released a statement saying, \\"he just wanted to resume his life.\\" At the same time, his attorney said that he could be charged again later as more facts come out of the shooting. On June 16, Eggert filed a motion to permanently dismiss the indictment charging Walker with attempted murder and assault. The motion asked Stevens to grant Walker immunity because he was within his rights to defend himself and Taylor under Kentucky's stand-your-ground law. === Taylor's family === On May 15, Taylor's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit on behalf of the estate of Breonna Taylor against the officers and the city of Louisville. It states that Taylor and Walker were sleeping in the bedroom before the incident happened, and that the police officers were in unmarked vehicles. The lawsuit states that Taylor and Walker thought the apartment had been broken into by criminals and that \\"they were in significant, imminent danger.\\" The lawsuit alleges that \\"the officers then entered Breonna's home without knocking and without announcing themselves as police officers. The Defendants then proceeded to spray gunfire into the residence with a total disregard for the value of human life.\\" The lawsuit was resolved in mid- September 2020. The Louisville Metro Government () agreed to pay Taylor's estate $12 million, \\"one of the highest settlement amounts ever paid in America for the wrongful death of a Black woman by police\\", according to family attorney Benjamin Crump. The officers and the LMG admitted no liability nor wrongdoing and were absolved of any medical expenses related to Taylor's death and the settlement prevents Taylor's family from suing the city. The city agreed to initiate a housing credits program for police officers to live in the Louisville Metro area, a fundamental community policing measure, institute policing changes requiring more oversight by top commanders, and make mandatory safeguards that were only \\"common practice\\" before the raid. === Photographic and video evidence === On May 14, photos were released to the public in The Courier-Journal by Sam Aguiar, an attorney representing Taylor's family. The photos show bullet damage in their apartment and the apartment next door. The Louisville police claimed that none of the officers were wearing body cameras, as all three were plainclothes narcotics officers. On September 4, several news sources including The Courier-Journal, reported that photographs of police officers taken late that day showed that at least one wore a body camera. In the later photographs, one of the officers who fired his weapon, Myles Cosgrove, was wearing a mount for a body camera; another detective who was present wore a body camera, although it is not known whether it was active. == Policy and administrative changes == === Police department === On May 21, Police Chief Steve Conrad announced his retirement after intense local and national criticism for the department's handling of the case, to be effective June 30. Conrad was fired on June 1 after the fatal shooting of black business owner David McAtee. The LMPD announced in May that it would require all sworn officers to wear body cameras, and will change how it carries out search warrants. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer indefinitely suspended the use of no-knock warrants on May 29. === Legislative proposals === In June 2020, Democrats in Congress introduced the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, a broad bill containing measures to combat misconduct, excessive force, and racial bias in policing. The bill would prohibit the issuance of no-knock warrants in federal drug investigations and provide incentives to states to enact a similar prohibition. In June, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) introduced the Justice for Breonna Taylor Act, which would prohibit federal law enforcement from carrying out a warrant \\"until after the officer provides notice of his or her authority and purpose.\\" It would also apply to state and local law enforcement that receive funding from the Justice Department. On June 10, the Louisville city council voted unanimously to ban no-knock search warrants. The law is called Breonna's Law and requires all officers who serve warrants to wear body cameras and have them turned on from at least five minutes before the warrant is served to at least five minutes after. == Reactions == Breonna Taylor Memorial in Jefferson Square in Louisville, Kentucky For weeks after Taylor's death, there was very little public reaction or response from government officials, and the LMPD had not provided many details about the shooting or answers to questions about the case. === Politicians and public officials === On May 13, 2020, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear responded to reports about Taylor's death and said the public deserved to know everything about the March raid. Beshear requested that Attorney General Cameron and local and federal prosecutors review the Louisville police's initial investigation \\"to ensure justice is done at a time when many are concerned that justice is not blind.\\" On May 14, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer and LMPD Chief Steve Conrad announced they had asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney to review the local findings of the Public Integrity Unit's investigation when it is completed. === Protests === For months after the shooting, there were demands from Taylor's family, some members of the local community, and protesters worldwide that the officers involved in the shooting be fired and criminally charged. Multiple protesters, including friends and family of Taylor, protested outside Mayor Fischer's office on May 26, 2020, and demanded the three officers be arrested and charged with murder. Protesters in Indianapolis shouting out Taylor's name in remembrance for what would have been her 27th birthday. A protest against racism in Berlin, Germany, on June 6, 2020; demonstrators hold posters with the photos of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. On May 28, 500 to 600 demonstrators marched in Downtown Louisville, chanting, \\"No justice, no peace, prosecute police!\\" and \\"Breonna, Breonna, Breonna!\\" The protests continued into the early morning of May 29, when seven people were shot; one was in critical condition. At the same time, Taylor's sister, Juniyah Palmer, posted on her Facebook page, \\"At this point y'all are no longer doing this for my sister! You guys are just vandalizing stuff for NO reason, I had a friend ask people why they are there most didn't even know the 'protest' was for my sister.\\" These protests and demonstrations were part of the nationwide reaction to the killing of George Floyd, an African-American man who was killed in police custody on May 25, 2020. On May 27, one Louisville police sergeant said that \\"The comment section is full of 'All cops need to die' and 'Kill pigs' and things like that\\" and that several days earlier, while responding to a 911 call near Taylor's apartment, multiple people threw pieces of concrete at police officers (who were uninjured) and then ran away. On June 27, Steven Lopez was arrested after firing shots on the crowd of protestors gathered at Louisville's Jefferson Square Park, killing one and injuring another. Lopez had previously taken part in the Breonna Taylor protests before the incident took place as well, but later got into arguments with other Jefferson Park protestors which resulted in at least three reported physical confrontations. Lopez was also among a group of 17 Louisville protestors who had been arrested on June 17 for inciting a riot, disorderly conduct, harassment and possession of drug paraphernalia. On July 4, over 100 people participated in the Youth March for Freedom in downtown Louisville. The participants stopped at historical civil rights sites, and speakers called for the end of racial injustice and told the stories of the people affiliated with the sites. On July 14, the national social justice organization Until Freedom organized a march of over 100 people to the house of Kentucky attorney general Cameron, where protesters occupied his lawn, demanding charges against the officers involved in the killing. Police officers and a police helicopter were present as 87 protesters, including Houston Texans wide receiver Kenny Stills and The Real Housewives of Atlanta star Porsha Williams, were arrested and removed from the lawn. As of mid-July 2020, there have been about 50 days of protests. According to LMPD, 435 protesters have been arrested. On July 24, protesters marched into the NuLu area of Louisville, blocked the 600 block of E. Market Street with metal barricades and set up long metal tables for an impromptu block party to highlight demands for NuLU business owners, including hiring a more proportionate number of black workers. Police cleared the street and arrested 76 protesters who refused to leave. On July 25, 300 members of the Atlanta-based black militia NFAC (Not Fucking Around Coalition) marched in Louisville to Metro Hall with the street lined with local protesters. John \\"Grandmaster Jay\\" Johnson, founder of the NFAC, gave a speech calling on officials to speed up and be more transparent about the investigation into Taylor's death. As of August 10, LMPD had arrested 500 protesters over 75 days of protests. On September 23, the night after the grand jury verdict was announced, protesters gathered in the Jefferson Square Park area of Louisville as well as many other cities in the United States, including Los Angeles, Dallas, Minneapolis, New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Denver, Nashville, Philadelphia, Seattle, San Diego, Las Vegas, and Portland. The previous day, a state of emergency had been declared in Louisville in anticipation of the verdict announcement. In Louisville, two LMPD officers were shot during the protest and one suspect was kept in custody. Also in Louisville, two reporters from the right-wing website The Daily Caller were arrested and charged with breaking curfew and unlawful assembly. In Buffalo, a pickup truck was driven through a crowd of protesters, striking and injuring one. In Seattle, a police officer rode a bicycle over a man's head. In Denver, one person was detained for driving into a protester. No injuries were reported. === Other reactions === Commentators such as Arwa Mahdawi and Brittney Cooper suggested Taylor's killing would likely not have received so much attention if not for the George Floyd protests, as black women are often neglected. Mahdawi related this to the #SayHerName campaign and Malcolm X's statement \\"The most disrespected person in America is the black woman,\\" and called for further protest until justice for Taylor is secured. \\"Arrest the cops that killed Breonna Taylor\\" has become a common Internet meme. It has been criticized for trivializing the incident by being akin to the meme \\"Epstein didn't kill himself\\". In late July 2020, American record producer J. W. Lucas, who is white, made controversial statements on Twitter that seemed to justify Taylor's murder, which received extremely negative reactions, including from activist Tamika Mallory, with whom he later had a heated exchange on Instagram Live. Rapper Jack Harlow, whose single \\"Whats Poppin\\" Lucas produced, publicly denounced Lucas, saying that he didn't know who Lucas was and wasn't aware of his involvement in the song. The September 2020 edition of O magazine featured Taylor on the cover instead of the usual image of Oprah Winfrey as a way to honor \\"her life and the life of every other black woman whose life has been taken too soon\\". It was the first issue in the magazine's 20-year history that did not have Winfrey's image on its cover. Twenty-six billboards‚Äìone for every year of Taylor's life‚Äìwere put up around Louisville by Until Freedom and O magazine. Winfrey released a video five months after Taylor's death calling for the arrest of the officers involved. Professional sports teams and individual athletes have honored Taylor and called for the end of racial injustice. Before the 2019‚Äì20 NBA season restarted, the Memphis Grizzlies wore shirts with Taylor's name and \\"#SayHerName\\" as they arrived at the arena. The September 2020 edition of Vanity Fair featured a painting of Taylor by Amy Sherald on the cover. The issue included an interview with Taylor's mother by author Ta-Nehisi Coates. At the 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton wore a t-shirt on the podium with the words \\"Arrest the cops that killed Breonna Taylor.\\" The governing body, the FIA, considered investigating Hamilton for violating the protocols for political messaging, but decided no investigation was necessary. In September 2020, George Clooney issued a statement in which he said that he was \\"ashamed\\" by the decision to charge Hankison with wanton endangerment rather than with Taylor's death. == See also == * Berwyn Heights, Maryland mayor's residence drug raid * Jose Guerena shooting * Killing of Bernardo Palacios- Carbajal * Shooting of Atatiana Jefferson * George Floyd protests * 2020 United States racial unrest * Lists of killings by law enforcement officers in the United States ==Notes== == References == == External links == * Category:2020 controversies in the United States Category:2020 in Kentucky Category:2020 United States racial unrest Category:African-American history in Louisville, Kentucky Category:African-American-related controversies Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Black Lives Matter Category:Black people shot dead by law enforcement officers in the United States Category:Deaths by person in the United States Category:Law enforcement controversies in the United States Category:March 2020 events in the United States Category:No-knock warrant Category:Protests in the United States Category:Law enforcement in Kentucky ","title":"Shooting of Breonna Taylor"},{"id":"63948077","text":"Elizabeth Joyce \\"Betty\\" Slade (18 June 1921 - 3 November 2000) was a British diver.

It is an informal security arrangement that is not based on a formal collective defence pact, but it is instead based on tacit agreements. It is unique from an alliance as the states do not have this formal collective defence pact. These two states may remain unallied due to alliance hindrances such as historical animosity, but still share a common, powerful ally capable of diminishing the two states' security fears; security fears caused by a common threat. == Characteristics == === Structure === A quasi-alliance can exist as either bilateral or multilateral. This means two nations cooperating or as multiple states jointly cooperating, respectively. The political actors involved constitute both sovereign and non-sovereign actors. This means that a non-sovereign nation may partake because there is no formal alliance. The alliance is a form of military and security cooperation that always targets a third-party. The targeting of a third-party can either be explicit or implicit. === Practicalities === A quasi-alliance is formed through a tacit agreement as opposed to being established by a formal agreement. Therefore, they are not formalised as the alliance is instead implied. Therefore, the alliance itself may also be tacit, though it is also possible for them to exist in ad hoc. Because the management of the alliance cannot rely on formalised agreements, those involved must rely on mutual expectations. Mutual expectations may be based on communiqu√©s, joint declarations, memoranda, treaties of friendship, declarations on the press conference, domestic laws or United Nations resolutions. == Theoretical model == The Quasi-Alliance Model, developed by Victor Cha from a Neoclassical realism approach, aims to explain why states form quasi-alliances based on concerns of abandonment and entrapment. The concepts of abandonment and entrapment were introduced by Glenn Snyder. Abandonment refers to the fear of an ally leaving, or failing to live up to the expectations of the alliance; entrapment refers to the alliance becoming detrimental to the state's own interests. Entrapment can be an occurrence of chain ganging. The model proposes three behavioural patterns of states within an alliance regarding abandonment and entrapment: * A state fearing abandonment will show a stronger commitment to the alliance, hoping for the ally to reciprocate this commitment. * A state fearing entrapment will show a weaker commitment to the alliance, hoping for the ally to be more compromising towards adversity. * States aim to maximise the attainable security from the alliance, while minimising their obligations to the alliance. Based on these propositions, the theoretical model explains why states in a quasi-alliance benefit from the presence of the third-party state. Bilateral alliances are the inner core of the quasi-alliance, and the multilateral alliance with respect to the third- party ally is the outer core. If the inner core represents an asymmetrical concern of abandonment and entrapment between the bilateral alliance, there will not be cooperation. The presence of a third-party state in the outer core can resolve the asymmetrical concern by reducing the fears of abandonment and offering security. Yet, the bilateral states may strengthen their alliance further and increase cooperation out of the new fear of abandonment from their third-party state. Regardless of the asymmetrical and symmetrical nature of the quasi-alliance, the actions of the third-party is the most important factor to cooperative relations; this overrides the importance of changes in the international security environment, domestic attitudes and the status of the bilateral relations. === Conflicting theories === The balance of threat model is the main opposing theory to the quasi-alliance model. The balance of threat model explains alliance formation as a result of threats, that there is a correlation between higher levels of threat and higher levels of alliance formation. The quasi-alliance model critiques this for excluding the commitment of the third-party ally. Alliance formation is instead more probable when there is not a commitment of a third-party ally, and the existence of a threat does not have the relevance claimed by the balance of threat model. When there is not a strong commitment of a third-party ally: alliances will form. If there is a strong commitment of a third-party ally, there is a greater incentive for states to ally because there is not a guarantor of security. == Examples == ===Japan-Korea=== Japan-Korea relations may be referred to as a quasi-alliance, as the two states remain unallied, but share a common threat, North Korea, and a common ally, the United States. The two states remain unallied mainly due to historical animosity rooting from the period of Japanese colonialism. The states began normalising their diplomatic relations in 1965 after the Treaty on Basic Relations. ===Australia-Japan=== Australia-Japan relations prior to September 18th 2015 were referred to as a relationship of \\"non-traditional security\\" based on disaster relief efforts and international peacekeeping operations. After September 18th 2015 and the election of Tony Abbott as Australian prime minister, the \\"Special strategic partnership\\" was announced. This represented greater cooperation between Australia and Japan in defence technology, maritime security, peace and new areas of future cooperation. It is a quasi-alliance because the United States is there common ally, while Australia and Japan act as partners in the trilateral cooperation. They also cooperate on the joint fear of China disrupting the status quo of maritime affairs. ===Greece-Israel-Cyprus=== Greece-Israel-Cyprus relations can be classified as a quasi-alliance because they have not signed a formal military treaty although they maintain a strong relationship with a security aspect as well. Their relations are defined by the Energy Triangle and the possible vulnerabilities from energy insecurities. The quasi-alliance is driven by their individual and collective motivations. Regarding the collective motivations, Greece and Israel maintain an quasi- alliance with Cyprus in part because of their common perception of Turkey as a threat. These perceptions stem -as per the balance of threat theory- from geographical proximity, offensive capabilities and perceived intentions. The deterioration of Israel-Turkey relations and the discovery of hydrocarbons triggered the establishment of a quasi-alliance for a joint security from Turkey in the early 2010s. == References == Category:Treaties by type == Quasi-alliance == ","title":"Quasi-alliance"},{"id":"63948123","text":"==Statistics== ===Progression charts=== Total confirmed cases, active cases, deaths, and recoveries On 8 April 2020, the Robert Koch Institute began using another method to estimate the numbers of recoveries, now also incorporating cases where the date of the first symptoms is unknown. This caused the singular sharp drop in active cases on that date. New cases per day Daily infection rate Reproduction rate The effective reproduction number or reproduction rate, symbolised with Re, is a rate of how many more people are infected from a positive COVID-19 case. In order to suppress an outbreak, the reproduction rate must be constantly below 1, which means each positive case infects less than one person. The Robert Koch Institute measures the reproduction rate as a moving 4-day average of the number of new symptomatic cases using a nowcasting according to the 4-day average number of new cases on a specific day and comparing it with the corresponding mean 4 days before, reflecting the spread of the disease roughly one to two weeks before any specific day. As it is however prone to larger fluctuation, taking into account possible delays in reporting, a 7-day rate is then introduced, which compares the 7-day average of cases at one specific date with 4 days before. Specific values have been published since its daily report on 7 April, while the R-rate has been calculated from 6 March. Number of tests per week Since the beginning of testing in Germany up to and including week 40/2020, 18,129,900 laboratory tests in at least 202 laboratories have been recorded to date, 346,865 of which have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted. New numbers were published once a day in the afternoon. Starting 17 March 2020, new numbers are published at midnight (0:00) for the previous day. ===Data discussion=== Testing Until late March, due to the restrictive Robert Koch Institute (RKI) testing criteria, Germans without specific symptoms could not be tested. On 25 March 2020, the RKI announced that people no longer needed to come from risk areas to be tested. In the revised criteria, acute respiratory symptoms were generally maintained, with one additional criterion of the following having to be fulfilled: contact to a confirmed positive case in the last 14 days; work in health care; membership in a risk group; and in case of serious illness, no differential diagnosis. RKI president Wieler said that tests should be conducted in a \\"targeted and strategically sensible\\" manner, in order to avoid overstraining testing capacities. Mildly ill patients would not always be able to get tested, in which case they would be asked to remain at home and minimise contact with others. Wieler announced that the taking of representative samples in order to assess the number of infected more reliably would commence soon. Calls for conducting such studies were raised concurrently. Reporting lag Incubation period, and turn around time of the only diagnostic test (PCR) can lead to a reporting lag of five to ten days. Because of the federal health care system in Germany, federal countries vary in data collection, aggregation and time of release to the public. Local (Landkreise / Kreisfreie St√§dte) health departments initially reported data to the federal country health department which transferred data to the nations federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal country health departments are added earlier to a project by Funke Mediengruppe, to which Berliner Morgenpost belongs. Johns Hopkins University seems to use the numbers of the Funke project for Germany indirectly while the Funke project uses numbers of Johns Hopkins University for other countries. As of 25 March, the number of unknown cases was thought to be up to tenfold higher. Statistician Katharina Sch√ºller advocated for representative sampling to gauge the real number of infected people, an initiative supported by the president of German Medical Association and scientists of Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Number of deaths As of March 2020, the reported death rate calculated as the number of deaths divided by the number of infected in Germany was lower than in some other areas such as Italy, for example. This has led foreign media to applaud or question it, while virologists, among others the leader of the RKI, warned that the country was simply at an earlier stage of the outbreak and fatalities would soon increase. Possible explanations have included: * Germany tested more extensively, which decreased the uncertainty about the proportion of asymptomatic infected and brought the calculated mortality rate closer to the actual (lower) mortality rate. The extensive testing found younger and less sick people more often: their median age was given as 47 or 45 years, whereas Italy tested older and sicker people at a median of 63 years. Many early infections happened in skiers returning from Tyrol, who tended to be fit people rather than persons at higher risk of complications, and contributed a negligible mortality. * Since Germany has no routine for post-mortem tests, unlike Italy it may not have discovered all deaths. In Spain, the first death was also discovered by a test carried out post-mortem. * The elderly in Germany often do not live in the same household as their extended family and this has reduced the number of infections. * Germany has many test laboratories and a weekly test capacity of 160 thousand and could have a lower number of unrecorded cases of infections than for example Italy, though the number of tests including negative results was unknown until 23 March. * Italy has several times fewer hospital beds for intensive respiratory care than Germany. While Italy and Spain ran out of beds, German hospitals still had free capacity. The number of beds, protective gear and the number of medical personnel can become bottlenecks for providing adequate care. However, as of the end of March, it was \\"too early to say whether Germany is better medically prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic than other countries\\". * Daily reported death tolls increased in the first half of April; the Robert-Koch-Institut attributed this to the fact that there was a growing number of outbreaks in care homes, whose elderly populations were particularly vulnerable. Criticism On 7 May 2020, Stephan Kohn, Oberregierungsrat (\\"senior government official\\") in the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community, published a document based on a large number of statistical surveys in which he harshly criticised the government's assessment of and reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.KM4 Analyse des Krisenmanagements (Kurzfassung), Stephan Kohn, 7.

She was one of ten children. When her father died while working as an engineer on the railways at Mullingar under William Dargan, the family were left impoverished. Locke was 17 when she married John Edward Locke, the son of John and Mary Anne Locke in 1881. The couple lived in Brusna House beside Locke's Distillery. They had two daughters, Mary Evelyn known as Sweet, and Florence Emily known as Flo. Due to her interest in hunting and the Westmeath Hunt, Locke earned the nickname \\"Muds\\". She had a number of extramarital affairs with men in the area, leading to her husband forcing her out of their home in 1895. He began divorce proceedings in February 1896. This drew much attention due to the prominence of the Locke family and their association with the Mercy convent in Kilbeggan. When the divorce was finalised, Locke received an annual allowance of ¬£600, and despite her reduced circumstances, she continued to take part in the Westmeath Hunt and was among the first women in Westmeath to drive a car. After her divorce, she lived in Ballinagore house, near Kilbeggan with her children. Locke travelled to France after the outbreak of World War I, working in various hospitals with the Red Cross. She returned to Ireland and worked with the Westmeath Auxiliary Red Cross Hospital in Mullingar. She was later awarded medals from the French government for her work. She had been a shareholder in Locke's distillery after her ex-husband's death in 1920, but did not become a director until the death of her brother-in-law, James Harvey Locke. She held the post until her death, but had a limited role in the company.

Formed as a conventional field artillery regiment in 1942, it was sent to Burma where it was given a range of specialist roles, ranging from operating tracked self-propelled guns to manning light howitzers parachuted into jungle clearings. After the Japanese surrender, it saw action in the Allied Occupation of Java before disbanding in late 1946. ==Organisation== 178th Field Regiment was formed in the Royal Artillery (RA) on 29 January 1942 in the West Country with the following organisation:Frederick, p. 539. * Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) * 122 Field Battery ‚Äì previously independent; originally raised on 14 July 1941 in Taunton for 24th Field Regiment in the Regular ArmyFrederick, p. 506. * 366 (10th London) Field Battery ‚Äì previously independent; originally part of 140th (5th London) Field Regiment in the Territorial Army (TA); recently returned from garrison duty in IcelandFrederick, p. 532. * 516 Field Battery ‚Äì originally raised on 14 July 1941 in Elgin, Scotland, for 126th (Highland) Field Regiment in the TAFrederick, p. 530. On 15 May 1942 the new regiment was assigned to 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, which was being re-assembled in Western Command after a period of service in Iceland. However, on 28 December the regiment left the division and (together with its Signal Section of the Royal Corps of Signals and Light Aid Detachment of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers) came under direct control of the War Office preparatory to embarking for service overseas in March 1943.Joslen, pp. 79‚Äì80.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non- Divisional Units), 22 November 1942, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, files WO 212/8 and WO 33/1962.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 18 February 1943, TNA files WO 212/9 and WO 33/1987. ==Burma== Priest SP gun in Burma. 178th Field Rgt arrived at Bombay in India on 10 June 1943 under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel K.M. Wright, and went to Bangalore where it joined XXXIII Indian Corps. On 17 July it moved to Poona and came under the command of 36th Indian Division. On 1 August it was redesignated 178th Assault Field Regiment, 122 Bty being given eight Priest 105 mm self-propelled (SP) guns and 366 Bty getting eight 3.7 inch Mountain Howitzers, while 516 retained the standard towed 25-pounder field gun. 'Assault Field Regiments' were equipped and trained for assault landings from the sea, but most of the planned amphibious operations in Burma were cancelled because of a lack of landing craft, even for training, before 1945. 366 Battery was sometimes referred to as 366 Light Battery because of its small guns: the 3.7-inch howitzer was also chosen for the new 'Jungle Field Regiments' because of its accuracy at close range and for its high angle fire.Farndale, Annex K, p. 363.Farndale, Annex O, p. 381.Farndale, p. 173.Joslen, p. 510.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 2‚Äì3, 10‚Äì11, 14, 27, 61, 66‚Äì7, 254, Appendix 3. ===Arakan=== 36th Indian Division was in reserve for the Second Arakan Offensive launched in January 1944. The Japanese counter-attacked fiercely in the 'Battle of the Admin Box', and the division was hurried up to the area. 178th Assault Fd Rgt moved into the Arakan on 10 February, but 122 Bty's Priests were replaced by towed 25-pounders. By early March the division was deployed south of Ngakyedauk ('Okeydoke') Pass and pushed eastwards to clear the railway tunnels as the besieged 'Admin Box' of 7th Indian Infantry Division was relieved. The regiment was attached to 25th Indian Division on 9 April for the attack on Point 551 which involved days of bitter fighting that effectively ended the Arakan campaign before the arrival of the Monsoon.Farndale, pp. 165, 182.Farndale, pp. 226‚Äì7.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 127, 139, 155‚Äì9, 266‚Äì74. 36th Indian Division was withdrawn from Arakan in May 1944 and made available to reinforce the Allied campaign in northern Burma. 178th Assault Fd Rgt rejoined it for the move to Shillong, which began on 12 May and was completed by 7 June. All the division's amphibious assault equipment was returned to the amphibious warfare training school and the division reorganised as a standard infantry division.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 251‚Äì2, 274, 355.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, p. 25. ===Railway Corridor=== 3.7-inch Howitzer in action in Burma. 36th Indian Division was now assigned to reinforce US Gen Joseph Stilwell's Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC). In July it moved to Ledo, where the infantry units began to be airlifted into Myitkyina airfield to replace the exhausted Chindits. At first no guns or transport could be sent, the divisional artillery remaining at Shillong. However, 178th Assault Fd Rgt, with 321 Anti-Tank Bty attached from 122nd (Royal Warwickshire Regiment) Light Anti-Aircraft/Anti-Tank Rgt, moved up to Ledo ready to move into the forward area. On 18 August, while 36th Division was advancing on the Japanese stronghold of Pinbaw, it was augmented by six of 366 Lt Bty's mountain howitzers, which were successfully dropped by parachute close to the tactical HQ of 29th Brigade. Pinbaw was captured on 25 August, although most of the supporting bombardment came from aircraft of US Tenth Air Force. 36th Division then began pushing along 'Railway Corridor', entirely supplied by air until the railway and roads could be repaired.Farndale, pp. 222‚Äì3, 229.Jeff, p. 51.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 355‚Äì6, 404‚Äì5, 413.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 23, 40‚Äì1. On 1 September 1944, 36th Indian Division was redesignated as a British division, the majority of the Indian Army units having been transferred.Joslen, pp. 63‚Äì4.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, p. 143. The gunners of the rest of 178th Assault Fd Rgt were flown into Burma to join the division on 15 October (321 A/T Bty having returned unused to Shillong in September). When NCAC began its post-Monsoon offensive on 16 October 1944, 36th Division was the only formation in contact with the enemy, and was the first to run into heavy opposition on 25 October, at a Japanese defensive position that blocked all roads. This was broken through on 29 October and Mawlu occupied on 31 October, but then the Japanese began to raid the division's precarious supply route and the advance halted until the following Chinese division broke through to Mawlu. Resuming its advance along the railway corridor, 36th Division captured Pinwe on 30 November, and occupied Indaw, Naba and Katha, reaching the Irrawaddy and Shweli Rivers without opposition during December. It continued to push along the river valleys in January 1945, meeting occasional rearguards, until it found the river crossing on the Shweli bend at Myitson to be strongly held.Farndale, pp. 243, 253.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 143‚Äì5, 192‚Äì6, 275. ===Meiktila and Mandalay=== A 25-pounder of 36th Division in action in Burma, 1944. 36th Division was now the only part of NCAC in action, on the left flank of Fourteenth Army, which was closing in on Meiktila and Mandalay in Central Burma. While the British Division forced a bridgehead at Myitson and then advanced south (supplied by air) to link up with Fourteenth Army, NCAC was broken up and its Chinese elements returned to China. By the end of March, Fourteenth Army had won the Battle of Mandalay and was preparing to advance on Rangoon.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 275‚Äì8, 302, 315‚Äì8, 326, Sketches 10, 11, 14. While Fourteenth Army fought the Battle of the Rangoon Road, 36th Division cleared the area east of Meiktila, supplied by road from the Mandalay airhead and by supply drops to the forward troops by US Tenth Air Force. However, the difficulty of supplying and reinforcing British formations in Central Burma meant that 36th Division was selected to be flown out before the onset of the Monsoon and the withdrawal of US aircraft to China. On 5 May 1945 178th Assault Fd Rgt was flown to Imphal, and then moved to the rest areas round Poona, arriving on 15 May.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, pp. 325‚Äì6, 338, 383, 388. ==Operation Zipper== While 36th Division remained in India for the rest of the war, 178th Assault Fd Rgt left on 5 July 1945 and moved to Nazik, where it joined 23rd Indian Division two days later. This division was preparing for Operation Zipper, an amphibious invasion of Malaya to be launched from India. The division was intended to sail from Bombay and Madras to make an assault landing on beaches near Port Dickson and then capture that harbour. The operation was planned for 9‚Äì12 September 1945, but following the Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the Japanese surrender was signed on 2 September. Nevertheless, Zipper went ahead, without the preliminary bombardment, and greeted by a Japanese envoy to arrange the surrender of Japanese forces in Malaya and takeover by British and Indian forces. The landing beaches proved troublesome, and vehicles could not be unloaded until 12 September. 23rd Division took over the Seremban‚ÄìCape Rachado‚ÄìPort Dickson area, sending out columns to disarm Japanese troops and put down banditry and inter-communal fighting that had broken out.Farndale, pp. 307‚Äì8.Woodburn Kirby, Vol V, pp. 64‚Äì5, 68, 267‚Äì71, 274; Appendices 4 & 7. ==Occupation of Java== 23rd Division's stay in Malaya was brief because it was required in Java in the Netherlands East Indies. The British and Indian troops were only expected to take the Japanese surrenders and coordinate the repatriation of Prisoners of War. However, an independent state had been declared and there was a state of civil war between the nationalists and the Dutch colonial forces. An Allied Occupation became necessary. The first British battalion to land at Batavia had to deal with looting, arson and riots. On 3 October it was joined by 1st Indian Brigade Group, including 178th Assault Fd Rgt. The gunners took over guarding internment camps, the airfield and the dock area. The brigade was soon fully occupied in trying to maintain order in the face of looting and murders, and reinforcements had to be sent. British and Indian troops were engaged in serious actions across the island and suffered considerable casualties, while the released prisoners, internees and refugees were collected at Batavia where they could be protected. By early 1946 the situation was quieter and evacuation of Japanese troops and displaced persons continued, but armed clashes still occurred. The whole of 23rd Division was moved to the Bandoeng‚ÄìBuitenzorg area in February to deal with a reported build-up of extremists in the area. Because of raids on the roads, convoy protection required tanks and 25-pounders fighting pitched battles, and the division and the internees had to be supplied by air. The Royal Netherlands Army arrived in March to take over responsibility, but 23rd Division was retained in west Java until the autumn while evacuation of internees continued.Farndale, pp. 314‚Äì9.Woodburn Kirby, Vol V, pp. 274, 314‚Äì49. 178th Assault Fd Rgt was joined on 1 June 1946 by 395 Bty from 145th (Berkshire Yeomanry) Fd Rgt which was being placed in suspended animation. 395 Battery in turn disbanded on 14 September.Frederick, p. 533. 23rd Division began to withdraw from Java in stages in the autumn. Regimental HQ of 178th Assault Fd Rgt disbanded at Batavia on 30 November 1946 and the two TA batteries (366 and 514) were placed in suspended animation pending the reform of their parent regiments in the UK in 1947.Woodburn Kirby, Vol V, p. 350. ==Fotnotes== ==Notes== ==References== * Gen Sir Martin Farndale, History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery: The Far East Theatre 1939‚Äì1946, London: Brasseys, 2002, . * J.B.M.

Along with her mentor Cora Hind, she was a pioneering Western woman journalist at a time when the field was dominated by men. Her writing documented the early 20th century experience of the Canadian West, from country fairs to the impact of the Depression to the development of the oil sands. == Early life == Miriam was born to Canadian parents in 1879 in Richville, New York. She spent most of her childhood in Athens, Ontario, attended high school in Toronto at Bishop Strachan School, and earned an A.T.C.M. (Associate of the Toronto Conservatory of Music) from the Toronto Conservatory of Music. When her family moved across the country to Edmonton in 1904, she met George Edward Ellis, an educator and bureaucrat. The couple married in 1905 when she was 25 and he was 31. They later moved to Prince Albert, Saskatchewan so George could take the role of principal at the Prince Albert Collegiate Institute. When World War I broke, George enlisted as a major in the 53rd Battalion (Northern Saskatchewan), CEF, but when he was \\"dismissed for misconduct,\\" the couple separated and George relocated to Ontario. == Career == For many years, Miriam worked as a freelance journalist, publishing in a handful of local Saskatchewan papers, like the Prince Albert Daily Herald and the Regina Leader-Post. In 1919, she moved to Edmonton to begin covering the Legislature as a reporter for the Edmonton Bulletin, a paper run by Edmonton businessman Frank Oliver (politician). In 1920, Miriam organized the first regional conference for the Canadian Women's Press Club (CWPC), in Edmonton, attended by 50 women journalists. She had joined the CWPC in 1913 and served as president of the Edmonton branch in 1919. In subsequent years, she fulfilled roles as vice- president for Edmonton branch, area director for the Manitoba branch, and chair of the Beneficiary Fund and Memorial Awards board. At the organization's triennal in 1956, celebrated in Edmonton, Miriam delivered a talk summarizing the history of the CWPC. Her participation in the CWPC led to several key friendships in her life, including Emily Murphy and Nellie McClung. Through her reporting at the Edmonton Bulletin, Miriam discovered that the Canadian North was an area of rapid development. In 1922, after her editor Frank Oliver refused to finance her idea, she undertook a self-funded trip to Aklavik in the Northwest Territories. Equipped with a typewriter and camera, she travelled mostly by river steamer up the Mackenzie River, documenting the life of the communities she encountered, including Cree, Dene, Gwich'in and Inuit. Places she visited and photographed included Waterways, Alberta, Fort McMurray, Fort McKay, Fort Chipewyan, Fort Smith, Fort Resolution, Hay River, Fort Providence, Fort Simpson, Fort Norman, Fort Good Hope, Fort McPherson, and, finally, Aklavik. The trip resulted in many striking photographs of life in the North. Miriam created a series of magic lantern slides using a calotype process to add colour, by hand, to her black and white photographs on glass slides. She toured to New York City and across Canada to share her images and recount her observations from her journey. Miriam also published 40 newspaper articles about her trip. Following her Northern adventures, Miriam quit the Edmonton Bulletin to become a freelancer, and the Montreal-based Family Herald and Weekly Star published a lot of her work. When the paper offered her a position as western editor in 1927, she relocated to Winnipeg, serving 25 years in that role before her retirement in 1952. Covering agriculture in Western Canada, she developed a reputation as a knowledgeable and confident reporter. To mark her retirement from the Family Herald and Weekly Star, 100 past colleagues and acquaintances from five provinces gathered in Winnipeg for a dinner to celebrate her legacy. Miriam continued freelancing until 1957. == Further reading == * Travels and Tales of Miriam Green Ellis : Pioneer Journalist of the Canadian West. Edmonton: University of Alberta Press, 2013.

In 1923, he arrive in the United States. He studied at the National Academy of Design in New York City. ==Career== In 1926, Siegel had a woodcut illustration published in Der Hammer (to which Moyshe Nadir contributed): \\"in an intentionally crude style, Siegel portrayed many workers shouting slogans at what was clearly a protest rally.\\" As early as 1926, Siegel published work in the New Masses magazine as a \\"contributing editor\\". He also contributed to books and pamphlets of International Publishers, the printing arm of the Communist Party USA headed by Alexander Trachtenberg. In the early 1930s, Siegel began his career as a book illustrator. During the Great Depression, he illustrated children's stories for the Works Projects Administration through the New York Board of Education. By 1931, Siegel was a member of the John Reed Clubs and showed his work with fellow members Jacob Burck, Hugo Gellert, William Gropper, and Louis Lozowick among others. For the club, he served in 1934 as secretary of a Birobidzhan art committee. He also exhibited at the John Reed Club's ACA Galleries in New York City. In 1934, the New School of Social Research in New York City exhibited some drawings and possibly watercolors by Siegel as well as Anton Refregier.

Long treated by the police as an eyewitness of the assassination of prime minister Olof Palme, Engstr√∂m was proposed as the assassin by Swedish writers Lars Larsson and, separately, Thomas Pettersson. Krister Petersson, prosecutor in charge of the investigation, announced the closing of the case at a press conference on 10 June 2020, stating twenty years after Engstr√∂m's death that he was the prime suspect in the murder, but that the evidence against him would have been too weak for a trial. Retrieved 10 June 2020 In line with Swedish media reporting practices of not disclosing the names of suspects, Engstr√∂m was dubbed The Skandia Man (), since he had arrived at the crime scene from the nearby head office of the Skandia insurance company, where he worked. After Petersson's announcement in 2020, Swedish media refers to him by name. ==Biography== Stig Engstr√∂m was born in Bombay, India, to Swedish parents from Sm√•land. His mother, Ruth Engstr√∂m, was from Nybro; his father, Folke Engstr√∂m, worked for Ivar Kreuger. In 1926, his father received the opportunity from his employer to move to India to start up production there. During the couple's time in Bombay, they gave birth to Stig Engstr√∂m in 1934; his brother was born in 1940 in Calcutta. They grew up in British India and had a nanny, a chef, and a gardener. Engstr√∂m returned to Sweden when he was twelve years old and lived with relatives of the family until his parents also returned a few years later. He attended the same elite school as Palme (but not at the same time). While Engstr√∂m showed artistic and athletic talent, he did not excel academically and never graduated or went to university. Engstr√∂m did his mandatory military service before starting his studies to become a graphic designer. For some time, he worked for the Swedish military procurement establishment, designing and illustrating field manuals. During the late 1960s, he was hired by Sveriges Radios f√∂rlag and later by the insurance company Skandia to do designer work for them in Stockholm, a position which he held until retirement. Engstr√∂m married in 1964, but later divorced. He married a second time in 1968. Besides his work as a graphic designer, he was briefly involved in the Moderate Party in T√§by, where he lived. Engstr√∂m's work for the party included design, print work, and advertising. He eventually left the Moderates because of a disagreement over a school closure with his local party association. In 1999, his second marriage dissolved and in June 2000, he died in his home, at the age of 66. ==Palme assassination== The Skandia Building (Skandiahuset), where Engstr√∂m worked (2010 photo). Palme was shot at the corner, outside the Kreatima shop window. Engstr√∂m had exited from the Skandia front lobby, midway up the building to the left. The killer escaped to the right, between the two buildings. Engstr√∂m was one of some twenty people present at the scene when Prime Minister Olof Palme was fatally shot with a .357 magnum revolver in central Stockholm, late in the evening of 28 February 1986. Witness testimony was vague and contradictory, describing a man of medium height, wearing a dark coat or, according to a small minority of witnesses, a blue jacket, who may or may not have worn some form of headgear (witness testimony varied between no headgear; a rolled-up knit cap; a hat; or a cap that possibly had ear-flaps). The killer escaped by foot, and was likely spotted a couple hundred meters from the crime scene by a pair that described a man of uncertain appearance in a dark coat, dark clothing, fidgeting with a small bag. Engstr√∂m had clocked out of work and chatted with security guards at the main entrance to the Skandia insurance company only one or two minutes before the shooting. On leaving the building, he was wearing a dark coat, a cap that possibly had ear flaps, a colorful scarf, glasses, and carried a small bag. Some twenty minutes later, he returned to the building to tell the guards that the prime minister had been shot, just forty meters from the lobby entrance. After that, he is believed to have gone home. Police had failed to hold and question several key witnesses on the night of the murder, and some of them reported to authorities only after national television and radio had broadcast a police request for information on the killing. Engstr√∂m, too, said he had not been interviewed by the police at the scene, despite approaching an officer to give his story. The day after Palme's murder, he called a police tip hotline, stating that he had walked out of the Skandia gate around the time of the shooting, arriving to Palme's dead body moments later, as one of the first few witnesses on the scene. Over five police interrogations and several media interviews, Engstr√∂m maintained that he had participated in the rescue attempt in some fashion, by helping to turn or adjust Palme's body; had spoken a few words with Palme's wife, Lisbeth; had pointed out the killer's escape route when police arrived; and had subsequently dashed after police to hand them information he had learned from Palme's wife, but aborted the run when realizing that they had moved away too far. He said he had tried to report himself as a witness to police on the scene, but had been brushed off. However, no other witnesses clearly recalled him being at the scene, and his descriptions of himself as an active or even leading figure on the scene were hard to reconcile with the testimony presented by other witnesses. A handful of the witnesses on the scene were questioned about whether they had seen Engstr√∂m; two responded that they had not, whereas two others said they had, but only after initial hesitation and, in one case, offering details that also seemed to match another witness. Complicating matters, the fact that Engstr√∂m had sought media attention after the event reduced the evidentiary value of witness recollections of his appearance, since his face was now publicly known. After briefly treating him as a person of interest, the police dismissed Engstr√∂m as an unreliable witness and publicity-seeker who was making a nuisance of himself. He would no longer figure in the official investigation, which instead began to pursue a later-discredited lead about PKK involvement. ==Quest for media attention== Engstr√∂m had long been known to friends, colleagues, and family as an attention-seeking person with a taste for drama, and he had appeared a few times in the Swedish media before the assassination. In 1982, he was interviewed by Svenska Dagbladet about gender, after a questionnaire-based survey had identified him as highly \\"androgynous\\"; stressing that he was a heterosexual, he said he considered himself to have both male and female personality traits. After the assassination, Engstr√∂m embarked on a quest for publicity, calling reporters and offering to tell his story already the day after the murder. He would appear in several Swedish media outlets, criticizing the murder investigation and the Swedish police's lack of interest in his testimony. When investigators failed to invite Engstr√∂m to the police reconstruction of the crime in April 1986, he contacted a television journalist and offered to dress up in the clothes he had worn on the night of the murder and stage his own reconstruction. It was broadcast on Sveriges Television. Engstr√∂m's final interview about the case was in 1992 for the magazine Skydd & S√§kerhet; once again, Engstr√∂m had contacted a friend who worked as a journalist for the magazine. ===The \\"Skandia Man\\" theories=== Due to the failure to solve Palme's assassination and repeated revelations of police misconduct, alternative theories about the murder began to proliferate in the late 1980s and 1990s. Private enthusiasts, journalists, and authors began to propose a variety of possible suspects, scenarios, and conspiracy theories, ranging from CIA, KGB, or South African involvement to a variety of lone gunmen theories, police conspiracies, connections to the Bofors arms sales scandal, and other more or less credible plots. In the media, there emerged a cottage industry of so-called \\"privatspanare\\", a somewhat derogatory term for self-appointed investigators. Engstr√∂m was initially of as little interest to the \\"privatspanare\\" as to the police, given that the random nature of Palme's movement on the night of the murder seemed to preclude that Engstr√∂m had timed his exit from the Skandia building to intercept the prime minister. However, in the early 1990s, Olle Minell, a journalist for the Communist magazine Prolet√§ren, depicted Engstr√∂m as connected to a rightwing deep state intrigue against Palme. However, although Minell argued that Engstr√∂m might have been a part of the murder plot, he did not believe that he was the actual shooter. The theory that Engstr√∂m was the assassin of Olof Palme, as a lone gunman, was first brought up in Lars Larsson's book Nationens Fiende (Enemy of the State) in 2016. The allegation later reappeared in an article by journalist Thomas Pettersson in the magazine Filter in 2018, and in his book Den osannolika m√∂rdaren (The Unlikely Murderer), which was published the same year. Pettersson's book also broached theories that Palme had been shot by Swedish intelligence or on orders of the CIA, but ended up agreeing with Larsson's depiction of Engstr√∂m as having randomly met and shot Palme outside his office building. According to the theories presented by authors Larsson and Pettersson, which were developed separately but largely overlap, Engstr√∂m had in fact arrived to the scene earlier than he admitted (which, according to Skandia's employee time clock, was quite possible), spotting Palme only as he exited the building. (Pettersson suggests he could have stalked Palme earlier during the evening with a mind to killing him, then aborted the plan, only to accidentally encounter Palme again when he left his office.) As, for reasons unknown, he happened to carry a loaded gun, he decided to murder the prime minister. According to the Larsson-Pettersson argument, Engstr√∂m then fled the area, but, counterintuitively, almost immediately returned to the crime scene (Larsson) or straight to the Skandia building (Pettersson). By reporting himself to the police as a witness and approaching mass media with forged accounts based on elements gleaned from newspaper reporting, he had aimed to muddle witness recollections and confuse the police about his actual role. Both Larsson and Pettersson stressed that Engstr√∂m had worn clothes that matched some of the witness descriptions of the murderer, pointing especially to the small bag noted by a witness who saw the escaping assassin. Neither author presented any new testimony connecting Engstr√∂m to the crime, but Pettersson interviewed Olof Palme's son, M√•rten Palme, who was cited as saying that his observation of a man who appeared to take an interest in his parents shortly before the shooting bore a resemblance to Engstr√∂m. Critics of the Engstr√∂m theory retorted that M√•rten Palme had previously identified Christer Pettersson as that man; Pettersson and Engstr√∂m bore little resemblance to each other. In a separate 2018 interview, another witness, Lars J, who saw murderer's escape, said it was quite possible that Engstr√∂m was the man he saw running from the scene of the crime; however, he had not seen the man's face. Larsson's book drew little attention at the time of its publication, but Pettersson made a major splash and drew some acclaim. However, the theory also met with opposition. Skeptics argued that the idea of Engstr√∂m as a murder was far-fetched, in comparison with what they viewed as the more obvious alternative: Engstr√∂m was simply a confused witness with a penchant for exaggerating his own importance, and Palme's murderer remained unknown. In particular, family and friends of Engstr√∂m almost universally rejected the idea that he could have been a murderer, arguing that he had no reason to kill Palme, had never owned a gun, had no known criminal or extremist connections, and had no record of violence. Queried by investigators and by the press about the seeming discrepancies in Engstr√∂m's witness testimony, they pointed to a history of attention-seeking, a taste for \\"drama,\\" and a record of embellishing his own exploits to draw praise. \\"He was not a mythomaniac, but it was along those lines,\\" a childhood friend told Expressen. ==Named a murder suspect== On 10 June 2020, Engstr√∂m was announced as the prime suspect in the murder at a press conference by the Swedish Prosecuting Authority's investigator, Krister Petersson. The prosecutor explicitly denied having relied on the books by Lars Larsson and Thomas Pettersson, but presented a strikingly similar case description. The investigators' case rested on the fact that Engstr√∂m was known to have been on or near the scene of the crime, but had not been reliably identified as present after the shooting by any other witness; that his own account of events was deemed unreliable; and that his clothing bore a resemblance to that of the murderer. Petersson offered no motive for the killing, did not explain how or why Engstr√∂m had acquired a gun or why he would have carried it when leaving his office that night, and presented no witness identifying Engstr√∂m as the perpetrator. Although the prosecutor had previously claimed to have secured forensic evidence, he presented no such evidence at the press conference. It emerged that investigators had tracked down and test-fired a gun previously owned by an acquaintance of Engstr√∂m (a fact first revealed by author Thomas Pettersson), but that the results had been inconclusive. On the question of the weapon, Petersson simply stated that \\"considering what later transpires during the evening in question [i.e., that per Petersson's theory, Engstr√∂m shot Palme], we state he must have had a gun.\\" The only other forensic element of Petersson's investigation was the DNA-testing of a series of mysterious letters that had claimed responsibility for the murder; however, test results had shown that they had likely not been written by Engstr√∂m. Petersson noted that the evidence against Engstr√∂m would have been too circumstantial for a trial, but named him the prime suspect and said it would have been evidence enough to detain and question him, had he been alive. However, as Engstr√∂m was already deceased, Swedish police could not start a prosecution, and, consequently, the investigation was closed, 34 years after the murder. ==Reactions to the naming of Engstr√∂m== The prosecutor's announcement met with widespread criticism in Swedish media and from legal experts. Most critics focused on the absence of forensic evidence, charging that Petersson's case was made up of speculation and circumstantial evidence. Some also questioned the legality or propriety of publicly naming Engstr√∂m when even the prosecutor did not believe he had found evidence sufficient to convict him.Aftonbladet referred to the investigation's conclusion as \\"a total fiasco\\". Leif GW Persson, a professor emeritus of criminology, a long-time watcher of the Palme investigation, and an influential pundit on policing and crime issues, ridiculed Petersson's investigation as a \\"colossal disappointment\\" and said the case was so poorly construed that it might legally constitute defamation of Engstr√∂m. Engstr√∂m's family and friends were similarly critical. Legal professionals, including the Swedish Bar Association, demanded that a commission should be established to investigate Petersson's accusations, given that Engstr√∂m, being deceased, could not mount his own defense. According to a public opinion poll commissioned by Svenska Dagbladet, 19 percent of the Swedes believed that Engstr√∂m murdered Palme, meanwhile 62 percent answered that they were hesitant or did not know. Petersson responded to his critics in Expressen: \\"We have done our best, and, according to us, the investigation that we're presenting is rather strong.\\" == See also == *Christer Pettersson == References == Category:1934 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Olof Palme Category:People from Mumbai Category:Swedish printmakers Category:Suicides in Sweden ","title":"Stig Engstr√∂m (suspected murderer)"},{"id":"63948377","text":"Polat Kaya (born 6 January 1986), is a Turkish professional basketball player for Lokman Hekim Fethiye Belediyespor of the Turkish Basketbol S√ºper Ligi (BSL). == Career == In 2003, he started his professional career at Dar√º≈ü≈üafaka.

Her oratory and magic lantern slides taken on her travels made her a well-known lecturer in her time. ==Early life== McKnight was born the daughter of John Caulfield (1838-1919), a prosperous Irish immigrant in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and his wife Esther Egan (1844-1923). The oldest of seven children, she was educated at Sacred Heart Academy in Detroit and the \\"Harvard Annex\\" (soon to be Radcliffe College) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. At the Harvard Annex she studied art history with scholar Charles Eliot Norton, who encouraged her to study in Europe. In 1892 she left for Europe, where she studied with archaeologist Giovanni Battista de Rossi and spent four years travelling. ==Early lectures== One of McKnight's colored lantern slides: Jaffa Gate, 1910 Anna gave her first lectures after joining the Grand Rapids Ladies' Literary Club after her graduation from Sacred Heart Academy; friends suggested that she pursue lecturing as a career, and she went to the Harvard Annex with that in mind.https://www.lib.umich.edu/online- exhibits/exhibits/show/caulfield/anna-caulfield-mcknight \\"Anna Caulfield McKnight\\", An Artful Life: The Colored Lantern Slides of Anna Caulfield McKnight, Tori Cox, MLibrary Online Exhibits, 2018 In Europe she gave lectures and pursued material of interest, meeting with Pope Leo XIII for example (she later met Pope Benedict XV and Pope Pius XI). On her return to the United States, she lectured widely at institutions such as the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, the Chicago Art Institute, and Vassar College; her lecture at the French embassy in Washington, DC so impressed President William Howard Taft that he invited Anna and her mother to visit him at his summer home on Lake Champlain.

His ongoing work with Brad Troemel began at this time on the work The Jogging. The Jogging was begun in 2009 as a Tumblr blog on which thousands of strange images were put up. In 2017, Citarella continued his collaboration with Toemel, working with him on an Etsy art store called Ultra Violet Production House. As of January 2017, the two had put up seventy-eight works of art for sale, most of them made of everyday object in a manner that developed a sense of absurdity. For example, a couch covered in hardcore-punk-band patches and a bench built from two Apple computers with a plank of wood were put up for sale. In 2013, Citarella debuted with a series of five chromogenic still lifes at Higher Pictures. These prints included Body Anointed with Nitroglycerin Awaits Transfiguration, depicting a \\"reclining nude woman, partially covered in silver, with little flecks of skin and paint floating around her,\\" with some of the nitroglycerin smudging the frame. Andrew Russeth of The Observer describes the work as showing \\"exacting detail\\" instilling in viewers a \\"discomfort [that]...is also a sign that Mr. Citarella is closely attuned to the intricate traps of image production today.\\" Citarella presented his triptych SWIM A Few Years From Now at that Armory Show. It depict's his vision of a future \\"anarcho-capitalist\\" future America. Writing for Artsy, Scott Indrisek notes that the piece displays \\"a canny blend of analog photography and digital trickery, with many images borrowed from the internet... [it] has the slickness of a dystopian IKEA catalog spread.\\" As of 2017, Citarella was supporting himself with varied freelance and temporary jobs, including photography for New York galleries and editing for commercial images. Citarella has reworked aspects of his freelancing work into his own art pieces. ==References== Category:School of Visual Arts alumni Category:1987 births Category:Living people ","title":"Joshua Citarella"},{"id":"63948711","text":"Dummy Tappasu () is a 2015 Indian Tamil-language romantic-comedy film directed by O.

The line operates every 10‚Äì15 minutes daily and 20‚Äì30 minutes during late nights. Trips are roughly 45 minutes long. ==Background== Lafayette Square Route X2 operates daily between Minnesota Avenue station and Lafayette Square at all times running every 10‚Äì15 minutes during the day and 20‚Äì30 minutes during the late nights, providing service along H Street and Benning Road. There are select trips that operate during school hours from Phelps Architecture, Construction and Engineering High School and Friendship Collegiate Academy Public Charter School. One trip operates to Lafayette Square while four trips operate to Minnesota Avenue. Route X2 is one of the most heavily used bus routes with an average of 12,000 riders as of June 2016, behind the 16th Street Lines and 14th Street Lines. Ridership on the X2 has also been increasing due to development along the H Street and Benning Road corridor. Route X2 currently operates out of Bladensburg division. It is one of the few bus routes to utilize articulated buses. ==History== Route X2 operates under portions of former streetcar lines route 10 which operated under the Washington Railway & Electric Company. The line was created in 1871 which were powered by Horse Trolleys. The line was later run by electric cars by 1895 ad was electrified in 1899. The WR&E; was later acquired by Capital Traction Company to form the Capital Transit Company in 1936. The line was later converted into bus on May 1, 1949 which was renamed into route X2. Afterwards the DC Transit company took over operating buses along H Street and Benning Road. Then WMATA took over DC Transit on December 4, 1973 and incorporated the X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8, and X9. Route X1 operated between Minnesota Avenue station and Potomac Park via Washington Union Station and Louisiana Avenue. Route X2 operated between Minnesota Avenue and Union station. Route X3 operated between Minnesota Avenue and McLean Gardens. Route X4 was a new route introduced on November 24, 1978 operating between Minnesota Avenue and Lafayette Square. Route X5 was designated as \\"Owl Trips\\" operating between Seat Pleasant, Maryland and Lafayette Square. Route X6 would operate between Lafayette Square and Mayfair. All these routes mostly operate along Benning Road and H Street. ==Service Changes== Through the years, route X2 went to major service changes on its route. Routes X4, X5, and X7 discontinued during the years, X6 became the \\"National Arboretum Line\\" running between the United States National Arboretum and Washington Union Station in the 1990s, and X1 and X3 remains as the Benning Road Line where route X2 was split into the Benning Road-H Street Line. ===1981 Service Changes=== In January 1981, route X2 was extended to Capitol Heights station and X5 was shorten to Capitol Heights station. A new route X7 was created to operate on the old route X2 routing from 1978. ===1991 Service Changes=== On December 28, 1991, route X2 was shorten back to Minnesota Avenue station but was extended to Lafayette Square in order to replace routes X4, X5, X6, and X7. Service to Capitol Heights station from Minnesota Avenue was replaced by route U8. Route X2 was also split from the Benning Road Line and formed to the \\"Benning Road-H Street Line\\". Short trips are also operated between Minnesota Avenue station and Gallery Place station only during the weekdays. ===2017 Service Changes=== On June 25, 2017, route X2 was given a full 24/7 service due to earlier Metro closing during WMATA's FY2018 budget. At first, buses had a schedule gap of every 100 minutes between 2:30 and 4:10 am but now operates every 30 minutes. ===2017 Proposed Changes=== In 2017 during WMATA's FY2019 budget, WMATA proposed to eliminate route X2 short trips to Gallery Place station and operate the full route to Lafayette Square. However, the frequency of buses will be reduced from every 8 minutes to every 10‚Äì12 minutes. This was due to the full length route and to adjust the time between midday X2 buses and proposed midday service to route X9. It was also due to create a better balance of capacity and demand throughout the Benning Road and H Street corridor with the implementation of midday route X9, expanded limited-stop MetroExtra hours of service in Northeast, responds to requests by the District Department of Transportation, and provide the ability to add service to route X9 which would provide a weekday midday transfer-free ride throughout the entire corridor between downtown DC and Capitol Heights station. ===2018 Service Change=== On June 24, 2018, all route X2 trips operate between Minnesota Avenue station and Lafayette Square with short trips to Gallery Place station being discontinued. However the frequency of buses were increased from 8 minutes to 10‚Äì12 minutes. ==Incidents== Route X2 is notoriously infamous for having a high crime rate on its buses. The route suffers from many crimes and fare evasions on its buses. Fare evasion is also a major concern for WMATA on route X2 losing $700,000 from riders which is third in most fare evasions behind the W4 and 92. In 2015, X2 riders called out to WMATA to improve the crime rate on the buses as the crime rate was increasing on the buses. The Metro Board began all its best to slow the crime on the route with examples are installing surveillance video monitors, employing undercover police officers, and adding new driver shields on newer bus orders. Also in 2017, WMATA drivers, supervisors and Local 689 union members protested at WMATA for unsafe conditions on the job and for better protection on the X2. Route X2 has the highest crime rate on any Metrobus route comparing it to routes in Southeast but has the crime rate decreased after added protection in 2017. Incidents and accidents are listed below. * On June 23, 2013, an X2 bus driver and two female passengers got into an altercation where one of the female passengers reportedly threw a piece of paper at the driver and the driver hit the female passenger with \\"something sharp in his hands.\\" According to the victim, the X2 driver looked at Anderson inappropriately at the start of their ride and told the victim upon exiting, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let your male tendencies think you‚Äôre a man‚Äù; and subsequently stood up and attacked the victim with hate and violence, repeatedly punching her outside of the bus and fracturing a couple of her fingers. The victim would later file a lawsuit against WMATA in 2015. * On January 19, 2015, two men were shot inside an X2 bus after getting into an argument with another passenger between New Jersey Avenue and H Street NW. Bus camera footage shows the shooter exited the rear door of the bus and shot into the vehicle. The suspect was later arrested on January 21, 2015. * On March 30, 2015, a person threw a brick at an X2 bus windshield at 19th Street and Benning Road NE injuring two people on board. Later on April 29, 2015, three juveniles exited the bus and one of the members threw a rock at an X2 bus rear door, shattering one of the glass panels also at 19th Street and Benning Road NE, but no injuries were reported. The three juveniles were later arrested by DC Police. * On April 29, 2015, a man was arrested from an X2 bus after pulling out a knife to a woman after an argument they got into. * On May 15, 2015, police arrested a man after he a assaulted another passenger on board an X2 bus. * On November 12, 2015, an X2 bus and a DC Streetcar collided along H and 7th Streets NE. No injuries were reported. * On June 2, 2017, another collision occurred between an X2 bus and the DC Streetcar injuring 10 people. * On August 20, 2017, an X2 bus spun out of control and hit multiple cars and nearly hitting a building in Gallery Place. Seven people were injured. * On August 26, 2017, a woman was arrested after she threw a cup of urine at an X2 bus driver over the tone of the driver. After the incident, X2 drivers demand better protection on their buses due to its high crime rate and the lack of police presence on its buses. Drivers called out WMATA over the lack of protection for the X2 buses where passengers can easily get to the driver and cause disruptions to other passengers causing delays. * On October 4, 2017, a passenger was arrested after he pulled out a knife and threatened to kill the driver of an X2 bus over a disputed fare. The driver was unharmed. * On August 16, 2018, a white women got into a physical altercation with passengers after a video surfaced of the women saying the n-word on an X2 bus along 2nd and H streets. The lady was beaten up after she left the bus by passengers on the bus. Two suspects were questioned by Metro Transit Police but were not arrested. The women was sent to the hospital * On December 10, 2018, a teenager was caught hanging from the back of an X2 bus along Benning Road. No injuries were reported. ==References== X2 Category:Street railways in Washington, D.C.

The district was created under the 1916 Jones Law from the eastern Visayas provinces of Leyte and Samar. The district was represented by a total of six senators throughout its existence. It was abolished in 1935 when a unicameral National Assembly was installed under a new constitution following the passage of the Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act which established the Commonwealth of the Philippines.

It was released on November 18, 2014 on White's label No. 19 Music. == Critical reception == Critical reviews for Natural Selection were generally mixed. AllMusic's David Jeffries was very positive towards the album as a unique mixture of a \\"nocturnal and cool profile\\" with mainstream pop music elements such as \\"hip-hop-styled shouts and quirky lyrics.\\" As he stated in a nutshell, \\"Art Department shape all [their] influences into a sound that's entirely their own dream world, one where David Lynch, shoegaze, and dream pop are all touchstones, yet there's a youthful edge and their pointed, post-everything attitude is always ready to burst any pre-conceived bubbles.\\" Differently, Clash, while considering it a decent house album, felt it was too traditional of its style to elevate it above similar records. In less favorable reviews, the Las Vegas Weekly criticized Natural Selection for possibly being too alienating to mainstream electronic dance listeners, primarily due to \\"its menacing basslines boasting an edge rather than fluidity and Glasgow rendering his vocals so melancholic that it pushes AD‚Äôs post-millennial electronic forays further into dystopia.\\" musicOMH similarly summarized that, despite having the right \\"present and correct\\" sounds and structures, the album's potential was ruined by a lack of energy, where the listener feels \\"tired but not even being able to move to go to bed.\\" While Jeffries called Natural Selection an improvement over The Drawing Board and Renowned for Sound writer Mitchell Bozzetto claimed Art Department's mission towards a more \\"mature\\" sound \\"definitely pays off,\\" other critics found it inferior to the duo's debut. Tony Naylor of Resident Advisor dismissed Natural Selection as \\"a diffuse bunch of half-realised ideas,\\" stating it was a far less \\"definitive statement\\" than The Drawing Board; in his opinion, it replaced the \\"devastatingly simple\\" pop house style of the prior album with \\"weak stylistic shifts,\\" \\"banal collaborations,\\" \\"pointless interludes,\\" and a more limited use of Glasgow's singing. Nows Benjamin Boles was more appreciative of the group's move from a less danceable style to something more experimental; however, he still thought The Drawing Board was more of a \\"big impression\\" and that Natural Selections risks \\"sometimes pay off but lead to mixed results overall\\"; he claimed the album worked best \\"when [the duo] let their experimental impulses coexist with their pop instincts.\\" == References == Category:2014 albums Category:Electronic albums by Canadian artists ","title":"Natural Selection (Art Department album)"},{"id":"63948776","text":"Cheilosia sahlbergi is a Palearctic hoverfly. ==Description== One of the Cheilosia species with bare eyes, black legs and fused antennal pits.

Simon, \\"Rutten (Martin-Hubert)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 31 (Brussels, 1961), 659-664. He was ordained to the priesthood on 28 April 1867, and taught mathematics at the minor seminary of Saint-Roch (Ferneres) from 1868, becoming director of the school in 1873. In 1875 he was appointed an honorary canon, in 1878 rector of the minor seminary in Sint- Truiden, and in 1879 president of the diocesan seminary and vicar general of the diocese of Li√®ge. In 1888 he became dean of the cathedral chapter in Li√®ge, and on 26 August 1901 was named bishop. His appointment was supported by Leopold II of Belgium, who saw him as a man who would combat the growth of Christian democracy in Li√®ge. Unlike his predecessor, he was opposed to the extension of the franchise, and thought nobody under 30 should be allowed to vote. He was consecrated on 6 June 1902. Rutten was from a Dutch-speaking family and inclined to Flamingant ideas, thinking it a matter of pressing importance that ordinary people receive instruction in so far as possible in their native language. During the First School War he interpreted live for Jean-Joseph Thonissen at a political rally in Limburg. He published two articles in Het Belfort, in 1887 and 1892, as well as addressing the Eucharistic Congress held at Hasselt in 1904 in Dutch. He protested against German atrocities and exactions during the German occupation of Belgium during World War I and condemned those who collaborated to obtain language concessions, but immediately after the end of the war he decreed that the Catholic secondary schools in Limburg should switch to Dutch as the main medium of instruction. On 16 November 1925, Eupen and Malmedy were removed from the Archdiocese of Cologne and attached to the diocese of Li√®ge. He died in Li√®ge on 17 July 1927. Over the course of his episcopate he had consecrated 120 churches and 24 chapels, to bring the sacraments as close to the people as possible. ==References== Category:1841 births Category:1927 deaths Category:People from Limburg (Belgium) Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Bishops of Li√®ge ","title":"Martin-Hubert Rutten"},{"id":"63948885","text":"Rhizopogon amylopogon is a sub-genus of Rhizopogon containing seven species. * R. brunsii * R. arctostaphyli * R. kretzerae * R. salebrosus * R. pinyonensis * R. ellenae * R. subpurpurascens Sub-genus Amylopogon are ectomycorrhizal fungi categorized as monotropoid mycorrhiza.Smith SE, Read DJ (1997) Mycorrhizal symbiosis, 2nd edn.

He was a member of the Philadelphia City Council and served as Pennsylvania Auditor General and Pennsylvania Treasurer. He was also the chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. ==Biography== Thomas Minehart was born on May 23, 1907 to John Minehart and Elizabeth Cosgrove Minehart. He graduated from Temple University and Temple University School of Law. He was from a politically active family. His father had been a member of the City Council and his uncle, Thomas Z. Minehart, served as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1907 to 1908. In 1936, Minehart was elected to the Philadelphia City Council for the 6th district. Following the reorganization of the City Council in the 1919 city charter, Minehart was the only Democrat on the city council throughout his one term at City Hall. In 1942, he ran for the United States House of Representatives against Hugh Scott, but was defeated taking only 44% of the vote. After his defeat, he served as an attorney in the Office of Price Administration. Minehart later moved to Fort Washington in Montgomery County and continued his law practice after leaving government. In 1960, defeated Robert F. Kent a state representative from Crawford County in a race for Pennsylvania Auditor General. As auditor, he initiated audits of the suburban counties of Philadelphia and later clashed with Governor William Scranton after the latter took office and fired 32 Democrats from state offices. He later declined to approve a purchase of draperies that the governor ordered for a reception. In 1964, Minehart was term limited and ran for Pennsylvania Treasurer against Robert D. Fleming a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate from Pittsburgh.With the landslide victory in the 1964 presidential election, Minehart had little trouble in dispatching his opponent by 542,000 votes. In 1966, Minehart supported Bob Casey Sr. in the 1966 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election who was defeated by Milton Shapp; but defeated Shapp's preferred candidate, Robert P. Kane, for chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. As chairman, Minehart clashed with Democrats seeking reform around nomination rules after Hubert Humphrey was awarded the majority of delegates by the party even though Eugene McCarthy won the majority of votes in the Pennsylvania primary election. Minehart stepped down as auditor and offered to lead a reform commission as the state chairman. He appointed a commission to reform the rules; however, the committee met only twice and had one public hearing before the committee was effectively shut down, leading to charges that Minehart had double-crossed the party members who supported his election. Meinhart died on July 29, 1989 in Reading, Pennsylvania from heart failure. ==References== - Category:1907 births Category:1989 deaths Category:Philadelphia City Council members Category:Pennsylvania Auditors General Category:Pennsylvania Democrats Category:Politicians from Philadelphia Category:State treasurers of Pennsylvania Category:State cabinet secretaries of Pennsylvania Category:Temple University alumni ","title":"Thomas Z.

William Verity came from a metalworking family. He began as a whitesmith, then a fitter and began a building bikes which became a motor garage in Manchester. == Education == Verity attended Manchester Central High School and at 16 she left school and began learning engineering from her father. He had already taught her to drive when she was 13. By the time she was 14, Verity was teaching driving. On her sixteenth birthday in 1910, she was sent by her father to drive a car back from London to Manchester (well over 200 miles), accompanied by a garage employee who had been instructed that she was to drive the entire way herself. Verity went to the Manchester College of Technology and Manchester High School of Commerce where she took courses in automobile engineering. == First World War == When the First World War began Verity began working as a driving instructor for the military, ultimately teaching hundreds of men to drive. She was also part of the Curios concert party, organising entertainment for troops in the evenings. She taught at Ministry of Pensions‚Äô driving scheme for service men who had shell shock. == Verity's Garage == After the war Verity worked in the motor garage and when her father died she took it over for good in 1925. The garage was Verity's University Garage and Motor School. She undertook much of the motor repair work herself, and developed and ran a Driving School under the Royal Automobile Club's scheme. She appointed her cousin Clifford Luke as her foreman and manager and her workforce of \\"my boys\\" were loyal and long term employees. 1950s adverts for Verity's offered repairs, new and used cars, driving lessons and motor insurance and promoted their agency for Renault cars at 1001-107 Lloyd Street North, near Victoria University. Verity joined the Institute of the Motor Trade in 1927. She was an active member of the organisation, chair of the North West region branch and often as the only woman at events. In 1930 Verity was awarded the Institute of Motor Trades Wakefield Gold Medal, endowed by Castrol Oil founder Sir Charles Wakefield. She was given it for the best paper any motoring subject entitled What are the benefits of price maintenance?. The outbreak of the Second World War caused her to get back into training drivers for the armed forces and emergency services. She taught mechanical and repair theory at a lecture theatre in her garage. Verity was also in the Civil Defense. She also spoke at the Manchester Gas Showrooms Warfare cookery demonstrations. == Memberships == Verity became the first female Fellow of the Institute of the Motor Trade. She remained active even after closing the garage. She was also a member of the Manchester Soroptimists‚Äô women's group where she was an active vice-chairwoman in 1931, captaining a cricket team playing against the Liverpool Soroptimists. She joined the Women's Engineering Society in 1939 and was chair of the Manchester branch before going on to be Vice-President of the Society in 1947‚Äì8. She turned down the Presidency as it coincided with the compulsory purchase of her garage property for the expansion of Manchester University, when she had to rebuild her business. Verity made regular donations in support of the organisation and was advertised her garage in The Woman Engineer journal for over 20 years. == Personal life == Verity lived with her cousin Emily ‚ÄúEm\\" Verity MBE, physics teacher and head of science at Withington Girls‚Äô School, and died on 9 June 1971.

His most famous song is \\"Forgotten Times\\" (). == Life == === Folk style singer and songwriter === Chen Hung-ming lived in Penghu up to age seven, when he moved to Taipei. During his third year of high school, Chen and two of his classmates participated in 1978 first Folk Style () competition at store. They called themselves the Little Crow Trio (), and they performed their original composition \\"Goodbye Clouds\\" (). They ranked in the competition and thereafter gained recognition by Haishan Records and became a campus folk band. Little Crow recorded their songs into the Folk Style () album series. They also provided backup vocals for Haishan Records artist Liu Chia-ling (). Chen‚Äôs works were also performed by other singers and included in the Folk Style series compilation albums. Several of his songs, including \\"Forgotten Times\\" and a song that is literally translated as \\"Morning Book\\" (), were recorded in the debut album Farewell My Country () by Tsai Chin, who competed in the second Folk Style competition. === Later developments === Chen graduated from the Radio and Television Division of what is now Shih Hsin University. At this point he returned home looking for a stable job, and after being discharged from his military service, he joined the Taiwan Police College and served as a police officer. Because he was often assigned to handle jobs related to music, he realized that he desired to do music for a living and thereafter quit his police job. In 1993, he joined with Pao Chih-ching () to create the Little Crow and Wild Dove () duet, with whom he published one album. In about 2006, with the encouragement of Lee Ming-yang (), he started writing Taiwanese Hokkien songs. Since then, he has written at least 200 such songs. After the movie Internal Affairs (), which included his song \\"Forgotten Times,\\" aired, the production company sent him a DVD of the film. Upon hearing his music, he reminisced on old times, and around 2010 he moved back to Penghu. There, he started a coffee shop and Judao Music Corporation (), and he resumed his musical activities. In 2015, he wrote the song \\"Taiwan is Our Name\\" () for the Kuomintang presidential nominee Hung Hsiu-chu. == The Song \\"Forgotten Times\\" == When he was writing \\"Forgotten Times,\\" Chen Hung-ming was only a high school junior. He was learning English at the time and reminiscing on his time living in Penghu as a young child. Because it seldom rained in Penghu, his happiest memory from childhood was hearing the sound of rain dripping on glass. It happened that at this time he had a guitar nearby, and he thereupon wrote this song. He originally planned to call the song \\"Who is Tapping on My Window\\" (). After hearing Chen sing this song in the performance hall at the Folk Style competition, Tsai Chin expressed her interest in singing the song. She recorded this song in her 1980 personal album Farewell My Country. The 2002 film Infernal Affairs set off a craze for this song, and the French version of it was thereafter used in the 2008 film Flight of the Red Balloon by director Hou Hsiao-hsien. == Works == * \\"Goodbye Clouds,\\" which he recorded in 1978 into the Folk Style and for which he was the principal singer * \\"Forgotten Time,\\" which was recorded by Tsai Chin in 1980 in the album Farewell My Country * \\"Dewdrop\\" (),\\" which was recorded by in the album Your hands are so cold () * \\"Calling to You\\" (), which was recorded by in the album Lost Dream () * \\"I Love you Taiwan\\" (), which was recorded by Chris Hung in the album Good Luck Man () == See Also == * Campus folk song == Notes == == References == Category:Taiwanese composers Category:Taiwanese lyricists Category:Taiwanese police officers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Taiwanese singer-songwriters Category:People from Penghu County Category:Shih Hsin University alumni ","title":"Chen Hung-ming"},{"id":"63949191","text":"Mary Gibson Hundley (18 October 1897 ‚Äì 1986) was an educator and civil rights activist from Baltimore, Maryland. She was born to lawyer Malachi Gibson and teacher Mary Matilda Syphax. Through her mother's side of the family, she is a descendant of Martha Washington and the granddaughter of William Syphax, the namesake of the William Syphax School in Washington D.C. She is also a relative of Douglas Syphax, a Union army officer during the American Civil War. == Background == Mary Gibson Hundley was born on October 18, 1897 in Baltimore Maryland. She graduated from the \\"M\\" Street School (now known as Dunbar High School) in Washington D.C. in 1914. After high school, she attended Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts where she majored in English and was active in her college theatre productions. After she graduated cum laude in 1918, she went on to pursue her masters in French at Middleburry College and the Sorbonne in Paris, France. == Work and Activism == Hundley taught for two years in Baltimore before moving back to Washington D.C. where she taught English, French, and Latin at Dunbar High School from 1920‚Äì1954. She also taught part-time at Miner Teacher's College from 1931‚Äì1932. While at Dunbar, she was chairman of the College Bureau from 1943‚Äì1949, a member of the Guidance Committee, and she organized after-school enrichment programs for students. From 1955‚Äì1959, she taught English and Latin at Eastern High School, and from 1959‚Äì1964, she taught at Howard University. After leaving Howard, she continued her career in education through tutoring students in French. In 1965, she published the book The Dunbar Story, 1870-1955, in which she tells the story of Dunbar High School as the first preparatory school for Blacks in the United States. In January 1941, the Hundleys purchased and moved into a house in a neighborhood with a restrictive racial covenant. Their white neighbors brought a legal suit against them and won in December of the same year. The Hundleys were encouraged to refrain from living in their house, and they were eventually evicted in July 1942. The case was later reversed by appeal one year after its initial decision. The case was later cited in the Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 US1-23 (1948) case, which established that covenants restricting use and ownership of property to whites violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. ==Personal Life== Hundley was married first to William M. Brewer. The two divorced in 1935. She married again in 1938, this time to Frederick F. Hundley , a public school art teacher. He died in 1955. Hundley was also a participant in a number of women's organizations, and was a member in the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, The Links, the Women's Auxiliary of the Freedmen's Hospital (now Howard University Hospital), the Radcliffe Club of Washington, and the American Association of University Women. She also volunteered with a variety of institutions, offering herself as an escort and interpreter for foreign visitors via a number of organizations in Washington D.C. and a tour leader for the National Education Association. In 1978, Hundley was honored by Radcliffe College at its Centennial Awards ceremony with the Alumnae Recognition Award for her career as an educator and courageous citizen. ==Death and Legacy== Mary Gibson Hundley died in 1986.

Sprucidea species are found in rainforest areas in South America and Southeast Asia. ==Taxonomy== Sprucidea was circumscribed in 2017 by lichenologists Marcela C√°ceres, Andr√© Aptroot, and Robert L√ºcking. S. granulosa and the type species, S. rubropenicillata, were described as new to science, while S. gymnopiperis and S. penicillata were two proposed new combinations from the genera Malmidea and Bacidina, respectively. ==Description== Sprucidea lichens are corticolous species that inhabit tropical rainforests. They have a crustose thallus, with or without isidia. The hypothallus and to a lesser extent other parts are often coloured with the red pigment norsolorinone. Apothecia are sessile, often becoming convex in shape. The ascospores are rod-shaped (bacillary), and hyaline.

R. salebrosus is a monotropoid mycorrhiza that is of vital importance to the ecology of conifer forests, especially in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. Although it is native to North America, R. salebrosus has been found in Europe and its range is generally limited to mountainous regions with sufficient precipitation. The mycoheterotrophic plant, Pterospora andromedea is often found in an obligate association with R. salebrosus in western parts of the U.S. Eastern populations of P. andromedea are typically symbiotic with another Rhizopogon sub species, R. kretzerae. Rhizopogon sp. from Sierra de Valdemeca, Cuenca, Spain Species that form these mycoheterotrophic relationships like P. andromedea and R. salebrosus benefit one other by sharing essential nutrients. For example, ectomychorrizal plants contribute up to 30% of their fixed carbon in exchange for nitrogen that their host fungi absorb from the soil. Mycoheterotrophic plants can only be found in the tropics, though several members from Ericaceae and Orchidaceae do occur in temperate forests. These unique mycoheterotrophic associations are thought to have evolved due to low light availability on the forest floor. Competition among ectomycorrhizal species plays an influential role in the composition and distribution of Rhizopogon species and the plants they associate with. Abiotic factors such as soil chemistry and soil moisture affect ectomychorrizal assemblages, however much less is known about the biotic factors that determine their composition other than host specificity. One study compared the competitive advantage between Rhizopogon salebrosus and Rhizopogon occidentalis. Each Rhizopogon species was introduced to Pinus muricata seedlings and the root tip biomass of each species was determined every few months. This was possible because a number of seedlings were planted in microcosms with only R. salebrosus, only R. occidentalis, or both R. salebrosus and R. occidentalis and grown under the same conditions. Some seedlings were then harvested every 2 months, the soil was rinsed from the root mass, and then the percentage of fungal occupation of their roots was determined using molecular sequencing. They found that R. occidentalis had similar root tip biomass when grown alone or in the presence of R. salebrosus. However, R. salebrosus had significantly less root tip biomass when grown in the presence of R. occidentalis than when grown alone, indicating it as a competitive inferior. Another study involving the same two Rhizopogon species examined the beneficial effects they imparted to their host plant. They found no significant difference in growth, survival, or percentage leaf nitrogen of seedlings colonized with either R. salebrosus or R. occidentalis. However, plants inoculated with both ectomychorrizal species showed significantly higher growth and percent leaf nitrogen compared to seedlings without ectomychorrizal fungus. Another interesting aspect of ectomycorrhizal competition are the strategies used to persist over long periods and colonize during unfavorable conditions such as drought or wildfire. Fungi are able to disperse and propagate with the help of spores and sclerotia which are able to remain dormant in the soil for some time, although their longevity is not well understood. In one a study the viability of fungal propagules was tested by collecting soil samples from the forest and aging them for six years. While the colonization rate was low, R. salebrosus was identified as a species able to survive in the soil for at least six years. Distribution of species is a prevalent topic, especially as climate change continues to alter forest ecosystems. Within the Deschutes National Forest, Oregon, USA, the historic range of Pinus contorta is steadily changing due to increasing temperatures and drought, declines in winter precipitation and snowpack. These environmental changes may have facilitated the migration of Pinus ponderosa into P. contorta territory. Observations such as these have led to studies examining the relationship between pine species distribution and how they are aided through the fungal composition of the soil. Is has been confirmed that R. salebrosus is one of the dominant fungal symbionts in both P. contorta and P. ponderosa. These findings indicate that the successful migration of pine species may be influenced by the previous distribution or co-migration of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Fire is known to significantly reduce biomass and diversity of ectomychorrizal fungi. Though some species are more persistent than others. One study found that R. salebrosus was present in the soil before and after prescribed burning, suggesting that it is able to survive or re- establish quickly after a disturbance such as fire. Rhizopogon kretzerae is another ectomycorrhizal fungus under the Rhizopogon sub-genus Amylopogon. R. kretzerae are similar to R. salebrosus in that they form obligate symbiotic relationships with Pterospora andromedea, however these associations are usually only observed in eastern populations. Like other members of the sub- genus Amylopogon, R. kretzerae is known to act as a mycobiont host to the parasitic plant P. andromedea and grow under members of Pinaceae, however it has only ever been found associated with Pinus strobus or the eastern white pine. In recent years there has been a noticeable decline in eastern populations of P. andromedea likely due to human impact. Conservation management efforts are being made by examining the genetics of P. andromedea's preferred eastern fungal symbiont, R. kretzerae. In many cases, mycoheterotrophic plants and mycorrhizal fungal relationships are so specific that seedling recruitment is not possible in the absence of their key fungal symbiont. Close relatives of the host fungi are sometimes able to trigger germination, though survivorship is low. ==See also== *Pterospora andromedea Woodland Pinedrops, Mt.

Kerrigan had been practicing skating on an ice rink in the arena shortly beforehand. The attack was planned by fellow American figure skater Tonya Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and his co-conspirator Shawn Eckardt. They hired Stant, and his uncle Derrick Smith, to carry out the attack. Gillooly and Eckardt both claimed Harding was involved in the attack and had knowledge of it beforehand. Harding denied any involvement in, or knowledge of, the attack, despite Gillooly and Eckardt's claims. The attack was intended to prevent Kerrigan from taking part in the ongoing 1994 United States Figure Skating Championships and the upcoming Winter Olympics, thus increasing the prospects of Harding in both figure skating events. Kerrigan could not compete in the US Championship but recovered in time to compete in the Winter Olympics. Both Kerrigan and Harding competed in the Olympics, but Harding was later banned for life from United States Figure Skating Association (USFSA) figure skating events. ==Background== Nancy Kerrigan is an American former figure skater who, in January 1994, was about to take part in the United States Figure Skating Championships in Detroit, Michigan. Her main rival in that tournament was Tonya Harding. The attack took place just days before the tournament, and rendered Kerrigan unable to take part. The Winter Olympics were also set to take place in February, where Kerrigan and Harding were likely to be the two female figure skaters representing the United States. The attack benefited Harding as it allowed her to win the U.S. Championships with ease, and could have benefited her if it had taken Kerrigan out of the Olympics. Jeff Gillooly was Tonya Harding's ex-husband. At the time of the attack, the couple were together and still referred to each other as husband and wife. Shawn Eckardt, a friend of Gillooly's who was also Harding's bodyguard before the attack, had been hired by the figure skater after she received anonymous death threats. Derrick Smith, an associate of Eckardt, was paid $6500 to carry out the attack; Eckardt had received the money from Gillooly. Shane Stant, Smith's nephew, initially planned to carry out the attack by himself and had travelled to Kerrigan's home rink in Cape Cod in late December 1993, but was unable to locate her. Stant then followed Kerrigan to the Nationals in Detroit in early January 1994. Gillooly opposed carrying out an attack in Detroit, feeling it too likely they would be caught, and instructed Eckardt to wire Stant funds to return home without carrying out the attack. Eckardt instead wired the funds to Smith, who then traveled to join Stant in Detroit. Stant and Smith then planned to carry out the attack together. ==Attack== Kerrigan was practicing for the U.S. Championships on an ice rink inside Cobo Arena. A camera crew was recording her practice session and showed her leaving the ice rink and walking through a curtain and down a hallway; the camera then cuts out. Stant stated in a 2018 interview that he was standing \\"about a foot and a half\\" (around half a meter) behind the camera crew and waited for them to stop filming before he followed Kerrigan through the curtain. Stant approached Kerrigan from behind, extended a telescopic baton, struck her lower right thigh and walked away. He then escaped from the arena by smashing through a locked glass door. Smith was waiting in a car outside and acted as a getaway driver. The camera crew began recording again shortly after the attack and recorded Kerrigan sitting on the floor crying surrounded by arena staff. Here, Kerrigan exclaimed the famous line, \\"Why? Why? Why?\\" This footage was later broadcast around the world in news programs. Kerrigan was then carried away to a changing room by her father. ==Aftermath== ===Immediate aftermath=== Harding's practice sessions at Clackamas Town Center, in preparation for the 1994 Winter Olympics, were attended by thousands of spectators and dozens of reporters and film crews. On January 11, Ann Schatz interviewed Harding for KOIN-TV in Portland, Oregon. Schatz asked if she had considered whether someone she knew had planned to attack Nancy. Harding answered, \\"I have definitely thought about it. No one controls my life but me...if there's something in there that I don't like, I'm going to change it.\\"Ann Schatz's 1994 interview with Tonya Harding at KOIN. KOIN 6. January 11, 1994 Excerpt of Tonya Harding claiming that she doesn't know how Nancy Kerrigan came to be attacked from 0:56 Harding also confirmed she had spoken with FBI agents in Detroit and again in Portland. On January 13, Eckardt and Smith were arrested. On January 14, the United States Figure Skating Association (USFSA) made a statement on whether Eckardt's arrest affected Harding's Olympic placement: \\"We will deal only with the facts.\\" Harding and Gillooly's separate lawyers confirmed the couple were in daily contact and cooperation with law enforcement. On January 15, Harding and Gillooly spoke with reporters, but declined to comment about the investigation. On January 16, Harding's lawyer held a news conference in which he read statement denying Harding's involvement in the attack on Kerrigan. Harding left her home that evening to practice figure skating with her coaches, where she spoke with reporters and performed a triple Axel. ===USFSA disciplinary panel=== On February 5, 1994, the disciplinary panel of the USFSA stated reasonable grounds existed to believe Harding had violated the sport's code of ethics. Harding's admitted failure to report about an assault on a fellow competitor, supported by her FBI transcripts, led to her being formally charged with \\"[making] false statements about her knowledge\\". The USFSA also recommended that she face a disciplinary hearing. Claire Ferguson, president of the USFSA, decided not to suspend Harding's membership before a hearing took place. If she had been suspended, she likely still would have competed at the Olympics after filing suit, seeking an injunction against the USFSA, and asserting her rights under the Amateur Sports Act of 1978. The panel examined evidence including the testimonies of Stant and Smith, Harding and Gillooly's telephone records, and notes found in a Portland saloon trash bin on January 30. Harding was given thirty days to respond. ===Grand jury indictment=== Harding arriving at Portland International Airport amid a crush of reporters after the 1994 Olympics. On March 21, 1994, a Portland grand jury issued an indictment stating there was evidence Harding participated in the attack plot. The indictment concluded more than two months of investigation and witness testimonies from Diane Rawlinson; Harding's choreographer Erika Bakacs; freelance figure skating writer Vera Marano; and Eckardt's college instructor and classmates. It stated there was evidence Harding fraudulently used USFSA- provided skating monies to finance the assault. It also read that Harding, Gillooly, Eckardt, Smith, and Stant agreed to \\"knowingly cause physical injury...by means of a dangerous weapon.\\" The grand jury foreman said the evidence implied Harding as \\"involved from the beginning or very close.\\" She was not charged in the indictment due to the terms of her March 16 plea agreement. ===Sentences=== On February 1, 1995, Gillooly's attorney negotiated a plea agreement in exchange for testimony regarding all involved parties in the attack. In July, he was sentenced to two years in prison after publicly apologizing to Kerrigan ‚Äì even though, he said, \\"any apology coming from me rings hollow.\\" Gillooly and Eckardt pleaded guilty to racketeering, while Stant and Smith pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit second-degree assault. Judge Donald Londer noted the attack could have injured Kerrigan more seriously. Eckardt died in 2007. On March 16, Harding pleaded guilty to conspiracy to hinder prosecution as a Class C felony offense at a Multnomah County court hearing. She and her lawyer, Robert Weaver, negotiated a plea agreement ensuring no further prosecution. Judge Londer conducted routine questioning to make certain Harding understood her agreement, that she was entering her plea \\"knowingly and voluntarily.\\" Harding told Londer she was. Her plea admissions were knowing of the assault plot after the fact, settling on a cover story with Gillooly and Eckardt on January 10, witnessing payphone calls to Smith affirming the story on January 10 and 11, and lying to FBI. Law enforcement investigators had been following and videotaping the co- conspirators since January 10; they knew about the payphone calls. Harding's penalties included three years of probation, $100,000 fine, and 500 hours community service. She agreed to reimburse Multnomah County $10,000 in legal expenses, undergo a psychiatric examination, and volunteered to give $50,000 to the Special Olympics Oregon (SOOR) charity. Oregon sentencing guidelines carried a max penalty of five years imprisonment for the offense. ===Second disciplinary panel meeting=== On June 29, the USFSA disciplinary panel met for nine hours over two days to consider Harding's alleged role in the attack. On June 30, chairman William Hybl stated, \\"By a preponderance of the evidence, the panel did conclude that she had prior knowledge and was involved prior to the incident. This is based on civil standards, not criminal standards...bank records, phone records ‚Äì the way they came together to establish a case.\\" The panel decided that pertinent FBI reports, court documents, and Harding's March 16 plea agreement presented \\"a clear disregard for fairness, good sportsmanship, and ethical behaviour.\\" Harding chose neither to attend nor participate in the two-day hearing. Weaver said the decision disappointed her but was not a surprise, and that she had not decided on an appeal. Harding was stripped of the 1994 U.S. Championship title and banned for life from participating in USFSA events as either skater or coach. The USFSA has no dominion over professional skating events, yet Harding was also persona non grata on the pro circuit. Few skaters and promoters would work with her, and she did not benefit from the ensuing boom in professional skating after the scandal. ==In popular culture== The attack and the scandal surrounding it was depicted in the 2017 film I, Tonya with Margot Robbie playing Harding, Ricky Russert playing Stant, and Caitlin Carver playing Kerrigan. The attack was mentioned in Weird Al Yankovic‚Äôs song \\"Headline News\\", a parody of the Crash Test Dummies hit \\"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\\". ==Notes== ==References== Category:1994 in Detroit Category:Attacks in the United States in 1994 Category:Figure skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics Category:Sports scandals in the United States Category:1994 scandals ","title":"1994 Cobo Arena attack"},{"id":"63949936","text":"Guo Liang Chi (, born 1966), also known in Cantonese as Kwok Lung-kee or Kwok Ling-kay and his nickname Ah Kay, is a Chinese criminal who was charged and convicted by US federal authorities for murder and human trafficking.

In 1825, he donated a mummy and coffin he acquired from the Thedenat-Duvent sale, to the Berlin Museum. In February and March 1865, ten years after his death, his collection was auctioned off in Paris in accordance with his will. The majority of his collection was photographed and published in a large folio catalog by Goupil & Cie. The Laughing Cavalier was purchased by Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford (who outbid Baron James Mayer de Rothschild). William Tyssen-Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney bought some of the important Egyptian objects. Sir Charles Thomas Newton spent 60,919 francs on bronzes and vases for the British Museum, and 47,000 francs on Giustiniani's Apollo. ==Collection== ;Paintings File:Cavalier soldier Hals-1624x.jpgLaughing Cavalier by Frans Hals File:Agnolo Bronzino - Portrait of a Young Man.jpgPortrait of a Young Man with a Book by Agnolo Bronzino, 1540 File:Saint Philip Neri (1515‚Äì1595) MET DP-944-001.jpgSaint Philip Neri, by Carlo Dolci, File:Fra Angelico - The Healing of Palladia by Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian - WGA00511.jpg\\"The Healing of Palladia by Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian\\", by Fra Angelico, ‚Äì1440 File:Sandro Botticelli, Portrait of a Youth, c. 1482-1485, NGA 21.jpgPortrait of a Youth. by Sandro Botticelli, ‚Äì1485 File:Workshop of Titian, Allegory of Love, c. 1520-1540, NGA 400.jpgAllegory of Love, by the Workshop of Titian, ‚Äì1540 File:Quentin Massys, Ill-Matched Lovers, c. 1520-1525, NGA 52622.jpgIll-Matched Lovers, by Quentin Massys, ‚Äì1525 File:Rembrandt van Rijn (and Workshop?), The Apostle Paul, c. 1657, NGA 1198.jpgThe Apostle Paul, by Rembrandt van Rijn, File:Dosso DOSSI , Battista DOSSI (attributed to) - Lucrezia Borgia, Duchess of Ferrara - Google Art Project.jpgLucrezia Borgia, Duchess of Ferrara, by Battista Dossi, ‚Äì1530 File:The Landscape Painter.JPG\\"The Landscape Painter\\" by Fran√ßois Boucher File:Leyden Bearing of the Cross.jpgBearing of the Cross with St. Veronica, by Lucas van Leyden, File:Henri d'Albret (1503‚Äì55), King of Navarre MET DT572.jpgHenri d'Albret King of Navarre, by L√©onard Limousin, 1556 File:Anne de Pisseleu (1508‚Äì1576), Duchesse d'√âtampes MET DP102428.jpgAnne de Pisseleu Duchesse d'√âtampes, by Corneille de Lyon, ‚Äì40 ;Sculpture and pottery File:Head Apollo BM Sc1547.jpgHead of Apollo, that was once in the collection of Vincenzo Giustiniani, Roman copy of ‚Äì140 File:Hera Borghese N4525.jpgHead of the Borghese Hera File:Bronze Apollon Louvre Br522.jpgApollo, holding his (lost) bow in the right hand and a (lost) laurel branch in the left hand File:Mercury tortoise Louvre Br184.jpgMercury, holding a lost object, probably a tortoise, 1st century BC File:Stele of Jason BM 1865.1-3.3.jpgFunerary stele of Jason, BC File:Sacrifice √† D√©m√©ter et Core (Louvre, Ma 752).jpgSacrifice to Demeter (Ceres) and Core (Proserpine), ‚Äì320 BC File:Death Actaeon BM VaseF176.jpgActaeon attacked by his hounds by Dolon Painter File:Dionysos kantharos Louvre CA2981-2984.jpgDionysos holding a kantharos, ‚Äì480 BC File:Dionysos Ploutos BM F68.jpgDionysos and Ploutos surrounded by satyrs and maenads, ‚Äì360 BC File:Thetis Peleus Louvre G373.jpgPeleus wrestling Thetis and holding her as she transforms into a snake, BC File:Xanthias Heracles BM VaseF233.jpgThe actor Xanthias, standing next to a statuette of Heracles, ‚Äì340 BC File:Zeus Louvre G204.jpgZeus wielding the thunderbolt in his right hand, ‚Äì470 BC File:Dish- The Destruction of the Hosts of Pharaoh MET SLP1232-1.jpg\\"The Destruction of the Hosts of Pharaoh\\" (front), by Jacques Courtois, early 17th century File:Dish- The Destruction of the Hosts of Pharaoh MET SLP1232-2.jpg\\"The Destruction of the Hosts of Pharaoh\\" (back), by Jacques Courtois, early 17th century File:Dish with Achelous and Theseus MET DP326942.jpgDish with Achelous and Theseus, by Maestro Domenego da Venezia, ‚Äì70 ==References== ;Sources ;Further reading *Pourtal√®s-Gorgier.

Political scientist Carolyn Hendriks noted the organisation mobilised \\"disgruntled citizens\\" through an innovative linking of informal political participation to the formal political system of parliament. Voices for Indi uses the colour green while the endorsed independents use the colour orange, in order \\"to delineate its participatory work\\" from the parliamentarians. ==History== Voices for Indi was established in 2012 following the incumbent Liberal MP Sophie Mirabella rejecting a proposal for greater democratic participation, stating \\"the people of Indi aren't interested in politics\\". The organisation established informal forms of participatory democracy by setting up \\"kitchen table conversations\\" and using campaign offices as community 'hubs' for political discussion. Voices For Indi gained notoriety after the 2013 Australian federal election, when independent Cathy McGowan unseated Mirabella with its support. The organisation inspired the establishment of Voices of Warringah in 2018, who later endorsed the independent Zali Steggall for the Division of Warringah. Zali Steggall defeated the incumbent member of Warringah and ex-Prime Minister Tony Abbott in the 2019 Australian federal election.

The line runs every 24‚Äì30 minutes on weekdays and 30-35 minutes on weekends. Trips take roughly 45-50 minutes. ==Background== Routes V2 and V4 provide service between Capitol Heights station and Anacostia station or Navy Yard‚ÄìBallpark station. Route V2 operates Monday through Saturday with no Sunday service while route V4 operates daily service. These routes connect Northeast residents to Southeast from Benning Heights. Routes V2 and V4 operate out of Southern Avenue division on weekdays and Shepherd Parkway on weekends and select weekday peak hour trips. ==History== Routes V2 originally operated by the Washington Railway & Electric Company under the Capitol Heights‚ÄìAnacostia Line running between Capitol Heights and Anacostia. Route V4 also operated under the Washington Railway & Electric Company under the Capitol Heights-Navy Yard Line between Capitol Heights and Navy Yard. Both lines would later be acquired by Capital Traction Company and were converted into buses on May 1, 1949. Both lines were later acquired by WMATA on February 4, 1973. V2 had a prior incarnation as the 4th Street Line under the Washington Railway & Electric Company but was later replaced by the M2. V4 also had a prior incarnation as the S. Washington-Ridge Rd. under the Capital Traction Company but was later consolidated. V6 was discontinued and replaced by the V4 on January 22, 1984. Route V4 originally operated until the 1990s when they were replaced by the Minnesota Ave-M St Line on December 28, 1991. ===Route U2=== Route U2 originally operated as the Benning-Kenilworth Line under the Washington Railway & Electric Company before being renamed into the V8. Route U2 originally operated into Maryland but was discontinued on December 3, 1978 and replaced by routes F14 and P12. Route U2 would operate as the Deanwood‚ÄìMinnesota Avenue Line between the Deanwood station & Benning Heights (Hanna Place SE & Benning Road SE), via the Minnesota Avenue Metro Station, and then via Minnesota Avenue NE, Eastern Avenue NE, Kenilworth Avenue NE, Deane Avenue NE, Minnesota Avenue NE/SE, Ridge Road SE, Anacostia Road SE, B Street SE, Texas Avenue SE, E Street SE, Alabama Avenue SE, H Street SE, Benning Road SE, Hanna Place SE, and H Street SE. ===1991 Service Changes=== On December 28, 1991, when Anacostia station opened, U2 was rerouted to operate between the Minnesota Avenue station and Anacostia station via Minnesota Avenue NE/SE, Good Hope Road SE, 16th Street SE (to the Minnesota Avenue), W Street SE (Minnesota Avenue), Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE, and Howard Road SE, instead of operating between Deanwood station & Benning Heights. Route U2's routing between the Deanwood and Minnesota Avenue stations, was replaced by the brand new Minnesota Avenue‚ÄìM Street Line, or V7, V8, and V9. U2's routing between the intersection of Anacostia Road SE & Minnesota Avenue SE and Hanna Place SE & Benning Road SE, via Minnesota Avenue SE, Ridge Road SE, Anacostia Road SE, B Street SE, Texas Avenue SE, E Street SE, Alabama Avenue SE, H Street SE, Benning Road SE, Hanna Place SE, and H Street SE to its Benning Heights terminus at the intersection of Hanna Place SE & Benning Road SE, was replaced by route V9. ===2011 Service Changes=== On December 18, 2011, new Saturday service was added to the U2 running every 30 minutes between 6:45 AM to 9:45 PM. ===2014 Study=== During WMATA's Fiscal Year of 2015, they announced a series of proposals of simplification affecting the current routes U2, U4, U5, U6, U8, V7, V8, and V9. At the time of the proposals, the routes were suffering from on-time performances, and several bus bunching on the routes. Route U2 will have daily service at all times between Capitol Heights station and Anacostia station via the current U8 route between Capitol Heights station and Minnesota Avenue station via Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue, then via the current U2 route to Anacostia station. * Route U2 will have daily service at all times between Capitol Heights station and Anacostia station via the current U8 route between Capitol Heights station and Minnesota Avenue station via Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue, then via the current U2 route to Anacostia station. * Routes V7, V8: Daily service at all times between Capitol Heights station and Navy Yard‚ÄìBallpark station via the current U8 route between Capitol Heights station and Minnesota Avenue station, then via the current V7 route to Navy Yard Ballpark station. * Route V9: Peak period service between Benning Heights and Bureau of Engraving via the current V9 route between Benning Heights and Navy Yard Ballpark station, then via the current V7 route to Bureau of Engraving. * Service between Minnesota Avenue station and Deanwood station will be replaced by an extended route U4. * U8 service between Minnesota Avenue and Capitol Heights will be replaced by route U2. The reason for the changes was in order to enhance connectivity between points of regional demand, create a better balance of capacity and demand lines serving the Minnesota Avenue, and to reduce/eliminate service with low productivity on the line. According to WMATA, there will be approximately 700 of 5,300 weekday passenger trips (13%), 750 of 3,200 Saturday passenger trips (23%) and 600 of 2,900 Sunday passenger trips (21%) that will be affected by shortening routes V7 and V8 at Navy Yard Station if the changes occur. Weekday passengers affected may be less due to the proposed extension of route V9. ===2015 Service Changes=== On June 21, 2015, route U2 and renamed route V2 and was extended to Capitol Heights station via Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue and follow U2's routing between Minnesota Avenue station and Anacostia station. Routes V7 and V8 were renamed route V4 which was shorten to Navy Yard‚ÄìBallpark station with service between Navy Yard and the Bureau of Engraving being replaced by route V9 which was renamed route V1. The new line will be called the Capitol Heights‚ÄìMinnesota Avenue Line. Route V2 will operate Monday through Saturday with no Sunday service (the same pattern as the U2), and route V4 will operate daily (the same pattern as routes V7 and V8). In the process of the changes, route U2, V7, V8, ans V9 designation were discontinued, and route U8 was shorten to operate between Minnesota Avenue station and Benning Heights. ==Incidents== * On September 18, 2016, a V4 bus collided with a van along Minnesota Avenue and Hayes Street injuring 20 people. ==References== Category:2015 establishments in Washington, D.C.

Beginning as a tropical depression on May 10 east of Mindanao, Vongfong was the first storm of the 2020 Pacific typhoon season. It gradually organized as it took a slow northward course, strengthening into a tropical storm on May 12 and curving west thereafter. The next day, Vongfong entered a period of rapid intensification, becoming a typhoon and attaining 10-minute maximum sustained winds of 150 km/h (100 mph). The storm made landfall at this intensity near San Policarpo, Eastern Samar, at 04:15 UTC on May 14\\\\. The system tracked across Visayas and Luzon, making a total of seven landfalls. Persistent land interaction weakened Vongfong, leading to its degeneration into a tropical depression over the Luzon Strait on May 17\\\\. Preparations for the typhoon were complicated due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Shelters that opened had to be modified in order to accommodate health guidelines and social distancing. Throughout the Philippines, Vongfong caused around ‚Ç±1.57 billion (US$31.1 million) in damage, and killed five people. == Meteorological history == In early May 2020, an area of atmospheric convection began to persist approximately 545 km (340 mi) southeast of Palau, situated within an environment generally conducive for the formation of a tropical cyclone. However, upper-level wind shear initially prevented much development. Satellite data suggested the presence of broad cyclonic rotation within the disturbance, which was designated Invest 95W by the JTWC. Computer forecast models predicted that the system would track slowly towards the west- northwest. The circulation associated with the storms persisted over subsequent days, and at 00:00 UTC on May 10, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) determined that a tropical depression had developed east of Mindanao, tracking slowly west. Later that day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) followed suit and upgraded the system to a tropical depression, giving it the name Ambo for Filipino interests; it was the first tropical cyclone within the Philippine Area of Responsibility in 2020 and the first of the 2020 Pacific typhoon season. On the same day, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued by the JTWC on the system, noting early signs of rainband development. Though attenuated by the presence of dry air, warm sea surface temperatures, low wind shear, and upper-level outflow supported further development in the storm's early stages as the storm was steered by subtropical ridge. Weak steering currents caused the tropical depression to move slowly northward on May 12. At 12:00 UTC on May 12, the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm, assigning it the name Vongfong.Severe Tropical Storm Vongfong (Ambo) traversing 200x200pxVongfong's cloud tops were rapidly cooling and consolidating upon its upgrade to a tropical storm, indicative of a strengthening cyclone. The storm also began to develop anticyclonic outflow and curved rainbands. A well-defined eye soon emerged on microwave satellite imagery as the storm's structure became further organized, surrounded by hot towers with the storm tracking nearly due west in response to a subtropical ridge centered over the Northern Mariana Islands. At 06:00 UTC on May 13, the JMA upgraded Vongfong to severe tropical storm status, followed by an upgrade to typhoon status six hours later. The eye became increasingly pronounced and contracted to less than 10 km (6 mi) in diameter as the storm's evolution became suggestive of rapid intensification. The JTWC assessed 1-minute sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) at 21:00 UTC on May 13 shortly before the onset of an eyewall replacement cycle; nine hours later, the JMA analyzed Vongfong to have attained 10-minute sustained winds of 155 km/h (100 mph) and a barometric pressure of 965 hPa (mbar; 28.50 inHg). Vongfong made landfall with this intensity over San Policarpo, Eastern Samar, at 04:15 UTC on May 14. The storm's structure degraded due to land interaction as it traversed Samar, causing Vongfong's eye to dissipate. Vongfong made six additional landfalls as it traversed the remainder of the Visayas into Luzon: Dalupiri Island; Capul Island; Ticao Island; Burias Island; San Andres, Quezon; and Real, Quezon. The prolonged interaction with land caused Vongfong to weaken, though the storm maintained a compact circulation amid otherwise favorable atmospheric conditions. On May 15, Vongfong weakened below typhoon status and began to track towards the northwest around the periphery of a subtropical ridge. It weakened further to a tropical storm by 18:00 UTC that day. The center moved off Luzon and became dislocated from atmospheric convection over the Luzon Strait the following day. At 09:00 UTC on May 16, the JTWC issued its final warning on the system. Nine hours later, the JMA downgraded Vongfong to tropical depression status. The PAGASA declared Vongfong to have dissipated on May 17 while over the Bashi Channel. == Preparations == Typhoon Vongfong making landfall on San Policarpo, Eastern Samar on May 14, 2020 Heavy rainfall warnings were triggered by the storm's approach for Caraga Region, Bukidnon and Davao del Norte provinces on May 11. The following day, the PAGASA urged residents to begin preparing for the storm, particularly in the Bicol and Eastern Visayas regions and parts of Luzon. Tropical Cyclone Wind Signal 1 was issued parts of Eastern Samar and Northern Samar by the agency on May 13; this was later extended to include parts of the Bicol region. Tropical Cyclone Wind Signal 3 was ultimately issued for parts of Bicol and Eastern Visayas on May 14 as Vongfong neared landfall. Search and rescue teams in Davao City were advised by the municipal government to be placed on alert for possible landslides and flooding. The 18 Risk Reduction and Management Offices of Albay were activated on May 12. Across the province, at least 35,000 people evacuated, with a total of 80,000 evacuations expected from susceptible areas; mass evacuations were carried out in 15 towns and 3 cities. Due to the threat of flooding and possible lahar flows from Mayon, 515 people evacuated from Guinobatan in Albay. Rice and other crops were harvested early in the province to prepare for the impending storm. The concurrent COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines complicated evacuation logistics, reducing space available for evacuees; to comply with social distancing guidelines enforced in some shelters, evacuation shelters were filled to half-capacity, requiring more evacuation centers to house refugees. The capacity of rooms in evacuation shelters was limited to three families. Cubicles intended for COVID-19 quarantines in Bulusan, Sorsogon, were repurposed as evacuation rooms for those seeking shelter from Vongfong. As a result of the use of schools as quarantine facilities for COVID-19, some schools could not be used as evacuation shelters. The governor of Sorsogon proscribed the movement of vehicles in the province en route to Visayas or Mindanao. In Northern Samar, 400,000 people were expected to evacuate to unused COVID-19 isolation facilities; at least 9,700 evacuees were enumerated in Northern Samar by May 14. Emergency shelters in Bicol housed 145,000 evacuees. Local government units were compelled to begin evacuations in Calabarzon. Cargo vessel and fishing operations throughout the Philippines were suspended by the Philippine Coast Guard. A suspension of work was enacted in Camarines Norte and Catanduanes provinces and Naga, Camarines Sur, on May 14. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) readied logistics assets and US$23 million in disaster relief aid, while the Department of Social Welfare and Development moved relief goods to areas expected to be affected by Vongfong. One person was killed in Albay after being electrocuted by a wire prior to Vongfong's landfall. == Impact and aftermath == 200x200px The outer reaches of Vongfong caused heavy rains in some provinces on May 13, causing flooding in Koronadal. Power outages impacted Eastern Samar, downing communications in several towns. Strong winds damaged weaker homes and fishing boats and downed trees, blocking roads connecting Eastern Samar and Samar. Homes and evacuation centers were damaged across five towns. The roof of an evacuation shelter collapsed, and one person was killed while seeking shelter after being struck by glass shards. Jipapad suffered most extensively of the towns in Eastern Samar, with floods there reaching the second stories of homes and washing out roads, isolating the municipality. Nearly all of the town's populace were displaced by Vongfong. Two people were killed in San Policarpo, where Vongfong initially made landfall, and in Oras, Eastern Samar. In Northern Samar, 2,545 houses were destroyed and another 10,747 sustained damage. The only COVID-19 testing apparatus in Albay, housed at the Bicol Diagnostic Laboratory, was rendered inoperable. The storm displaced over 127,900 residents in Eastern Smaar and nearly 15,900 residents in Northern Samar. Ben Evardone, the governor of Eastern Samar, called the storm \\"Yolanda Jr.\\" in reference to the scale of damage wrought in the province. At least ‚Ç±80 million worth of crops in the Bicol region were lost due to Vongfong. Across Calabarzon, Bicol, and Eastern Visayas, aggregate damage to agriculture was valued at ‚Ç±185.83 million; the precautionary harvesting of crops prior to the typhoon's arrival was estimated to have mitigated ‚Ç±9 billion in damage to rice and corn. According to the NDRRMC, the country's agricultural sector incurred ‚Ç±1.04 billion (US$20.5 million) in damage. The agency estimated that up to 20,652 hectares (51,032 acres) of agricultural land was damaged by Vongfong. Nine villages in Bulacan were inundated by 0.6‚Äì0.9 m (2‚Äì3 ft) of floodwater.

It is unclear whether Riddle graduated from NNU, but evidently the school did not have a curriculum in law. Later, Riddle studied law under Judge Samuel A. Billingsley, and was admitted to the Tennessee bar in 1894. == Career == The young lawyer decided his future would be made in the West, and moved to that part of Indian Territory containing the town now known as Chickasha, Oklahoma. He established a private practice of lawyers that was retained on most of the important legal cases that appeared before the territorial courts before the state of Oklahoma was organized. In 1904, Riddle became eligible to present cases before the United States Supreme Court.Thoburn, Joseph B. A Standard History of Oklahoma. Vol. III. The American Historical Society. Chicago and New York. (1916) p.1078 Available on Google Books. Accessed May 13, 2020.

Hayes, whose term was scheduled to expire in January, 1915. He accepted, even though he continued to live in Chickasha while he served. During the eight months following his appointment, he reportedly wrote eighty opinions, a number never exceeded by an Oklahoma justice in such a short time.Geist, Susan. Transcribed from Joseph B. Thoburn and Muriel H. Wright. Oklahoma: A Story of the State and Its People. Vol. IV. (1929) Accessed May 20, 2020. Riddle served as chief counsel in the impeachment trial of Governor Jack C. Walton and chief counsel for Lt. Governor Martin E. Trapp in a suit to determine whether Trapp could succeeded himself after replacing Walton. Riddle's effort was successful. The Riddles moved to Tulsa after he resigned from the Supreme Court in 1919. He spent the rest of his career as the junior partner of Linn & Riddle. == Personal == Riddle married Miss Letitia Cloud, daughter of a rancher who lived in Gainesville, Texas. The wedding occurred in 1896. They had one child, daughter Frances Alee Riddle, who was born in 1900.

Leander was floated out on 8 March 1848.William Loney RN Plan of Leander drawn in 1843 ==Early service== Leander was commissioned under her first commander, Captain Sidney Dacres, on 28 September 1849. Born into a substantial naval dynasty during the Napoleonic Wars, he eventually rose to the rank of admiral and became First Naval Lord. His only significant action as First Naval Lord was to press for the abolition of masts. He went on to be visitor and governor of Greenwich Hospital. He commissioned her at Portsmouth for particular service in a Squadron of Evolution. He commanded the Leander until 3 June 1852.William Loney RN ==Crimean War service== The Leander at the entrance of Balaclava harbour, 1855 Her next captain, George King, commanded her from 3 June 1852 to 22 November 1854.

The shell burst as it left his hands. For this he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC); it is now displayed at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England. On 13 August 1855 William Moorsom became her captain, and she remained Fremantle's flagship. Her final Crimean War captain was Edward Rice, from 5 January 1856 until she paid off at Chatham Dockyard on 23 September 1856.

Hansen, who proposed naming it \\"Icy Peak\\", but their fellow members at the Mountaineering Club of Alaska persuaded them to adopt a more distinctive name that would be in keeping with the music theme of the immediate area. Within three miles of the peak there is a Symphony Lake, Concerto Peak, Flute Peak, Triangle Peak, Organ Mountain, Cantata Peak, and Hurdygurdy Mountain. The mountain's calliope name was officially adopted in 1969 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. ==Climate== Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Calliope Mountain is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. This climate supports two small unnamed glaciers on the north slope, and the Flute and Organ Glaciers to the east. The months May through June offer the most favorable weather for climbing or viewing this mountain. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of Eagle River. ==See also== *List of mountain peaks of Alaska *Geography of Alaska Eagle Peak, Cantata Peak, and Calliope Peak ==References== ==External links== * Weather forecast: Calliope Mountain Category:Mountains of Alaska Category:Mountains of Anchorage, Alaska ","title":"Calliope Mountain"},{"id":"63951460","text":"Modern Studies is a chamber pop band based between Scotland and Lancashire. The group has released three albums and a remix collaboration, all on Fire Records. ==History== The band was founded in 2015 by Emily Scott, who had been writing songs on an antique harmonium in her home in Glasgow. She arranged to give the instrument to a friend, Pete Harvey, who owned a recording studio called Pumpkinfield in Perthshire, and together they began working on Scott's material with drummer Joe Smillie and multi-instrumentalist Rob St. John. Their first album, Swell to Great, was issued by Song, by Toad Records in 2016 and then reissued worldwide by Fire Records in October 2017. The album was named in MOJO Magazine‚Äôs Top 20 albums of the year list, and on the long-list for the Scottish Album of the Year Award. A follow-up, Welcome Strangers, was released in 2018, and this album was remixed in collaboration with Tommy Perman and issued as Emergent Slow Arcs in 2019. In May 2020, Modern Studies released their third album, The Weight of the Sun.

New York: Prometheus Books. p. 200 Developed in the 1790s, it became widely popular in the United States in the 1830s and 1840s, coinciding with the rise of the Latter Day Saint movement. Phrenology was never endorsed as a part of church theology or doctrine, but neither was it considered incompatible. This contrasts with the basic attitude of Orthodox Christian clergy, who generally condemned phrenology as \\"atheism, materialism, and determinism\\".Davis Bitton and Gary L.

Many early Latter Day Saints, including Joseph Smith, had phrenological readings done, and these readings were used by adherents and critics as supporting evidence of their respective viewpoints.Leaders that had phrenological readings done include Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Brigham Young, George A. Smith, John E. Page, Amasa M. Lyman, Charles C. Rich, George Q. Cannon, Daniel H. Wells, Abraham H. Cannon, Matthias F. Cowley, Orson F. Whitney, Rudger Clawson, Wilford Woodruff, George F.

By the beginning of the 20th century, the respectability of phrenology began to decline, the appeal to Latter Day Saints subsequently faded away, and is currently generally frowned upon. ==Phrenology from 1830 through 1845== ===Book of Abraham Egyptian mummies=== Dr. Samuel Morton's interest in phrenology.From the book Crania Aegyptica by Dr. Samuel Morton published in 1844.

G. W. of Salt Lake City said, > \\"The Phrenological Journal has taught me how to govern and instruct my > children, how to know a good person from a bad one, and is a never ending > source of reflection, knowledge, and happiness.

The weather turned warm however and the heads turned green with rot and were disposed of before they could be shipped.John Alton Peterson, \\"Utah's Black Hawk War\\" (Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1998), Pages 56-57. When the Relief Society was reconstituted in the latter half of the 1860s, secular readings were assigned as part of a study program so the sisters could be well-rounded. A popular source for reading assignments in some wards was the Phrenological Journal. On his return from presiding over the British Mission, Apostle Orson Pratt visited the Fowler studio in New York City on 13 May 1867: > The Office was quite in commotion at the presence of a Mormon Apostle, and > as a privilege both the principal phrenologist and the proprietor, Mr. > Wells, had to lay hands on brother Orson's head, one after the other, not > hearing each other, and then brother Pratt to their amusement and friendly > feeling expressed a desire to do the same for them at some future time. Edward Tullidge, a disaffected member of the LDS Church in the late 1870s, joined the New Movement (Godbeite). He had connections with the editors of the widely distributed Phrenological Journal and used it as an outlet for a public relations campaign in the East.Walker, R. (1976).

Lawrence had the \\"head of the practical and enterprising man.\\" Latter Day Saints George M. Ottinger and Charles Roscoe Savage owned a bookstore that sold publications of the Fowler & Wells Company owned by phrenologists Orson Fowler and Samuel Wells. Ottinger and Savage provided photographs and paintings that the phrenologists valued, including a portrait of Brigham Young. They developed a friendly relationship, with Wells visiting \\"his friends\\" Ottinger and Savage, and Wells even publishing a biography of Ottinger complete with a favorable phrenological reading in the American Phrenological Journal in March 1869.American Phrenological Journal May 1869 online at:https://archive.org/details/americanphrenol05unkngoog/page/n122/mode/2up The friendship may have been a contributing factor in the Phrenological Journal taking a moderate position on Latter Day Saints physiology, a rarity in the scientific community in the 19th century when many were beginning to classify Mormons as degraded, and even a different race. A Scottish phrenologist, Dr. McDonald, visited Utah in 1872 and lectured in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, and in Provo to large audiences. Shortly thereafter a number of lectures were given by famed visiting phrenologist Orson Fowler, causing an excitement in Salt Lake City. In his opening lecture, he publicly gave a reading to Bishop Edwin D. Woolley, and editor of the Salt Lake Tribune, Elias L. T. Harrison. The Tribune reported that Fowler \\"disgusted very many of the audience\\" and that \\"any new beginner could have done better.\\" Rival newspapers, the Deseret News and Salt Lake Daily Herald were generally more receptive and positive of Fowler. Fowler visited Utah again in late 1881. Twenty-three year old Latter Day Saint James Moyle (future politician and father of Apostle Henry D. Moyle) borrowed money to receive a reading, purchased a book, and attended three different lectures by Fowler. His reading said that he \\"would make a good teacher, or politician or lawyer.\\" Moyle did end up becoming a lawyer and politician, but it is not known how much if any the impact his reading had on his career decision. Fowler last visited Utah in 1884. At one of his lectures, he gave a public reading of William S. Godbe, a leader of the New Movement, during which the audience shouted out questions of Godbe's character that Fowler answered. Sarah Granger Kimball received a phrenological reading she valued, telling her that if she were \\"seated in a railway carriage with parties on one hand discussing fashions, and politics to be heard on the other, she would turn to the discussion of politics.\\".

Jessee, The Reliability of Joseph Smith's History, Journal of Mormon History, Volume 3, 1976 page 43 online at: Phrenologists in greater society classified and ranked human races from inferior to superior, with Indians and blacks ranked inferior and white races ranked higher, a system that has been thoroughly debunked but widely influential. This thinking seeped into Latter Day Saint thought as well. For example, the highly influential 1907 Deseret News five-volume book series The Seventy's Course in Theology by church seventy and prominent Mormon theologian B. H. Roberts used phrenology to argue against interracial marriage and social mingling with African Americans: \\"That the Negro is markedly inferior to the Caucasian is proved both craniologically and by six thousand years of planet- wide experimentation; and that the commingling of inferior with superior must lower the higher is just as certain as that the half-sum of two and six is only four.\\"Emily Anderson and Jacqueline Mumford \\"Tanner Humanities Center Hosts Conference on Race in the LDS Church\\" The Daily Utah Chronicle, July 3, 2018, online at: ===The Human Culture Company=== Nephi Schofield and John T.

In November 1903 they created the Human Culture Company, with Miller as President and Schofield as Vice-President, with the intent purpose of promoting phrenology. Stockholders of the company included Franklin S. Richards, Jesse Knight and others. In the year 1905 roughly 60,000 copies of The Character Builder were sold, plus several thousands books. The LDS Church purchased copies of the magazine and sent them to a few hundred missionaries. The Salt Lake Stake contributed $108.35 to the Human Culture Company. Lectures were given in many wards. Schofield left the company for an unknown reason around 1914. Miller continued on with the Character Builder, publishing phrenograms of several prominent Latter Day Saints from direct observation, including Orson F. Whitney and Evan Stephens. He also wrote several phrenological articles for LDS Church periodicals in the 1910s and 1920s.John T.

Miller attempted to revive the movement by writing a letter to the Twelve Apostles, encouraging that phrenology be taught in LDS Church schools including Brigham Young University. Miller argued that respected teacher Karl G. Maeser was a phrenologist, a claim that is disputed.This was based on two sections that Maeser wrote in his book School and Fireside in 1898, which Miller took as endorsing phrenology: \\"Phrenologically speaking, I have noticed that pupils enjoying a keen sense for form, make, all other things being equal, more rapid progress in spelling than pupils less favored in this respect.\\" Karl G. Maeser, School and Fireside 1898, page 314. online at:https://archive.org/details/schoolfireside00maesrich/page/314/mode/2up/search/phrenologically The Apostles referred it to the First Presidency, who were cordial, but did not support the revival. From there, phrenology virtually vanished from the culture of the LDS Church. ===Impact on artwork=== Phrenology had an impact on the appraisal of artwork among early 20th century Latter Day Saints.Noel A.

Historians Davis Bitton and Gary Bunker postulate that this might be due to the appeal of a phrenological reading already being filled by a patriarchal blessing. LDS Church president Ezra Taft Benson described a patriarchal blessing as \\"personal scripture ... the inspired and prophetic statement of your life‚Äôs mission together with blessings, cautions, and admonitions as the patriarch may be prompted to give\\" that should be used as a guide in ones life.Ezra Taft Benson, \\"To the 'Youth of the Noble Birthright'\\", Ensign, May 1986, pp. 43‚Äì44 Similarly, a phrenological reading was considered to be a personal scientific view of particular strengths and weaknesses of a person's mental traits, that was used as a decision making guide in a person's life. Bitton and Bunker note, \\"Without question far more Mormons obtained patriarchal blessings, copied them in their journals or otherwise cherished them, than obtained readings from phrenologists.\\" Some Latter Day Saints did use phrenological readings to guide their lives. General Authority George Reynolds greatly valued his phrenology readings as much as he did his patriarchal blessing. Apostle Rudger Clawson stated in a conference talk in 1898 that \\"a Phrenologist had once predicted that he would yet become an apostle.\\"Abraham Owen Woodruff diary, 9 Oct. 1898, LDS archives. The reference to phrenology was deleted from the official publication of Clawson's talk in Conference Report ... October 1898(Salt Lake City: Deseret News Publishing, 1898), 53-54. ==Aversion towards phrenology== Not all Latter Day Saints felt comfortable with phrenology.

Now, on the contrary, we do not find any history proving that the > Negroes, the descendant of Ham, embraced the Gospel, organized a Church, and > had the gift of the Holy Spirit with them, as did the descendants of Joseph. > By this comparison we may conclude that blood, as well as an organization > and position of bumps gives intellect to perceive truth and piety to serve > the Lord.\\"George Sims \\"Millennial Star\\", 26 (1864), 451-54. online at: > https://books.google.com/books?id=0WLUAAAAMAAJ&q;=phrenology#v=onepage&q;=phrenology&f;=false George Q. Cannon added an editorial after the article endorsing it and encouraged using the \\"Spirit of God\\" as a guide, but also noted, \\"We do believe there is some truth in phrenology.\\" When Fowler visited Utah Territory in 1872, Cannon discouraged elders of the church from patronizing him, insinuating that phrenological readings were part of what led Amasa Lyman and others into apostasy.Minutes of the School of the Prophets, 20 January 1872, Church Archives, as quoted in Davis Bitton and Gary L.

There appears to be abundant proof of the superiority of the ancient Americans in color, in skull structure and shape. ... according to both the Book of Mormon and science, it was not the red man who built cities and erected palaces. It was a nobler race, and they remained fair until they amalgamated with the Lamanites and were brought under the same cursing.Henry A.

After surveying skull characteristics throughout the Americas he concluded, \\"Even those who have held that the 'veritable Mound Builders' were a race superior to the North American Indians have been forced to concede that their crania are of the Indian type.\\" Charles A.

Co., 1910 page 165. online at: http://www.olivercowdery.com/smithhome/1900s/1910Shk1.htm#pg048b In May 1902, Nephi Schofield wrote for the LDS Church magazine Juvenile Instructor, a detailed two part phrenological sketch of Joseph Smith from portraits, in which he confirmed \\"scientifically\\" that Smith's mission was divine. Schofield argued that the \\"prominence of the lower portion of the forehead\\" showed that Smith was \\"physically incapable of conceiving a plan of redemption that even approaches the magnitude of ...

This especially became true as influxes of undesirable converts from perceived inferior white ethnic groups and social classes immigrated to Utah.The American Phrenological Journal and Life Illustrated, Volumes 43-44 online at: https://books.google.com/books?id=JpsTAAAAYAAJ&pg;=RA1-PA144&hl;=en#v=onepage&q;&f;=false A physiognomist in 1852 argued that Joseph Smith had a \\"particularly strong\\" resemblance to a type of bear, \\"which bears the strongest resemblance to the hog. ... as ugly in disposition as in looks.\\" This outward appearance of Smith demonstrated characteristics of \\"a sneaking, under-ground miner, descending lower than the hog, delving for sordid gain, pandering to the strongest. Is such a resemblance to bears, that disgrace the name of their species, to be found on the western continent?\\"James W. Redfield, \\"Comparative physiognomy : or, Resemblances between men and animals\\", 1866, New York : W. J. Widdleton page 192-194.

The argument was the shape of Young's eyes were narrow, and thus more prone to polygamous relationships that lacked dedication.Gary L. Bunker and Davis Bitton \\"Polygamous Eyes: A Note on Mormon Physiognomy\\" Dialouge Journal Volume 12, No. 3, page 118. online at:https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp- content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V12N03_118.pdf Additionally, phrenology was used to explain that Mormon males were naturally drawn towards polygamy. In his 1870 expos√© on Mormonism, J. H. Beadle voiced this argument, stating that Joseph Smith's high marks in \\"amativeness\\" on his phrenology chart show that Smith's \\"sexual passion\\" were the real reason for the doctrine of polygamy.Ricketts, Jeremy R.. \\"Imagining the Saints: Representations of Mormonism in American Culture.\\" (2011) page 86. https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/amst_etds/37John Hanson Beadle,\\"Life in Utah\\" Philadelphia, Pa.; Chicago, Ill., [etc.]: National Publishing Company 1870. page 338. online at: The 1871 Phrenological Journal ran five separate articles on Mormon themes, treating Mormons as a physically different population. This was distinct from the treatment given to other religious groups such as Methodists, Presbyterians and Baptists. The journal tended to be more moderate in its portrayals of the Latter Day Saints. After analyzing hundreds of Mormon heads, results did not support the common belief was that polygamy produced degraded children, and even noted that the majority of Mormons did not practice polygamy. However the journal did note that polygamy was only \\"found in primitive societies\\". Skulls of leaders scored high marks in religious and moral regions, but low in high culture. Converts were called \\"dupes\\" and \\"simple minded\\", but overall had \\"the capacity and weight of the Anglo-Saxon head\\" which the journal considered to be superior. ==Gallery of phrenology readings== File:John C Bennett phrenology chart.PNGJohn C.

During his career he won many tournaments in the Asia-Pacific region, including the Philippine, Taiwan and Singapore national opens on the Asia Golf Circuit. == Professional career == Hsu's first notable performances were at his national open, the Taiwan Open. He won the event in 1965. He attempted to defend his championship the following year and was successful early, holding a share of the lead after the first round. However, he ultimately lost the title to countryman Lu Liang-Huan. In the mid-1960s, Hsu also started playing on the Asia Golf Circuit. He shot an opening round 68 (‚àí4) at the 1967 Thailand Open to take a two shot. He ultimately finished in a tie for fourth place, five behind the champion Tomoo Ishii and one shot behind runner-up finishers Kuo Chie-Hsiung and Tony Jacklin. His first win on the Asian circuit came the following year at the 1968 Philippine Open, where he opened 72‚àí69‚àí68 to hold a four shot lead after three rounds. He extended that lead in the final round, birdieing 4 of the first 8 holes on Sunday to build a 10-shot lead. He shot a final round 69 (‚àí3) to finish eight shots ahead of Japan's Shigeru Uchida. The following April, he came close to winning the Taiwan Open again. Having tied competitor Hideyo Sugimoto at the end of regulation play, Hsu made a bogey at the first playoff hole to finish second. These performances would help Hsu qualify for Taiwan's 1969 World Cup team. Taiwan's team was among the favorites to win the cup. Hsu and teammate Hsieh Yung-yo led the way after the first 36 holes with a 277 total, and eventually finished in a tie for fourth. Hsu went several years without winning a tournament or receiving substantial media coverage. He started to have some success again, however, in the mid-1970s. He held the lead after the first round of the 1973 Thailand Open with Walter Godfrey and Japan's Akio Toyoda. The following year he finished the 1974 Indonesia Open tied in regulation with Australian Graham Marsh and Filipino Ben Arda. Arda won the event on the first playoff hole. In 1975, he held the lead with John Sullivan after the first round of the Malaysian Dunlop Masters. In the next round, he broke the record at the Subang National, shooting a 69 (‚àí3) to take the solo lead. He went on to win the event by three. One year later, he played excellently at the 1976 Taiwan Open, taking the second round lead. He went on to win. He took the lead in the Asia Golf Circuit's Order of Merit standing with the win. Later in the year he would play in his first major championship, the 1976 Open Championship. Hsu shot an 81 (+9) in the first round to put himself outside of the cut line. However, he shot a second round 69 to make the cut by two shots. He finished 71‚àí72 over the final two days. He finished in a tie for 21st. His performance over the final three days was better than all players except Johnny Miller, Jack Nicklaus, Raymond Floyd, and Vicente Fern√°ndez. The 1977 year would also be successful. That March he played excellently at the Singapore Open. Staving off challengers Ben Arda, Mya Aye, and Tomoni Suzuki, the veteran Hsu would play \\"steady\\" golf amidst the \\"tense\\" environment and win by one shot. Later in the year, he again played in the British Open with some success. At the 1977 Open Championship he opened with an even-par 70 to place in the top ten. In the second round he again shot 70. He remained in the top-10 and was only three shots back of Roger Maltbie's lead. He then shot a third round 77 to fall out of contention. However, he would make the third round cut easily, by five shots. In the final round he would shoot a very disappointing 81 and finish at 298 (+18), in a tie for 58th. In late 1970s he would again have some success in Asia. In 1978 he played excellently at the Asia Golf Circuit's unofficial opener, the Philippine Masters, shooting two-under in \\"high winds\\" to win by one. The following year, he would seriously compete at the Hong Kong Open. He was in second place after the first round, one behind Australian Graham Marsh. He continued to play well and was tied for the third round lead with Lu Hsi-chuen. However, both he and Lu shot 74 (+4) in the 4th round and were usurped by Greg Norman. Hsu finished joint runner-up with Lu and fellow Taiwanese Chen Tze-ming, three back of Norman. In the early 1980s he played well at two events on the Singapore circuit. In 1980 he won the Singapore PGA Championship. The following year he held the midway lead at the 1981 Rolex Masters. He went on to win the event. A month later, he recorded one of his final high finishes on the Asia Golf Circuit, finishing runner-up to Payne Stewart at the Indonesia Open. Very late in his regular career, he had some highlights. He finished joint runner-up at the 1986 PGA of Singapore championship, six behind Mario Siodina. He also took the first round lead at that year's Singapore PGA Championship. In 1988, he turned 50 and was eligible for the senior circuit. He won three senior events in Japan in the late 1980s and finished runner-up in four tournaments in 1993. More recently he has played on the Asian Senior Masters and Taiwan PGA Tour. == Professional wins == === Asia Golf Circuit wins (3) === *1968 Philippine Open *1976 Taiwan Open *1977 Singapore Open === Other wins === *1975 Malaysian Dunlop Masters *1978 Bali Open, Philippine Masters *1980 Singapore PGA Championship *1981 Rolex Masters *1983 ROC PGA Championship *1987 Malaysian Royal Johor Classic *1988 ROC PGA Championship === Senior wins === *1988 Japan Ho-Oh Cup Senior Tournament *1989 Japan Ryobi Cup Senior Open, Japan Ho-Oh Cup Senior Open == Results in major championships == { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\\" - eeeeee;\\" !align=leftTournament !1976 !1977 - align=leftThe Open Championship T21 T58 } Note: The Open Championship was the only major Hsu played. \\"T\\" indicates a tie for a place Sources: == Team appearances == *World Cup (representing Taiwan): 1969 == References == Category:Taiwanese male golfers Category:1938 births Category:Living people ","title":"Hsu Chi-san"},{"id":"63951550","text":"Greg Clingham (born 9 March 1953) is a British literary scholar and publisher.

It was commissioned by Infante Peter of Portugal. In his will dictated in 1783, Infante Peter instructed Infante John, his successor over the dominion of the House of the Infantado, the appanage tied to the King's second eldest son, on \\"the great care he ought to take in the divine worship given to God in the Chapel of Bemposta Palace\\"; to this effect, he left \\"the precious Monstrance in [his] possession\\" to that estate's chapel. It is known that in 1832, during the Liberal Wars, the Monstrance (along with other treasures of the Crown and the House of the Infantado; notably the Patriarchal Monstrance) was taken to Queluz Palace and seized by King Michael I. It would only return to Lisbon in 1834, following the Convention of Evoramonte and the end of the civil war. In 1836, in line with the disentailment policies of the new constitutional regime, the Bemposta Monstrance found its way to the National Mint where it was evaluated by Court Assayer Justino Roberto de Sousa and was saved from melting by a report by the Treasury: \\"the ornateness of those pieces far exceeds their intrinsic value, we are of the opinion that it would be the height of barbarity to destroy them ‚Äî a view that did not seem to please the workers of the National Mint.\\" It was then, from 1847, kept by Infanta Isabel Maria in her palace in Benfica. From there, it was incorporated into the collections of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts and thence, in 1884, to the new National Museum of Fine Arts and Archaeology (reorganised into the modern-day National Museum of Ancient Art in 1911). The Monstrance had long been misattributed to Jo√£o Frederico Ludovice and, by consequence, wrongly dated to the 1740s‚Äì50s at the latest. A modern restoration of the Monstrance, undertaken in 2013 for the exhibition \\"A Encomenda Prodigiosa: Da Patriarcal √† Capela Real de S√£o Jo√£o Baptista\\" (\\"The Prodigious Commission: from the Patriarchal Basilica to the Royal Chapel of St. John the Baptist\\"), revealed a hidden inscription saying \\"El Rey D. Pedro 3¬∫ mandou fzr / En 13 Mayo de 1777\\" (\\"King Peter III commissioned it / 13 May 1777\\") and the signature \\"Adam Pollet\\". The date has great significance in that 13 May 1777 was the day of the solemn Acclamation of Queen Maria I, Infante Peter's wife, making him King jure uxoris ‚Äî and suggesting the commission was a votive offering as thanksgiving for having prevailed over the Marquis of Pombal's schemes to hand the crown instead to Joseph, Prince of Brazil. ==Description== Detail of the Monstrance's supporting base, showing the figures of Faith, Hope and Charity A monstrance functions as a vessel to present the consecrated host to the congregation as pert of the Roman Catholic liturgical ritual of Eucharistic adoration. A typical monstrance in form, the highly ornate Bemposta Monstrance comprises a sunburst framing the circular frame for the wafer (which has a curved holder set with stones that holds it up to view, its shape echoing the crescent moon that is usually depicted at the foot of Virgin Mary when evoking the Immaculate Conception) supported on an undulating stem that stands upon an intricately sculpted supporting base. The base is set with figures symbolising the three theological virtues (Faith, Hope and Charity) below angels with the symbols of the Eucharist, flanking narrative medallions showing scenes from the Passion cycle. It is made of gilt silver, and set with numerous stones: diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, amethysts, chrysoberyls, topaz (colourless, Imperial, and pink). ==References== Category:Monstrances Category:Baroque Category:Baroque sculpture Category:Gold objects Category:Gold sculptures ","title":"Bemposta Monstrance"},{"id":"63951578","text":"Chomo Yummo () is a mountain in the Himalayas on the border between Sikkim in India and Tibet in China.

A Democrat, he served as the Auditor of North Carolina from 1947 to 1981. == Early life == Henry Bridges was born on June 10, 1907, to John Joseph Bridges and Ida Carroll in Franklin County, North Carolina, United States. He was the youngest of 12 children. After his parents died, Bridges worked on a cousin's farm in Wake County. He attended Wakelon School from 1914 to 1920, Wiley School in 1921, Wakelon School in 1922, and then Millbrook High School from 1923 to 1925. He then went to Mars Hill College and Wake Forest College, graduating in 1931 with a Bachelor of Arts. He then attended Wake Forest Law School, earning a law degree. He was admitted to the North Carolina State Bar and opened a law practice in Greensboro. He became a member of the Greensboro Bar Association. Bridges enlisted in the North Carolina National Guard in May 1934 as a private. He was promoted to the rank of sergeant in February 1935 before being commissioned a second lieutenant on June 18. He was promoted to first lieutenant on November 18, 1939. He was federalized on September 16, 1940 and released from federal duty on November 2, 1941. Bridges was recalled to federal duty on October 7, 1942 and promoted to the rank of captain on January 28, 1943. During World War II he was stationed with coastal artillery units on Trinidad and at Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands. He was released again from duty on December 14, 1945 and was made a major on January 17, 1947. Following his discharge he returned to legal work in Greensboro. On December 12, 1936 Bridges married Clarice Ramsey Hines. They had two children. == Political career == Bridges was a member of the Democratic Party. From 1933 to 1940 he served as a secretary and treasurer of the Guilford County Democratic Executive Committee. He worked as a deputy clerk at the Superior Court of Guilford County at various times from August 1935 until June 1, 1946, with his active duty military service occurring in the intervening periods. On February 15, 1947 Governor R. Gregg Cherry appointed Bridges Auditor of North Carolina. In 1948 he won election to a full four-year term at the post, and was ultimately reelected seven more times. While in office he had all government departments adopt a uniform accounting system. His insistence on a coherent system of record-keeping led to conflict between him and the State Highway Commission in the early 1970s. In 1974 the North Carolina General Assembly, at his request, authorized the creation of an operational audit program.

The GAP was trained and equipped by Cuba and initially composed of ex guerrilla fighters. ==History== The GAP was initially formed to protect Salvador Allende during the 1970 Chilean presidential election. The GAP was equipped with Cuban-donated RPG-7 anti-tank weapons. ===Formation=== The GAP was formed during Salvador Allende's 1970 presidential campaign by Fernando G√≥mez, a member of the Cuban-trained Bolivian guerrilla group the ELN, at the instigation of Allende's daughter, Beatriz Allende. By the time of the election, the GAP had expanded with the addition of more ex-ELN combatants volunteering to provide security to Allende and, later, members of the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR). Cuba provided technical advisers to assist the GAP, including among them Tony de la Guardia and Patricio de la Guardia. ===Presidential protection=== By the time the main attack got underway, GAP personnel were among the only remaining defenders of La Moneda. On one of Allende's first public appearances after his inauguration, a Chilean journalist inquired of the president who the armed men were accompanying him, to which Allende replied \\"a group of personal friends\\", giving the group the moniker from which it would thereafter be known. During the 1971 visit of Fidel Castro to Chile, Cuban protection officers brought with them an unusually large arsenal including RPG-7s and AK-47s, leaving almost the entire quantity behind in Chile for the previously pistol-equipped GAP. Allende came to rely on the GAP as his principal protective force, despite the organization having no formal legal status. GAP leveraged its hybrid status to conduct recce and intelligence-gathering in Chile under the pretense of presidential protection but with information actually being collected for the benefit of MIR paramilitary operations against the political opposition. However, a 1972 operation in Curimon, in which intoxicated GAP personnel fumbled their mission to locate the whereabouts of Arturo Marshall, made Chilean military intelligence aware of the use of GAP in this manner. This led to the disentanglement of the GAP from MIR, which was put under the formal control of the ruling Socialist Party, leading to the resignation or dismissal of many of the MIR members of the GAP. ===Defense of La Moneda=== At the outset of the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat, the presidential palace of La Moneda was defended by members of the GAP, 20 detectives of the Investigations Police of Chile (PDI), and 300 carabineros. As news of the military uprising reached Santiago, leader Bruno the White led a dozen armed GAP reinforcements to the presidential residence. However, on approaching the PDI detectives stationed at the palace to rally their assistance, the group was promptly disarmed and arrested. At 9:00 a.m. on September 11, the carabineros withdrew after Gen. C√©sar Mendoza, commandant of the Carabineros de Chile, threw the force's support to the military junta. The main attack against the presidential palace commenced shortly after the carabineros had withdrawn. At about 1:30 p.m. on September 11, Chilean Army infantry entered the building; following an exchange of gunfire, GAP personnel surrendered and Allende committed suicide. Nearly 30 GAP personnel either died during the fighting, or were executed after the fall of the palace. ==Organization== The GAP was organized into three elements: Escort, Advance, and Garrison. The Escort group provided close protection to Allende and was composed of approximately 20 men. The Escort group operated blue Fiat sedans; presidential motorcades would generally consist of three Escort group Fiats - one of which, bearing the license plate number \\"1\\", carried Allende - accompanied by police vehicles. The Advance group, led by Francisco Argando√±a (nom de guerre \\"Mariano\\"), had the fewest personnel and was responsible for scouting locations to be visited by Allende prior to his arrival. The Garrison group was divided into three six-man sections, one assigned to each of the three presidential residences and responsible for static security at those locations in concert with police guards. ===Relationship with the police and military=== The relationship between the GAP and the police and military was generally strained. During the failed Tanquetazo coup attempt of June 1973, as reinforced GAP elements hurried Allende to La Moneda, they encountered a patrol of Chilean Army soldiers en route. Though the troops were loyalists, GAP personnel held them at gunpoint until the president's motorcade had passed as a precaution. However, Unidad Popular supporters within the security forces had a more cooperative relationship with the GAP. Gen. Carlos Prats requested the GAP provide for his security, in addition to that of Allende, due to deepening distrust Prats had in his own subordinates. And, during the Tanquetazo, after Allende instructed his GAP protectors not to accompany him into PDI headquarters, Allende's naval attache - Capt. Arturo Arata - countermanded Allende's orders and took personal command of the GAP Escort group, telling them to \\"get their guns out and protect\\" Allende. == Recruitment and training == GAP personnel were recruited from among current Socialist Party of Chile members who were recommended by party functionaries and met physical requirements. Selected members underwent a 15-day weapons and security training course in Cuba. GAP's capabilities were dismissed by Chilean Navy commander Jos√© Toribio Merino who wrote in his memoirs of a visit he made to Allende six days before the coup and recalled that \\"we found ourselves facing a fort, Disney movie style, an armed protected fortress ... a laughable show. What they were doing they took seriously ... They seemed like kids playing bandits\\". ==References== ==External links== * Colorized photograph of Allende with GAP personnel during the defense of La Moneda Category:1970 establishments in Chile Category:1973 disestablishments in Chile Category:Presidency of Salvador Allende ","title":"Group of Personal Friends"},{"id":"63952269","text":"L.E.

Jacob John Halley (1834 ‚Äì 19 January 1910) was a congressional minister and amateur naturalist. He was the first minister to be appointed to the district of the Lower Darling and Murrumbidgee and completed over 50 years in the public ministry in various locations around Victoria. He was a long-time secretary of the Congregational Union of Victoria and served as Chairman from 1907‚Äì09. He is also a former President of the Victorian Field Naturalists Club and former Vice-President of the Microscopical Society of Victoria. He is the father of noted Australian physician and feminist Gertrude Halley. ==Early life== Jacob John Halley was born in London, the son of Robert Halley, an English Congregationalist minister and abolitionist, and his wife Rebecca, n√©e Sloman. Halley was born at Highbury College during the time of his father‚Äôs residence there as classical tutor. After spending his early years in London, his father accepted a commission to Mosley Street Chapel, Manchester. In Manchester, his family became acquainted with the family of Rev. Richard Fletcher, whose daughter Margaret would later become his wife. The Fletcher family relocated to Australia at the request of the Colonial Missionary Society, and a few months later Halley became ill and managed to persuade a doctor to prescribe his own relocation to the warmer climate of Australia. Arriving in Australia around 1855, he first joined the Fletcher family in St. Kilda before moving to Sydney to work as a businessman. He became a member of Pitt Street Uniting Church and a lay preacher in Sydney. He was one of the earliest members of the YMCA in Sydney. He lived in Yass, New South Wales for a time, and was connected with the Methodist Church there, before returning to Sydney in 1857 to attend the University of Sydney and to study with various ministers in order to become a Reverend. Halley did not graduate from university, but in 1859 he was invited to join the minister at Newtown Congregational Church to assist with preaching and mission services. ==Church career== In March 1860, Halley was ordained and appointed as the first minister assigned to the Lower Darling and Murrumbidgee region. His time there was cut short due to illness, and he returned to St. Kilda in 1861, preaching in several churches in that area until receiving an invitation from the Maryborough Church. In 1862, Halley married Margaret Fletcher, and the couple remained in Maryborough until 1864, after which they settled in Ballarat with Halley taking over the ministry of the old Congregational Church near the corner of Dawson and Mair streets. In 1872, they moved back to Melbourne and Halley took over a ministry in Williamstown. At this time, Halley also became Secretary of the Congregational Union of Victoria, a position he would hold until 1908 before serving two terms as Chairman from 1907‚Äì1909. ==Scientific career== Chromolithograph from A Monograph of the Psittacidae by J.J. Halley It is said that Halley had a great knowledge of the flora and fauna of Australia. He got his love of ornithology from his wife‚Äôs brother, Price, who worked on the station where his mission was located while he was assigned to the Lower Darling and Murrumbidgee region, where the two men would go on bird hunting expeditions with Indigenous locals. In 1871, Halley self-published the beautifully illustrated A Monograph of the Psittacidae or Parrot Family of Australia. The monograph was intended to be a multi-part study, however only one part, including three plates, were published due to financial constraints owing to a lack of subscribers. Only a small number of copies were printed, and of these only four are extant, making it a rare publication. The three chromolithographed plates are made after original watercolours by James Whitley Sayer, and one is attributed to have been put ‚Äòon stone‚Äô by Richard Laishley, who was a minister in the Congregational Church and a gifted artist. Laishley exhibited and sold his lithographic illustrations, with accompanying descriptions by Halley, intended for a projected book on the parrots of Australia in the Victorian section at the 1870 Sydney Intercolonial Exhibition. The prints were highly commended by the fine art jurors. Halley was also in correspondence with Silvester Diggles around the time of the publication of Monograph of the Psittacidae. He was Vice-President of the Microscopical Society of Victoria around 1880, and President of the Victorian Field Naturalist's Club from 1884 to 1887. In his Presidential address of 1885 Halley advocated for an increase of women in science, and for women to be equal to men in scientific endeavours. Ferdinand von Mueller named the plant Hypsophila halleyana after Halley, the first description of which was published in The Victorian Naturalist, the journal of the Victorian Field Naturalist's Club, towards the end of Halley‚Äôs run as President of the Club. ==Death== J.J. Halley died suddenly on a Melbourne tram on 19 January 1910. At the intersection of Flinders Street and William Street he was seen to slump forward. Two policemen carried him to a chemist on Flinders Street and from there he was taken by ambulance to the Melbourne Hospital, but he was dead on arrival.

It was developed in 1969 and tested since 1972. The letters has been simplified and the shapes approximated the block letters. As of 2017, the Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift is mandatory in Saxony-Anhalt. In another 10 of the 16 German federal states, it is available for schools to choose from, among other cursives. == Overview == The difficulties in learning the Latin script developed from the \\"Deutschen Normalschrift\\" prompted the development of a standardised cursive. The Vereinfachten Ausgangsschrift was intended to correct inconsistencies in the Latin source script and to develop a script that was easier to learn. The Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift is primarily based on the Lateinische Ausgangsschrift and is also based on the Druckschrift (DS). During development, attention should be paid to a consistent and logical flow of writing, the analogy to the printed text, a light motor implementation and the avoidance of unnecessary decorative elements. == Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift compared to the Lateinische Ausgangsschrift == In the Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift, almost all lowercase letters begin and end on the upper middle band. 116x116px This is very important for the flow of writing, since so-called \\"breakpoints\\" are always \\"starting points\\" for the letters. In the original Latin script, connecting the letters is considered to be easier in terms of typing, but more difficult to learn because there are four different options. With the simplified initial script, almost all lowercase letters begin and end at the same place. The letters are therefore standardized in the simplified initial script. In the Latin source script, there are several letter combinations for the same letter. (Example: Latin source script above, simplified source script below). The simplified source font disrupts the flow of writing through ‚Äújerky‚Äù transitions, but enables textbook publishers to use a standardized printing set instead of costly handwritten sample texts.http://www.taz.de/1/zukunft/bildung/artikel/1/keine-paedagogischen- interessen/ Example of a couple Latin phrases The striking feature of the simplified initial font is the ‚Äúspread‚Äù (or ‚Äúsheet‚Äù, e.g. ‚Äúb‚Äù), which, when put together, only occurs with the last letter of the word. However, this ‚Äúspread‚Äù is an integral part of each letter, as it is intended to enable a fluid, uniform connection of the letters. As the letter is the small \\"z\\" with sub-loop emphasize that in this form has a centuries-old tradition in the writing, Kurrent- and Fraktur has. The capital letters of the Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift differ from the Lateinische Ausgangsschrift. The publication was taken into account because the students learn it first. frameless == References == == External links == * Universit√§t Essen: Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift ‚Äì Pro & Contra (PDF; in German) * Kostenloser Downloader der Open-Source-Schriftart (OTF-Font; in German) * Das Original: Kostenloser Download Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift, unliniert (TT-Font; in German) * Die Zeit, 24 March 2011: Schreibschrift: Mit Schwung, aber lesbar!

Built in 1896, the hotel burned to the ground in 1910. The blaze left two people dead and the territorial governor of Arizona homeless. The hotel was rebuilt on the same location in 1911 and imploded in 1973 to make way for a third hotel, currently the Renaissance. ==History== The Adams Hotel was founded by J. C. Adams, a newcomer to Phoenix in 1896 who served two terms as the city's mayor. The building's foundation had been laid by June 1896. Construction finished later that year and the hotel opened to guests in late November 1896, with a formal opening in December. The hotel also hosted the offices of the Maricopa Club, a local membership organisation, and the local chamber of commerce. The Adams featured four stories, an elevator, a dining room, and 90 guest rooms, of which \\"two-thirds\\" had private toilets. At the time of the fire, the hotel also counted a barber and a shoe shine among its tenants. ===Fire=== Around 5:45 am on the morning of May 17, 1910, a fire broke out in the basement of Hotel Adams. The basement was used for storage for the hotel's pharmacy. Arizona Territorial Governor Richard Elihu Sloan and his family were residing in the hotel at the time and were left homeless by the fire; the governor's daughter was saved by the night bell clerk Henry Willey, who was also the first person to spot the smoke coming from the basement. Willey and a porter were able to warn all of the guests of the hotel and a proper evacuation ensued. No deaths were initially reported, but two people died in the blaze. Damage was estimated at $250,000. ==Hotel Adams (1910‚Äì1973)== The hotel was quickly rebuilt after the fire. Only three days after the fire had consumed the first hotel, Adams had pitched in $75,000 for the rebuilding and, with clear demand for a modern hotel in the Phoenix area, an additional $43,000 was raised in only four minutes. Work on the new hotel began in January 1911 and was scheduled to be completed by September. After a brief work stoppage relating to the potential for prohibition in Phoenix, the building opened in stages with guests arriving on November 6, 1911, just in time for the territorial fair. On its first day, the hotel's usual 178 rooms were expanded to 186, all of which were occupied. The wireless transmitter on the roof had opened a couple of weeks earlier, in October 1911, and wirelessly linked Arizona with California for the first time. A nine-story addition was added in 1928, adding 112 rooms. Air conditioning was added in 1929 and the system was expanded in the 1930s, one of the first hotels in the world with the feature. Frances Bergen's first appearance came at the hotel's Corinthian Room. The hotel was sold in February 1972 for $2.3 million to Dallas company Continental Firms. Continental would sell to Vita Trading Co. in 1973. The hotel closed in May 1973. While the hotel had been built to survive another fire, the new fire code would have required the building to retrofit a sprinkler system which was deemed to be cost-prohibitive. Drawings for a new $20 million, 18-story Rodeway-branded hotel on the site were drawn up. The front five stories of the hotel was partially imploded on August 12, 1973, with the remaining twelve story rear part of the building coming down in late September. The second Adams was the first building in Arizona to be imploded. ==Current hotel (1975‚Äì)== The new hotel opened in April 1975 and was initially known as the Adams Hotel. With 538 rooms, it was the largest hotel in Arizona at the time of opening. The new hotel initially struggled and Vita Corporation, the owners, filed for bankruptcy in 1976. In 1981, the hotel was first bought out of bankruptcy by a Prudential Insurance company subsidiary and subsequently became a member of the Hilton brand. The hotel was renamed the Adams Hilton. The hotel, known in the 1980s as the New Adams Hilton and the Phoenix Hilton, became the Phoenix Sheraton hotel sometime during early 1988. In 1991 it became the Omni Adams, and then became the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza in 1993. ==References== Category:Demolished hotels in the United States Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1896 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1973 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Arizona Category:Burned hotels in the United States Category:Hotels in Arizona Category:1896 establishments in Arizona Territory Category:Former buildings and structures in Phoenix, Arizona ","title":"Hotel Adams"},{"id":"63953427","text":"The 1999 Women's Oceania Cup was the inaugural edition of the women's field hockey tournament.

Located entirely within Medford, Massachusetts, the branch connected Medford Square to the B&M; main line. It had passenger service from 1847 to 1957, with freight service on the inner part of the line until 2010. ==History== The Boston and Lowell Railroad was built in 1835 through West Medford, followed by the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;) through the east part of Medford in 1844. On March 7, 1845, the state legislature approved the charter of the Medford Branch Rail-road Company to build a branch line from the B&M; mainline to Medford Square. The railroad had been formed by a group of citizens including James O. Curtis earlier that year. The group almost immediately acted on the charter provision which allowed them to transfer the line to the B&M;, which constructed the line and opened it as the Medford branch on March 2, 1847. It ran about from Medford Junction (north of Wellington station) to Medford Square. By 1875, an intermediate station - East Medford - had been added at Spring Street. A second stop at Park Street was added by 1889. The East Medford station had been renamed Glenwood by then, and was relocated slightly to the east by 1900. The remaining spur to the Medford branch, seen in 2017 In the 1890s, the B&M; double-tracked the branch to provide more frequent service to compete with electric streetcars. The branch was then a busy commuter route; at the peak levels of B&M; service in 1906, the branch had 21 daily round trips. However, ridership was soon decimated by the streetcars operated by the Boston Elevated Railway and the Bay State Street Railway. The B&M; attempted to end service in 1917; after negotiations with the town, the railroad kept four daily round trips. This increased slightly to six daily round trips by 1919. Operation of a gasoline-electric railcar on the branch was considered in 1925. Service on the branch was discontinued for some period in 1933‚Äì34; the station buildings remained closed after service resumed. As a marginal route, the branch was often closed entirely during service disruptions like those caused by the April 1946 and March 1948 coal mine strikes. By 1949, only a single daily round trip remained. This trip was discontinued on October 1, 1957. The section of the line between Park Street and Medford Square was abandoned in 1959, with the Northern Expressway soon built across it. The section between Park Street and Glenwood was abandoned two years later, while freight service continued on the remaining section. In the early 1970s, an underpass for the Orange Line and Reading Line was built at Medford Junction as part of the Haymarket North Extension. (Never-realized plans in the 1940s had called for the Medford branch to be reused as an Orange Line branch. (second section, third page) ) Regular freight service ended in 2008, though a single trip to deliver a single carload of fish was run in 2010. The only remaining station structure is the Park Street station, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. ==References== ==External links== Category:Boston and Maine Railroad Category:Medford, Massachusetts Category:Defunct Massachusetts railroads ","title":"Medford branch (Boston and Maine Railroad)"},{"id":"63953521","text":"Surovsky () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Ostrovksoye Rural Settlement, Anninsky District, Voronezh Oblast, Russia.

F. Degen (born c. 1955) is an American biochemist, molecular geneticist and Professor Emerita at the University of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in the Department of Pediatrics. Degen was a professor at the University of Cincinnati for over thirty years, where she led a research program focused on probing the biology underlying blood coagulation, growth factors, and growth control. Her lab discovered a novel growth factor called hepatocyte growth factor-like protein. Degen is a member of several national societies and is an elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). == Early life and education == Degen was born in 1955 in Glendale, California. She grew up just outside of Los Angeles, in the San Fernando Valley of California. Her father was a scientist and her mother was a seamstress and she was one of four children. It was only once Degen started her undergraduate degree that she realized she wanted to pursue a career in science. First deciding to focus her studies in mathematics, Degen pursued her Bachelor of Arts at the University of California, San Diego. She switched her major to Chemistry after experiencing a challenging chemistry class and was excited to learn more. In her final year at UCSD, she worked in the laboratory of Russell F. Doolittle studying fibrinogen, a blood clotting factor. She became an author on several papers through her undergraduate work, specifically characterizing the amino acid sequences of the alpha chain of fibrinogen. She graduated in 1976 with a degree in Chemistry. Following her undergraduate degree, Degen pursued a Ph.D. in Biochemistry at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington. She worked in Earl Davie's lab studying human prothrombin, another blood protein involved in coagulation. She completed her Ph.D. in 1982 and moved to Switzerland to complete her postdoctoral work at the Friedrich Miescher Institute in Basel, Switzerland. During her two-year postdoc, Degen worked under the mentorship of Edward Reich studying the plasminogen activator gene. Degen completed her postdoctoral training in 1985. == Career and research == In 1985, Degen was recruited to the University of Cincinnati in Cincinnati, Ohio where she became an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the Children's Hospital Medical Center. In 1992 she was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure and finally received her Full Professorship in 1997. In 2004, Degen was appointed the acting vice president for research at the University of Cincinnati. Degen also held appointments as the Associate Chair of Academic Affairs for the Department of Pediatrics, and was the Chair of the Department of Pediatrics Reappointment, Promotion, and Tenure Committee. She held her full professorship until 2015, at which point she became a professor emerita for the University of Cincinnati. While at Cincinnati, Degen was the principal investigator of a lab studying the regulation and biology of the blood coagulation protein, prothrombin. Her lab discovered a novel growth factor called hepatocyte growth factor-like protein and they extensively studied the functions of this growth factor as well as its tyrosine kinase receptor, Ron. During her tenure at Cincinnati, Degen and her lab filed three patents for their growth factory discoveries and their use in treating hepatic disorders. Beyond her research, Degen has actively contributed to bettering the academic environment for women and promoting gender equity in science. She help start the Women Scholars Program and Young Women Scholars Program at the University of Cincinnati Children's Hospital which served to support the career development of women across career stages. Degen also showed her commitment to inspiring the next generation of young scientists by supporting development programs for high schoolers and conducting annual science career days. For her work, she was named Woman of the Year Runner-Up by the Cincinnati Youth Collaborative in 2014. === Characterization of prothrombin cDNA === During her graduate studies, Degen and her colleagues were the first to isolate and characterize complementary DNA (cDNA) coding for both bovine and human prothrombin. Prothrombin is a coagulation factor critical in the initial steps of blood clotting. They prepared the human prothrombin from human liver mRNA. Prior to their characterization, only the amino acid sequences had been reported, so they compared their cDNA sequences to the previously reported amino acid sequences and found several differences in the predicted amino acid structure from their cDNA. Several years later, after isolating cDNA for prothrombin from mice, they were able to characterize the complete prothrombin cDNA and from this predict the complete amino acid sequence of the prothrombin protein in mice. They subsequently mapped the gene to the mouse chromosome 2. === Characterization of human tissue plasminogen activator gene === During her postdoctoral work, Degen led a team to characterize the human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) gene. Human t-PA is a protein implicated in the breakdown of blood clots and is expressed in many tissues as well as by tumors. Degen's characterization of the complete nucleotide sequence was prompted by the desire to study the complex genetic regulation of t-PA expression and the implications this has in tumor growth. Their analysis highlighted several reading frames of the gene which prompted further investigation of the various gene products possible. === Characterization of hepatocyte growth factor-like protein === Early into her career at the University of Cincinnati, Degen led a team towards the discovery of a novel kringle-containing protein in mice which they called hepatocyte growth factor- like (HGFL) protein. They sequenced, for the first time, the gene and complementary DNA and found that it shared the same structural domains as hepatocyte growth factor, hence their name choice. They found that the gene expression was restricted to the liver via in situ hybridization analysis and thus despite the similarities to hepatocyte growth factor, its expression profile in primarily hepatocytes allowed Degen to conclude that it was in fact a novel protein. Following this discovery, Degen and her team characterized the functional domains of the protein to understand its biological importance. Since HGFL had been found to play a role in stimulating mouse resident peritoneal macrophages and inducing cellular proliferation, motility, and apoptosis, Degen and her team sought to probe the function of the specific domains of the protein. They caused site-directed and deletion mutations in cDNA that coded for the protein and found that the heavy chain may play an important role in its function while the light chain may play a role in binding to its receptor, Ron. They later disrupted the HGFL gene in mice rendering loss of the HGFL protein to probe its impact on cellular and system function. They found that, though loss of HGFL delayed macrophage activation, it was not essential for embryogenesis, fertility, nor wound healing. When Degen and her team next probed the importance of the HGFL receptor, Ron, in biological functions, they found that ablation of the tyrosine kinase domain of Ron caused altered ability to regulate nitric oxide as well as enhanced tissue damage following cell-mediated inflammation. Next, they probed the effects of Ron tyrosine kinase domain deletion on mouse reproduction and found that it led to decreases in ovulation of oocyte complexes as well as increased levels of induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) before and after ovulation. They concluded that the increase in iNOS which leads to an increase in nitric oxide is likely the cause of the decreased ovulation rates. == Awards and honors == * 1987-1991 Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences * 1978 Elected membership in the American Chemical Society * 1989 Elected membership in American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology * 1997 University of Cincinnati Faculty Achievement Award * 2001 Leading Women of Cincinnati Award for Technology/Science/Research * 2004 Nominee for Outstanding Woman at Cincinnati Children's Hospital * 2004 - 2005 Howard Hughes Medical Institute/Burroughs Welcome Foundation Partners in Scientific Management Program * 2005 Founders Award, Women's Faculty Association, Cincinnati Children's Hospital * 2005 Recognition Award in Thrombosis, American Heart Association, National Center, Council on Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology * 2011 Elected American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Fellow * 2011 Elected to National Institutes of Health working Group for Future Biomedical Research Workforce * 2012 Elected, Charter Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors * 2012 Mentoring Achievement Award, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center * 2014 WE Celebrate Award Finalist and Runner-up for Women of the Year (Corporate category), Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber == Select publications == * Mullins ES, Kombrinck KW, Talmage KE, Shaw MA, Witte DP, Ullman JM, Degen SJ, Sun W, Flick MJ, Degen JL.

He was the author of the first book on the use of video in sport. Lyons founded the Centre for Notational Analysis at the Cardiff Institute of Higher Education in 1992 with the help of John Pugh, Peter Treadwell, David Cobner and Sean Power. He moved to Australia in 2002 to take up a position as the founding Coordinator of Performance Analysis at the Australian Institute of Sport. He was the founding Director of the Institute of Sport Studies at the University of Canberra in 2009. Lyons blogged about his work in teaching, coaching and performance on the \\"Clyde Street\\" blog from 2008 onwards. ==Personal== Lyons was born in Buckley, Flintshire, Wales on 7 May 1952. His parents were Donald and Joan Lyons. His siblings were footballer John and Judith. His brother committed suicide in 1982. Keith Lyons attended the Alun School, Mold (1963-70), the University of York (1970-73), Loughborough College (1974-75), the London School of Economics and Political Science (1980-82) and the University of Surrey (1983-89). His PhD at the University of Surrey was titled 'A sociological analysis of the teaching of boys' physical education in the secondary school'. He played rugby for Ruthin RFC, University of York, Loughborough College, London Welsh RFC and Rosslyn Park FC. He represented North Wales at rugby union and played against three international touring teams, Tonga national rugby union team, Romania and the Welsh President's XV. After his retirement from rugby union, Lyons coached St Mary's College and Exeter University rugby union teams. He coached women's lacrosse and was an assistant coach to the Welsh team at the 1997 Lacrosse World Cup in Japan. He was the national coach for whitewater slalom (canoe slalom) in Wales 1998‚Äì2002. Lyons was a physical education teacher at Whitton Comprehensive School, Richmond-upon-Thames (1975-78), a lecturer in human movement studies at St. Mary's College. Lyons lived in Braidwood, New South Wales and was a volunteer member of the NSW Rural Fire Service. He was married to Sue and they had two children, Beth and Sam. Lyons died on 13 May 2020 in Canberra Hospital of cerebral lymphoma. ==Analysing performance== ===Early years=== Lyons' experience of sport and physical education led him to think about the systematic observation and analysis of player, teacher and coach behaviour. At Loughborough College, he was introduced to a range of ideas that informed his interest in the observation and analysis of performance. These included Rudolf Laban's effort notation and teaching games for understanding. At this time he met three leaders in the coaching of rugby union Ray Williams, Tony Gray and Jim Greenwood. This combination of experiences in teacher education and coaching framed Lyons' professional practice in notation and performance analysis. He started notating real-time performance in rugby union games in 1978 when he was appointed coach of the St Mary's College rugby union team. He qualified as a Welsh Rugby Union coach that year. By 1980, he was teaching courses in match analysis to students in the Human Movement Studies degree at St Mary's College. These courses used some of the early literature in notational analysis. At that time Lyons formed a close working relationship with the head of the audio-visual department at the College, Mike Murnane, and was able to use some of the early domestic video cameras to record rugby union games for lapsed-time analysis. Lyons and Murnane worked with women's hockey and lacrosse to support coach education courses. In 1982 they recorded all games played at the inaugural Women's Lacrosse World Cup at the Trent Bridge cricket ground, Nottingham. At that time (the early 1980s) there was an emerging interest in the United Kingdom in the analysis of performance in sport and physical education. Celia Brackenridge and John Alderson reported on some of this work. The first workshop to discuss the role of video in sport was organised by Les Burwitz in 1986. Lyons' book provided an overview of the emerging use of video in the analysis of performance. His PhD thesis extended that work to share a qualitative account of teaching physical education that drew upon systematic observation protocols. ===Working with sporting organizations=== Throughout the 1980s, Lyons provided analyses of performance to club and international rugby union teams. In 1991, he was appointed as the notational analyst for the Welsh Rugby Union and attended the Rugby World Cup. A year later, with the help of colleagues in the School of Sport at the Cardiff Institute of Higher Education he established the Centre for Notational Analysis. The Centre was planned as a service to sport with the explicit aim of working with sport organizations to adopt real-time and lapsed-time analyses of performance in training and competition environments. During the 1990s, the clients of the Centre included The Welsh Rugby Union, the Football Association of Wales, the Football Association, Great Britain Hockey, the Welsh Lacrosse Association and the Welsh Canoeing Association. The Centre worked to support the British Lions rugby union tour of South Africa in 1997, provided a video service for the International Federation of Women's Lacrosse Associations at the 1997 World Cup in Japan and serviced the South African football team at the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. Lyons was a member of the Welsh Rugby Union's Senior, A and Under 21 management team from 1995 to 1998 and was one of the first officially recognized performance analysts in world rugby union. The Centre was renamed the Centre for Performance Analysis in 1997. This name change marked an important epistemological shift in the work of the Centre. Thereafter work with sporting organizations focused on performance in applied contexts and staff at the Centre developed expertise in educational technology. Lyons left his role of Director of the Centre in 1998 but continued to work with the Centre up until his departure for Australia in 2002 to take up a position at the inaugural Co-ordinator of the Performance Analysis Unit at the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). In 2006 ,he was appointed Head of Biomechanics and Performance Analysis at the AIS. He was appointed Professor of Sport Studies at the University of Canberra in 2009. He retired from the University in 2013. During his time at the University, he supervised PhD candidates in numerous disciplines, including nursing, sports, biomechanics and sports management. From 2013 to 2017, the Rugby Football Union and England Wales Cricket Board engaged Lyons on a ‚Äòlearning journey‚Äô project with some of their ten of the top professional coaches. During his time in Australia, Lyons made a significant contribution to paddling as a Paddle Australia director (2009-2013) as well as a volunteer, coach, parent and sports scientist in slalom canoeing. === Open Sharing === In 2011, the International Journal of Computer Science in Sport published Lyons' paper Sport Coaches' Use of Cloud Computing: From Here to Ubiquity. In it he explained his interest in open sharing and the use of cloud computing resources so to do. The abstract of his paper: > Cloud computing is providing sport coaches with opportunities to transform > their work with athletes. This paper identifies characteristics of Cloud > computing and discusses sport coaches‚Äô use of the ‚ÄòCloud‚Äô. Examples are > presented of this use in the sport of canoeing in Australia. The paper > examines some of the risks inherent in a move to Cloud computing whilst > acknowledging the dynamic possibilities available from new ways of > communicating. The paper concludes with a discussion of the use of iterative > ‚Äògood enough‚Äô approaches to digital repositories. The curation and aggregation of digital resources has been one of Lyons' primary concerns in his career. He was an early adopter of social media resources, particularly microblogging services, as they emerged in digital computing. ===Anti-apartheid activities=== Whilst at the University of York, Lyons specialized in the study of the politics of Southern Africa. Under the supervision of Christopher Hill and Adrian Leftwich, he used his interest in sport to investigate the impact of South Africa's apartheid policy on sport opportunity. His undergraduate thesis was titled Sanctions against Apartheid Sport. During that time he was introduced to Dennis Brutus and was given access to the archived papers of the Capricorn Africa Society held at York as a primary source for his research. Years later he met Sam Ramsamy and Peter Hain. He became involved in the activities of South Africa non-racial Olympic Committee (SAN-ROC) and spoke out as a rugby union player about the impact of apartheid on sport. As a result of these activities he was placed on a list of sportsmen excluded from traveling to South Africa. He was able to visit South Africa in 1995 as a member of the management team for the Welsh rugby union team participating in the World Cup. ==References== ==External links== *Clyde Street Blog Category:1952 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Sports scientists Category:University of Canberra alumni Category:Alumni of the University of York Category:Alumni of Loughborough University Category:Alumni of the University of Surrey Category:Alumni of Cardiff Metropolitan University Category:Welsh rugby union players Category:Rosslyn Park F.C. players Category:London Welsh RFC players Category:Welsh rugby union coaches ","title":"Keith Lyons"},{"id":"63953698","text":"The Mathematics of Chip-Firing is a textbook in mathematics on chip-firing games and abelian sandpile models. It was written by Caroline Klivans, and published in 2018 by the CRC Press. ==Topics== The identity element of an abelian sandpile model A chip-firing game, in its most basic form, is a process on an undirected graph, with each vertex of the graph containing some number of chips. At each step, a vertex with more chips than incident edges is selected, and one of its chips is sent to each of its neighbors. If a single vertex is designated as a \\"black hole\\", meaning that chips sent to it vanish, then the result of the process is the same no matter what order the other vertices are selected. The stable states of this process are the ones in which no vertex has enough chips to be selected; two stable states can be added by combining their chips and then stabilizing the result. A subset of these states, the so-called critical states, form an abelian group under this addition operation. The abelian sandpile model applies this model to large grid graphs, with the black hole connected to the boundary vertices of the grid; in this formulation, with all eligible vertices selected simultaneously, it can also be interpreted as a cellular automaton. The identity element of the sandpile group often has an unusual fractal structure. The book covers these topics, and is divided into two parts. The first of these parts covers the basic theory outlined above, formulating chip-firing in terms of algebraic graph theory and the Laplacian matrix of the given graph. It describes an equivalence between states of the sandpile group and the spanning trees of the graph, and the group action on spanning trees, as well as similar connections to other combinatorial structures, and applications of these connections in algebraic combinatorics. And it studies chip-firing games on other classes of graphs than grids, including random graphs. The second part of the book has four chapters devoted to more advanced topics in chip-firing. The first of these generalizes chip-firing from Laplacian matrices of graphs to M-matrices, connecting this generalization to root systems and representation theory. The second considers chip-firing on abstract simplicial complexes instead of graphs. The third uses chip-firing to study graph-theoretic analogues of divisor theory and the Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem. And the fourth applies methods from commutative algebra to the study of chip-firing. The book includes many illustrations, and ends each chapter with a set of exercises making it suitable as a textbook for a course on this topic. ==Audience and reception== Although the book may be readable by some undergraduate mathematics students, reviewer David Perkinson suggests that its main audience should be graduate students in mathematics, for whom it could be used as the basis of a graduate course or seminar. He calls it \\"a thorough introduction to an exciting and growing subject\\", with \\"clear and concise exposition\\". Reviewer Paul Dreyer calls it a \\"deep dive\\" into \\"incredibly deep mathematics\\". Another book on the same general topic, published at approximately the same time, is Divisors and Sandpiles: An Introduction to Chip-Firing by Corry and Perkinson (American Mathematical Society, 2018). It is written at a lower level aimed at undergraduate students, covering mainly the material from the first part of The Mathematics of Chip-Firing, and framed more in terms of algebraic geometry than combinatorics. ==References== Category:Graph theory Category:Cellular automata Category:Critical phenomena Category:Mathematics textbooks Category:2018 non-fiction books ","title":"The Mathematics of Chip-Firing"},{"id":"63953737","text":"Cutting is a surname.

The album, released independently on November 12, 2010, was the first studio album of the band since its establishment in Shijiazhuang, Hebei in 1996. After many personnel changes, the members of the band were Dong Yaqian, Shi Li, Ji Geng, and Yang Yougeng by the time Omnipotent Youth Society was released. The album features a variety of genres, ranging from blues-style solos to folk-rock, progressive rock, alternative rock, hard rock, blues-rock, and elements related to free jazz. The lyrics deal with social issues, politics, depression, and the idiosyncrasies of the younger generation. Some brass instruments are used, such as saxophone, trumpet, and cello. The trumpet played by Shi Li takes a large part in the album. Since its release, the album has received positive reviews from some music critics and mainstream media in the mainland of China and Taiwan. The album helped OYS win the Best Band Award on the 11th Chinese Music Media Awards and seven nominations of other awards. The success of the album also popularise OYS in Taiwan and influenced the local music industry. == Recording == Influenced by American rock band Blind Melon, The Nico was formed in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China in 1996. The band was named after the daughter of Shannon Hoon, the lead vocalist of Blind Melon at the time. The initial members were Ji Geng (Bass), Zhang Peidong (Drum), and Dong Yaqian (Guitar and lead vocalist). They considered of writing lyrics in English at first. In 2000, Dong Yaqian suffered a serious depression after his childhood friend and classmate, Ji Geng went to the south of China for further study. After a month of accompanying Ji Geng's study, Dong Yaqian went to Qinhuangdao to recuperate for a while. During this period, Dong was practising the guitar all the time and composed the melody of ‚ÄúQinhuangdao‚Äú. Cui Xudong, the guitarist, was thereafter added to the band in 2000. In 2001, Zhang Peidong, the drummer, left the band to pursue further study in Japan. After the new drummer, Xun Liang joined the band, The Nico officially changed its name into Omnipotent Youth Society under the suggestion of Ji at the end of the same year. Ji wrote the lyrics of The Less Than Omnipotent Comedy in 2003, and it was the first successful try on lyrics by OYS. In 2004, Xun and Cui left the band, and Ji went to Hebei Normal University for postgraduate study in English. By the year 2006, Dong returned to Shijiazhuang, and Ji returned to OYS. They recruited Feng Yuliang (Saxist), Lu Zhi (Cellist), and Shi Li (Trumpeter). Since 2007, OYS started performing some of the songs in OYS (album) in live houses like Mao Live. Before the official recording of OYS started, some demos recorded by band members in 2003-2004 had already been spread widely on the internet. The recording work officially started in 2008. Band members were reluctant to go to studios for the work, so they planned to finish the job at home, which brought lots of problems. In the beginning, OYS had had a U-87 microphone and purchased Fender deluxe reverbs, but the results were not satisfying. They later realized it was essential to use microphone preamplifier and then spent 16,000 RMB to get one. With the new equipment, OYS finally finished the recording of electric guitar part of ‚ÄúTen Thousand Hippies‚Äù and ‚ÄúQinhuangdao‚Äù. Then the band found that their room was too small to guarantee the quality of drum track recording, so they gave up the idea of recording all the songs and turned to rearrange current works. Dong got to know about multitrack recorders later and asked friends to buy two of them on French websites. By the time OYS went to Beijing, they obtained some pre-owned acoustic boards to reform their recording room. They finished the recording of flute, acoustic guitar, and jazz drum tracks there. Then they returned to Shijiazhuang, used multi-track recorders to finish recording tracks of the trumpet, vocal, and bass. The recording was finally finished after the audio mix. == Songs and themes == While Ji wrote all the lyrics for the OYS album, Dong composed them. And the other members were responsible for the arrangement of parts of their own instruments. Performance of trumpet and other instruments at the ending of \\"Big Rock Smashing on the Chest\\". Trumpet is featured extensively.Guitar noise and free-jazz in \\"All the Pubs on This Planet\\"ÔºàA 30-second excerptÔºâThe first track, \\"The Hall of Dog's Urine\\", and the fifth song, \\"Summer Record of Foreign birds\\", are purely instrumental. The second track, \\"The Non-omnipotent Comedy \\", consists of only eight lines of lyrics throughout the song, and has a coda that accounts for the majority of the song's length. OYS released different versions of this song since, including an unplugged version, a pure playing version, and a trumpet-free version, which represent the traces of the band's experiment on music for almost six years. The sixth track \\"Qinhuangdao\\" was composed by Dong when he was recuperating from depression in Qinhuangdao. Ji Geng's lyrics described Dong's depression at that time. The seventh track, \\"One Hundred Thousand Hippies\\" describes the characteristics of the younger generation and Dong, and sets Dong as the main character of the song. For example, the lyrics \\"like to have a dog\\" and \\"Mr Dong, who dreamt a long dream \\" show the behaviours and characteristics that Dong had. The lyrics of this song not only have the harmonious nature of parallelism, but also interlaces long and short sentences. The eighth track, \\"All the Pubs on This Planet\\", is seen by some to have political implications, with lyrics such as \\"...singing only the love songs but seeing no tanks\\" and \\"All the pubs on This Planet...\\" which are believed to refer to 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Ji Geng, the songwriter, admitted that he replaced the word \\"square\\" with \\"pub\\" to make \\"cruel\\" things \\"relatively romantic\\". The arrangements of this song feature many instruments: starting with a blues slide, proceeding with a solo of early-style-blues, and ending with guitar noise and free jazz.SunTVÈò≥ÂÖâÊó∂Âä°.„Ää‰∏áËÉΩÈùíÂπ¥ÊóÖÂ∫óËÆøË∞à„Äã.Á¨¨ÂçÅÂõõÊúü.„ÄäÈò≥ÂÖâÊó∂Âä°„Äã.2012Âπ¥ The ninth track, \\"Kill That Man from Shijiazhuang,\\" has sparked a lot of speculation and discussion about the laid-off waves and plight of the transition led by Shijiazhuang bombings. However, Ji explained that the song was to describe a particular kind of family in during that period. == Release == In 2006, the mini-album ‚ÄúWhat are the Junkies up to?‚Äù was uploaded to the Internet, containing demos of \\"Kill That Man from Shijiazhuang\\", \\" The Non- omnipotent Comedy \\" and \\"Qinhuangdao\\", which were recorded by OYS between 2003 and 2004. Shi confirmed that a friend of the band uploaded it without the band's knowledge. In 2007, a demo of the album \\" The Non-omnipotent Comedy (unplugged) \\" was released on Pocket Music Picks 01. Before the release of the official album, the band released several bootleg recordings while touring, including live versions of the album's tracks, such as \\" Omnipotent Youth Society @mao (2007)‚Äù, \\"Live at MAO Beijing 2008\\" (2008), \\"Live at MAO Beijing 2009\\" (2009), and \\"Live at SOHO 2010\\" (2010). These bootleg albums include live versions of \\"Kill That Man from Shijiazhuang\\", \\" The Non-omnipotent Comedy\\", \\"Qinhuangdao,\\" \\"One Hundred Thousand Hippies,\\" and \\"Big Block Smashing on the Chest\\" with some of the band's unpublished songs. The CD version of the official album was originally released on November 12, 2010, by the band themselves, and the signing was hosted at the Yuyintang bar. This album has been issued three times by now. The first two editions are basically the same, and the third releases are printed on the back \\"third edition  March 2016\\".„Ää‰∏áËÉΩÈùíÂπ¥ÊóÖÂ∫ó„Äã‰∏áËÉΩÈùíÂπ¥ÊóÖÂ∫ó.‰∏áËÉΩÈùíÂπ¥ÊóÖÂ∫ó.ISRC CN-A08-09-317-00/A.J6 In July 2011, the band released a CD version of the album in Taiwan independently.„Ää‰∏áËÉΩÈùíÂπ¥ÊóÖÂ∫ó„Äã‰∏áËÉΩÈùíÂπ¥ÊóÖÂ∫ó.Êë©ÁôªÂ§©Á©∫.4712702140422 == Influence == Li Guangping, from the Chinese Music Media Awards committee commented spoke highly of OYS: \\"(OYS) is the best dark horse in the end of this year. (OYS) features folk rock and unfamiliar melodies, leaping thoughts like poetry, dense, subtle, and twisting metaphors, young and lazy singing like moans. All these features let OYS stand out among a mass of rock bands which are struggling to survive. I love their profound and imagistic thinking, such as ' lived like this for 30 years; until the building collapsed!' it's so graphic and shocking.\\" Ma Shifang, a Taiwan music critic also commented positively: \\"In just one night, you have conquered all Chinese music critics and become the saviors of Chinese rock music.\\" \\"The band has miraculously presented a united front of aesthetic standards of rock music,\\" said Zhang Xiaozhou, another music critic. Ifeng.com, Hebei:\\" In the context that Chinese rock music is gradually losing a say internationally, Wan Qing (an abbreviation of OYS) managed to restore people's faith in Chinese rock and roll, bringing back the initial feeling of being touched that rock fans once had.

The novel was first published in 1978. Consisting of three parts, The Harp, The Hand and The Shadow, the book describes many historic characters, including pope Pius XI, Christopher Columbus and pope Leo XIII. The book, Carpentier's last published work, has been considered part of the literary genres new historical fiction, Neo-Baroque and La nueva cr√≥nica de Indias, also expanding on the Borgesian concept of the text as a palimpsest. == Background == In the prologue to the book, Carpentier said that in 1937 he heard a radio program about the book The Book of Christopher Columbus by Paul Claudel in the Luxembourg Radio. According to Carpentier, he was \\"irritated\\" by the \\"attribution of supernatural virtues\\" to the explorer. He later read a book by Leon Bloy, who supported the canonization of Columbus, even comparing him to Moses and Saint Peter, following the real-life attempts to canonize and beatify Columbus by popes Pio nono and Leon XIII. == Plot == In the first part, The Harp, pope Pius XI is about to sign a decree asking the cardinals to canonize Christopher Columbus. As he holds the quill in his Vatican chambers, Pius thinks back on a trip to the New World he embarked on when he was a young priest and was still named Mastai. The trip, organized by the Vatican, was a mission to newly independent Chile. On his trip, Mastai criticizes and mocks Argentina, and especially Buenos Aires, and receives harsh treatment in Chile, rendering an overall negative impression of Latin America. After 9 months, Mastai and his party return to Italy empty-handed. In his trip, the conservative Mastai realizes Latin America needs a saint of its own that would unify it and bring it closer to the Catholic church and papacy in Rome. He comes to the conclusion that Christopher Columbus could serve that purpose. In the second part, The Hand, Christopher Columbus prepares to give a confession to a Franciscan confessor who is supposed to come see him. Columbus recounts his life in the first person, retelling his attempts to organize the first journey west in 1492 and detailing his knowledge of fantastic creatures, strange people and mythic monsters, all of which he expects to find in his journey. He also has an affair with Queen Isabelle I of Castile. In the end, Columbus does not give this revealing confession, and instead decides to \\"only say what can remain written in marble\\". In the third part, The Shadow, a seminarian and a conservationist of Vatican relics discuss the proposed beatification of Columbus, this time by Leon XIII. Both feel that this second attempt of beatification will fail, despite believing that there should be a \\"maritime saint\\" and that Columbus should become a saint. Meanwhile, The Invisible, which is the ghost of Columbus, attends an assembly by the ghosts of intellectuals and canonical figures trying to decide on his beatification. They eventually come to the conclusion that Columbus will not be made a saint. Upon hearing that he will not be made a saint, The Invisible disappears and ceases to exist. == References == Category:1978 novels Category:Novels by Alejo Carpentier ","title":"The Harp and the Shadow"},{"id":"63953832","text":"Leptospermum oreophilum, commonly known as the rock tea tree, is a shrub that is endemic to the Glass House Mountains in southern Queensland.

Featuring a danceable arrangement inspired by David Bowie, the song includes punning lyrics referencing the cigarette brand of the same name and decrying the effects of the elderly on the British welfare system. \\"Senior Service\\" was released on Armed Forces as an album track and did not get released as a single. It has since seen positive critical reception from critics. ==Background== \\"Senior Service\\" was, according to Costello, heavily influenced by textures on David Bowie's albums Station to Station, Low, and \\"Heroes\\", albums that Costello and the Attractions had been listening to regularly during the recording of Armed Forces. Costello explained, \\"The effect of [Bowie's influence] can be heard overtly in the keyboard and background voices\\" on the song. The production on the song is notably \\"crisp\\" and \\"bright\\"; with a stop-start drum part from Pete Thomas and a keyboard line from Steve Nieve that has been compared to ABBA, the song's arrangement is notably dance-friendly. Lyrically, \\"Senior Service\\" references both the Royal Navy and the cigarette brand of the same name, a brand marketed toward middle- class suburbanites. The cigarette brand was a favorite of Costello producer Nick Lowe. Wordplay related to the cigarette brand can be seen in lyrics such as \\"It's the breath you took too late/It's the death that's worse than fate\\". According to Geoffrey Himes of The Washington Post, the song \\"assaults older workers who clog up Britain's seniority-based social system\\". ==Release and reception== \\"Senior Service\\" was released as the second track on Armed Forces in January 1979.

AllMusic's Stewart Mason described it as \\"the epitome of Costello's early angry young man phase\\", noting that the \\"juvenile spite\\" coming from \\"the deliberately ridiculous rinky-dink melody\\" makes the track \\"feel really good, and so there's something primitively cathartic about the song\\". Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic called it one of \\"the quirkiest songs [Costello has] ever written\\", while Ryan Cormier of The News Journal called it \\"a hidden gem\\". Writer Greil Marcus described the song as \\"a vicious mix of sexual jealousy and terror - in fact the Terror with Costello as Madame Defarge.\\" ==Live history== \\"Senior Service\\" has been infrequently performed live by Costello, most recently at a 2014 concert in Wilmington, Delaware.

The pacht was an outsourced tax operation, collecting customs, excise and indirect duties on behalf of the Dutch colonial government. The five partners of the consortium were the pachters Lauw Ho, Gouw Kang Soei, Luitenant-titulair der Chinezen, Tan Ling, Khouw Siong Bo and Tan Kong Boen. The name of the kongsi refers to the five generals of the 14th- century Chinese classic novel, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Of all colonial-era pachten, opium was by far the most lucrative; and the five partners of Ngo Ho Tjiang were consequently among the wealthiest and most powerful tycoons of early to mid-nineteenth century Java. Ngo Ho Tjiang had very close ties to the colonial Chinese bureaucracy. One of the partners, Luitenant-titulair Gouw Kang Soei, sat on the Kong Koan ('Chinese Council') of Batavia, while the consortium's administrator, Lim Soe Keng Sia, was a son-in- law of Tan Eng Goan, the 1st Majoor der Chinezen of Batavia and the city's most senior Chinese official. ==References== Category:Partnerships Category:History of taxation Category:Taxation in Indonesia Category:Abolished taxes Category:Pachter ","title":"Ngo Ho Tjiang"},{"id":"63953909","text":"Charles Johnson DeLand (December 18, 1879January 10, 1943) was a Michigan politician. ==Early life== Charles J.

Lim later mailed the revolver to a newspaper editor, appending a letter which stated, \\"As a measure of self defence, I took the revolver and ran away. I could have shot at the detective while he was down but what for?\\" In September 1966, he shot and wounded in the leg Detective Allan Lee at the Odeon Cinema in North Bridge Road. A $2,000 bounty was announced by authorities in October 1966. On 23 June 1968, Lim shot and killed Corporal Koh Chong Thye with a semi-automatic pistol; Koh and two other police officers had been in pursuit of Lim after he was spotted in Serangoon. Koh, who was married with two children when he died, suffered gunshots to the chest and face and a fatal one through the forehead. The two other officers gave chase but Lim escaped and went into hiding, reportedly finding safe haven in the nearby countries of Indonesia, Thailand, and China. A nation-wide manhunt was announced by the Singapore Police Force, whose Criminal Investigation Department began organising more raids in the hopes of capturing Lim. An initial reward of $5,000 was also offered. The bounty was raised to $10,000 in March 1969 and a record $17,000 by November 1972. ==Personal life== Reportedly tall and of Hokkien descent, Lim was an ambidextrous shooter. To disguise himself, he reportedly cross-dressed and underwent plastic surgery. He went by many aliases, including Tua Hong Li, Tau Hong Lim, Seow Lim, Ah Seow, Suay Kia, Oei Kia, Ah Oei, Jipun Kai, and Botak. He married his childhood sweetheart, a \\"Madam Yeo\\", in 1956 when he was aged 16. They had three daughters and two sons. After his death in 1972, Lim's family claimed that they had not seen him in some seven years. In December 1977, Lim's brother Ah Tee (born 1952) sustained serious injuries after being stabbed in the thigh and head by a mob of ten youths. Four of his friends were injured too. Another of Lim's siblings, Ah Lek, speculated that Ah Tee was attacked for his affiliation with Lim. ==Death== Lim had previously boasted to the police over the telephone: \\"You will never catch me. When you are about to arrest me, I will surely engage you in a gunfight. I will use the last bullet to end my life, so you can only collect my body.\\" In November 1972, Lim returned to Singapore with his right-hand man Chua Ah Kow. At the time, he was the most wanted fugitive in Singapore. On 24 November, Lim and Chua visited the pasar malam at Margaret Drive in Queenstown. Officers from the Rural West Division of the Singapore Police Force already had intelligence on their whereabouts. At about 8:15 pm local time, they were spotted by a team of six police officers lying in wait. The team was led by Deputy Superintendent Henry Edwards of Bukit Panjang Police Station. Lim attempted to escape by separating from Chua but was shot and killed by the police. Lim suffered three gunshots to the body and reportedly staggered for some before dying. Lim was aged 32 at the time of his death. Although authorities were initially uncertain if the deceased was Lim, as he had changed his hairstyle and put on weight, he was positively identified by his fingerprints. A revolver, thirteen bullets, $1.40 in cash, as well as a stolen identity card belonging to a 30-year-old Lim Kian Hua, were on his person when he died. An unnamed police officer was also killed during the shootout. Detective Chow Kim Loo was later publicly identified as the officer who fired the fatal shot that hit Lim in the neck. Chua managed to evade capture that night but committed suicide during a shootout with the police three weeks later at Tank Road on 17 December 1972. ==Aftermath== On 25 November 1972, 33 inmates escaped from the Ulu Bedok Reformative Training Centre. They had reportedly escaped to attend Lim's funeral, although the recaptured inmates later denied this by claiming that they were simply unsatisfied with the living conditions in the centre. Lim was buried on 28 November 1972 at Choa Chu Kang Cemetery. Following Lim's death, the Arms Offences Act was enacted in 1973, making the use or attempted use of firearms to cause harm punishable by death. Lim was reportedly the first criminal in Singapore to have evaded justice by undergoing plastic surgery; a second case was reported in November 1981. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== Category:1972 deaths Category:Singaporean murderers Category:Date of birth missing Category:1940s births Category:People shot dead by law enforcement officers Category:Bank robbers ","title":"Lim Ban Lim"},{"id":"63954048","text":"Xie Bingcan (1934 - 2020) was a notable expert and teacher of Qigong, Tuina, and Taijiquan. == Biography == Xie Bingcan was born in Yuyao, China. At twenty years old, he traveled on foot from Yuyao to Shanghai, to find work at the Shanghai Mechanized Construction Group. While supporting himself there as a mechanic, Xie devoted his spare hours to the study of Daoist qigong and martial arts. His workmates were so impressed by his dedication, they assigned him a nickname: \\"Maoshan Dao Shr.\\" Xie Bingcan demonstrates \\"White Crane Spreads Wings\\"In 1958, Xie joined the Yongnian Taijiquan Association, led by the Tai Chi master Fu Zhongwen. Xie focused all his efforts on this martial art. Following the instructions of his teacher, Xie repeated the traditional Yang style form ten to twelve times in a row without rest. He performed this feat twice daily, morning and evening, for many years. During this period in his life, Xie often slept only three to four hours each night. With the support of Fu Zhongwen, Xie started to assist in teaching push hands at the Yongnian Association. Xie made a point to spend one or two minutes with each student, and to give feedback on their performance. During a typical class, he would tutor sixty to eighty pupils. Xie also traveled with Fu inside China, and as his senior student, occasionally answered challenges on his behalf. Gradually, Xie's reputation grew, and in 1980 he was invited to join the faculty at East China Normal University. He offered teaching in Yang style Taijiquan sword and saber, as well as the hand form and push hands. Xie also served as a competition judge for the Shanghai Wushu Association, and as a contributing member of the International Qigong Research Association, among other posts and honors. Despite having built a reputation as an expert himself, Xie continued to seek new insights and perspectives. Starting in 1987, Xie advanced his long-established study of Wu style Taijiquan under the personal instruction of Ma Yueliang and Wu Yinghua. After a favorable mention in the April 1990 issue of T'ai Chi Magazine, Xie was finally recognized by the English-speaking Taiji community. Students began traveling from the United States and elsewhere to seek his instruction. Four years later, he moved to Bothell, Washington, joining an active Chinese martial arts community in the greater Seattle area. Xie Bingcan continued teaching his beloved art, and preparing the next generation of Taijiquan masters, until his death at age 85. == Publications == == References == == External links == Category:Chinese tai chi practitioners Category:Martial arts writers Category:1934 births Category:2020 deaths ","title":"Xie Bingcan"},{"id":"63954062","text":"I Shing Temple Interior of I Shing Temple Che Kung altar with pinwheels in I Shing Temple.

The attack was part of Operation Unokat which aimed to break the roadblocks set up by the gendarmerie by the end of November 1961 and at the same time stop Katangese President Mo√Øse Tshombe's opposition to the UN. In a coordinated offensive, Swedish troops captured Camp Massart; Irish troops attacked the railway tunnel; the Indian contingent created diversionary attacks and blocked fleeing Katangese forces; and the Ethiopian forces secured the western part of the city. The attack on Camp Massart begun in the early hours of 16 December and ended at around 1 pm when the Swedes captured the camp. Between 10 and 20 Gendarmes were killed in the attack. One Swedish soldier was killed and five were injured. ==The attack== The 1st Brigade, which was under the command of Colonel Jonas W√¶rn, consisted of the Swedish and the Irish battalion. The Swedish battalion, led by Major Ulf Mide, included two platoons of the 3rd Company from the old 12th Battalion under Major Robert Ekengren of Dalarna Regiment. One platoon from the old 1st Company was in the operation under Ekengren's command. It also included two companies of the newly arrived 14th Battalion. One anti-aircraft squad with 20 mm AA automatic guns had been added. The battalion's goal was to capture the gendarmerie main base, Camp Massart. At 03.00 am, the battalion went into attack position. The 3rd Company's platoon Gullstrand constituted the advance party. At 03.40 am, nine mortars started firing (Indian, Irish and Swedish) which lasted for 35 minutes. 940 grenades were fired and of these grenades, 168 were fired in rafale for 10 minutes. The advance began and an extraordinarily strong tropical downpour filled in a few minutes the Kapemba stream which became a rushing river. The advance party got with difficulty wading across; a machine-gun squad moved the heavy Ksp m/42 machine gun across using a floating door. The rest of the company had to look toward the only bridge that existed. The new 1st Company that went to the left got over with the help of a rope. The new 2nd Company, which went to the right, managed to find a small boat. The attack was delayed. The advance took place under heavy enemy fire from mortars and machine guns, and from snipers in the buildings' upper floors. Some houses got cleaned out using armor piercing explosive shells, fired by Carl Gustaf recoilless rifle gunner Andersson from Sk√∂vde. The recoilless rifle gunner in the platoon Kamstedt, Lars Frost, excelled during the operation. Sub-machine guns and hand grenades were suitable close- quarters combat weapons for urban warfare. The Swedes were unable to use their vehicles which were stuck in the mud. Instead, they stormed the bridge, which was under fire from Camp Massart. By 08.30 the distance was close enough, 30 meters from the Camp Massart's main entrance, which was partially blocked, for the Swedes to make a charge. The advance party (Gullstrand) secured the flanks with two machine guns and 3rd Company's 2nd Platoon (Kamstedt) stormed into the big military base. The Swedes stormed straight for the main entrance, which they captured after a fierce hand-to-hand fighting. The Gendarmes now regrouped and at 09.30 they went into a violent counter-attack. The attack was directed against the Swedes' left flank and was supported by fire from the surrounding houses inhabited by European employees of the Katangan railway company B C K. The Gendarmes attacked with rage and the Swedes again entered into hand-to-hand fighting. At 1 pm, the UN headquarters announced that the Swedes had definitely captured the area around the main entrance but that it would take the whole day would to clear the rest of Camp Massart. A few hours later, however, it was announced that Camp Massart had fallen and that the Swedes had complete control over the Katangese stronghold. ==Aftermath== Two days of lighter battles followed with the clearing of other resistance strongholds in the city. On 18 December Secretary-General U Thant declared a unilateral ‚Äòtemporary ceasefire‚Äô and Tshombe began to negotiate with the central government. During the December fightings, three Swedes were killed, while 13 were wounded. A moderate figure in accordance with professional analysts, given the opponent's firepower. During the attack on Camp Massart, one Swedish soldier was killed, private Lars Erik √ñhrberg, and a handful was wounded. In total during the December fightings, 21 UN troops were killed and 84 wounded. Among the Katangans, 206 Gendarmes were killed and an unknown number wounded. The 12th Swedish Battalion was demobilized and flown back to Sweden where the Army Command received them. ==Footnotes== ==References== ==Further reading== * * Category:Congo Crisis Category:Battles involving Sweden Category:Conflicts in 1961 Massart Category:Mercenary warfare Category:1960s in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:United Nations operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:History of Katanga ","title":"Attack on Camp Massart"},{"id":"63954308","text":"The first case of the COVID-19 pandemic in India was reported on 30 January 2020, originating from China.
