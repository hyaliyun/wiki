Chengtian Temple is considered one of the Three Great Buddhist Temples in Quanzhou, alongside Kaiyuan Temple and Chongfu Temple. History Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms The temple was first built between 957 and 958 with the name of \\"South Chan Temple\\" (), under the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms (907-960). It was the South Garden of Liu Congxiao (), a military governor in the Southern Tang dynasty (937-976). Song dynasty In 1007, in the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song dynasty (960-1279), the emperor inscribed and honored the name \\"Chengtian Temple\\" (). Republic of China In 1947, Chan master Guangqin () went to Taiwan to disseminate Buddhism and deliver Buddhist precepts, where he erected the Miaotong Temple, Jinhai Chan Temple, Hengguang Chan Temple, and Guangzhao Temple. People's Republic of China In 1966, Mao Zedong launched the ten- year Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards had attacked the temple, the Hall of Maitreya, Dharma Hall, Bell tower, Drum tower, corridor, hallway, pavilions, and pagodas were suffered minor or severe damages. They were then converted into residential buildings and faculty. After the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the policy of religious freedom was implemented. Chan master Hongchuan () returned to Quanzhou and started to restore Chengtian Temple. Renovations and rebuilding to the main buildings (including Mahavira Hall, Dharma Hall, Hall of Maitreya) began in 1985 and were completed in October 1990. The then Venerable Master of the Buddhist Association of China Zhao Puchu attended the consecration ceremony. Chengtian Temple was inscribed to the Quanzhou Municipal Cultural Heritage List by the Quanzhou Municipal Government in June 1961. The Stone Dhvaja of Chengtian Temple was listed among the sixth group of Fujian Provincial Historical and Cultural Sites by the Fujian Provincial Government on May 11, 2005.

Erste Abteilung: Darstellung. Kapitel Neun: Die Preussische M√ºnzpolitik. p. 231 As master of the mints in Prussia, he implemented a major coin reform, with the goal of implementing a new monetary standard to promote trade, increase seigniorage income and elevate the Prussian coins to the status of a reserve currency. Graumann was portrayed by his contemporaries as a dreamer, but with only a slight modification his coin standard remained in place in Germany until 1907. Life Karl I von Braunschweig-Wolfenb√ºttel by Johann Conrad Eichler Not much is known about Graumann's early life, but for many years his father was in the service of Augustus William, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg as Graumann states in his second publication dedicated to his brother Louis Rudolph, Duke of Brunswick- L√ºneburg. Obviously, Graumann visited a gymnasium. At the beginning of his career, he was specializing in the arbitrage of exchange, c.q. the simultaneous purchase and sale of foreign exchanges in two or more markets to profit from discrepancies in quotations. Graumann was influenced by Christlieb von Clausberg, after publishing his Demonstrative Rechenkunst, Oder Wissenschaft, gr√ºndlich und kurz zu rechnen. Graumann claimed to be the inventor of the commercial chain rule, which he was not. Graumann lived in Hamburg (1730-1734) and in Amsterdam (1737-1740) and worked for the main Amsterdam merchant houses. (According to Willem Kersseboom, a financial expert, he came from Electorate of Hanover and arrived in Amsterdam around 1720, which is hard to prove.Inventaris van het archief van Willem Kersseboom, 1720-1771 (1788) http://proxy.handle.net/10648/3c0854fd-7f2f-4a69-93dd-4d23102cea1c) He dedicated his fifth book to the Amsterdam burgomaster Daniel Hooft. On 26 January 1742, he was appointed by Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel as M√ºnzmeister. In Braunschweig, his task was to increase the income of the Treasury and the volume of trade. Graumann was assisted in his task by Martin Kr√∂ncke. During the Austrian War of Succession a shortage of small coins existed all over Europe. In 1747 Graumann introduced a debased Albertustaler; he wanted to compete with the Dutch who used the Albertustaler to pay in the Baltic countries. In 1748/1749 he lived in Spain, working on his next book. In 1749 he published his groundbreaking Abdruck eines Schreibens, die Teutsche und anderer V√∂lker M√ºnzverfassung, insonderheit die hochf√ºrstliche Braunschweigische M√ºnze zu den Annehmlichkeiten betreffend,The quintessence of the book can be found in par. 189‚Äì206. In par. 74 he wrote he was living in Spain. in which he described a plan to reform the mint and abandon the prevailing Leipzig standard for silver coins (= 12 thalers per Cologne fine mark). The book brought the activities of the Brunswick mint officials to the attention of the Prussian King Frederick II. His ideas about gold, which was 4% overvalued, were accepted by the government in Brunswick and by Frederick, but not by Julius Melchior Strube, who wrote a reply for the government in Churhannover, c.q. George II of England.Michael Paul Baumhauers Rechtsgelehrten, Versuch eines Neuen und richtigen Lehr-Geb√§udes der Politischen M√ºnz-Wissenschaft im Grund-Risse: zum Vortheil der Eink√ºnfte gro√üer Herren, zum Nutzen der ganzen Handelschaft, und zum Besten des deutschen gemeinen Wesens entworfen: nebst einer Vertheidigung des hohen M√ºnz- Fu√ües, p. 49-51 Graumann currency reform In the middle the Friedrichswerder city counsel (nr. 25) can be seen.

Map of the area today, with the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in red, on the same spot as the old mint. M√ºnzst√§tte Berlin Until 1750, the Prussian minting industry was composed of semi-private enterprises run by mintmasters. Thereafter, mint directors in the service of the crown took over the management of Prussian mints. In 1750 Prussia had two, even three coin standards, which was very disturbing for the administration and especially for the payment of the silver deliveries.F. von Schr√∂tter, p. 93 On 23 January 1750, Graumann was appointed as Frederick's confidential adviser on finance, military affairs, and royal possessions, as well as the Director-General of all mint facilities in Berlin, Breslau, Kleve, Aurich, K√∂nigsberg, Magdeburg and Stettin. Graumann had two main tasks: first, he was to secure the availability of coin silver for the Prussian monetary system; second, he was to eliminate the currency chaos of the Austrian War of Succession and rationalize the Prussian coinage. Prussia adopted a Prussian thaler containing of a Cologne mark of silver, rather than (as under the Leipzig standard), probably in the expectation that this realistic coin foot would prevail throughout the empire. This new standard was referred to as the Graumann coin standard. Graumann announced that he would be able to achieve high coin seignorage for the state and that Berlin would become the largest exchange center in Central and Northern Europe, taking away the banking and minting profits that were then accruing to the Dutch. In 1750, silver - for half a million thalers - was purchased in London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt am Main for the mint facility of Berlin. By April 1751 there was enough new money for it to function as a circulating medium. The metal content of the new ‚ÄúReichsthalers\\" was equal or close to their face value. All contracts, bonds and bills of exchange were to be made out only in new [Prussian] money, otherwise they were legally unenforceable.F. von Schr√∂tter (1902‚Äì13) Das preussische M√ºnzwesen im 18. Jahrhundert, p. 167 At the end of May 1751, the \\"Generalkassen\\", customs and post offices were ordered to make the payments as far as possible in new money. In 1752 a new mint facility was built in the M√ºnzstrasse (Spandauer Vorstadt), and Graumann increased the mint personnel tenfold, but he lacked silver to make this operation profitable.F. von Schr√∂tter (1908), p. 79‚Äì81, 113 On 2 September he arranged silver a contract with Veitel Heine Ephraim.Quellen zur Geschichte der Juden in den Archiven der neuen Bundesl√§nder. Geheimes Staatsarchiv Preu√üischer Kulturbesitz, Teil I: √Ñltere Zentralbeh√∂rden bis 1808/10 und Brandenburg-Preu√üisches Hausarchiv (1999), p. 96 In 1753 he introduced the nominal \\"Achtgutegroschen\\", which was cheaper by its 3% lowered \\"M√ºnzfu√ü\\" in the production.http://www.tempelhofer- muenzenhaus.de/downloads/153_29x236.pdf Dissatisfied with Graumann's performance, Frederick decided to negotiate the silver supply contracts himself.F. von Schr√∂tter, p. 123, 130, 139, 141 In 1753 Graumann proposed a central bank, combining an exchange bank, a lending bank, and a note-issuing bank into one institution as a way of attracting additional silver to Prussia.William Roberds & Fran√ßois R. Velde (2014) Early Public Banks, Working Paper http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7306.html This proposal ran into strong opposition from local, Breslau and Hamburg merchant-bankers and was not implemented. Because the profits of the mint facilities did not meet Frederick's goals, Graumann was dismissed early 1755,F. von Schr√∂tter, p. 135, 136, 139, 144; H. Rachel & P. Wallich, p. 521 and not allowed to disseminate his knowledge.Jan Greitens (2017) Geldtheorie und -politik in Preu√üen Mitte des 18. Jahrhunderts, p. 6 The mess created with massive amounts of coins (Scheidem√ºnzen) was obvious; exchanging coins became an art. What happened next The square C√∂llnischer Fischmarkt (‚ÄúC√∂lln fish market‚Äù) with the town hall constructed between 1710 and 1723 after plans of Martin Gr√ºnberg. In the background the Petrikirche in baroque style. (1784) After Graumann's fall the lease of the Prussian mint at K√∂nigsberg was transferred to Moses Fr√§nkel and Veitel Heine Ephraim. Their success in K√∂nigsberg was so great that under similar conditions they were given the lease of the mints of Aurich and Cleves.S. Stern, p. 233-234 Moses Gumpertz, Moses Isaak and Daniel Itzig leased the mint in Berlin. At the beginning of the Seven Years' War, the king's need for revenue rose sharply. Saxony was invaded by Prussia not least because of its wealthy silver mines near Freiberg. As the war continued Frederick agreed to reductions in the precious metal content of his coins in order to get as high a coinage as possible. In 1756 Ephraim became operator of the Leipzig mint facility; in 1757 also in Dresden and in 1758 of all the mint facilities in Saxony and Prussia together with Itzig. The Graumann coin standard was abandoned in 1758 in Saxony; at 1 January 1759 in Prussia.F. von Schr√∂tter, p. 104, 114 In April 1759 Graumann discussed with Ephraim the old and Mittelfriedrich d'or and the agio.F. von Schr√∂tter, p. 106 Ephraim and Itzig produced millions of debased coins known as Ephraimiten. In Poland were no coins minted throughout the 18th century and consequently, it became an ideal dumping ground for the devalued coins. Frederick's debased coins were an inspiration to many other German principalities, who inflated their currencies as well. Rival mints in Harzgerode (1760) in Anhalt-Bernburg, Quedlinburg in Sachsen-Anhalt (1761), Schwerin in Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1761), Neustrelitz in Mecklenburg-Strelitz, (1762) and Rethwisch in the Duchy of Holstein (1762) were forcibly closed or acquired by Prussia, c.q. by Ephraim as undesired competition.B.

In: Jahrbuch f√ºr die Geschichte Mittel- und Ostdeutschlands, Band 59F. von Schr√∂tter, p. 87-89 By 1760 the price of silver that had to be bought from the Wisselbank in Amsterdam rose from 19 to 28 and 34 Reichsthaler per Mark.F. von Schr√∂tter, p. 36, 51, 62 From November 1761 most foreign \\"Kriegsgeld\\" was no longer accepted in Prussia and Saxony, only if it was melted. An exception was made for the coins minted in Anhalt-Bernburg, which were used to buy silver in Amsterdam and Hamburg.B. Kluge (2013) F√ºr das √úberleben des Staates, p. 141-142F. von Schr√∂tter, p. 85 In April 1762 the 56-year old Graumann died of a digestion disease, like many other people in Berlin. He was buried in Petrikirche (Berlin-C√∂lln). His widow was Johanna Christina Hersin from Hessen, whom he had married in May 1750. Conclusion Frederick never shied away from responsibility for Prussian inflation, which many historians have characterized as a form of state-sponsored counterfeiting.B. Kluge (2013) F√ºr das √úberleben des Staates, p. 125, 142F. von Schr√∂tter, p. 70 He saw it as the only means of procuring the cash needed for warfare without imposing too heavy a tax burden on his subjects.S. Stern, p. 249 How many coins were actually minted and what the total income from this inflation was, is unknown.F. von Schr√∂tter, p. 44 Documents exist only for the mint in Dresden from February 1758 to May 1759.S. Stern, p. 241F. von Schr√∂tter, p. 42 According to Jan Greitens \\"Graumann and Justi were trapped in the situation of a divided Germany, in which many states had the right of coinage and devalued the coins to generate income.\\" After his dismissal by Frederick Graumann lived for the rest of his life in Palais am Festungsgraben (till World War II headquarters of the Prussian Finance Ministry). Some of his books were translated into French.Biographie universelle, ancienne et moderne; ou, Histoire, par ..., Band 18 Graumann corresponded with the Scottish mercantilist James Steuart (economist) and produced a number of essays on the relationship between gold and silver. Graumann \\"Gesammelte Briefe\\" contains the best contemporary discussion of the coinage situation. Before the Seven Years' War silver was cheaper and gold more expensive in Germany than anywhere else, according to Graumann. He seemed to believe that if Prussia only minted as many coins as the Dutch Republic, then Prussia could also circulate coins at such a high value. He is very precise in his descriptions but is lacking in some modern economic concepts. In Graumann's view there were two successful coin \\"exporters\\": France and the Dutch Republic. France because it was a large country and prohibited all foreign coin. The Netherlands because everyone traded coins and bills there, in part because of the system of receipts at the Wisselbank, but in part just because everyone agreed that Amsterdam was the place for such business. \\"In the long run, Graumann's export of money without the export of goods was inadequate to control the rate of exchange.\\" On 1 December 1763 Graumann's successor became Martin Kr√∂ncke, former mintmaster in Breslau. The Graumann coin standard was reintroduced and widespread in all of northern and central Germany.This provided as the main component of the reintroduction of the 14-thaler foot for currency money and the 18-thaler foot for minor coins. Frederick II signed the ruling on March 29, 1764, which came into force on 1 June. Graumann's ideas formed the basis for the introduction of a uniform German coinage system in the 19th century.

The bridge was designed by Harvey Dare and built in 1929. The bridge is owned by Roads and Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000.  History  Timber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction. Timber truss bridges were preferred by the Public Works Department from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at Newcastle in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England. Harvey Dare, the designer of Dare truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer in the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW. Timber truss bridges and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travelers as the \\"timber bridge state\\".  Description  Coonamit Bridge is a Dare type timber truss road bridge. It has two timber truss spans, each of . There are five approach spans at one end and two at the other, giving the bridge an overall length of . The superstructure is supported by timber trestles and provides a carriage way with a minimum width of . The guard rail is of timber post and rail construction and extends the full length of the bridge.  Condition  2018, the physical condition is good and intact.  Heritage listing  The Coonamit Bridge is a Dare type timber truss bridge that was completed in 1929. In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Harvey Dare, the designer of this type of truss. Dare trusses were fifth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. They were similar to Allan trusses, but contain improvements which make them stronger and easier to maintain. This engineering enhancement represents a significant evolution of the design of timber truss bridges, and gives Dare trusses some technical significance. In 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Coonamit bridge is a representative example of Dare timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance. The Coonamit Bridge over Wakool River was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000, having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Through the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Harvey Dare, it has historical significance. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Timber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \\"timber truss bridge state\\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The Coonamit bridge is valued only for its utility by the local population. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Rare - In 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Coonamit Bridge is also the last timber truss bridge built in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. This bridge is a representative of Dare truss bridges.

Along with tumbang preso, it is one of the most popular outdoor games played by children in the Philippines. Etymology Patintero is derived from Spanish word tinte (\\"tint\\" or \\"ink\\") in reference to the drawn lines. Another name for it is tubigan, tubiganay, or tubig-tubig (\\"water [game]\\"), due to the fact that the grid lines are also commonly drawn by wetting the ground with water. It is also known as harangang-taga or harang- taga (lit. \\"block and catch\\"), referring to the game mechanics. Other names for the game include lumplumpas (Igorot), sabatan (Kapampangan), sinibon or serbab (Ilokano), and tadlas (for four players) or birus-birus (for six players) in eastern Visayas. Description Patintero is played on a rectangular grid drawn into the ground. The rectangle is usually in length, and wide. It is subdivided into four to six equal parts by drawing a central lengthwise line and then one or two crosswise lines. The size of the rectangle and the number of subdivisions can be adjusted based on the number of players. The individual squares in the grid must be large enough that someone can stay in the middle out of reach of someone standing on the lines. Two teams are needed, each with around two to six players. One team acts as the taggers, the other acts as the runners. This is usually decided by a game of rock‚Äìpaper‚Äìscissors (jak-en-poy) or a coin toss. The object of the game is to cross the rectangle back and forth without getting tagged. One tagger is usually assigned per crosswise line. Taggers can only move along their respective lines, with the exception of the tagger on the first line who is regarded as the team leader (patotot). Unlike the other taggers, the patotot can also move along the central lengthwise line. Taggers can tag runners at any time, including those already past them, but both of their feet must always be on the lines. Tagging a runner when none or only one foot is contacting the line is not counted. Runners can cross at any time and to any adjacent square, however, they can only exit the playing rectangle at both ends of the rectangle. Once a runner is tagged, they are out and will sit out the match until the next game. Teams score points when they complete isang gabi (\\"one night\\"), a full circuit of the playing rectangle, from one end to the other and back again. Once all the runners have been tagged, the teams reverse roles, with the taggers now becoming the runners and vice versa. In some versions of the game, the match ends if even only one runner is tagged. In others, this only applies if the patotot of the team is tagged. In modern versions, there is also sometimes a time limit for how long runners can attempt to score points. The match ends once the time is up, regardless if no points have been scored.

Westmead Chick trained by Nick Savva was voted Greyhound of the Year after winning the Oaks, Arc, Brighton Belle, Olympic and the Midland Flat. Joyful Tidings was voted Irish Greyhound of the Year after winning the 1994 Irish Greyhound Derby. Tony Meek won a second successive English Greyhound Derby following the victory of Moral Standards. John McGee won the Greyhound Trainer of the Year for the seventh successive year. McGee was then involved in a major controversy after losing his licence following a positive urine test for a greyhound called Rabatino in the Peterborough Derby final. The NGRC heard the evidence and ruled that he should be suspended for the offence which led to an court battle. A high court judge overturned the NGRC suspension just weeks before he claimed his seventh crown but the NGRC in turn would then fight that ruling imposing the sanction. McGee returned to Ireland to train and would not be seen in NGRC racing again for four years. Tracks Cradley Heath closed. Brent Walker completed the sale of Hackney Wick Stadium to Fleetfoot Racing. News The Greyhound Racing Association (GRA) allowed Slippy Corner to participate in the Laurels, which signalled the end of their policy on disqualification and brought them in line with NGRC rules. Previously any greyhound disqualified was not allowed to compete on a GRA track, whereas under NGRC rules you were allowed a second chance. BAGS racing continued to grow with fixtures increasing and the betting shop service offering racing all day long. Walthamstow earned their first BAGS contract. Kevin Wilde replaced the GRA's Jarvis Astaire on the NGRC promoters association. John Coleman sealed the trainer's championship at Walthamstow and Linda Jones made a breakthrough after gaining a contract at Romford.

Australian born Frightful Flash began stud duties after leaving his quarantine kennels in Somerset on 16 February, his keeper Michael Dunne experienced significant success following the decision to bring the greyhound to the UK and Ireland from Australia. Competitions In the final of the Scottish Greyhound Derby at Shawfield Stadium the Irish trained Droopys Sandy broke the track record and propelled him to ante post favouritism for the English Derby but the black dog missed the event.

George lost patience with his generals‚Äô decision, detached 4,000 men from the siege force and circled Ganja, from the plain alongside the river Kura, to attack from behind.Georgian National Academy of Sciences, Kartlis Tskhovreba (History of Georgia), Artanuji pub. Tbilisi 2014 The Ganja garrison realized George‚Äôs vulnerability: 10,000 well-armed men left the citadel and attacked. The ensuing fighting, although the Georgians won, caused heavy casualties.RAYFIELD, D. (2012). Edge of empires: a history of Georgia. London, Reaktion Books. Because Ganja‚Äôs besieged citizens were starving, Uzbek called for a truce. The atabeg of Ganja was compelled to continue paying the tribute and acknowledge himself a subject of Georgia. George IV was reprimanded and had to apologize when the military authorities scolded him for his wayward and willful behavior.

For fifteen years she appeared at Covent Garden and at the Haymarket theatres where she was a popular comedian. Life She is thought to have been born with the name Lydia Child in 1736 or 1737 (Some give her name as Lucia). She first came to notice in 1764 when she made her acting debut in Norwich. The following year she was working in Colchester when she is said to have interceded to save the job of \\"Plausible Jack\\" Palmer. In 1772 she was acting in Edinburgh where she was using the name of \\"Mrs Day\\" although in 1774 she was using the name of Mrs Dicky Webb and she was in Scotland until 1779. She was now known for comedy roles although she also appeared in Shakespeare plays. She played Mrs Malaprop, Mrs Peachum in The Beggar's Opera and also appeared in The Recruiting Officer, Love for Love, She Stoops to Conquer and The School for Scandal. She had an adopted daughter and possibly a son. Her daughter was introduced to the stage in England in 1788 but she made her name as \\"Mrs Wilmot\\" in America. She was said to be the second most popular actress in America and a favourite of General Washington. She appeared at Covent Garden and at the Haymarket theatres where she was one of the most popular comedians for fifteen years. In 1787 she appeared as \\"Mrs Dove\\" in Cumberland's comedy and she was recorded in this role in her Samuel de Wilde painting. Legacy In 1790 she published her \\"Secret History of the Green Room\\" which was an autobiography. In 1833 Samuel De Wilde exhibited a painting of her which is now in the possession on the Garrick Club. Webb had a daughter who is referred to as Lucia or Lydia who also acted but with less success than her mother.

He is credited with inventing the \\"dawn raid\\" which enabled companies to build up a stake in a takeover target before the target had the chance to react. He was described by the Financial Times as a \\"gentleman banker\\", and one of the last of \\"an almost extinct breed\\" from the pre-Big Bang era. Early life Peter Wilmot-Sitwell was born in Kent on 28 March 1935 to Robert Bradshaw Wilmot-Sitwell (born 1894), a Royal Navy officer, and Barbara Elizabeth Fisher of New Zealand. He hardly knew his father due to his naval service during the Second World War and his early death in 1946 from cancer. Peter was educated at West Downs preparatory school in Winchester, and then at Eton College and the University of Oxford (1955‚Äì58 BA, MA) where he obtained a third class degree in modern history and a half- blue in fencing for which he also represented England. His education was interrupted by national service in the Coldstream Guards from 1953 to 1955 that he enjoyed so much that he had to be persuaded by his mother to go on to Oxford.Peter Wilmot-Sitwell obituary. The Times, 28 June 2018. Retrieved 1 July 2018. Career Wilmot-Sitwell started his banking career as a trainee at Hambros Bank in 1958, before becoming a partner at the age of 25 in 1959 at Rowe & Pitman (R & P). He was senior partner there from 1982 to 1986. He claimed that he got the job at such a young age due to his social background rather than for anything he knew and that young well-connected partners like him were known in the firm as \\"orchids\\" because they were \\"beautiful but utterly useless\\". He is credited with inventing the \\"dawn raid\\" in 1979 or 1980 when he assembled 30 of his staff to call large shareholders in Consolidated Gold Fields as soon as the market opened and offer to buy their shares at a premium to the then market price on behalf of R & P's clients Anglo-American Corporation and De Beers Consolidated Mines. The raid purchased more than ¬£100m of Consolidated stock and enabled his clients to build up a stake in their takeover target before it had a chance to react. He carried out a similar raid on Eagle Star soon after, although neither resulted in a full takeover of the intended target. A notable deal was in 1987 when Wilmot- Sitwell recruited Robert Maxwell, who already had a bad reputation in the City and would normally not have been considered, to back the difficult flotation of Eurotunnel and secured funding of ¬£25m from him. He was joint chairman of the merchant bank S.G. Warburg from 1986 to 1990, and chairman from 1990 to 1994. His other appointments included chairman of Merrill Lynch (formerly Mercury) World Mining Trust from 1993 to 2006, and board appointments to W. H. Smith, The Stock Exchange, Minorco, Foreign & Colonial Income Growth Investment Trust, Close Brothers, Southern Africa Investors, and Anglo American.Wilmot-Sitwell, Peter Sacheverell.

He was described as notably polite but with a quick temper that the Financial Times characterised as smacking of his army experience on the parade ground. Despite his third class degree, his colleague Sir David Scholey described him as shrewd and \\"daunting to work against\\". Wilmot- Sitwell's career straddled the period in which British financial services moved from a business based on trust and self-regulation where, he recalled, \\"people wouldn't do business with people they didn't know socially\\" and firms were \\"ruled by the governor of the Bank of England's eyebrows\\", to a far more regulated environment by the end of his career. The Financial Times described him as a \\"gentleman banker\\", one of the last of \\"an almost extinct breed\\" from the pre-Big Bang era. Personal life Wilmot-Sitwell married Clare Veronica Cobbold (LVO 1991) in 1960, with whom he had two sons and one daughter. One of his sons is the banker Alex Wilmot-Sitwell. His home was at Portman House, Dummer, near Basingstoke. His hobbies were shooting, golf, and tennis. He was a member of White's club and Swinley Forest Golf Club in Ascot.

It was signed by the Polish underground organization, Front for the Rebirth of Poland, which was a continuation of the prewar Catholic Action. Its president at the time was the Polish writer, Zofia Kossak-Szczucka. Protest! was clandestinely issued as a leaflet in 5,000 copies in Warsaw on 11 August 1942. It was published a few weeks after the start of the Germans' liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto, from which ‚Äì as part of Operation Reinhard ‚Äì Jews were deported to the Treblinka extermination camp.Wro≈Ñski (1971)Engel (2014) The world, Kossak-Szczucka wrote, was silent in the face of this atrocity. \\"England is silent, so is America, even the influential international Jewry, so sensitive in its reaction to any transgression against its people, is silent. Poland is silent... Dying Jews are surrounded only by a host of Pilates washing their hands in innocence.\\" Those who are silent in the face of murder, she wrote, become accomplices to the crime. Kossak-Szczucka saw this largely as an issue of religious ethics. \\"Our feelings toward Jews have not changed,\\" she wrote. \\"We do not stop thinking of them as political, economic and ideological enemies of Poland.\\" But, she wrote, this does not relieve Polish Catholics of their duty to oppose the crimes being committed in their country. > We are required by God to protest,\\" she wrote. \\"God who forbids us to kill. > We are required by our Christian consciousness. Every human being has the > right to be loved by his fellow men. The blood of the defenceless cries to > heaven for revenge. Those who oppose our protest, are not Catholics. > We do not believe that Poland can benefit from German cruelties. On the > contrary. ... We know how poisoned is the fruit of the crime. ... Those who > do not understand this, and believe that a proud and free future for Poland > can be combined with acceptance of the grief of their fellow men, are > neither Catholics nor Poles. Reception The protest was a big surprise for leftist circles and the Jews themselves, because Zofia Kossak was associated with Catholic national circles, which in the pre-war Poland were very reserved for Jews and criticized Jewish communities. This position was also clearly presented by the author in the content of her protest. After announcing her appeal, Kossak repeatedly published in the underground press appeals to Poles for help to the Jews. Her efforts led in September 1942 to establishing an organization helping Jews, the Provisional Committee to Aid Jews (Tymczasowy Komitet Pomocy ≈ªydom), later transformed into the Council to Aid Jews (Rada Pomocy ≈ªydom) - ≈ªegota, an underground organization whose sole purpose was to save Jews in Poland from Nazi extermination. It was the only organization of this type in occupied Europe. Co-organizer was Wanda Krahelska, social activist of the Polish Socialist Party.Wro≈Ñski (1971)Engel (2014) Kossak personally helped the Jews hiding on the \\"Aryan side\\" by supplying them with money and false documents. In 1943 she was arrested by the Germans and imprisoned in the German concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau, and later transferred to Pawiak prison, where she was sentenced to death. It was saved in 1944 thanks to the efforts of the Polish underground. For her contribution to saving Jews during World War II, she received posthumously in 1982 a medal and the title of Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem. Regarding Kossak-Szczucka's \\"Protest\\", Robert D. Cherry and Annamaria Orla-Bukowska wrote in the introduction to Rethinking Poles and Jews: \\"Without at all whitewashing her antisemitism in the document, she vehemently called for active intercession on behalf of the Jews - precisely in the name of Polish Roman Catholicism and Polish patriotism. The deportations from the Warsaw Ghetto precipitated her cofounding of ≈ªegota that same year - an Armia Krajowa (AK, Home Army) unit whose sole purpose was to save Jews.\\" References Bibliography * * Category:1942 documents Category:1942 in Poland Category:Holocaust historiography Category:Holocaust historical documents Category:International response during the Holocaust Category:The Holocaust in Poland ","title":"Protest!"},{"id":"57790736","text":", nicknamed Nomoken, is a Japanese professional basketball player who plays for the Akita Northern Happinets of the B.League in Japan.

Staplers Jo trained by Nick Savva was voted Greyhound of the Year after winning the Anglo Irish International, Produce Stakes, Guineas and Ladbrokes Puppy Derby. Dew Reward trained by Michael O'Donovan was voted Irish Greyhound of the Year after winning the Irish Champion Stakes. John Coleman won the Greyhound Trainer of the Year. While William Hill remained part of the doomed Brent Walker, the new owners of Hackney Wick Stadium Fleetfoot Racing had announced an exciting redevelopment plan; before the end of the year the plans had turned into a fiasco. Work began on an ambitious project including a ¬£12 million restaurant and state of the art facilities, leading trainers were recruited and the stadium was rebranded 'The London Stadium'. Ex-Lloyds broker and racing journalist Robert Parker was replaced by Stephen Rea with the venture still requiring significant funds and beset with construction problems and internal disagreements the original ¬£14 million scheme to develop the neglected stadium had run into serious problems. Extra cash was raised by rights issues with companies including Rothschild, Henderson Venture Managers and Samuel Montagu. In October 1995 the new stadium was finally ready offering first-class facilities and significantly high prize money. However on the reopening night and despite a capacity crowd the stadium went into receivership during the same evening. Investigations began amidst rumours of fraud and Parker was pursued by Roger Cook on ITV's television program The Cook Report. Tracks Construction company Hawkins of Harrow went into administration following a lull in the building industry and repayments required to the banks for loans to purchase garden centres. They owned Northern Sports which meant that Oxford Stadium and Ramsgate Stadium were in the hands of the receivers. Ramsgate boss Sheila Yanez believes the track could be sold for ¬£1.2 million but that it would take at least a year to resolve planning issues with the neighbouring garden centre. Oxford General Manager John Blake and Northern Sports Group Racing Manager Mick Wheble were made redundant. Harlow Stadium opened on 15 March. Toni Nicholls bought the land from receivers when the new football stadium was being built in 1993 and constructed the new facilities including executive suites, a restaurant and conference and banqueting facilities. Sittingbourne opened on 3 October with new facilities including a track side restaurant, fast food outlets, three licensed bars and three private executive suites. Eddie Ramsay's SGRC (Scottish Greyhound Racing Company) was in financial difficulties and he sold Powderhall Stadium to a Channel Islands company called Charlotte Twenty-One (that included a shareholder called Walton Hankinson, a housing development specialist). News Treacys Triumph broke one of the oldest track records in Ireland after recording 31.68 at Harolds Cross for 580 yards. The half brother of Moral Standards improved Rail Ship's previous record set in 1973. Competitions Spring Rose trained by Charlie Lister finished second behind Elliots Gem in the inaugural Puppy Classic at Nottingham. Spring Rose, a white and fawn bitch would make a champion stayer. It was however Ballarue Minx trained by Bill Masters that was the stand out stayer of the year; the white and brindle bitch won the first Cesarewitch to be held at Catford Stadium, which added to her St Leger crown from the previous year.

The application uses proprietary software to help parents monitor their children‚Äôs text messages, browser history, social media activity, stored videos or photos, emails, and phone GPS location.  History  KidGuard was developed by a Los Angeles-based team and officially released in 2016. After KidGuard's launch, the application received coverage on ABC News and Inc. Magazine. In 2017, KidGuard partnered with the startup incubator OnRamp Lab, located in Taipei, Taiwan. The same year, international security consultant Gene Yu joined the KidGuard advisory board to aid with kidnapping response and prevention measures.  Features  Following the software as a service model, KidGuard is run through a web application that allows a parent to view all activity on a child's phone, including: * Reading sent and received text messages, including deleted messages and texts sent via popular alternative messaging applications such as WhatsApp. * Accessing browser history, call history and application usage, including duration and frequency. * Viewing all photos and videos saved to a child's phone, * Using a smartphone's GPS to track location, as well as setting geo-fencing to alert parents. KidGuard also includes a feature it calls a \\"Situation 360 Report,\\" in which the application automatically creates a report to aid law enforcement in the event of a child's disappearance. The report includes a full profile of a child's recent locations, behavior and message history.  Controversy  Critics have raised concerns about the potential capability of KidGuard and its competitors to violate privacy laws or to be used as a tool by stalkers and abusers. In May 2018, KidGuard was featured in a New York Times article which criticized the application's developers for running advertisements aimed at adults attempting to spy on their spouses or discover infidelity. After KidGuard was contacted for comment, a spokesman responded that these advertisements had been developed by a marketing partner. All content relating to infidelity was subsequently removed from the KidGuard website.  Philanthropy  KidGuard maintains an annual \\"KidGuard for Education Essay Scholarship\\" for high school students in the United States. The scholarship is awarded to an undisclosed number of participants, based on the results of an essay content whose topics concern online safety and cyberbullying. In 2017, KidGuard donated $25,000 in grants to 18 non-profit organizations focused on child safety and online threat prevention. The largest grant of $5,000 was awarded to the Megan Meier Foundation.

They live with Messi in a two-storey house on a large plot of land in Penza, Russia. In 2017, the Dmitrievs started an Instagram account and a YouTube channel for Messi, which became very popular by 2018 and continues to grow in subscribers. Messi also shared the property and attention of the Dmitrievs with a 10-year-old female cheetah named Itchel, who was given to the Dmitrievs by a circus trainer in December 2019 and revealed in January 2020. Itchel the cheetah died in April 2020 due to lung cancer. Early life Messi was born in a zoo at Saransk, Russia. He was one of three newborn cougars at the zoo to be named after professional football players for FC Barcelona; Messi was named after Lionel Messi, and the other two were named Suarez and Neymar. The cubs were given these names because Saransk was one of several cities proposed to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Messi was later sold to a petting zoo in Penza when he was three months old. Messi was significantly smaller than other typical male cougars, and as the species is not native to Russia, he could not be released into the wild. He had numerous other health problems as well, which deemed him unable to live in a zoo or wildlife sanctuary either. Furthermore, workers at the petting zoo originally planned to euthanize him. In 2016, Alexandr and Mariya Dmitriev visited the Penza zoo and met Messi for the first time. The couple experienced \\"love at first sight,\\" and noticed Messi's exceptionally gentle personality. The Dmitrievs considered purchasing Messi as a pet, and made the final decision to purchase Messi from the petting zoo. Domestic life When they first purchased Messi, Alexandr and Mariya Dmitriev lived in a small studio apartment in Penza. The hallway of the apartment was modified and was designated as Messi's play area. Messi uses toys such as empty bottles and balls. Messi lives in a two-storey house on property along with Kira(a sphinx cat) and Itchl (the cheetah). Messi has a gentle and calm personality, and has never attacked a person. The Dmitrievs sometimes refer to him as \\"kitten.\\" Messi is regarded by his owners as similar to a domestic dog. He has been trained at a local dog training facility and has learned around ten formal commands. The Dmitrievs walk Messi regularly using a leash, coat, and harness through various environments. Messi is fed twice a day, and his diet mostly consists of raw turkey, beef, and chicken. It costs the Dmitrievs about 630 rubles per day to feed him. The couple regularly bathes Messi in a bathtub and sometimes trim his nails. Messi is house-broken (trained) and prefers to stay inside when there is snow outside. Media attention In 2017, the Dmitrievs started an Instagram account and YouTube channel for Messi, both called \\"I_am_puma\\". Pictures and videos published to these social media accounts show various aspects of daily life with the cougar. Messi's social media accounts quickly grew in popularity; by January 2018, the Instagram account already had almost 150,000 followers and over 50 million views. The Instagram account currently has over 1,400,000 followers, and the YouTube channel has over 1,000,000 subscribers. Mariya is the manager of the social media accounts. Criticism Despite mostly favorable attention on social media, some have criticized the Dmitrievs for keeping Messi under domestic circumstances. Opposers of the domestication of wild animals fear that Messi's wild needs will not be met, and that once Messi reaches sexual maturity he may become more prone to dangerous behavior. They advise the Dmitrievs to send Messi to a wildlife reserve or sanctuary. The Dmitrievs, however, believe that Messi would not be able to survive in a wild setting. Messi has been neutered for his own health which removes some criticism.

He achieved fame as a pianist, especially in Austria during the Twenties and Thirties in a piano duo with his brother Heinz Scholz with whom he also published the first authoritative collection of Mozart‚Äôs works for piano. After emigrating to the United States in 1938 he became a well-known conductor and founder of the American Chamber Orchestra in New York. In 1963 the US State Department invited him to teach in Taiwan as part of a scholarly exchange program. Here he achieved lasting fame as a conductor and especially as the founding father of Taiwan's piano tradition. Most influential piano professors in Taiwan today can trace their roots back to his teachings. He died in Taipei in 1986. Life Genealogy Robert Scholz was born in Steyr, Austria, on 16 October 1902. His father, Karl Scholz, was a store manager, his mother, Johanna Mayr, a soprano who met and corresponded with Anton Bruckner.(\\"\\"). Linz: Anton Bruckner Chronologie Datenbank, 4.9.1889 . His elder brother, the pianist Heinz Scholz (1897-1988), was president of the Mozarteum Salzburg in 1964. Some genealogical research of the Scholz family from 1750 until the present time has been undertaken by the composer Martin Fiala in Steyr.(\\"\\"). Lu, Nancy T. \\"Scholz's Birthplace in Austria Revisited\\". In \\"The China Post\\". Taipei, July 16, 2001. Early Years in Austria Scholz received his first piano lessons from his mother in 1906 but failed to find a more professional piano teacher in Steyr during the war years. Together with his brother Heinz he participated in charity concerts to raise funds for the Red Cross and to help the wounded.\\"Robert Scholz. Weltb√ºrger der Musik. Ein √ñsterreicher - in Taiwan verliebt.\\" Ed. Liu, Lung-Kai and Hui-Chung Chang. Taipei: Robert Scholz Musikstiftung, 2001, p. 143. He graduated from highschool (\\"Realschule\\") in 1920. In 1921 he took about ten piano lessons with Austrian pianist Friedrich W√ºhrer in Vienna, each time traveling 16 hours from Steyr,See: Robert Scholz. Weltb√ºrger, p. 143 and was later admitted to the Mozarteum in Salzburg where he studied with Felix Petyrek. After only ten lessons Scholz returned to Steyr studying without a teacher. Just nine months after he entered it, Scholz passed the Mozarteum's final exams in piano and composition with distinction (\\"mit Auszeichnung\\") and also received a teaching certificate.See: Robert Scholz. Weltb√ºrger, p. 144 Subsequently he taught piano and composition at the Mozarteum from 1924-1937.See: Robert Scholz. Weltb√ºrger, p. 144 In 1935 he even became the first teacher for harpsichord at an Austrian music college.See: Robert Scholz. Weltb√ºrger, p. 146 Robert and Heinz Scholz had a distinguished career as a piano duo which began with a European tour in 1923. They performed concertos for two pianos by Mozart, Robert Scholz himself and others with world famous conductors such as Clemens Krauss, Dimitri Mitropoulos in Athens, Herbert von Karajan in Aachen, Bruno Walter and Arturo Toscanini at the Salzburg Festival.See: Robert Scholz. Weltb√ºrger, pp. 144-147 During their tours till 1938, including tours in the US and Canada, they often performed a two-piano arrangement of Bach's The Art of Fugue by Erich Schwebsch. In 1937, the year when Robert Scholz received an Honorary professorship, he gave a recital on Mozart's original piano at Salzburg Residenz, a concert which was attended by Walter and Toscanini.See: Robert Scholz. Weltb√ºrger, pp. 146-147 In 1927 the Viennese Universal Edition commissioned the Scholz brothers to edit Mozart's piano works based on his manuscripts. America In 1938 Robert Scholz emigrated to the US settling in New York where he began to teach at the David Mannes Music School. During the same time he started teaching the eight-year old Martin Canin, who was to become a famous piano teacher and performer. The idea of Scholz was to bring Salzburg's music tradition to New York. Collaborating with violinists Ivan Galamian and Louis Persinger as well as pianist Isabelle Vengerova he founded a Mozart orchestra and later a chorus at the Music School of the Henry Street Settlement, a project that was intended to foster talented children from underprivileged backgrounds. Between 1945 and 1950 this orchestra and chorus performed annual concerts at New York Town Hall. Scholz, who took conducting lessons with George Szell in 1940 and taught in summer-camps together with Ivan Galamian, also collaborated with Bruno Walter and his orchestra.See: Robert Scholz. Weltb√ºrger, pp. 147-149 Robert Scholz composed large-scale works during this period and arranged Bach's The Art of Fugue for orchestra. Having performed Bruckner's Fourth Symphony and Te Deum with the Mozart orchestra and chorus of the Henry Street Settlement he was presented with the Bruckner Medal of Honor on 12 March 1950 by the Bruckner Society of America. In 1953 Robert Scholz founded the professional American Chamber Orchestra with which he regularly appeared at New York Town Hall and toured the US and Canada. In 1956 he recorded various works by Mozart with this orchestra for Westminster Records, among others the Haffner Serenade and also recorded Mozart piano concertos with Dame Myra Hess.See: Robert Scholz. Weltb√ºrger, pp. 149-150 Late Years in Taiwan In 1963, through the recommendation of the US State Department and the Fulbright Program, Robert Scholz was invited to Taiwan where he would live until his death in 1986. He accepted a professorship for piano and chorus at Taiwan Provincial Teachers‚Äô College (now National Taiwan Normal University). He also taught at the National Academy of Arts (now National Taiwan University of Arts) and later at the College of Chinese Culture (\\"Hwa Kang\\", now Chinese Culture University). Besides piano, which he also taught privately, Scholz taught conducting, chorus conducting, composition, theory and vocal accompaniment. Seminaries were arranged by the United States Information Service. Taiwanese composer Hsu Tsang-Houei (Ë®±Â∏∏ÊÉ†) has called Robert Scholz a \\"missionary of music\\" and compared him to the French Jesuit missionary Amiot in Qing China.See: Hsu Chang-huei. \\"Robert Scholz und der Musikkreis in Taiwan\\". In \\"Robert Scholz. Weltb√ºrger\\", p. 32 Unlike in New York Scholz did not found an orchestra in Taiwan, but served as a principal and guest conductor of all leading local orchestras, especially the Taiwan Provincial Symphony Orchestra (now National Taiwan Symphony Orchestra), the Ministry of Defense Symphony Orchestra, but also school orchestras, building a foundation for their rehearsal methods, repertoire expansion, etc. Hsu Tsang-Houei wrote that Scholz \\"laid the foundation stone of orchestra culture in Taiwan\\".See: Robert Scholz. Weltb√ºrger, p. 33 During his time in Taiwan he conducted numerous concerts and gala concerts collaborating with most leading local performers, such as pianists Francis Wu, Azusa Fujita and Liu Fu-Mei.See: Robert Scholz. Weltb√ºrger, pp. 150-160 In 1969 Robert Scholz married Emane Wu (Âê≥Êº™Êõº, Wu Yi-Man, 1931-2019), a well-known pianist and professor in Taiwan. Her father, Wu Bochao (Âê≥‰ºØË∂Ö), was a famous Chinese composer who perished in the Taiping Steamer's voyage to Taiwan, 1949, while fleeing advancing Chinese Communist forces during the Chinese Civil War. Scholz later conducted his works. In 1970 Robert Scholz conducted the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra and accepted a professorship at Musashino Academy of Music whose orchestra and chorus he led as well. He returned to Taiwan in 1971. In 1973 he also appeared as a guest conductor in Seoul.See: Robert Scholz. Weltb√ºrger, pp. 155-160 During the last years of his life Robert Scholz became interested in philosophical studies. His writings were compiled by Bernhard Fuehrer and Bernhard Pohl and posthumously published by the Robert Scholz Music Foundation as \\"Posthumous Works of Robert Scholz\\", in 8 volumes, 1993. On October 11, 1986, Robert Scholz died at the National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei.See: Robert Scholz. Weltb√ºrger, p. 160 Teaching Robert Scholz and his wife with a group of his piano students about to leave for Austria in 1971 As a piano teacher Robert Scholz emphasized controlled breathing and watched the harmonious movement of the student's arm and body. He also insisted on notating phrasing, pedal marks and fingering in the score before the student learned the piece.See: Liu Fu-Mei. \\"Zum Gedenken an den Lehrmeister\\". In \\"Robert Scholz. Weltb√ºrger\\", pp. 39-43 Many students of Professor Scholz left Taiwan on a program organized by Taiwan's Ministry of Education as \\"gifted children\\" (\\"Ë≥áË≥¶ÂÑ™Áï∞Â§©ÊâçÂÖíÁ´•\\") before their sixteenth birthday to study in Austria or other countries and many of them are pianists today or leading professors in Taiwan and abroad, among others Tai-Cheng Chen, Se-Se Chang, Lucy Revers, Judy Chin, Han-An Liu, Lina Yeh, Lee-Hwei Wang. Conductors who studied with Professor Scholz include Felix Chen and Dau-Hsiong Tseng and composers Tyzen Hsiao. Works Most important compositions and writings of Robert Scholz were published by the Robert Scholz Music Foundation and the R.O.C. National Committee of the Asian Composers League. His personal book collection and annotated musical scores were donated to the National Central Library by Emane Wu. These include personally annotated musical scores dating back to 1938, a 10-volume set of selected works, manuscripts on the thought of Prof. Scholz, musical recordings, and materials on the professor‚Äôs musical theory, biography, literature and lyrics.

Early life  Anthony Buttigieg was born in Malta in 1962. He spent his childhood in England. He graduated in medicine from the University of Malta in 1987. He spent several years working at St. Luke's Hospital in the emergency department before moving to St. James Hospital where he worked as a senior medical officer. In 1999 Buttigieg led a medical mission to Albania during the Kosovo War. He is a founding member of the Democratic Party becoming a deputy leader upon its formation, and later a leader up till now.  Hobbies  In his free time, Buttigieg enjoys painting and reading ‚Äì a hobby which accrued him a library of some 2000 books. He also loves nature and growing vegetables in his own home garden patch.  Political career  As deputy leader of Partit Demokratiku, Dr. Buttigieg made clear he was against the \\"us vs them\\" mentality of Maltese tribal politics. Anthony Buttigieg was appointed leader of the Democratic Party on 1 November 2017. He stated that fighting corruption would be a main priority, along with fighting for the environment. Upon assuming the leadership, he explained in an interview that he wanted the Democratic Party to be a band of concerned citizens, and for Maltese politics to move beyond partisan cults of personality. He led a delegation of the Democratic Party to Amsterdam, to participate in the congress of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party. The Democratic Party then acceded to ALDE. Dr. Buttigieg spoke out against the government's economic model, making the rich richer and failing to distribute wealth beyond cronyism. He wrote to the EU Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager, to investigate ENEMED's 'fuel supply monopoly'. Along with deputy leader Timothy Alden he met with representatives of Maltese NGOs, including Din l-Art ƒ¶elwa and Flimkien gƒßal Ambjent Aƒßjar to pledge support to the Wirtna declaration. When the rule of law delegation came to visit Malta, he led a Democratic Party delegation to meet them. In the meeting, the Party said that clientelism in Malta was a major problem, and the Vitals Global Healthcare deal was discussed. He has also argued for a more inclusive national identity. Deciding to prioritise the upcoming European Parliament election, 2019, while balancing his other personal responsibilities, and believing it to be in the interests of the Democratic Party, Dr. Buttigieg announced that he would be stepping down from the leadership.

The drop in tote turnover could be partly attributed to the first full year of the National Lottery which had begun the previous November. Spring Rose trained by Charlie Lister was voted Greyhound of the Year after winning the Grand Prix at Walthamstow Stadium and the St Leger at Wembley. She broke the Walthamstow track record twice on her way to winning the Grand Prix and made the St Leger final unbeaten before clocking 39.29 in the final, a new track record. Linda Mullins became the first woman to win the Greyhound Trainer of the Year. Tracks There was no news on the London Stadium (Hackney) which was in administration, the situation looked unsettled despite good reviews about the stadium. It also hosted the Trainers Championship won by Ernie Gaskin Sr.. Ramsgate Stadium was closed by the receivers but sister track Oxford Stadium was bought by Isle of Man businessman Don Joyce who brought in a new General Manager Dan McCormack. Sittingbourne closed following financial problems but was re-opened by Roger Cearns, the grandson of WJ Cearns the founder of Wimbledon Stadium. The National Lottery was cited as one of the main reasons why Raikes Park Greyhound Stadium in Bolton closed. The site on by the Raikes colliery on the Manchester Road had been one of the most prestigious Independent tracks and hosted the Independent Derby, St Leger and Guineas. It was a major loss within the independent circles and the independents had a bad year because Bury St Edmunds also closed. News Former Slough and Wembley trainer Ted Dickson died leaving daughter Hazel to run the kennels on her own. When Ramsgate closed trainer Peter Rich moved to Catford and then Romford in quick succession. Hove trainer Bill Masters retired leaving Alan (Claude) Gardiner to take over the kennel. Gardiner was previously assistant to Brian Clemenson. Romford installed former Bolton Racing Manager Peter O'Dowd as the new Racing Manager to replace Steve Daniel who had only recently replaced Ray Spalding. The Bord na gCon sold the site of the Cork Greyhound Stadium in Cork and purchased a green-field site in Curraheen on the western fringes of the city with the intention of building a brand new facility there. The Intertrack betting service was introduced for the first time enabling racegoers at other tracks around the country to view the racing and place bets direct into the Wimbledon tote.

An otherwise unremarkable specimen of the London plane, it has become known for having partially consumed a nearby park bench. It has become a tourist attraction and is frequently photographed. The Hungry Tree was the subject of a campaign by Green Party politician Ciar√°n Cuffe to ensure its preservation.  Description  Hungry Tree in 2018 The tree lies just inside the south gate of the grounds of the King's Inns (the Irish inn of court) on Constitution Hill in Dublin. It is a London Plane (Platanus x hispanica) of the type widely planted in Dublin in the 19th century. It has been estimated to be between 80 and 120 years old. The tree, described as an unremarkable specimen \\"mediocre in appearance\\", is in height and in girth. The tree was planted adjacent to a cast iron bench dating from the early 1800s. Over decades the tree has grown to encompass the bench. The tree is said to be \\"eating\\" the bench, which is how its name originated. The grounds of King's Inns are open to the public between 7 a.m. and 7.30 p.m. every day and the tree has become something of a tourist attraction. It is much photographed and has appeared on the cover of the tourist guidebook Secret Dublin ‚Äì an unusual guide and in artist Robert Ballagh's 1981 book Dublin.  Preservation campaign  The tree has been listed as one of the country's \\"Heritage Trees\\" by the Tree Council of Ireland. It has been listed largely for its value as a curiosity and tourist attraction rather than its age or rarity. Green Party councillor Ciar√°n Cuffe campaigned in 2017 for the Dublin Central Area Committee to grant the tree a tree preservation order (TPO). Cuffe stated that the Hungry Tree and neighbouring trees \\"are a lovely part of the history of the north inner city. A bit like the Blessington Street Basin, it is a hidden gem. I love it and I‚Äôd hate to lose it... They have witnessed history and they are all the more precious for their age.\\" The application for the TPO was refused as it was considered that the tree lay within the curtilage of other structures and by extension benefited from the protections already granted to these buildings. Consideration was given to listing the bench as a protected structure but was decided against as there could then have been a requirement imposed on the council to destroy the tree to protect the bench.

Hot Dog is a 1930 animated short film which is presented by Max Fleischer and was also directed by Dave Fleischer. The film, which was originally released by Paramount Pictures, is the first cartoon to feature Bimbo, as he attempts to gain a lover during the film. The title is meant to show Bimbo's delight when he finds another girl, as 'Hot Dog' is North American exclamation slang for \\"An expression of delight\\". Copyrighted on 29 March 1930, and released the same day, the film is part of the Talkartoons cartoon series, which was released by Paramount Pictures. Plot Bimbo playing \\"St. Louis Blues\\" on his banjo. The film begins with Bimbo in his car. He then stops at a line of three girls, and in an attempt to charm them, tips his hat to them. This does not work on two of them, who both reject him. However, when the third one accepts and turns around, Bimbo comically realises that the third \\"girl\\" is a male lion. So, the car comically digs a hole in the road in order to escape him. Bimbo tips his hat to him as he leaves. The police officer notices this and start to pursue Bimbo. Whilst the police officer is doing that, Bimbo is attempting to charm another girl, by whistling at her and putting his arm around her. This ends in the flowers on the girl's hat comically turning into a fist and then striking Bimbo in the head. Bimbo then tries to kiss the girl, whilst calling her \\"his sweetheart\\". This ends with the girl's shoes turning into roller skates and she skates away from Bimbo. When he is trying to catch her, the police officer spots him, and tries to get him. Bimbo tries to walk away, but ends up in a police march. The band play \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\" whilst going to the station. Bimbo then ends up in court. The judge asks him to explain his presence. Bimbo, then brings out his banjo, and starts to play \\"St. Louis Blues\\". The entire court starts to dance to the song, with the Liberty painting on the wall comically dancing as well. He then starts to sing. His testimony is recording as squatting, due to its presences in the song that he is singing. He then gets on the judge's desk and continues to scat and then he comically uses the judge's beard as a banjo, which angers the judge. He then bounces on his banjo and tips his hat to the entire court. The film ends with Bimbo comically leaving the court house riding his banjo like a unicycle. Characters In this film, there is a plethora of characters. One of them is Bimbo, who is the main character in the film. Bimbo tries multiple times to gain a lover, however he fails at doing so and ends up in court. There are also the police officers, who attempt to pursue him throughout the film. There are also the women, who Bimbo attempts to charm them throughout the film. The film features both humans and animals, as the court room is entire consisted all humans, whilst the streets are all animal.  Reception  Hot Dog was well received by the cinema magazine Variety. The magazine said that the film was \\"Quite a laugh\\", and also said that the film possesses a \\"real hot quality\\".

Some Picture trained by Charlie Lister was voted Greyhound of the Year after winning the 1997 English Greyhound Derby and the 1997 Scottish Greyhound Derby in addition to reaching the 1997 Irish Greyhound Derby final. The black dog was also voted the leading dog in Ireland and won the Irish Dog of the Year and only just missed out on a ¬£100,000 bonus prize offered by sponsors Regal to any greyhound winning the Scottish, English and Irish Derby. Linda Mullins won the Greyhound Trainer of the Year for the second successive year. Tracks The year started badly when on 4 January the London Stadium closed its doors. The stadium had been rebuilt had huge cost and was now subject to rumours of fraud and malpractice. The reasons for administration was subject to investigation and even appeared on 'The Cook Report', a popular TV show hosted by Roger Cook who chased the former Hackney MD Robert Parker down the street as he attempted to evade the TV cameras. On 27 October Eastville Stadium owned by the BS Group was sold for development, plans were announced for a new Bristol greyhound stadium that never came to fruition. The BS Group management switched the entire operation, including trainers, racing office staff and bookmakers forty miles up the M4 to the newly acquired Swindon, bought from British Car Auctions who had owned the track since 1983, even the Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service (BAGS) contract switched to Swindon. Bristol trainers Terry Kibble, Ron Dix, Marjorie Millard and Peter Swadden all moved Swindon. The racing ended at Dunmore Stadium in March 1997 and the last meeting attracted 3,000 patrons. News Catford Racing Manager Jim Snowden left to be General Manager at Portsmouth replacing the retiring Bill Francis. Snowden was replaced by the Assistant Racing Manager Phil Donaldson. In Wimbledon the Merton council produced a feasibility study into putting a football stadium on Wimbledon Stadium which was dismissed by Wimbledon chairman Sam Hammam. A first season trainer called Seamus Cahill joined Catford. Competitions The BBC severed their ties with greyhound racing as they continued to cut their sporting programs. Sky stepped in and would show the TV Trophy for the first time which led to the bizarre scenario whereby the event was held twice; once in April (BBC) and then again in October (Sky). The relationship with Sky was closely guarded by the Greyhound Racing Association who gained the upper hand in negotiations for the industry. Derby semi-finalist Toms The Best hit a great run of form in the summer winning the Midland Gold Cup at Monmore and the Sussex Cup at Hove before heading for the Irish Derby and claiming the competition for Nick Savva. Spring Rose continued to perform well, reaching the Grand Prix final at Walthamstow and St Leger final at Wembley but she was upstaged by Tralee Crazy.

It is due to mutations in the ADA2 gene which encodes the adenosine deaminase 2 protein. The clinical features of this condition are protean and it may be easily missed. Signs and symptoms The age of onset of symptoms is variable: 24% of reported patients present before 1 year of age. 77% present before the age 10 years. Adult onset has also been described. 5-10% die from this disease by the age of 30 years. Like all vasculitis syndromes the features depend on which is organ is involved. Most commonly the gut, kidney and liver are affected.

Due to his bravery, he received several promotions. In 87 B.C., as Emperor Wu was nearing death, Shangguan was made one of 4 officials assisting Wu's successor, the young Liu Fuling (who would ascend the throne as Emperor Zhao; the other 3 are Huo Guang, Jin Midi, and Sang Hongyang). Shangguan Jie's son Shangguan An married a daughter of Huo Guang; Shangguan An's daughter would later become Emperor Zhao's empress. However, the cordial relationship between Shangguan Jie and Huo Guang would not last, presumably due to Shangguan's jealousy of Huo's power being greater than his own. In 80 B.C., the Shangguan clan, along with Sang Hongyang, was implicated in an attempted rebellion, and exterminated. Due to his crime of treason, his biography was not included in the Book of Han; details on him were instead found in the biographies of his granddaughter and Li Guangli.

Lauren Ikenn of This Song Slaps wrote that the song was \\"bound to be a hit\\", further stating that the song \\"is the ultimate house track, complete with a hard-hitting beat, a catchy drop and AU8UST's pop-infused vocals.\\" Billboard''s David Rishty wrote that the two producers had \\"flipped the script and dropped a bouncy house cut\\", describing the song as \\"buoyant\\" and \\"sprinkled with high-pitched vocal chops.\\" Marcus of EDM Sauce described the songs drop as anime-like, further writing that \\"these dudes have us completely fooled.

Her greatest hit was the song \\"O Amor e o Poder\\", part of the telenovela Mandala soundtrack (1987).  Early life  Rosanah was born in S√£o Paulo neighborhood of Br√°s, from Aldo Fiengo and Zenaide Romano Fiengo. She began to sing professionally when she was 13 on her father's band Casanova's. In 1969, Rosanah was vocalist for the band Cry Babies alongside musicians like Luiz Carlos Batera, one of the founders of Banda Black Rio. In 1972, Tim Maia recorded her composition \\"J√° era tempo de Voc√™\\" In 1980 she participated in music festivals in television. in 1981 she was qualified in Rede Globo's MPB Shell Festival with the song \\"Pensei Que Fosse F√°cil, mas n√£o √â\\", composed by Z√© Rodrix. In 1985, she participated in the Festival dos Festivais, and sang the song \\"Vidra√ßa\\" in one of the qualifiers. Also in that year, Rosanah participated in the children's TV show A Era dos Halley by Augusto C√©sar Vannucci, singing alongside Guilherme Lamounier the song \\"Luz de Mim\\" by Daltony Nobrega. In 1986, after recording some records and participating in others Rosanah sent a tape to TV Globo with a song - \\"Nem um toque\\", that ended up featured in the soundtrack of the telenovela Roda de Fogo (1986). With this exposure, the music was extensively performed on radios. Rosana then signed a contract with CBS / Sony Music that year, remaining on this label until 1993 when she migrated to Polygram. Her greatest success, however, occurred in 1987, with the song \\"O Amor e o Poder,\\" part of the soundtrack for telenovela Mandala. A version of Jennifer Rush's song \\"The Power of Love\\", the track stayed in first place for several consecutive weeks in the charts.

As a result of an injunction granted to Rosanah, access to her article in Portuguese Wikipedia was publicly unavailable for almost two years. In 2012, the singer had already considered prosecuting Google before because search results indicated pages that gave her an age she claimed wrong. During Rosanah's public career, several divergent claims were published about her date of birth. In 1987, Veja magazine stated that the singer was 25 years old (born 1961 or 1962).https://acervo.veja.abril.com.br/index.html#/edition/1003?page=146&section;=1&word;=1003 In 1999, Isto√© Gente magazine stated that Rosanah was 36 years old (born 1962 or 1963). According to the artist's record in the Cravo Albin Dictionary of Brazilian Popular Music, she would have been born in 1963. In 2008, Globo.com published a video clip of the singer that supposedly would have been aired on Fant√°stico in 1978. The recording features Rosanah at the end of puberty. In 2010, EGO magazine reported that singer was 56 years old and in the same year, the magazine published \\"Spending sensuality at the age of 42- an age that she made a point of correcting after misunderstanding with a search site that had published 56\\". In 2012, Fienngo stated in an interview that she was 44 years old and that she was born in 1968. In the same year, a discrepancy was verified on the singer's date of birth, since most documents submitted to the Supreme Electoral Court (TSE) for her candidacy for Rio de Janeiro councilor in the 2012 elections say that Rosanah was born in 1954, but her Cadastro de Pessoa F√≠sica (CPF) states the year 1968. In 2016, Rosanah asked the TSE to rectify her date of birth on the website DivulgaCand. On September 14, 2016, the article on the singer on Wikipedia was restored after a decision favorable to Wikimedia. On October 6 of the same year, her lawyers appealed the decision.http://www4.tjrj.jus.br/consultaProcessoWebV2/consultaProc.do?v=2&numProcesso;=2013.203.036204-7&FLAGNOME;=S&tipoConsulta;=publica&back;=1&PORTAL;=1&v;=2 However, in July 2017, Rosanah lost the case that moved, because the Court of Rio de Janeiro understood that neither Google nor Wikipedia were responsible for the information. In the decision, Judge M√°rcia Cunha of the 21st Civil Chamber stated that the artist's age had been taken from the TSE database, since she was a candidate for Rio de Janeiro councilor.

It was built in 1923 and operated as a theatre until 1926. It is not be confused with a completely unrelated theatre, also called Th√©√¢tre de l'√âtoile, which operated from 1928 to 1964 on the Avenue Wagram. History The theatre was built on the initiative of the playwright, director, and theatre manager who at the time was also the manager of the Th√©√¢tre √âdouard VII. The new theatre, decorated in a colour scheme of red and gold, was situated on the first floor of a building on the corner of Avenue des Champs-√âlys√©es and Rue Balzac. The building's penthouse was occupied by the flamboyant art collector and interior designer Carlos de Beistegui. Under Franck's direction the theatre staged Sacha Guitry's comedy L'Accroche-c≈ìur in 1923 and Revue de Printemps in 1924, both starring Guitry and his then-wife Yvonne Printemps. Both were very successful, but subsequent productions of the operettas Amants l√©gitimes and Pouche (with a libretto by Franck) were commercial failures. In 1925 Franck sold the √âtoile to Camille Choisy, the manager of the Th√©√¢tre du Grand- Guignol, and Jacques Jouvin, one of the directors there. At the √âtoile, they premiered Ren√© Mercier's operetta Le P√™ch√© capiteux starring Arletty in September 1925 and in November staged Josephine Baker's show La Revue N√®gre after its initial run at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es. The theatre closed definitively in early 1926 after which it became a dance and cabaret hall operating under a variety of names in the ensuing years: \\"L'Embassy\\", \\"Le panache\\", and \\"La joie dans la cave\\". It was eventually demolished and replaced by offices and shops.

It was not a regular knightly order, its membership did not result in any special privileges or duties. The knightly title was not hereditary, it was given only for a personal use. However, the knights were authorized, to wear real golden spurs, attached to their boots at the ceremony, and they also wore a small golden spur on their hats. Insignia They did not have any regular insignia, though it had been claimed several times. On 21 April 1918 Charles IV of Hungary created a decorative medal for them as a memorial insignia to his 30 December 1916 coronation in Budapest.Georg Ludwigsdorff in das unter Verantwortung von Johann Stolzer en Christian Steeb erschienene: √ñsterreichs Orden vom Mittelalter bis zur Gegenwart Blz. 197 ‚Äì 202, Akademische Druck- und Verlagsanstalt Graz, The preparations for the design begun in 1917, by Joseph Hoffmann, a professor from Vienna.

The minutes of the 35th session of the Council of Ministers of 26 October 1917 inform us, that badges have already been completed.P√°l Gergely Sallay ‚Äì J√°nos Szentv√°ry-Luk√°cs p. 49. The statute of Charles IV about the decorative medal of knights of the golden spur was finally issued on 21 April 1918. Accordingly, the decorative medal had to be worn in the neck, on the ribbon of the Order of Saint Stephen. The hand written royal decree of 10 April 1918 allows that the decorative medal may be retained, and passed over to the heirs of the bearer as a gift. Later on, the Hungarian Prime Minister S√°ndor Wekerle was authorized to handled the affairs of the knights. From the 12‚Äì13 December 1917 correspondence of Count Otokar Czernin, Minister in the personal service of the ruler, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Count Alad√°r Zichy, the Minister in the personal service of the King, we know the decision, how the bearers of the decorative medal have to wear the badge: \\"... it seems reasonable to determine precisely, that this emblem can only be worn in its original size, in the neck, and any other ways, like wearing it on the bosom or in the form of a knob made of ribbons, should be avoided under all circumstances.\\" The ministerial summary also emphasizes that, despite its ornate design, the badge hasn't been regarded as a badge of an order, but rather as a wearable memorial item.Gergely P√°l Sallay ‚Äì J√°nos Szentv√°ry-Luk√°cs 50. The medal from the front side shows a white enameled double cross, with the letter K (K√°roly) in the middle. Above the cross was placed the Holy Crown of Hungary, and the cross is surrounded by a green enameled dragon, symbolizing the Order of the Dragon. The dragon and the cross are by three quarters surrounded by an ornate golden spur. The height of the memorial sign is 67 mm, the width is 44 mm. It was worn on the red ribbon (wide 40‚Äì50 mm or more), lined by green (the ribbon of Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary). On the back side of the medal, only the dragon was worked up in detail.Die Orden des K√∂nigsreichs Ungarn, ein Fachreferat von Dr. Ottfried Neubecker, abgedruckt in der Zeitschrift Uniform Makt, Jahrgang 1943, Heft 3 At that time, gold and silver honors began to be replaced by bronze and zinc, and only the highest orders were made from precious metals. The Bachruch company in Budapest has been entrusted with the production of the decorative medals. Despite the approval of April 1918 and the finished production of the badges by the end of 1917, the distribution still has not been made. According to a letter of 23 October 1918, the Bachruch company indicated that because of the blockade on silkware they can not deliver the badges. On 13 November 1918 they sent another negative answer regarding the acquisition of ribbons, although the badge was the same as the neck-ribbon of the middle cross of the long existing Royal Hungarian Order of Saint Stephen. All this perfectly reflects the extent of the lack of raw materials (and the negative effects of accumulation of goods) at the end of the World War. Finally, the knights got their badges only since February 1920.Gergely P√°l Sallay ‚Äì J√°nos Szentv√°ry- Luk√°cs pp. 51‚Äì52. (Meantime the main events were the end of the world war, the end of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the rise and end of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, the Treaty of Trianon, and the beginning of the new Kingdom of Hungary.) The history of the order The legend of the knights of the golden spur dates back to the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in Rome, which took place on October 28, 312 (some older chroniclers stated the year incorrectly as 265), when Constantine I (306‚Äì337), co-ruler of the Roman Empire (with territorial power in the provinces of Gallia, Britannia and Germania) defeated Maxentius (306‚Äì312), another co-ruler (with territorial power in Italia and the African provinces), who fell from the bridge to the Tiber during the battle and drowned. Subsequently, Constantine became Augustus (emperor) of the Western Roman Empire, and later on declared Christianity as official state religion. According to the chronicles of Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 265-1339) and Lactantius (c. 250‚Äì325), Constantine and his soldiers had a vision the night before the battle, sent by the Christian God. This was interpreted as a promise of victory if the heavenly sign of the Chi-Rho, the first two letters of Christ's name in Greek, was painted on the soldiers' shields, to fight under the protection of the Christian God. (According to Eusebius, Constantine with his army was marching to Rome, when he looked up to the sun and saw a cross of light above it, and with it the Greek words \\"ŒïŒΩ Œ§ŒøœçœÑ·ø≥ ŒùŒØŒ∫Œ±\\", usually translated into Latin as \\"in hoc signo vinces\\", that is, \\"Through this sign [you shall] conquer\\".) The medieval chroniclers believed, that the knights of the golden spur can be originated from the \\"Militia Aurata\\" (golden knighthood), created by Emperor Constantine, who fought with him in the battle. At the time of the pontificate of Pope Sylvester I (314‚Äì335) the city of Rome started to be converted to Christianity. The pope was great patron of Militia Aurata, who also assisted to secure his power. The late Middle Ages and New Age historians placed knights of the golden spur at the top of the chivalric virtues (and anachronistically they also originated the papal Order of the Golden Spur from pope Sylvester I). As a result, various societies of the knights of the golden spur were formed one after another. Maybe there was an aim to commemorate the (wrongly stated) year 265, when in Rome 265 knights of the golden spur were created after the coronation of emperor Frederick III by Pope Nicholas V. The knighting ceremony took place 19 March 1452 at the Bridge of Hadrian, and the new emperor granted the knights with golden spur hanging from the cross.Kassics 1840. p. 299 (Earlier, in 1433 at the same place emperor Sigismund created there more than 200 knights.) We can see creation of knights as part of the coronation ceremony in the Czech Kingdom during the rule of Venceslaus II already in 1297Melchior Goldastus Heiminsfeldius: Commentarii de regni Bohemiae incorporatarumque provinciarum... Francofurti ad Moenum, I. 1719. 483. (Knights of St. Venceslaus, repeated by John of Bohemia in 1311, and Sigismund in 1420, then by almost all Czech kings), as well as in Poland in 1311 (as a result of the Hungarian influence).Emma Bartoniek: A magyar kir√°lykoron√°z√°sok t√∂rt√©nete. Budapest, 1939. p. 52. The origins of different knights of golden spur may be in some way related to various orders of St George. Pierre H√©lyot (and others) saw connections between the Order of Constantine (Ordre de Constantin), \\"founded\\" by the Emperor Constantine I, and knights of golden spur, as well as the different orders of St. George. The collane of Grand Master shows the figure of St George, slaying a dragon.Pierre Place: Histoire des ordres monastiques, religieux et militaires, et des congregations seculieres. Paris, I. 1714. pp. 248‚Äì257. (In some accounts, the Order of Constantine, known also as the Order of Golden Chivalry [in German sources called Constantinorder, earlier Angelusorden] was founded by the Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos in 1190/91. The phrase angelicas [Hungarian: angelik√°k] also originated there.In later times, the grand masters of the order came from the descendants of Isaac II Angelos, with residence in Parma.

So, the order's connection to both the golden knights and St. George is obvious. Since the second wife of Isaac II Angelos was Princess Margaret of Hungary, the daughter of B√©la III, the Hungarian tradition of golden knighthood and St. George may originate from this source, as well.)Magyar katolikus lexikon, headword: Szent Gy√∂rgy lovagrendek; R.

Altenburg-Leipzig, II. 1846. pp. 205‚Äì206.; Carl von Rotteck ‚Äì Karl Welcker szerk.: Staats-Lexikon oder Encyclop√§die der Staatswissenschaften. Altona, XII. 1841. p. 22. The Jesuit Melchior Inchofer writes in his work about Hungarian ecclesiastical history, at the year 1045, that King St Stephen created his son, Prince St Emeric as well as several domestic and foreign magnates Knights of the Holy Cross (Equestrem Crucigerorum), which is in Inchofer's account supported by the fact, that on some ancient pictures, the prince was shown with cross in his neck and on his coat. When Emperor Henry III reinstated King Peter to his throne (1044), several foreigners were created Knights of the Cross in the name of the King, at the Church of Mary in Feh√©rv√°r. At the same time, several Hungarian magnates were created by Henry the Knights of the Golden Spur (Ordinem Auratorum, ab insignibus, quae deaurata Calcaria sunt...), founded by Charlemagne. According to Inchofer, the Order of the Holy Cross was also greatly promoted by St. Ladislaus, who made several donations for them, and all the villages, that are named after the cross (Hungarian kereszt), gave their names as a result of these donations (Szentkereszt, Kereszt√∫r etc.).Melchior Inchofer: Annales ecclesiastici regni Hungariae. Rome, vol. I. 1644\\\\. pp. 384‚Äì386. Inchofer had collected and systematically exploited a huge amount of written sources for his work in the Vatican Archives, which are now lost for ever. For this reason, we can take into consideration his work as well. Inchofer makes report of another Hungarian order, the Knights of Holy Cross, but we have no other evidence whether it really existed. However, there are several older books dealing with chivalric orders that mention a certain Order of St Gerion, founded in the Holy Land. The knights were described as wearing the insignia of Hungary: Gueules, patriarchal cross Argent above a triple hill vert. Some other authors stated, they wore black patriarchal cross above a green triple hill, attached on their white cloaks, and others gave them a completely different cross. However, they do not know nothing about the origin and function of the order. The only common point is that it possibly disappeared, when the Holy Land was lost.Benedetto Giustiniani: Historie cronologiche dell' origine degl' ordini militari. Venezia, II. 1692. pp. 534‚Äì535. ; Adriaan Schoonebeek: Histoire de tous les orders militaires ou de chevalerie. Amsterdam, II. 1699. pp. 118‚Äì119. ; Philippo Bonanni: Ordinum equestrium et militarium catalogus. Romae, 1711. p. XXXXVII. table 150. So, it is possible that we can see here a reminiscence to the Order of Holy Cross, that might existed in reality, which was mixed with the legend of St Gereon.This can be supported by the opinion of Pierre H√©lyot who thought that the Knights of St Gereon may be the same as the Cross- Bearers (Porte-Croix), mentioned by Inchofer in his Hungarian ecclesiastical history, since they wore similar emblem as the coat of arms of the country (Croix Patriarchale pos√©e sur trois montagnes). He then repeats the information of Inchofer, saying that the order was founded by Saint Stephen, and the order could be originated from the cross that was sent to the king by the pope. The king was also entitled to carry this cross before him in the processions. The king was also considered the Apostle of Hungary, because his determined activities in propagation of Christianity. However, the first chivalry orders were created only during the 12th century, so H√©lyot thought that the institution of Cross-Bearers was established, when Pope Sylvester II sent the crown and the cross to the king in 1000. They might be the members of his retinue, to carry the cross before the king. By the time, they might transform themselves into an order (of St Gereon) which is not existing yet.H√©lyot 1714. pp. 281‚Äì282. We can find nearly the same account on the knights of St Gereon (with reference to H√©lyot as well) in the book of Jean Hermant.Jean Hermant: Histoire des religions ou ordres militaires de l'eglise, et des ordres de chevalerie. Rouen, I. 1726. pp. 162‚Äì165. (first edition 1698) In the modern Hungarian literature, the Order of Holy Cross was possibly mentioned first time by Guszt√°v Remellay, who also presented some additional sources for its existence during the late 14th century. He stated, that in the era of king Sigismund the knights of Holy Cross still wore red cross in white field. They must still be very numerous, because King Sigismund in his Regestrum bellicum ordered them to fight under the banner of St George.Guszt√°v Remellay: A r√©gi magyar kereszt-, aranysarkantyu- √©s s√°rk√°nyrendek. Vas√°rnapi √öjs√°g May 31. 1857/22. p. 200. By the end of the 14th century, the traditions of the knights of Holy Cross ‚Äì if we can take it as authentic ‚Äì might be heavily mingled with the traditions of knights of the golden spur, and the Hungarian Knights of St George (or the Knights of Saint George might originate from the Knights of the Holy Cross). If the emblem of the Knights of Holy Cross was (double) cross (due their name), then perhaps this might be the origin of another order with the badge of double cross, the so-called Knights of St Gerion. Furthermore, they could be linked to the Hungarian Order of Saint George in a way that the Hungarian name Gy√∂rgy (en, fr: George, it: Giorgio) was misread by the foreigners, and transformed to the similarly sounding name Gerion. So, the Order of the Holy Cross might be converted by historical development to the knights of the golden spur, and the Hungarian Order of Saint George, and by means of misunderstanding to the Order of Saint Gerion.L√°szl√≥ Szegedi: A magyar heroldi szervezet Zsigmond kor√°ban. Turul 2019. (manuscript under publication) (The attributes of St Gereon are cross- flag, sword, dragon [as a reference of the defeated paganism], and cross on his breastplate.Magyar katolikus lexikon. Headword Gereon. It is also possible that here we can see a Hungarian order founded to the honor of Szent Gell√©rt in the Holy Land and/or Hungary. Its Hungarian spelling is even more closer to the name of Gereon (fr: G√©rard, en: Gerard, it: Gerardo, de: Gerhard). The attributes of St Gerard are: censer, book, pieces of stone, cross.Magyar katolikus lexikon. Headword Gell√©rt However, Gereon is more possible, according to his attributes.) Another common point between knights of golden spur and Knights of Saint George can be found in the Golden Legend of Saint George. The topos of the struggle with the dragon was probably brought back into Europe by crusaders. Fulcher of Chartres (c. 1059-c. 1127) in his Historia Antiochena, writes that a priest serving the crusaders marching on Jerusalem had a vision of a beauteous young man, who said him, that he is Saint George himself, the leader of the Christians, and if they will bring his relics with them to Jerusalem, he will promote them. At the siege of the city, St George appeared in white armor, decorated with a red cross, so, the encouraged besiegers who followed him, were able to take Jerusalem. The proliferation of the story of the knight slaying a dragon, and its wide artistic presentation might be promoted mainly by the Golden Legend of Jacobus da Varagine (c. 1228‚Äì1298), the archbishop of Genoa (1292‚Äì1298), in his collection of the saints' lives (Legenda aurea or Legenda sanctorum, c. 1260). (Near to the city of Silene, in the province of Libya, there was a stagne or a pond like a sea, wherein was a dragon which envenomed all the country. To calm the dragon down, the people of the city gave to him every day two sheep, and when the sheep failed there were taken him people, chosen by lot. So it happed that one day the lot fell upon the king's daughter, whereof the king was sorry, and said unto the people: For the love of the gods take gold and silver and all that I have, and let me have my daughter. The king was refused by the angry people. The king then returned to the people and demanded eight days' respite, and they granted it to him. Meanwhile, St George passed by the city. When he saw the young lady he said to her: Fair daughter, doubt ye no thing hereof for I shall help thee in the name of Jesu Christ. When the dragon appeared, St George was upon his horse, and drew out his sword and garnished him with the sign of the cross, and rode hardily against the dragon which came towards him, and smote him with his spear and hurt him sore and threw him to the ground. (In some other variants, St. George killed the dragon immediately.) And after said to the maid: Deliver to me your girdle, and bind it about the neck of the dragon and be not afeard. When she had done so the dragon followed her as it had been a meek beast and debonair. Then St George said to the people: Ne doubt ye no thing, without more, believe ye in God, Jesu Christ, and do ye to be baptized and I shall slay the dragon. Then the king was baptized and all his people, and St George slew the dragon and smote off his head.) If St George being depicted on the altarpieces, we can usually see him in the knightly armor, or with the dragon. So, St George's legend became part of the tradition of golden knighthood. He is the protector of the knights. Many ecclesiastical and secular knight orders have chosen him a patron saint (Teutonic Order, Knights of Saint George, Order of the Dragon, Order of the Garter etc.). In the lower part of the Holy Crown of Hungary, there can be seen the enameled plate of St George, as well. King Saint Stephen, in the campaign against the Bulgarians (1018), obtained the relics of Saint George and Saint Nicholas in Cesarije. In 1328, king Charles I founded his knightly society in the honor of St George. For many of the Hungarian clan monasteries and temples were also chosen St George as their patron saint. In the legend of the B√°thory family St George also appears as their patron saint. (The legend from the 13th century said, Opos from this family slayed a fearful dragon living in the marsh of Ecsed, with the help of St George.) File:A Constantin Rend nagymestere, Bonanni 1711.

In 1790, the Hungarian jurist Adalbert Barics believed that they were perhaps servants of king St. Stephen, and were obliged to fight with him in the battles; or the first knights might be ordered by king St. Ladislaus to assist at the reburial of St. Stephen in 1083. According to Barics, the knights were entitled to wear golden spurs, and perhaps golden armour. They also were the only persons to enter the royal court with golden horse trappings, and for some patriotic services they had to be rewarded with two times of the value of nobles' reward. If the nobles, for example, received a gold chain worth of two hundred florins, the knights of golden spur had to be donated with a gold chain worth of four hundred florins.Barics 1790. pp. 44‚Äì46., 56‚Äì60.; Hende p. 98. (It is possible that the privileges of Charles I of Hungary from 1327 to magister Doncs also belong to the tradition of the Knights of the Golden Spur. He was entitled to change the Argent parts of his coat of arms, crest and banner to Or, but only in case, if he takes part in the war by the King's side. When Charles I of Hungary died (16 July 1342), three mounted knights were set guard in front of the gates of the Buda church, to personalize the king. According to the Chronicon Pictum of M√°rk K√°lti: \\"One of the gallants was adorned with a tournament dress suitable for the royal dignity, the next with a dress suitable for the spear-struggle, and the third wore the royal majesty's battle-armory... The gallants ... wore golden helmets and their crest was an ostrich [head with horseshoe in the beak]: as like as the gallant king used to wear and use them in his life. ...all these were the king's belongings during his life.\\"K√°lti M√°rk Kr√≥nik√°ja, chapt. 212. Translated by L√°szl√≥ Ger√©b. According to the description, the king had a special armory for the \\"tornamentum\\"s and the \\"hastiludium\\"s, suitable for two different types of tournaments.) The spurs were always seen as symbols of the knighthood, and some of them wore nicely ornate pieces. Representative spurs could also be made of gold.Gyula Krist√≥: Az Anjou-kor h√°bor√∫i. Budapest, 198. p. 250. The knightly rank was mostly expressed by a golden spur. The saying \\"earning the spurs\\" also suggests that the right to wear a spur was identical with the acquisition of a knightly rank. During the 1343 Rome pilgrimage of Queen Elizabeth, the mother of king Louis the Great, her cortege was made of fifty knights of golden spur.Antal P√≥r: Nagy Lajos 1326‚Äì1382. Magyar T√∂rt√©neti √âletrajzok. Budapest, 1892. In 1396, King Sigismund created Resti, the admiral of the Hungarian navy knight of the golden spur, in the city of Ragusa. He was given gold spurs, and gold chain.Kassics 1840. p. 300.It happened at Christmas Day, when King Sigismund was presented with a piece from the Savior's sponge by the Ragusan city council. As the sign of his gratitude, the king created the town's rector (and the admiral of the Hungarian navy), Marino Resti knight of the golden spur, and ordered that this piece should always be passed over to Resti's office successors.Remellay 1857/22. p. 200. On 26 September 1412 Bertholo de Orsini has been taken into the Order of the Dragon, when at his request he was also allowed to see the order's original founding charter in Buda. At the same time, King Sigismund made him his counsellor (consiliariorum et athletarum nostrorum), created him knight of the golden spur (cingulo militis seu militaris preheminentie decore presentialiter adornamus, facientes tibi insignia militie et presertim calcar deauratum ad calcem sinistri pedis tui per nobilem Stephanum de Rozgon aule nostre regalis militem et de dicta societate socialem more et observantia debita in talibus et consueta coram cunctis astantibus apponi et aligari, preserving him the possibility, that ‚Äì when he'll put on aureas imperatorias infulas in urbe Romana ‚Äì he can put a spur on his another leg as well), furthermore, he was also belted with a sword (gladio ancipiti seu ense, cum nos bellum insigne committemus, te nobis astante statuentes expresse et hoc regio decernentes edicto).Elem√©r M√°lyusz, ed.: Zsigmondkori oklev√©lt√°r III. (1411‚Äì1412). Budapest, 1993. 632‚Äì634. 2728. sz√°m On 31 May 1433 Emperor Sigismund created after his coronation in Rome, at Bridge of Hadrian a great number of new knights. Some sources indicate that they were more than 200.Koller, H.: Der St. GeorgsRitterorden Kaiser Friedrichs III.

(If we take into consideration the symbolic year 256, their number might be exactly the same, as like as at the 1452 coronation of Frederick III.) Numerous new knights were also granted Order of the Dragon. Some coat of arms miniatures of Giovanni Francesco Capodilista also show crest and horse cloth semy of golden spurs (along with other insignia on his clothing, and his neck: Order of the Dragon, Order of the Jar, the devise of House of Lancaster the so-called SS- chain). The Capodilista arms was granted in 1434 by emperor Sigismund in Basel, and at the same time he was raised for the knight of golden spur (maybe also granted with the Order of Dragon), appointed as a royal counselor, and granted the title of Pfalzgraf.Martin Roland ‚Äì Andreas Zajic: Illuminierte Urkunde des Mittelalters in Mitteleuropa.

The new knights were also created by him.√Årp√°d Ker√©kgy√°rt√≥: Haz√°nk √©vlapjai. Magyarorsz√°g t√∂rt√©net√©nek kortani √°tn√©zete, 884‚Äì1849. Budapest, 1875. 266. King Matthias made new knights not only during his coronation, but also on some festive occasions. On 24 June 1488 in Vienna (under Hungarian occupation that time) the Swiss Envoy Melchior Russ was knighted, in the presence of the courtiers and ten foreign ambassadors.Dezs≈ë Cs√°nki: I. M√°ty√°s udvara. Budapest, 1884. pp. 105‚Äî108., 152‚Äî153. Jol√°n Balogh: M√°ty√°s kir√°ly ikonogr√°fi√°ja. Budapest, 1900. p. 450., 528. Lajos Elekes: Kir√°lyi √©s f≈ë√≥ri udvar.

According to a report of the Swiss ambassador Schilling, there were only 12 such knights throughout Hungary.J√°nos Szendrei: M√°ty√°s kor√°nak hadi eml√©kei.

These persons were not members of a knightly order but the personal knights of the king. During the 15th century, creation of new knights of golden spur became regular. In some cases it happened even independently of coronation. On 28 February 1514 Gy√∂rgy D√≥zsa was knighted for a winning duel fought in the area of N√°ndorfeh√©rv√°r, against the Ali of Epeiros, the leader of the mounted sipahis of Szendr≈ë. As a reward, king Louis II granted him with a double service pay, golden chain, purple dress richly embroidered with gold, spur and sword. Furthermore, he also gained 200 gold florins, a village between N√°ndorfeh√©rv√°r and Temesv√°r. Finally, he was entitled to augment his family coat of arms with Ali's cut off arm, as a reminder to his heroic deeds.Iv√°n Nagy: Magyarorsz√°g csal√°dai nemz√©krendi t√°bl√°kkal. Pest, 1858. III. pp. 363‚Äì364. In 1522, Istv√°n B√°rdi became knight in a similar way. That year, the Hungarians sought a victory against the Turkish leader Ferhates. They also captured several higher and lower ranked officers, and sent various war insignia for the king to Buda. The good news was brought to the king by B√°rdi, who also showed great courage in the battle. As a reward, king Louis II renumerated him with a silvery-scabbarded sword, a gold necklace, a pair of gold spurs, and made him knight of the golden spur in presence of several high ranked noble gentlemen.Czir√°ky 1792. 11. This information was taken from Mikl√≥s Istv√°nffy. (Hist. Lib. VII. p. m. 66.) In the beginning, it was not stated in advance who will be knighted during the coronation. In 1563, at the coronation of king Maximilian I some nobles were knighted who fought successfully in Turkish wars, like Gy√∂rgy Thury, Antal Sz√©kely, L√°szl√≥ Gyulaffy and Mikl√≥s Hennyey.Kassics 1840. p. 304. However, there also appeared a lot of people who were unworthy of honoring this title, but simply jostled themselves forward during the coronation, so the knighting ceremony had to be abandoned. For this reason, in later times the palatine (the military leader of the country) was entitled to choose the candidates for knighting.Bartoniek 1939. p. 126. In 1598, Archduke Matthias made knights of golden spur Ferenc N√°dasdy and Mikl√≥s P√°lffy in Gy≈ër, newly recaptured from the Turks. New knights were made in 1608, during the coronation of Matthias II.Nagy L√°szl√≥: Az Er≈ës Fekete b√©g. N√°dasdy Ferenc. Budapest, 1987. pp. 77‚Äì78. The first statute was the 1609:73 which mentions those young nobles whom the Hungarian king used to knight after the coronation.P√©ter B√°n ed.: Magyar t√∂rt√©nelmi fogalomt√°r. Pozsony, I. p. 35. At that time, King Matthias II obliged the new knights to pay a contribution of 12 golden florins. In 1687, Joseph, the 9 years old son of Leopold I was crowned for the king of Hungary. Since he was still a young boy, he could not create new knights. For this reason, Leopold I made him the Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece first, and let him swore their oath, and so in the knightly sense, he now had the right to make new knights of the golden spur.Bartoniek 1939. p. 151. For a long time, the coronation of Hungarian kings, and the new knightings took place in the Franciscan church of Pressburg, the then capital city of Hungary. Over the time, most of the knights came from the prominent families of Hungary, but almost all the social strata participated in knightings. According to the Hungarian jurist Ign√°c Kassics, in 1691 king Leopold I knighted his favorite court servant, a certain Hannibal Dascoli, but this time the primarily personal title was given to his male descendants, as well, as a reward for the military merits made by him and his ancestors. At the same time, he was given the ornaments of the order: belts, necklaces, rings, spurs, other ornaments of the order, and a special diploma of knightment.Kassics 1840. p. 300. In 1840, Kassics also describes the insignia of the order,Kassics 1840. p. 301. (probably referring back to the 1742 book of J√≥zsef Pint√©rPint√©r 1742. pp. 144‚Äì146.: a cross-shaped golden \\"decorative medal\\" hanging from the gold necklace. In the middle of the cross was placed the shield of Hungary, besides a lion is standing edgewise, and above is the Holy Crown of Hungary floating. According to Kassics, in his times, the knights were also privileged, not to put off their swords when taking an oath.Kassics 1840. p. 302. Still another description says, they had a \\"coat of arms\\" in the shape of a four-pronged gold spur [rather a cross], with a similar, but much smaller, gold spur, hanging down from one of the bigger ones [one of the coross' pronges]. D√°niel Gombos: Polg√°ri √©lethez val√≥ lexicon. Debrecen, I. 1837. 126‚Äì127. (\\"Ennek a' Rendnek cz√≠mere, egy n√©gy √°g√∫ arany sarkanty√∫ [kereszt], melynek egygyik√©n [egyik sz√°r√°n] hasonl√≥, de sokkal kissebb arany sarkanty√∫cska f√ºgg.\\") The source of this description was the book by S√°muel Decsy (1742‚Äì1816), titled A magyar szent koron√°nak √©s az ahoz tartoz√≥ t√°rgyaknak histori√°ja (Vienna, 1792. paragraph 367), but it is just a reference to Pint√©r. According to Decsy, the history of the knights of golden spur earlier was described by J√°nos Decsi (Cimor) (c. 1560‚Äì1601), under the name of Baronius. However, this badge may refer to the papal knights of golden spur, because Baronius thought, the Hungarian knights of golden spur may originate from the papal order, as well. (Compare to the figure of Pint√©r from the year \\"265\\".) It seems that in the later times the badges of the knights were forgotten, because in 1792 Count Antal Czir√°ky (who was himself eques auratus in 1790) petitioned the court to create wearable insignia for the knights.Czir√°ky: De Ordine Eqvitvm Avrvm Hvngariae... He proposed a badge (p. 30) in the form of an eight edged Maltese cross hanging from a neck-ribbon. However, despite the repeated requests, the claim was never met, neither by Leopold II nor by his successors. Czir√°ky also stated,Czir√°ky op. cit. p. 25. the spurs to be seen on the tombstone of prince L≈ërinc √öjlaki (1459/60-1524) were the original badges of knights of the golden spur. (The spurs at the tombstone of his father, Mikl√≥s √öjlaki [1410 k.-1477], king of Bosnia are even more characteristic. He wears spurs unstrapped from his ankles, superimposed to the feet-armours.)

The number of the knights was different on each coronation. Albert I knighted 84 persons,Ker√©kgy√°rt√≥ 258. Charles III 6, Maria Theresa 44 (25 nobles and 19 citizens), Leopold II 33, Francis II 48, Ferdinand I 27, Franz Joseph I 28, Charles IV. 47. In the latter coronation, all the knights came from the battlefield soldiers. Half of them originated from old noble families, and there were also soldiers from various military corps. The soldiers were allowed to left the front or the hospital facilities to participate the coronation. Originally, 51 persons received invitations, but only 47 of them arrived to the coronation in time. The intention was to raise those soldiers for knights of golden spur who already were given war medals for their valiant conduct against the enemy.Gergely P√°l Sallay ‚Äì J√°nos Szentv√°ry-Luk√°cs p. 35.

His aim goes back to some older descriptions telling that the Hungarian knights of golden spur wore a small gold spur not just on their boots, but beneath their hat buttercups, as well. In 2011, the knightly society has been re-established as a real order in Esztergom (the first knightings were made on 30 April), under the name Aranysarkanty√∫s Vit√©zi Lovagrend (Ordine Equitum Auratorum, Ritterorden vom Goldenen Sporn). The foundation was made by the knowledge of Otto von Habsburg (1912‚Äì2011), but without his direct participation. The order has three classes, but did not take over the 1918 decorative medal. (However, the badge resembles the medal described by Kassics in 1840.) For this reason, it has to be seen, as a distinct order. However, they confess themselves to the history of the Hungarian knights of golden spur. As the first grand master was appointed Archduke S√°ndor Habsburg-Lothringen (1965‚Äì ), member of the Tuscan branch of the Habsburg family.http://www.aranysarkantyus.hu/ and https://spornritter.com/ and https://www.facebook.com/AranysarkantyusLovagrend/ File:A 2011-ben l√©trehozott Aranysarkanty√∫s Vit√©zi Lovagrend c√≠mere.pngCoat of arms of Aranysarkanty√∫s Vit√©zi Lovagrend File:A 2011-ben l√©trehozott Aranysarkanty√∫s Vit√©zi Lovagrend c√≠mere,.pngCoat of arms of Aranysarkanty√∫s Vit√©zi Lovagrend File:Az Aranysarkanty√∫s Vit√©zi Lovagrend lovagi oszt√°lya.pngKnight File:Az Aranysarkanty√∫s Vit√©zi Lovagrend priori oszt√°lya.pngPrior File:Aranysarkanty√∫s Vit√©zi Lovagrend, kancell√°r, nagyprior.pngChancellor, Grand Prior File:Habsburg S√°ndor 1, nagymester, Lorettom, 2012. okt√≥ber 13.jpgArchduke S√°ndor Habsburg-Lothringen (1965- ), Grand Master of the order File:Habsburg S√°ndor 2, Esztergom - nagymesteri beiktat√°s, 2012. j√∫nius 9.jpgInvestiture of Grand Master, Esztergom 2012 File:Habsburg S√°ndor 3, Esztergom - nagymesteri beiktat√°s, 2012. j√∫nius 9.jpgInvestiture of Grand Master, Esztergom 2012 File:Habsburg S√°ndor 4, lovagavat√°s, Ipolydam√°sd,2018. j√∫nius 10.jpgCreation of new knights, 2018 File:Habsburg S√°ndor 5, lovagavat√°s, Ipolydam√°sd,2018. j√∫nius 10.jpgCreation of new knights, 2018 File:Habsburg S√°ndor 6, korona≈ër√∂k √©s lovagok, Budapest, 2014. j√∫nius 21.jpgGuards of the Holy Crown of Hungary as well as knights and the Grand Master of Aranysarkanty√∫s Vit√©zi Lovagrend References Literature J√≥zsef Pint√©r: Conspectus equestrium ordinum per Europam omnem florentium.

Built about 1820, it is a good local example of a vernacular Federal period farmhouse, with a well-preserved interior and unusual floorplan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The George Atwater House is located in southeastern Hamden, on the east side of State Street (United States Route 5) near its junction with Hyde Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Unusual for the Federal period, its roof ridge is oriented perpendicular to the road, with the main entrance facing the street in the rightmost of three bays. The main roof gable is fully pedimented, with a half-round window at its center. The entrance is sheltered by an early 20th-century gabled portico supported by square posts, with a half-round transom-like pattern in its gable that stylistically echoes the window in the main gable. Windows are set in retangular openings, with projecting cornices above. The interior retains many period finishes, including a particularly fine carved fireplace surround in the main parlor. The interior layout is unusual because of the presence of an original single- story ell projecting to the north, where the kitchen was originally placed. A mid-19th century gabled ell also extends to the south at an offset. With The Atwater family had owned land in this area since the early years of the New Haven Colony in the 17th century, with early settler David Atwater owning hundreds of acres here. George Atwater, one of his descendants, built this house about 1820. After dying childless, the house and land passed to his nephews, and remained within that family until 1933.

Built about 1781 by a descendant of one of the area's first settlers, it was the home of engraver and political activist William James Linton in the late 19th century. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The Atwater-Linton House is located in southeastern Hamden, on the west side of State Street (United States Route 5), between Hyde and Benton Streets. Set farther back from the street than surrounding later construction, it is a 1-1/2 story Cape style wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Two gabled dormers project from the front roof face, which extends beyond the facade to provide a porch space supported by modern iron supports. A hip-roof porch extends across part of the south-facing left side. Victorian trim has been applied to portions of the exterior. The interior of the house largely reflects a c. 1880 restyling. With The Atwater family were longtime owners of land in this area, with early settler David Atwater owning hundreds of acres in the 17th century. Jared Atwater, his descendant, had this house built not long after acquiring some of that land in 1781. It is believed to be the oldest standing house in the area associated with this family. It was leased in 1870 by Linton, a British wood- engraver and political activist, who named it \\"Appledore\\" after the apple orchard on the hill above. Linton was responsible for the Victorian alterations to the house. He lived here for thirty years, creating many wood- engravings, and engaging in correspondence with a wide array of literary and social figures.

Irish Greyhound Derby champion Toms The Best trained by Nick Savva was voted Greyhound of the Year after finishing runner-up in the Scottish Greyhound Derby at Shawfield Stadium and winning the 1998 English Greyhound Derby. Linda Mullins won Greyhound Trainer of the Year for the third successive year. The industry lost Wembley when it was announced that greyhound racing would no longer take place there. The last race was held on Friday 18 December. A twist of fate resulted in a no race on that final night after a hare failure, just like 71 years previous when on the opening night in 1927 the same happened. Tracks Independent track Long Eaton in the hands of the receivers Grant Thompson suffered a catastrophic grandstand fire on Sunday 27 December. The receivers had hoped to sell it for ¬£1.5 million to developers but the Erewash council had voted unanimously (44-0) that the track would remain a sporting venue. However that plan was scuppered after the fire which local police treated as suspicious. With no grandstand anyone interested in bringing back racing had pulled out of negotiations. Leading owner, Pat Chambers, had been involved in a scheme to buy the track in January. News Wembley Racing Manager John Rowley left the sport whilst Peter Miller moved to Hove. Wembley trainers Ken Tester and Terry Atkins relocated to Catford before switching to Crayford and Oxford respectively, Patsy Cusack joined Crayford and Hazel Dickson joined Wimbledon, John Haynes kept a small kennel to open race, while Wally Ginzel and Pam Heasman would both soon retire. The Sporting Life closed in May after a merger with the Racing Post; it was the end of an era for the newspaper that had served greyhound racing for decades and its editor Bob Betts. Subsequently the Racing Post sponsored a new festival of racing at Walthamstow. Seven-time champion trainer John McGee Sr. returned to England after spending four years in Ireland. He leased the Halls Green Farm kennels in Roydon, Essex, where former Walthamstow stars were reared, after selling his Woodlands Kennels in County Kildare. His relationship with the NGRC remained fractious and they announced that they would not be licence him until he met the ¬£30,000 legal bill accumulated from the failed high court ban back in 1994. After agreeing a payment he was given an attachment at Rye House. Meanwhile at Peterborough Racing Manager Mike Middle retired and was replaced by Con Baker. Sheffield won the Supertrack (a competition between tracks); they beat the competition which included hosts Walthamstow by scoring 81 points; Walthamstow finished 2nd with 69 points with Henlow in third with 39. Competitions The last Grand National at Hall Green was won by a greyhound called El Tenor trained by Linda Mullins and owned by Italian film producer Mario Lanfranchi. The brindle dog had won the Essex Vase in 1996 before being disqualified and being switched to hurdles and then won 9 from 13 before the Grand National. During the final El Tenor came from off the pace to catch and beat Quote That and Mullins saw a gap in the open race circuit over stayers hurdles. No other greyhound could compete with him over staying hurdles events and he won many open races throughout the year and passed Poor Sue's record of 69 open victories when picking up another victory at Nottingham in December. In the Pall Mall Stakes at Oxford Stadium Droopys Eric took a length off Carmels Prince's eight year old track record beating Blue Murlen in the process. Later following a major car accident Droopys Eric was injured with a kennelmate dying and passenger Olive Tasker seriously injured. Eric was withdrawn from the semi finals. Ernie Gaskin Sr. won his third trainer's championship when winning the event at Sittingbourne. During the Golden Jacket final Bubbly Princess won but was then disqualified by the stewards, the connections were waiting at the podium when the announcement took place.

Premi Viswanath and Nirupam Paritala are the main protagonists of the series. The show has consistently topped the ratings chart since its inception. The show is the remake of Malayalam television series Karuthamuthu which is being aired on Asianet channel.  Plot  The story is about Deepa and Karthik; Deepa is a swarthy girl and Karthik's mother Soundarya dislikes Deepa because of her skin colour. Deepa has a fair-skinned step-sister Sravya who falls in love with Karthik and Karthik's brother Aditya is in love with Sravya. Aditya tells his mother of his love and Soundarya accepts the relation as Sravya is a fair- skinned girl. Later Soundarya proposes the relation to Sravya's parents and they accept the relation. Sravya is stunned and feels happy as she assumes she will marry Kartik, but later learns that the proposal is between her and Karthik's younger brother Aditya. Amidst this Karthik and Deepa frequently encounter each other and Karthik is impressed by Deepa's kindness and generosity. Sravya blackmails Karthik to marry her or else she will commit suicide Karthik says he will talk with his mother after her (Sravya's) birthday party which is arranged by Soundarya later Karthik meets Deepa and Sravya's father and asks his permission to marry Deepa and reveals that he cannot sire children and asks Deepa's father to tell this to Deepa. If she accepts this, he will marry her in a temple. Deepa's father is unable to find relations for Deepa and accepts the proposal, but doesn't inform Deepa about Karthik's inability to have children. Deepa is happy that a man with a good heart will marry her. On Sravya's birthday Karthik marries Deepa without anyone from either side and brings her to the birthday party. Soundarya becomes angry that Karthik married the swarthy girl. Sravya is furious that Karthik married her elder sister not her. Aditya, Karthik's younger brother and Karthik's father (Anandrao) are happy, however. After some insults, Soundarya allows Deepa to be in the house and later Sravya marries Aditya but Sravya wants to get rid of Deepa and Aditya and wants to marry Karthik but she eventually fails and Soundarya senses odd behavior of Sravya and warns her to be a good wife and daughter-in-law or she will expel. Sravya stops the attempts and starts loving Aditya. A new character, Monitha(Shoba Shetty), enters, she was Karthik's childhood friend. Soundarya likes Monitha as she is fair-skinned. Monitha becomes angry when she learns Karthik is married and promises herself she will get him back. Sravya is pregnant and Monitha kills the baby and makes everyone accuse Deepa of it. Deepa proves she did not kill the baby and consults a doctor as she wants to get pregnant and wants to know why she isn't expecting yet and Karthik discusses this with Monitha and Monitha convinces Karthik to change the reports before all of this. Karthik and Deepa go on a honeymoon. Monitha is there. A new character, Vihari, Deepa's favorite novelist is introduced and Monitha makes Karthik believe Deepa is cheating on him with Vihari. Meanwhile Deepa ties a rakhi to Vihari as a brother. They return from the honeymoon and Monitha manipulates Karthik more and more so he blindly believes Deepa is cheating on him. Currently, Deepa believes the reports that she can't have children. Soundarya learns of this and wants Karthik to marry again. Monitha is happy about this as she believes Soundarya will choose her to be Karthik's second wife but is betrayed when Soundarya chooses someone else. Soundarya informs Karthik that she will engage him to another women the next day. Karthik is shocked by this and asks Deepa if she knows about the engagement while Deepa is fast asleep. Deepa doesn't answer. The next day Deepa awakens and is shocked to hear about preparations of engagement. Deepa cries, thinking doctorbabu (Karthik) accepts this. Deepa's father learns of the engagement and stops it. Soundarya lashes out at him, saying Deepa can't bear the children before Deepa's father could tell the truth, Deepa faints. A guest checks her and tells Soundarya Karthik doesn't need to marry again as Deepa is pregnant. This shocks everyone, including Karthik. Deepa hears of the pregnancy and is happy. Sravya still blames Deepa for her miscarriage. Soundarya makes Deepa promise on God's harathi that she isn't the reason behind Sravya's miscarriage. Deepa promises and Soundarya believes her. Soundarya starts to care for Deepa, as she bears the heir of their house. Meanwhile Karthik once again goes to test whether or not he can have children. It is revealed that he can, but Monitha changes the reports to state he cannot. It is revealed that Monitha is responsible for Karthik's misconception. Monitha tells her maternal uncle that she has loved Karthik from her college days. Karthik loved another girl, Hima. She planned an accident when they were going on a roadtrip and she killed Hima and bribed the doctor to say Karthik cannot have children so Karthik doesn't marry anyone else and so she could complete her studies in the USA and return and marry him. Ironically Karthik is a Cardiologist and Monitha is a Gynaecologist. After seeing Soundarya love and care for Deepa, Monitha attempts to kill her multiple times, but fails. Monitha approaches the serial killer Durga who only kills bad people. Monitha convinces him that Deepa cheated on her friend Karthik. Durga accepts the deal and enters as the car driver especially for Deepa. Deepa is sad that Karthik is behaving oddly with her and showing no sign of happiness for the pregnancy. Deepa goes to her parents where even her father treats her weirdly, so a tearful Deepa returns. After seeing Deepa's kindness, Durga is convinced that Monitha is the bad one. Monitha learns of this and convinces Durga she won't harm Deepa anymore but Durga doesn't believe her and remains the car driver to protect Deepa from Monitha. Monitha plans to kill both of them as she killed Hima, but they escape with few injuries. Later Durga confesses to Deepa he was there to kill her. Hearing this, a stunned Deepa asks who wants to kill her, as she never harmed anyone her entire life. Durga says Karthik to protect Monitha as he is in love with Monitha. Deepa returns home and prepares to leave the house, but Soundarya stops her and asks why she wants to leave the house. A tearful Deepa tells Soundarya that doctorbabu (Karthik) wants to kill her. Hearing this, the family is shocked and they ask Karthik why he wants to kill his pregnant wife and Karthik says he may dislike her but would never try to kill her. Furious, he spills the truth, saying he isn't the father of the child, shocking Deepa. Soundarya slaps Karthik, telling him to watch his words. Karthik shows the reports to the family and everyone becomes silent. A betrayed Deepa leaves the house saying she can't live in a house where her loyalty and love are questioned. She goes to her parents' house and confronts her father regarding him knowing the truth from the beginning and storms off. A guilty father tries to stops her and asks her to live with him, but Deepa says even he doubted her and leaves. Soundarya believes, but Anandara and Aditya don't believe Kartik and ask to take the tests again but Monitha convinces him not to. Deepa tries to find a job so she can take care of the baby. She works in a petrol bunk. Soundarya and Karthik come to the bunk to fill up the tank, but Soundarya feels sad for her and they leave. One day Vihari's interview airs on a channel and Soundarya is furious as Karthik told her Deepa cheated on him with Vihari. Soundarya goes to Vihari's house and confronts him. Vihari shows a letter written by Deepa. This society would misunderstand the brother and sister relationship, too. Soundarya is upset, realizing Deepa isn't guilty and searches for her, asks for her forgiveness, asks her to return to the house, and says she will convince Karthik. But Deepa refuses. Soundarya leaves Deepa and tries to help her financially, but Deepa rejects the money out of self- respect. Later Soundarya tries to convince Karthik to take the test, but Karthik doesn't listen to her after so many hurdles. Deepa gives birth to twins and Soundarya takes one baby away so the babies can reconcile their parents. Soundarya takes the dark-skinned baby with her to redeem herself for mistreating Deepa while she was in the house. Deepa awakens and caresses her remaining baby. Soundarya takes the baby home and says she got the baby from an orphanage so Karthik could care for her. Karthik initially doesn't care for the baby, but slowly begins to love her. They name the baby Hima and Deepa names her baby Sourya. Deepa leaves the city to live peacefully with her baby.  Crossovers  Karthika Deepam had crossovers with Siri Siri Muvvalu (Ep.457-Ep.462) when Hima ran away from home and was found by Kavya(Marina Abraham) and Lakshmi Kalyanam (Ep.90,Ep.109 & Ep.248). Lakshmi Kalyanam was seen in Karthika Deepam for a regular maha episode where Lakshmi tries to unite Deepa and Karthik and a dusshera special episode.

Later on, after the death of Hofstede de Groot he planned to compile his findings in a book, but was interrupted by WWII. He finally published in 1944 and this remained the definitive update to Emile Michel's version in 1887 until it was updated by Sturla Gudlaugsson in 1960. He was director and co-owner with Kurt Benedict of the Galerie van Diemen & Co. which had offices in Berlin, Amsterdam, The Hague, and NYC. The Berlin office organized the first exhibition of Russian art in 1922, but it closed in 1935.

He served in three wars and completed his career as deputy chief of staff for Research, Development and Studies at Headquarters Marine Corps. He was the older brother of actor, Jerry Haynes aka Mr. Peppermint, and uncle of musician & artist Gibby Haynes. Early years Fred E. Haynes was born on January 5, 1921, in Dallas, Texas, as the son of Fred E. Haynes Sr. & Louise Schimelpfenig and had four siblings: Jerry, William, Hal and sister Mary Louise. He spent his childhood in Plano, Texas, where his maternal grandfather Frederick Schimelpfenig served as mayor and later operated a grocery store. He attended the Plano High School and following the graduation in summer of 1937, he enrolled in the Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Haynes was active in football and track teams during his time at the university and was the vice president of Delta Phi Alpha fraternity in his senior year. He graduated in June 1941 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology. Military career World War II Following his graduation, he worked as reporter for the Dallas Morning News, but after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, he decided to volunteer for the military service. Haynes entered the Marine Corps Reserve as private on March 13, 1942, and was attached to Reserve Officers' Class at Officer Candidates School at Quantico Base, Virginia. He completed the course on June 13, 1942, and was commissioned second lieutenant on that date. He subsequently attended the Platoon Leaders Course in August of that year and then accepted regular commission. Haynes was then appointed an instructor and platoon leader at Quantico and took part in the training of new officers. During his duties there, he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in February 1943. Haynes was transferred to Camp Pendleton, California in February 1944 and attached to the newly activated 28th Marine Regiment under the command of decorated Marine Raider, Colonel Harry B. Liversedge. He was promoted to the rank of captain one month later and appointed regimental assistant to the regimental operations officer, Major Oscar F. Peatross. Haynes subsequently took part in the extensive training and finally sailed to the Pacific theater in October 1944, reaching Hawaii during the same month. The 28th Marines were stationed at Camp Tarawa and conducted amphibious training for next four months. The 28th Marine Regiment sailed as part of the 5th Marine Division under Major General Keller E. Rockey for Iwo Jima in February 1945 and Haynes landed with the assault troops on Green Beach in the morning of February 19. Haynes participated in the planning and assault on Mount Suribachi and remained in combat area until the end of March. He was decorated with the Bronze Star Medal with Combat \\"V\\" for his bravery in action, and also received a Navy Presidential Unit Citation. Postwar service Fred E. Haynes Jr. shown here as Captain during the Battle of Iwo Jima in February 1945. Following Iwo Jima, the 28th Marines sailed back for Hawaii in order to prepare for the Invasion of Japan, but the surrender of the Empire at the beginning of September 1945 changed their plans. Haynes subsequently sailed to Japan with his regiment and took part in the occupation duties at Sasebo. The 28th Marines were ordered back to the United States for deactivation in December and Haynes was transferred to the 6th Marine Regiment under Colonel James P. Berkeley, where he served as Operations officer of 1st then 3rd Battalions. Haynes returned to the United States in August 1946 and decided to remain on active service. He was ordered to Washington, D.C., for duty at Headquarters Marine Corps with the division of Plans and Policies and served in that capacity under Brigadier General Gerald C. Thomas until June 1949, when he was promoted to the rank of major and transferred back to his native Texas. He then spent three years as associate professor of naval science at the University of Texas at Austin and was ordered for instruction to the Amphibious Warfare School at Quantico, Virginia, in June 1952.

He also advised presidential candidates, as well as sitting presidents, on the treatment of those captured during battle.

The law was drafted by government adviser Max Sering.Gerschenkron, p. 104.Gessner, p. 765. He declared that the purpose of the law was not to \\"smash up the large estates\\" but to foster a \\"healthy mixture\\" of small, medium and large farms.Gerschenkron, p. 104. Under the law reclaimed land and public land were to be provided for farming.Tracy, p. 188. More controversially the law also included a clause that ordered that in districts where estates of at least 100 hectares made up more than 10% of farmland, a third of their land should be made available.Tracy, p. 188. This was dubbed the \\"Baltic Third\\" (baltische Drittel) and originated in the promise made by the Baltic aristocracy in 1915 to give a third of their land to the government for resettlement, with modest compensation.Tracy, p. 188. However, the power of the Junkers meant that only approximately a quarter of this land was surrendered to the government.Tracy, p. 188. The law did not significantly alter the ownership structure of German agriculture.Gerschenkron, p. 104. During the period 1919-1933 57,000 new farmers were settled on just over 600,000 hectares of land.Tracy, p. 188. According to Alexander Gerschenkron, with the passing of the law \\"a momentous decision was taken. German democracy rejected the road of agrarian revolution, the road traveled by most of the countries in which the economic power of large estate owners was curbed after the World War. Germany chose the way of gradual reform. Translated into the realistic language of practical politics, this meant that the Junkers had been saved again\\".Gerschenkron, p. 104.

Taxonomy This species has been split into two species of the paraphyletic white-collared seedeater, which are not known to intergrade. The S. (t.) torqueola group, comprising the subspecies torqueola and atriceps and commonly known as the cinnamon-rumped seedeater, is found from Sinaloa and Durango to western and southern Oaxaca. S. morelleti group, comprising the subspecies morelleti, sharpei, and mutanda and commonly known as Morelet's seedeater, is found throughout the rest of the species' range. Distribution and habitat It ranges from a small area along the Rio Grande near San Ignacio, Texas in the United States south through eastern Mexico and Central America to Panama. It mainly inhabits tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands but can also be found in pastures, arable land, and heavily degraded former forests. Foraging The Morelet's seedeater eats mainly seeds and insects, and occasionally berries. It often forages on herbaceous plants, and less often on the ground. In captivity, it drinks and bathes often, but in the wild no drinking was observed, even though more than 300 hours of field notes were taken. References Further reading Book * Eitniear, J. C. 1997.

It was built in 1925. The bridge is owned by the Murray River Council, and is also called the Tooleybuc Bridge over Murray River. The bridge was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 and the Victorian Heritage Register on 10 July 2008.  History  Tooleybuc lies on the extreme west fringe of the saltbush plain, a semi-arid or arid area created by sediments from the Murray-Darling flood waters. The saltbush provided useful fodder and the Murray frontage in this area, as in others, was largely taken up by 1847. Tooleybuc was on the Puon Buon run, part of the 1840s pastoral empire of Ben Boyd, the whaling entrepreneur of Twofold Bay. In the 1850s Puon Buon was owned by William Degraves and then Christopher Bagot: in the 1860s the Trust and Agency Co. ran 32,000 sheep there and in the late nineteenth century J. Lawrence held the property and ran 50,000 sheep. The high stocking was encouraged by the almost permanent lakes on Puon Buon. Development of the township of Tooleybuc was assisted by the sub-division of the huge station just before World War I. The Tooleybuc area subsequently became the seen of intensive agriculture, with fruit-growing the principal cash-crop. The river steamers were fundamental to the wool-trade in the nineteenth century; so was easy communication across the river. A vehicular punt was in operation by the 1870s, with a riverside hotel (the Tooley Buc) on the New South Wales side. Finally in 1925, in response to pressure from fruit-growers, the present lift- span bridge was erected by the NSW Department of Public Works, just upstream from the old privately owned punt. The bridge was designed by Percy Allan, and was his final lift span bridge.  Description  The Tooleybuc Bridge is a single-lane timber Allan truss and steel lift span bridge across the Murray River at Tooleybuc. The main axis of the bridge is north-south. There are three main spans including one lift span, supported on concrete piers. On the northern approach there are no approach spans, and there are three approach spans at the Victorian end. The two main truss spans of are of the Allan Type. These trusses support timber cross girders and steel longitudinal stringers. The latter are unusual and are probably replacements of the original timber stringers. The deck is timber. The lift span superstructure is of riveted lattice steel, including the main support girders. The lift span has been converted recently to allow hydraulic operation. The lift span deck is timber on steel girders. The piers to the main spans are concrete with oval diaphragms giving a similar appearance to the cast iron piers under older bridges. The piers are protected by sheet pile cofferdams and filling. The approach spans (two being long each, and one being long) are timber girders. There are five girders to each span supported on timber corbels. The piers to the approach spans, and the junction of approach span to main truss, are all timber trestles. There is no footway, but there is a timber handrail except on the lift span which has a pipe handrail. The deck is above flood level.  Condition  As at 23 June 2005, the bridge was in fair condition having had considerable maintenance in previous years.  Future bridge  In May 2016, NSW Roads and Maritime Services in conjunction with VicRoads released final plans for a replacement high-level bridge across the Murray River, located downriver of the existing bridge. The plans involve a realignment and extension of the Mallee Highway (B12) to commence in Tooleybuc, New South Wales, east of the junction of Lockharts Road, Murray Street, and Lea Street, effectively bypassing the town centre of Tooleybuc. The highway would extend west and then south as it crosses the Murray, before reconnecting with the former Tooleybuc Road, renamed as the Mallee Highway, that connects with the Murray Valley Highway (B400), north of , Victoria. , the NSW Roads and Maritime Services announced that the existing dual heritage-listed Tooleybuc Bridge would be added to the New South Wales conservation list of bridges. The bridge will be conserved to ensure its strength, safety and accessibility for the local community.  Heritage listing  Tooleybuc Bridge over Murray River was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 and on the Victorian Heritage Register on 10 July 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales and/or Victoria. The only two surviving Murray River bridges with Allan truss spans, or Allan- designed lift spans, are Swan Hill and Tooleybuc. Swan Hill was the first of its type to be constructed anywhere, and Tooleybuc the last. The bridge has regional historical significance through this association with Percy Allan. It also has local historical significance in the evolving pattern of river traffic. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales and/or Victoria. The Tooleybuc Bridge has aesthetic significance due to its setting and size. Within the town it has landmark qualities. The bridge provides a gateway from Victoria to New South Wales and the town of Tooleybuc, and reciprocal contact between New South Wales and Victoria. The bridge dominates the river valley which provides the focus of recreational activity in the township. The setting is not rare on the Murray River, being similar to Swan Hill. The Tooleybuc Bridge is of technical (scientific) significance for its sophisticated design and construction. The Tooleybuc Bridge was the last of a series of bridges over the Murray River that incorporated central lift spans with innovative truss spans. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales and/or Victoria for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Tooleybuc Bridge has significance to the adjacent towns as the main crossing of a major barrier to communication (the Murray River). The bridge is a focal point to transport, and also provides the only gateway between the states of Victoria and New South Wales. The Tooleybuc Bridge is of historical significance for its role in facilitating interstate trade between New South Wales and Victoria.

In recognition of his role, admirers sometimes describe him as \\"the man who invented data protection\\". He was appointed Chief Data Protection Commissioner for the state of Hessen in 1975, and remained in post till 1991. When the West German government prepared for the 1978 launch of a national equivalent, he was seen by commentators as the obvious choice for the post of Federal Commissioner for Data Protection. He was indeed offered the job, but he rejected it in protest against the government decision, taken shortly before launch, to cut the resources allocated to the new department. That involved reducing the staffing level at the new commission from 32 - \\"previously agreed as necessary\\" - to 20. \\"The state of Bavaria on its own is budgeting no fewer than twenty data- protection staff for the coming year - a telling comparison\\" (\\"Allein das Land Bayern sehe f√ºr Datenschutz-Aufgaben in seinem eigenen Bereich im kommenden Jahr nicht weniger als zwanzig Bedienstete vor -- eine \\"bezeichnende Relation\\"\\"). Spiros Simitis obtained West German citizenship in 1975. His younger brother, Costas Simitis, served as Prime Minister of Greece and was leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) between 1996 and 2004.  Biography  Spiros Simitis was born in Athens. Georgios Simitis, his father, was a lawyer and law professor. He completed his schooling in Athens. Directly after that, with his brother Costas Simitis, he moved to West Germany for university-level education in law. The brothers studied at the University of Marburg, where between 1952 and 1956 Spiros Simitis worked for his degree and doctorate in jurisprudence. He received his doctorate for work completed in 1956 on \\"Actual contractual relationships as an expression of the changing social purpose of legal principals in civil law\\" (\\"Die faktischen Vertragsverh√§ltnisse als Ausdruck der gewandelten sozialen Funktion der Rechtsinstitute des Privatrechts\\"). He then moved a short distance south, to Frankfurt University, where he worked as a research assistant till 1962/63. His ambition was to make his career in the universities sector: accordingly, in 1963 he received his habilitation at Frankfurt. His dissertation was entitled (loosely translated), \\"The significance of the welfare state principle in family and company law\\" (\\"Der Sozialstaatgrundsatz in seiner Bedeutung fuer das Recht von Familie und Unternehmen\\"). Although the risks associated with unregulated accumulation by public bodies of vast quantities of personal data were already appearing on the horizon among academics familiar with developments in database technology, his habilitation was not concerned with Data Protection, the speciality which by the end of the 1960s had become the focus of his work. Around the time he submitted his dissertation Simitis met the Freudian psychoanalyst-scholar Ilse Grubrich at the home of their friend, the sociologist-philosopher J√ºrgen Habermas and his wife Ute. The wedding ceremony for Spiros and Ilse Simitis took place on 3 August 1963, following the Greek Orthodox rite which on this occasion, as one impressed academic colleague noted, involved \\"dancing around the bride and groom with floral wreaths\\". His next move was to the recently reinstated Law Faculty at the nearby University of Giessen, where between 1964 and 1969 he was employed as a full professor in Private law and Interjurisdictional Private law, along with Trade and Commercial law. Returning to Frankfurt in 1969, he took a professorship in Labour law, Civil law and Legal informatics, with a particular focus on Data Protection. Simitis is director of the Research Centre for Data Protection at Frankfurt University and is, or has been, a guest professor at the University of California, Berkeley (1976), Strasbourg University (1987-1988) and Yale University (1981-2000). Spiros Simitis authored the Data Protection Act for the state of Hessen which came into force in its original form on 13 October 1970 and is widely seen as the world's first statute on data protection.Alexander Genz: Datenschutz in Europa und den USA. Deutscher Universit√§ts-Verlag. Wiesbaden 2004. . p. 9. It was from the start, in his words, a \\"reaction to the constant refinement and evolution of Information Technology\\" (als \\"Reaktion auf eine sich st√§ndig weiterentwickelnde und verfeinernde Informationstechnologie\\"). In 1975 he took German citizenship, and this opened the way for him to take over as Chief Data Protection Commissioner for the state of Hessen in succession to Willi Birkelbach, although sources make clear that in reality his was the defining contribution from the establishment of the department in 1970. At the start of 1978 the West German government launched the Federal Commission for Data Protection (\\"Bundesbeauftragter f√ºr den Datenschutz\\" / BfD), a nationwide version of the Data Protection Commission that had operated in Hessen since the start of the decade, and closely modeled on it. As the man who had designed the Hessen Data Protection Commission, Spiros Simitis was seen as an obvious candidate to head up the national version of it. The job was indeed offered to him by Interior Minister Werner Maihofer. Simitis and Maihofer discussed plans for the new commission in some detail and agreed to an initial headcount of 32 for it. In November 1977 it emerged that Simitis had turned down the post, however, and cabinet minutes indicated that the government had agreed to a headcount level of only 20. Simitis had refused the job because proper resourcing for the national Data Protection Commission, as previously agreed, would not be forthcoming. The legislation for the creation of the national Data Protection Commissioner had specified that the identity of the country's first head of Data Protection would be determined by July 1977. With the post still unfilled in November 1977, commentators inferred a lack of commitment to data protection on the part of the government which the powerful IG Metall trades union saw as an \\"alarm signal for every citizen\\" (ein \\"Alarmsignal f√ºr alle B√ºrger\\"). At the eleventh hour Hans Peter Bull was appointed West Germany's first Federal Commissioner for Data Protection. He took on the office in an atmosphere of widespread continuing scepticism on the challenges involved in Information Technology legislation.  Memberships and commissions  Spiros Simitis has been a member of the German Council for International Private Law since 1966. Between 1966 and 1980 he was General Secretary of the International Data Commission (Generalsekret√§r der Internationalen Zivilstandskommission). In addition, between 1979 and 1982 he was a member of the standing deputation for Data Protection of the German Jurists Convention (Deutscher Juristentag), and between 1982 and 1986 he served as chair of the Council of Europe's Experts Commission on Data Protection questions. Since 1988 he has served as permanent advisor to the European Commission on Data Protection questions. He served between 1990 and 1996 on the research council of the European University Institute in Florence, in 1994 as advisor to the ILO on creating a system for regulating employee data protection, and between 1998 and 1999 as chair of the European Commission's High-level-expert-commission on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Between 1999 and 2001 he was a member of the strategy commission dealing with further development of the European University Institute (Florence) and in 2001, through a German cabinet resolution, he joined the National Ethics Council (\\"Nationaler Ethikrat\\"), chairing it till 2005. He served on it again between 2008 and 2012 (by which time the former \\"Nationaler Ethikrat\\" had been renamed as the \\"Deutscher Ethikrat\\").  Recognition and celebration  During his professional career Spiros Simitis has received a succession of honours from international commissions and academic institutions. He has been an honorary doctor of the Democritus University of Thrace since 1992, and also, since 2003, of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. He has been an honorary member of the German Jurists Convention (Deutscher Juristentag) since 2002 and a corresponding member of the Academy of Athens since 2003.

M. Abdul Jabbar (born June 26, 1939, Sathankulam, Tamil Nadu) is a Tamil radio broadcaster, cricket commentator, writer and actor. Early life S. M. Abdul Jabbar was born into a middle class Muslim family and grew up in the small town of Sathankulam, presently in Thoothukudi district in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. Having relatives in Sri Lanka, he relocated to Colombo for his higher studies at Zahira College, Colombo. After completing his education he moved back to India due to the tense political situation in Sri Lanka.  Radio and cricket commentary  Born in the Golden Age of Radio, Jabbar became a regular radio listener during his childhood in India and Sri Lanka. He often wrote letters to radio stations about their programs. On one occasion, he wrote a letter to All India Radio that was critical of its Tamil language cricket commentary. The letter was read on air, and he was invited to show his skill by providing Tamil commentary of the Ranji Trophy match between Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The opportunity changed his life. Abdul Jabbar already had considerable experience anchoring Tamil programs for the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation when he joined the AIR Chennai Tamil commentary team in 1979. He learned substantially from commentating with Tamil radio pioneer and cricket writer V Ramamurthy. The AIR Tamil commentary team covered every test match and one day international played in Chennai, and many of the regional matches. Jabbar's commentary remained popular through the 1990s, with a fan base in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka that included LTTE supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran, whom he interviewed in 2002. The AIR Tamil commentary team was disbanded in 2004, after which Abdul Jabbar continued providing Tamil commentary for the television channels ESPN, Neo Sports, Sun TV and Zee.

Name of the suits  Hearts (Herz)  Diamonds (Karo)  Spades (Pik)  Clubs (Kreuz, Treff) }  Description  Zwicken is a very common Austrian and German gambling game that is usually played for small stakes and makes a good party game. It is like a more intense version of the German game of Tippen ‚Äì the general rules and mode of play are much the same ‚Äì but there are significant differences, especially its permanent trump, the 7, and its 'hop and jump' (Hupf und Sprung) element, in which, like Kratzen and Austrian Lampeln, the role of dealer may 'hop' to the next player or 'jump' over one or more players as a result of the cut. As in all games of the Rams group, players may always drop out of a particular deal at the start. The main differences from Tippen are outlined below and are based on Katira, except where stated. * Permanent Trump. 7 / 7 is the permanent, 2nd-highest trump, ranking just below the Trump Ace / Sow. * Hop and Jump. Between shuffling and dealing, the player sitting to the right of the dealer (rearhand) cuts the cards and reveals the lowest card. If it is an Ace / Sow or Seven, the deal passes to the next player without playing, but the dealer's stake remains in the pool and the next dealer also pays 3 units. If it is the 7 / 7, the deal passes to the rearhand in clockwise order and both he and all the players in between pay the basic stake of 3 units. * Trump Ace. The player with the Trump Ace / Sow, must play it the first time he is leading to a trick.  Play  The aim is to win as many tricks as possible. After the dealer has been decided, taking account of any 'hop' or 'jump' as described above, he antes 3 chips to the pot and deals 2 cards to each player, turns the next for trumps and then deals a third card to each player. At this point, beginning with forehand, players may exchange up to 3 cards with the talon or announce that they will \\"pass\\" and drop out of the current deal. Forehand leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if possible, otherwise must trump and must head the trick if they can. The winner is the player with the most tricks.  Scoring  Players earn a third of the pot for each trick taken. In addition a player is gezwickt (i.e. has lost) and pays a basic stake if: * he plays and fails to take a trick * as the dealer, he fails to check the lowest card * he has the Trump Ace and does not lead it to a trick at the first opportunity * he has the 7 / 7 and loses it to the Trump Ace.  Anbieten, Freibieten and Sticheln  An historical variant of Zwicken was played in which only the last trick counted. This was variously known as Anbieten, Freibieten or Sticheln, and was banned, for example, in Upper Austria as in 1825 because it was \\"very similar to the forbidden card game of Zwicken and belongs to those games in which winning and losing depend more on the luck of the cards than on the skill of the player\\" and \\"because the stake could be increased time and again by the declarer\\" (Freibieter). This variant should not be confused with Sticheln, another Austrian game which resembles Whist.

Chart King was voted Greyhound of the Year after winning the 1999 Scottish Greyhound Derby and 1999 English Greyhound Derby. He also picked up the Irish Greyhound of the Year award. Chart King a brindle dog was owned and trained by brothers Karl and Ralph Hewitt from Lurgan in Northern Ireland. He also won the Easter Cup in a record breaking 28.40 at Shelbourne Park. Linda Mullins won the Greyhound Trainer of the Year for the fourth successive year. Sky Sports increased their TV coverage to show major events on Tuesday nights at Wimbledon including the Springbok and the Grand National, the latter now held at Wimbledon instead of Hall Green. They also wanted to show the Pall Mall Stakes at Oxford but the track was reluctant to switch the event to a Tuesday night so remained off the viewing schedule for the time being. Tracks Wisbech reopened under NGRC rules and appointed former Peterborough RM Mike Middle. The tracks owner Gary Meads had improved the facilities after the venue had been closed for seven years. Canterbury closed its doors on 30 October and independent Workington ceased racing. Peterborough was severely damaged by fire spread from an adjoining warehouse. Work started immediately on repairs and refurbishment but there was no racing for six months. The Dundalk Race Company PLC and Dundealgan Greyhound Racing Company Limited merged to form Dundalk Racing (1999) Ltd. The Dundalk Ramparts Greyhound Stadium was earmarked for a major rebuild. News Elsewhere the BS Group (owners of several tracks) purchased the Milton Keynes Bowl to add to their assets. Shelley Cobbold sent out the last runner from the Utopia kennels at Nottingham, the family association with greyhound racing (Joe Cobbold, the late Trevor Cobbold and Pam Cobbold) ended. In November Linda Jones gained a contract at the country's premier track Walthamstow. Competitions El Tenor dropped back down in distance in an attempt to defend his Grand National title and made the final but was unlucky to find trouble when going well. The race ended in a dead heat for Hello Buttons and Pottos Storm. Despite this defeat the target of 100 open race wins was in sight even though he had gone past five years of age. By the end of the year he was still competing and winning. A puppy by the name of Rapid Ranger had started his career with defeat in two graded races at Stainforth for trainer Mike Pomfrett, but was improving and scored a first open win at Nottingham. By autumn he would improve and owner Ray White purchased the brindle and sent him to Charlie Lister. A brindle dog called Palace Issue, trained by Linda Mullins started to perform superbly and quickly established himself as the leading stayer. He broke the track record at Romford during the Champion Stakes before winning the Group One Grand Prix at Walthamstow that included his rival Dilemmas Lad. A strong fancy for the first St Leger at Wimbledon, he had to settle for second behind Dilemmas Lad before successfully defending his Hunt Cup title at Reading. Gerald Watson travelled to England with his 1999 Irish Greyhound Derby champion Spring Time and outclassed her rivals when winning the Oaks at Wimbledon and Bubbly Prince won the Cesarewitch at Catford Stadium for the Bubbly Club making up for the previous year's disappointment.

In Poker, the term refers to a community card which is extremely unlikely to help any remaining player. The names of the non-counters varies from region to region and game to game. In Poker, they are blanks, bricks or bombs. In the German games of Schafkopf, Doppelkopf, Sixty- six and Skat, the 7s, 8s and 9s in all card suits are Luschen.Skatbegriffe at www.euroskat.com. Retrieved 18 Jul 18Schafkopf Glossar at www.schafkopf- palast.de. Retrieved 18 Jul 18 In the popular Swiss game of Jass the Luschen are the 6s, 7s, 8s and 9s; unlike Skat, however, the 9 of trumps, \\"Nell\\", is worth 14 points and is thus an exception; it ranks in the hierarchy immediately below the highest trump card, the Jack or Unter of Trumps (20 points) and above the Ace of Trumps (11 points). In most versions of Schafkopf, the 6s are also blanks. There are no blanks in games like Whist or Bridge, because they are plain-trick games where it is the number of tricks that counts, not the value of the cards won. Similar nicknames are given to very low-scoring cards. For example, in Tarock games, tarocks and pip cards score 1/3 of a point and are called GlatzenKastner and Folkvord (2005), p. 223/224 or Glatz'n,Mayr and Sedlaczek (2015), p. 405 Skartindeln, Skatindeln or Skartins;Bamberger (2011), p. 95 and suit cards other than court cards are also called Ladons, Latons or Ladonis. Dummett calls them collectively low cards.Dummett (1980), p. 245 In French Tarot they are the cartes basses. Low- value poker cards may be called rags. In the Brusbart family of games, although cards do not have point values, certain cards are worthless in the sense that they cannot beat anything, even lower cards of the same suit. In Bruus and other members of the family they are 'duds' (Luschen or Fosen) or 'worthless cards' (wertlose Karten), but in Brus they are called 'windmills'. In Br√§us, they are literally unplayable and only serve to pad out the hand.  References   Bibliography  * Bamberger, Johannes (2011). Tarock: Die sch√∂nsten Varianten. 22nd edition.

Palace Issue trained by Linda Mullins was voted Greyhound of the Year after winning the St Leger at Wimbledon Stadium, defending his Grand Prix title at Walthamstow, winning a third successive Hunt Cup and second WJ & JE Cearns Invitation. Mullins also won the Greyhound Trainer of the Year for the fifth successive year and then announced her retirement, the kennels and licence was switched to one of her sons John. El Tenor owned by Mario Lanfranchi and trained by Mullins brought up the magical 100 open race wins to write his name in the history books as one of the greatest hurdlers. Rising star Rapid Ranger was third in the Scottish Greyhound Derby behind Knockeevan Star and then went on to win the 2000 English Greyhound Derby. Tracks Irish tracks were subject to changes. The Dundalk Ramparts Greyhound Stadium closed on 20 November in order for the major rebuild to take place. Curraheen Park opened on 8 April as a replacement for the previous track the Cork (Western Road) Greyhound Stadium, the sale of the old track enabled the Irish Greyhound Board to fund a new stadium with modern facilities. The Kingdom Greyhound Stadium in Tralee also underwent a major refit as the stadium was redesigned for the new Millennium. Swaffham ceased to race after the promoter Tom Smith and the holder of the lease Vince Moody had a disagreement, the track had raced for 13 years and was turned into a schooling facility. Tom Smith and son Gavin Smith would leave a lasting legacy however as they were responsible for producing the 'Swaffham hare'. During a ten year period they had produced a hare system that would replace just about every other hare system; the McGee, outside Sumner, inside Sumner and Bramich would all but disappear. News The Supertrack competition inaugurated in 1994 is officially ended by the British Greyhound Racing Board. Harlow lost three trainers in quick succession; Jean Carter moved to Crayford, Wayne Wilson to Catford and Kay Wyatt to Sittingbourne. Wyatt would soon give up training and Maxine Locke would take over the kennels and contract at Sittingbourne. Hazel Dickson retired leaving Wimbledon for other interests outside of greyhound racing; she had never recovered from the day that Wembley closed. Nick Savva won the trainers championship and trained 93 British Bred winners in one year, only Trevor Cobbold in 1994 had produced a more. Catford Racing Manager Phil Donaldson left for a career in journalism with the Racing Post with his assistant Derek Hope taking over. Crayford also lost their Racing Manager after Paul Lawrence left to be replaced by deputy Harry Bull with Danny Rayment promoted to deputy.

It is a measure of one's capacity to \\"make decisions and act according to its own logic,\\" and distinguishes independent media from state media. The concept of media independence has often been contested as a normative principle in media policy and journalism. Nick Couldry (2009) considers that digital transformations tend to compromise the press as a common good (with a blurring of the difference between journalism and advertising, for example) by the technological, political and social dynamics that it brings. For this reason, authors such as Daniel Hallin,Hallin, Daniel C. 2006. ‚ÄúThe Passing of the ‚ÄòHigh Modernism‚Äô of American Journalism Revisited.‚Äù Political Communication Report 16 (1). Kelly McBride, and Tom RosenstielMcBride, Kelly, and Tom Rosenstiel. 2013. ‚ÄúIntroduction: New Guiding Principles for a New Era of Journalism.‚Äù In The New Ethics of Journalism. Principles for the 21st Century, edited by KellyMcBride and Tom Rosenstiel, 1‚Äì6. London: Sage consider other norms (such as transparency and participation) to be more relevant. Karppinen and Moe state that \\"what we talk about when we talk about media independence, then, are the characteristics of the relations between, on the one side, specific entities ranging from media institutions, via journalistic cultures, to individual speakers, and, on the other, their social environment, including the state, political interest groups, the market or the mainstream culture.\\"  Overview  Two factors tend to influence media independence. The disruption and crisis in business models that have supported print and broadcast media for decades have left traditional media outlets more vulnerable to external influences as they seek to establish new revenue sources. In many regions, austerity measures have led to large-scale budget cuts of public service broadcasters, dislocating employees and limiting innovation in programming. An indicator of a lack of independence is the level of public trust in the credibility of journalism. According to the Edelman Trust Barometer, trust in media seems to be declining, reflecting declines of trust in government, business and NGOs.Edelman. 2017. Trust Barometer. Edelman. Available at https://www.edelman.com/trust2017/. Accessed 11 June 2017. Since 2012, online media has become more and more popular, gaining trust throughout the world, but for Mindi Chahal, awareness on the risk of \\"fake- news\\", filter bubbles and algorithms has begun to change perceptions of the credibility of online information.Chahal, Mindi. 2017. The fake news effect and what it means for advertisers. Marketing Week. Available at https://www.marketingweek.com/2017/03/27/the-fake-news-effect/. Accessed 25 May 2017. Anya Schiffrin says that despite the initial optimism that social media would reduce such tendencies by enabling broader citizen participation in media, there are growing signals that social media are similarly susceptible to political capture and polarization, further impacting on the trust that users may have towards information on these platforms.Schriffen, Anya. 2017b. In the Service of Power: Media Capture and the Threat to Democracy. Washington, DC: Center for International Media Assistance. Available at https://www.cima.ned.org/resource/service-power-media-capture- threat-democracy/ Media regulators impact on the editorial independence of the media, which is still deeply entwined with political and economic influences and pressures. Private media - functioning outside of governments' control and with minimum official regulation - are still dependent on advertising support, risking potential misuse of advertisers as a political tool by larger advertisers such as governments. New technologies has added new meaning to what constitutes media independence. The collection, selection, aggregation, synthesis and processing of data are now increasingly delegated to forms of automation. While the sharing of social media posts is crucial in elevating the importance of certain news sources or stories, what appears in individual news feeds on platforms such as Facebook or news aggregators such as Google News is the product of other forces as well. This includes algorithmic calculations, which remove professional editorial judgement, in favor of past consumption patterns by the individual user and his/her social network. In 2016, users declared preferring algorithms over editors for selecting the news they wanted to read.Levy, David, Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, Nic Newman, and Richard Fletcher. 2016.

Regulation  The role of regulatory authorities (license broadcaster institutions, content providers, platforms) and the resistance to political and commercial interference in the autonomy of the media sector are both considered as significant components of media independence. In order to ensure media independence, regulatory authorities should be placed outside of governments' directives. this can be measured through legislation, agency statutes and rules.  Government regulations  = Licensing = The process of issuing licenses in many regions still lacks transparency and is considered to follow procedures that are obscure and concealing. In many countries, regulatory authorities stand accused of political bias in favor of the government and ruling party, whereby some prospective broadcasters have been denied licenses or threatened with the withdrawal of licenses. In many countries, diversity of content and views have diminished as monopolies, fostered directly or indirectly by States. This not only impacts on competition but leads to a concentration of power with potentially excessive influence on public opinion.Hanretty, Chris. 2014. Media outlets and their moguls: Why concentrated individual or family ownership is bad for editorial independence. European Journal of Communication 29 (3): 335‚Äì350. Buckley et al. cite failure to renew or retain licenses for editorially critical media; folding the regulator into government ministries or reducing its competences and mandates for action; and lack of due process in the adoption of regulatory decisions, among others, as examples in which these regulators are formally compliant with sets of legal requirements on independence, but their main task in reality is seen to be that of enforcing political agendas.Buckley, Steve, Kreszentia Duer, Toby Mendel, and Sean O. Siochru. 2008. Broadcasting, Voice, and Accountability : A Public Interest Approach to Policy, Law, and Regulation. Washington, DC: World Bank. = Government endorsed appointments = State control is also evident in the increasing politicization of regulatory bodies operationalized through transfers and appointments of party- aligned individuals to senior positions in regulatory authorities. = Internet regulation = Governments worldwide have sought to extend regulation to internet companies, whether connectivity providers or application service providers, and whether domestically or foreign-based. The impact on journalistic content can be severe, as internet companies can err too much on the side of caution and take down news reports, including algorithmically, while offering inadequate opportunities for redress to the affected news producers.  Self-regulation  = Regional = In Western Europe, self-regulation provides an alternative to state regulatory authorities. In such contexts, newspapers have historically been free of licensing and regulation, and there has been repeated pressure for them to self-regulate or at least to have in-house ombudsmen. However, it has often been difficult to establish meaningful self-regulatory entities. In many cases, self-regulations exists in the shadow of state regulation, and is conscious of the possibility of state intervention. In many countries in Central and Eastern Europe, self-regulatory structures seems to be lacking or have not historically been perceived as efficient and effective.Fengler, Susanne, Tobias Eberwein, Salvador Alsius, Olivier Baisn√©e, Klaus Bichler, Boguslawa Dobek-Ostrowska, Huub Evers, et al. 2015. How effective is media self-regulation? Results from a comparative survey of European journalists. European Journal of Communication 30 (3): 249‚Äì266. The rise of satellite delivered channels, delivered directly to viewers, or through cable or online systems, renders much larger the sphere of unregulated programing. There are, however, varying efforts to regulate the access of programmers to satellite transponders in parts of the Western Europe and North American region, the Arab region and in Asia and the Pacific. The Arab Satellite Broadcasting Charter was an example of efforts to bring formal standards and some regulatory authority to bear on what is transmitted, but it appears to not have been implemented.UNESCO. 2014. World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development. Paris: UNESCO Available at https://en.unesco.org/world- media-trends-2017/previous-editions = International organizations and NGO's = Self-regulation is expressed as a preferential system by journalists but also as a support for media freedom and development organizations by intergovernmental organizations such as UNESCO and non-governmental organizations. There has been a continued trend of establishing self- regulatory bodies, such as press councils, in conflict and post-conflict situations. Major internet companies have responded to pressure by governments and the public by elaborating self-regulatory and complaints systems at the individual company level, using principles they have developed under the framework of the Global Network Initiative. The Global Network Initiative has grown to include several large telecom companies alongside internet companies such as Google, Facebook and others, as well as civil society organizations and academics.Global Network Initiative (GNI). 2017. Global Network Initiative Adds Seven Companies in Milestone Expansion of Freedom of Expression and Privacy Initiative. Available at https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/global- network-initiative-adds-seven-companies-in-milestone-expansion-of-freedom-of- expression-and-privacy-initiative/. The European Commission‚Äôs 2013 publication, ICT Technology Sector Guide on Implementing the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, impacts on the presence of independent journalism by defining the limits of what should or should not be carried and prioritized in the most popular digital spaces.European Commission. Shift and Institute for Human Rights and Business, 2013. https://www.ihrb.org/pdf/eu-sector-guidance/EC-Guides/ICT/EC-Guide_ICT.pdf = Private sector = Ranking Digital Rights indicator scores for policy transparency in regards to third-party requests for content or account restriction Public pressure on technology giants has motivated the development of new strategies aimed not only at identifying ‚Äòfake news‚Äô, but also at eliminating some of the structural causes of their emergence and proliferation. Facebook has created new buttons for users to report content they believe is false, following previous strategies aimed at countering hate speech and harassment online. These changes reflect broader transformations occurring among tech giants to increase their transparency. As indicated by the Ranking Digital Rights Corporate Accountability Index, most large internet companies have reportedly become relatively more forthcoming in terms of their policies about transparency in regard to third party requests to remove or access content, especially in the case of requests from governments.Ranking Digital Rights. 2015. Corporate Accountability Index. Available at https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2015/. Ranking Digital Rights. 2017. Corporate Accountability Index. Available at https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2017/. At the same time, however, the study signaled a number of companies that have become more opaque when it comes to disclosing how they enforce their own terms of service, in restricting certain types of content and account.Ranking Digital Rights. 2017. Corporate Accountability Index. Available at https://rankingdigitalrights.org/index2017/. = Fact-checking and news literacy = Ranking Digital Rights indicator scores for policy transparency in regard to their terms of service enforcement (which impact upon content or account restrictions) In addition to responding to pressure for more clearly defined self-regulatory mechanisms, and galvanized by the debates over so- called ‚Äòfake news‚Äô, internet companies such as Facebook have launched campaigns to educate users about how to more easily distinguish between ‚Äòfake news‚Äô and real news sources. Ahead of the United Kingdom national election in 2017, for example, Facebook published a series of advertisements in newspapers with ‚ÄòTips for Spotting False News‚Äô which suggested 10 things that might signal whether a story is genuine or not. There have also been broader initiatives bringing together a variety of donors and actors to promote fact- checking and news literacy, such as the News Integrity Initiative at the City University of New York‚Äôs School of Journalism. This 14 million USD investment by groups including the Ford Foundation and Facebook was launched in 2017 so its full impact remains to be seen. It will, however, complement the offerings of other networks such as the International Fact-Checking Network launched by the Poynter Institute in 2015 which seeks to outline the parameters of the field.  Influences in media systems  The media systems around the world are often put under pressure by the widespread delegitimisation by political actors of the media as a venerable institution along with the profession of journalism, and the growing efforts made towards media capture, particularly online media, which has often been regarded as more resistant to such form of control than other types of media.  Delegitimisation of models  Effect of deligitimisation of media on society = Discreditation = Powerful actors such as governments have often been seen to initiate and engage in the process of systematic attacks on the media by trivializing it, or sometimes characterizing it as an ‚Äòenemy‚Äô has widespread implications for the independence and well-being of the sector. This can be particularly apparent during elections. A common tactic is to blur the distinction between mainstream news media, and the mass of unverified content on social media. Delegitimisation is a subtle and effective form of propaganda, reducing the public's confidence in the media to perform a collective function as a check on government. This can be seen as being linked political and social polarization. = Attacks on media = In some regions, delegitimisation is reportedly combined with wider attacks on independent media: key properties have been closed down or sold to parties with ties to the government. Newer entrants linked to state power and vast resources gain sway. Opposition to these pressures may strengthen the defense of the press as civil society and mobilize the public in protest, but in some cases, this conflict leads to fear-induced apathy or withdrawal. Advertisers and investors may be scared-off by delegitimisation. = Criminal defamation = Efforts to curtail criminal defamation are still ongoing in many regions but the dangers from civil lawsuits with high costs and high risk are also rising, leading to a greater likelihood of bankruptcy of media outlets. Independence is weakened where the right of journalists to criticize public officials is threatened. A general assault on the media can lead to measures making journalists more frequently liable for publishing state secrets and their capacity to shield sources can be reduced. Delegitimizing the media makes it easier to justify these legal changes that make the news business even more precarious.  Media capture  Media capture refers to the full range of forces that can restrict or skew coverage. It has been defined as \\"a situation where the media have not succeeded in becoming autonomous in manifesting a will of their own, nor able to perform their main function, notably of informing people. Instead, they have persisted in an intermediate state, with vested interests, and not just the government, using them for other purposes.\\" Mungiu-Pippidi considers that capture corrupts the main role of the media: to inform the public, with media outlets instead opting to trade influence and manipulate information.Mungiu- Pippidi, Alina. 2013. Freedom without Impartiality: The Vicious Circle of Media Capture. In Media Transformations in the Post-Communist World, edited by Peter Gross and Karol Jakubowicz. Plymouth: Lexington Books. A distinguishing feature of media capture is the collaboration by the private sector. Cases abound across all regions of bloggers and citizen journalists putting a spotlight on specific issues and reporting on the ground during protests.Allan, Stuart, and Einar Thorsen, eds. 2009. Citizen Journalism: Global Perspectives. Vol. 1. 2 vols. Global Crises and the Media. Peter Lang. Allan, Stuart. 2013. Citizen Witnessing: Revisioning Journalism in Times of Crisis. Key Concepts in Journalism Series. Polity. H√§nska-Ahy, Maximillian T., and Roxanna Shapour. 2013. Who‚Äôs Reporting the Protests?

Participatory Politics and Citizen Journalism in a Networked Africa: A Connected Continent. Palgrave Macmillan UK. Full capture can also be complicated to achieve. Paid trolls leading to phenomena such as paid Twitter and mob attacks, along with fake news and rumors, are reportedly able to widely disseminate their attacks on independent journalists with the aid of bots. Across much of Africa, a trend of \\"serial callers\\" has become increasingly common. Also observed in other regions, such as in North America where the phenomenon is commonly referred to as \\"astroturfing\\", serial callers are often individuals commissioned by political actors to constantly phone in to popular radio call in programmes with the intention of skewing or influencing the program in their interest. In some cases, the programme might be structurally biased towards such actors (e.g., there will be a dedicated phone for those that have planned to phone in with particular political sympathies) but in other cases the process is more ad hoc with sympathetic callers flooding particular radio programs.  Financial regulations and business models  = Concentration of media ownership = Financial threats on media independence can be concentrated ownership power, bankruptcy, or unsustainable funding for public service broadcasters. Capital controls for media are in place in all regions to manage foreign direct investment in the media sector. Many governments in Africa, Latin America and Caribbean, and the Asia and Pacific regions have passed stringent laws and regulations that limit or forbid foreign media ownership, especially in the broadcasting and telecom sectors, with mixed impact on editorial independence. In Latin America, almost two thirds of the 15 countries covered by a World Bank study on foreign direct investments impose restrictions on foreign ownership in the newspaper- publishing sector. Almost all countries specify a cap on the foreign investment in media sector, although increasingly the strategy in the region has been to absorb private and foreign capital and experience of media management without losing ownership and political control of the media sector.The World Bank, International Finance Corporation (IFC), and Development Bank of Latin America (CAF) 2013. It is more complex to regulate ownership issues when the companies are internet platforms spanning multiple jurisdictions, although European competition and tax law has responded to some of the challenges in this regard, with unclear impact on the issue of independence of journalistic content on Internet companies. = New business models = Across the industry, media outlets have been re-evaluating where the value in media content lies, with a corresponding increase in government development programs, corporate benefactors and other special interests funding or cross-funding media content. These kinds of funding have been common historically in international broadcasting, and they typically influence actual media content, framing, and the ‚Äòred lines‚Äô different from professional principles that reporters feel unable to cross. While larger media companies have relied on attracting their own advertisers online, many online intermediaries such as Google Ads now exist, which effectively has meant that small online media companies can get some revenues without having to have dedicated facilities‚Äîalthough the requirements of platforms like Facebook for video content, and the power to change news feeds without consultation do compromise editorial autonomy. In addition, the media organization concerned can no longer exert strong control over what advertisements are shown, nor can it benefit from accessing full audience data to strengthen its own revenue prospects.  Journalist perceptions  Trends in journalists perception of the credibility of journalism According to the Worlds of Journalism Study, journalists in 18 of the 21 countries surveyed in Western Europe and North America perceived their freedom to make editorial decisions independently to have shrunken in the past five years. In all other regions, a plurality of journalists in most countries reported their editorial freedom to have strengthened.Worlds of Journalism Study 2016. The Worlds of Journalism Study is an academically driven project that was founded to regularly assess the state of journalism throughout the world. Its most recent wave brought together researchers from 67 countries, who interviewed 27,500 journalists between 2012 and 2016. While there remains a marked decline in print advertising sales in these States, some newspapers are reporting an increase in digital advertising revenues and subscriptions that have enabled expansions of newsrooms that previously faced significant financial difficulty. This development partly reflects the relationship between major news brands and electoral cycles but it may also signal a growing willingness on the part of readers to pay for quality digital content.Chatterjee, Lahiri. 2017.

Accessed 8 June 2017  Mitigating political and economic interference  Several tools and organizations commit to mitigate political and economic interference in the media system. = Regulatory bodies = In some countries, the rise of trade bodies as a dominating site of advocacy seems to limit the plurality of voices involved or consulted to those representing mainly owner interests in decision-making. This has occurred as the lobbying power of media elites has increased with ownership consolidation, particularly in North America. In some cases, the relative formal independence of the media regulator from government may have made it more vulnerable to capture by commercial interests. Some of the board members from these trade bodies and associations sit on government working groups and are members of committees. Such members often facilitate the associations‚Äô indirect participation in the drafting of media laws and policy. = Professionalization of regulatory bodies = According to the World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018, there is a strong societal demand for the professionalization of regulatory and media bodies: * Governmental alliances such as the Freedom Online Coalition and NGOs such as IFEX and the Media Legal Defence Initiative * Training of lawyers and judges are gaining popularity. UNESCO has provided training in this vein to 5,000 employees of the judicial sector in Latin America, and is commencing a similar initiative in Africa. * There is also an increase in online training for journalism. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and increased internet access in all regions of the world: There are a number of distance learning programs based in the United States and United Kingdom, such as the Knight Centre for Journalism in the Americas, which also offers courses in Spanish serving countries in Latin America. The BBC Academy is another prominent example. The University of South Africa offers online degrees and short courses, including in media, to a global audience. *Technology companies are demonstrating a growing interest in these activities, particularly as they attempt to influence policy at a domestic level. Google, Facebook, and others have recently established policy offices also in Africa and the Arab region with a mandate to support the development of conducive policies and legal frameworks, as well as informed lawyers and policymakers, for their products. = Journalistic standards = *Codes of ethics are a common way to promote journalistic standards. While there have been a number of codes of ethics for journalists that aspire to universal status, and even some for ‚Äòonline journalists‚Äô and bloggers, most transnational news agencies and broadcasters adhere to their own codes, although not all are publicly available. * In most regions, newspapers have developed their own codes of conduct with consistent values and standards that publishers and journalists should observe. Some newspapers have also appointed an ombudsman or readers‚Äô representative to handle complaints from the public. * In many countries, press councils and associations function like trade unions for journalists seeking to improve working conditions and to remove barriers journalists face when gathering news. * Depending on the country, independent press councils are formed on a non-statutory basis and in some cases, they are mandated by law. = Donor priorities = Donors priorities in media development, UNESCO Donor support of media development and freedom of expression non-governmental organizations can vary widely. A report by the National Endowment for Democracy‚Äôs Center for International Media Assistance (CIMA) highlighted the swings in funding by tracking United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funding to different regions over the past three years.Kalathil, Shanthi. 2017. A Slowly Shifting Field: Understanding Donor Priorities in Media Development. CIMA Digital Report. Center for International Media Assistance (CIMA). Available at https://www.cima.ned.org/publication/slowly-shifting-field/. Private foundations based in the Global North are increasingly providing grants to media organizations in the Global South. Such funds are often directed to cover specific topics of interest, such as health or education, and these donations can either support or weaken editorial independence.Schiffrin, Anya. 2017a. Same Beds, Different Dreams? Charitable Foundations and Newsroom Independence in the Global South. Center for International Media Assistance (CIMA) & National Endowment for Democracy. Available at https://www.cima.ned.org/resource/beds-different-dreams-charitable- foundations-newsroom-independence-global-south/.  Gender equality   The media workplace  In the newsroom, women sometimes face hostility. This can be partly explained by the lack of organizational policies relating to gender equality and reporting mechanisms for harassment. The International Women‚Äôs Media Foundation‚Äôs 2011 global study of women in the news media, found that more than half of the news media organizations surveyed had a company-wide policy on gender equality, but with significant variations between regions. More than two-thirds of organizations based in Western Europe and Africa had such policies, compared with a quarter in the Middle East and North Africa and less than 20 per cent in Central and Eastern European countries.Byerly, Carolyn M. 2011. Global Report on Status of Women in News Media. Washington D. C.: International Women‚Äôs Media Foundation (IWMF). Available at https://www.iwmf.org/resources/global-report-on-the-status-of-women-in-the- news-media/. Accessed 8 June 2017. The European Institute for Gender Equality‚Äôs 2013 report, which looked at 99 major media houses across Europe, found that a quarter of organizations had policies that included a provision for gender equality, often as part of broader equality directives in the society. It was notable that of the 99 organizations, public service bodies were much more likely than commercial ones to have equality policies in place.  Media monitoring and advocacy  = Regional organizations = Several regional gender monitoring initiatives exist. The South Africa-based Gender Links, formed in 2001 to promote \\"gender equality in and through the media\\" in Southern Africa, leads the media cluster of the Southern Africa Gender Protocol Alliance. Gender Links promotes media advocacy through global initiatives such as the Global Alliance on Media and Gender (GAMAG), hosting gender and media summits, developing policy in collaboration with regulators and working with media organizations through training and policy development. Gender Links is currently developing Centres of Excellence for Gender in the Media in 108 newsrooms across Southern Africa and has established eight Centres of Excellence for Gender in Media Education. In 2016, the World Association for Christian Communication (WACC), the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) Network and other partners launched a campaign to end news media sexism by 2020. The ‚ÄòEnd News Media Sexism‚Äô campaign encourages and supports advocacy initiatives that promote changes in media policies and journalism practice. The campaign is taking a multi-disciplinary approach and uses a variety of different tools to promote awareness, including a gender scorecard against which media organizations are measured. The African Women's Development and Communication Network (FEMNET), founded in 1988 as part of a broader project to promote women's empowerment in Africa, prioritizes women's development in the field of communication, where they have created and managed platforms to share information, ideas, strategies and experiences to foster cross-learning and more effective implementation of shared goals. FEMNET provides strategic policy recommendations through the production of reports and policy briefs. It has led extensive local capacity building initiatives, such as facilitating women's access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) in Africa. In Asia, the South Asia Women's Network (SWAN) has rolled out a research project titled \\"Women for Change: Building a Gendered Media in South Asia\\". Covering nine South Asian countries, it is partly supported by UNESCO's International Programme for the Development of Communication. = National organizations = A number of national organizations work locally to redress the disparity in women's representation and participation in the media. Women, Media and Development (known by its Arabic acronym TAM) is a Palestine-based organization founded in 2004. TAM works with local women to promote their increased representation in the media and to foster an environment where they are able to effectively communicate and advocate for their rights. TAM provides training for women on how to access and use various media platforms, in addition to promoting community awareness and advocacy initiatives. TAM has facilitated capacity building and worked to counter stereotypes of women in the media by producing gender sensitive guides and training manuals, in addition to implementing projects that aim to increase women's access to decision-making positions and civic participation.  Professional associations  Formal and informal networks of women media professionals support women in media. The Alliance for Women in Media (AWM), established in 1951 participate in training and professional development and celebrate their talents. In 1975, it began its annual programme of awards to recognize the work of programme-makers and content- providers in promoting women and women's issues. Marie Colvin Journalists' Network - a bilingual Arabic-English online community of women journalists working in the Arab world - aims to assist vulnerable women journalist who lack support in relation to safety training, legal contracts, insurance or psychological care. The network links experienced journalists with new or isolated journalists for mentoring and peer-to-peer support, while also working closely with experts in media law, digital security, and health and safety to ensure specialized advice and assistance.n.d. Marie Colvin Journalists‚Äô Network. Marie Colvin Journalists‚Äô Network. Available at https://mariecolvinnetwork.org/en/. Media unions at local, regional and global levels have established caucuses for women and have campaigned to encourage more women to stand for elected office within formal union structures. In 2001, the International Federation of Journalists found that women represented 29 per cent of union membership in 38 countries but just 17 per cent of members on union governing bodies: in its 2010 report, it found that women's representation on boards had increased only slightly, to 15 per cent. In Europe, between 2006 and 2013, women's union membership went down from 45 per cent to 42 per cent and board membership also declined, from 39 per cent to 36 per cent.

As an educational charity, it facilitates visits to BOTs for mainland British students, and has also pledged to alleviate certain financial constraints faced in the UK by students from the BOTs themselves. Such efforts are supported by regular fundraising activities, as well as through the backing of several prominent British politicians. Founded in Leeds by sole Chief Executive, Philip Smith, in 2013, FOTBOT has since been consulted by various national media organisations on articles regarding British relations with its dependencies. At least two university associations have been founded in assistance of the organisation's objectives.  Foundation and development  The organisation was founded in 2013 by Philip Smith, predominantly as a vehicle to foster ties between the young people of the United Kingdom and the sparsely located British Overseas Territories (BOTs), a group of 16 dependencies under the ultimate sovereignty and jurisdiction of the UK, having been former colonies of the British Empire. Its headquarters are currently based in Leeds, a city in Yorkshire. Its unofficial flag, reminiscent of that of many BOTs and depicted only on membership badges, was the result of an internal design competition and is registered with the Flags of the World association. Though falling outside of its stated charitable aims, FOTBOT is regularly consulted by media organisations regarding political developments in the BOTs. Instances have included an article published by The i, in which the charity expressed its disappointment that BOTs, excluding Gibraltar, would be unable to vote in the 2016 European Union membership referendum; more emotively, FOTBOT were quoted in The Times as considering the British Government's 2018 motion to demand that the British Virgin Islands publicly declare the owners of its businesses as \\"bring[ing] in the feeling of a colonial master again\\". Several politicians have declared their support for the organisation, including Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) Andrew Rosindell, former Secretary of State for International Development, Priti Patel, and Julia Reid, a UK Independence Party (UKIP) Member of the European Parliament (MEP). Historically, at least two student unions, at the universities of Cambridge and Newcastle respectively, have been affiliated with membership societies seeking to further the objectives of FOTBOT.  Activities  Established foremostly as a youth organisation, FOTBOT have oriented much of their activities toward educating young people, a motivation that has facilitated short excursions for British students to BOTs, as well as for students from the BOTs themselves to visit other dependencies and study in the UK without undue financial burden. In this vein, FOTBOT was partnered in a project headed by geographer Stewart McPherson, 'Treasure Islands', which \\"aim[ed] to showcase the wildlife, cultures and history of all of the UK Overseas Territories\\" by dispersing educative materials across the UK. As an organisation, FOTBOT host regular ticketed events that range from formal functions to round-table discussions surrounding the cultural and political situation of the BOTs; past committees have explored the possibility of BOT representation in the UK Parliament, as well as the challenges of day-to-day governance in British protectorates.

Rapid Ranger trained by Charlie Lister was voted Greyhound of the Year after winning his second English Greyhound Derby. The brindle dog joined an elite band of three greyhounds to win the Derby twice.Only Mick the Miller and Patricias Hope had previously achieved the feat. Linda Jones won the Greyhound Trainer of the Year but it was fellow trainer John McGee Sr. that once again hit the headlines, with a controversy regarding the trainer's championship to be held at Hove. McGee qualified for the top six Trainers' Championship by virtue of finishing fifth in the 2000 standings but was upset at the fact that John Mullins was allowed to take the place of his mother Linda Mullins. John Mullins had taken control of the kennels following Linda's retirement but an angry John McGee stated \\"I read that it was an unanimous decision\\" referring to the announcement made by the Professional Greyhound Trainers' Association (PGTA), \\"but unanimous by who? \\"They should have asked the five other trainers who have qualified what they thought, not just changed the rules because they wanted John Mullins in.\\" The anger was brought on by the fact that he had been denied an invitation to run in the 1988 championship after taking over the kennel from Fred Wiseman, who led the 1987 standings. \\"I was head man to Fred Wiseman, but everyone knew I was doing the dogs and we won everything that year\\". The Championship went ahead and was won by Charlie Lister but the controversy surrounding McGee continued, when later in the year he had a positive urine sample taken from Apple Rambler at Wimbledon. The NGRC once again withdrew his licence and he was told that no further application would be considered until January 2003. Tracks Advanced plans by the Greyhound Racing Association to open a 2,000 seater stadium at Fazakerley in the north of Liverpool failed to materialise following opposition from residents. Liverpool had lost greyhound racing in 1973 despite having four prominent profitable tracks at one stage. Castleford Whitwood Stadium held its final meeting in February; it had existed in spells as a licensed and independent track since 1938. News Trainer Graham Holland left Oxford to join Hove and was replaced by Nick Colton. Carly Philpott took out her first licence following in the footsteps of her father Paul Philpott and Maxine Locke joined Catford. Leading owner Len Ponder moved all of his greyhounds from trainer Ray Peacock and transferred them to Seamus Cahill. Owen McKenna son of Ger McKenna decided to return to Ireland to train mainly for David Miles (responsible for the Reactabond prefix) in Ballyclerihan. Despite having a contract at Wimbledon, McKenna had expressed concerns over lack of races and poor prize money. Competitions The Nick Savva trained Sonic Flight won a strong Scottish Greyhound Derby, a competition that saw the shock disqualification in the first round of prolific open race winner El Boss, who was subsequently retired. Sonic Flight also won the Select Stakes and Irish Laurels. The veteran Palace Issue now trained by John Mullins retired after failing to win the Golden Jacket but winning 69 of his 111 races and picking up ¬£65,000 in prize money. No Can Waltz enjoyed a good year, the Linda Jones trained white and brindle had finished second in the Arc final and third in the Scottish Derby and won the Test before a good Grand Prix campaign at Walthamstow Stadium came to an end losing to Slick Tom. He finished the year by reaching the St Leger final, he was arguably the best stayer ahead of Solid Magic who claimed the first Cesarewitch to be held at Oxford and the Olympic title. Ireland 2001 was a vintage year for stars, in the United Kingdom Rapid Ranger had dominated the news and Sonic Flight had a great year. In Ireland Cool Performance won the Derby but he was overshadowed by two of the finalists, Late Late Show and Droopys Kewell. Late Late Show owned by Pat Kenny and duly named after the popular show The Late Late Show became the nation's favourite greyhound. The black dog won the Easter Cup and Shelbourne 600, in addition to finishing runner-up in the Derby and being a finalist in the Champion Stakes. Droopys Kewell won three major events; the National Produce, St Leger and Champion Stakes. In any other year Droopys Kewell would have been Irish Greyhound of the Year but the accolade went to Late Late Show.

Droopys Rhys trained by Ted Soppitt was voted Greyhound of the Year. The blue dog had finished third in the Scottish Greyhound Derby behind Priceless Rebel before travelling to Ireland and staying with Reggie Roberts when finishing runner up in the Irish Greyhound Derby behind Bypass Byway. He had missed the English Derby before winning the Steel City Cup and Select Stakes. It had transpired that during that Irish Derby final Droopys Rhys had sustained a fracture on the hock and was later retired. Linda Jones was voted Greyhound Trainer of the Year for the second successive year. An opportunity was missed by the track promoters as the British Greyhound Racing Board announced they were looking for a 'New Deal'. The BGR Fund stood at ¬£5 million and the BGRB headed by Chief Executive Geoffrey Thomas demanded a better deal, they drew up controversial plans to control the intellectual property rights and a continued battle ensued. The Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service were unwilling to pay more and significantly increased the prize money at the bookmaker owned tracks in an attempt to combat the threat of property rights. William Hill also bought their first greyhound track after securing a deal for Sunderland; a move seen as a consequence of the politics surrounding the 'New Deal'. Tracks fearing losing their BAGS contract eventually backed down leaving the industry dependent on bookmaker contributions. The dispute continued with regular bitter racing press headlines, the deal eventually died. Tracks The BS Group took over from Allied Presentations at Reading to add to their portfolio of tracks that included Swindon, Milton Keynes and Poole. News Australian stud dogs have a major influence in the breeding lines, Top Honcho an Australian born black dog became the top sire for the second year running. This further damaged the English breeding and Australian lines very often crossed which could be a problem. Racing Managers also noticed that Australian bred greyhounds brought a lack of track craft and lack of wide runners. Floyd Amphlett had predicted the Australian invasion way back in 1993. Charlie Lister suffered a suspected stroke, his head lad Chris Akers took on extra responsibilities at the Newark kennels. Seamus Cahill and Bernie Doyle both joined Wimbledon from Catford and Reading respectively. Kelly Mullins became the third son of former champion trainer Linda Mullins to enter the training ranks, he acquired kennels near Slough and began training in April. Competitions The Ladbrokes Summer Stayers Classic was introduced at Monmore with a ¬£7,500 to the winner and ¬£12,000 total prize money giving it Category One status, there were now 34 races listed as category one, a remarkable difference from the original ten classics. The Scottish Greyhound Derby at Shawfield Stadium increased their first prize to ¬£25,000 giving the event the second biggest reward behind the English Derby. Jonathan Hobbs of the Racing Post is instrumental in producing a successful greyhound annual. Top Savings won the Juvenile by 8¬æ lengths. Allen Gift made the Scurry Gold Cup final at Catford but had to be withdrawn, the race was won by Patsy Byrne's Letter Slippy. Allen Gift never found form again and the Derby champion had the injustice of losing in graded races at home track Hove towards the end of his career. Brian Clemenson won his first trainers championship before dominating the Cesarewitch with three finalists and the 4-5 favourite Cuba duly won. Cuba finished runner up to Sheriff Bow Wow in the Grand Prix final at Walthamstow. Sheriff Bow Wow in turn finished runner up to Alibuk Lad in the St Leger final. Ireland Compared to 2001 the Irish year was relatively quiet despite the star greyhound Late Late Show winning the early season BCR Press Easter Cup. By the time he made an attempt at the Derby he was passed his best form; the Derby went to Bypass Byway who was duly voted Irish Dog of the Year.

He would be the interpreter on board the Spanish expedition sent to expel the English speaking population of the archipelago in 1789. He himself having arrived in the New World nine years prior to this at the young age of 16. Rather than their expulsion (agreed to by the colonial powers under the Treat of Versailles and the Convention of 1786) he would be instrumental in not only helping secure the position of the existing inhabitants (English speaking Protestants), but would become their Governor and have a significant impact on the islands at a pivotal time in their history. Early life and career Tom√°s Francisco O'Neill y Salm√≥n was born in Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife, on October 5th 1764 to Patricio O'Neill (28th April 1740Registrar of Baptism, Trinity Within (Cathedral Parish) Waterford Ireland \\\\- 18th April 1768Parroquia Nuestra Se√±ora de la Pe√±a de Francia, Puerto de la Cruz Enterramientos Defunciones 1755 - 1790 L-6 Pagina 117) and Catalina Salm√≥n. His father, Patricio or Patrick was a native of Waterford Ireland, and was a vice consul for the British.Archivo Historico Provincial de Santa Cruz de Tenerife Letter Patricio O'Neill Caja 3834 Page 185, 1766 He had arrived in Tenerife three years prior to his marriage to Catalina, which took place in January 1764. Patrick had close connections with the network of Irish merchants operating from Tenerife, including the wealthy Cologan family. His Mother, Catalina was born in Tenerife, though it¬¥s possible both her parents, Thomas Salm√≥n and Catalina (Catherine) Comerford were Irish. Sadly both O¬¥Neill¬¥s parents died when he and his brother Enrique were young and both were raised by their Aunt, Mar√≠a Salm√≥n. O'Neill was raised on the Canarian Island of Tenerife, by his Aunt on his Mother's side of the family, Mar√≠a Salm√≥n. Leaving his native Tenerife he first tried his luck in the English speaking new world, spending two and a half years in Charleston South CarolinaArchivo Hist√≥rico Provincial de Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Fondo Z√°rate- C√≥logan, Correspondencia, Caja 45 Letter from Tom√°s O'Neill to Tom√°s C√≥logan. August 8, 1796. However it would be in the Spanish speaking New World where he would pursue his career. Together with his brother Enrique, he served in the Spanish military in the last two decades of the 1700s, and in the early years of the 1800s. Tom√°s O'Neill served in the Regimiento de Infanteria Fijo de Cartagena in Cartagena de Indias, together with Enrique. In 1791 Tom√°s was a lieutenant in the sixth company of the first battalion.  Tom√°s O'Neill arrives on San Andr√©s  In December 1789, O'Neill, at the age of 25, was part of a Spanish mission under captain Juan de Gastel√∫ to the islands of San Andr√©s and Providence in the western Caribbean. He was a lieutenant and interpreter. Coming from Irish heritage he did speak English, although Ireland itself in the 1700s remained a bilingual country. The aim of the mission was to enforce the terms of the Treaty of Versailles by evacuating all non-Spanish settlers from Spanish territories. This included the San Andr√©s Archipelago, Corn Islands and the Miskito coast. O'Neill's bilingual skills were necessary as San Andr√©s, at that time, was populated with English speaking landowners, their families and slaves. Some of the settlers left San Andr√©s prior to the Spanish missions arrival however others remained. \\"On December 21, 1789, the mission arrived in San Andr√©s. At dawn, Gastel√∫ summoned the inhabitants and ordered them to evacuate, giving them until April 1790, four months to collect and transport their belongings\\". It seems that O'Neill did more than interpret and in fact assisted in the mediation process between the Spanish Crown forces and the Islanders\\". O¬¥Neill assisted in formulating the petition to the Spanish authorities for the Islanders to remain on the islands with the promise that they would be loyal subjects. \\"Compunct the inhabitants sent to Cartagena as their representative, the Irishman Lorenzo Thine with their pleas to the Crown\\". This petition was funneled through the Viceroy Antonio Caballero y G√≥ngora.  Governorship  In 1792 Madrid acquiesced to the Islanders remaining and in 1795 O¬¥Neill was appointed as governor of the islands and promoted to the rank of Captain. The islands would fall under the jurisdiction of the Captain-General of Guatemala. This remained the situation until 1803, when per a request from O'Neill (with the support of the islanders), the islands (together with the Miskito Coast) were transferred to the Viceroyalty of Nueva Granada, and thus they came under the administration of Cartagena. This change was, of course, significant, as in essence, this is why, they are today part of Colombia. The Miskito Coast was transferred back to Guatemala in 1806. The American geographer James J. Parsons characterized O'Neill's rule as one of a \\"benevolent dictator\\" and that in O'Neill, the Islanders had a champion before the Spanish Court. His detractors have accused him of being an opportunist and of essentially being an eighteenth-century lobbyist, having a habit of writing letters requesting appointments for himself and promotion. O'Neill's connections with the Spanish Court were through his network in Cartagena and the Canaries. He followed a pragmatic policy regarding the hispanisation of the existing population and an even more lax attitude to trading restrictions imposed against trading with non-Spanish ports in the western Caribbean. The islands were supposed to only trade with Cartagena and Trujillo in Honduras. He was not dogmatic in imposing Catholicism taking a soft approach to the issue, preferring islanders as \\"buenos herejes no como malos cat√≥licos\\". However it does seem he himself was a devout Catholic. In 1797 O¬¥Neill, asked the Spanish Crown to send two Catholic priests for the attention of the faithful in San Andres. He justified his request by lamenting in a letter that even his own wife and nine others had died without the last spiritual help, nor the reception of the holy oils. A Catholic priest was appointed and sent from the mainland in 1803 on a salary of 30 pesos a month and a church was constructed with funds from the Royal Treasury and Royal Coffers in Cartagena. His pragmatic approach also extended to economic activities. O'Neill may not only have overlooked trading in contraband, but in fact have participated in such activities. Especially in interactions with his business partner on the mainland, his father-in-law, Agustin de Alfaro in Le√≥n de Nicaragua. It has been argued that O¬¥Neill lobbied for the removal of the islands from the jurisdiction of Guatemala, to that of Nueva Granada (Catagena) in order to keep authorities above him at a distance. Leaving these accusations aside, he did provide a stable government on the islands and regularized land ownership on the islands, granting titles to land parcels to the islanders. The economy thrived and the population grew under his tenure. He appointed alcaldes (mayors) and brought to San Andr√©s its first school teacher. His jurisdiction was, of course, an archipelago yet O'Neill tended to focus his attention on the island of San Andr√©s and left the islands of Providencia and Santa Catalina in the hands of Francis Archbold. The latter, a settler of Scottish heritage had come from Jamaica and had been instrumental in the resettlement of the two more northern islands. Between 1798 and 1800, O¬¥Neill was recalled to the continent (he married there in 1800Archivo General de Simancas, Secretar√≠a de Estado y del Despacho de Guerra: Marrage License) for reasons relating to the outbreak of new hostilities between Spain and Great Britain. The authorities believed the islands would be difficult to defend and O'Neill's abilities would be better utilized in Guatemala. During his absence in 1799, San Andr√©s experienced a slave uprising. He returned to San Andr√©s in 1801. In his absence, Torquiel Bowie, an islander, stood in as his replacement. On his return he was welcomed back as he was viewed by the islanders as a \\"kind, enterprising and progressive man\\" he however seemingly found the island in disarray. Overall his policy with the continent was one of engagement. He established good relations with the King of the Miskito Coast. Indeed one of his last acts as governor was to sign a treaty with the Coast and its King, Stephen (Regent, 1800‚Äì1816).  British invasion  On 26 March 1806 Captain John Bligh arrived on the H.M.S. Surreyance with 144 sailors and soldiers. With only around 30 soldiers in the island's garrison, O¬¥Neill was persuaded to surrender. Bligh thus took control of the islands. He transported O'Neill to the continent and dropped him, his brother Enrique, a priest, and his men on a beach near Cartagena. As he had surrendered to Bligh, he was court-marshalled by the authorities, but was subsequently acquitted. O'Neill returned to the Islands on the 17th of October 1807. Bligh having left the islands poorly defended, O'Neill and his military force took back the islands for Spain.  Resignation  O'Neill continued as Governor until he resigned in 1810 citing ill health. There are a number of theories on O'Neill's resignation. Some argue that having returned to Cartagena (against his will) O'Neill had become aware of the winds blowing in the direction of revolution against Spanish rule. The invasion had damaged his administration's infrastructure and there were limited financial resources to restore this. Despite promotion for himself and a government salary, funding of O'Neill's administration seemed to have been problematic. In that the higher authorities had instituted special tax concessions and tax exemptions on commercial activities which adversely impacted the financing of his administration.  Personal life and family  Tom√°s O'Neill and his brother Enrique served the Spanish Crown in Cartagena de Indias and \\"became part of the elite of the city through two fortunate marriages\\". Unfortunately, Tom√°s's fortunate marriage was to end when his wife died on San Andr√©s, as he lamented in a letter in 1797 that there was no priest on the island to give her the last rights. He did marry again, to Mar√≠a Manuela Alfaro de Monterroso in 1800 the daughter of Agust√≠n de Alfaro his business agent in Le√≥n (modern day Nicaragua). O¬¥Neill did have a daughter, Ann Eliza (1817-1862) who would grow up and marry Philip Beekman Jr. A man who also would have a significant impact on the history of the Archipelago. Little is known about Enrique O'Neill (2 February 1766Archivo Hist√≥rico Diocesano de San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna, Parroquial de Ntra. Sra. de la Pe√±a de Francia en Puerto de la Cruz, Partida sacramental del bautismo de Enrique Jos√© Maria de Candelaria O¬¥Neill Salm√≥n 1766 libro 8 de bautismos, folio 77. ‚Äì unknown). He came to the Americas under Tomas's patronage and acted as captain of the guard (this was made up of around 30 soldiers) in San Andr√©s. He it seems also married well in Cartagena. The O'Neill brothers did have a sister, Juana Maria, born on 15 April 1767Archivo Hist√≥rico Diocesano de San Crist√≥bal de La Laguna, Parroquial de Ntra. Sra. de la Pe√±a de Francia en Puerto de la Cruz, Partida sacramental del bautismo de Juana Maria O¬¥Neill Salm√≥n, 1767 libro 8 de bautismos, folio 87v. However other than a baptismal record no other records of her have come to light. Little is also known regarding Tom√°s O'Neill's activities after he stood down as governor. He did have a daughter, born in 1817, seven years after he stood down. We also know that in 1822 Tom√°s O'Neill was on the island council, and that one of the signatures of a document proclaiming the Archipelago¬¥s loyalty to Colombia, was in that same year, signed by him.

History  PrivatBank was founded in 1992 by co-founders Ihor Kolomoiskyi who is also a co-founder of the financial and industrial Privat Group, and Hennadii Boholiubov, who both controlled 92% of the bank's shares before its nationalization by the state, while Serhii Tihipko was appointed as a manager. By the moment of bank's nationalization at the end of 2016 it had become the largest private bank in Ukraine. As of today, more than 22 million customers have opened their accounts in the bank; it serves about 60% of transactions and half of payment cards issued in Ukraine, and 40% of deposits of the entire banking system are concentrated in it. Despite the dynamic growth of the retail banking sector, the National Bank of Ukraine recorded serious problems with the capital adequacy ratio, the loan portfolio, and the institution's compliance with the standards. After the bank's stress testing had been completed, the scale of problems that threatened the firmness of the entire banking system of Ukraine became obvious. In February 2016, the bank's shareholders agreed to transform the loan portfolio of the bank (transfer the debts to the bank to transparent, working businesses with real pledges, sufficient for servicing the loans) that would consequently reduce the bank's need for capital returning PrivatBank to the 5% framework of the capital adequacy. The ex-owners failed to meet the transformation deadline and to fully implement it. In February 2015, the National Council of Reforms identified eighteen priority reform areas, including a set of measures for reforming the financial sector of Ukraine (the Programme). The main goal of the Programme was to create a financial system able to redistribute efficiently financial resources in the economy based on the development of a full-fledged competitive environment according to the standards of the EU (including ensuring the firmness and reliability of the financial sector in the long run, making the standards of regulation of solvency and liquidity of banks comply with the recommendations of the Basel Committee)  Effects of the financial crisis of 2014‚Äì2015 in Ukraine  In response to the crisis in the banking sector in 2014-2015, the NBU improved the legislative and monitoring tools and conducted the diagnostic exercises of the largest banks. By the end of November 2014, the NBU retooling had been completed to identify troubled banks at an early stage. In April 2014, the Moody's Investors Service downgraded the ratings of PrivatBank and eleven other Ukrainian banks. In August 2014, the Standard & Poor's rating agency confirmed the long-term and short-term counterparty loan ratings of PrivatBank in the CCC/C scale. The Fitch downgraded the ratings of PrivatBank from CC/C to SD as a result of the debt (issued Eurobonds) restructuring agreement that had been signed. Along with financial sustainability gaps in many Ukrainian banks, the NBU recorded serious problems with the PrivatBank's capital adequacy ratio, the loan portfolio, and the institution's compliance with the standards. According to the financial statements of PrivatBank, which is quoted by the Fitch, the non-performing loans (NPL's) of the financial institution (overdue for more than ninety days) amounted to 8% of gross loans at the end of the first six months, which is significantly lower than the average for the banking system of Ukraine. It was said to be the result of regular write-offs and transfer of risks connected with the Crimea as well (in Q4 2014) into an unconsolidated structure controlled by the bank's shareholders. At the same time, the loans, devaluated on an individual basis and yet undue, remained at a noticeable level of 28% of all loans from the end of 2014 to the end of H1 2015. The coverage of the NPL's and devaluated on an individual basis with reserves was at a low level of 32% at the end of H1 2015. ‚ÄòSignificant levels of concentration of borrowers and sectors (the largest segment in oil trade accounted for 19% of the loans) and a significant share of foreign currency lending (43%) to borrowers who mostly do not have currency income, are additional sources of repayment risk‚Äô, the Fitch analytical materials report. ‚ÄòThe capital of the bank provides an insignificant ability to absorb losses, while the profit before deductions for impairment, adjusted for accrued income that is not paid in cash, is negative (for H1 2015, according to IFRS). The bank's stress testing had shown that PrivatBank faced serious problems. The bank's systemic importance particularly complicated the situation. PrivatBank's potential liquidation as a result of the capital deficit and the risk of the bank's corporate debtors‚Äô default would cause significant damage to the financial sector and the economy as a whole. The best option was a restructuring, and in February 2016, the NBU, the Board of PrivatBank, and its owners agreed on a Restructuring Plan (RP). In February 2016, the bank's shareholders agreed to transform the loan portfolio of the bank (which was one of the issues of the RP) that would consequently reduce the bank's need for capital returning PrivatBank to the 5% framework of the capital adequacy. Among different facts with capital inadequacy was that according to the ZN.ua journalists, the financial reports of the bank as of 1 January 2014 show that UAH 102.6 billion (97.5%) of UAH 105.5 billion of the bank's total corporate portfolio in hryvnias was provided to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Another journalists (Skhemy) have analysed a draft business review of PrivatBank prepared by the Ernst & Young. According to the journalists‚Äô investigation, the auditors have checked the biggest borrowers and found that as of 1 April 2015, the default risk amounted to over UAH 82 billion, and as of 1 October 2016, the figure increased to more than UAH 139 billion. According to the document, PrivatBank restructured its loan portfolio: the debt of 170 previous borrowers was transferred to more than 30 new ones making them owe the bank over UAH 110 billion.

Of all major borrowers of PrivatBank, journalists managed to identify only a few companies with real business. The well-known companies from the Privat Group account for about UAH 10 billion, which is 5% of the bank's total loan portfolio. The rest of the bank's borrowers are offshore companies (8% of PrivatBank's loan portfolio, or UAH 18 billion) and unknown LLCs, created in 2014‚Äì2016 and having strong connection with abroad and offshore businesses of ex-owners. PrivatBank's press-service denied results of journalist investigations: ‚ÄòAccording to financial reports of PrivatBank for the Q1 2016, prepared in accordance with IFRS, the percentage of loans to related parties in the loan portfolio (before provisions) is 6.1%‚Äô, states the bank's response. At the same time, the violation of the norm N9, which, according to the press-service of PrivatBank, is 38.5%, was due to methodological changes in the ruling of the NBU. ‚ÄòThe bank is working on making this indicator comply with the norm‚Äô, assured PrivatBank. The bank management made up a RP and insider-loan contraction plan. A bank shareholder provided the personal guarantee for this programme, but it failed. Valeriia Hontareva stated, ‚ÄòThe audit of the NBU has found a capital shortage in PrivatBank. As of 1 April 2015, it amounted to UAH 113 billion, as a result of the crisis in the Ukrainian economy and the improper lending policy of PrivatBank. Over 97% of the corporate portfolio, which amounted to UAH 150 billion as of 1 April 2015 was loans to individuals related to the shareholders of the company. The ex-owners sent letters to the Government and the NBU asking the government agencies to acquire a share in the bank's capital and undertake its sanation, while on their part, they guaranteed non- interference in the process and undertook to conduct the restructuring of the bank's loan portfolio to mid-2017 onwards. And by 18 December, the government had made a decision on the state's acquiring a share in the bank's capital. PrivatBank's ex-owner Ihor Kolomoiskyi in his comments to TSN (which is the newsprogramme of his media group 1+1) confirmed his appealing to the government with a request for the bank's nationalisation, ‚Äò...PrivatBank has become a victim of the NBU's tyranny. PrivatBank had a balanced secured loan portfolio, confirmed by the international audit. However, the NBU, by constantly changing its own standards, invented more and more ways to artificially reduce the bank's capitalisation. Then they began talking about a mythical UAH 150 billion hole, 97% of related loans, and all the money having been stolen or siphoned offshore. Although they obtained all of those figures as a result of arbitrary changes in accounting policies. Sound central banks help banks in difficult times, such as economic crises, occupation, or war, whereas our regulator used all the possible tricks to pin PrivatBank down. And, unfortunately, he managed to do it...‚Äô However, the ex-owners never implemented restructuring the bank's corporate portfolio as had been agreed, and in July 2017, the state resorted to the procedure of judicial recovery of pledges from the loan portfolio debtors. The General Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine, and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office have started several investigations related to PrivatBank and ex-owners. According to the financial statements of the bank verified by the Ernst & Young auditors, as of 31/12/2016, the provision for impairment of loans to legal entities was increased by UAH 155.9 billion. The Ernst & Young independent auditor's report concluded that the auditor had confirmed the low quality of the loan portfolio of PrivatBank, however, had not confirmed the financial results and cash-flows of the bank due to the fact that he had not been able to obtain sufficient audit evidence for the period of devaluation of loans and advances to clients. Such a conclusion suggests that PrivatBank had started experiencing financial problems long before 2016. Moreover, according to the regulator, the auditors determined the need for the creation of additional provisions of UAH 10 billion, which eventually led to PrivatBank's negative balance sheet value of UAH 882 million as of the end of 2016. Moreover in January 2018, the Kroll's (a company that provides consulting services and investigates cases of fraud, bribery, and corruption) investigation results were published, which confirmed that before the nationalisation, PrivatBank had been the subject of large- scale and coordinated fraudulent actions, resulting in losses of at least $5.5 billion. Findings of the investigation: # Siphoning off the funds to acquire assets and finance the businesses of the ex-shareholders and their affiliated persons. # Hiding the funds‚Äô sources of origin by the ex-owners. Concealing the sources and the real purpose of loans, the lack of a substantiated link between the person who repays the loan and the original borrower, as well as the widespread use of offshore companies. # A bank within a bank. The ex- owners of the bank created a shadow banking structure within PrivatBank. It ensured conducting payments and contributed to the flow of funds in favour of parties related to the former shareholders. This secret scheme involved hundreds of employees of PrivatBank. # The structure and management of loans. The shadow banking structure managed the corporate loan portfolio of related parties. It controlled the provision of new loans that were commonly used to repay the principal and interest of related parties‚Äô existing loans (cyclical re-lending). It provided transactions to hide the source and true purpose of loan funds, creating the impression of being a regular customer-oriented bank. # The balance. Before the December 2016 nationalisation, over 95% of the corporate loan portfolio was provided to parties related to former shareholders and groups of affiliated persons. At the end of 2016, 75% of the loan portfolio was consolidated in loans to thirty-six borrowers related to former shareholders and groups of affiliated persons. Most of them are not repaid and are overdue, resulting in the bank's losses amounting to at least 5.5 billion US dollars. Oleksandr Danyliuk, ex-Minister of Finance of Ukraine: ‚ÄòTo a certain moment, the money of PrivatBank was exclusively the money of its depositors... And these deposits were used to lend the business of the group, for the purposes of its owners. In the end, this resulted in certain problems, and the state was forced to intervene and protect the depositors‚Ä¶‚Äô NBU also filed claim to court of Cyprus against PwC seeking $3 bln compensation. Hennadii Boholiubov, former co-owner of the bank, sent the government of Ukraine a notice claiming compensation for the ‚Äòillegal expropriation‚Äô of his share of funds in PrivatBank. In his address, he described the circumstances under which PrivatBank worked during 2015‚Äì2016, indicating that it was the most capitalised bank by the end of 2015. Boholiubov noted that during October‚ÄìDecember 2016, the National Bank of Ukraine drastically changed its requirements to the bank, putting it intentionally under pressure. In his opinion, Ukraine was waging a successful and coordinated media campaign to destabilise the situation with PrivatBank, followed by the nationalisation of the financial institution. However, he did not specify the total amount of claims, while clarifying that in case of refusal, he, as a citizen of the United Kingdom, would apply to an independent arbitral tribunal.  Nationalization results  Today, PrivatBank is a fully recapitalized state- owned bank. On 25 April 2017, the S&P; reported an increase in credit ratings of PrivatBank from SD to CCC+/C and stated the bank's rating outlook as ‚Äúa stable\\". The Moody's also raised ratings of PrivatBank‚Äîfrom Caa3 to Caa2. Meanwhile, more than 400 lawsuits have been filed against the NBU in Ukraine. State-owned PrivatBank in December 2017 filed a lawsuit to the High Court of Justice in England against Kolomoisky, Boholiubov, as well as the companies Teamtrend Ltd., Trade Point Agro Ltd., Collyer Ltd., Rossyan Investing Corp., Milbert Ventures Inc. and ZAO Ukrtransitservice Ltd., which allegedly belong to them or are under their control. The court, as an interim measure, issued a ruling for the worldwide seizure of the assets of the former owners of the bank, Kolomoisky and Boholiubov and the said six companies, for more than $2.5 billion. The court obliged Kolomoisky and Boholiubov to disclose information about all their assets to a limited circle of people who are taking part in the hearing of the lawsuit. A new banking law approved by Ukraine's parliament in April 2020 was designed to prevent Kolomoisky and Boholiubov from regaining control of PrivatBank.IMF praises Ukraine's decisions on land reform, banking law, Reuters (4 April 2020) IMF finally confirms new $5 billion program for Ukraine by Anders √Öslund, Atlantic Council (10 June 2020)  References  Category:Nationalization Category:Banks of Ukraine Category:2016 in Ukraine ","title":"Nationalization of PrivatBank"},{"id":"57792926","text":"Gekko gulat is a species of gecko.

This form of advertising is often associated with low quality \\"clickbait\\" links and articles. The term derives from the fishing term \\"chumming\\" ‚Äì referring to the use of fish meat as a lure for fish. Overview Chumboxes became popular during early 2010. They are often presented to the reader as additional reading intended, and use headings such as \\"around the Web\\" and \\"you might like.\\" The use of chumboxes became common on many mainstream websites, including those of CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, USA Today, and others. Providers of this content included Outbrain, Taboola, and others. In mid-2010, the addition of such ad platforms to large journalism-based sites was said to provide over $10 million per year extra revenue. Casey Newton (The Verge) concluded that the ad format was likely to be short lived, similar to schemes such as Groupon; though clickthrough on such ads was in the single-digit percentage region (compared to 0.1% for banner ads), this figure was comparable to that early experienced by banner ads ‚Äì he expected that as with banner ads, users would eventually come to learn of the low utility of such links, and eventually avoid them. By the mid-to-late 2016, some websites were re-thinking the use of \\"chumboxes\\" due to the negative impact such low-quality links and content had on their brands, despite the additional income from such links. An analysis of images used in advertising of the kind found that 26% used sexually suggestive or \\"interruptive\\" images; often the ads had no relation to the article content, and on occasions were inappropriate or offensive, such as one titled \\"Meet the Women Making Rape Jokes That Are Actually Funny,\\" placed under an article about teenage rape. The Clickbait Report by changeadvertising.org analysed 50 high rank news sites and found that over 80% were using such ads, the majority from Taboola or Outbrain. Many were found to be confusing or misleading in their purpose. An analysis of images and headlines used in such adverts found a number of basic archetypes used ‚Äì these included: a sexy image in association with location-based advertisement; reverse aging (skin) treatment based, or \\"miracle cure\\"; body shock images (e.g. triggering Trypophobia etc.); celebrity gossip based; tattoo-based images, including those simulating body horror or orifices; images of pills, and weight loss.

It was built in 1890 for industrialist Chester F. Wickwire (1843‚Äì1910), and was designed by architect Samuel B. Reed. Chester Wickwire lived in the home from 1890 until his death in 1910. He made his fortune by founding and managing the Wickwire Brothers Company in Cortland, NY, which produced wire products such as horse muzzles, seed spreaders, insect screens, and similar products for rural Americans. In 1974, the 1890 House Museum formed a part of the Tompkins Street District's listing on the National Register of Historic Places, and in 1975, the 1890 House became a museum after campaigning from Cortland County leaders. History First Wickwire Family =Family= Chester, his wife Ardell, and their sons Charles and Frederic moved into the house on June 1, 1890. After Chester's death in 1910, Ardell Wickwire lived in the house until her death in 1915. Charles Wickwire and Frederic Wickwire Chester was born in McGraw, NY to a farming family, and moved to the city of Cortland at age nineteen. He married Ardell Rouse from Greene, NY on October 2, 1866. They had three children, Raymond, Charles and Frederic. Raymond died at age five of scarlet fever in 1878, and his two younger brothers followed their father into the family business. =Margaret Stack= In addition to the Wickwire family, many servants lived at the mansion. One servant, a twenty one year old Irish cook named Margaret Stack, immigrated from Athea, County Limerick, Ireland in 1904. She arrived on Ellis Island with two of her siblings. Stack worked at the house from 1904 to 1911, after which she moved back to Ireland with her husband, a fellow Irish immigrant named John Lane, who she met in Cortland. Visitors to the house can view Margaret Stack's bedroom and learn about the lives of Victorian servants. Second Wickwire Family After Ardell's death, the house lay dormant for eight years until Frederic moved in with his wife Marion, a local poet. Frederic and Marion made several renovations to the house, reflecting the style and tastes of the 1920s. Frederic died in 1929, and Marion later remarried local judge C. Leonard O‚ÄôConnor. Marion Goodrich Wickwire O‚ÄôConnor outlived her second husband as well, and lived in the house until 1973. Wickwire Brothers Factory Chester Wickwire in the Wickwire Brothers Factory In 1873, Chester Wickwire received a carpet loom, which he adapted to weave wire instead. In the process, he discovered a cheaper method for manufacturing wire products, and he opened his own factory with his brother, Theodore, which they called the Wickwire Brothers Company. By 1883, they had become the second largest producer of wire goods in the United States, thanks in part to Chester's patents. The Wickwires hired many immigrants, mainly from Germany, Italy, Russia, and Ireland. The employees worked on an assembly line, which proved to be dangerous. The factory saw seven industrial accidents between 1887 and 1897. In February 1888, a 14-year-old boy lost his toes and part of his foot. In April 1888, one man had his fingers mangled in the gears of a loom. Museum Today The museum offers guided and self-guided tours for visitors, who can view 14 rooms on three floors, as well as a cupola. The 1890 House offers monthly educational programs and special events, and film a monthly YouTube series called WickWired, focusing on the Victorian age and the lives of the Wickwire Family.

It was only first published in Portuguese in 1980. The first English version, translated by Margaret Jull Costa, was published by Dedalus Books in 2000, to coincide with the centenary of the author‚Äôs death.  Background  This novel was written between 1877 and 1878 in Newcastle upon Tyne, where E√ßa was the Portuguese Consul. It was discovered amongst his papers after his death and remained unpublished for more than one hundred years, only being published in 1980 after copyrights expired. It is possible that the writer's family refused to publish the book earlier due to the fact that an incestuous relationship is the dominant feature of the story. For some commentators the novel was designed to serve as an outline for the author‚Äôs novel The Maias, as it contains resemblances between characters and events described ; for others it has been seen as a draft for his novel Cousin Bazilio.  The Plot  The narrative focuses on the beautiful Joaquina (later known as Genoveva) who leaves her husband and child in Portugal and flees with a Spaniard to Spain, where she becomes a courtesan, eventually marrying a French Senator and moving to Paris. With the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte and the death of the husband, she returns to Lisbon where she attracts considerable attention both for her beauty and because of her mysterious history. She becomes a paid mistress of the unattractive, but rich, D√¢maso while, at the same time, falling in love with a young man called V√≠tor da Silva. Only after their love has been consummated does she learn that she is Vitor‚Äôs mother, and this leads to her suicide so that Vitor will not discover the truth.  Reviews and analysis  While considered a fairly unpolished work that may not have been regarded by the author as his final version, the reviews have noted the high quality of the English translation. However, several commentators express surprise that, in her Introduction to the novel, the translator gives away the plot. Although the story is tragic, the book is primarily a satirical portrait of 19th-century Lisbon society, a feature common to most of E√ßa‚Äôs work. It has been described as a ‚Äúfascinating visit to a period with a very different approach to morality‚Äù, and as having ‚Äúbeautiful descriptions of 19th century Portuguese life with a huge amount of satire and societal critique layered thick on top.‚Äù A strong vein of both comedy and tragedy runs throughout, while Eca \\"delights in shocking in order to expose the puritanical, narrow-minded Portuguese society\\". The satire begins early in the novel, when Genoveva throws a party. This allows E√ßa to describe typical characters from Lisbon society. The influence of the founder of Literary realism, Honor√© de Balzac (1799-1850), author of novels that depict Parisian society, can be detected. Particularly amusing is Camilo, ‚Äúa pretentious artist, full of talk but little action, who goes on and on about art history and styles and technique, but never paints anything.‚Äù E√ßa ‚Äúbrilliantly dissects a world in which only surface counts, providing the reader with a vivid and gripping portrayal of a society and class consumed by hypocrisy, greed and materialism.‚Äù Several writers have explored the role of incest in E√ßa‚Äôs works. Ponte notes that in Greek Tragedy incest represented the protagonist‚Äôs hopeless fight against fate. . As an allegory for social decadence incest is found elsewhere in nineteenth-century literature, most notably in √âmile Zola‚Äôs La Cur√©e. In her Introduction to the book, the translator suggests that this could have been one reason why the book was neither published by E√ßa nor his heirs, speculating that the incidents described were ‚Äútoo close to home‚Äù. E√ßa was born illegitimately and although his parents did eventually marry he lived apart from them until he was 21. In The Tragedy of the Street of Flowers, V√≠tor first sees his mother when he is 23. Film adaptation In 1981, the book was adapted for a Portuguese television series, titled Hom√≥nimo, directed by Ferr√£o Katzenstein.

The subsequent recording on the Innova label and dozens of favorable reviews brought Smith's name to international attention. Gramophone Magazine called it \\"a spectacular work.\\" David Patrick Stearns of the Philadelphia Inquirer called it Smith's \\"creative breakthrough,\\"David Patrick Stearns (2009) Philadelphia Inquirer, \\"Composers' shared idea yields disparate works\\" also writing, \\"few such endeavors by Peteris Vasks, Giya Kancheli or Arvo P√§rt have Smith's lyrical immediacy and ability to find great musical variety while maintaining an overall coherent personality... miniature Sch√ºtz-like strokes... never lapsed into potentially cheap picturesque effects... close in spirit to liturgical-minded composers who wouldn't let effects eclipse words.\\" Musicweb International chose Vespers as its January 2010 Recording of the Month,MusicWeb International, January 2010 Recording of the Month Robert Hugill writing that it is \\"totally modern, without ever being simplistic... accessible without ever talking down.\\" Peter Burwasser, writing for Fanfare Magazine, put it on his 2009 Want List, and writing for the Philadelphia City Paper, included it on his 2009 Top Ten Classical list. After 2015 concerts by Seraphic Fire, David Fleshler wrote in the South Florida Classical Review that \\"the work sounds like no other music.\\"David Fleshler (2015) South Florida Classical Review, \\"Seraphic Fire wraps season with Kile Smith's ethereal 'Vespers'\\" Burwasser, in a review of the CD for the Philadelphia City Paper, wrote, \\"This Vespers is almost preternaturally beautiful, presented with an apparent simplicity that reveals the timeless essence of musical expression. But it is not at all simple, as Smith subtly weaves contemporary figurations, pacing and textures into an old fabric. It is remarkable how seamless this effect is, and how utterly self-effacing is Smith's technique. A casual listener might miss the impact of Vespers, but not for long. The music seeps into the consciousness with gentle stealth and power, finally disarming any resistance... The sum of the parts is magical.\\" Vespers has received numerous performances by professional and university choirs, and one amateur choir.Linda Marie Bell (2016), Montgomeryville Patch, \\"'Acoustic Magnificence' Coming to Lansdale\\" Smith has transcribed much of it for different combinations of modern and Baroque instruments, and individual movements are performed separately, including several movements Choral Arts Philadelphia, under Matthew Glandorf, commissioned and premiered in 2018, arranged for the instrumentation of the J. S. Bach Cantata No. 1, Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern.Choral Arts Philadelphia, Bach Festival of Philadelphia, 2017-2018 Concert Season  Compositional style  Smith's music is modal and tonal. His voice-leading is meticulous, especially from Vespers (2008) on. Although he employs chromaticism on occasion, sometimes heavily, as in the middle movement of Where Flames a Word and in various songs, his pieces usually remain in one mode or key for extended periods. His music has always favored horizontal movement over vertical chord-building, which can lead to unexpected passing harmonies. He has often spoken of the influence of William Billings and early American shape-note and Southern Harmony composers in this respect. What Steven Ritter of Audiophile Audition wrote in his review of Vespers applies to much of Smith's music: \\"I'll call this music tonal with a twist; though modern, and it has some contemporary edges to it, it still feels almost uncomfortably familiar, a masterly m√©lange of old and new.\\" Counterpoint of independent voices has become a greater hallmark of his style since Vespers. He stated in an interview on the composing of Canticle that text-painting is always important in his choral and vocal music.BelCantoChorus, Kile Smith's Comments on \\"Canticle\\" (video) Performers and critics have noted the \\"vocal quality\\" of his music.Elaine Schmidt (2017), Journal Sentinel, \\"Bel Canto Chorus serves feast of contemporary choral music\\"  Works   Orchestral  Smith has composed over 20 orchestral works, including a Symphony: Lumen ad revelationem (2002) premiered by the Lehigh Valley Chamber Orchestra.

In 2011 it had a population of 4,240. History The village was founded and developed from the discovery of a copper field in Minas de Matahambre, in 1912. It was built a road from the deposit to the sea and, one year later, a pier in the new harbor of Santa Luc√≠a. During the 1980s, because of the mining development, the population grew and the satellite village of La Sabana was built east of it. La Sabana on EcuRed Geography Santa Luc√≠a lies between a marsh, by the Atlantic Coast, and the Sierra de los √ìrganos mountain range (part of Guaniguanico). (location) It spans on a plain strip, along with the neighboring and satellite village of La Sabana, with whom it forms a small urban area of about 10,000 inhabitants.

It is the equivalent of \\"double\\" in other games. The term comes from the Latin word, contra, which means \\"against\\". In German there is also a verb, kontrieren, which means \\"to double\\" or \\"to announce 'Kontra'\\".  Use in card games   Tarock  If a player is given the right to bid in Tarock games, an opponent may announce Kontra if he thinks the soloist is unlikely to win. This doubles the value of the game. If the soloist believes that he can still win the game, he may reply with Rekontra (or Re for short), which doubles the game value again. In Tarock, a further doubling is allowed by saying Subkontra (or Sub for short) or, occasionally Hirsch (\\"stag\\"), a joking reference to the German word, Re(h), which means \\"doe\\", and results in the original game value increasing by a factor of 8.  Skat  Announcing Kontra in Skat is very common, but is not part of the official rules. Players often say Supra instead of Subkontra. In many game rounds the stakes may be doubled again and the game value upped sixteenfold, but this is rather rare in practice. These announcements vary widely, for example, in some circles the announcement Hirsch follows Bock which is used to mean \\"Supra\\".  Doppelkopf  In Doppelkopf the side that has the Queen of Clubs announces a \\"double\\" with Re, while their opponents say Kontra. This makes it clear which side is bidding.  Schafkopf  In Schafkopf, the regional term, Spritz and the verb, spritzen, are used.  Watten  In Watten, the term Kontra is not used, but a similar practice is very common. It is known as ausschaffen. So the announcements, \\"you going?\\" (\\"geht ihr?\\") or \\"three\\" (\\"drei\\") raise the game value from the normal two points to three points. Other increments such as \\"four\\" or \\"five\\" may be announced alternately (until the number of points need for a win is reached, i.e. in the first game at a theoretical 15). However, the game value is not doubled each time.  Backgammon and chess  The concept of Kontra is found in the sense of doubling in Backgammon: if a player believes during the course of a game, that his opponent can no longer win. he can bid a \\"double\\". The opponent can either accept it or resign and take the points gained so far. The doubling rule in backgammon was invented in a New York club in the 1920sc.f. e.g. John R. Crawford, Oswald Jacoby: The Backgammon Book, The Viking Press Inc., New York, 1970 and enriched the game in a very important way. Less well known is that doubling (in exactly the same way as in backgammon) is occasionally used as a \\"coffee house rule\\" today in chess when it is played for money. If a play wants to double the stake, he may say Kontra.c.f. e.g. Ab und zu wurde eine Zweierblitzpartie mit ATS f√ºnf und \\"Kontra\\" gespielt, da konnte man sich an guten Tagen durchaus das Geld f√ºr eine ganze Studienwoche verdienen. Many backgammon players also allow the so-called Beaver, which corresponds to the German Rekontra: if the player who has had a double bid against him is sure of winning he can use this announcement to double the stakes again without giving up his right to use the doubling cube. In many circles the opponent may respond with Raccoon raising the game value eight times, and the player may double a final time by saying Skunk or Otter; then however the dice must be thrown. This simple doubling is not part of the official rules of backgammon and is explicitly banned in tournaments.  Kontraschnapser  In the card game of Bauernschnapsen there are special contracts of Kontraschnapser and Kontrabauer. Unlike other card games, Kontra in this case means that the opponents of the side that chose the trumps, want to announced a contract with this trump suit.

Cardinal Giuseppe Maria Feroni. A famous bust of him by Andre-Jean Lebrun is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Biography Feroni came from the wealthy noble family of the Marquises of Bellavista. He was the son of Marchese Fabio Feroni and Costanza della Stufa. He studied at the Collegio Clementino in Rome, the Pontifical Diplomatic Academy, and La Sapienza University, where in 1716 he was awarded his doctorate. On January 16, 1716, he entered the Roman prelature as a candidate for the Apostolic Protonotary, and on January 23 of the same year he became a clerk at the Apostolic Signatura. He was ordained a priest on October 22, 1719. Pope Clement XI appointed him to be a canon of the Lateran Basilica. He was appointed a titular archbishop on May 10, 1728. Pope Benedict XIII appointed him a bishop on May 30, 1728 in St. Peter's Basilica. His Co- Consecrators were Francesco Scipione Maria Borghese, Titular Archbishop of Traianopolis, and Nicola Saverio Santamaria, Titular Bishop of Cyrene. In the consistory of November 26, 1753, he was appointed cardinal priest and was installed on December 10, 1753 as Titular Archbishop of Damascus in the titular church San Pancrazio. He participated in the Conclave of 1758, which chose Pope Clement XIII. From January 28, 1760 to February 16, 1761 he was Camerlengo of the College of Cardinals. After the death of Cardinal Fortunato Tamburini on August 9, 1761, Feroni became prefect of the Congregation of the Holy Rite. On December 17, 1764 he received the titular church Santa Cecilia as his see. In the fall of 1765 he moved to Siena, where he was abbot of the Abbey of San Galgano. (By that time, the abbey was already in decline, so this was probably his retirement home.) Feroni died on 15 November 1767 in Rome of a kidney disease. His final resting place with an elegant tomb is in his titular church Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. Sources * (for Chronology of Bishops) * FIU website article.

The data center houses the enterprise applications and data, hence why providing a proper security system is critical. Denial of service (DoS), theft of confidential information, data alteration, and data loss are some of the common security problems afflicting data center environments.Maurizio Portolani, Mauricio Arregoces(2004). Data Center Fundamentals. Publishers, Cisco Press, 800 East 96th Street Indianapolis, IN 46240 USA, Chap.5 Overview According to the Cost of a Data Breach Survey,The Four Layers of Data Center Physical Security for a comprehensive and integrated Approach in which 49 U.S. companies in 14 different industry sectors participated, they noticed that: * 39% of companies say negligence was the primary cause of data breaches * Malicious or criminal attacks account for 37 percent of total breaches. * The average cost of a breach is $5.5 million. The need for a secure data center Physical security is needed to protect the value of the hardware therein. Data protection The cost of a breach of security can have severe consequences on both the company managing the data center and on the customers whose data are copied. The 2012 breach at Global Payments, a processing vendor for Visa, where 1.5 million credit card numbers were stolen, highlights the risks of storing and managing valuable and confidential data. As a result, Global Payments' partnership with Visa was terminated; it was estimated that they lost over $100 million. =Insider attacks= Defenses against exploitable software vulnerabilities are often built on the assumption that \\"insiders\\" can be trusted.2003 CSI/FBI report \\"Computer Crime and Security Survey.\\" Studies show that internal attacks tend to be more damaging because of the variety and amount of information available inside organizations. Vulnerabilities and common attacks The quantity of data stored in data centers has increased, partly due to the concentrations created by cloud-computing Threats Some of the most common threats to Data Centers: * DoS (Denial of Service) * Data theft or alteration * Unauthorized use of computing resources * Identity theft Vulnerabilities Common vulnerabilities include: * Implementation: Software design and protocol flaws, coding errors, and incomplete testing * Configuration: Use of defaults, elements inappropriately configured =Exploitation of out-of-date software= Many \\"worm\\" attacks on data centers exploited well-known vulnerabilities: * CodeRed * Nimda and * SQL Slammer =Exploitation of software defaults= Many systems are shipped with default accounts and passwords, which are exploited for unauthorized access and theft of information. Common attacks Common attacks include: * _Scanning or Probing_ : One example of a probe- or scan-based attack is a port scan - whereby \\"requests to a range of server port addresses on a host\\" are used, to find \\"an active port\\" and then cause harm via \\"a known vulnerability of that service.\\". This reconnaissance activity often precedes an attack; its goal is to gain access by discovering information about a system or network. * _DoS (Denial of service)_ : A denial-of-service attack occurs when legitimate users are unable to access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor. This type of attack generates a large volume of data to deliberately consume limited resources such as bandwidth, CPU cycles, and memory blocks. * _Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)_ : This kind of attack is a particular case of DoS where a large number of systems are compromised and used as source or traffic on a synchronized attack. In this kind of attack, the hacker does not use only one IP address but thousands of them.Khalifeh,, Soltanian, Mohammad Reza. Theoretical and experimental methods for defending against DDoS attacks. Amiri, Iraj Sadegh, 1977-. Waltham, MA. . OCLC 930795667. 400px * _Unauthorized Access_ : When someone other than an account owner uses privileges associated to a compromised account to access to restricted resources using a valid account or a backdoor.GIAC Certifications. Global Information Assurance Certification Paper. * _Eavesdropping_ : Etymologically, Eavesdropping means Secretly listen to a conversation.\\"eavesdrop - Definition of eavesdrop in English by Oxford Dictionaries\\". Oxford Dictionaries - English. In the networking field, it is an unauthorized interception of information (usernames, passwords) that travels on the network. User logons are the most common signals sought. * _Viruses and Worms_ : These are malicious code that, when executed produce undesired results. Worms are self- replicating malware,Barwise, Mike. \\"What is an internet worm?\\". BBC. whereas viruses, which also can replicate, need some kind of human action to cause damage.Stallings, William (2012). Computer security : principles and practice. Boston: Pearson. p. 182. . * _Internet Infrastructure Attacks_ : This kind of attack targets the critical components of the Internet infrastructure rather than individual systems or networks. * _Trust Exploitation_ : These attacks exploit the trust relationships that computer systems have to communicate. * _Session Hijacking_ also known as cookie hijacking: Consists of stealing a legitimate session established between a target and a trusted host. The attacker intercepts the session and makes the target believe it is communicating with the trusted host.\\"Warning of webmail wi-fi hijack\\". BBC News. August 3, 2007. * _Buffer Overflow Attacks_ : When a program allocates memory buffer space beyond what it had reserved, it results in memory corruption affecting the data stored in the memory areas that were overflowed. * _Layer 2 Attacks_ : This type of attack exploit the vulnerabilities of data link layer protocols and their implementations on layer 2 switching platforms. * _SQL injection_ : Also known as code injection, this is where input to a data-entry form's, due to incomplete data validation, allows entering harmful input that causes harmful instructions to be executed. Network security infrastructure The network security infrastructure includes the security tools used in data centers to enforce security policies. The tools include packet-filtering technologies such as ACLs, firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) both network-based and host-based. ACLs (Access Control List) ACLs are filtering mechanisms explicitly defined based on packet header information to permit or deny traffic on specific interfaces. ACLs are used in multiple locations within the Data Center such as the Internet Edge and the intranet server farm. The following describes standard and extended access lists: Standard ACLs: the simplest type of ACL filtering traffic solely based on source IP addresses. Standard ACLs are typically deployed to control access to network devices for network management or remote access. For example, one can configure a standard ACL in a router to specify which systems are allowed to Telnet to it. Standard ACLs are not recommended option for traffic filtering due to their lack of granularity. Standard ACLSs are configured with a number between 1 and 99 in Cisco routers. Extended ACLs: Extended ACL filtering decisions are based on the source and destination IP addresses, Layer 4 protocols, Layer 4 ports, ICMP message type and code, type of service, and precedence. In Cisco routers, one can define extended ACLs by name or by a number in the 100 to 199 range. Firewalls A firewall is a sophisticated filtering device that separates LAN segments, giving each segment a different security level and establishing a security perimeter that controls the traffic flow between segments. Firewalls are most commonly deployed at the Internet Edge where they act as boundary to the internal networks. They are expected to have the following characteristics: 400pxPerformance: the main goal of a firewall is to separate the secured and the unsecured areas of a network. Firewalls are then post in the primary traffic path potentially exposed to large volumes of data. Hence, performance becomes a natural design factor to ensure that the firewall meets the particular requirements. Application support: Another important aspect is the ability of a firewall to control and protect a particular application or protocol, such as Telnet, FTP, and HTTP. The firewall is expected to understand application-level packet exchanges to determine whether packets do follow the application behavior and, if they do not, do deny the traffic. There are different types of firewalls based on their packet-processing capabilities and their awareness of application-level information: # Packet- filtering firewalls # Proxy firewalls # Stateful firewalls # Hybrid firewalls IDSs IDSs are real-time systems that can detect intruders and suspicious activities and report them to a monitoring system. They are configured to block or mitigate intrusions in progress and eventually immunize the systems from future attacks. They have two fundamental components: * Sensors: Appliances and software agents that analyze the traffic on the network or the resource usage on end systems to identify intrusions and suspicious activities. * IDS management: Single- or multi-device system used to configure and administer sensors and to additionally collect all the alarm information generated by the sensors. The sensors are equivalent to surveillance tools, and IDS management is the control center watching the information produced by the surveillance tools. Layer 2 security Cisco Layer 2 switches provide tools to prevent the common Layer 2 attacks (Scanning or Probing, DoS, DDoS, etc.). The following are some security features covered by the Layer 2 Security: * Port Security * ARP Inspection * Private VLANs * Private VLANs and Firewalls Data center security measures The process of securing a Data Center requires both a comprehensive system-analysis approach and an ongoing process that improves the security levels as the Data Center evolves. The Data Center is constantly evolving as new applications or services become available. Attacks are becoming more sophisticated and more frequent. These trends require a steady evaluation of security readiness. A key component of the security-readiness evaluation is the policies that govern the application of security in the network including the Data Center. The application includes both the design best practices and the implementation details. As a result, security is often considered as a key component of the main infrastructure requirement. Since a key responsibility of the data centers is to make sure of the availability of the services, data center management systems often consider how its security affects traffic flows, failures, and scalability. Due to the fact that security measures may vary depending on the data center design, the use of unique features, compliance requirements or the company's business goals, there is no set of specific measures that cover all possible scenarios.Cisco SAFE Reference Guide chap.4 There exist in general two types of data center security: the Physical Security and the Virtual Security.Rich Banta Types of Data Center Security Physical Security The physical security of a data center is the set of protocol built-in within the data center facilities in order to prevent any physical damage to the machines storing the data. Those protocols should be able to handle everything ranging from natural disasters to corporate espionage to terrorist attacks.Sara D. Scalet 19 ways to build physical security into your data center To prevent physical attacks, data centers use techniques such as: * CCTV security network: locations and access points with 90-day video retention.Security and Data Center Overview * 24√ó7 ** on-site security guards, ** Network operations center (NOC) Services and technical team * Anti-tailgating/Anti-pass-back turnstile gate. Only permits one person to pass through after authentication. * Single entry point into co-location facility. * Minimization of traffic through dedicated data halls, suites, and cages. * Further access restriction to private cages * Three-factor authentication * SSAE 16 compliant facilities. * Checking the provenance and design of hardware in use * Reducing insider risk by monitoring activities and keeping their credentials safeGoogle Infrastructure Security Design Overview * Monitoring of temperature and humidity * Fire prevention with zoned dry-pipe sprinkler * Natural disaster risk-free locationsiliad Data Center['http://www.iliad- datacenter.com/pdf/iliad-dc-security.pdf' 'Data Center Security'] chap.4 Virtual Security Virtual security is security measures put in place by the data centers to prevent remote unauthorized access that will affect the integrity, availability or confidentiality of data stored on servers.Securing Microsoft's Cloud Infrastructure 2009. Virtual or network security is a hard task to handle as there exist many ways it could be attacked. The worst part of it is that it is evolving years after years. For instance, an attacker could decide to use a malware (or similar exploits) in order to bypass the various firewalls to access the data. Old systems may as well put security at risk as they do not contain modern methods of data security. Virtual attacks can be prevented with techniques such as * Heavy data encryption during transfer or not: 256-bit SSL encryption for web applications.1024-bit RSA public keys for data transfers. AES 256-bit encryption for files and databases. * Logs auditing activities of all users. * Secured usernames and passwords: Encrypted via 256-bit SSL, requirements for complex passwords, set up of scheduled expirations, prevention of password reuse. * Access based on the level of clearance. * AD/LDAP integration. * Control based on IP addresses. * Encryption of session ID cookies in order to identify each unique user. * Two-factor authentication availability. * Third party penetration testing performed annually * Malware prevention through firewalls and automated scannerData Centre Management References Category:Computer network security Category:Data breaches Category:Data centers Category:Data security Category:Information management ","title":"Data center security"},{"id":"57793259","text":"Tianranxiu n√©eGao (second half of 13th-century) was a Chinese actress (yueji) of the zaju theater.

After the 2016 Welsh Assembly election, Neil Hamilton was elected leader of the UK Independence Party group in the Assembly, replacing Nathan Gill. Hamilton had been supported by four AMs, whilst Gill had been supported by three. In May 2018, Caroline Jones replaced Hamilton after a majority vote in the then five- strong Assembly group. In June 2018, national deputy party leader Mike Hookem informed the group that an election would be held for the leadership of the Assembly group. Gareth Bennett won the UKIP Welsh Assembly leadership election on 10 August 2018. Hamilton remained as Leader of the UK Independence Party in Wales, with Bennett serving as Leader of UKIP in the Welsh Assembly. Campaign The party increased the franchise for the election, changing to a twenty-eight-day cutoff instead of the originally planned for a six-month cut- off. This increased the number of eligible voters by about 300 to \\"just short of 900\\". The vote had been scheduled to conclude by the end of July, but the count was moved to 10 August following issues printing ballots. Bennett's two main policy planks were his campaign to abolish the Welsh Assembly itself (he called for a referendum on the issue); and his opposition to the Welsh Government's Welsh language policies.

The 1966 version published by Sangsters is 244 pages long with an introduction by Rex Nettleford and includes a four-page glossary, as the poems are written mainly in Jamaican Patois. There are 128 poems in the book, and they tend to follow the ballad-quintrain style of writing. Nettleford says that \\"read at the proper pace the poem becomes almost a tongue-twister.\\" The poems are sectioned into four parts: \\"City Life\\", \\"War Time\\", \\"Politics\\" and \\"Jamaica ‚Äì Now An' Then\\". Every poem opens up with a small blurb as to what they are about, including historical insight and context. Significance, style and text The Oxford Living Dictionary Online says the term \\"labrish\\" most likely originated from the phrase \\"verbal blabber\\" but is defined literally as \\"gossip\\" - the origin of the word being West Indian. Jamaica Labrish is written in patois, which is defined as the ‚Äúdialect of the common people of a region, differing in various respects from the standard language of the rest of the country‚Äù. The online, Urban Dictionary-style website Jamaican Patwah defines labrish as ‚Äúgossip or chit-chat‚Äù. Rex Nettleford points out an important factor to keep in mind when looking at Louise Bennett‚Äôs work, specifically Jamaica Labrish ‚Äì that most of her work was meant to be performed. Introduction by Rex Nettleford In the 1966 publication of Jamaica Labrish, Nettleford's introduction describes Louise Bennett's work as \\"unique\\". The introduction explains and praises the nature of Bennett's art: Nettleford claims that ‚Äúas an artist she knows what is exactly the proof of the pudding and she makes the authenticity of her dialect verses speak for itself‚Äù. Nettleford mentions that there are other poets who do not necessarily view Bennett as a poet. He states: ‚Äúthere are others who would feel it is improper to endow her with the name of poet, though they would generously crown her as the leading entertainer in Jamaica‚Äôs comedy-lore, whether on stage, television or radio‚Äù. However, Nettleford also points out that Mervyn Morris describes Bennett as ‚Äúthe only poet who has really hit the truth about society through its own language‚Äù. In the last line of the first section of the introduction, Nettleford says that ‚Äúit is hoped that the volume will reveal Miss Bennett in her multiple roles as an entertainer, as a valid literary figure and as a documenter of aspects of Jamaican life, thought and feeling‚Äù. Criticism Mervyn Morris is one of the very few people who is considered a critic of Louise Bennett‚Äôs work. Nettleford says \\"Miss Bennett‚Äôs writing suffers from not having had a tradition of criticism. Mervyn Morris in his paper already referred to, has been the only person who has taken the trouble to discuss Miss Bennett‚Äôs work in detail and with commendable critical awareness.\\" Analayzing what this means, Nettleford goes on to say more on this: \\"The absence of more serious literary analysis is a commentary on the prevailing ignorance that envelops the subject of the Jamaican dialect.\\" The absence Nettleford speaks of pertains to how, mentioned before, there are people who do not take Bennett seriously as a poet. In his paper \\"Louise Bennett in Print\\", Morris disagrees with Nettleford saying that Jamaica Labrish is not the best example of Bennett‚Äôs writing because, as he says, ‚Äúalthough some aspects of her verse is clarified and/or enhanced in performance, there are others more fully appreciated by a reader savouring text.\\" He does not believe that there is an easy way to criticize Labrish through a literary lens: \\"Not enough is known about the language which she uses for us to be sure about what are 'the best of the others' though the rigid application of criteria born of a tradition of English literary criticism could, I daresay, disqualify a great many of the pieces.\\" Poems ‚ÄúGovanah‚Äù is a poem that discusses the year 1943 when the current governor of Jamaica, Sir Arthur Richards, was to be transferred. The blurb at the beginning of this poem in Labrish says that Richards was a \\"strong man who believed in the maintenance of law and order\\". Despite this, Richards \\"reputedly made many friends among Jamaicans\\" and was even partially responsible for the 1944 Constitution \\"introducing adult suffrage\\". The last part of the poem reflects the people of Jamaica‚Äôs thoughts on this and how in the future the constitution might need a \\"strong man like Richards to see it through\\". Bennett writes: \\"Ef is soh Jamaica changible, Doah me is a Jamaican, Me dah-trimble, for me narvas bout dis new Cons'itution\\". The poem reflects the people being nervous for how the new constitution will be written and amended. The poem following \\"Govanah\\" is one called \\"New Govanah\\", which discusses the time when Sir John Huggins replaced Sir Richards. The historical information at the beginning of this poem says, \\"If Richards was the pill, then Sir John Huggins was the sweet coating to cut the bitter taste.\\" Morris considers \\"New Govanah\\", the poem following \\"Govanah\\" to be one of the poems within Labrish, to be a \\"fine example of Miss Bennett‚Äôs ironic skills\\". The poem pins the governor up against the lack of agricultural products and money in Jamaica. It references things like white rice and a \\"t‚Äôree month war bonus\\" which is pay given to those whose husbands were currently deployed during a time of war, according to Morris, though he does not mention which war. White rice, at the time, was less available than brown rice. Since the poem is essentially taking the value of the governor and pinning it against the value of \\"commodities\\" in Jamaica, Morris points out that the governor is the white rice (literally because he is white) and \\"less available than the brown people\\". The poem \\"Duty Bound\\" is about governor Sir Hugh Foot and his wife leaving Jamaica. The historical blurb at the beginning of this poem describes it as a \\"farewell tribute to him\\". The people of Jamaica are sad that the Foots are leaving. Bennett writes: \\"De Govanah was popula! An dat is not noh lie, de whole Jamaica sad fe tell de Goavanah goodbye.\\" The line \\"Mix up wid we art an Drama; Teck een every line an word, you want hear govanah an him wife, hall(a) Chi Chi Bird\\" refers to an old Jamaican folk song called \\"Chi Chi Bud\\". Bud is the dialect for 'bird'. They do not sing the song in the correct dialect the folksong was written in. This poem is teasing the governor and his wife, but in a loving way, because of how much this governor was loved.

He made his major league debut on June 30, 2018, and has appeared at every position except shortstop in a major league game. Early life Willians Astudillo was born in Barcelona, Venezuela, located on the country's Caribbean coast. Astudillo's father, a professional baseball player in Venezuela, and his grandfather taught him from an early age how to play baseball. Drills included flicking corn kernel projectiles for the young Astudillo to hit with a broomstick. Career Philadelphia Phillies Astudillo signed his first professional baseball contract with the Philadelphia Phillies as an amateur free agent on December 15, 2008. In 2009, Astudillo played for the VSL Phillies. Midway through 2012, he was assigned to the GCL Phillies, and spent the 2013 season with the team as well. In 2014, he played for the Lakewood BlueClaws. In 2015, he was assigned to the Clearwater Threshers, where he would spend the season. On November 6, 2015, he elected free agency. Atlanta Braves On November 19, 2015, Astudillo signed a minor league deal with the Atlanta Braves. He spent the year with the minor league affiliate Mississippi Braves. He elected free agency on November 7, 2016. Arizona Diamondbacks On April 4, 2017, Astudillo signed a minor league deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks, and was assigned to the Reno Aces. He spent the year with the Aces and elected free agency on November 6, 2017. Minnesota Twins On November 30, 2017, Astudillo signed a minor league deal with the Minnesota Twins and was assigned to the Rochester Red Wings. Astudillo was called up to the majors for the first time on June 29, 2018.Willians Astudillo recalled after Twins place Taylor Motter on concussion DL He made his major league debut at Wrigley Field the following afternoon versus the Chicago Cubs as a defensive replacement in left field in the fifth inning, later switching to center field. In the sixth inning, he singled on a ground ball to second base to score Robbie Grossman for his first major league hit. On July 14, 2018, he made his major league pitching debut, completing the final inning of a 19‚Äì6 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays at Target Field. He allowed five runs on five hits and two home runs for a 45.00 earned run average (ERA) in his lone pitching entry of the season. Astudillo spent most of his playing time at catcher and third base and made other appearances at second base. He appeared in 30 games total for the Twins in 2018, batting .355, .371 on-base percentage, .516 slugging percentage, three home runs, 21 RBI, two walks and three strikeouts over 93 plate appearances. The Twins announced their selection of Astudillo for his first major league 25-man Opening Day roster on March 27, 2019, as one of five bench players. One month later, he was placed on the injured list with a left hamstring strain. He was batting .327 with two home runs. He ended the season hitting .268 in 58 games. He has also played for the Caribes de Anzo√°tegui in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League annually since the 2015‚Äì16 season. Known for an extremely high contact rate, Astudillo produced eight of the 30 lowest strikeout rates with a minimum of 100 plate appearances according to Baseball Prospectus' catalog of over 42,000 individual seasons from 2005‚Äì2018. He produced the lowest of all at 0.9% in Venezuela in 2011, second-lowest at 1.8% in Venezuela in 2010, and fourth- lowest at 2.4% in the Florida State League in 2015. On July 3, 2020, it was announced that Astudillo had tested positive for COVID-19. Playing style Several prevalent distinctions about Astudillo have helped create popularity with fans: his non-athletic build, multi-positional flexibility, and a highly aggressive batting style that yields few strikeouts or walks. Lacking obvious athleticism at tall and , his determination helped propel him to the major leagues. ‚ÄúAll my minor league career I heard I was not going to be a big leaguer because I did not 'look' like one. I was too short. I was too stocky. I did not have the physical traits customary associated with a Major League player,‚Äù he noted on Instagram. ‚ÄúWell here I am.‚Äù Combining his professional careers in both the American minor leagues and Venezuela, Astudillo has played at every position except shortstop. He then accomplished the same feat within his first two major league seasons. Twins chief baseball officer Derek Falvey commented that team scouts were perplexed by Astudillo as projection systems failed to find any closely comparable hitters, and were also amused when he informed them that he could play center field. To prove it, Astudillo played footage of himself robbing a home run in a Venezuelan winter league game. In an era notable for its rising strikeout rates and where high walk rates are prized, Astudillo's aggressive batting approach manifests a gestalt with an unusually low number of both. In his minor league career through the 2018 season, he had put the ball in play in 2,400 of 2,571 plate appearances.

His siblings included Benjamin Robert Winthrop, Jr.; Anna Neilson Winthrop, who married Horatio Greenough Curtis; and William Neilson Winthrop, who married Louise Van Zandt. His father inherited significant properties and was a noted philanthropist before his death in London in 1879. His maternal grandfather was William Neilson Coles. His paternal grandparents were Benjamin Winthrop, a descendant of Wait Winthrop and Joseph Dudley, and Judith (n√©e Stuyvesant) Winthrop, a direct descendant of Peter Stuyvesant, the Director-General of New Netherland, and Robert Livingston the Elder, the 1st Lord of Livingston Manor. His paternal aunt, Elizabeth Sheriffe Winthrop, was married to the Rev. Dr. John White Chanler and they were the parents of U.S. Representative John Winthrop Chanler, Egerton's first cousin who was married to Margaret Astor Ward, the daughter of Samuel Cutler Ward and granddaughter of William Backhouse Astor, Sr. Another aunt, Margaret Cornelia Winthrop, was married to George Folsom, the U.S. Charg√© d'affaires to the Netherlands.

He practiced law and served as a vice president of the Union Square Savings Bank and a trustee of the United States Trust Company and the Institute for Savings of Merchants' Clerks, until his retirement. Society life In 1892, the widowed Winthrop, along with his son Frederic and several members of his wife's family, was included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times.

On the second day of event finals she won bronze on balance beam behind Elena Gerasimova of Russia and Wei Xiaoyuan of China and placed seventh on floor exercise. In July DiCello competed at the U.S. Classic where uncharacteristic falls on the balance beam and floor exercise resulted in an eleventh place finish in the all-around. She won bronze on uneven bars behind Olivia Greaves and Sydney Morris and placed seventh on vault. In August DiCello competed at the U.S. National Championships. After the first day of competition she recorded a score of 56.000 and was in second behind Konnor McClain. During the second day of competition scored a 56.700, giving her a total combined score of 112.700 which was enough to win the gold in the all- around by one tenth over silver medalist McClain. This score would have placed her third all-around in the senior competition. Additionally DiCello won gold on vault and floor exercise, bronze on uneven bars behind Olivia Greaves and McClain, and placed fourth on balance beam behind McClain, Ciena Alipio, and Skye Blakely. At this competition, DiCello increased her floor difficulty by debuting a full-twisting double layout, or Chusovitina as her first tumbling pass.

He died on October 26, 1923, while resisting arrest during his own suicide bombing; the bomb killed seven officers.  Biography   Birth  Dhanna Singh was born in Behbalpur in the Hoshiarpur district of Punjab, India. He belonged to the Jatt caste. His father's name was Indar Singh, and he was born into a poor rural family. As a child, he learned Punjabi and Urdu at the village school.  Babbar Akali Movement  In his youth, Dhanna Singh was influenced by Karam Singh of Daulatpur, leader of the Chakravarti Jatha (Chakravarti means 'gypsy'). In March 1921 he helped organize the Jathas major divans at Mahalpur and then again in October 1921 at Kukkar Muzara. Dhanna Singh's associates included Banta Singh Dhamiyan, Karam Singh, and Udai Singh. Dhanna was assigned to murder Arjan Singh, a patwari (land record officer), who had caused the arrest of Master Mota Singh in June 1922. With the help of Buta Singh and Sadha Singh of Pandori Nijijhrari, he attempted to murder Arjan Singh. Dhanna Singh was also involved in the murders of Buta, lambardar of Narigal Shaman, Hazara Singh of Bahibalpur, and Labh Singh, a mistri (master craftsman) of Garhsharikar, who had Kishan Singh Gargajj arrested in February 1923. = Murder of Buta Singh = Dhanna Singh, Banta Singh from Dhamian, and Santa Singh were armed with pistols. Banta Singh had a bomb, and the rest had various bladed weapons. On reaching Buta Singh's house, Dhanna and Banta Singh scaled the wall of the courtyard. Buta Singh was in the courtyard and challenged them both. They jumped down from the wall. Buta Singh went to the roof of the house. The door was forced open by the two Babbars, and Dhanna Singh fired two shots at him. Buta Singh fell off the roof into an adjoining courtyard. Surjan Singh Chobara and Ram Singh (Ram Chand) were sleeping. Surjan Singh tried to plead for his life, but Dhanna struck him with his chhavi. = Murder of Hazara Singh = Near the end of March 1923, Hazara Singh, lambardar of Bebbalpur (Hoshiarpur), was murdered by Dhanna Singh. After killing Hazara Singh, he went to the police station to inform them through a poster that Hazara Singh of Behbalpur had been murdered by Dhanna Singh Babbar. = Murder of Labh Singh = Labh Singh, a mistri, was murdered by Dhanna Singh, Santa Singh, Banta Singh, and Dalipa Singh. Dhanna Singh borrowed a pony which was used to carry weaponry and Dalipa Singh. Kartar Singh was arrested for the murder on June 20, 1923.  Betrayal by Jwala  Jwala Singh was an informer for the British. After 18-year-old Daleep Singh and Jwala Singh were arrested, Dhanna Singh asked Jwala Singh about his arrest. Jwala Singh denied having anything to do with Daleep Singh's arrest. Jwala Singh told Dhanna Singh that the police were near and that he should hide outside the village in a sugar cane field. Dhanna Singh hid while Jwala Singh called Subinspector Gulzara Singh to tell him of Dhanna's Singh's whereabouts. Gulzara Singh thought it would be difficult to catch or kill Dhanna Singh in the sugar cane field so he asked Jwala Singh to invite Dhanna Singh into Jwala's house. Police Superintendent A.F. Harton of Hoshiarpur was informed of the plan. = Final confrontation = On October 25, 1923, Dhanna Singh stayed at Jwala Singh's house. Jwala Singh emptied Dhanna's guns while he was asleep. The police surrounded the house at night, and by the morning, there was a police group of 40 units. Jwala Singh managed to escape. Some sources say that when Dhanna Singh came out of the house, he was hit on the head by Gulzara Singh's lathi. Other sources say that while Dhanna Singh tried to slip away from the attack, he fell and was arrested and put into handcuffs, his feet into fetters, and had his revolver confiscated. The police mocked Dhanna Singh because he had sworn that nobody would be able to catch him alive. Dhanna Singh, with the force of his elbow, blew himself up with the explosives he was carrying. The blast killed seven people; five died on the spot. W.N.P. Jenkins (assistant superintendent) and Gulzara Singh died immediately. Thanedar and Horton were wounded. Horton died a few days later. A year after the blast, on October 23, 1924, Governor Malcolm Hailey raised a monument in memory of Horton and the six policemen who died.

History In 1872, Hans Gutzeit, a Norwegian, founded a sawmill in Kotka, which grew to be Stora Enso, which still operates. Gutzeit brought at least 200 sawmill workers from Norway, of which some brought their family as well. Many of them settled in Finland permanently, and established communities in the middle of Finnish rural regions. Mass migration was rare in Finland until this point. Norwegians had a significant impact in Kotka. In 1875 there were 130-140 Norwegians in Kotka, one sixth of the population. Norwegians also established communities in Oulu, and founded several sawmills across Finland. Norwegians had an notable presence in Kemi. The tenth Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari is a descendant of the sawmill workers. Finns had an hatred towards Norwegians, since they had a higher pay and a higher position in the society. Norwegians usually didn't pay taxes. In the 1920s and 1930s, most Norwegians acquired Finnish citizenship. In 1882, Norwegians started to be assimilated into the Finnish culture. However, Finns with Norwegian ancestry still retain their Norwegian identity. Demographics According to the International migrant stock: The 2017 revision, there were 2,156 Norwegian immigrants living in Finland. Most of them live in Helsinki, Oulu and Northern Finland. They make the most in Utsjoki (2.65%), Larsmo (0.77%) and Enonteki√∂ (0.69%). Of the Norwegian citizens, 58.8% are male. 337 Norwegian men are in a registered relationship with a Finnish woman. 45.4% of Norwegians are employed, 7.7% unemployed and 46.9% outside the labour force. Of the labour force, 85.6% are employed and 14.4% unemployed. There were 44 Norwegian entrepreneurs in 2017. Norwegian language in Finland The northernmost municipalities of Finland (Inari, Enonteki√∂ and Utsjoki) want to increase teaching of the Norwegian language in schools. The school curriculum however doesn't include Norwegian and it can only be learned as an optional subject. Enonteki√∂ tries to get Norwegian to be included in the school curriculum, since the inhabitants of Enonteki√∂ have many connections and bonds to Norway. In Ivalo ala-aste, 56 pupils learn Norwegian. Oulu considers making Norwegian one of the official languages. Norwegian can be learned several colleges.

Gameplay U-boat is a game where the player is on the German side during the dawn of World War II. The player's submarine patrols the North Sea and only returns to port to refuel. The player gets missions involving attacks on Allied ships. Commands are given in a small window on the lower half of the control panel screen. On the map view, courses are plotted, enemy ships are located, and the submarine is controlled. Reception Markus Dahlberg reviewed U-boat for Swedish magazine Datormagazin in 1994. Dahlberg enjoyed the atmosphere of the game, although he found parts of the game boring just like really being in a submarine. He found the graphics acceptable but was annoyed by changing windows to get new commands. He felt that players who have a lot of time and are interested in following orders and giving some tactical thinking would find U-boat to be a good investment.

Her crew underwent a 6-week ordeal before being rescued; only the master and eight crewmen survived. Construction Chulmleigh was built in 1938 by William Pickersgill & Sons Ltd. of Southwick for the Dulverton Steamship Co., one of WJ Tatem's companies, and was intended for the movement of general cargo. She was 430 ft in length, with a capacity of 5,445 GRT and powered by a triple-expansion steam engine fed by two single- ended boilers, giving a maximum speed of 10.5 knots. She had a single deck, with a shelter deck and a cruiser stern.

The daughter woke to hear the repeated stabbings to her brother and asked, \\"What are you doing?\\" In which, Brandi told her to \\"go back to sleep.\\" She then repeatedly stabbed her daughter. Finally Brandi called 9-1-1 to report the murders. She stated she took \\"a lot of Benadryl\\". She was calm and emotionless during the 911 call. She tells the 911 dispatcher that she has already called her mother and that her mother is on her way over. Her mother does not yet realize the events that took place. The 9-1-1 dispatcher, initially hoping or believing the call was not legitimate, asked Brandi Worley's mother, who was the victims' grandmother, to check on the welfare of the children. After the mother-in-law found the children dead, her screams caused Jason to rise out of bed. Brandi told Jason \\"Now you can't take the kids from me.\\" Police arrived around 4:30 A.M. Autopsies were conducted at Terre Haute Regional Hospital in Terre Haute, Indiana. Aftermath Brandi Worley initially was admitted to Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis to treat her self-inflicted injuries. The funeral of the victims was held at the Darlington Community Center on November 22, 2016, and they were buried at Greenlawn Cemetery in Darlington. A vigil was held at Congregational Christian Church, also in Darlington, on November 18, 2016. YouTuber Philip DeFranco assisted Jason Worley after the father of the victims contacted him on Reddit. DeFranco asked his viewers to contribute to a GoFundMe account to pay for Jason Worley's immediate cost of living and the funeral of the children. In March 2017 the divorce initiated by Jason Worley became final. Legal proceedings and sentence Brandi Worley was placed in the Montgomery County Jail in Crawfordsville while she awaited trial. Originally Brandi Worley pleaded not guilty and had a trial scheduled. In January 2018, Brandi Worley pleaded guilty to murder. On March 19, 2018, Judge Harry Siamas of the Montgomery Circuit Court sentenced Brandi Worley to 65 years for murdering Charlee and 55 years for murdering Tyler, giving her a consecutive total of 120 years in prison. Jason Worley stated \\"All I care is to never see [Brandi Worley] again. Out of sight and out of mind.\\" Brandi Worley, now in the Indiana Department of Corrections, is located in the Rockville Correctional Facility in Parke County, Indiana.\\"Brandi Worley.\\" Indiana Department of Corrections.

This was the first album with former Broadcaster guitarist Jesse Litwa replacing the late Rob McAllister on guitar.https://www.avclub.com/here-are-6-new-albums-you-should-know-about- this-week-1819317825 Background Following the touring for The Constant One in 2015, the band parted ways with guitarist Rob McAllister. Mattie Jo Canino of Latterman, RVIVR and Tender Defender filled in temporarily before Broadcaster guitarist Jesse Litwa assumed the role permanently shortly thereafter. Upon reconvening to begin writing sessions for the album- the band was informed that former guitarist Rob McAllister had died. This, coupled with singer Jason Lubrano's divorce informed the writing for the album. On the writing of the album, Lubrano explained, \\"When we write music, it takes a little while for us to congeal our songs and ideas into a record. It wasn‚Äôt really until we were almost done with the record that that was really super apparent to us, but I think we just felt like it was right to be that way. It would have been too much if it was super dark musically or heavy or whatever. It might be a little bit too much to take in. This was sort of like the honey with the medicine.\\" The band released a music video for \\"My Best Friend (Is A Nihilist)\\" On October 10, 2017 the band premiered \\"Planes, Chest Pains & Automobiles\\" via NPR. Reception The album received critical acclaim upon release. New Noise gave the album a glowing review citing that \\"the themes of You Can‚Äôt Stay Here are undoubtedly dark, yes, but the externalization of them ‚Äî casting them into light and setting them to a fierce, determined melody ‚Äî is a cry for survival and perseverance. This album is a tribute to fortitude, not weakness. Iron Chic has been through one hell of a fucking year, but they‚Äôre still standing, and they made this record together.\\" Bad Copy wrote of the album \\"From beginning to end, every second of this album kept my attention in the same way a roller coaster might. There were natural feelings of euphoria that quickly dipped into realizations of my own mortality. When it was all said and done, however, I couldn‚Äôt believe it was over.\\" Exclaim! acknowledged the existentialism on the album stating \\"There's not a ton of hope to be found on You Can't Stay Here; with any sort of personal tragedy, it takes time to make sense of it.

The main goal of pre-editing is to reduce the post-editing workload by adapting the source document to improve the raw output of the machine translation. Pre-editing could be also valuable for human translation projects since it can increase the application of the translation memory. In general, pre-editing is worth to apply when there are more than three target languages. In this case, pre-editing should facilitate the process of machine translation by spell and grammar checking, avoiding complex or ambiguous syntactic structure, and verifying term consistency.

It is more complex than a conventional transformer operating at utility frequency, but it can be smaller and more efficient than a conventional transformer because it operates at high frequency. The main types are \\"true\\" AC-to-AC converter (with no DC stages) and AC-to-DC-to-DC-to-AC converter (in which an active rectifier supplies power to a DC-to-DC converter, which supplies power to a power inverter). A solid-state transformer usually contains a transformer, inside the AC-to-AC converter or DC-to-DC converter, which provides electrical isolation and carries the full power. This transformer is smaller due to smaller DC-DC inverting stages between transformer coils, which consequently mean smaller transformer coils required to step up or step down voltages. A solid-state transformer can actively regulate voltage and current. Some can convert single-phase power to three-phase power and vice versa. Variations can input or output DC power to reduce the number of conversions, for greater end-to-end efficiency. As a complex electronic circuit, it must be designed to withstand lightning and other surges. Solid-state transformer is an emerging technology.

The movement had been founded by him and seven others and registered with the one day before Harkimo's resignation from the NCP. The seven founding members are Harkimo, former SDP party secretary Mikael Jungner, , Helene Auramo, Karoliina K√§h√∂nen, Sarian Antila, and Tuomas Enbuske.

In the 2019 Finnish parliamentary election, Harkimo was elected to the parliament as the sole representative from Movement Now. 115 candidates stood for election, short of the movement's target of 150. Besides Harkimo, candidates included another founder of the party Auramo, and the former's Mirita Saxberg. Because the movement was not a registered party, each of its candidates had to gather signatures of at least 100 voters to form a . The party used controversial microtargeting in its campaign advertising.

Construction and specifications The three boats were originally part of a larger class of eight vessels. The entire class was built at the Thames Iron Works in the United Kingdom between 1906 and 1907. Each boat measured 30 meters in length, with a beam of 4 meters and a draught of 0.8 meters. Normal displacement amounted to 45 tons, growing to 51 tons for a full load. Power plant consisted of two compound engines powering two shafts, generating 550 hp which resulted in a top speed of 18 knots. Each vessel could carry up to 7.6 tons of fuel. With a full complement of 20, each of the boats was armed with one 47 mm Skoda gun, one 6.5 mm Maxim machine gun and two spar torpedoes, as well as torpedo dropping gear amidships. The sides and deck were protected by bulletproof armor.Robert Gardiner, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906‚Äì1921, Naval Institute Press, 1985, p. 422 The thickness of their armor is not known, however it is known that during World War II the Germans used 20 mm-thick plates of armor to proof their landing craft against British 0.303 inches (~8 mm) caliber machine gun rounds,Robert Forczyk, We March Against England: Operation Sea Lion, 1940‚Äì41, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2016, p. 300 meaning that the armor of the Romanian vessels must have been around the same thickness. Career Initially, the 8 vessels were classed as river torpedo boats, and served as such during the First World War. One boat was mined and sunk at the end of 1916. Ultimately, only three boats survived the Second World War. During their service, they showed considerable seaworthiness, as shown by their inclusion in the Soviet Black Sea Fleet in August 1944, instead of the Danube Flotilla (they would be returned to Romania in September 1945).Robert Gardiner, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906‚Äì1921, Naval Institute Press, 1985, p. 422 This seaworthiness was also exploited by the Romanians, who fitted each of the three boats with one 300 mm depth charge thrower after the start of the Second World War.

Ediciones GEO, Havana 2011 - is a Cuban village and consejo popular (\\"people's council\\", i.e. hamlet) of the municipality of Chambas, in Ciego de √Åvila Province. In 2011 it had a population of about 8,789. History Founded in 1912 as the hacienda Nauy√∫s y Cacarratas, owned by Pepe Planas, a man linked to Falla- Guti√©rrez sugar company. After his death (shot by unknown), the Laureano Falla-Guti√©rrez Association, which would extend it for the delivery of land made by the President of the Republic, Alfredo Zayas, is in charge of the hacienda. The concession of the latifundium extended the sugarcane monoculture in the area and, with it, the development of the current urban settlement. After the Cuban Revolution, and following the creation of \\"people's councils\\" (consejos populares), the one of Falla was named Enrique Varona after Enrique Varona Gonz√°lez, a Cuban trade union leader and socialist killed in 1920. Geography Located on a rural plain, southwest of Laguna de Leche (9 km far) and south of the Bay of Buena Vista (28 km from Punta San Juan), Falla spans across the state highway \\"Circuito Norte\\" and the railway. The western old settlement develops around the sugar factory, the eastern new area grows mainly to the north of the train station. The village is 15 km from Tamarindo, 17 from Chambas, 18 from Mor√≥n, 24 from Ciro Redondo, 28 from Florencia, 41 from Ciego de √Åvila and 81 from Cayo Coco. Nearest settlements are the villages El Calvario (6 km west) and Ranchuelo (7 km east). Economy The main economic activity is represented by the sugar industry. The sugar refinery \\"Enrique Varona\\" (Central Azucarero Enrique Varona Gonz√°les), founded in 1915 as Central Adelaida, is a large complex with its own industrial railway line.

Two firefighters were killed when a fire developed and spread from the 9th floor. The investigations and inquiries following the fire led to changes in fire safety rules nationally, particularly the regulations around electrical wiring. Background Shirley Towers is a 15-storey concrete tower block of 150 apartments located in the Shirley area of Southampton and is home to about 400 people. The building dates from the mid-1960s and is of the unusual scissor section construction where each apartment is spread over several floors in an interlocking design.  The fire  The fire started when curtains in the lounge of the flat caught fire from being on top of an uplighter lamp (light fitting.) Emergency crews were called at 20:10 on 6 April 2010. The fire response teams were confused by the complex layout of the building and of the flat itself. The flat was very smoky with zero visibility and firefighters did not locate the fire in the lounge. The flat rapidly became very hot - more than 1,000¬∞C. The firefighters tried to escape through the flat's fire exit on the 11th floor. Two firefighters mangaged to escape but needed hospital treatment for burns. Firefighters James Shears and Alan Bannon were overcome by sudden exposure to intense heat and died at the top landing of the flat. The escaping firefighters got tangled in cables that fell from the roof, both inside and outside the flat, after the heat from the fire melted the plastic trunking they were contained in.  Inquest and Inquiry  The Coroner's inquest highlighted the \\"extremely difficult and dangerous\\" conditions in the fire, but noted that \\"numerous factors\\" led to the eventual tragedy which could be addressed to stop a similar future tragedy. After the inquest the coroner issued a \\"Rule 43 letter.\\" This is a letter to other statutory authorities designed to prevent future deaths. The Rule 43 letter made nine recommendations to the Government and fire services. These included: * Improved training for firefighters. * Changing building regulations to ensure fire resistant cable supports. * Fitting of sprinklers to existing residential buildings over 30 metres tall. * Improved escape signage. Changes to the British Standards electrical wiring regulations finally came into force in July 2015 following the Shirley Towers tragedy, and the previous Harrow Court fire, where similar problems were a factor in firefighter deaths.

The site is in the Lowther Hills above the Mennock Pass, a mile south of Leadhills in the Southern Uplands. This is the only remaining original water powered beam engine in the United Kingdom and still stands at its original location. It ceased working circa 1910 after installation circa 1870. It is a Scheduled Industrial Monument (SM90310), considered to be of national importance and the principles by which it functioned were originally derived from attempts at producing a perpetual motion machine. History The water-bucket pumping engine and Straitsteps miners cottages Similar water powered water pumping engines are known from as early as 1745 and an example in the 1790s is known to have been used to drain a coal mine at Canonbie, Dumfries and Galloway. They were progressively replaced by steam powered water pumps such as the 1780s example once at Earlston in East Ayrshire and now preserved in the National Museum of Scotland. Sir James Stampfield installed hand rag-pumps that were used manually at the Straitsteps Mine between 1675 and 1684, water being drawn up by rags attached to a continuous length of rope inside a pipe that opened below the water level. Later on water power was used to work drainage pumps and then two waterwheel-powered pumping engines, known as ‚Äòbab-gins‚Äô were installed at Straitsteps in 1710. By 1779 the Straitsteps mine that ran under Wanlock Dod was drained using a Boulton & Watt steam pumping engine, later replaced by a more economic and efficient Watt engine. From 1870 until circa 1910 the Wanlockhead beam engine water pump is thought to have acted as a supplementary pump for draining water from the disused parts of Straitsteps lead mine that had first been worked as far back as 1675 and in doing so prevented the flooding of the near by Bay Lead Mine. Traditional lead mining ceased in 1928 however lead and zinc extraction from the settling ponds only ended in 1968. The Beam engine The beam, pivot and bearings. The horizontal circa 8.5 m (27 ft) long pitch-pine beam pivots on cast-iron step plummer blocks with brass bearings and a wrought iron axle. The blocks are secured to the pillar by metal tie rods which pass right through the stone column and are tied in at the base. The aforementioned supporting column is 14 ft high and built from well dressed freestone ashlar block masonry. Two baulks of pitch pine are held together by wrought iron straps and reinforcing pads are located at the centre and beam ends. The stone column has a decoratively carved cornice and has the general appearance of a typical 19th century railway bridge pier. A number of small locking screws can be seen and the brass bearings were clearly turned on a lathe. Wedges and cotter pins are used to hold some parts of the mechanism together. The machining of the bearings, etc confirms the late 19th century construction of the beam engine. The wooden parts of the structure have been replaced over the years however remains of ladders, platforms and the rest of the pumping rod may remain within the capped mine shaft. The wooden bucket on the eastern end of the beam has long since rotted however the 2m deep stone lined pit, once draining into the Wanlock Burn, still survives. The prominent wooden tripod frame with a ladder was used for maintenance of the pump rod and for adjusting or trimming the weight of the pumping rod end of the beam using smelted lead bars. This is a more recent replacement feature. The lead tank or cistern that formed the head of water once stood on the hill above the site and was fed by a launder from the Wanlock Burn. The stone column of another beam engine is recorded at the Bay Mine (NS868137) as well as the wheel pit of a sizable waterwheel. It is thought that the stone column is part of the atmospheric beam engine built by William Symington. It is possible that the Straitsteps beam engine had been used elsewhere before being assembled at Straitsteps. Operation Detail of the pumping gear on the bucket end of the beam. The ongoing running costs were minimal as the only 'fuel' was free in the form of water and therefore construction costs were the only significant outlay. Water was fed into a lead tank or cistern above the beam engine from the Wanlock Water and then passed under the road to the square bucket that was attached to the eastern end of the wooden beam via wrought iron pumping mechanism. The weight of the water would eventually overcome the weight of the pumping rod attached to the western end of the beam and the upward movement would draw water up via flap valves at the rate of two to three oscillations a minute and lift around 7000 litres per hour that was released back into the Wanlock Water via a wood-lined culvert which ran underground. The water within the bucket was likewise released via a valve that was activated when the stroke reached its maximum and then the cycle was repeated. This simple operation was very reliable and ran 24 hours a day with minimum attention or maintenance. A working model of the water-bucket pumping-engine is on display within the lead mining museum's exhibition area. The characteristic nodding motion of the beam engine gave rise to the 'Bobbin John' nickname coined by the miners. In front of the beam engine a double circle walkway indicates where a horse gin once stood, predating the beam engine and once used to haul miners and ore from the mine. Straitsteps and the miners cottages A number of the original single storey miners cottages are still in use or are preserved by the Museum of Scottish Lead Mining and a semi-detached example, East and West Straitsteps Cottages, stand above the beam engine site. The name 'Straitsteps' refers to a barren section between Straitsteps and the Bay Mine of the galena vein that runs from Mennockhass through the Dod Hill and on to the Limpen Rig.

Only one was completed before the outbreak of World War II. Design and development Though J√≥zef Medwecki and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kiryluk were employed by P.W.S, they designed and built the Medwecki M9 in their own time. Begun in 1937, it was a product of the 1930s revival of amateur aircraft design in Poland and perhaps the last to fly before the German invasion of Poland in September 1939. With funding from LOPP and some aircraft companies, Medwecki, Kiryluk and friends built the M9 in the P.W.S. workshops. The M9 was of mixed construction. Its constant thickness high wing had a rectangular plan apart from blunted tips. The wing was a wooden structure in two parts, had two spars and was plywood-covered ahead of the forward spar with fabric covering elsewhere. A pair of parallel steel tube struts on each side braced the wing to the lower fuselage. Its ailerons were of the Frise type. It was powered by a Cirrus III upright 4-cylinder air-cooled inline engine with its fuel tanks in the wings. The M9's fuselage was built around a triangular section frame of steel tubes, the nose metal covered and the rest with fabric covering over a light wooden frame giving it an oval section. Its enclosed cabin was under the wing, with its windscreen just ahead of the leading edge. There were two seats in tandem, each with a starboard-side door and dual controls, and a luggage compartment behind the cabin. The horizontal tail of the M9, mounted on top of the fuselage, was straight-tapered with rounded tips and the fin was also straight-tapered. It carried a full, rounded rudder which reached down to the keel through a gap between the elevators. The cantilever empennage had a wooden structure with plywood covered fixed surfaces and fabric covered control surfaces. The M9 had fixed, tailskid landing gear with tall, streamlined cantilever legs containing compressed-rubber shock absorbers and mounting wheels enclosed within spats. It was flown for the first time by Stefan Hanschild in early August 1939. Tests showed the M9 had excellent and docile handling characteristics suiting it to both touring and training roles. The Silesian Aeroclub offered to buy the prototype when its tests were complete and plans were made for production of M9s with a range of more powerful engines and a wing set with light dihedral but these hopes were overtaken by the German invasion.

Career  He made his debut in Turin, in 1898, presenting the sculptural group Le spose del Ligure. He moved to Rome in 1900 and in 1902 he was among the artists who announced themselves in the guidelines of the magazine \\"Novissima\\". Prini, a sensitive interpreter of the child's soul, sculpted groups of children who expressed great melancholy; images of a sad childhood that seemed burdened by a cruel fate. In this period he started the collaboration with Manifattura di Signa, for the production of ceramic sculptures, with children. In 1905 he exhibited, in a personal room of the Society of Amateurs and Cultori of Rome, sketches for the monuments of Dante and Wagner, charcoal drawings, bronzes with figures of children and oil on paper Innamorati on a bench. He later opened up to social themes, influenced by Giovanni Cena. He tackled work themes and illustrated covers for the weekly \\"Avanti della Domenica\\". His bronze of 1907, entitled The Blacksmith, entered the Quirinale collections. He was a popular and recognized artist when he created, in 1911, the bas-relief The artist and the artistic battles which is in Rome, in front of the National Gallery of Modern and Contemporary Art. It evokes the grandeur of Michelangelo, with suggestions of classical Greek art. For an exhibition in Castel Sant'Angelo, Prini rebuilt in a plastic form historical parades, drawn from ancient engravings. Prini carved commissioned monuments, friezes of public buildings, portals, sepulchral chapels, statues, fountains. He created the bronze group of the baptismal font in the church of Sant'Eugenio, in Rome, and the \\"Piet√†\\" that is in the crypt of Church of the Divine Wisdom, of the University of Rome \\"La Sapienza\\". In Sanremo he carved a luminous fountain dedicated to Mussolini, later destroyed. In 1923, he exhibited in Monza statues to decorate fountains, terracotta, colored statues and, with Vittorio Grassi, furnished the Music Room. At the Venice Biennale of 1930 he exhibited bronze statuettes in the jewellery section later n the hall of the Quadrennial of Rome, of 1948. His sculpture Ritratto di bimba is at the National Gallery of Modern Art in Rome. At the Vatican Museums (Collection of modern religious art) is preserved Anna , a bronze of 1939. Personal life He married Orazia Belsito, poet and painter, who opened Prini's home-studio, on Via Nomentana, to a select group of friends, intellectuals and artists, including Umberto Boccioni, the writer Sibilla Aleramo, the journalist/writer Giovanni Cena, Gino Severini, Duilio Cambellotti, the sculptor Ettore Ximenes and symbolist poet Sergio Corazzini.

It stars Tessa Thompson, Lily James, Luke Kirby, James Badge Dale and Lance Reddick. The plot focuses on sisters Ollie (Thompson) and Deb (James) who find themselves falling into the illegal world of the cross-border drug trade along the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border after their mother dies. The film had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, 2018, and was released on April 19, 2019 by Neon. Plot Ollie Hale is on probation after being caught illegally crossing the border between North Dakota and Canada. She is determined to reinvent her life and with eight days left on probation she has applied to find work in Spokane. Numerous opportunities to go back to her old way of life, including selling prescription medicine illegally and doing more work at the border, keep presenting themselves though Ollie scrapes by doing odd jobs for the construction workers who work nearby. Ollie's sister Deb, who has become semi- estranged since their mother's illness and death, discovers she is pregnant and turns to Ollie for help. Deb is already a single mother to her son Johnny and is living in an illegally parked trailer. Ollie offers to sign over the title of their mother's house to Deb, however the house is due to be foreclosed on. Ollie manages to negotiate down the down payment to prevent the foreclosure but the amount of money needed seems insurmountable to the sisters. Ollie is nevertheless determined to ensure that Deb is alright before she leaves. Reluctantly Ollie returns to the woods to retrieve a bag of 500 pills she hid there before crossing, intending to sell them in a week to prevent foreclosure on the house. At her job interview for the Spokane job, Ollie is attacked by Bill, a local drug dealer angry she is infringing on his territory. He offers her a choice between giving him a 30 percent cut of her sales or crossing the border for him again. She decides to cut him in, rather than take on the riskier work of crossing the border. After learning that going through with her pregnancy will cost her upwards of $8000, Deb decides to have an abortion. After learning that the only legal clinic is hundreds of miles away, she obtains the name of a local illegal abortion provider. The night Deb is scheduled to go for her abortion, the trailer she lives in is towed away along with the rest of the pills and all of the money for the foreclosure which Ollie had been keeping there to hide from her probation officer. After learning that the trailer wasn't even registered in Deb's name Ollie breaks into the pound where she discovers the trailer has already been raided and all the money and drugs are gone. After learning that Deb wants to have an abortion, Ollie decides to agree to Bill's drug run to Canada in exchange for enough money to secure the house, and determines to take Deb across with her so she'll be able to have a safe and clean abortion. Though Deb has difficulty obtaining a fake Manitoba ID card she is able to steal one. The crossing is successful and Ollie picks up the drugs while Deb is able to have an abortion. While waiting for Deb to come out of the clinic Ollie learns that the Spokane job is hers. The sisters spend the night in Canada and Ollie tells Deb she is leaving and that Deb will be fine without her. The next morning they cross back into the U.S. Cast Production In January 2017, it was announced Tessa Thompson, Lily James, Luke Kirby, James Badge Dale and Lance Reddick joined the cast of the film, with Nia DaCosta directing from a screenplay she wrote.

It had its world premiere at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival, in the Platform program.\\"TIFF 2018: Nicole Kidman, Elisabeth Moss films to compete for Platform Prize\\". Now, August 8, 2018. It was released on February 15, 2019, by IFC Films. Plot Jarhead Earl is a former US Marine living with a wife and two kids in a trailer park. Known as a tough guy, he seeks to leave his surroundings in favor of a fresh start for his family, and the only way he sees an out is by winning the Donnybrook, a massive bare-knuckle fight. Earl robs a local gun shop for the money to enter the contest and returns home, encountering Chainsaw Angus (Frank Grillo), a psychotic meth dealer to whom Earl's wife owes money. After a brief struggle, Angus leaves, driven by his sister/accomplice Delia (Margaret Qualley). Earl takes his family and flees the trailer park for the Donnybrook. Angus and Delia return to their cookhouse and see it up in flames. After killing their cooker who escaped the fire, they pay a visit to their partner, Eldon (Pat Healy) seeking money to restart their operation. When he refuses, Angus orders Delia to kill him. She does, but has sex with Eldon first; while doing so, Eldon tells Delia that she should kill Angus instead. Delia kills Eldon, but continues to be abused and belittled by Angus. Eventually, Delia is driven to contemplate suicide, but relents, instead going to Angus and shooting him. Overhearing Earl's plans to enter the Donnybrook earlier, she takes a stash of meth and sets out for the Donnybrook as well. However, Angus is not dead, and after killing an innocent for his car, he vows to find his sister and his meth. Meanwhile, Whalen, a local cop with a drinking problem, is investigating the gun shop robbery as well as the fire at the cookhouse. Running into his ex-girlfriend, she tells him about Angus. Whalen makes taking down Angus his personal mission, finally confronting him in a parking lot. The two men shoot at each other with shotguns. Angus fatally wounds Whalen and leaves him for dead. Angus tracks down Earl's son and kills him. He arrives at the site of the Donnybrook, sneaks up on Delia, and drags her into the woods where he strangles her to death. The Donnybrook begins in a chain link cage as a no holds barred melee. After a few minutes of fighting, Earl and Angus are the last fighters standing. They are given a break before they face off against each other. Angus uses the break to tell Earl that he killed his son. Back in the cage, Earl eventually manages to overpower Angus, shouting \\"You killed my boy!\\" as he breaks Angus' neck.

This includes participating in the 1988 Moscow summit meeting between President Reagan and President Mikhail Gorbachev, during the former's first visit to the USSR. He also served as ambassador to the Republic of Moldova, U.S. Special Negotiator for Eurasian Conflicts in the former Soviet Union (an ambassador-level position), Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Canadian Affairs in the State Department, director of European and Soviet Affairs for the U.S. National Security Council, and was on the policy planning staff of the State Department under Colin Powell before and after the invasion of Iraq. Following his retirement from the foreign service, Perina served as Charg√© d‚ÄôAffaires at U.S. embassies including those in Chisinau, Moldova (2006), Yerevan, Armenia (2007), Reykjavik (2010), Prague (2013), and Bratislava, Slovakia (2015). Early life and family Perina was born on January 3, 1945 in the town of T√°bor in what is today the Czech Republic. His father's family owned a large lumbermill serving Central Europe. His mother's family was subject to Nazi reprisals during World War II, including the execution of his grandfather and great uncle on June 10, 1942. The family members were executed in a coordinated purge of Czech nationalists and public figures that culminated in the razing of the town of Lidice. Perina and his parents fled Czechoslovakia following the 1948 Communist takeover of the government. Rudolf's mother paid a Croat border smuggler to transport her son in January 1950 to the border into Austria and eventually to Zurich where his father had escaped. The family lived as refugees in Switzerland and Morocco before immigrating to the United States via Le Havre, France in 1951. He grew up speaking Czech at home. In 1955, the family moved to Cleveland and Perina obtained US citizenship the following year. Education After the family moved to Seattle, Perina attended Franklin High School where he graduated as the valedictorian in 1963. He chose the University of Chicago as it offered him full tuition with a stipend. He earned his B.A. degree in history there in 1967 and did his graduate studies at Columbia University where he received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in European history, with the idea of going into academia. While studying in New York, he was hired by a film production company to consult and interpret for the filming of a documentary about the 1968 reform movement in Czechoslovakia known as the \\"Prague Spring\\". This led to the topic of his Ph.D dissertation: \\"Intellectuals and Political Change in Czechoslovakia: A History of Literarni noviny and its Contributors, 1952-1969.\\" He had also earned a Foreign Area Fellowship to research his dissertation at the library of Radio Free Europe for two years. Perina was at Columbia during the 1968 student protests. While supportive of the US civil rights movement and against the Vietnam War, he maintained a moderate political position, saying later \\"I became suspicious of all political extremism and radicalism, whether right- wing or left-wing. It is a position I have held all of my life.\\" Career Returning from Europe to finish his dissertation, Perina found that there were few academic jobs available in the U.S. He saw an ad for the foreign service exam and encouraged by the example of foreign-born Henry Kissinger, he took it and passed. Delighted to find that it paid better than any academic job, he started in November 1974, his first posting at the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa, Canada, through 1976 during which time both of his daughters were born. At this post, Perina gave Russian author Alexander Solzhenitsyn his first US visa, whereby he communicated to him in German. (Already fluent in Czech and French, Perina became fluent in Russian later.) He found that the author of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich and other works \\"took the process more seriously than almost any other applicant\\" he had processed up to that time. In reflecting on Solzhenitsyn's conscientiousness later, Perina concluded that \\"if you spend your life fighting a bureaucracy, your first thought is to not make a mistake in an official document that the bureaucracy can use against you.\\" At Ottawa, Perina also had responsibilities in the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) whose Helsinki Final Act was signed by the 35 participating states in the summer of 1975. Moscow He was then posted to Moscow, and was there during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Upon witnessing the confrontation with 1st Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Korniyenko, he said later he was \\"shown for the first time how unashamedly people can lie in diplomacy.\\" The US response to the invasion was tough, and included suspending exchanges, diplomatic social events, wheat sales, and eventually boycotting the Moscow Olympics, bringing Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and part of Eastern Europe along as well. Of the time, Perina has said, \\"our relations with the Soviets there were very competitive. We were always watching what they did, and they watched us.\\" Although compared to average Soviet citizen, he lived better, Perina has described that life in the Soviet capital \\"could be difficult\\". During the harsh winters, he had to remove his car battery each night to prevent its freezing. The Perinas also saw first hand the psychological warfare the KGB enacted on US embassy personnel, Perina describing his wife Ethel's coat disappearing for several months then reappearing in their closet. West Berlin He then started to work at the U.S. Mission in West Berlin in 1981. The US saw East Berlin differently from the GDR. Considered a Soviet zone, the Americans maintained another embassy in East Berlin, and the mission in West Berlin avoided dealing with the East Germans by going to the Soviets for things related to them. (The Soviets on the other hand respected the city as part of the GDR and the capital of East Germany.) Perina also described that in Berlin in 1981 it was so easy for the four occupying powers, which included the UK and France, plus East and West Germany, to spy on each other being in such close proximities that \\"the city with more espionage going on per square mile than any other city in Europe.\\" He said that \\"There was a lot of eavesdropping.\\" As liaison with the Soviets on Russian matters, Perina said that \\"Nobody seriously thought there was going to be a World War III or an invasion of Berlin by the Warsaw Pact.\\" The diplomat also never got the sense things were loosening up in the USSR. Although he personally did not know whether the Strategic Defense Initiative system (SDIs) would even work, he understood that the Soviets were threatened by the possibility: He said, \\"They realized their strength as a world power came from possession of nuclear weapons, and not from their GDP or anything else.\\" (There was talk too in Germany about NATO deployment of immediate range nuclear missiles.) Perina served as interpreter between ambassadors Arthur Burns and Piotr Abrassimov, then Vyacheslav Kochemasov during their twice yearly social lunches. There was bureaucratic protocol too that had to be observed whenever the West German president came to Berlin‚Äîthe US, French, and British embassies had to greet him formally‚Äîwhich Perina described as a \\"real nuisance\\". He also witnessed the tensions in Poland: The country was moving toward martial law, and Perina describes that by the end of his time there, he and his colleagues were witnessing six or seven Polish plane hijacking to West Berlin a year. He also saw the rivalry between the two Germanies, but felt the real threat at the time was from radical groups like the Baader-Meinhof gang. Brussels and the 1988 Moscow Summit Perina then worked at the U.S. Mission to NATO in Brussels from 1985, as political officer and deputy US representative to the organization's political committee. The group was handling three simultaneous negotiations, on Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), and SDIs for a number of visits by President Reagan to the North Atlantic Council, according to Perina, \\"the most comprehensive arms control discussion between the US and the Soviet Union.\\" The diplomat's impression of NATO was that it was an American-run organization, with the allies all deferring to the US. From 1987 to 1989, Perina was director for European and Soviet Affairs on the National Security Council staff: prior to his arrival there had been a purge from the Iran Contra scandal. He was brought in by Colin Powell who'd been hired by new National Security Council Advisor Frank Carlucci who ran the department differently, and better, in Perina's opinion. Perina had the Soviet portfolio, which included working on Reagan's \\"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall\\" speech. Yet even with this, the Czech-American had no suspicion that the empire was on the verge of collapse, saying \\"it was not even part of any discussion.... We were all watching the top, the Kremlin .... [W]e did not pay enough attention to the internal situation and particularly to the nationality issues.\\" In preparation for the 1988 meeting between the two world leaders, Perina asked the CIA to make a film for Reagan about the Moscow sites the president would be visiting and organized a lunch for him with Soviet experts in the US: It would be Reagan's first visit to the USSR. Perina attended the 1988 Moscow summit meeting between Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev, the third of only four total people; he later described the tension between the two principals being rooted in different negotiating styles: The Soviet's being deductive and the American's inductive. And although he found the American president very gracious, Perina found the leader of the USSR the more important historical figure \\"among the most important of our time.\\" He described the former Hollywood actor as having \\"good instincts\\" but that he \\"clearly did not have the grasp of substance that Gorbachev had.\\" Perina believed the summit was significant symbolically, that it influenced Reagan, the Russian people's opinion on Reagan, and changed the dynamics of the US- Russia relationship. Perina was also in charge of the NSC's Eastern European portfolio and visited Romania under Nikolai Ceausescu. He described it as a \\"desperate place\\" where there was no heat or electricity, and hardly any food in its stores. He said he could see clearly \\"the fear everyone so clearly had in their eyes,\\" even those around the Rleader himself. Perina left the NSC in spring 1989 when President Bush and Brent Scowcroft instituted a complete shift in personnel for political reasons. Vienna, Belgrade & the Dayton Accord From 1989 to 1992, Perina was deputy chairman of the U.S. Delegation to the Vienna negotiations on Confidence and Security Building Measures in Europe (CSBM), held under auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). From 1993 to 1996, he was Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade, Serbia with the title of Charge d‚ÄôAffaires and worked with a downsized staff. The country was under UN sanctions, and extreme inflation had forced the country to depend on the black market. Embassy matters were all handled on a cash basis: Perina describes having tens of thousands of dollars driven in from Budapest, Hungary in an unguarded car so as not to arouse suspicion from the gangs who then ruled the streets. Perina worked with Richard Holbrooke as liaison to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic during the negotiations to end the Yugoslav conflict. (Some considered Holbrooke's work to have merited the Nobel Peace Prize later.) They had a dozen meetings with the Serbian ruler with others around, then met him one on one because they found him more engaging in that capacity. Perina saw a \\"genuine lack of compassion that was truly frightening\\" and said that this feeling extended to his treatment of his countrymen, the Serbs. Perina also participated in the talks held in Dayton, Ohio, to which he credits Milosevic's assent, although mostly for self-serving purposes: The leader thought he would gain respectability in the international community and sanctions would be lifted. Perina also met with Ibrahim Rugova, the elected president of the Republic of Kosovo, whom along with Macedonia's Kiro Gligorov Perina found to be the most impressive leaders in the former Yugoslavia. Perina served as Senior Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs; in 1996-97 the majority of his time was spent helping to execute the Dayton Accords from Washington DC while John Kornblum travelled to implement them. This included the outer wall of sanctions that enraged the Serbs and did not satisfy Kosovar Albanians (They would form the Kosovo Liberation Army.) As the former USSR was now handled by the Office of Newly Independent States (NIS) and not the European bureau, the other third of Perina's time was spent on helping to expand NATO, which he said he felt ambivalence towards: The powerful organization did not help integrate the Russians into Europe and damaged the US's relationship to Russia. He has said \\"I fear the way we handled revanchism made it a self-fulfulling prophecy.\\" He saw and was shocked by Sarajevo at the end of the war, which described as \\"miles and miles of just rubble.\\" Perina has said European and Canadian Affairs was one of his least favorite because it was so bureaucratic and based in the US capital. Moldova  Perina was assigned and confirmed ambassadorship to the Republic of Moldova, serving from 1998 to 2001. He studied Romanian and reviewed his Russian before starting and found the former Soviet republic \\"a much more pleasant place\\" than he had imagined: \\"The people were extremely friendly and hospitable, and the country was a very interesting place to work.\\" His job was to help it develop into a successful, autonomous nation. It was one of the earliest to privatize land, helped by a major USAID project that completed under Perina: The US gave over $50 million in assistance, the third highest amount given to a former Soviet republic, because of its cooperation and its efforts at reform. Several hundred Moldovans were sent to the US every year on exchange programs; Perina was also particularly proud of the Peace Corps contingent he saw there. Moldava was a main source of the trafficking of women from the former Soviet Union: Many young women were lured into the trade with promises of jobs as nannies and waitresses in Western Europe, the Balkans and the Middle East. The embassy tried to combat this with educational programs and financing a documentary film with victim testimonies that were shown in schools, on billboards and on national TV. He was in Moldova during the Transnistrian conflict, and though the US was not one of the three official mediators (those being Russia, the Ukraine, and the OSCE), the heads of the OSCE mission were American because the Moldovan government wanted to counterbalance their former rulers. Regardless, Perina met with Moldovan Presidents Petru Lucinschi then Vladimir Voronin on policy toward Transnistria, even initiating dialogue with the breakaway eastern region's so-called president, Igor Smirnov. Perina describes these half dozen talks with Smirnov as disheartening. This is because the disputed region had become a staging area for smuggling operations that avoided taxes and customs duties. Ukrainians and Moldavans alike profited off the illegal importation of cigarettes, liquor, and \\"many other commodities\\" that hurt the republic in lost tax revenue. Another problem was the 40,000 tons of aging Soviet ammunition stored at Cosbasna base in Transnistria: The US was a major contributor of several million dollars to a voluntary OSCE fund to aid in arms withdrawal and though there was a limited destruction of tanks and a half trainload of weapons and ammunition, Russian troops and old but still dangerous armaments were kept in the region for political leverage. The economic conflict of the region was also rooted in a lot of Moldava's industry being located in Transnistria, planned by Stalin.  Nagorno-Karabakh and three other former Soviet territories with conflicts Perina became the U.S. Special Negotiator for Nagorno-Karabakh and Eurasian Conflicts from 2001, flying out on September 23 when the US airports were reopened after 9/11. The ambassador-level job was Washington D.C.-based but involved a great deal of travel: He was the lead U.S. representative to international efforts to resolve four conflicts in territories of the former Soviet Union: Transnistria, Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia (Chechnya was the fifth former territory that also had strife but Russia did not let outside influence on it). The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict had roots in the 1990s war between Armenia and Azerbaijan: Perina called it a \\"true indigenous conflict\\" between the two countries. The OSCE and its specially created Minsk Group handled the crisis, with many proposals by the latter rejected by both nations, represented by Presidents Kocharyan and Aliyev respectively, over the years. The first meeting of what came to be known as the Prague Process took place outside the capital at Stirin Palace in mid-May 2002, a location that Perina helped arranged for. During the US diplomat's tenure through 2004, it remained a stalemated conflict lacking peacekeeping troops to maintain the separation between the sides with a few soldiers on both sides killed monthly by sniper fire. Perina 's 2002 idea of a referendum became the major consideration by 2004: The idea being that residents of Nagorno-Karabakh before hostilities would be able to vote, using lists from the Soviet era. With the intransigence of the two sides, in the end, the conflict was frozen; Perina said of it \\"the most you can hope for is stabilizing this conflict rather than really resolving it.\\" The Abkhaz were an ethnic minority who participating in the ethnic cleansing of several hundred thousand Georgians in the 1990s with the help of Russians and Chechens. There were 200,000 refugees that resulted. In Perina's view, \\"The hatred between [the two groups] was the worst I had ever seen in either the Balkans of the Caucauses\\" calling it \\"even greater than that between the Serbs and the Albanians.\\" The negotiating process over Abkhazia stalled but its very existence reduced pressure on the Georgian side for military action against it. The hostility in South Ossetia was a result of the succession by an ethnic group in Georgia that didn't want to be a part of an independent Georgia, didn't accept its sovereignty, and was protected in this by Russia. The disaccord, per Perina, nevertheless the most promising of the conflicts as the \\"hatred was not as deep.\\" He felt that most of the population would have welcomed a settlement. The EU was interested in aiding but the Russians blocked them. Perina kept working on the Transnistria in ex-officio capacity as the US was not one of the designated mediators. A mandate to resolve this conflict would have institutionalized Russia's presence in Moldava. Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian federation Dmitry Kozak attempted to head off the involvement of other countries by arranging for their own settlement for Vladmir Voronin to sign, giving Transnistria de facto veto power over big Moldavan policy decisions. When the Moldavans got wind of the memorandum, 50,000 demonstrated in its capital. There was also Georgia's Rose Revolution, which ousted President Shevardnadze out, and Veronin was successfully talked out of signing. Policy planning for the State Department From 2004 to 2006, Perina served as deputy director of the State Department's Policy Planning staff. He worked under both Colin Powell then Condi Rice, and the latter focussed only on Iraq and the Middle East. Perina found it bizarre that within the State Department, there was little debate on the decision to invade the former. (There were also no experts on the Muslim world in the department.) \\"The tipping point came imperceptibly, and suddenly everyone just assumed we would invade. The Afghanistan invasion ... appeared to have been successful.\\" He witnessed the policy tensions between Donald Rumsfeld of the Defense Department and Powell on the issue of responsibility for the administration of Iraq. As no one was prepared to do it, and the Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization was created in the State Department which would have a coordinator and a small staff of about a dozen who would come up with action plans and lists of experts including those outside of government to deal with humanitarian assistance, training police, instituting civil authority, and the like. Under Powell, Perina went to sub- Saharan Africa with an expert to start policy consultation with the African Union. He witnessed the rapid radicalization of Muslim communities on the continent by means of the madrassas staffed by Middle Eastern teachers. The Bush administration faulted the foreign service for this, refusing to see it connected to the invasion of Iraq. Powell, whom Perina called \\"probably the best Secretary I have worked for\\" was also the first major leader to name what was happening in Darfur as genocide, calling for a peacekeeping force but no country was up to it. Perina credits humanitarian organizations for relief supplies and food. Perina officially retired on April 30, 2006, after 32 years in the foreign service.

Non- diplomatic appointments In 2007, Perina completed an oral history of his life and career for Frontline Diplomacy: the Foreign Affairs Oral History Collection of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. It is available online through the Library of Congress. He was the Scarff Visiting Professor of International Relations at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin in fall 2010 and was on the Council of Advisors of the Wende Museum, a research institute and archive of the Cold War located in Culver City, California. Personal life He met his wife, Ethel Ott Hetherington, at the 1968 Columbia student protests, and they married in Salzburg, Austria on May 26, 1972. Ethel taught at the International School of Belgrade while he was Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy there in the 1990s. He was fluent in four languages: English, Czech, Russian, and French and knew Romanian. They have two daughters, Kaja and Alexandra, and four grandchildren and lived in the Washington D.C. area until his death on June 14, 2018.

A theologian and university professor, he is also regarded as one of the most original voices of modern Portuguese literature and a Catholic intellectual. His work includes poetry, essays and plays. An archbishop since July 2018, he has been Archivist and Librarian of the Holy Roman Church since 1 September 2018. Pope Francis created him cardinal on 5 October 2019. Biography  Family  The youngest of five children, de Mendon√ßa was born on the island of Madeira, Portugal on 15 December 1965. He spent his earliest years in Angola, in several coastal towns where his father was a fisherman. He left Africa at the age of nine when Portugal withdrew from its African colonies.  Priest and Academic  In 1989, he graduated with the equivalent of a bachelor's degree in theology from the Portuguese Catholic University (UCP). He was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Funchal, Madeira, on 28 July 1990. That same year he published his first book of poems, Os Dias Contados. In 1992, he was awarded a master's degree in biblical sciences at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome. In 2004, he earned a doctorate in biblical theology at the Portuguese Catholic University (UCP). He has fulfilled pastoral assignments, first of all at the parish of Nossa Senhora do Livramento in Funchal from 1992 to 1995, then as chaplain at the UCP for 5 years. He next served the parish of Santa Isabel in Lisbon and then became rector of the chapel of Nossa Senhora da Bonanza, better known as Capela do Rato, in 2010. De Mendon√ßa's assignments following his ordination included academic appointments as a lecturer at the diocesan seminary of Funchal, the rector of the Pontifical Portuguese College in Rome, and a lecturer at the Portuguese Catholic University. He was visiting professor the Catholic University of Pernambuco (Unicap), Brazil, the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro and the Jesuit School of Philosophy and Theology of Belo Horizonte (Faje). In Lisbon, he joined the UCP faculty as an assistant (1996-1999), assistant professor (2005-2015), and associate professor. The UCP appointed him Vice-Rector in 2012 and Dean of the Faculty of Theology in 2018. During the academic year 2011-12, he was a Straus Fellow at New York University, joining an international team of researchers working on the theme \\"Religion and Public Reason\\".  At the service of culture  De Mendon√ßa was the first director of the National Secretariat of the Pastoral of Culture from 2004 to 2014, an institution created by the Portuguese Episcopal Conference to promote dialogue between the Church and the broader cultural milieu of the country. After attending a meeting with Pope Benedict XVI bringing together a large number of artists in 2009, he said that the Pope's gesture of hospitality was appreciated. Benedict pointed out that \\"within the Church, within the Christian space, they have their home, a sort of homeland\\". In 2011 Benedict XVI appointed him a consultor of the Pontifical Council for Culture. Pope Francis reappointed him to this position in 2016. In 2018 Pope Francis invited de Mendon√ßa to preach the Lenten Retreat of the Roman Curia. Besides the Bible, his comments referenced many writers, such as Fernando Pessoa, Roland Barthes, Clarice Lispector, Fran√ßoise Dolto, Etty Hillesum and Blaise Pascal. He commented: \\"Sometimes writers are important spiritual masters.\\" He also mentioned that he tells his biblical students that \\"a biblical scholar or a priest must see many movies, listen to a lot of music and get in touch with the arts world\\". These sermons were published under the title Elogio da Sede with a preface by Pope Francis. In January 2020, de Mendon√ßa was part of the scientific commission for the 700th anniversary of Dante Alighieri's death (1265-1321) organized by the Pontifical Council for Culture. In February 2020, Pope Francis appointed de Mendon√ßa as a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture, chaired by Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi. De Mendon√ßa had been a consultor between 2011 and 2018. On June 13th, 2020, de Mendon√ßa is laureate of Pr√©mio Europeu Helena Vaz da Silva because of \\"the ability he shows in spreading beauty and poetry as part of the intangible cultural heritage of Europe and the world\\". De Mendon√ßa has published numerous collections of essays, spiritual writings, poems and sermons under the name Jos√© Tolentino Mendon√ßa. This work addresses the major themes of the Christian canon by placing them in dialogue with life. The relationship between Christianity and culture is at the heart of his writings. As a theologian and religious thinker, he has sought to discover spiritual life in places which have not always been looked at, and he has striven to encourage the Church to be more relevant and more engaged there. His books have been great successes in Portugal and are increasingly translated and published abroad. He has received numerous literary prizes and awards.  Bishop and cardinal  At the end of June 2018, Pope Francis named de Mendon√ßa Vatican archivist and Librarian of the Holy Roman Church as of September 1 and appointed him titular archbishop of Suava. On July 28, Archbishop Manuel Clemente, Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon, consecrated him a bishop assisted by Cardinal Ant√≥nio Marto, Bishop of Leiria-F√°tima, and Teodoro de Faria, Bishop Emeritus of Funchal who had ordained him a priest in July 1990. De Mendon√ßa, Bel√©m, 28.07.2018 On 5 October 2019, Pope Francis made him a Cardinal Deacon and assigned him the church of Santi Domenico e Sisto in Rome. He was made a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture on 21 February 2020. De Mendon√ßa, July 2018 De Mendon√ßa at Capela do Rato, on 22.

After the Washington Naval Treaty prohibited the development of guns larger than , the gun was relined and finished as a high velocity 16\\"/56 Mark 4 gun. After the start of World War II, the gun was again relined to 18\\" and tested with a new Super Heavy Shell. The gun in its final form is currently displayed at the Dahlgren Naval Weapons Facility in Virginia, USA. Description After World War I, the erstwhile allies were poised to start a massive and costly naval arms race, with the United Kingdom, United States, and Japan creating plans for large fleets of new battleships and battlecruisers. The 18\\"/48 cal Mark 1, designed in 1920, was the result of the progression to larger and more heavily armed capital ships. It was designed to fire a AP shell at a muzzle velocity of . The gun prototype was halfway completed when the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 prohibited the development of guns larger than 16-inches. Consequently, the prototype was converted to a long barrel 16-inch gun and thus never fired in its original design configuration. Despite the treaty, battleship studies conducted in 1927-1928 had considered this gun, but was rejected due to excessive weight, very short liner life, and poor deck penetrating capability. The gun's size and weight meant that fewer 18-inch guns could be carried than 16-inch gun on a ship of a given size, while the large size and weight of the shells also reduced rate of fire. 16\\"/56 caliber Mark 4 The 18\\"/48 cal Mark 1 was finished with an extra thick 16-inch liner, and the resulting weapon became the 16\\"/56 cal Mark 4. The gun was first tested at the Dahlgren proving grounds in 1927, with tests continuing into the 1930s. It fired a AP shell at muzzle velocity, with a range of at 40¬∞ elevation. The high muzzle velocity of the prototype resulted in very short liner life of only 45 rounds, with a predicted liner life of 125 full charge rounds for the service weapon. During the early stages of the design process for the , the gun was briefly considered for the main battery, but was rejected due to short liner life; the belt armor of the Montana class was also designed against the 16\\"/56 cal gun.Garzke & Dulin pp. 154-157Friedman pp. 330-332 18\\"/47 caliber Mark A In 1938, with Japan's refusal to sign the Second London Naval Treaty and worsening situation in Europe and Asia, battleship studies once again considered 18-inch caliber main guns. During the early design stages of a 45,000-ton \\"slow\\" battleship alternative to the \\"fast\\" battleship design that would eventually result in the , the 18\\"/48 cal gun option was considered in several proposals.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 110-112Friedman pp. 308 The 16\\"/56 cal Mark 4 had its threaded tip cut off and was then relined to 18-inches; this weapon was then designated as the 18\\"/47 cal Mark A and was used to test a \\"Super Heavy\\" AP shell, which the gun fired at a nominal muzzle velocity, with a range of at 40¬∞ elevation. The highest energy shot was with a 3,848-lb projectile fired at with a maximum pressure of 19.91 tons per square inch. Ultimately, the General Board decided that a 16\\"/50 cal gun offered the best combination of performance and weight, and the new 16\\"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun was used by the design. The preeminence of naval aviation ended further developments into large caliber naval guns. While the 18\\"/47 cal Mark A was used to test the new \\"Super Heavy\\" 18-inch AP shell, if the caliber had been selected, a new lightweight 18\\"/48 cal Mark 2 gun would have been built. The new lightweight 18-inch gun would have fired the 3,850 lb \\"Super Heavy\\" shell at muzzle velocity, with a design reflecting those used in the contemporary 16\\"/50 cal Mark 7 gun rather than the 1920s technology used in the 18\\"/47 cal Mark A construction.Sumrall pp.66 While the development of large caliber naval guns ceased after World War 2, the gun was subsequently used for the development of low-drag aerial bombs. In this role, the gun fired a total of 114 shots, with the final shot occurring on 7 November 1957. With the conclusion of testing, the gun was placed on display at the Dahlgren Naval Weapons Facility in Virginia, USA.History of the U.S. Navy‚Äôs Only 18-inch Gun.

He was seen in April 2019 touring the facility on a golf cart.Monique O. Madan and Ben Wieder Although Caliburn, Comprehensive and DC Capital appear to have accrued financial benefits via government contracts during and subsequent to Kelly's serving as White House chief of staff, Columbia Law School professor Richard Briffault said Kelly didn't necessarily break any ethics and conflict of interest rules: \\"It sounds like he's running between the raindrops. It doesn't sound great, but most likely he's not directly violating any policies.\\" Briffault said government officials are prohibited from benefiting from their involvement in matters involving specific parties. That meant while he served in the White House, Kelly couldn't directly influence any contract-awarding decision to a DC Capital subsidiary. \\"This is classic revolving door,\\" he continued. That employment meant Kelly couldn't lobby or attempt to influence government policy for five years, although he could return to his former company.

Operations  The Homestead Temporary Shelter was originally opened during the Obama administration, holding 8,500 juveniles while it operated between June 2016 and April 2017. It was the first in South Florida to be able to house minor immigrants to the United States. In 2017, the shelter was shut down when there was no longer a need to house unaccompanied minors, but in early 2018, the shelter was reopened \\"without public notice.\\" In February 2018, CHSi won a $30 million government contract to run the shelter. The cost was a million dollars per day.How We Shut Down the Nation's Largest Child Detention Center, Yes! Magazine, Kristin Kumpf, September 9, 2019. It was believed that the contract had been crafted in an effort to circumvent the Flores Settlement Agreement (FSA) which had been arrived at in 1997 after over 11 years of litigation regarding the care of minor immigrants in detention. The detention facility is surrounded by tall fencing with security checkpoints in a former Job Corps building on the Homestead Air Reserve Base. Minors in the shelter were provided with meals, snacks, medical care, recreation time and classes. The facility was operated by Comprehensive Health Services, Inc. (CHSi), used to house minors between the ages of 13 and 17. Starting in mid-April 2018, CHSi began to advertise to recruit employees to fill about 40 new positions in Homestead. In 2019, the center became a focal point in the controversy regarding the separating of minor children of asylum seekers at the U.S. Border. On July first and second, a delegation of congressional Democrats visited the facility and raised objections to the conditions in which these minors were kept. The late Maryland Representative Elijah Cummings, who chaired the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, said, \\"The Trump Administration's actions at the southern border are grotesque and dehumanizing,\\" \\"There seems to be open contempt for the rule of law and for basic human decency. The Committee needs to hear directly from the heads of these agencies as soon as possible in light of the almost daily reports of abuse and defiance.\\" He invited both acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan from the Department of Homeland Security and Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection at a July 12, 2019 hearing and indicated he would be prepared to subpoena top officials of President Donald Trump's administration if they refused his request to testify before the committee. \\"I encourage Acting Secretary McAleenan and Acting Commissioner Morgan to appear voluntarily in order to answer these critical questions,\\" Cummings indicated that he would subpoena senior Trump officials if they declined his invitation to testify.Lawmakers demand change after scrutinizing conditions at immigrant detention centers, ABC News, John Parkinson, July 2, 2019.

Mississippi Representative Bennie Thompson, who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, joined a delegation of Democrats at the detention compound, including Democratic 2020 presidential candidates who visited it while they were in Miami for the Democratic presidential debates that were held on June 26 and 27, 2019. On July 15, 2019, the center was visited by a congressional delegation which found the government had just rapidly reduced the number of teenagers detained there, a 42% drop in 12 days. Those legislators already intended to analyze how the facility operated and to ask for an accounting for its expenditures. A month earlier, it held 2,460 migrant children, from 13 to 17 years old, an 80% rise since it initially opened in the first quarter of 2018. On July 3, it had held 2,252 children, but by that morning, only 1,309 remained. The chairwoman of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, Connecticut's Rosa DeLauro, wanted to know if those who had so quickly left had been paired with family members or sponsors, or just transferred to alternate shelters. Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who had previously been refused entry asked, \\"What the heck. From July 3 until July 14th, suddenly they‚Äôre able to drop 1,000 kids here when they couldn‚Äôt do that as quickly before? Where did they go?\\" Caliburn International did not inform them regarding possible closure but did tell them that on July 3, the shelter went on ‚Äúadmittance stop, so no new children have come in since then,\\" and that DHHS began, \\"...releasing kids as quickly as possible.\\" In the previous week, \\"448 children were released from the shelter, mostly identified as \\"reunifications to a sponsor,\\" in addition to transfers to alternate facilities. There were 376 who had been reunified with family and another 70 had been transferred. Two others left because they were over 18 years old. A policy change meant that prior caregivers were no longer required to be fingerprinted. Deputy Assistant Secretary for public affairs at the DHHS, Mark Weber, described Homestead as \\"an emergency influx shelter for use when the standard shelter system is near capacity,\\" and space had become available at standard shelters. Miami Congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who had inquired about hurricane planning, said that the lack of such an emergency policy was an \\"extremely dangerous form of neglect.\\" A Caliburn representative said the facility wasn't accepting new placements and was ‚Äúnot sure for how long‚Äù the no-admissions policy would remain.Where are the 943 migrant children who were moved so quickly from Homestead shelter?, South Florida Sun Sentinel, Anthony Man, July 16, 2019.

While most of the minors in the Homestead shelter crossed the border unaccompanied, in June 2018, 94 of the roughly 1,000 children in the center at that time had been separated from their parents at the border under the Trump administration family separation policy. Protesters, which included members of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) gathered 128,000 signatures from opponents of the facility. On June 22, 2018, government officials were allowed to tour the facilities which had 782 boys and 387 girls on the premises. On average, minors remain in the shelter for around 25 days before they are placed in homes of family or friends who live in the U.S. This is despite current immigration laws that limit detention to only 20 days. Despite being contractually obligated to close on April 20, 2019, the facility remained open holding children until August, 2019. The facility had been opened and closed during the Obama administration and reopened in 2018, and was emptied by August 3, 2019.

The previous day, Democratic politicians including, state Representative Kionne McGhee, then-Senator Bill Nelson and Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, were denied entry to the shelter. This led to protesters accusing the Trump administration of trying to cover up mistreatment. Senator Marco Rubio was allowed to visit Homestead on June 22, though he did not describe what he saw. In April, 2019, Wasserman Schultz, plus newly-elected Congresswomen Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, and Donna Shalala, all representing parts of Miami-Dade County, were refused entry into the facility by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), despite their having the legal authority to demand entry. Shalala headed DHHS for eight years during the Clinton administration. Congressman Charlie Christ, Florida's former governor, termed the situation, \\"...indefensible.

They're kids, and they don't need to have big box stores serving them.\\" \\"You can't just order up migrant care.\\" In February 2019, reporters on a tour of the facility were informed that older children preferred the huge dormitory holding hundreds of beds, a program manager telling them, \\"They say it's like a slumber party.\\" In Topeka, Kansas, Washburn University law professor David Rubenstein, whose research is focused on privatized immigrant detention said, \\"The profiteering incentive comes at the cost of cutting programs or rights or treatment or conditions.\\" Two former employees have filed lawsuits claiming they weren't properly trained or paid properly for their work at the shelter. They say that they were hired as travel chaperones but were asked to perform other duties. They claim that their work hours were reduced and then they were fired after complaining about their situation. At a September 18, 2019 hearing of the U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, et al, in response to a question posed by Representative Mark Pocan, Jonathan Hayes, the acting director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement said the Department of Health and Human Services had spent more than $33 million in 46 days to keep the vacant Homestead center in operation although no children were currently housed there. The empty shelter cost taxpayers $720,000 a day: $600 a day for each of 1,200 empty beds at the military base facility.

Facility shortcomings  A Stanford University expert in child trauma, Ryan Matlow, expressed concerns that size of the Homestead facility was inappropriate, that it was much too large to address the individual needs of children and that the depersonalization of detainees could produce long term physical and emotional effects, including heart problems and depression. The corporation's plans for additional facilities holding up to 500 children would still be expected to produce such effects. The shelter property abuts a military Superfund site. It is surrounded by soil and groundwater contaminated with dangerous metal and chemicals which include arsenic and lead, and adjacent land was utilized for hazardous waste, munitions, and pesticide storage. Contaminants at such sites can cause a variety of health problems, including being carcinogenic, causing renal failure and developmental damage. Because of chemical contamination, residential development on land surrounding the shelter site is forbidden. An inquiry by the Miami Herald did not disclose any evidence that the shelter site was tested for such contaminants or if it had been evaluated as to their impact on children held there. There was an additional problem regarding exposure to high levels of noise at the center as it is proximate to operations of the Homestead Air Reserve Base's F-16C fighter jets. The center was found to be in a noise zone that according to the United States Air Force (USAF), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), is \\"normally unacceptable\\" for any human residence. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), such a level of sustained noise exposure can be damaging to the cognition and development of children.Potential contamination at Homestead detention center means it can‚Äôt be safe to house children, Miami Herald, Jonathan Fried and Lisa Evans, October 03, 2019.

Contractor favoritism  In December 2016, Comprehensive Health Services (CHSi) announced a new project that would \\"create 150 new jobs\\" at its Cape Canaveral headquarters. Consequently, in July 2017, the state awarded it a $600,000 \\"qualified target-industry\\" tax-incentive package. As then-Governor, now-U.S. Senator Rick Scott negotiated that tax break, Comprehensive Health concluded a deal to pay a $3.8 million settlement to the U.S. Department of Justice to settle a medical-fraud claim. The corporation paid the fine in February 2017, without admitting guilt, but the state of Florida still issued the tax breaks. Despite an absence of competitive bidding, in late April 2019, CHSi was granted a new contract worth at least $341 million, but which could increase substantially if the population of children continued to rise.Critics deplore this migrant shelter.

A joint investigation by the Associated Press and the PBS investigative journalism flagship feature, Frontline, found that although the shelter had been completely empty for two months, it still had 2,000 staff on hand. There had been concerted initiatives on the part of the Trump administration to shift detained children from non-profit, often religious denomination-operated shelters, to Caliburn and other for-profit prison operators, such as the GEO Group. Trump's Health and Human Services Secretary, a long time Republican executive and judicial branch insider, Alex Azar, called the findings of the investigators \\"misleading,\\" but avoided addressing the shifting to for-profit privatization providers, which were exclusive to Caliburn at the time. Six other Comprehensive Health Services programs in Texas that were holding migrant children were booming, including those in San Benito, Brownsville, and Los Fresnos.

It was one of the first modern howitzers equipped with a recoil system. History Development of the mle 1890 began in 1886 at the Atelier-de-pr√©cision in Paris, following a request by the French Army for a mobile heavy howitzer capable of high angle fire. Design The mle 1890 is a transitional piece and was a combination of both old and new ideas. It was a breech loaded howitzer with a steel barrel and a de Bange obturator designed by Colonel Charles Ragon de Bang which used separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. The barrel was the same as used on the earlier Obusier de 155 mm C modele 1881 siege gun. The steel box trail carriage had two wooden spoked wheels with steel rims and was designed to be light enough to be horse-drawn in one piece. The carriage was split into two parts, a stationary lower part which supported the weapon and a sliding upper part which supported the gun barrel. The barrel was inserted into a cradle with a hydro-pneumatic recoil system below the barrel which connected to the lower portion of the carriage. The cradle and carriage had a hollow center section to allow for high angles of elevation, while the front of the cradle pivoted to allow limited traverse. When the gun fired the cradle recoiled backward, while the lower part stayed anchored. This style of carriage and recoil system was also used by the less powerful Obusier de 120 mm C mod√®le 1890. The recoil mechanism was not enough to absorb the barrels recoil forces and this made the piece unstable at firing. This style of carriage and recoil system did not find wider acceptance due to its insufficient performance. First world war Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Fortresses, armories, coastal fortifications, and museums were scoured for heavy artillery and sent to the front. Suitable field and rail carriages were built for these guns in an effort to give their forces the heavy field artillery needed to overcome trenches and hardened concrete fortifications. In August 1914, 134 mle 1890s were assigned to r√©giments d'artillerie lourde de campagne (heavy field artillery regiments) and r√©giments d'artillerie √† pied (fortress artillery regiments) in forts of the S√©r√© de Rivi√®res.

The ministry oversees the operations of the following agencies: * Compulsory Enforcement Service * Penitentiary Service * Probation Service The ministry was founded in 1918 by the government of Hovhannes Kajaznuni of the newly- formed Republic of Armenia.  History  In 1920, the Revolutionary Committee of the Armenian SSR founded the People's Commissariat of Justice, which began to control the Armenian prosecutor's office in December 1923. The Communist Party of Armenia was in-active from 1930 to 1933, of which during those three years, the justice system of Armenia was administered by the Procurator General of the Soviet Union and the Supreme Court of the USSR. In 1936, the prosecutor's office and the investigative bodies were separated from the People's Court of Justice, and the People's Commissariat was reorganized into the Ministry of Justice. It operated until 1959, when its functions were exercised by the Supreme Court until the 1970s. By order of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of November 2, 1970, the Ministry of Justice of the Armenian SSR was reestablished and became the precursor to the Ministry of Justice of Armenia which was founded in 1991, following the USSR's demise.

Legend of Texas was a Division III DCI Corps from Lubbock, Texas active from 1998 to 2001. History Legend was founded by Scott Puryear in 1998. The corps was established as a way for potential members in Western Texas to march a drum corps without having to travel large distances to march. The corps was established by a board of directors who had previously marched in drum corps. They had nearly a combined total of 35 years drum corps experience. One of the goals of the board was to provide a positive experience in the same manner the founding members had with their drum corps experiences. The uniforms, music, and show concepts would reflect the influences of Texas with the corps. In 1999, Legend was made a part of the DCI Pacific Division. They were the 16th corps to be a part of the circuit and the first one located east of the Rockies. The corps entered DCI as a Division III corps. The corps fielded a hornline of 10, a grounded percussion of 4, a color guard of 5, and 1 Drum Major. The show chosen was based on local rock legend Buddy Holly. The music consisted of the music of Buddy Holly and Don McLean's epic song \\"American Pie\\". After a limited tour schedule, they performed at the DCI Division III Prelims, placing a solid 15th place out of 31 corps. In 2000, the corps picked a completing Western theme for the show. Through the use of various pieces of music, the corps presented the day in the life of a cowboy. The show even utilized a saloon in the middle of the field. The corps marched a larger corps with a hornline of 12, a color guard of 3, a drumline of 12 (4P/3S/1Q/4B), and 1 Drum Major. The show was considerably more difficult and ambitious than the previous year. After a significantly longer tour than the previous year, Legend placed 15th at Division III Prelims with a 73.150. Unfortunately, the corps was unable to financially field a corps the next year. The corps ended up folding as a result. At the time the corps went inactive, plans were in place for a Legend of Texas winterguard and winter drumline to compete at Winter Guard International in 2001, as well as a brass ensemble to perform at local events and venues through the winter season Show summary Gold background indicates DCI Championship; pale blue background indicates DCI Class Finalist; pale green background indicates DCI semifinalist. {  center; width:100%;\\" - !

Town of Cline Falls  In the early years of the twentieth century, the community of Cline Falls was established on property owned by Cline. The town was located on the west bank of the Deschutes River overlooking a large waterfall. The waterfall and the town were both named after Cline. In 1904, the Cline Falls post office was opened. At its height, the town had two stores, two hotels, a livery stable, a school, a meat market, and a newspaper. The town site also had several homes (including one belonging to Cline) as well as 500 residential lots available for sale. In addition, the town had a power plant that generated electricity by diverting water above the falls to flow through turbines at the bottom of the falls.Hole, Leslie Pugmire and Trish Pinkerton, \\"Building a Community\\", Images of America: Redmond, Arcadia Publishing, Chicago, Illinois, 2009, p. 28.\\" Cline Falls\\", 1901 Annual Number, Crook County Journal; Prineville, Oregon, January 2, 1901, p. 13. \\"Cline Falls\\", An Illustrated History of Central Oregon: Embracing Wasco, Sherman, Gilliam, Wheeler, Crook, Lake, and Klamath Counties, Western Historical Publishing Company, Spokane, Washington, 1905, p. 732.Brogan, Phil F., East of the Cascades, Binfords and Mort, Portland, Oregon, 1965, p. 147-148.

She held positions at Columbia University, the National Library of Medicine and the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). Brodman served terms as director of the Special Libraries Association, president of the Medical Library Association, and editor of the Bulletin of the Medical Library Association. Under Brodman's leadership, the library at WUSM became known as a leader in the use of computing machines to perform library functions. Early life Brodman was born in New York City on June 1, 1914. Her father, Henry Brodman, was a physician. Her mother was Nettie Sameth Brodman. She had one brother, Keeve, who became a psychiatrist. She described them as growing up in a \\"culture of Talmudic scholars\\" and said that there was an emphasis on intellectual pursuits in her family that influenced her for the rest of her career. Brodman said that she could not relate to those who did not enjoy learning new things. Earning an undergraduate degree in histology and embryology from Cornell University, Brodman was hoping to go to medical school, but she was not accepted. She recalled with embarrassment that she had entered a library career almost inadvertently while having a quarrel with her mother. When her mother suggested becoming a social worker instead of a physician, Brodman snapped back sarcastically that she would rather become a librarian than a social worker. \\"Since she was paying for it, that's what I became,\\" Brodman explained. After earning a bachelor's degree in library science from Columbia University in 1936, Brodman began her career at the Columbia medical library while pursuing a master's degree in library science. When Brodman was told that she could never become the head librarian at Columbia because she was a woman, she decided to begin work on a Ph.D. in the history of medicine at Columbia. Career Brodman taught courses in library science at Columbia and a nursing history course for nursing students at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital. When one of Brodman's library science students, Frank Bradway Rogers, became the head of the Army Medical Library (later known as the National Library of Medicine), he asked Brodman to take a position there as an assistant reference librarian. Near the end of her time at the NLM, she worked to formulate the Medical Library Assistance Act, though it did not become legislation until several years after Brodman left the NLM. At WUSM, Brodman became increasingly involved in using computers to increase automation of library functions. While computers were beginning to play a role in other university matters, there were not enough information technology staff members to meet the library's goals, so Brodman had the library staff trained in some IT functions. As the university's library utilized more technology, it began to host annual conferences on the use of computers for librarians. After twelve years at the NLM, Brodman left to become Associate Professor of Medical History at the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) in 1961. She had completed her Ph.D. in 1954. Brodman was promoted to full professor by 1964. Based on her doctoral dissertation, Brodman wrote a book, The Development of Medical Bibliography, which became a standard reference in medical librarianship. She also authored several biographical papers on historical figures in medicine and she advocated for the development and expansion of the MLA's oral history project. Brodman traveled abroad as a consultant and lecturer; she taught librarianship at Japan's Keio University and took a trip sponsored by the World Health Organization to evaluate family planning practices in India. She retired from WUSM in 1981. Service Brodman served on several commissions and boards. From 1949 to 1952, Brodman was director of the Special Libraries Association (SLA); before that, she had chaired the association's Biological Sciences Group. In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson established the National Advisory Commission on Libraries (NACL) to assess the role of libraries in the United States; he appointed Brodman to the group. The NACL recommended the establishment of the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. She served on the executive council of the American Association for the History of Medicine and chaired the Biomedical Communication Study Section of the National Institutes of Health. She also served extensively with the Medical Library Association (MLA); she was the editor of the Bulletin of the Medical Library Association, the predecessor to the Journal of the Medical Library Association, from 1947 to 1957. She was president of the MLA in 1964-65. Honors and awards In 1971, the MLA honored Brodman with the Marcia C. Noyes Award, which \\"recognizes a career that has resulted in lasting, outstanding contributions to medical librarianship\\". Brodman received the MLA's Gottlieb Award (now known as the Erich Meyerhoff Prize) in 1977 in recognition of the best unpublished paper related to the history of medicine. She was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Illinois. In 1981, she received the SLA's John Cotton Dana Award. Later life By 1985, Brodman lived in a retirement village in Hightstown, New Jersey. In 1986, the MLA created the Estelle Brodman Award to honor outstanding mid-career academic medical librarians. Brodman died of natural causes in New Jersey in 2007.

It is restricted to the Kaveri river basin. It can be distinguished from other mahseer from the prominent hump on its back, and its bright orange caudal fin. It is considered a high-quality game fish, and has been proclaimed by anglers as \\"the largest and hardest fighting freshwater fish in the world\\". The reason for the species' endangerment is the introduction of a non-native \\"blue-finned mahseer\\" (generally considered to be Tor khudree, though the \\"blue-finned mahseer\\"'s classification is under scrutiny as it actually may be a different, undescribed species) to the Kaveri river basin. Also endangering this species is the heavy construction of dams along the Cauvery, as well as the use of dynamite fishing. These have led to a heavy crash in mahseer populations since 2004. Despite this endangered status, general lack of a formal scientific name has hampered efforts to protect species. However, a 2018 study found out that the orange-finned mahseer was in fact conspecific with Tor remadevii, a little-known species identified in 2007 based on a single juvenile individual from the Pambar River.

Australian Historical Studies 37.128 (2006) pp: 1‚Äì17 online Australia developed its own system, through its own engineers, manufacturers, retailers, newspapers, entertainment services, and news agencies. The government set up the first radio system, and business interests marginalized the hobbyists and amateurs. The Labor Party was especially interested in radio because it allowed them to bypass the newspapers, which were mostly controlled by the opposition. Both parties agreed on the need for a national system, and in 1932 set up the Australian Broadcasting Commission, as a government agency that was largely separate from political interference. The first commercial broadcasters, originally known as \\"B\\" class stations were on the air as early as 1925. Many were sponsored by newspapers in Australia,Denis Cryle, \\"The press and public service broadcasting: Neville Petersen's news not views and the case for Australian exceptionalism.\\" (2014) Media International Australia, Incorporating Culture & Policy Issue 151 (May 2014): 56+. by theatrical interests, by amateur radio enthusiasts and radio retailers, and by retailers generally.R.R. Walker, The Magic Spark ‚Äì 50 Years of Radio in Australia (1973). Almost all Australians were within reach of a station by the 1930s, and the number of stations remained relatively stable through the post-war era. However, in the 1970s, the Labor government under Prime Minister Gough Whitlam commenced a broadcasting renaissance so that by the 1990s there were 50 different radio services available for groups based on tastes, languages, religion, or geography.John Potts, Radio in Australia (1986) The broadcasting system was largely deregulated in 1992, except that there were limits on foreign ownership and on monopolistic control. By 2000, 99 percent of Australians owned at least one television set, and averaged 20 hours a week watching it.Graeme Davison et al., eds., The Oxford Companion to Australian History (2001), pp 546‚Äì47, 637‚Äì38 Programming Most Australian stations originally broadcast music interspersed with such things as talks, coverage of sporting events, church broadcasts, weather, news and time signals of various types. Virtually all stations also had programs of interest to women, and children's sessions. From the outset, A Class stations' peak-hour evening programs often consisted of live broadcasts from various theatres, including concerts dramas, operas, musicals, variety shows, and vaudeville. The first dramas especially written for radio were heard in the mid-1920s. The standard accent used by actors and announcers was \\"Southern English\\", an upper-class British version that emulated the BBC. The actual Australian accent was acceptable only in low comedy, as in the long-running \\"Dad and Dave from Snake Gully\\" program.John Rickard, Australia: A Cultural History (1988) p. 141 By the 1930s, the ABC was transmitting a number of British programs sourced from the BBC, and commercial stations were receiving a number of US programs, particularly dramas. However, in the 1940s, war-time restrictions made it difficult to access overseas programs and, therefore, the amount of Australian dramatic material increased. As well as using original ideas and scripts, there were a number of local versions of overseas programs. Initially, much of the music broadcast in Australia was from live studio concerts. However, the amount of gramophone (and piano roll) music soon increased dramatically, particularly on commercial stations. In the late 1930s, the number of big production variety shows multiplied significantly, particularly on the two major commercial networks, Macquarie and Major. After World War II the independent Colgate-Palmolive radio production unit was formed. It poached most major radio stars from the various stations. Family audiences Until the 1950s, the whole family seated around a set in the living room was the typical way of listening to radio. Stations tried to be all things to all people, and specialised programming was not really thought about at this stage (it did not come in until the late 1950s). Because of this, programming on most stations was pretty much the same. In the immediate post-war period, commercial stations typically had a schedule that looked something like this: a breakfast session with bright music including band music, news and weather, a children's segment and, usually, an exercise segment; morning programs were aimed at women listeners, often with large blocks of soap operas or serials, and many segments of the handy hints genre; afternoon programs were also usually geared at women but with more music and, often, a request session; after school, there was inevitably a Children's Session (often hosted by an aunt or uncle or both), and usually featuring birthday greetings; this was followed by another block of serials, often geared at children, and/or dinner music; the major news bulletin was usually at 7.00 pm, often followed by a news commentary; the peak listening hours typically consisted of a mix of variety programs (including many quizzes), dramas, talent quests and the occasional musical program, often live; late night programming mainly consisted of relaxing music, usually mellow jazz or light classical. There was usually only one station in each capital city that was licensed to broadcast through the night. Children In children's programming, Ambrose Saunders (1895‚Äì1953) was a leading actor. A baritone, He became \\"Uncle George\\", telling bedtime stories at first. In 1926 he was joined by his foil Arthur Hahn as 'Bimbo'. In 1927 they moved to 2GB, a pioneer commercial stations. Storytelling was the main ingredient, accompanied by birthday calls, call-out greetings to listeners, songs, and things to make and do. Story-telling remained Saunders' signature role until he retired from radio in 1940.Jan Brazier, 'Saunders, Ambrose George Thomas (1895‚Äì1953)', Australian Dictionary of Biography (1988) v.11; accessed 14 May 2015. Sports Cricket became the major Australian sport in the 1930s, and radio played its part, especially when its broadcast of the test matches with England swelled national pride.Frazer Andrewes, \\"'They Play in Your Home': Cricket, Media and Modernity in Pre-War Australia\\", International Journal of the History of Sport (2000) 17#2‚Äì3 pp: 93‚Äì110. Johnny Moyes, (1893‚Äì1963), a veteran newspaper journalist, by 1955 was a leading cricket broadcaster. His biographer notes that his \\"pithy and authoritative commentaries, delivered in a 'dryly-humourous voice', won thousands of listeners to the A.B.C. He was renowned for his summaries of the day's game which, he wrote, should be 'factual and yet not dull'\\". His 'infectiously hysterical' description of the last over of the tied Test between Australia and the West Indies in 1960 became an iconic statement of broadcast journalism at its most entertaining.Anne O'Brien, 'Moyes, Alban George (Johnny) (1893‚Äì1963)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, (2000) v 15; accessed online 14 May 2015 Cyril Angles, (1906‚Äì1962), a former jockey, began broadcasting horse races in 1931 over station 2KY. He called from 30 to 60 races every week, some 30,000 during his career, as well as commenting on many other sporting events. His biographer notes that, \\"The accuracy of his incisive and unhurried descriptions, delivered in a flat, mechanical and slightly abrasive voice, established his reputation.\\" He became the best-paid sportscaster in Australia.John Ritchie, 'Angles, Cyril Joseph (1906‚Äì1962)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, (1993) v 13; accessed online 14 May 2015 Religion Religious programs were widely broadcast, with an emphasis on religious services, sermons, and church music. One of the most popular programs from 1931 to 1968 was \\"Dr. Rumble's Question Box.\\" Rumble, a Catholic priest, gave advice by answering letters from listeners about life's problems for an hour every Sunday night. Frank Sturge Harty broadcast a similar program every afternoon from an Anglican perspective.Bridget Griffen-Foley, \\"Radio Ministries: Religion on Australian Commercial Radio from the 1920s to the 1960s\\", Journal of Religious History (2008) 32#1 pp: 31‚Äì54. online Trouble arose in 1931 when the Jehovah's Witnesses took control of station 5KA. In 1933 the government banned its diatribes against the Catholic Church, the British Empire, and the United States. In 1941 its station was closed down as dangerous to national security, at the demand of the Army and Navy. Furthermore, the Jehovah's Witnesses were declared an illegal organization.Peter Strawhan, \\"The closure of radio 5KA, January 1941\\". Australian Historical Studies 21.85 (1985) pp: 550‚Äì564. online  The 1950s and 1960s  Australian radio sets usually had the positions of radio stations marked on their dials. The illustration is a dial from a transistorised, mains operated Calstan radio, circa 1960s. (Click image for a high resolution view, with readable callsigns.) Norman Banks at the 3KZ microphone, in the late 1930s. Banks was one of Melbourne's (and Australia's) most prominent broadcasters at 3KZ (1930‚Äì1952) and 3AW (1952‚Äì1978). He is remembered for founding Carols by Candlelight, as a pioneer football commentator, and for hosting both musical and interview programs. In later years he was one of Melbourne's first and most prominent talkback hosts. At the commencement of his career, Banks was known for his double entendres and risque remarks; as a talk back host he was outspoken in his conservative views, especially regarding the White Australia policy and Apartheid. In 1978 his 47-year career in radio was hailed as the longest in world history. Like most of the world, Australia experienced great changes to broadcasting during the 1950s and 1960s. This was mainly caused by two things: the introduction of television and the gradual replacement of the radio valve with the transistor. Mainstream television transmission commenced in Sydney and Melbourne just in time for the Melbourne Olympic Games in November/December 1956. It was then phased in at other capital cities, and then into rural markets. Many forms of entertainment, particularly drama and variety, proved more suited to television than radio, so the actors and producers migrated there. The transistor radio first appeared on the market in 1954. In particular, it made portable radios even more transportable. All sets quickly became smaller, cheaper and more convenient. The aim of radio manufacturers became a radio in every room, in the car, and in the pocket. The upshot of these two changes was that stations started to specialise and concentrate on specific markets. The first areas to see specialised stations were the news and current affairs market, and stations specialising in pop music and geared toward the younger listener who was now able to afford his/her own radio. Talkback was to become a major radio genre by the end of the 1960s, but it was not legalised in Australia until October 1967.Changing Stations ‚Äì The Story of Australian Commercial Radio, Bridget Griffen-Foley, Sydney, 2009 The fears of intrusion were addressed by a beep that occurred every few seconds, so that the caller knew that his/her call was being broadcast. There was also a seven-second delay so that obscene or libelous material could be monitored. By the end of the 1960s, specialisation by radio stations had increased dramatically and there were stations focusing on various kinds of music, talkback, news, sport, etc.  The 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s  After much procrastination on the part of various federal governments, FM broadcasting was eventually introduced in 1975. (There had been official experiments with FM broadcasting as far back as 1948.) Only a handful of radio stations were given new licences during the 1940s, 1950s & 1960s but, since 1975, many hundreds of new broadcasting licences have been issued on both the FM and AM bands. In the latter case, this was made possible by having 9 kHz between stations, rather than 10 kHz breaks, as per the Geneva Frequency Plan. The installation of directional aerials also encouraged more AM stations. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation logo, first introduced in 1975 and based on the Lissajous curve. The types of station given FM licences reflects the policies and philosophies of the various Australian governments. Initially, only the ABC and community radio stations were granted FM licences. However, after a change of government, commercial stations were permitted on the band, as from 1980. At first, one or two brand new stations were permitted in each major market. However, in 1990, one or two existing AM stations in each major market were given FM licences; the stations being chosen by an auction system. Apart from an initial settling-in period for those few stations transferred from AM to FM, there has been no simulcasting between AM and FM stations. In major cities, a number of brand new FM licences were issued in the 1990s and 2000s. All rural regions which traditionally had only one commercial station now have at least one AM and one FM commercial station. In many cases, the owner of the original station now has at least two outlets. The number of regional transmitters for the ABC's five networks also increased dramatically during this era.  The 2000s  The \\"Kerbango Internet Radio\\" was the first stand- alone product that let users listen to Internet radio without a computer. From August 2009, digital radio was phased in by geographical region. Today, the ABC, SBS, commercial and community radio stations operate on the AM and FM bands. Most stations are available on the internet and most also have digital outlets. By 2007, there were 261 commercial stations in Australia. The ABC currently has five AM/FM networks and is in the process of establishing a series of supplementary music stations that are only available on digital radios and digital television sets. SBS provides non-English language programs over its two networks, as do a number of community radio stations. Political issues  Dual system Australia faced the choice between the American system of privately owned radio stations with minimal government control, favoured by the Liberal Party, or a government run system as exemplified by the British BBC, favoured by the Labor Party. The result was a compromise and Australia's dual radio broadcasting system comprises two parts. The \\"Public\\" sector (Class A stations), operated by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), which is modeled after the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). This sector was originally funded by listener licence fees. However, all licence fees were abolished in 1974 by the Australian Labor Party government led by Gough Whitlam on the basis that the near-universality of television and radio services meant that public funding was a fairer method of providing revenue for government-owned radio and television broadcasters. The ABC since then has been funded by government grants, plus its own commercial activities (merchandising, overseas sale of programmes, etc.) The \\"Commercial\\" sector (Class B stations) consists of privately owned radio stations, which may operate within \\"Networks\\". The two major, early commercial networks, Macquarie and Major were modeled after the American system and funded through advertising revenue. By 2007, there were 261 commercial radio stations.Greg Mundy, \\"'Free-Enterprise' or 'Public Service'? The Origins of Broadcasting in the U.S., U.K. and Australia\\", Australian & New Zealand Journal of Sociology (1982) 18#3 pp: 279‚Äì301 Politics on the air Both Labor and Liberal politicians who visited the United States were highly impressed with the rapidly growing importance of political broadcasts. The 1931 national election was the first to feature heavy use of political broadcasts. Labor Prime Minister James Scullin was in a difficult contest, and he realized that radio receivers were now widespread, and the medium was much more effective and much cheaper than stumping in person using long-distance train travel. The New South Wales Labor Party leader Jack Lang emulated President Roosevelt's \\"fireside chat\\" format. Liberals followed suit; Robert Menzies based his 1949 Liberal campaign around radio broadcasts.Ian Ward, \\"The early use of radio for political communication in Australia and Canada: John Henry Austral, Mr Sage and the Man from Mars\\", Australian Journal of Politics & History (1999) 45#3 pp 311‚Äì30. online During the Second World War, Prime Minister Curtin made very heavy use of newspapers and broadcast media, especially through press conferences, speeches, and newsreels. Australians gained a sense it was a people's war in which they were full participants.Caryn Coatney, \\"John Curtin's Forgotten Media Legacy: The Impact of a Wartime Prime Minister on News Management Techniques, 1941‚Äì45\\", Labour History (2013), Issue 105, pp 63‚Äì78. online After numerous short-lived experiments in the states, Parliament began radio broadcasts of its proceedings in 1946.Ian Ward, \\"Parliament on 'the Wireless' in Australia\\", Australian Journal of Politics & History (2014) 60$2 pp 157‚Äì176.

In particular, the program \\"Four Corners favoured the viewpoint of the antiwar and anticonscription movements. Political scientists have suggested that television coverage has subtly transformed the political system, with a spotlight on leaders rather than parties, thereby making for more of an American-presidential-style system. In the 2001 Federal election, television news focused on international issues, especially terrorism and asylum seekers. The September 11 attacks three weeks earlier had dominated the news. Minor parties were largely ignored as the two main parties monopolized the camera's attention. The election was depicted as a horse race between the Coalition's John Howard, who ran ahead and was therefore given more coverage than his Labor rival Kim Beazley.David Denemark, Ian Ward, and Clive Bean, Election Campaigns and Television News Coverage: The Case of the 2001 Australian Election.

Critics favoured the supposedly superior traditional culture of the mother country, which appealed to upscale audiences that were representative of the nation's elite. Richard Boyer (1891‚Äì1961), chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, fought against commercialism because he feared it would lead to American dominance. He held that the BBC model of a publicly owned and operated television would sustain Australia's British heritage.Simon J.

Multiculturalism The arrival of large numbers of new immigrants after 1945, along with a radical revision of attitudes toward nonwhite groups, produced pressures on the government regarding broadcasting access. Demands led to the creation of the Special Broadcasting Service, a publicly funded broadcaster mandated to provide multicultural and multilingual programming. In Canada, by contrast, the government stood apart and multicultural or multilingual program was provided by the private sector.

Television As early as 1929, two Melbourne commercial radio stations, 3UZ and 3DB were conducting experimental mechanical television broadcasts ‚Äì these were conducted in the early hours of the morning, after the stations had officially closed down. In 1934 Dr Val McDowallhttps://www.racp.edu.au/page/library/college-roll/college- roll-detail&id;=496 at amateur station 4CM Brisbanehttps://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:212637/s00855804_1961_1962_6_4_750.pdf, conducted experiments in electronic television. Television broadcasting officially began in 1956 and has since expanded to include a broad range of public, commercial, community, subscription, narrowcast, and amateur stations across the country. Colour television in the PAL 625-line format went to a full-time basis in 1975. Subscription television, on the Galaxy platform, began in 1995. Digital terrestrial television was introduced in 2001.Albert Moran and Chris Keating. The A to Z of Australian Radio and Television (Scarecrow Press, 2009) ABC: The national system The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), established in 1929, is Australia's state- owned and funded national public broadcaster. With a total annual budget of A$1.22 billion,Retrieved 4 December 2013 Budget Paper No. 4 2012‚Äì2013 the corporation provides television, radio, online and mobile services throughout metropolitan and regional Australia, as well as overseas through the Australia Network and Radio Australia and is well regarded for quality and reliability as well as for offering educational and cultural programming that the commercial sector would be unlikely to supply on its own. 1920s‚Äì40s ABC mobile studio caravan, used for concerts presented by the ABC at army camps and other locations, 1940 The first public radio station in Australia opened in Sydney on 23 November 1923 under the call sign 2SB with other stations in Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and Hobart following. A licensing scheme, administered by the Postmaster-General's Department, was soon established allowing certain stations government funding, albeit with restrictions placed on their advertising content. Following a 1927 royal commission inquiry into radio licensing issues, the government established the National Broadcasting Service which subsequently took over a number of the larger funded stations. It also nationalised the Australian Broadcasting Company which had been created by entertainment interests to supply programs to various radio stations. On 1 July 1932, the Australian Broadcasting Commission was established, taking over the operations of the National Broadcasting Service and eventually establishing offices in each of Australia's capital cities. Over the next four years the stations were reformed into a cohesive broadcasting organisation through regular program relays, coordinated by a centralised bureaucracy. The Australian broadcast radio spectrum was constituted of the ABC and the commercial sector. Cater argues that reform was urgently needed in 1945: : By the end of World War II, the ABC was a decadent, hollow institution. Its authority had been compromised by a poorly drafted charter and further undermined by timid management, poor governance and creeping wartime censorship. In April 1945, Boyer refused to accept the post of chairman until Prime Minister Curtin issued a mandate of independence which Boyer drafted himself. The ABC under Boyer and general manager Charles Moses invested as best it could in the cultural capital of the nation, establishing viable symphony orchestras and seizing on the potential of television.... [Boyer's] neutrality was never seriously questioned.Nick Cater, The Lucky Culture and the Rise of an Australian Ruling Class (2013) p 201 1950s‚Äì70s The first broadcast of ABC TV ‚Äì presented by Michael Charlton, 5 November 1956 The ABC began television broadcasting in 1956 ABN-2 (New South Wales) Sydney was inaugurated by Prime Minister Robert Menzies on 5 November 1956.Australian Broadcasting Corporation, \\"About the ABC: History of the ABC: James Dibble\\".

Until then, news bulletins were sent to each TV station. Popular programs at the time included Six O'Clock Rock hosted by Johnny O'Keefe, Mr. Squiggle, as well as operas and plays. Rugby was first broadcast in 1973. Colour was introduced in 1975. ABC budget cuts began in 1976 and continued until 1985, leading to some short strikes. The budget cuts crippled the network for years.\\"Molomby, Tom, Is there a moderate on the roof? ABC Years, William Heinemann Australia, Port Melbourne, 1991, p.160 Many Australian households quickly rearranged their dining habits so the family could watch television together at tea time. The lounge typically became the TV room. Magazines published advice on preparing meals to be taken in front of the television. Stores began to carry new products such as vinyl furniture, frozen dinners, tray tables, and plastic dishes. 1980s‚Äì90s Starting with its new name in 1983, the \\"Australian Broadcasting Corporation\\" underwent significant restructuring. The ABC was split into separate television and radio divisions, with an overhaul of management, finance, property and engineering. Program production was expanded in indigenous affairs, comedy, drama, social history and current affairs. Local production trebled from 1986 to 1991 with the assistance of co-production, co-financing, and pre-sales arrangements. A new Concert Music Department was formed in 1985 to coordinate the corporation's six symphony orchestras, which in turn received a greater level of autonomy to better respond to local needs. Open-air free concerts and tours, educational activities, and joint ventures with other music groups were undertaken at the time to expand the orchestras' audience reach. ABC Radio was restructured significantly again in 1985 ‚Äì Radio One became the Metropolitan network, while Radio 2 became known as Radio National (callsigns, however, were not standardised until 1990). New programs such as The World Today, Australia All Over, and The Coodabeen Champions were introduced, while ABC-FM established an Australian Music Unit in 1989. Radio Australia began to focus on the Asia-Pacific region, with coverage targeted at the south west and central Pacific, south-east Asia, and north Asia. Radio Australia also carried more news coverage, with special broadcasts during the 1987 Fijian coup, Tiananmen Square massacre, and the First Gulf War. Ultimo. The ABC Multimedia Unit was established in July 1995, to manage the new ABC website (launched in August). Funding was allocated later that year specifically for online content, as opposed to reliance on funding for television and radio content. The first online election coverage was put together in 1996, and included news, electorate maps, candidate information and live results. By the early 1990s, all major ABC broadcasting outlets moved to 24-hour-a-day operation, while regional radio coverage in Australia was extended with 80 new transmitters. International television service Australia Television International was established in 1993, while at the same time Radio Australia increased its international reach. Reduced funding in 1997 for Radio Australia resulted in staff and programming cuts. Australia Television was sold to the Seven Network in 1998; however, the service continued to show ABC news and current affairs programming up until its closure in 2001. The ABC's television operation joined its radio and online divisions at the corporation's Ultimo headquarters in 2000. 2000s In 2001, digital television commenced after four years of preparation. In readiness, the ABC had fully digitised its production, post-production and transmission facilities. The ABC's Multimedia division was renamed \\"ABC New Media\\", becoming an output division of the ABC alongside Television and Radio. Legislation allowed the ABC to provide 'multichannels' ‚Äì additional, digital-only, television services managed by the New Media Division. Soon after the introduction of digital television in 2001, Fly TV and the ABC Kids channel launched, showing a mix of programming aimed at teenagers and children. In 2002, the ABC launched ABC Asia Pacific ‚Äì the replacement for the defunct Australia Television International operated previously by the Seven Network. Much like its predecessor, and companion radio network Radio Australia, the service provided a mix of programming targeted at audiences throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Funding cuts in 2003 led to the closure of Fly TV and the ABC Kids channel. The ABC launched a digital radio service, ABC DiG, in November 2002, available through the internet and digital television, but not available through any other terrestrial broadcast until DAB+ became available in 2009. ABC2, a second attempt at a digital-only television channel, was launched on 7 March 2005. By 2006 ABC2 carried comedy, drama, national news, sport and entertainment. 2010s ABC News 24 launched on 22 July 2010, and brought with it both new programming content as well as a collaboration of existing news and current affair productions and resources. The ABC launched the 24-hour news channel to both complement its existing 24-hour ABC News Radio service and compete with commercial offerings on cable TV. It became the ABC's fifth domestic TV channel and the fourth launched within the past 10 years.

Biography Born Ellen Walsh to Irish immigrant peddler, she changed her name to Ida E. Mayfield and moved to New York City in 1857 at the age of 19. She set her sights on 37-year-old Benjamin Wood, a married politician and businessman, who co-owned the New York Daily News. She boldly propositioned him in a letter dated May 28 and soon became his mistress; they had an illegitimate daughter, Emma Wood. Ida claimed her father was Henry Mayfield, a Louisiana sugar planter. After Wood's second wife died, they married in 1867.Benjamin Wood Dead, New-York Tribune, 22 February 1900, p. 5. Her husband was the publisher of the New York Daily News, three- time member of Congress and two-time member of the New York State Senate. As his wife, she gained entry into the elite level of New York society; she danced with the Prince of Wales in 1860 and met Abraham Lincoln. Her brother- in-law was Fernando Wood, twice mayor of New York City and three-time member of the House of Representatives. Benjamin was an inveterate gambler, however. He once even wagered the Daily News; luckily he won. Ida, on the other hand, was very careful with money. She got her husband to agree to split his winnings with her, while he was responsible for all of his losses. By the time he died in 1900, she already had possession of essentially all of his wealth by this means. She herself edited and published the newspaper for a while, but then sold it in 1901 for more than $250,000 or around $300,000. In 1907, she closed her bank account, taking out nearly $1 million. Then Ida, her sister Mary E. Mayfield, and her daughter Emma took a two-room suite at the Herald Square Hotel, room 552, and became recluses. They had little contact with anyone, even hotel employees, for decades. Maids were not permitted inside to clean the rooms. Emma died in the hospital in 1928 at the age of 71. Then, when Mary became very ill, on May 5, 1931, Ida was finally forced to summon help. This intrusion turned out badly for Ida. Mary died, and people became aware of the squalor in which Ida lived. They also discovered how rich she was.Renee M. Winters. The Hoarding Impulse: Suffocation of the Soul. Routledge, 2015. In the midst of the Great Depression, her relatives and their lawyers battled to gain control of her wealth. She was declared incompetent in September 1931 and moved one floor down to two other rooms over her objections. Many hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and other valuables were found in her suite and in trunks stored in the hotel basement. More than $3000 a month was spent on her care and protection. After she died on March 12, 1932 of bronchial pneumonia, at the age of 93, no fewer than 1103 claimants squabbled over the distribution of her estate. The truth about her past emerged after six month from her death told by Edward T. Corcoran, a lawyer, later confirmed by Joseph A.

Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a young Spanish girl waiting the return of her lover from war. The painting is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Description  Washington Allston painted The Spanish Girl in Reverie in 1831 after being inspired by a poem he wrote, titled The Spanish Maid. The painting portrays a young Spanish woman, \\"Sweet Inez\\", waiting for her lover Isidore to return from war. Inez is tentatively perched on an earth incline, the spot where she and Isidore were previously betrothed. The nature of her daydreaming is reflected in her face and body language; her emotions range shift between excitement, yearning, hope and fear as she waits for her lover to make an appearance. Though she is the clear focus of the painting, she is dwarfed by the mountains to her back, which add to the gravity of the scene and emulate the sense of distance between the two lovers. Her muted red dress starkly contrasts with the dull (described by the Metropolitan Museum of Art as \\"diaphanous\\") colors of the landscape, and the hard lines that make up her outline stand out from the softer lines of the mountains and trees. Allston also paid close attention to the foreground of the painting, where he rendered detailed depictions of soil and plants.

Publication history Mike Singleton moderated Starlord using his Commodore PET. Starlord was based on a 1977 board game of the same name invented by Gary Bedrosian and Lee Elmendorf. Gameplay The game depicted a galactic empire on the decline, in a 1000-star galaxy, in which 50 players took the part of \\"starlords\\" trying to become emperor by conquering the Throne Star. At the outset, players controlled one Base Star out of 1,000 available. The \\"Empyr\\" controlled the non-assigned stars, \\"with up to ten ships at each and several hundred at the central Throne Star\\". However, \\"sadly, the last Emperor has died, and the Empyr is run by imperial computers\\", proving an opportunity for players to seize the throne. A player that took the Throne Star received various benefits, including control of the Empyr's forces and free turns, but also acquired \\"up to 49 enemies\\". Lee Simpson noted in the Winter 1983 issue of Flagship magazine that \\"Mike Singleton has since admitted, in earlier Starlord games the Throne Star was initially too lightly garrisoned\\", allowing players to become Emperor early in the game. Reception W.G. Armintrout reviewed Starlord in The Space Gamer No. 49. Armintrout commented that \\"In my opinion, Starlord is one of the top five PBM games going. I highly recommend it to all gamers, even those who have never yet tried this type of game.\\" In the April 1983 edition of Dragon (Issue 72), Michael Gray stated \\"A player who becomes Emperor early in a game, and is then dethroned and eliminated, may still win the game by accumulating lots of points during his or her reign.

The property is owned by the Yaegl Local Aboriginal Land Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 December 2004.  History  Ulgundahi Island has been a site of occupation since 1880 when many Aboriginal people retreated to the island when Europeans had introduced diseases and the land had been taken up by European farms. In 1904, a portion of Ulgundahi Island was gazetted as an Aboriginal reserve under the control of the Aboriginal Protection Board (APB) and in 1907 the whole of the island was included in the Reserve. The name Ulgundahi Island, is to have come from a Yaegl word meaning \\"shape of an ear\\". Several families already resided on the island and it was reported in 1904 that eight acres be set aside for a Reserve and that supplies of roofing iron and tanks should be delivered immediately.McSwan 1992:322 Concerns by European residents had been expressed about Aboriginal camps on the fringes of nearby townships and in 1908 the APB relocated families from Ashby onto Ulgundahi Island increasing the resident population to 60. In 1909, Aboriginal people from Harwood Island fled to Ulgundahi Island due to a European farmer burning down the camp of more than 40 bark dwellings.Heron 1991:16, Ledgar 5-6 The basis of settlement at the island was farming, each head of a family having an average of about three to four acres, while child endowment of 5/weekly was paid in respect of each child under the required age, and there was a scale of rations to the extent of 10/ weekly for those who need it, with two outfits of clothing and a blanket yearly for each person.Daily Examiner, 13 June 1936 The allocation of 3-4 acres to each family to cultivate for maize, cane and vegetables, no doubt to encourage industry any surplus produce could be sold.McEwan 1992:322 Rations were supplied for children but not to adults as a rule. For any adult that wasn't able to earn sufficient, the following weekly ration was provided with a half a ration for each child: - Flour, 8 lbs; sugar, 2 lbs; jam 4oz; dripping, 8oz; potatoes, 2 lbs; onions, 8ozs; baking powder, 4ozs. The APB provided clothes which were all the same, black trousers and blue shirts for boys and purple dresses for the girls and no shoes. Medicine was given by the Manager, regardless if it was needed or wanted, quinine, caster oil, cod liver oil and kerosine were some things given regularly.Smith 1990:17 In 1908, the APB appointed a European manager who was also to be the school teacher to Ulgundahi Island, who resided at Ashby and attended the island each day by boat. In the same year the Aboriginal Provisional School was established on the Island and other buildings included a building, outhouses and a tank. A number of children from the island attended the Maclean School and it was said that parents of European children attending the school objected to the Aboriginal children from Ulgundahi being allowed to go to the same school. There was very little taught to the children of the island. In 1910 a small church was built by the residents of the island. A report in January 1921 states that Mr John Cameron paid the balance of funds needed and furnished the church. Until 1910 the minister Rev. Scott Neil visited the island regularly to take services. His sister took Sunday School classes and became involved with the welfare of the women and children. Other denominations became involved from time to time, especially the Baptists, Free Presbyterians and Salvation Army. An organ was later provided which was played by Mrs Blakeney. The families were not compelled to remain on the island by the authorities, though with a hostile European society and the power of the manager to allocate an absent family residence to others, these were enough reasons as to what influenced people to remain on the island. There was conflict between isolation and assimilation as the children were trained only for employment for the white community as farm labourers for the boys or in domestic service for the girls. Men would harvest the cane and take it to Harwood mill. Each home on the island had its own fruit - peaches, oranges, mangoes, passionfruit and grapes. Those who had vegetable gardens would pick and prepare them for the markets. Any money that was earnt from the sales of either cane or vegetables all went back to the APB, never to the person who sold it. It was reported in 1911 by the APB that this goal had practically been achieved, with only one person in receipt of rations. Continual flooding of the island, caused the state authorities to question the viability of the settlement. The 1921 flood a been a bad experience. Families were often left to fend for themselves for up to three months at a time. Further floods occurred in 1928 and several during the 1940-1950. In 1951 the government school was closed and children were required to go by boat to Maclean to attend school. In 1958 the APB manager retired, and was not replaced. Yaegl families often moved to places off the island for holidays or camps lasting from one to two weeks to an entire summer. A popular destination was known as Murrayville, a tributary of the north arm of the Clarence River. Families would often camp for six weeks at a time, and were drawn to the abundance of \\"wild food\\" known as \\"cobra\\" or wood worms. Ashby was another camp used, especially during times of flooding of the island. Yamba was also a popular place for families to visit for the entire summer months to exploit the food resources of the coast and waters. By 1961, the residential focus of Aboriginal families had shifted from Ulgundahi Island to Aboriginal reserves in Yamba and Maclean. The Aboriginal families living on Ulgundahi Island were governed by the APB for approximately half a century, until the withdrawal of the APB towards the end of the 1950s. In 1956 the Hillcrest Aboriginal Reserve was created on land on the edge of Maclean, and several houses were built for families who wished to move. By 1962, the last Aboriginal families had left the island to take up residence at Hillcrest.  Description  Surviving building built of corrugated iron Located within the Clarence River, Ulgundahi Island is approximately 14.16 hectares in land size and approximately 1.5 km long. The western end of the island continues to change shape due to the silt build up. Cardy Craig and first wife Sarah Blakey were first Aborigine to own home/land in 1909. After Sarah died in 1927, Cardy remarried to Lena Khan. Since then Craig family have relocated south. During the years of control by the APB, the Aboriginal people were allowed to farm crops of cane, corn and vegetables. Today, parts of the island are still being used by the local Aboriginal community for its farming purposes. Overgrown structure There are two remaining structures, though in poor state, one located in the northwest end of the island the other towards the southeast side. The main structure on the northwest side, is said to be the first house built on the Mission. The condition of the structure, is poor. Made of corrugated iron, it still retains the original flooring of timber and clear of being taken over by vines. The other structure, also built of corrugated iron does not appear to have a roof, though its walls are still standing. Its condition is poor and covered in vines. Fig tree A new structure now stands on Ulgundahi Island, and acts as an undercover area. This allows school groups and members of the community to come and sit and Ulgundahi Island. A symbolic item still remains on the island, that being the large fig tree which is located towards the Western end of the island. Fig trees have a special significance to the Yaegl community. It is said that fig trees hold spirits and must not be disturbed. The island continues to be modified due to the continuation of farming. The community also have future plans to include interpretation and signage and undertake conservation works to the old houses.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Ulgundahi Island and its surrounding waters is highly significant to the cultural, social, spiritual and heritage values of the Yaegl people and other Aboriginal people who have a strong association with the island. Ulgundahi Island was gazetted as an Aboriginal Reserve in 1904 and became home to most of the local Aborigines living in camps scattered about the fringes of Maclean and Lower Clarence Region including Southgate, Ashby, Lawrence and Ulmarra. Being one of many Mission sites across NSW, its social significance relates to the associations with the Aboriginal Protection Board removing Aboriginal people from local towns and cities in an attempt to abolish all traces of Aboriginality. Today the island and its significance to the cultural and heritage values remains strong for the Yaegl people and other Aboriginal people who have an association with the island. The island continues to be utilised by the Yaegl community for uses such as educational tours and organic farming. Ulgundahi Island was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 December 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Ulgundahi Island was gazetted as an Aboriginal Reserve in 1904 when Aboriginal families were moved to the island from settlements all over the Lower Clarence region including Southgate, Ashby, Lawrence and Ulmarra. By 1905 there were 21 people living on the island. The site is of state significance as it is able to demonstrate evidence of occupational living by these groups through the associations that still exist today with the Yaegl people of Maclean. Members of the Yaegl community and descendants of those of the original families placed on the island have a strong connection to the land and its surrounding waters. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Ulgundahi Island has a strong and special association for its social, cultural, heritage and spiritual values for the Yaegl people and other Aboriginal people of the lower Clarence region. The area is well known for its dreaming stories of the making of the Clarence River by the wicked old woman of the Creation period, Dirrangun. The island became a focal point for all the communities in the area: people were born, married and died in this place and every one of them is remembered by today's Aboriginal community. For the Aboriginal people of today who have an association to the island, it holds a special place as a symbol of their changing place in history and their ability to not only survive all the injustices they suffered, but to come out of if stronger, and more aware of their culture and their place in the landscape of this region. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Ulgundahi Island and the surrounding waters is highly significant to the Yaegl people and other Aboriginal people associated to the island to their cultural heritage values. The area is outstanding as it is able to demonstrate a particular way of life and custom of the Yaegl people and other Aboriginal people who lived on the island. Although there are no physical buildings remaining, except for the skeletal structure of the first house built on the island, and a smaller skeletal structure covered in vine, the connection to land and its spiritual and cultural values are held high within the community.

He was the father of music producer Jimmy Miller and of The New York Times reporter Judith Miller. Biography Miller was born to a Jewish family in Pinsk, Russia, in 1904, the son of Lena and David Miller. He did not know his family's original surname. The family immigrated to the United States when William was a year old, first settling in Brooklyn, New York, and then Jersey City, New Jersey. His father worked as a building tradesman, and he had one sister, Mollie Miller Vine. Miller dropped out of high school after two years to pursue a career as a vaudeville dancer as part of the duo Miller and Peterson. He danced professionally until he was 30, after which he worked as a vaudeville agent. He became an entrepreneur operating the original Luna Park in Coney Island. In 1945, he purchased the Riviera, a nightclub overlooking the Hudson River in Fort Lee, New Jersey, which had closed during World War II, and renamed it Bill Miller's Riviera. He booked many of the top acts at the time including Tony Martin, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop, Mae West, and Tito Puente. In 1953, the Riveria was shuttered to make way for the Palisades Parkway. Also in 1953, Miller purchased a 10% interest in the Sahara hotel and casino and moved to Las Vegas at the invitation of Milton Prell (who had founded the Sahara in 1952), becoming its entertainment director. Starting afresh, as many of his former acts had already been taken to Las Vegas by former Copacabana Club employee, Jack Entratter, he hired Ray Bolger, Donald O'Conner, and Marlene Dietrich. He also pioneered the Las Vegas lounge show concept, booking Louis Prima, Keely Smith, and Sam Butera. In 1955, Miller left the Sahara and bought an interest in the new Dunes hotel and casino, where he again worked as the entertainment director. At the Dunes, he developed the first of the big Las Vegas production \\"feathershows\\", named Smart Affairs, and later developed burlesque shows Lido de Paris and the Folies Bergere with his former producer in New Jersey, Donn Arden. Miller operated a hotel in the Dutch West Indies, before returning to Las Vegas where he served as the entertainment director of the Flamingo (founded by Kirk Kerkorian), where he helped to launch the career of Sonny and Cher with Phil Spector. In 1969, Miller worked at Kerkorian's new hotel, The International, where he booked Barbara Striesand and revived the career of Elvis Presley. The International became the world's largest resort hotel during his tenure. Miller retired in the 1970s. Personal life Miller died on December 9, 2002, in Palm Springs, California, at the age of 98. Miller married four times. He was survived by his fourth wife, Denise B. Miller. He had three children, record producer and musician Jimmy Miller (who predeceased him in the 1990s and was previously married to Australian television personality, actress and singer Kerri-Anne Wright), reporter Judith Miller of The New York Times (married to editor Jason Epstein), and Susan Miller; and a stepson, Jerry Johnson.

Design and gameplay Federation Space was designed by Stephen Wilcox as a strategic companion to the more tactical Star Fleet Battles system. The game components are: * 20\\" x 24\\" hex grid map * 432 back-printed die-cut cardboard counters * fleet organization charts * combat results table * 16-page rulebook The map covers the large extent of space and many of the space-faring races described in the Star Trek TV series. This included the Federation, Klingons, Romulans, Gorns, Tholians and Hydrans. The Kzinti, a race mentioned in the Ringworld novels of Larry Niven, is also featured. This is a game of naval fleet action involving dozens (or more) ships. Nearly all ships move at the same speed (Warp Factor 6). With so many ships involved, combat relies on a simple two-step reduction system to determine damage. Each ship only has two statuses: normal (counter face up); and damaged (counter face-down). Taking any damage results in a ship receiving the \\"Damaged\\" status. Taking any subsequent damage destroys the ship. Battles continue until one side is either destroyed or withdraws. Since this is a strategic-level game, some scenarios describe the capture of base stations, starbases or even planets. There is also a campaign game for three or more players (each playing a different race) in which the players use diplomatic alliances and multiple navies to achieve their strategic goals. Reception In the March 1982 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 49), William A. Barton recommended the game, saying, \\"Federation Space succeeds in its purpose to present a relatively simple, playable Star Trek game which can serve as a strategic module for Star Fleet Battles. Recommended to Trek gamers everywhere.\\" John Lambshead reviewed Federation Space for White Dwarf #31, giving it an overall rating of 8 out of 10, and stated that \\"So to sum up: a reasonably buy for megalomaniacs who like to rule the universe, a good buy for Star Trek fans, and an essential buy for Star Fleet Battles enthusiasts.\\" In the August 1983 edition of Dragon (Issue 76), Tony Watson liked a number of things, including its simplicity of rules and combat, the fleet organization charts, the simple step-reduction damage system, and the colourful components. Watson criticized the size of the map, which although large compared to other combat games, was too small and restrictive for entire fleets. Watson also thought the game did not reward clever fleet maneuvers, relying instead on massed fleets simply engaging head on. He concluded, \\"Federation Space has much to recommend itself. Both those who play Starfleet Battles and those interested in a fast-moving, action-oriented strategic space game should find this title to their liking.\\" References Category:Board games based on Star Trek Category:Board games introduced in 1981 Category:Star Fleet Battles ","title":"Federation Space"},{"id":"57795936","text":"Helltank is a 1981 board game published by Metagaming Concepts.

It is used to enhance the experience for the end user in comparison to only using cloud computing. Dew computing attempts to solve major problems related to cloud computing technology, such as reliance on internet access. Dropbox is an example of the dew computing paradigm, as it provides access to the files and folders in the cloud in addition to keeping copies on local devices. This allows the user to access files during times without an internet connection; when a connection is established again, files and folders are synchronized back to the cloud server.  History  The term \\"dew computing\\", as used in information technology, first appeared in 2015 in IT literature and since then has become a field of its own. The cloud-dew architecture was proposed as a possible solution to the offline data accessibility problem. At first, its scope included only web applications; broader applications were later proposed.Skala, Karolj; Davidoviƒá, Davor; Afgan, Enis; Soviƒá, Ivan; ≈†ojat, Zorislav: Scalable Distributed Computing Hierarchy: Cloud, Fog and Dew Computing // Open Journal of Cloud Computing (OJCC), 2 (2015), 1; 16-24 doi:10.19210/1002.2.1.16 Dew computing is a model which was derived from the original concept of cloud computing. Other models have also emerged from cloud computing, including fog computing, edge computing, dew computing, and others. Proponents claim that these novel models, such as dew computing, can provide better experiences for users. Cloud computing provides universal access and scalability. However, having all the resources far from a user's control occasionally causes problems. In the classic cloud computing paradigm, when the internet connection to the servers is lost, the user is unable to access their data; dew computing aims to solve this problem.  Definition  As an information technology paradigm, dew computing seeks to use the capabilities of personal computers along with cloud services in a more reliable manner. The key features of dew computing are independence and collaboration. Independence means that the local device must be able to provide service without a continuous connection to the Internet. Collaboration means that the application must be able to connect to the cloud service and synchronize data when appropriate. Use of the word \\"dew\\" reflects natural phenomena: clouds are far from the ground, fog is closer to the ground, and dew is on the ground. Analogically, cloud computing is a remote service, fog computing is beside the user, and dew computing is at the user end.  Architecture  DVM-cloud architecture To establish a cloud-dew architecture on a PC, a dew virtual machine (DVM) is needed. The DVM is an isolated environment for executing the dew server on the local PC, and it consists of at least three components: the dew server (DS), the data analytics server (DAS), and the artificial intelligence of the dew (AID). * Dew server (DS): The DS acts like the cloud service on the local PC. It interacts with and periodically synchronizes content with the cloud service. * Dew analytics server (DAS): The dew analytics server collects data about how the dew server is being used. * Artificial intelligence of the dew (AID): After receiving data from the DAS about usage patterns, the AID uses the data to customize and tailor the dew server to the user to enhance their experience.  Categories  The dew computing categories are classified based on the application field. * Web in Dew (WiD) ** The local device must possess a duplicated fraction of the World Wide Web (WWW) or a modified copy of that fraction to satisfy the independence feature. Because this fraction synchronizes with the web, it satisfies the collaboration feature of dew computing. * Storage in Dew (SiD) ** The storage of the local device is partially or fully copied into the cloud. An example is Dropbox, in which a user can create a folder in the cloud, and have access to the folder and its contents on the local device once synchronization is complete. Since the user can access files at any time without the need for constant Internet access, this category meets the independence feature of dew computing. SiD also meets the collaboration feature because the folder and its contents automatically synchronize with the cloud service. * Database in Dew (DBiD) ** The local device and the cloud both store copies of the same database. One of these two databases is considered the main version and can be defined as such by the database administrator. This service increases the reliability of a database, as one of the databases can act as the backup for the other. * Software in Dew (SiD) ** The configuration and ownership of software are saved in the cloud. Examples include the Apple App Store and Google Play, where the applications the user installs are saved to their account and can then be installed on any device linked to their account. * Platform in Dew (PiD) ** A software development suite must be installed on the local device with the settings and application data synchronized to the cloud service. A Software Development Kit on its own does not satisfy these requirements; it must be able to synchronize development data, system deployment data, and online backups. An example of PiD is GitHub. * Infrastructure as Dew (IaD) ** The local device is dynamically supported by cloud services. IaD can come in different forms, but the following two forms can be used: (1) the local device can have an exact duplicate DVM instance in the cloud, which is always kept in the same state as the local instance, or (2) the local device can have all its settings/data saved in the cloud, including system settings/data and data for each application. * Data in Dew (DiD) ** The term DiD is applied when all its applications satisfy the independence and collaboration requirements but cannot be placed in any of the above categories. An example is the Novell Groupwise email client.  Possible challenges  Dew computing faces a number of technical challenges, including issues related to power management, processor utility, and data storage. Other factors impacting the use of dew computing are the viability of the operation system, network model, communication model, programming principles, dew recommended engine, local dew network, personal high productivity, database security, and behaviors of the browser.

Bhimsingh. The film featured Gemini Ganesan and Padmini in the lead roles.  Plot  Nagan is a farmer who owns a fertile farming land in Vayalur. Nagan is an honest and hardworking person who considers his farming land as his temple. Though the land is fertile, at times the yield is not so good. He has a son called Nallaan who is a brave and fearless young lad. Nagan decides to marry Nallaan to a girl called Muthamma.

Lafayette was born on March 18, 1840, one of eleven children born to Mary Ann Able and John Miller, a physician. He grew up in Buchanan County and graduated from Western College in Toledo, Iowa. After their marriage, Lafayette and Mary left Iowa to take advantage of the Homestead Act that promised 160 acres of unoccupied public land. The Millers joined a 50-wagon caravan on June 1, 1863 and traveled to Colorado in three or six covered wagons to Colorado. With them, they brought the region's first threshing machine and had twelve yoke of oxen. They traveled along the Smoky Hill Trail from Missouri to the Territory of Colorado. A couple of times they came under attack by Arapaho and Cheyenne. The Colorado War began within two months of their arrival in Colorado. Colorado pioneer Early years Horse team on the Overland Trail In September 1863, they settled along the St. Vrain Creek in Burlington (now Longmont) and lived in a log cabin. In 1865, the Millers moved to land patented by Mary Miller's brother, James B. Foote along Rock Creek in the area around the present-day Rock Creek Farm, near the intersection of Highway 287 and Dillon Road south of the present-day town of Lafayette. Together they purchased the Rock Creek House (later called the Miller Tavern) from Thomas J. Lindsey in 1865. Lindsey acquired the tavern from \\"Dr. Dow\\" and built a hotel next to Rock Creek House in 1863. They also established a cattle ranch, farm, and orchard. The Miller Tavern, which Mary Miller described as a \\"road house\\" (a drinking establishment) in a November 29, 1912 interview in the Boulder County Miner, was located on the Cherokee Trail along the Denver-Cheyenne route of Ben Holladay's Overland Mail and Express Company, which later became Wells Fargo Mail's stagecoach line. Wells Fargo historians state that the Rock Creek House was never an official stop on the Overland or Wells Fargo stage line, but the stage coach may have stopped from time to time to offload passengers. According to Boulder County Commissioners' minutes of the July 3, 1866 meeting, Lafayette Miller and Thomas Lindsey were granted a saloon license for Rock Creek House, which required a $500 bond and a $50 annual renewal fee. The three entrepreneurs and saloon owners ‚Äî Lafayette, Mary, and James B. Foote ‚Äî also sold butter and eggs in Black Hawk. Poster for John Robinson Circus, 1900, Library of Congress The Rock Creek House served long distance travelers and freighters, and those traveling from Fort Collins to Denver for shopping excursions. Modern narratives state that when he was the Commanding General of the U.S. Army, Ulysses S. Grant stopped at Rock Creek House. In a 1912 interview, Mary Miller stated that in 1868 Ulysses S. Grant instead stopped at White Rock stage station 8 miles north of Rock Creek House in order to \\"drink from the old well.\\" In 1867 or 1869, she fed a 100-person troupe with the John Robinson Circus. She fed hot biscuits, canned vegetables, and milk to the first circus performers to visit Colorado. In March 1868, the Millers purchased 160 acres along Coal Creek, two miles north of Rock Creek House, for $500 from Denver coal speculators Francis P. Heatley and Edward Chase. This land would eventually become the town of Lafayette and was adjacent to 240 acres patented by Mary Miller's brothers, James B. and Samuel G. Foote, and her father, John B. Foote. Mary eventually acquired most of the 640 acres in Section 2, Township 1 South, Range 69 West. The farm was called Willow Glen Farm. The Willow Glen School was established in 1875 in the Coal Creek area and the Miller children attended the school from that time onward. Lafayette was one of the people that established the school. In 1868, Wells Fargo abandoned its stage stop at Church Ranch five miles south of Rock Creek house, and in 1869 sold its Denver to Cheyenne route, which was acquired by John Hughes. The construction of the Colorado Central Railroad meant that regional stagecoach service became less frequent. With the writing on the wall, in 1871 Millers and James B. Foote sold the Miller Tavern to Abner C. Goodhue. They resided to Erie for a short time, then moved to Boulder. In 1875, Wells Fargo stopped the rest of its stagecoach service. In the mid-1870s, Lafayette was an owner of two butcher shops and a liquor distributorship. He opened a butcher shop in Boulder on 14th Street with his brother-in-law, James B. Foote, and he built a retail store and opened another in Erie. The Millers owned a house in Boulder on Water Street, now Canyon Street. The men were town trustees there and Mary served on the school board. Mary may have run the farm and ranch while Lafayette ran the butcher shops, because the Miller children attended the Willow Glen School near their farm during this period. After her husband died in 1878, Miller ran the ranch with her six children. She had more than 100 head of cattle and horses and some pigs. She grew wheat, hay, corn, and oats on the land. She also produced raspberries, gooseberries, currents and grapes. Coal mining A vast coal vein was found in an area that included the Miller ranch in the mid-1870s. Having retained the mineral rights, she leased coal rights to coal prospector John H. Simpson, a British engineer from Cumberland who opened the Simpson Mine in 1888. She received 12.5 cents per ton in royalties for the lump coal that was mined on her property, and became wealthy from the mine's earnings. In January 1895, when a severe cold weather snap hit the Eastern Plains of Colorado, she secured from the Simpson Mine and shipped 175 railroad cars filled with donated coal. Town of Lafayette Miller House, 409 East Cleveland Street in Lafayette, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. With Boulder County Clerk and Recorder records show that on February 3, 1888, Mary Miller filed the first plat for the original 37-acre town of Lafayette, having subdivided part of her land into 144 commercial and residential lots. In 1889, Mary Miller replatted the town of Lafayette and created 353 lots on 89 acres. From 1888 to 1904, Mary Miller sold 190 Lafayette lots, 50 of them to women for as little as $1. Boulder County property records show Old Town lots, 50 feet by 140 feet, sold to men at an average price of about $90. The purchase price for lots sold to women averaged about $48. Deeds for the lots prohibited selling or giving away \\"spiritous, vinous or malt liquors,\\" which remained in effect until the early 1980s. The first houses were built in July 1888 in what is now called Old Town, located between Baseline Road and Emma Street and east of Public Road. The town was incorporated on November 9, 1889, and her son Thomas became its first mayor. She built a house in Lafayette and operated a school in her house on East Cleveland Street until she founded the town's first school. She established more neighborhoods in the town after subdividing more of her land. Using coal royalties and land sales proceeds, Mary Miller founded Lafayette Bank and Trust Company, also known as the Miller Bank, in 1900. It was the second bank she‚Äôd help form in the town, the first being the Farmers‚Äô & Miners‚Äô State Bank, which opened in 1892 and closed in 1894. Mary Miller‚Äôs partners in the Farmers‚Äô & Miners‚Äô State Bank were S.T. Hooper, C.C. Brown and G.C. Seaman. She established the Lafayette Bank and Trust Company with three of her sons ‚Äî Charles, Thomas, and James ‚Äî and was its president for many years. Although modern narratives state that Mary Miller was the first bank president \\"in the world,\\" the story originates in a Dec. 13, 1902 article in the Lafayette News which states that she was \\"the only woman in the United States known to be the president of a bank.\\" When miners went on strike, she deferred their mortgage payments and bought groceries for their miner's families. In 1914, the bank closed after giving a $90,000 loan to the United Mine Workers, which was not repaid. In addition to losing the bank, she also lost her life savings. In 1905-06, Mary Miller helped finance and manage a new flour mill, the Lafayette-Louisville Milling & Grain Company. Her partners for the new venture included son, James P. Miller, George Bermont, W.A. Burke, William Padfield, John Lipsey, Dr. Horace R. Burns, P.M. Peltier, J.O. Van Debergh and Denver businessman E.L. Milner who was the general manager of the mill. The mill was located on a Burlington railroad spur built for the mill in the 800 block of E. Baseline Road, about 200 feet west of today‚Äôs Lafayette Feed and Grain elevator. W.F. Wehman sold his grist mill to Lafayette-Louisville Milling & Grain Company in June 1905, about nine months before the new mill opened. The Milling & Grain Company flour mill produced its premium brand Silver Tip Flour and operated primarily on electricity provided by the Interurban Power Plant, one of the nation's first distributed power systems built on land that Mary Miller owned at today's Waneka Lake. Mary Miller sponsored a contest to name the premium brand flour in September 1905. The prize was 300 pounds of flour. Company ledgers show that Silver Tip Flour sold for about 12 cents per pound in 1906 and 1907. The Lafayette-Louisville Milling & Grain Company mill closed in the 1920s and burned down in 1935. Congregational Church, Lafayette, Colorado was founded in 1890. Miller provided most of the funds to establish the church, arranged for its construction, and paid the minister's salary for several years. and It is now the Mary Miller Theater. Over the years, she paid for the construction of churches and established the first school. She also helped organize local clubs and organizations, like the Order of the Eastern Star. She ran for senator and state treasurer for the Prohibition Party in 1900. She became president of School District #43, which later became the Broomfield School District. Personal life During their marriage, the Millers had six children. On May 28, 1878, her husband died at age 38 and obituaries attributed his death to \\"Bright's Disease of the kidneys coupled with derangement of the liver\\" (derangement being a respectful term used at the time to describe cirrhosis of the liver due to overconsumption of alcohol). After Lafayette's death, Mary ran the ranch. In 1887, her eleven- year-old son, Frank, died due to an illness. Her daughter Amelia died when she was twelve years old. She then had four sons, George, James, Thomas, and Charles. James attended University of Colorado and became an attorney and vice president of the bank. George established Lafayette Supply Company and was a farmer. Thomas became Lafayette's mayor and died in 1902 in a mining accident. Miller died on November 14, 1921. Rebecca Schwendler, chairwoman of the Lafayette Historic Preservation Board states, \\"It was remarkable what she did at a time when women didn't have very much of a voice... She had a business side and a soft side.\\" Places named for her * The Mary Miller trail, which goes around part of Stearns Lake in Lafayette. * Mary Miller Theater on East Simpson Street in Lafayette.

After the fall of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's administration in October 2000, a new transitional government was established that excluded the Radicals, and the party returned to opposition. Serbia's electoral system was reformed for the 2000 Serbian parliamentary election, with the entire country becoming a single electoral constituency and with parliamentary mandates being awarded to list candidates at the discretion of successful parties, without specific reference to numerical order.Serbia's Law on the Election of Representatives (2000) stipulated that parliamentary mandates would be awarded to electoral lists (Article 80) that crossed the electoral threshold (Article 81), that mandates would be given to candidates appearing on the relevant lists (Article 83), and that the submitters of the lists were responsible for selecting their parliamentary delegations within ten days of the final results being published (Article 84).

Together with John Rice Crowe, he founded Alten Copper Works in K√•fjord, Norway, later renamed the K√•fjord Copper Works. Henry Woodfall was born in Scotland in 1796, the son of the printer George Woodfall, whose business he inherited. After relocating to Norway, he had a relationship with a local woman, Ane Helene Johannesdotter Muotka, and their son Salamon Woodfall was born in 1831. As director of Alten Copper Works, Woodfall was skeptical of bringing labor from England because he believed that the work was better served by building up a permanent mining community with Norwegian workers. He was also concerned that the mining company should take care of the miners and their families, and together with Crowe he founded K√•fjord as a society with a number of welfare services for the growing local population. Woodfall died in Nice, France in 1869. The various mines in K√•fjord were named after the stakeholders in the copper works, and one of the mines was called the Woodfall Mine.

Activated in 1956 by order of Admiral Arleigh Burke, the unit is a mixed chorus principally charged with \\"perpetuating songs of the sea\\". History In 1956, Lt. Harold Fultz, then the U.S. Navy Band's assistant leader, organized a group from the United States Navy School of Music to sing chanteys and patriotic songs for the State of the Nation dinner. Admiral Arleigh Burke, then chief of naval operations, transferred the ensemble to the Navy Band, named them the Sea Chanters and tasked what was at the time the all-male chorus with \\"perpetuating the songs of the sea\\". In 1980, the group added women to their ranks for the first time. In subsequent years, the group would perform on \\"Larry King Live\\", \\"CBS This Morning\\", and at the premier of Pearl Harbor. They have also appeared with Perry Como, Marian Anderson, Kenny Rogers, and Lionel Richie. The Sea Chanters' 2016 performance of the Egyptian song ‚ÄúFeha Haga Helwa‚Äù, sung on the occasion of the official visit of Gen. Mahmoud Hegazy to the United States, was popularly received by Egyptian social media users who viewed it \\"thousands\\" of times and commented on its \\"almost perfect Arabic\\". September 11 memorial service On 14 September 2011, the Sea Chanters performed the \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" at the national memorial service for the September 11 attacks at the Washington National Cathedral, immediately following the eulogy by President of the United States George W. Bush. Prior to the memorial service, White House officials debated the wisdom of following Bush's speech with the \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" due to both the song's length, at five stanzas, and its lyrics which were \\"unabashedly militant\\", describing the \\"fateful lightning\\" of a \\"terrible, swift sword\\". Later, some officials of the Administration cited the performance by the Sea Chanters as an \\"awakening\\" of a need for war. Memorial Day observances in 2018 Organization During most of the year, the Sea Chanters are posted to the Washington, D.C. area to support state and Navy events, however, embark on a three-week United States tour annually. As of 2018, a majority of its 23 members held university degrees in music and are selected to the ensemble through a process of competitive audition.

Built between 1914 and 1917 in the Colonial Revival and Georgian Revival architectural styles, the houses currently serve residential functions.  History  Until the late 1800s the area that would become Roslyn Place was a lot owned by J.W. Friday. It included a single wooden house surrounded by four wooden outbuildings. By 1904 the property was owned by Thomas Rodd, and the adjacent land to the southwest was owned by M.W. Rodd and served as the home of the Rodd family. Thomas Rodd was born in London, England and immigrated to the United States at the age of 5, and he served as an officer in the Navy during the American Civil War.Thomas Rodd. The Book of Prominent Pennsylvanians: A Standard Reference. Pittsburg Leader. Leader Publ., 1913. Shortly afterwards he eventually joined the Pennsylvania Railroad Company where he would be appointed to chief engineer for all lines west of Pittsburgh in 1889. It was at this time that he moved to Pittsburgh, and the Rodd family quickly became members of Pittsburgh's social elite.Chief Engineer Thomas Rodd, Pittsburgh Daily Post, April 14, 1900. He joined the Pittsburgh Club, the Duquesne Club, the Allegheny County Club, the Pittsburgh Golf Club, the University Club of Pittsburgh, the Metropolitan Club of New York, and the Chicago Club.Sport at the Links, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, July 18, 1898. The Rodd family was of such social status that even their vacations and work travel were reported in prominent newspapers.Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Rodd, The Pittsburgh Press, July 3, 1894.Lakewood is Booming, The Pittsburgh Press, July 11, 1897.White Sulpher Springs, The Pittsburgh Press, August 24, 1896.Capt. And Mrs. J.J. Vandergrift, The Pittsburgh Press, February 15, 1897. Thomas Rodd also played a role in the construction of many buildings in western Pennsylvania and the Midwest, and he was responsible for designing and constructing Roslyn Place. Rodd was also responsible for constructing the historic street which the houses sat on, also called Roslyn Place. In 1914 construction began when the City Council passed ordinance No. 181, which approved of Rodd's plans for the creation of Roslyn Place.Official Pittsburgh, No. 181, The Pittsburgh Daily Post. May 30, 1914. In the same year the City Council passed ordinance No. 240, which authorized the purchase of a water pipe line connecting to Roslyn Place.No. 240, Pittsburgh Daily Post, July 13, 1914. This is representative of the progress and modernization that occurred with the new development. The construction continued for the next two years and finished in 1917, and the advertisements of the new development were published.Lots, Pittsburgh Post- Gazette, August 30, 1913. The houses in the constructed neighborhood served as mainly rental properties owned by the Rodd family until the 1950s when the individual homes were sold. The houses continue to serve residential functions and the Roslyn Place neighborhood was nominated in October 2017 to become a City Historic District by Preservation Pittsburgh.  Architecture  The district was designed by Thomas Rodd in the Colonial Revival architectural style, with significant Georgian Revival influences. Examples of the Colonial Revival style are rare within the City of Pittsburgh. The scale, uniformity, and quality of design are what make Roslyn Place's Colonial Revival elements exceptional.Colonial Revival Style 1880-1960, Pennsylvania Historical & Museum Commission, Accessed on September 16, 2017. Roslyn Place also has significant Georgian Revival elements, and these can be seen with the symmetrical facades, the hemispherical hoods, the pediment porches, the use of brick, and the coffered design elements on the porches and hoods. The street Roslyn Place is also notable as an example of Nicolson pavement. The neighborhood's design and planning approach is widely recognized, most notably by acclaimed urban planner Allan Jacobs.

Sch√ºz was born in Markgr√∂ningen where his namesake father was a pastor. His mother was Elise Weitbrecht. After schooling at the Charles Gymnasium in Stuttgart, he went on to study at the University of T√ºbingen. He went on to study at the University of Berlin under Erwin Stresemann, receiving a doctorate in 1927. His research was on powder down feathers. He worked at the natural history museums at Hanover and Dresden and worked at the Rossitten bird observatory from 1929 under Oskar Heinroth. From 1936 he headed the Rossitten observatory and organized coordinated ringing studies on white storks and grey herons. He also conducted experiments on migration, orientation, and physiology in starlings along with Werner R√ºppell and Paul Putzig. In 1943 he was drafted into the war. After the war he established the Radolfzell ornithological observatory along with Nikolaus von Bodman. Sch√ºz helped integrate the observatory into the Max Planck Society. in 1959. From 1959 he served as director of the State Museum of Natural History at Stuttgart. He was an honorary professor at the University of Stuttgart. Sch√ºz's early work was on migration and he published an atlas of bird migration in 1931 along with Hugo Weigold. In 1942 he was asked to evaluate a proposal (Storchbein Propaganda or \\"stork-leg propaganda\\") by Heinrich Himmler to use storks reared in Rossiten for German war propaganda. They were to carry propaganda to be delivered to the Boers in South Africa. Sch√ºz pointed out that the recovery rate was less than 1% which meant that more than a 1000 storks would be needed to deliver about 10 leaflets which led the idea to be shelved. He later worked on demographics, physiology, and conservation. One of Sch√ºz's important experimental studies was on white storks. Sch√ºz's predecessor and founder of the Rossiten observatory, Thienemann, had found that birds that bred in eastern Prussia migrated southeast while those to the west migrated to the southwest. Sch√ºz took young storks from the eastern part of this migratory divide and moved them to the western side and found that they took a southwesterly route and apparently followed the adults. He however conducted another experiment where the young were released only after all the adults had migrated and found that the eastern storks raised in the west chose an apparently innate southeasterly route. He married Tabitha Brenner in 1926 who died in 1941 shortly after the birth of their son. He married Hanna Steinheil in 1944.

It began on May 27, 1856 and ended on May 28, 1856. The battle was fought along the Rogue River, eight miles upriver from Agness, Oregon. \\"The battle was fought between one reinforced Army company; Company \\"C\\", 1st Dragoons, and a large group of Indians from many different bands. Captain Andrew Jackson Smith was the commanding officer of Company \\"C\\" during the battle, and Chief John, a member of the Dakubetede Indian band, lead all the warriors.\\" Under Smith's Command were 66 enlisted men from Company \\"C\\" of the 1st Cavalry Regiment, 30 enlisted men from Company \\"E\\" of the 4th Infantry Regiment, and 54 enlisted men from Company \\"G\\" of the 4th Infantry Regiment. The orders of the G Company were to accompany Smith's forces to Big Bend and then return to Oak Flat on the Illinois River.  Battle  On the morning of the 27th, several Natives came to Smith's camp at Big Bend and alerted them that more Natives were on the way. Later that morning, a group of armed Natives formed outside the camp. Upon realizing that much of the growing group were followers of Chief John, Smith placed his entire command under arms. The first shots of the battle were fired at around 11:00am by the Natives. The attackers led a consistent assault throughout the day on Smith's position on the high ground. By the night of the 27th, US troops had suffered four killed and 15 wounded. At about 4:00am the next morning, the firing resumed when Natives noticed US troop movements as they attempted to improve their defensive positions. Shooting continued for the next 12 hours. at 4:00pm, Captain Augur's forces from Company \\"G\\" arrived at the battle and attacked Native positions, pushing them back. Smith then commanded Sweitzer's forces from Company \\"E\\" to assault Native positions as well. On the night of the 28th, Natives began to surrender to the US Army. By the 30th of May, 185 Natives had surrendered at Big Bend.  Aftermath  The Battle of Big Bend left a total of 10 US troops dead and 17 wounded. Seven of the deaths were from Company \\"C\\", one from Company \\"E\\", and two from Company \\"G\\". Of the 17 wounded, 9 came from Company \\"C\\", 5 from Company \\"E\\", and 3 from Company \\"G\\".

She moves to London with Mercy from her hometown Kattappana. Mercy is a doctor who lives with her husband Dr. Mukundanunni (Shyamaprasad) and her two children. Two weeks after Rosamma comes to London, she dies in sleep. Mercy informs her siblings Ammini, the eldest, a nurse who lives in Canada with her husband Anto (Johny Antony) and her kids; businessman Philip who lives in America with his family; businessman Benny who lives in Australia with his family; and Jomon who lives and is looking for a job in Dubai. Philip tells Mukundan than they can share the expense of the funeral. Ammini requests Mercy not to take the body to the mortuary. Mukundan's mother also tells him the body should not be kept in the home for too many days. Mukundan contacts a funeral agency run by Dixon Lopez (Dileesh Pothan) partnered with Rajagopal (Mohanlal). Mukundan requests that they find another home or place to keep the body. Eventually, they rent a house for 10 days and takes the body there. When Mercy's siblings arrive, Dixon and Raju explains their matters and rate. Mukundan agrees to pay the advance and is ready to sign the agreement. The youngest Jomon opposes their decision. He says their mother's last wish was that the funeral must take place in Kattappana beside their late father John Cacko (Thilakan). His siblings except Mercy to oppose his request. An angered Jomon leaves the place and resides in a lodge. Raju reaches the house where the body is kept. Their worker Podiyan (Baiju Santhosh) leaves for an emergency. He drinks vodka and hallucinates that Rosamma is talking to him. She asks him about his family. Raju tells her that his wife Rekha (Asha Sarath) shut him out of their house because she found out he was sex talking with her friend. Rosamma tells Raju about her last wish to be buried in Kattappana and asks him to help Jomon make the wish fulfilled and to think of her as his mother, and then all his problems will be solved by God. Raju decides to help Jomon, but all his efforts were wasted. At last, he gets a call from Kunjachayan (Renji Panicker), his friend and a political leader, who agrees to help him. He contacts assistant engineer Balachandran (Jayaraj Warrier) at Kottayam Municipality. Balachandran makes a surprise inspection at the shopping complex that is being constructed by Philip and Benny and gives a stop memo. Philip and Benny are informed of this news by their contractor and told that they should appear before the chairman within two days. Philip and Benny contact Dixon and inform him that they decided to bury their mother in Kattappana. Dixon then demands the balance amount and they can take the body. They eventually agree to bury the body in London in the morning and leave to Kottayam an afternoon flight. In the meantime, Raju and Jomon forcefully take the body from the rented house to Raju and Rekha's house. Eventually, Rekha understands Raju and forgives him. A flustered Dixon informs the family that the funeral will not happen before 4 PM on the determined day. Philip and Benny decide to leave without attending the funeral. After they leave, Jomon comes and tells the rest that he and Raju did all of this to make their mother's last wish to come true. He invites Mercy and Mukundan to accompany him. He says that Rosamma has given the house in his name and rips up the document in front of them. He said he is ready to give the house to Ammini if she wants to come. Ammini tearfully agrees to accompany him and they bury Rosamma's body besides their father's catacomb. Raju and Rekha also visit the catacomb. Later, Kunjachayan informs Raju that they lied to Balachandran, but there are real problems in the building's construction.

Father Lampert was appointed to become an exorcist by Archbishop Daniel M. Buechlien. He is one of the few exorcists known to use social media like Twitter ( @FrVinceLampert ) on a regular basis. In one article he told the reporter that he is fighting the devil by tweeting about exorcism.  Life and work  Father Vince Lampert is assigned as the Pastor of St. Peter & St. Michael the Archangel Catholic Churches in Brookville, Indiana. Father Vince was born on April 7, 1963. He grew up in a large Roman Catholic family that was active in the faith on the west side of Indianapolis, Indiana. His favorite quote is also known as the Jesus Prayer, \\"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\\" In 1981 he graduated from Cardinal Ritter High School. For a couple of years he studied political sciences at Indiana University - Bloomington, before transferring to the Saint Meinrad Seminary to study for the priesthood. Father Vince received his Master of Divinity degree from the Benedictine monks who own and operate Saint Meinrad Archabbey.  Exorcism  Father Vince Lampert received his exorcism classroom training at the Pontifical North American College in Rome,Italy. He was in the same training class with Father Gary Thomas, the exorcist for San Jose, California US. Matt Baglio wrote the book, The Rite: The Making of a Modern Exorcist based on Father Gary Thomas, that later became the 2011 movie, The Rite. Father Lampert received practical experience, by assisting on over 40 exorcisms with Father Carmine de Filippis, who is the mentor for exorcists in the Diocese of Rome. While speaking to students about exorcism at Seton Hall University about his training, he told them he spent three months training to be an exorcist. At the invitation of the Newman Center of Montclair State, Father Lampert gave a talk to the students. He told them about how he went to a local ice cream shop to celebrate, after a year long series of prayers over a person, that finally released the person from their demonic situation. During a 2016 talk with students at Purdue University, Father Vince Lampert identified various occult practices that could lead a person to be tied to evil. The presence of an evil spirit include bodily contortions, changes in the person's voice, unpleasant odors, and temperature changes in a room. Father Vince Lampert consulted on a famous case, as the designated exorcist of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis. Father Michael Maginot, pastor of St. Stephen Martyr Church in Merrillville, Indiana had permission from his Bishop Dale Joseph Melczek to work with Father Vince on a house then owned by Zak Bagans. After various prayers and blessings, including the use of holy water, the house was demolished in 2016. As a noted expert on exorcism, who is willing to be published in the media about his work, Father Lampert has spoken about the difference between exorcisms that are authorized by the local bishop, compared to fee-based \\"private exorcists\\" that work independent of the church. Lampert has met with other exorcists in Rome during meetings with the International Association of Exorcists. When he was appointed as an exorcist in 2005, there were perhaps only 12 exorcists in the US. Today, there are more than 50 that he knows personally in the USA. As one of the noted authorities on exorcism, he was interviewed in documentary movie The Rite of Exorcism: Myth, Mystery & Hope along with other noted exorcists like Fr. Gabriele Amorth and Fr. Jos√© Antonio Fortea. His first exorcism case as documented in an episode during the 2013 season of the cable television network Syfy series Paranormal Witness. When the Fox TV Show The Exorcist was released a Fox TV News crew did a two minute interview with the exorcist that is sought out for interviews from around the world for his commentary on the series. Father Lambert was quoted in an article by The Atlantic that as of October 2018 he had received 1,700 phone or email requests for exorcisms, the most he had ever in a year. Father Lampert once said that exorcisms were on the rise due to a wavering faith in the Church and factors like drug abuse. As his case load increased, a center to provide training for exorcist priests and deacons was set up in the United States to teach courses to clergy only. The Pope Leo XIII Institute was founded in Milwaukee in 2012 to assist in training for exorcists.

Although he had also been thinking about it, Kang-soo believes stealing the money will not change anything and will even make Tae-bok very furious. Kang-soo drives away with a drunk Sun-young and crashes into an oncoming truck. Kang-soo's father learns of the accident and rushes to the hospital, mourning at the doors of the operating room. Kang-soo wakes up in the hospital, and realizes that Sun- young has been discharged. Tae-bok gets suspicious of Kang-soo and asks him why Sun-young ended up with him on the night of the accident. Kang-soo decides to return to Bliss Laboratory, but Dr. Woo tells him that, not like before, he has to pay a ‚Ç©300,000,000 participation fee due to a rapid increase of participants. The next day, Kang-soo attempts to unlock Tae-bok's safe but he gets caught by Tae-bok. Kang-soo is about to get beaten up by Tae-bok's henchmen when the police arrive to raid the business. As Tae-bok and his men are arrested, Kang-soo sees his co-worker Hong Ki-chul (Kim Kyung-nam) come out of hiding. Suspecting the police stakeout was part of Ki-chul's plan to steal the money, Kang-soo takes all the money in the safe and escapes. He was about to pay his participation fee but upon arriving at Bliss Laboratory's address, the building is already gone. Later, Jung-man reveals to Kang-soo his regrets and that he already had the address where In-sook could recently be living. The father and son reconciles. Kang-soo receives a call from Ki-chul, telling him that Tae-bok will soon be released due to lack of evidence and requests for them to meet. When he arrives at their supposed meeting place, Kang-soo realizes that Ki-chul had fooled him. He rushes back to his house but finds the money gone; Ki-chul was nowhere to be found. After days of looking for Ki-chul, he watches the news on TV and founds out that Tae-bok has escaped from prison. He is captured by Tae-bok and his henchmen, but as he was about to be buried alive he tells that Ki-chul had stolen the money, just as Ki-chul arrives. Ki-chul hands the bag of money to Tae-bok, but Kang-soo snatches it and runs away, chased by Tae-bok and his men. The police arrive and runs after Tae-bok, but as Kang-soo whispers his wish for Tae-bok to die, a vehicle suddenly drives into the street and runs into Tae-bok, instantly killing him. Kang-soo becomes very happy and contented over his newfound wealth, and he becomes Sun-young's fianc√©. But it is revealed that the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Kang-soo is lying in a sleep-like state in a room in Bliss Laboratory with tubes injecting a blue fluid‚Äîthe ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù capsule dissolved in liquid‚Äîinto his head. Dr. Woo is observing Kang-soo through a window separating Kang-soo and the control room. The scenes starting from Kang-soo waking up in the hospital and onwards were all part of the simulated reality induced by Dr. Woo's capsule. Kang- soo's father is seen in front of Bliss Laboratory's building holding a bracelet with a string of five digits inscribed on it. He sees a seemingly dead body covered in a blanket being brought from the building into a Bliss Laboratory truck. He follows a truck and arrives in an unknown building, where he saw the body being brought into a room. He peeks through the door's window and sees that the dead body, now enclosed in large flames, wore a bracelet like the one he is holding to. With horror, he realizes that he is witnessing one of Bliss Laboratory's dead subjects being burned in a crematorium. Episodes 3‚Äì4 The scene goes back to the night of Kang-soo and Sun- young's vehicular accident. Due to severe brain injury, Kang-soo may not live a normal life anymore if he happens to survive. Dr. Woo arrives at the hospital and talks to the grief-stricken Do Jung-man on Kang-soo's chance to be happy. At Bliss Laboratory, Dr. Woo convinces Jung-man to let Kang-soo undergo the experiment, in return for a reward money to be granted to him. With Dr. Woo's assurance and Tae-bok's warning, Jung-man concedes with the testing. Outside Bliss Laboratory, Jung-man sees a presumably dead body being carried out of the building into a truck. He picks up a bracelet that had fallen from the body. The bracelet have a string of five digits inscribed on it. Meanwhile, Dr. Woo and her team lays Kang-soo on a bed, with small tubes connecting his head to a fluid-filled cylinder. Upon Dr. Woo's signal, the test starts: a ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù capsule is dissolved in the cylinder, and the resulting fluid is injected into Kang-woo. The simulated reality (which was revealed in Episodes 1 to 2) starts in Kang-soo's consciousness. Jung-man returns with the bracelet to Bliss Laboratory and sees another body carried into a truck. He follows the truck, and ends up in a crematorium. He realizes that Bliss Laboratory's subjects can actually die from the experiment. Back to the capsule-induced alternate reality, Kang-soo becomes the CEO of his own company and he is ready to be married to Sun-young. At home, Sun-young asks Kang-soo's father if they have any photos of Kang-soo when he was still young. Keeping his painful past a secret, Kang-soo tells her that his father is too busy to take family pictures, but to his surprise, his father took out a photo album filled with many pictures showing him and his father. Kang-soo also manages to find his mother, who is owning a business by the sea. His mother recognizes him and apologizes for leaving him behind when he was still young. Meanwhile, in the real world, Jung-man pleads Dr. Woo to let Kang-soo go. He reveals his discovery of the dead subjects, showing her the fallen bracelet. Dr. Woo insists to Jung-man that there is only a 0.1% chance that Kang-soo will perish in the experiment, and if he did die, he would die as a happy person. To Jung-man's shock, he learns from Dr. Woo about Kang-soo visiting the laboratory after reading the message from one of their flyers and declining the offer for Jung-man's sake. Dr. Woo reveals to him that only by the subject's own willpower can the subject force himself out of the simulation. If one is not able to exit, his or her physical activities will eventually stop. And considering the happiness one can experience in the simulation, it may already be too hard for one to exit from the simulation. Devastated, Jung-man asks Dr. Woo to let him see Kang-soo for the last time. In the simulated reality, Kang-soo's parents are finally reunited. Kang-soo receives a mysterious call telling him to ‚Äúget out‚Äù immediately. He dismisses the call and spends happy times with his parents and Sun-young, taking photos at the seashore. Back at his company, he chases a suspicious hooded man but he loses him, and he suddenly experiences a spell of dizziness. Later, he notices that the scar on his right elbow, which he got when he was still young from one of his father's tantrums, was already gone. Kang-soo starts to feel suspicious. In the real world, the diluted capsule is actually getting used up. Dr. Woo orders to increase the dosage for the test to continue. In response to the increased dosage, Kang-soo wakes up and finds himself in a new high-rise corporate building. Kang-soo asks Sun-young about the building, and he learns that he had signed a contract and had taken over a larger company as its new CEO. Kang-soo's fears and suspicious grow when, upon asking Sun-young about her dream, she tells him she dreams of owning a building (instead of being an actress). To test her, Kang-soo breaks up with Sun-young and asks her a few seconds later if they could start over again. He expects Sun-young to reject him, but to his surprise, Sun-young easily agreed for them to start over. Disappointed, Kang-soo gets drunk and falls down. Though he is very dizzy, he saw the hooded man approach him and telling the same warning, to ‚Äúget out.‚Äù He wakes up and finds himself back at home in his bedroom with his mother. Upon asking her if she is okay reuniting with his father, she tells him that she had forgiven his father and that, no matter what, Kang-soo will be the most precious to her. His suspicions dominating, Kang-soo then recalls how her mother quickly recognized him, considering that they have never met each other for the past 30 years. Kang-soo becomes dizzy again, with the image of the hooded man and his warning coming back to his mind. To rid Kang-soo of his suspicions and make him think of going back to the simulation, Dr. Woo temporarily inhibits the flow of the medicine to his brain. This, she believes, will let him experience reality and let him see ‚Äúwhat a nightmare his real life has been.‚Äù In consequence, Kang-soo's mother escapes from home, his father becomes a fourth-stage liver cancer patient, Tae-bok is suddenly resurrected and tries to catch him with his henchmen, and Sun-young changes sides and goes back to Tae-bok. Kang-soo hides in hotel room and mourns over his loss; now, he wishes not to go back to his miserable past. In the real world, Dr. Woo then returns his dosage of the medicine, and the simulation shifts back to normal. Kang-soo meets the hooded man again, who tells him that there is not much time left and he will not last long the simulated reality. The hooded man pleads Kang-soo to ‚Äúget out‚Äù of the fake reality. Kang-soo unmasks the hooded man, who turns out to be the manifestation of his real father. In the real world, it was at this moment when his father visits him in his room and sobs beside him while holding his hand. He asks for forgiveness, tells him that he loves him, and pleads for him to wake up and look at reality. Back in the simulation, the hooded man disappears and Kang-soo gets dizzy again. He realizes that he is not happy at the fake reality that he is in and he wants to see his real father again. With resolve, he decides to exit from the simulation. Dr. Woo rushes to the control room to increase his dosage, but the Kang-soo in the simulation begins plunging himself into the sea. After three counts, he drowns himself into the water, and the Kang-soo in the real world finally wakes up from the simulation. Kang-soo, still injured from the accident, limps his way out of Bliss Laboratory. On the way, he sees other subjects still immersed in the simulation, including Sun-young. Before he opens the exit, Dr. Woo confronts him, but he dismisses her, simply telling her that his father likes to eat jokbal. Kang-soo arrives at home and finds his father staring longingly at his mother's photographs. Realizing that Kang- soo is already home, the father and son look at each other with tears of joy. In the closing scene of the series, a photo studio is shown with a photograph of Kang-soo and his father, encased in a frame, put up on display.

Guitarist Kurt Ballou stated that the band is positive about releasing the remaining four tracks at some point: \\"We all disagreed about what the strongest songs were, and which songs made for the best record. I think we're all equally unhappy with what ended up on the album. It was a compromise. Some of the songs on that album are actually some of the weakest ones that we recorded, and some of the ones that aren't on the album are the strongest. We're just not exactly sure how we're going to release them yet. Whether it's B-sides, or an EP, we don't know yet.\\"  Release and promotion  On June 28, 2018, the band uploaded a short series of images to their Instagram page, which together assemble the EP's cover art, with the EP's title being alluded to in the hashtags.

He became a professor of animal physiology at Potsdam and later became a professor at the Pedagogical Highschool in 1991. He took an interest in waterbirds and the conservation of their habitats establishing a waterbird research centre in East Germany in 1967 and conducting bird censuses. He conducted research on greylag geese and their migration. Rutschke helped make the German Democratic Republic a signatory to the Ramsar Convention on 31 July 1978.

The uprising was centered around the village of Vyoshenskaya.  The uprising  At the end of 1918 and beginning of 1919 the Tsaritsyn Front of the Don Army suffered a serious defeat against the Bolsheviks in the Voronezh‚ÄìPovorino Operation. The Don Army retreated south, but many Upper-Don Cossacks went home, hoping for some peace settlement with the Red Army. But the Red Army ordered the Cossacks to surrender all weapons within 24 hours under the threat of execution. They also decided to confiscate the property from the \\"rich and bourgeois\\" and any money except Soviet money was banned. The district was flooded with Red units passing south to the front, leading to requisitioning of bread, horses and ordinary robbery. The Red tribunals began to draw up execution lists. By the beginning of the uprising, up to 300 Cossacks had been shot, and rumors of executions lists of hundreds of Cossacks from every village, completely upset the Upper Don Cossacks. This led to a spontaneous uprising in the whole district, of which Pavel Kudinov became the leader. To suppress the uprising, the Red Army was forced to divert 14,000 soldiers from the 8th and 9th armies of the Southern Front. Despite the massive repression, the Don Cossacks managed, with the support of parts of the Don Army, to contain the onslaught of the expeditionary forces. The insurgents, whose strength was estimated at 30,000, tied down roughly the same number of Soviet troops, diverting them from checking the advance of the Don Army. Between May 28-June 2, the Don Army command took to the offensive along the entire front. Having seized the initiative, the units of the Don Army occupied Millerovo in May, Lugansk on June 1 and, interacting with units of the Volunteer Army, drove the 8th Red Army to the north in the direction of Voronezh, and the 9th Red Army to the northeast in the direction of Balashov. The insurgents united with the Don Army at Vyoshenskaya and by the end of June the Don Host Oblast had been cleared of Soviet forces.

On the right, another humanoid cartoon character with pointy ears whose body has pink checkers is wearing a pink-checkered cape and also pumping its fist. Miraitowa () is the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics, and Someity () is the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Paralympics. Both events are scheduled to be held in Tokyo, Japan, in 2021. The checkered design on both mascots was inspired by the Tokyo 2020 official logo, while Someity's pink design was inspired by cherry blossoms. Both fictional characters have various superpowers, such as teleportation. Created by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, the mascots were selected from a competition process which took place in late 2017 and early 2018. A total of 2,042 candidate designs were submitted to the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee, which then selected three pairs of unnamed mascot designs from the batch to present to Japanese elementary school students for the final decision. The results of the selection were announced on 28 February 2018, and the mascots were named on 22 July 2018. Miraitowa is named after the Japanese words for and , and Someity is named after someiyoshino, a type of cherry blossom. Someity's name also echoes the English phrase \\"so mighty\\". The mascots are expected to help finance the Tokyo Games through merchandising and licensing deals.  History   Selection and naming process  In late 2017 and early 2018, the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee held a competition to determine the design of the 2020 mascots. A total of 2,042 design submissions were accepted between 1 August and 14 August 2017. The entries were then subjected to a series of format and design examinations led by media specialists and the Organising Committee's Mascot Selection Panel to determine whether they \\"would appeal to elementary school-aged children\\" and whether they \\"amply reflected the spirit of the Tokyo 2020 Games Vision\\". By mid-October 2017, this process reduced the pool to a shortlist of three sets of mascot candidates, which were unveiled on 7 December 2017. Each set included two mascots: one for the Olympic Games and the other for the Paralympic Games. Between 11 December 2017 and 22 February 2018, an election was conducted across 16,769 Japanese elementary schools to choose the winning entry, with each participating elementary school class allocated one vote. In total, 205,755 elementary school classes participated in the election, which was about 75% of elementary schools in Japan. {  +Results of the mascot selection !Pair !Designer !Votes received !Profile - A (winner) Ryo Taniguchi () 109,041  - B Kana Yano () 61,423  - C Sanae Akimoto () 35,291  } The chosen mascots were announced without names on 28 February 2018. The winning entry was candidate pair A, created by Ryo Taniguchi. The Mascot Selection Panel held a vote on a shortlist of proposed names on 28 May 2018, and names with the most votes were subjected to a trademark verification process before they became official. The names of the mascots, Miraitowa and Someity, were announced when the mascots made their formal debut at a press event on 22 July 2018.  Characteristics  Miraitowa, the Olympic mascot, is a figure with blue-checkered patterns inspired by the Games' official logo. It is intended to embody \\"both old tradition and new innovation\\". The character has a \\"strong sense of justice\\" and is described as \\"very athletic\\". It has the ability to teleport anywhere instantly.

The character is described as \\"usually calm\\" but can become \\"very powerful when needed\\". The character has the ability to fly using its checkered cape and to send telepathic messages using its cherry blossom-shaped antennae. It can also \\"talk to stones and the wind\\" and move objects by looking at them. Someity is named after someiyoshino, a type of cherry blossom, and it is also intended to refer to the English phrase \\"so mighty\\". Although the two mascots have conflicting personalities, they nonetheless have a strong friendship and respect for each other. According to their fictional backgrounds, Miraitowa and Someity \\"live in the digital world\\", and through the Internet, they can transport themselves between the digital world and the real world. According to Sadashige Aoki, an advertising theory professor at Hosei University, the mascots follow a Japanese tradition of \\"creating personalized characters out of nature ‚Äî mountains, rivers, animals and plants\\", as well as a \\"tradition of animism, a belief that every natural thing has a soul\\". The mascots were designed by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, who lives in the Fukuoka Prefecture in southern Japan. Taniguchi was persuaded by his father, who is also an illustrator, to study art at Cabrillo College in California. He has illustrated English-language textbooks for Japanese children. Taniguchi was uninvolved in the naming of the mascots, though he did attend a screening at which various naming proposals were introduced. As part of the agreement to use the mascots, Taniguchi transferred intellectual property rights to the mascots to the Olympic and Paralympic committees, and as a result, he will not receive any royalty payments from mascot-related licensing.  Media   Merchandising  Official merchandising for Tokyo 2020, some of which include Miraitowa and Someity The mascots are expected to generate revenue to help finance the Tokyo Games. An Olympic official expected the mascots to generate $130 million () in revenue from licensing and merchandising. The organizers of Tokyo 2020 had been criticized for its budget management. According to Reuters, a 2016 study found that overall expenses for the Olympics could be \\"four times the initial estimate made in the bid process\\". Tokyo 2020 must transfer intellectual property rights to the mascots to the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee after the Games are concluded, which would prevent Tokyo from licensing and developing the mascots after the Games are over. From late July to early September 2018, a \\"Mascot House\\" was located on the first floor of the Tokyo Midtown Hibiya building, where visitors could take photos with the mascots and purchase licensed merchandise featuring the mascots. On 11 July 2019, the Tokyo 2020 organizers unveiled new merchandise, some of it featuring the mascots. merchandise can be purchased either online or through authorized vendors throughout Japan. Plush dolls of Miraitowa and Someity will be attached to the bouquets given to Olympic and Paralympic medalists at Tokyo 2020 as part of their design by the Nippon Flower Council.  Robotics  On 22 July 2019, the organizers of the 2020 Summer Olympics announced that robotic automatons of Miraitowa and Someity, among other robots, are expected to be included during the Games. According to the Los Angeles Times, the robots are \\"programmed to show facial expressions as they wave at and shake hands with athletes and fans\\". The Tokyo 2020 organizing committee plans to use the mascots primarily to promote the Games and greet visitors and athletes, attempting to increase engagement with children. The robots were also featured as part of a \\"1 Year to Go\\" press event on 22 July 2019 at an Olympic venue in Tokyo. The robots were included as part of another press event on 18 November 2019 at a Japanese elementary school. The robots' eyes can change to display hearts, along with other emotions, and their multiple joints and arms can be remotely controlled. Cameras allow the robots to recognize and respond to facial expressions. The robots were developed in collaboration with Toyota.  Animation  On 22 July 2019, the official Japanese Twitter account of Tokyo 2020 posted an animated short depicting Miraitowa participating in all the sports to be contested at the Games. On 25 August 2019, the same Twitter account posted a similar animated video featuring Someity participating in the Paralympic Games.  Reception  Miraitowa and Someity on a Toei Bus in Tokyo The public reaction to the mascot selection was \\"generally positive\\", according to an article published on Forbes' website in March 2018 by contributor Jake Adelstein. Adelstein described the mascots as \\"cute\\", though he commented that \\"there was some criticism of the futuristic blue and pink characters falling clearly into traditional gender roles\\". Adelstein speculated that the mascots would support the Olympics in Tokyo financially. Multiple observers compared the design of the mascots to that of the Pok√©mon and Digimon franchises. An article by Agence France-Presse described the social media reaction to the mascot selection on as \\"mixed\\". Some users commented that the mascots were \\"very Japanese and very cute\\", while others commented that the mascots should have been \\"more round\\" or \\"more huggable\\". Other commentators said that the selected design \\"appealed more to children whereas adults preferred the softer and more traditional options\\". Dan McQuade wrote in an article in sports news website Deadspin that it will be difficult for Miraitowa and Someity to match the popularity of Soohorang and Bandabi, the mascots of the 2018 Winter Olympics, citing statements from the BBC, which wrote that the 2020 mascots \\"have a tough act to follow\\", and The Japan Times, which wrote in a headline that the success of Soohorang and Bandabi \\"leaves Japan in a bind\\". James Dator, in a blog entry published on the sports news website SB Nation, wrote that there is \\"nothing functionally wrong\\" with the mascot design, but felt that Sanae Akimoto's pair C was a superior candidate and should have been chosen instead. Dator also argued that children should not have been the ones to make the final decision. On the other hand, Naoki Ogi, a Japanese pedagogy expert, emphasized the importance of the role of children in selecting the mascots, as opposed to adults. Japanese author Rurika Suzuki said that the mascots have a \\"a very Japanese anime-like quality\\", describing them as \\"brilliant and sporty and perfect for the Olympics\\".

The purpose of the attack was to free imprisoned members of the Polish underground, capture weapons and provisions from the Germans, capture and punish Nazi- collaborators, pre-empt a German conscription of local men for forced labor in Nazi Germany, and to demonstrate the significance of the Polish underground in the region. The Polish units suffered four casualties (two killed, two wounded) while killing approximately 150 German soldiers and policemen. Between 100 and 200 Belorussian auxiliary policemen deserted during the attack, switched side to the Poles and ended up joining the Polish partisans. While the attacks was a success (although some of the collaborators sought by the partisans managed to escape), it invited severe reprisals from the Germans. Around 150 civilians were murdered in reprisals for the uprising. In July 1943 the Germans launched the major anti-partisan Operation Hermann against all the partisan units (Polish as well as Soviet) in the nearby Naliboki Forest, during which civilian communities were destroyed, the fit deported as slave labor and the unfit murdered by the Germans.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Coonamble railway line was completed to Coonamble in 1903. The original station was burnt to the ground in a May 1910 fire. The station was subsequently rebuilt, and the current station buildings date from this time. In 2007, media reports suggested that the station was at risk of being demolished after the Australian Rail Track Corporation expressed concern about frequent vandalism causing maintenance and safety issues. The Coonamble Shire Council were looking for a possible tenant at that time to secure the building's future. The station received $131,045 in federal government heritage funding for protection and conservation works in 2009. The station platform had been recently reconstructed in 2015.  Description  The heritage-listed complex consists of a brick station building in a type 16 pioneer design with an awning, dating from 1910. The original heritage listing also included a timber goods shed, also from 1910, but it has subsequently been reported that it is no longer extant.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Coonamble is a site of high significance as a pioneer site with a brick building in \\"as built\\" form. It appears to be the only such example in the State, the other brick building of the same type being Narrabri which has been altered. The intactness of the station group is also of significance. The building is an important civic building, well detailed and proportioned and has the unusual use of rough cast on the gables with non standard timber detailing. The associated buildings add to the completeness of the site giving context to the station building. Coonamble railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

Gaos, 586 U.S. ___ (2019), was a per curiam decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in a case concerning the practice of cy pres settlements in class action lawsuits. Following oral argument, the court asked the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing whether the parties had Article III standing to pursue the case in federal courts. Supplemental briefing was completed on December 21, 2018. On March 20, 2019, the court remanded the case to the Ninth Circuit to address the plaintiffs‚Äô standing in light of Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins., 139 S. Ct. 1041 (2019) (citing , 136 S. Ct. 1540 (2016)). Background and lower court decisions In 2010, several individuals, including lead plaintiff Paloma Gaos, brought a class action against Google for allegedly leaking, in violation of privacy laws, information about their search terms to third parties by including search terms in the referrer header. After four days of negotiations, both sides agreed to a settlement, which requires approval by the presiding judge in the case to determine whether, per Rule 23(e)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, it is \\"fair, reasonable, and adequate\\". In exchange for settlement funds, all class members, even if they were unaware of the settlement, relinquish their claim against the defendant. Under the proposed settlement terms, the three lawyers in the case would receive over $2 million (an hourly rate of $1000/hour) and the named plaintiffs would receive $5,000 apiece, while an additional $6 million would be given to several privacy groups under the cy-pr√®s doctrine in lieu of compensation to then remaining unnamed class action members, due to the cost of administering the payout to those estimated 129 million individuals and the low amount of compensation (an estimated four cents). The privacy groups that would receive some of the money included each of the three lawyers' alma maters and several groups that Google has supported. The district court judge in the case, Judge Edward Davlia, noted \\"the elephant in the room is that many of them are law schools that you attended. ... I‚Äôm disappointed that the usual suspects are still usual.\\" Bloomberg News stated that Judge Davlia remarked that the lack of transparency in selecting the recipients of the money \\"raises a red flag\\" and \\"doesn‚Äôt pass the smell test\\", although it was nonetheless approved.See 5:10-cv-04809, Tr. of Proceedings on Aug. 23, 2013, Docket Item No. 57. In response to the settlement, Ted Frank and Melissa Holyoak of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, two of the 129 million unnamed members of the class being represented in the case, intervened to challenge the settlement on the grounds that it violated a procedural rule that such cy-pres settlements be \\"fair, reasonable and adequate.\\" Google labeled Frank as a \\"professional objector\\". The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the use of cy-pres in this case, noting that otherwise the estimated 129 million web users that could theoretically receive damages from the suit would receive \\"a paltry 4 cents in recovery.\\" As Brian Miller of the Center for Individual Rights, in an opinion piece for Forbes, summarized the problem: Supreme Court appeal Frank filed a petition of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court. The Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, Cato Institute, Center for Individual Rights, and Attorney General of Arizona, in a brief joined by 15 other states, filed amicus curiae briefs urging the court to grant certiorari. The court granted certiorari on April 30, 2018. The Court gives the following as the question presented in this case: The Solicitor General filed an amicus brief in support of neither party arguing that, before reaching the merits on the question presented, there is \\"considerable doubt whether the Court has Article III jurisdiction to address that question, because plaintiffs‚Äô standing in the district court depended on a theory of injury that this Court subsequently rejected in Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540 (2016)\\" and that the court may wish to vacate and remand the case to address the issue of standing.Brief for the United States as amicus curiae in support of neither party, p. 10., Frank v. Gaos, No. 17-961 (2018) Oral arguments were heard on October 31, 2018, with Frank having been one of the few Supreme Court attorneys ever to argue his own case.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/us/politics/theodore- frank-supreme-court.html The justices were divided along partisan lines based on observers' opinions, with the liberal justices supporting the cy pres approach used, while the conservative members felt the cy pres decision denied the class members their restitution and were critical of how much of the settlement went to legal fees. Writing for SCOTUSblog, Ronald Mann noted that at oral argument \\"all seemed to agree that the district court‚Äôs reasoning could not withstand scrutiny under Spokeo. The point of disagreement seemed to be whether there was any prospect that the plaintiffs could identify some new argument that would satisfy Spokeo at this late date.\\" The following week, the court ordered the parties and the Solicitor General \\"to file supplemental briefs addressing whether any named plaintiff has standing such that the federal courts have Article III jurisdiction over this dispute.\\" Briefing will be completed by December 21. The Court issued a per curiam decision on March 20, 2019, vacating the Ninth Circuit's decision and requesting continued review based on the Spokeo decision which had been brought up in the briefing stage of the case, in which questioned whether there was proper standing in this case. As the Spokeo question was not considered at the Ninth Circuit, the Supreme Court could not be the first court to consider that matter, and thus returned the case to lower courts, expressing no view on the matter otherwise.

It is primarily distributed in Sub-Saharan Africa. E-M2 is the predominant subclade in Western Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa and the African Great Lakes, and occurs at moderate frequencies in North Africa and Middle East. E-M2 has several subclades, but many of these subhaplogroups are included in either E-L485 or E-U175. E-M2 is especially common in native Africans speaking Niger- Congo languages and was spread to Southern and Eastern Africa through the Bantu expansion. Origins The discovery of two SNPs (V38 and V100) by Trombetta et al. (2011) significantly redefined the E-V38 phylogenetic tree. This led the authors to suggest that E-V38 may have originated in East Africa. E-V38 joins the West African-affiliated E-M2 and the northern East African- affiliated E-M329 with an earlier common ancestor who, like E-P2, may have also originated in East Africa. The downstreams SNP E-M180 possibly originated on the moist south-central Saharan savannah/grassland of northern Africa between 14,000‚Äì10,000 years BP. According to Wood et al. (2005) and Rosa et al. (2007), such population movements changed the pre-existing population Y chromosomal diversity in Central, Southern and southern East Africa, replacing the previous haplogroups frequencies in these areas with the now dominant E1b1a1 lineages. Traces of earlier inhabitants, however, can be observed today in these regions via the presence of the Y DNA haplogroups A1a, A1b, A2, A3, and B-M60 that are common in certain populations, such as the Mbuti and Khoisan. Distribution This haplogroup's frequency and diversity are highest in the West Africa region. Within Africa, E-M2 displays a west-to-east as well as a south-to-north clinal distribution. In other words, the frequency of the haplogroup decreases as one moves from western and southern Africa toward the eastern and northern parts of the continent. {  border=\\"1\\" style=\\"right\\" + Incidence of E-M2 !

Some of the lineages found in these areas are possibly due to the Bantu expansion or other migrations. The E-M2 marker that appeared in North African samples stem from Haratin (an ethnic group of black African origin indigenous to northwest Africa, related to but distinct from Sub-Saharan West Africans). However, the discovery in 2011 of the E-M2 marker that predates E-M2 has led Trombetta et al. to suggest that E-M2 may have originated in East Africa (please refer to the Origins section for details). In Eritrea and most of Ethiopia (excluding the Anuak) E-V38 is usually only found in the form of E-M329, which is autochthonous, while E-M2 generally indicates Bantu migratory origins.Plaster et al.

Rosa et al. (2007) E1b1a1 is defined by markers DYS271/M2/SY81, M291, P1/PN1, P189, P293, V43, and V95. Whilst E1b1a reaches its highest frequency of 81% in Senegal, only 1 of the 139 Senegalese that were tested showed M191/P86.[15] In other words, as one moves to West Africa from western Central Africa, the less subclade E1b1a1f is found. \\"A possible explanation might be that haplotype 24 chromosomes [E-M2*] were already present across the Sudanese belt when the M191 mutation, which defines haplotype 22, arose in central western Africa. Only then would a later demic expansion have brought haplotype 22 chromosomes from central western to western Africa, giving rise to the opposite clinal distributions of haplotypes 22 and 24.\\"[13] E1b1a1a1 E1b1a1a1 is commonly defined by M180/P88. The basal subclade is quite regularly observed in M2+ samples. E1b1a1a1a E1b1a1a1a is defined by marker M58. 5% (2/37) of the town Singa-Rima√Øb√©, Burkina Faso tested positive for E-M58. 15% (10/69) of Hutus in Rwanda tested positive for M58. Three South Africans tested positive for this marker. One Carioca from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil tested positive for the M58 SNP. The place of origin and age is unreported. E1b1a1a1b E1b1a1a1b is defined by M116.2, a private marker. A single carrier was found in Mali. The publication transposes M116.2 with M116.1 in Table 1. E1b1a1a1c E1b1a1a1c is defined by private marker M149. This marker was found in a single South African. E1b1a1a1d E1b1a1a1d is defined by a private marker M155. It is known from a single carrier in Mali. E1b1a1a1e E1b1a1a1e is defined by markers M10, M66, M156 and M195. Wairak people in Tanzania tested 4.6% (2/43) positive for E-M10. E-M10 was found in a single person of the Lissongo group in the Central African Republic and two members in a \\"Mixed\\" population from the Adamawa region. E1b1a1a1f E1b1a1a1f is defined by L485. The basal node E-L485* appears to be somewhat uncommon but has not been sufficiently tested in large populations. The ancestral L485 SNP (along with several of its subclades) was very recently discovered. Some of these SNPs have little or no published population data and/or have yet to receive nomenclature recognition by the YCC. *E1b1a1a1f1 is defined by marker L514. This SNP is currently without population study data outside of the 1000 Genomes Project. *E1b1a1a1f1a (YCC E1b1a7) is defined by marker M191/P86. Filippo et al. (2011) studied a number of African populations that were E-M2 positive and found the basal E-M191/P86 (without E-P252/U174) in a population of Gur speakers in Burkina Faso. Montano et al. (2011) found similar sparse distribution of E-M191* in Nigeria, Gabon, Cameroon and Congo. M191/P86 positive samples occurred in tested populations of Annang (38.3%), Ibibio (45.6%), Efik (45%), and Igbo (54.3%) living in Nigeria, West Africa. E-M191/P86 appears in varying frequencies in Central and Southern Africa but almost all are also positive for P252/U174. Bantu-speaking South Africans (89/343) tested 25.9% positive and Khoe-San speaking South Africans tested 7.7% (14/183) positive for this SNP. It also appears commonly in Africans living in the Americas. A population in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil tested 9.2% (12/130) positive. 34.9% (29/83) of American Haplogroup E men tested positive for M191. :Veeramah et al. (2010) studies of the recombining portions of M191 positive Y chromosomes suggest that this lineage has \\"diffusely spread with multiple high frequency haplotypes implying a longer evolutionary period since this haplogroup arose\\". The subclade E1b1a1a1f1a appears to express opposite clinal distributions to E1b1a1* in the West African Savanna region. Haplogroup E1b1a1a1f1a (E-M191) has a frequency of 23% in Cameroon (where it represents 42% of haplotypes carrying the DYS271 mutation or E-M2), 13% in Burkina Faso (16% of haplotypes carrying the M2/DYS271 mutation) and only 1% in Senegal. Similarly, while E1b1a reaches its highest frequency of 81% in Senegal, only 1 of the 139 Senegalese that were tested showed M191/P86. In other words, as one moves to West Africa from western Central Africa, the less subclade E1b1a1f is found. \\"A possible explanation might be that haplotype 24 chromosomes [E-M2*] were already present across the Sudanese belt when the M191 mutation, which defines haplotype 22, arose in central western Africa. Only then would a later demic expansion have brought haplotype 22 chromosomes from central western to western Africa, giving rise to the opposite clinal distributions of haplotypes 22 and 24.\\" *E1b1a1a1f1a1 (YCC E1b1a7a) is defined by P252/U174. It appears to be the most common subclade of E-L485. It is believed to have originated near western Central Africa. It is rarely found in the most western portions of West Africa. Montano et al. (2011) found this subclade very prevalent in Nigeria and Gabon. Filippo et al. (2011) estimated a tMRCA of ~4.2 kya from sample of Yoruba population positive for the SNP. *E1b1a1a1f1a1b (YCC E1b1a7a2) is defined by P115. This subclade has only been observed amongst Fang people of Central Africa. *E1b1a1a1f1a1c (YCC E1b1a7a3) is defined by P116. Montano et al. (2011) observed this SNP only in Gabon and a Bassa population from Cameroon. *E1b1a1a1f1a1d is defined by Z1704. This subclade has been observed across Africa. The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium found this SNP in Yoruba Nigerian, three Kenyan Luhyas and one African descent Puerto Rican. *E1b1a1a1f1b is defined by markers L515, L516, L517, and M263.2. This subclade was found by the researchers of Y-Chromosome Genome Comparison Project using data from the commercial bioinformatics company 23andMe. E1b1a1a1g E1b1a1a1g (YCC E1b1a8) is defined by marker U175. The basal E-U175* is extremely rare. Montano et al. (2011) only found one out of 505 tested African subjects who was U175 positive but negative for U209. Brucato et al. found similarly low frequencies of basal E-U175* in subjects in the Ivory Coast and Benin. Veeramah et al. (2010) found U175 in tested Annang (45.3%), Ibibio (37%), Efik (33.3%), and Igbo (25.3%) but did not test for U209. The supposed \\"Bantu haplotype\\" found in E-U175 carriers is \\"present at appreciable frequencies in other Niger‚ÄìCongo languages speaking peoples as far west as Guinea-Bissau\\". This is the modal haplotype of STR markers that is common in carriers of E-U175.The YCAII STR marker value of 19‚Äì19 is also usually indicative of U175. {  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"E-U175 haplotype  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"DYS19  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"DYS388  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"DYS390  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"DYS391  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"DYS392  align=\\"center\\" f0f0f0;\\"DYS393 -  151221101113 -  } E1b1a1a1g has several subclades. *E1b1a1a1g1 (YCC E1b1a8a) is defined by U209. It is the most prominent subclade of U175. This subclade has very high frequencies of over fifty percentages in Cameroonian populations of Bassa and Bakaka, possibly indicating place of origin. However, E-U209 is widely found at lower frequencies in West and Central African countries surrounding Cameroon and Gabon. Brucato et al. (2010) found the SNP in a populations of Ahizi (in Ivory Coast) 38.8% (19/49), Yacouba (Ivory Coast) 27.5% (11/40), and Beninese 6.5% (5/77) respectively. *E1b1a1a1g1a (YCC E1b1a8a1) is defined by U290. The Montano et al. (2011) study of U290 showed a lower frequency in Nigeria (11.7%) and western Central Africa than basal node U209. The highest population frequency rate in that study was 57.7% (15/26) in Ewondo in Cameroon. 32.5% (27/83) of American Haplogroup E men tested by Sims et al. (2007) were positive for this SNP. *E1b1a1a1g1a2 is defined by Z1725. This marker has been observed by The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium in Yoruba Nigerians and Luhya Kenyans. *E1b1a1a1g1c (YCC E1b1a4) is defined by M154. A Bamilike population tested 31.3% (15/48) for the marker. Bakaka speakers from Cameroon tested 8%. An Ovimbundu test population found this SNP at 14% (14/100). Members of this subclade have also been found in South Africa. *E1b1a1a1g1d is defined by V39. Trombetta et al. first published this SNP in 2011 but gave little population data about it. It is only known to have been found in an African population. E1b1a1a1h E1b1a1a1h is defined by markers P268 and P269. It was first reported in a person from the Gambia. Phylogenetics Phylogenetic history Prior to 2002, there were in academic literature at least seven naming systems for the Y-Chromosome Phylogenetic tree. This led to considerable confusion. In 2002, the major research groups came together and formed the Y-Chromosome Consortium (YCC). They published a joint paper that created a single new tree that all agreed to use. Later, a group of citizen scientists with an interest in population genetics and genetic genealogy formed a working group to create an amateur tree aiming at being above all timely. The table below brings together all of these works at the point of the landmark 2002 YCC Tree. This allows a researcher reviewing older published literature to quickly move between nomenclatures. {  ! align=\\"center\\" c63;\\"YCC 2002/2008 (Shorthand) ! align=\\"center\\" f96;\\"(Œ±) ! align=\\"center\\" f96;\\"(Œ≤) ! align=\\"center\\" f96;\\"(Œ≥)  align=\\"center\\" f96;\\"(Œ¥)  align=\\"center\\" f96;\\"(Œµ)  align=\\"center\\" f96;\\"(Œ∂)  align=\\"center\\" f96\\"(Œ∑)  align=\\"center\\" f96\\"YCC 2002 (Longhand)  align=\\"center\\" c96;\\"YCC 2005 (Longhand)  align=\\"center\\" c96;\\"YCC 2008 (Longhand)  align=\\"center\\" c96;\\"YCC 2010r (Longhand)  align=\\"center\\" ff9;\\"ISOGG 2006  align=\\"center\\" ff9;\\"ISOGG 2007  align=\\"center\\" ff9;\\"ISOGG 2008  align=\\"center\\" ff9;\\"ISOGG 2009  align=\\"center\\" ff9;\\"ISOGG 2010  align=\\"center\\" ff9;\\"ISOGG 2011  align=\\"center\\" ff9;\\"ISOGG 2012 -  E-P2921III3A13Eu3H2BE*EEEEEEEEEE -  E-M3321III3A13Eu3H2BE1*E1E1aE1aE1E1E1aE1aE1aE1aE1a -  E-M4421III3A13Eu3H2BE1aE1aE1a1E1a1E1aE1aE1a1E1a1E1a1E1a1E1a1 -  E-M7521III3A13Eu3H2BE2aE2E2E2E2E2E2E2E2E2E2 -  E-M5421III3A13Eu3H2BE2bE2bE2bE2b1------- -  E-P225III414Eu3H2BE3*E3E1bE1b1E3E3E1b1E1b1E1b1E1b1E1b1 -  E-M28III515Eu2H2BE3a*E3aE1b1E1b1aE3aE3aE1b1aE1b1aE1b1aE1b1a1E1b1a1 -  E-M588III515Eu2H2BE3a1E3a1E1b1a1E1b1a1E3a1E3a1E1b1a1E1b1a1E1b1a1E1b1a1a1aE1b1a1a1a -  E-M116.28III515Eu2H2BE3a2E3a2E1b1a2E1b1a2E3a2E3a2E1b1a2E1b1a2E1ba12removedremoved -  E-M1498III515Eu2H2BE3a3E3a3E1b1a3E1b1a3E3a3E3a3E1b1a3E1b1a3E1b1a3E1b1a1a1cE1b1a1a1c -  E-M1548III515Eu2H2BE3a4E3a4E1b1a4E1b1a4E3a4E3a4E1b1a4E1b1a4E1b1a4E1b1a1a1g1cE1b1a1a1g1c -  E-M1558III515Eu2H2BE3a5E3a5E1b1a5E1b1a5E3a5E3a5E1b1a5E1b1a5E1b1a5E1b1a1a1dE1b1a1a1d -  E-M108III515Eu2H2BE3a6E3a6E1b1a6E1b1a6E3a6E3a6E1b1a6E1b1a6E1b1a6E1b1a1a1eE1b1a1a1e -  E-M3525III414Eu4H2BE3b*E3bE1b1b1E1b1b1E3b1E3b1E1b1b1E1b1b1E1b1b1removedremoved -  E-M7825III414Eu4H2BE3b1*E3b1E1b1b1aE1b1b1a1E3b1aE3b1aE1b1b1aE1b1b1aE1b1b1aE1b1b1a1E1b1b1a1 -  E-M14825III414Eu4H2BE3b1aE3b1aE1b1b1a3aE1b1b1a1c1E3b1a3aE3b1a3aE1b1b1a3aE1b1b1a3aE1b1b1a3aE1b1b1a1c1E1b1b1a1c1 -  E-M8125III414Eu4H2BE3b2*E3b2E1b1b1bE1b1b1b1E3b1bE3b1bE1b1b1bE1b1b1bE1b1b1bE1b1b1b1E1b1b1b1a -  E-M10725III414Eu4H2BE3b2aE3b2aE1b1b1b1E1b1b1b1aE3b1b1E3b1b1E1b1b1b1E1b1b1b1E1b1b1b1E1b1b1b1aE1b1b1b1a1 -  E-M16525III414Eu4H2BE3b2bE3b2bE1b1b1b2E1b1b1b1b1E3b1b2E3b1b2E1b1b1b2aE1b1b1b2aE1b1b1b2aE1b1b1b2aE1b1b1b1a2a -  E-M12325III414Eu4H2BE3b3*E3b3E1b1b1cE1b1b1cE3b1cE3b1cE1b1b1cE1b1b1cE1b1b1cE1b1b1cE1b1b1b2a -  E-M3425III414Eu4H2BE3b3a*E3b3aE1b1b1c1E1b1b1c1E3b1c1E3b1c1E1b1b1c1E1b1b1c1E1b1b1c1E1b1b1c1E1b1b1b2a1 -  E-M13625III414Eu4H2BE3ba1E3b3a1E1b1b1c1aE1b1b1c1a1E3b1c1aE3b1c1aE1b1b1c1a1E1b1b1c1a1E1b1b1c1a1E1b1b1c1a1E1b1b1b2a1a1 - } =Research publications= The following research teams per their publications were represented in the creation of the YCC tree.

For any given real number \\\\theta and natural number h, it is easy to find the integer g such that g/h is closest to \\\\theta. For example, for the real number \\\\pi and h=100 we have g=314. If we call the closeness of \\\\theta to g/h the difference between h\\\\theta and g, the closeness is always less than 1/2 (in our example it is 0.15926...). A collection of numbers is a Heilbronn set if for any \\\\theta we can always find a sequence of values for h in the set where the closeness tends to zero. More mathematically let \\\\\\\\alpha\\\\ denote the distance from \\\\alpha to the nearest integer then \\\\mathcal H is a Heilbronn set if and only if for every real number \\\\theta and every \\\\varepsilon>0 there exists h\\\\in\\\\mathcal H such that \\\\h\\\\theta\\\\<\\\\varepsilon.  Examples  The natural numbers are a Heilbronn set as Dirichlet's approximation theorem shows that there exists q<[1/\\\\varepsilon] with \\\\q\\\\theta\\\\<\\\\varepsilon. The kth powers of integers are a Heilbronn set. This follows from a result of I. M. Vinogradov who showed that for every N and k there exists an exponent \\\\eta_k>0 and q such that \\\\q^k\\\\theta\\\\\\\\ll N^{-\\\\eta_k}. In the case k=2 Hans Heilbronn was able to show that \\\\eta_2 may be taken arbtrarily close to 1/2. Alexandru Zaharescu has improved Heilbronn's result to show that \\\\eta_2 may be taken arbitrarily close to 4/7. Any Van der Corput set is also a Heilbronn set.  Example of a non- Heilbronn set  The powers of 10 are not a Heilbronn set. Take \\\\varepsilon=0.001 then the statement that \\\\10^k\\\\theta\\\\<\\\\varepsilon for some k is equivalent to saying that the decimal expansion of \\\\theta has run of three zeros or three nines somewhere.

Hungary's family policy seeks to make childcare economically easier for new parents. History The Szab√≥ family, the most famous soap opera in Hungary during the second half of the 20th century. It was a typical depiction of a Hungarian family of that time. Hungary's population has been declining since 1980 - when the country's population peaked at 10.7 million - and with that it is the country in Europe which has been shrinking for the longest time. The main cause of that is that women on average do not have 2.1 or more babies to keep the population stable (see TFR). There were no governments that could change this declining trend since 1980, however, there were several visible alterations during the last decades.Hungarian Free Press - Hungarian action plan seeks to dramatically increase birth rate by 2030 - May 25, 2017 It fell from 2.17 in 1977 to 1.23 in 2011.

It was built on the site of a prison built in 1853 to house over 1,000 convicts, with the intention that they would be used to build the Dockyard extension. History During the Age of Sail, the Royal Navy manned its ships either by recruitment or impressment; crew were retained for as long as they were needed and then usually dismissed when their ship was paid off at the end of a voyage or campaign. The introduction of Long Term Service in 1853, however, prompted the Navy to look at providing more permanent quarters for seamen in home waters. At first, they were almost invariably housed in hulks; it was only towards the end of the century that purpose-built barracks began to be constructed at each of the three principal Royal Navy Dockyards: Chatham, Devonport and Portsmouth. These barracks were designed to provide not just accommodation but also recreation and training facilities for men who were waiting to be appointed to ships. Designed by Colonel Henry Pilkington, construction of the Royal Naval Barracks at Chatham began in 1897 and completed in December 1902.. By the beginning of the First World War, Chatham was one the Royal Navy‚Äôs three ‚Äòmanning ports‚Äô - together with Plymouth and Portsmouth - manned by men allocated to the Chatham Division. This role was to continue until the advent of central manning in 1956. In September 1917 the barracks Drill Hall (which was being used as overflow accommodation) suffered a direct hit from two bombs in September 1917, which killed over 130 men. In 1942, King George VI made a visit to Medway and HMS Pembroke, the Royal Naval Barracks at Chatham. After the war Chatham became home to the reserve, or standby fleet. In 1957, the barracks and gunnery school were closed due to the local port divisions being replaced; however in 1959 the barracks re-opened as the Royal Naval Supply School, who trained staff in supply and secretarial work. When the Commander-in-Chief, The Nore, the regional operational commander appointment, was discontinued in March 1961, the barracks were being used as an accommodation centre for the re-fitting crews of the dockyard. The Drill Shed and Canteen were being used by the Dockyard. In 1970, all Naval establishments in Chatham were to be combined together and known as HM Navy Base, under one officer 'Flag Officer, Medway and Port Admiral'. With the closure of the Dockyard and Naval Base in 1984 HMS Pembroke was also decommissioned; the barracks gates were finally closed on 31 March 1984.

It was found in the Tropidostoma Assemblage Zone (Tropidostoma) of the Main Karoo Basin of South Africa. It is a monotypic taxon which contains one only species, Leucocephalus wewersi. The genus name Leucocephalus is derived from Greek. Leucos, meaning white; kephalos, meaning skull, as the Leucocephalus skull discovered was unusually pale. Wewersi comes from the farm employee who found the skull, Klaus ‚ÄòKlaasie‚Äô Wewers.Michael O. Day; Roger M. H. Smith; Julien Benoit; Vincent Fernandez; Bruce S. Rubidge (2018). \\"A new species of burnetiid (Therapsida, Burnetiamorpha) from the early Wuchiapingian of South Africa and implications for the evolutionary ecology of the family Burnetiidae\\". Papers in Palaeontology. Online edition. . Biarmosuchians are a group of some of the earliest therapsids, a group of synapsids including mammalian ancestors.  Discovery  The skull of Leucocephalus was found in the Tropidostoma Assemblage Zone (Tropidostoma) of the Main Karoo Basin of South Africa. Only a single skull was found which was located in 2012 at a farm called Amandelboom in Northern Cape Province. It was found on a slope with strata that hosted a tetrapod fossil assemblage to the lower Tropidostoma AZ by a local sheep herder who then hung it on a fence on his farm. Although the skull was outside of its site of burial, strata stuck to it was verified to match that of the adjacent cliff section.  Paleoenvironment  The biostratigraphic occurrence of the skull was in the lowermost Tropidostoma Assemblage Zone. Based on previous dating of the surrounding strata, the Leucocephalus skull is estimated to be around 259 Ma. Other late permian therapsids have been collected from the same interval and vicinity including dicynodonts (Pristerodon mackay, Tropidostoma dubium, Diictodon feliceps), a gorgonopsian, and a pareiasaur. Based on discoveries of early therapsids and biarmosuchians, what is now southern Africa may have been the area of origin for burnetiamorphs. During the period Leucocephalus lived, what is considered the most extensive mass extinction in the history of the earth was occurring, which caused over 80% of the all Earth's species to go extinct. The cause of this end-Permian mass extinction is hypothesized to be climate change induced by volcanic CO2 degassing which lead to a cascade of biotic response.  Description and Paleobiology  Compared to their pelycosaur ancestors, Leucocephalus and other early therapsids are distinguished by more vertical (mammal like) leg positioning beneath their bodies, larger temporal fenestra and increased jaw complexity and power. Like other burnetiids, Leucocephalus skulls exhibit numerous distinguished bony protuberances and bosses giving it a bumpy appearance. These include paired supratemporal ‚Äò‚Äòhorns‚Äô‚Äô formed by the squamosals and parietals. In lateral view, a ridge like boss on the nasal extending exteriorly to the prefrontal is present.Rubidge, Bruce & Sidor, Christian. (2002). On the cranial morphology of the basal therapsids Burnetia and Proburnetia (Therapsida: Burnetiidae). Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. 22. 257-267. 10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0257:OTCMOT]2.0.CO;2. The snout is notably tall and the supraorbital region contains large triangular bosses. Amongst other members of the burnetiid family, Leucocephalus has some distinct features unique to its monophyletic genus. This includes a longer and rounder than usual vomerine process which is visible in palatal view. The maxilla comprises the majority of the snout and is also larger than usual. Leucocephalus also has a more random arrangement of polygonal raised surfaces and irregular trenches on maxilla than what is observed in other burnetiamorphs. This is hypothesized to be indicators of a thickened dermis or keratinized skin. Leucocephalus exhibits a sinuous intranarial process. Intranarial processes are common in mammal like therapsids, however they are usually straight in biarmosuchians.

In his early career, he wrote on xenograft hyperacute rejection and in December 1980 was part of the team that performed the first successful human heart transplant using the then newly discovered immunosuppressant cyclosporine. In 1981, he was part of Bruce Reitz's team that performed the world's first successful combined heart-lung transplant procedure at Stanford University. Following that, he continued to make significant contributions to heart-lung transplant procedures, and led programmes in cardiothoracic surgery in both adults and children. In 1986, he was elected president of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT), whilst he was professor and head of cardiothoracic surgery at the University of Minnesota. Later, he became dean of cardiovascular affairs and chair and distinguished professor of surgery at the University of California's (UCSD) department of surgery, where he co-founded the Sulpizio Cardiovascular Center.  Early life and education  Stuart Jamieson was born in 1947 and brought up in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). His childhood was spent on a 2.5 million acre ranch with pets that included a zebra, an ostrich and a giraffe. At the age of 18, Jamieson was sent to St Mary's Hospital, affiliated with the University of London, to study medicine. He financed his studies by working as a waiter.  Background  The first combined heart-lung transplant was accomplished by Denton Cooley in 1968, in Houston, in a two-year old girl with severe pulmonary hypertension. Despite surviving less than a day, her case showed that this kind of procedure could be effective. The second such transplant was performed in 1969, by C. Walton Lillehei at Cornell University Medical Center in New York City, in a 43-year- old man with emphysema. He lived for eight days. In 1971, South African Christiaan Barnard, also performed a combined heart-lung transplant in a 49-year-old man with emphysema, surviving for 23 days. The poor survival rates of these early transplantations, primarily resulted from inadequate immunosuppression and difficulties with joining the airways. In addition, Joel D. Cooper had found corticosteroids to weaken the bronchial anastomosis. It was on this background of tragic deaths that Jamieson later acknowledged and shared his research on xenograft hyperacute rejection. Early surgical career Following 1971's Life Magazine's media coverage of failed early heart transplantations, Jamieson published his first papers on xenograft hyperacute rejection in 1974 and 1975. In 1978, the American Heart Association awarded him a fellowship to study at Stanford University under the pioneering heart surgeon Norman Shumway, who had performed the first human heart transplant in America in 1967. Jamieson completed his residency in 1980 and stayed on as chief resident at Shumway's request. Later, he was listed in Clinical Cardiology (2000), as one of Norman Shumway's distinguished trainees. Before 1980, just under 40 lung transplantation procedures had been attempted, all of which resulted in the patient's death within a few months and just one resulted in the patient's discharge from hospital. In 1979 at Stanford, Jamieson performed 25 heart transplants, comprising more than 50 percent of the total performed globally at that time. In 1979, he described a series of successful transplantations in primates using cyclosporine, a fungal derivative whose immunosuppressive properties were reported by Jean-Francois Borel. Observing Roy Calne's reports on how cyclosporine led to a reduction in acute rejection and consequent longer survival rates following liver and kidney transplantation, Jamieson then demonstrated the possibility of using cyclosporine in human heart-lung transplantations. Subsequently, with Edward Stinson and Norman Shumway, he published Stanford's achievements in a report in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) on \\"Cardiac transplantation in 150 patients at Stanford University\\". This report was one of the developments that supported the recommencement of heart surgery in the UK under Sir Terence English in 1979. In December 1980, he participated in the first successful human heart transplant using cyclosporine. The recipient was then age 20 and still living in 2017 at the age of 58. Stanford group On 9 March 1981, Jamieson was part of the team that achieved the first long-term survival following a combined heart-lung transplant procedure, led by Bruce Reitz and accompanied by John Wallwork and Norman Shumway. The recipient, a 45-year-old woman with Eisenmenger's syndrome, lived for 5 years. A series of combined heart-lung transplant procedures followed in which alternative blood vessels provided blood to the main airways, reducing bronchial restricted blood supply since the coronary blood vessels remained intact after the bronchial artery had been ligated. Use of cyclosporine reduced acute rejection. Simultaneous work in Toronto, under Joel D. Cooper and the Toronto transplant group also reported success with single-lung transplants and then with en bloc bilateral lung transplants. Over the next two decades, the state of lung transplantation grew and multiple lung transplant centers became global. Bilateral and single- lung transplants continued to account for most procedures performed. Heart- lung transplants became reserved primarily for those patients with the Eisenmenger anomaly or severe primary pulmonary hypertension. Jamieson was responsible for numerous descriptions of early heart-lung and double lung transplant techniques. He co-founded the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) in 1981 and later became its president in 1986. In 1982, Jamieson became the director of heart and lung transplantation at Stanford and retained this position until 1986. Minnesota 200x200px In 1986, Jamieson replaced Walton Lillehei at University of Minnesota as director of the Minnesota Heart and Lung Institute, performing Minnesota's first heart- lung transplant in the same year. In 1988, he performed the Midwest's first double-lung transplant. San Diego 200x200px 200x200px By 1989, Jamieson had transferred his entire surgical team, including Michael Peter Kaye, to the University of California, San Diego. to which he introduced heart-lung, lung, double lung and living-related transplant, and established the first lung transplantation programme to be Medicare certified and co-founded the Sulpizio Cardiovascular Center The International Registry for Heart Transplantation, which possesses global heart and heart-lung transplants records, and the editorial offices of the Journal of Heart Transplantation also moved to UCSD Medical Center.  Heart-lung surgery  200x200px By 1989, he had performed around 500 heart transplants and more than 50 heart-lung transplants. However, due to the shortage of donor supplies, an attempt was made to reduce heart- lung transplants. The heart was increasingly repaired where possible and pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) performed for Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). PTE is an operation that removes organized clotted blood (thrombus) from the pulmonary arteries of people with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Many physicians have been unaware of the existence of CTEPH and as a consequence it has been underdiagnosed. Jamieson was the first to report that CTEPH can be corrected with PTE. Jamieson's 2003 publication, describing the first 1,500 cases of PTE, confirmed the benefits of surgery and dismissed the myth that poor right ventricular function disqualified a patient as fit for surgery. He argued that whatever the degree of right ventricular failure, PTA improved patients lives. While medical management may provide some temporary relief of symptoms, PTE is considered curative for CTEPH. By 2011 there were approximately 30 centers worldwide that offered pulmonary endarterectomy and half of the 4,000 procedures performed were being done by Jamieson's programme directorship at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Jamieson pioneered the procedure of pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE). During his four decades at UCSD, he made modifications to the procedure of PTE, adapted surgical instruments and proposed a classification of CTEPH. Karen (orangutan) In 1994, Jamieson led the team that performed the first open heart surgery on an orangutan, Karen, at San Diego Zoo. He repaired her penny-size hole in the heart when she was two years old. She recovered and made headlines.  Personal life  Jamieson is a cattle rancher and commercial helicopter pilot. He has three children.  Awards  * Irvine H. Page Atherosclerosis Research Prize of the American Heart Association (AHA) (1978). * Ellis Island Medal of Honor (2008). * ISHLT Pioneer Award (2017).

It was found in the Lower Elliot Formation of South Africa, dated to the Norian of the Late Triassic period. The genus contains the type and only species, Pentasaurus goggai. Pentasaurus is named after the ichnogenus Pentasauropus, fossil footprints that were originally described from the lower Elliot Formation in 1970 decades before the body fossils of Pentasaurus itself were recognised. Pentasauropus footprints were likely made by dicynodonts, and in South Africa Pentasaurus itself was the likely trackmaker. The name reflects the fact that a large dicynodont was predicted to have existed in the lower Elliot Formation before any body fossils were recognised, and so Pentasaurus was named after its probable footprints. This is a reversal of the more typical occurrence where fossil footprints are named after their presumed trackmakers. The name of the species honours its collector Alfred Brown, nicknamed \\"Gogga\\", which means \\"bug\\" in Afrikaans. Pentasaurus is also unique for being the only known dicynodont to have coexisted with large sauropodomorph dinosaurs. Prior to its discovery, large sauropodomorphs and dicynodonts were thought to have never ecologically coexisted, with dicynodonts either going extinct prior to large sauropodomorphs evolving or being outcompeted and driven to extinction by the herbivorous dinosaurs. Pentasaurus challenges these assumptions, suggesting that dicynodonts and large sauropodomorphs could be contemporaneous, and may instead have been separated through habitat and dietary preferences. Furthermore, Pentasaurus expands the range of stahleckeriid dicynodonts in the Late Triassic into South Africa, refuting ideas that dicynodonts were geographically restricted by the Late Triassic. Description The fossil remains of Pentasaurus are fragmented and very incomplete, so its overall morphology is poorly understood. However, it was similarly sized to other large Late Triassic dicynodonts, such as the closely related Placerias, and likely resembled them in appearance. Skull and mandible Stereopairs of the skull roof of Pentasaurus viewed from above and below The only known bones from the skull of Pentasaurus is a portion from the roof of the skull, specifically the front end of the intertemporal region consisting of both frontal bones, the left postorbital and the preparietal (a bone unique to dicynodonts and some other therapsids). There are two depressed regions of the skull piece, one along the bottom left side and another cut into the back end, interpreted as representing a site for jaw muscle attachments at the edge of the temporal fenestra and for the pineal foramen, respectively. Otherwise, the skull is notably rough and strongly textured, particularly on a pair of mound- like rugosities at the back edge of the frontals. Frontal rugosities are absent in other kannemeyeriiforms and may be unique to Pentasaurus, although the bones around the eyes of Placerias are similarly rugose.. Only the very front of the mandible of Pentasaurus is known, mostly consisting of the fused mandibular symphysis (including the splenial) and part of the left dentary and angular, although the tip of the beak is missing. The mandible is robust, and like other dicynodonts was fused into a toothless beak. The beak was relatively short in Pentasaurus, with a steep front edge drawn into a mid-line ridge like those of other placeriines, although it is relatively shorter and lacks a pair of grooves typically found on either side of the ridge in other stahleckeriids. The beak is proportionately broader than that of Placerias, and its edges are smoothly rounded and curve towards the tip, unlike the sharp edged, flattened surfaces on the beaks of Placerias or Stahleckeria. A mid- line groove on the top surface of the beak, present in other kannemeyeriiforms, is unusually shallow in Pentasaurus, even more so than the notably shallow groove in Placerias. The lateral dentary shelf, a characteristic ridge on the jaws of dicynodonts for attaching jaw muscles, is unusual in Pentasaurus. It is remarkably robust and prominent, and the shelf sits uniquely far forward on the jaw compared to all other dicynodonts. Further unlike other dicynodonts, the shelf does not extend back to meet the mandibular fenestra either, instead curving up at its end from an otherwise horizontal position. Features such as the shape of the beak and lateral dentary shelf likely influenced the feeding style of dicynodonts, although the significance of the unusual morphology in Pentasaurus is currently unknown. Postcranial skeleton The postcranial skeleton of Pentasaurus is mostly represented by the appendicular skeleton, including parts of the limbs, shoulders and pelvis, with only a single poorly preserved cervical vertebra from the neck representing the axial skeleton. Pelvic bones of Pentasaurus compared to those of the related Placerias, Zambiasaurus and Jachaleria The shoulder is only known from the glenoid region of the fused scapulocoracoid and is typical for stahleckeriid dicynodonts, including a relatively large glenoid opening for the shoulder joint directed back and out to the side, indicating a sprawled forelimb posture. The forelimb itself is only known from the end of the humerus and the proximal portion of the ulna. The humerus is largely typical of kannemeyeriiform dicynodonts in shape, however, the distal end is unusually large and thickened compared to other stahleckeriids. The capitulum (part of the elbow) in the only known specimen is unossified and would have been cartilaginous, suggesting the specimen may be immature compared to similarly sized specimens of Placerias. The known portion of ulna is badly worn, but the roundness of its tip suggests that Pentasaurus had a separated olecranon process of the elbow, similar to Placerias and Ischigualastia but unlike some specimens of Stahleckeria. An unidentified long bone may represent a radius. The pelvis is known from a partial left pubis and ischium and is typical of kannemeyeriiforms, including notable 'twisting' of the pubic shaft. The only known hindlimb element is the proximal end of a right tibia, and likewise it is typical of kannemeyeriiform dicynodonts. Although similar in construction to sauropodomorph dinosaurs, the internal structure visible at the broken end shows extensive trabecular bone, characteristic of Triassic dicynodonts. History of discovery The only known fossil remains of Pentasaurus were collected in the late 19th century by amateur palaeontologist Alfred \\"Gogga\\" Brown, an Englishman recluse who lived for much of his life in Aliwal North in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. His first fossil discoveries began in the 1860s, and his collections largely consisted of tetrapod fossils from the Middle Triassic Beaufort Group and Late Triassic‚ÄìEarly Jurassic Stormberg Group. After initially corresponding with and sending a crate of fossils to the geologist Sir Roderick Murchison in London, Brown's relationships with English and later Parisian scientists soured. However, he later accepted an invitation to have his fossils shipped to the Imperial Natural History Museum, now a part of the Natural History Museum, Vienna in Austria. The fossils of Pentasaurus were part of a lot accessioned in 1876 that was determined to have been collected from a single locality in the Norian aged lower Elliot Formation, based on the shared brown-grey colour of the bones and brown sandstone matrix surrounding them, as well as the association with fossils of the exclusively lower Elliot dinosaur Eucnemesaurus. Prior to the recognition of Pentasaurus body fossils, dicynodonts were inferred to have been present in the lower Elliot Formation from preserved footprints and track ways attributed to them. These ichnofossils were described in 1970 as Pentasauropus incredibilis, and were determined to have most likely been produced by dicynodonts from their large size and five short toes (pentadactyly). Similar trace fossils were identified on other continents, including South and North America, where they were more confidently attributed to large dicynodonts. However, the absence of dicynodont fossils in some localities known to produce Pentasauropus, as well as their younger age compared to known dicynodont genera, led palaeontologists Adrian Hunt and Spencer Lucas to question this identification. Re-examination of Brown's collections in the 21st century revealed that a number of bones belonged to a large dicynodont, and in 2018 they were described by palaeontologist Christian Kammerer as a new genus and species, Pentasaurus goggai. The generic name was derived from the ichnogenus Pentasauropus due to the likely association between the tracks and their track maker. Such nomenclatural associations are not uncommon in palaeontology (e.g. Anchisauripus, Megalosauropus). However, typically the ichnofossil is named after the presumed track maker, whereas this situation is reversed in Pentasaurus. The specific epithet is named in honour and recognition of Alfred Brown and his work, derived from his nickname 'Gogga' (pronounced ), an Afrikaan word loosely translated to \\"bug\\" that the local villagers nicknamed him for this unusual habits. Pentasaurus is only known from several isolated fragments of bone, of which a partial mandible (NHMW 1876-VII-B-114) was made the holotype specimen. However, because the bones were collected from one locality and that none of them are duplicated, as well as their similar sizes, it is possible that they all belong to only a single individual. Although disarticulated from each other, the known bones are characteristic of dicynodonts and cannot be referred to other large animals known from the Elliot Formation, such as 'rauisuchians' or sauropodomorph dinosaurs. The inferred association between Pentasaurus and Pentasauropus incredibilis tracks cannot be definitively proven, as there are no known bones from the hands and feet to compare with the shape of the tracks. However, Pentasaurus is the only known candidate dicynodont track-maker in the Elliot Formation, and as other Norian localities are only ever known to have supported one species of dicynodont, it is almost certain that Pentasaurus produced the Pentasauropus tracks originally identified from the Elliot Formation. Classification Although fragmentary, the known remains of Pentasaurus are clearly dicynodont and are consistent with belonging to the only known family of Late Triassic dicynodonts, the Stahleckeriidae. Furthermore, a number of features of the lower jaw and humerus support its position in the stahleckeriid subfamily Placeriinae, and so as a close relative of the North American Placerias, Moroccan Moghreberia and the giant Polish Lisowicia. A phylogenetic analysis performed by Kammerer (2018) supported this relationship, however, it could not resolve the relationships within Placeriinae beyond a polytomy containing Pentasaurus and all other placeriines, as shown in the cladogram reproduced below. Later phylogenetic analyses including Pentasaurus produced the same results. The beak of Pentasaurus compared to those of other stahleckeriids The precise relationships of Pentasaurus to other placeriines cannot be determined cladistically due to the incompleteness of the known remains, nonetheless, it can still be readily distinguished from other placeriines. Particularly, Pentasaurus is characterised by the rounder shape of the beak on its lower jaw, compared to the more angular, straight edged beaks of Placerias and Moghreberia. The robustness and position of the lateral dentary shelf far forward on the lower jaw is also unique to Pentasaurus among dicynodonts, as well as the thickness of its distal humerus. The paired mound-like rugosities over its frontals may also be a diagnostic trait of Pentasaurus. Palaeoecology The lower Elliot Formation consists mostly of red-purple mudstones and thick, stacked layers of sandstone deposited by meandering river channels on a floodplain. The relatively narrow width (10s of metres) of the sandstone channels indicate that the river channels were stable and did not migrate across the floodplain, and sedimentary structures preserved within the sandstone indicate that the rivers were slow-moving and perennial. The stability of the channels suggests that riparian forests were present along the banks of these rivers, which is further supported by the relatively high abundance of fossilised wood fragments found in the lower Elliot Formation. These riparian environments were separated by extensive floodplains that were less well vegetated, but likewise they show little evidence for desiccation. Overall, the evidence is consistent with a humid to semi-arid climate in the lower Elliot Formation, and was a wetter environment than the dry, arid upper Elliot Formation of the proceeding Early Jurassic. The fauna of the lower Elliot Formation is poorly known compared to the upper Elliot Formation, but they show some similarities to other Norian-aged faunas globally. Only one other therapsid is known from the lower Elliot Formation, the large herbivore Scalenodontoides, a traversodontid cynodont. Archosaurs are better represented, though mostly by several species of herbivorous sauropodomorph dinosaurs. Eucnemesaurus was collected together with Pentasaurus, and so very likely coexisted with it, but Pentasaurus may also have occurred with Blikanasaurus, Sefapanosaurus and Meroktenos, as well as perhaps Melanorosaurus and Plateosauravus depending on their stratigraphic positions. Predatory archosaurs are less well known, but include probable 'rauisuchian' remains, including portions of jaws and teeth that were collected with Pentasaurus. Predatory theropod dinosaurs were also present, but are only known from isolated teeth and footprints. Temnospondyl amphibians are also known from the lower Elliot Formation, but consist of only of chigutisaurids. The footprint record from the lower Elliot Formation records a similar set of fauna to those known from body fossils, although a singular footprint may indicate that crocodylomorphs were also present. Biogeography The lower Elliot sauropodomorph Melanorosaurus readi, a possible contemporary of Pentasaurus The coexistence of Pentasaurus with large sauropodomorph dinosaurs including as Eucnemesaurus in the Elliot Formation is significant, as dicynodonts and large sauropodomorphs are otherwise not known to have coexisted anywhere else in world. Prior to the discovery of Pentasaurus, it was even suggested that the two groups of herbivores never even coexisted at all, and that sauropodomorphs replaced dicynodonts as large herbivores in most Late Triassic ecosystems, either through ecological turnover or by direct competition. The coexistence of Pentasaurus and large sauropodomorphs in the lower Elliot Formation suggests that this may not be the case, and that the two groups may have instead been segregated by habitat preference, and may have fed upon different types of vegetation. Pentasaurus also represents the southernmost example of a placeriine in the world, refuting prior suggestions that placeriine dicynodonts were mostly restricted to the northern hemisphere and demonstrating instead that the group had a more global distribution.

She is considered Australia's first female war correspondent.  Life  Macready was born in 1855 in Rathfriland, Ireland, the eldest of five children of Jane and Henry Macready. The family emigrated to New South Wales when she was 12 years old. When she was 25 she began nursing training at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, followed by further training in Melbourne to become a surgical nurse. In 1898 Macready began writing articles and poems, and creating drawings, for the Sydney newspaper The Catholic Press under the nom de plume Arrah Luen. Some of this work was reprinted in American and Irish newspapers. Agnes was appointed as Matron at the Berrima District Cottage Hospital in the Southern Highland of New South Wales on 11 October 1894. She resigned from this post in December 1898. On 24 October 1899, just two weeks after war was declared in South Africa, Macready bought her own steamship ticket and departed Sydney for Durban, keen to assist with nursing soldiers wounded in the Boer War. She arrived before the first contingent of Australian troops, and initially the British War Office told her that no nurses were needed in the country and advised to leave. However, she was also advised to apply to rural locations, which she did, and was offered a position at Fort Napier Military Hospital in Pietermaritzburg. She carried on to nurse in Ladysmith during and after the town's siege, Wyburg and Pretoria, and in a camp for Boer prisoners at Simon's Town. Prior to leaving Sydney, The Catholic Press had commissioned Macready as a special correspondent, and she filed reports for the newspaper from South Africa on her experiences there. Her writing was often critical of the British and sympathetic to the Boers. In September 1901 Macready returned to Sydney on a hospital ship, overseeing the nursing of wounded soldiers from Dawes Point, Sydney. She became matron of Wyalong Hospital, moving to Kurri Kurri Hospital in 1904. She continued to write for The Catholic Press.

A manga adaptation was serialized in Media Factory's Monthly Comic Alive from March 27, 2018 to February 27, 2019, and an anime film adaptation by Studio Colorido premiered in August 2018. Plot Penguins suddenly appear in the town with no explanation. Aoyama finds that the penguin species is known to follow a singular path known as the \\"Penguin Highway,\\" which leads to the woods. After the bully Suzuki ties Aoyama up to a vending machine, the Lady frees Aoyama and transforms a soda can into a penguin. At school Aoyama finds Uchida and his other classmate Hamamoto with a penguin named Penta on the rooftop. They bring Penta on the train, where it falls ill upon leaving the station. Penta stumbles out of the cage and transforms into a soda can. Aoyama then goes to a cafe to play chess with the Lady, where she mentions her trouble sleeping after reading about the Jabberwock. The power goes out, and then she accidentally transforms the pieces into bats. Aoyama later deduces that the Lady can turn thrown objects into penguins in the light and bats in the dark. The next day, Hamamoto leads Aoyama and Uchida deep into the forest, where a floating sphere of water sits, which she calls the \\"sea\\". The next few days, Aoyama, Uchida, and Hamamoto spend playing around the sea and investigating it. Uchida throws in a toy spaceship into the sphere, and it sucks up the toy. One day, Suzuki comes to bully Uchida and Aoyama, happening upon the sphere, and Hamamoto warns him not to tell anyone about the sphere. The following day, TV reporters note a new unidentified creature has been discovered. Aoyama and Uchida spot the creature eating a penguin. The Lady asks Aoyama to go to the coast with her, and they depart by train. As they leave the station, the Lady falls ill. Her sweat falls onto the ground, liquifying the concrete into the creature ‚Äî a Jaberwock. He does not see the Lady after that for a while. After school, Hamamoto and Uchida go to find the forest blocked off. Entering despite the warnings, they find Hamamoto's father conducting research, with Suzuki revealing the sphere's location. A huge storm brews as the sphere grows in size. The next day, it is revealed that the sphere has expanded to a dangerous extent, leading to the disappearance of Hamamoto's father.

The focus is on the presentation of feature films in the programme. Until 2005, the publishing group Verlagsgruppe Milchstrasse was the publisher of the magazine until it was taken over by Hubert Burda Media. Development  The initial retail price was 3.80 Deutsche Mark, the first print run was 200,000 copies. Initially, the magazine was published monthly, the circulation was almost sold out from the beginning until the publisher increased the print run to 350,000. Five months later, surprised by the success of the magazine, the publishing house changed the publication frequency to biweekly and started it on 1 February 1991 with a circulation of 1.2 million copies, initially at a \\"trial price\\" of 90 Pfennig. The regular price was 2.50 Deutsche Mark per issue. At the end of 2007, the price was increased from 1.45 to 1.50 euros. With issue number 19/1991, the 1.015 million copies sold for the first time exceeded the one million mark at the regular sales price. Thus TV Spielfilm was the first successful new introduction in this magazine segment since 1983 (Auf einen Blick, die zwei, Bildwoche). The circulation increased almost continuously until 1996; according to the IVW circulation list, the highest paid circulation was 2.763 million copies in the second quarter. Since 1998 there has been an initially slow but steady decline, with an average of around 1.5 million copies sold in 2007. In 2008, sales remained at an average of 1.46 million, the number of subscribers was just under 630,000 (2007: 640,000). Target group At the beginning, the target group was a young readership with a \\"slightly male focus\\"; at the time of its monthly publication, the paper was conceived as a \\"second edition of the programme\\",Werben & Verkaufen, 33/1990, S. 38 as it did not yet contain a complete programme section at that time. The magazine was mainly bought by readers who were unfamiliar with established magazines such as H√∂rzu or TV H√∂ren und Sehen.Horizont 2/1991, S. 17 They then tried to establish a new type of magazine by switching to a biweekly publication method, which eventually succeeded.Werben & Verkaufen, 1-2/1991, S. 62 Market response Since the concept of the sheet-makers worked (\\"Sprengmeister der etablierten Ordnung\\"Media Spectrum 10/1992, S. 40) and the success could no longer be overlooked, Bauer Verlag reacted and released its own feature film title TV Movie in December 1991, which copied the concept of TV Spielfilm and thus triggered a charge of plagiarism.text intern 4/1992, S. 1 The evaluation of feature films by symbols (\\"high\\", \\"cross\\" and \\"deep thumbs\\"), which was carried out for the first time in TV Spielfilm, has been adopted by almost all TV guides in a modified form (stars, points) over the course of time; even in free supplements, ratings now appear in some cases. In the same way, the timeline, in which simultaneous program parts are almost eroded in a horizontal line, became a model for established journals as well as for journals that later appeared. The biweekly publication became the model for later magazines such as tv14, which was the best-selling TV guide on the market in 2007. Online Website TV Spielfilm operates an extensive internet portal tvspielfilm.de with information on many TV and cinema films and a complete TV programme even for exotic pay TV programmes and Dutch TV channels. The user can also find the daily tips here. After a free registration the user can adapt this offer by selecting his own favourite stations and dividing them into groups of five. The linear day program can then be displayed next to each other for the stations in a group. When searching, which can also search for programme formats and feature film genres, registered users can also restrict the channels searched to their favourite stations. Registered users can reserve shipments and be notified by e-mail a few hours before the broadcast. The user will also be notified if a film he or she has marked in the film archive appears on television in five days. Apps TV Spielfilm offers mobile apps for Android, iOS and Windows Phone, which include the complete TV program as well as daily tips in various categories. The applications have a notification function for TV programs and a customizable channel list. Since the settings are tied to the phone, there is no registration. On the iPad, there are different views for the program, while on the other devices all programs are always sorted by time and, if necessary, by position of the station in the personal channel list. The free apps are financed by advertising. TV Spielfim XXL TV Spielfilm XXL is an extended version of the program guide, which appears simultaneously with the standard version, but includes more programs. In addition to conventional Free TV, the digital programme bouquets of Sky Deutschland, Vodafone Kabel Deutschland, Unitymedia, Kabelkiosk, Telekom Entertain are also published. A total of more than 100 programs are listed. For the Free TV channels, however, fewer feature film ratings are included than in the normal TV Spielfim. TV Spielfilm live TV Spielfilm live is the streaming media service of TV Spielfilm which was launched in July 2015. The service can optionally be used completely free of charge with access to 50 TV channels, but in SD quality and with advertising.

Early life Bent was on July 28, 1879 in Steelton, Pennsylvania to Luther Stedman Bent, superintendent of the Pennsylvania Steel Company's plant at Steelton, and Mary Stearns Felton Bent, daughter of Pennsylvania Steel president Samuel Morse Felton Sr. When Felton died in 1889, Luther S. Bent succeed him as president and the family relocated to Philadelphia. Career Bent graduated from Williams College in 1901, and began working at Pennsylvania Steel's Steelton plant. In 1909, he was named assistant to the president of the Maryland Steel Company, a subsidiary of Pennsylvania Steel. In 1916, Pennsylvania Steel was acquired by Bethlehem Steel and Bent became general manager of the Steelton plant. Bethlehem chairman Charles M. Schwab described Bent as \\"the biggest asset we bought in Pennsylvania Steel\\". In 1918 he was appointed vice president in charge of steel division operations, which placed him in charge of all the company's steel plants. During World War II, Bent was a member of the Steel Advisory Committee of the Army and Navy Munitions Board, and chaired two committees of the War Production Board. In 1944, Bent was awarded the American Iron and Steel Institute's Gary Medal \\"for outstanding leadership in the art of steel production and in contributions to the development of alloy steels to meet the needs of war emergency\\". Bent retired on November 1, 1947, but remained on as a director and vice president in an advisory and consulting capacity until December 31, 1947. Bent was also a trustee of Williams College and a member of the American Iron and Steel Institute, the Iron and Steel Institute of Britain, and the American Society of Mining and Metallurgic Engineers. Personal life On January 4, 1910, Bent married Deborah Norris Brock. They had one son - Horace Brock Bent. The family resided at Wyhill Farms near Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. In 1914, Bent built Quattro Venti, a 15-room Tuscan- style summer home in Annisquam, Massachusetts furnished mostly with purchases made by Deborah Norris Bent during her visits to Italy. Saugus Iron Works Louise E. du Pont Crowninshield, one of the directors of the First Iron Works Association, an organization dedicated to preserving the site of the first integrated ironworks in North America, approached Bent for a financial contribution. Bent visited the site and was intrigued by the property's slag pile, which indicated that it could contain the remains of an iron works. Bent eventually convinced the American Iron and Steel Institute to fund the restoration of the Iron Works. The restoration was completed in 1954 and the Saugus Iron Works opened as a private museum run by the First Iron Works Association and funded by the American Iron and Steel Institute. After the AISI stopped funding the museum it was added to the National Park Service system. Death Bent died on May 5, 1955 at Wyhill Farms following a long illness.

The incident caused no deaths. Il-18B bearing number 75672 (factory 189000901 and serial 009-01) was constructed by the factory of MMZ \\"Banner Of Labor\\" in 1959 and was handed over to General Directorate of Civil Air Fleet, which on April 19 transferred it to Vnukovo Air Squadron of the Moscow Department of Transport Aviation of the Civil Air Fleet. The passenger capacity of the airliner was of 80 seats. On April 24 it made its first flight from Moscow Domodedovo to Alma-Ata. The plane was on a flight from Moscow to Sochi. It was driven by crew consisting of the commander B. E. Gratsianov, 2nd pilot Y. N. Belkin, sturman B. A. Andreev, flight mechanic G. D. Postribailo, radio operator G. Y. Margulis. The pilots had little experience in piloting Il-18: Gratsianov was making his 2nd flight as commander, Belkin was making his 1st flight after re-training. The stewardesses were V. E. Zhuravleva, N. V, Pokhitonova and V. Y. Smirnova. 89 passengers were on board. After taking off Vnukovo Airport the plane ascended to 6100 meters. Flying over Tula oblast, a fire alarm went off for the engine #3. The crew activated the fire extinguishing system, but it didn't work. At the time, flight instructions contained no descriptions of this kind of situation. The nearest airfield was a military Efremov-3 (9 km south-east from Efremov town), that was reachable in several minutes. But the crew decided they were too short of time, so they started trying to make a forced landing on fields below them using emergency descent. Before starting, they radioed: \\"Landing on field. Plane on fire. End of link\\", and the link was broken. While on fire, Il-18 leveled with the ground, the crew turned off 3 remaining engines. With gear up, the plane belly landed atop of an oat field in Bogoroditskiy rayon of Tula oblast, slipped 300 meters and stopped. The fire was extinguished quickly, nobody of the 97 people onboard died. The cause of the fire was destruction of the generator which debris damaged the oil pipeline. The oil spilled and caused fire. The fire extinguishing system didn't activate because electric terminals of its circuit scheme were mixed up. For the inventiveness and courage, all of the crew members were awarded in Moscow Kremlin: the commander Boris Evgenievich Gratsianov ‚Äî Order of the Red Banner of Labour; 2nd pilot Yuri Nikolaevich Belkin ‚Äî Order of Red Star; sturman Boris Anatolievich Andreev ‚Äî Order of Red Star; flight mechanic Georgiy Dmitrievich Postribailo ‚Äî Order of Red Star; radio operator Grigoriy Yakovlevich Margulis ‚Äî Order of the Badge of Honor; stewardesses Valentina Efimovna Zhuravleva, Nataliya Vasilyevna Pokhitonova and Valentina Yurievna Smirnova ‚Äî Medal \\"For Distinguished Labour\\".

Description and history The George Baldwin House stands in western North Branford, on the north side of Foxon Road (Connecticut Route 80) near its junction with Arthur Road. It is a modest single-story wood frame structure, covered with a truncated hip roof and wooden clapboard siding. It is nearly square in plan, with a projecting entrance bay at the center of the street-facing facade. It has two Doric columns set in antis in front of the entrance, which has flanking sidelights and a transom window. The building is encircled by a broad entablature. Windows are rectangular sash, with lightly moulded framing. The interior is arranged in a central hall plan with four flanking rooms, but has little of its original decorative elements. With The construction date of this house is not known with certainty, owing to disagreements among documentary and oral history records. Based on its stylistic appearance, it was probably built in 1830s. Its attribution to New Haven architect Ithiel Town is also uncertain, but is plausible based on the building's design, which includes academically correct proportions for its Greek Revival elements. It is also rendered plausible by the possible association of Town with Micah Baldwin, a New York City merchant who was the uncle and financial benefactor of George Baldwin, a farmer of modest means.

Safeena being called ‚Äúdulhan‚Äù by Abida that leads to a good friendship between them. However, later in series it is clear that Dabeer is the villain and the murderer of all these innocent little girls and now has his eyes over Abida. One day when returning from school Abida goes missing But she's later found in the house of Arifa as her(arifas) mentally ill mother had taken her there. Shehnaz's mother in law forces her son to remarry so that he can have a son and the marriage is set between Shaheer around 40 and a young girl around 16. The girl had been a victim of sexual abuse. On the day of wedding Dabeer cons Jahan Ara, sister in law of Shehnaz who likes Dabeer and somehow manages to kidnap Abida. She goes missing for two days while police does nothing to help them. Later she's discovered on a heap of garbage. Abida's death leaves a great impact on Shehnaz and Safeena as they start crying for vengeance. As they are some weak women of the society and hold no importance. They make a video and make it viral on internet. This was the first step towards their mission. Anyhow they convince more women who‚Äôve faced the same issue to come out and make their voices heard. the men of the town including the police officer try to shut the voices of these women by opening a fire in Shaheer's and Shehnaz's house. All of them are recovered though Shaheer being slightly injured. During this period both Shehnaz and Safeena feel something fishy about Dabeer. The second attempt of the men to shut their voices was by shooting Safeena but she turns out fine as the bullet only touched her. Samreen, the sister if Dabeer somehow discovers the truth but he kidnaps her and leaves her to die in an empty house with no food or water and tells everyone that she has eloped with some guy. Later it is revealed that Safeena, Shehnaz and Yawar(Dabeer's brother) believe that Dabeer is behind all this. Safeena finds out the truth by showing that dumb girl who had once been a victim of sexual abuse, a picture of Dabeer and she confirms it for her. On the other hand, all the men of the town were forced to have their DNA tests done by the police. While on her way back Safeena finds Dabeer going somewhere on his bike, she follows him and then later Samreen is rescued and Dabeer is put in jail. Even after the results had come out, Dabeer had been proven guilty and had even accepted his crime in the custody of police. Many people of the town wanted him to be free. Sheikh a prominent member of the town promises Dabeer's father to hire an expensive lawyer for him in exchange of marriage with Samreen. The deal is done and the first hearing of case is almost won by Dabeer. The bill of hanging the pedophiles in front of the whole town had passed and now Safeena and Shehnaz were adamant on that. Safeena gets divorce and then is later kidnapped by the ex- police officer. The drama ends with Dabeer being hanged in front of the whole town as he sees the faces of all the 12 innocent girls he had killed.

Built about 1819, it is a well-preserved late example of Georgian Colonial architecture, associated with a prominent local family. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Timothy Baldwin House is located in a suburban residential area east of Branford center, on the north side of Damascus Road just east of its junction with Patrick Lane. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. A single-story ell extends to the right of the main block. The main block is five bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by symmetrically placed sash windows. The entrance is framed by pilasters and a peaked lintel. With The house was probably built about 1819, around the time of the marriage of Timothy Baldwin. It was probably built by Timothy's father Zaccheus, who gave his son of farmland at the time. The Baldwin family was one of the first to settle this area of Branford. This house remained in that family until 1913.

The tower named after a powerful Prince of Suzdal and Nizhny Novgorod Dmitry of Suzdal. Another version claims that the name gave a church which was sanctified of the name of Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki. This church was located opposite the tower.  History  The Dmitrievskaya Tower was built between 1500 and 1516 during the construction of the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin. Its earliest mention comes in 1516 in the chronicle. After 1782 the Dmitrievskaya Tower began to disintegrate and redevelop. The Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin has been completely renovated between 1785 and 1790. Part of the tower above the gates was completely reconstructed. Wall thicknesses was reduced, loopholes were replaced by rectangular windows. Low slanting iron roof was erected. In the early 18th the Kremlin walls and the Dmitrievskaya Tower were traditionally painted white, in accordance with fashion. Height of the tower decreased by 6 m after back filling of a moat between 1834 and 1837 around the Kremlin. A garrison school for soldierly children occupied the tower at the end of the 18th century and the early the 19th century. The fortress become dilapidated meanwhile. Between 1958 and 1856 the tower was occupied by the provincial government?s archival depository.

Large windows were installed instead of straight teeth, decorating machicolations. Caravans were built up above the West-European-style. The museum was opened in 1896. At the opening ceremony of the museum, Emperor Nicholas II and his wife attended. In 1913 a big celebration was held in honor of the 300th anniversary of the Romanov family near the Dmitrievskaya Tower. The art and historical museum was located in the Dmitrievsky Tower until 1919.

When Irish public tax scandals concerning the Section 110 SPV, also regulated by the CBI, emerged in 2016‚Äì2017, the CBI upgraded the little-used LQIAIF, to give the same benefits as Section 110 SPVs, but with full confidentiality and tax secrecy. Qualifying Investor Alternative Investment Fund or QIAIF is a Central Bank of Ireland regulatory classification established in 2013 for Ireland's five tax-free legal structures for holding assets. The Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicle or ICAV is the most popular of the five Irish QIAIF structures, and was designed in 2014 to rival the Cayman Island SPC; it is the main tax-free structure for foreign investors holding Irish assets. In 2018, the Central Bank of Ireland expanded the Loan Originating QIAIF or L‚ÄìQIAIF regime which enables the five tax-free structures to be used for closed-end debt instruments. The L‚ÄìQIAIF is Ireland's main Debt‚Äìbased BEPS tool as it overcomes the lack of confidentiality and tax secrecy of the Section 110 SPV. It is asserted that many assets in QIAIFs and LQIAIFs are Irish assets being shielded from Irish taxation. Irish QIAIFs and LQIAIFs can be integrated with Irish corporate base erosion and profit shifting (\\"BEPS\\") tax tools to create confidential routes out of the Irish tax system to Ireland's main Sink OFC, Luxembourg. In March 2019, the UN identified Ireland's \\"preferential tax regimes\\" for foreign funds on Irish assets as affecting the human rights of tenants in Ireland. Features Irish QIAIFs are subject to the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011 (‚ÄúAIFMD‚Äù) which lays out detailed rules on the process of constructing (e.g. diversification, leverage), managing (e.g. AIFM approved managers), and marketing (e.g. qualifying investors) of QIAIFs in Europe. However, the following are considered the most important features specific to Irish QIAIFs: As at 2016, ‚Ç¨435 billion in alternative assets were held in Irish QIAIFs. Ireland is the 4th largest domicile for Alternative Investment Funds (\\"AIF\\") in the EU with 9.9% of the ‚Ç¨4.4 trillion EU AIF market, behind Germany (31.7%), France (21.3%) and Luxembourg (13%). It is asserted that a material amount of QIAIF assets (or AIF assets) are Irish assets being shielded from Irish taxation. ICAV Each of the five QIAIF legal wrappers have attributes designed for different uses. However, outside of entities that need the specific attributes of a trust law (and will use the Unit Trust QIAIF), or can only use a full company structure (and will use a VCC QIAIF), the ICAV is expected to be the dominant QIAIF wrapper. * ICAV (or Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicle). Launched in 2014 for U.S. investors to avoid both U.S. tax and Irish tax on Irish investments; ICAVs became the most popular Irish structure for avoiding Irish taxes on Irish assets; ICAVs meet the U.S. ‚Äúcheck-the-box‚Äù entity criteria (i.e. the ICAV is shielded from U.S. tax); ICAV filings are confidential to the Central Bank (e.g. no public CRO filings; even the Irish Revenue cannot see the filings); ICAV governance rules are the weakest of all wrappers and having their own legal identity exempts them from Irish and EU company law; ICAVs are shown to be superior tax avoidance wrappers to the Cayman Island SPCs, and there are provisions to migrate from Cayman/BVI wrappers; most new Irish QIAIFs are structured as ICAVs. * Variable Capital Company (\\"VCC\\") (or Investment Company or PLC). An Irish company subject to Irish and EU company law; must have asset diversification; cannot \\"check-the- box\\" for U.S. investors (which makes it ineffective for U.S. investors holding Irish assets compared to an ICAV); requires substantive governance procedures and reporting requirements; required to file public CRO accounts (and can be scrutinised by the Irish financial media); the VCC is less popular since the introduction of ICAVs in 2014 and is rarely used for new Irish QIAIFs. * Unit Trust. Dates from 1990 and offers similar features to the ICAV (e.g. U.S. \\"check-the-box\\" functionality, no risk spreading, light governance); unlike an ICAV, it cannot be self-managed and must have an AIFM; Irish trust law has complex tax planning features (e.g. separation of legal and beneficial ownership) which are attractive to individual investors and specific jurisdictions (e.g. U.K. and Japan). * Common Contractual Fund (\\"CCF\\"). Established in 2003 for pensions funds to comingle, or pool, assets but maintain full legal segregation of the assets; it is an unincorporated body with no legal identity whose existence is the contract between its investors and the manager; the Irish equivalent of the fonds commun de placement (\\"FCF\\") structure in Luxembourg. * Investment Limited Partnership (\\"ILP\\"). Primarily aimed at private equity‚Äìtype structures with a General Partner (\\"GP\\")/Limited Partner (\\"LP\\") system; dates from the 1994 Investment Limited Partnerships Act; like a unit trust or CCF, the ILP is a contract and not a separate legal identity; the ICAV is more popular for private equity funds in Ireland. L-QIAIF Stephen Donnelly TD uncovered abuses of Section 110 SPVs in 2016, and warned that making Commercial Property tax-free to foreign investors, via QIAIFs, would cause an office bubble and a housing crisis. Ireland is considered by some academic studies to be a major tax haven, and offshore financial centre, with a range of base erosion and profit shifting (\\"BEPS\\") tools. Ireland's main Debt‚Äìbased BEPS tool was the Section 110 SPV. However, Irish public tax scandals in 2016 concerning the use of this BEPS tool ‚Äì involving artificial Irish children's charities ‚Äì by U.S. distressed funds, assisted by the leading Irish tax-law firms, to avoid billions in Irish taxes damaged its reputation (see Section 110 abuses). In late 2016, the Central Bank of Ireland began a consultation process to upgrade the little-used L‚ÄìQIAIF regime. In February 2018, the Central Bank of Ireland changed its AIF \\"Rulebook\\" to allow L‚ÄìQIAIFs hold the same assets that Section 110 SPVs could own. However, the upgraded L-QIAIFs offered two specific improvements over the Section 110 SPV which make L‚ÄìQIAIFs a superior Debt‚Äìbased BEPS tool: Three months after the Irish Central Bank updated its AIF \\"Rulebook\\", the Irish Revenue Commissioners issued new guidance in May 2018 on Section 110 SPV taxation which would further reduce their attractiveness as a mechanism to avoid Irish taxes on Irish assets. In June 2018, the Central Bank of Ireland reported that ‚Ç¨55 billion of U.S.-owned distressed Irish assets, equivalent to almost 25% of Irish GNI*, moved out of Section 110 SPVs. The L-QIAIF, and the ICAV wrapper, in particular, is expected to become an important structure for managing Irish tax on Irish assets in a confidential manner. Ireland has Irish Real Estate Funds (IREFs) for holding direct Irish property which are not tax- free, their holdings relate to Irish quoted REITs (e.g. Green REIT plc), and insurance assets. The investments by US distressed debt funds in Irish property are via loan acquisitions and thus use L-QIAIFs. In addition, foreign investors in Irish property can still use the L-QIAIF by holding via structured loans domiciled abroad, thus also avoiding Irish taxes in a confidential manner. Abuses Comparison of the sales price as multiple of the cost of build, for a prime office in Dublin, with EU‚Äì28 countries (2016). The QIAIF regime has contributed to making the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) one of the largest fund domiciling and shadow banking locations in Europe. Many asset managers, and particularly alternative investment managers, use Irish QIAIF wrappers in structuring funds. However, fund structuring is a competitive market and other corporate tax havens such as Luxembourg offer equivalent products. It is asserted that many of the assets in Irish QIAIFs are Irish assets, and particularly from the sale of over ‚Ç¨100 billion in distressed assets by the Irish State from 2012‚Äì2017. Comparison of the sales price of Dublin prime office with EU‚Äì28 countries (2016). Irish QIAIFs have been used in tax avoidance on Irish assets. It transpired that the regulator of Irish QIAIFs, the Central Bank of Ireland, was paying rent to a U.S. entity using an Irish QIAIF ICAV to avoid Irish taxes on the rent. Irish QIAIFs have been used to circumvent international regulations, on avoiding tax laws in the EU and the U.S. Irish QIAIFs can be combined with Irish corporate BEPS tools (e.g. the Orphaned Super‚ÄìQIF), to create confidential routes out of the Irish corporate tax system to other tax havens such as Luxembourg, the main Sink OFC for Ireland. QIAIFs link Ireland's strength as a corporate-focused tax haven, with the world's largest corporate BEPS tools, to more traditional tax haven type activities (why Cayman SPCs are re-domiciling as Irish ICAVs). The launch of the Irish ICAV was widely covered, and praised, by the leading offshore magic circle law firms, the largest of which, Maples and Calder, claimed to have been one of its chief architects. The ability of foreign institutions to use QIAIFs and the ICAV wrapper, to avoid Irish taxes on Irish assets, has been linked to the bubble in Dublin commercial property, and by implication, the Dublin housing crisis. Despite Dublin's housing crisis, and issues of housing affordability, foreign landlords (also called \\"cuckoo funds\\") operate in Ireland on a tax- free basis. It is asserted that property development, and over-inflation of property prices via tax incentives, are favoured historical economic strategies of the two main Irish political parties, Fianna F√°il and Fine Gael. This risk of QIAIFs was highlighted in 2014 when Central Bank of Ireland consulted the European Systemic Risk Board (\\"ESRB\\") after initial, and unsuccessful, lobbying by IFSC tax-law firms to expand the L‚ÄìQIAIF regime, so as to remove Irish taxation from Irish loan investments. In March 2019, the UN Special Rapporter on housing, Leilani Farha, formally wrote to the Irish Government on behalf of the UN, regarding its concerns regarding \\"preferential tax laws\\" for foreign investment funds on Irish assets which were compromising the human rights of tenants in Ireland. In April 2019, Irish technology entrepreneur Paddy Cosgrave launched a Facebook campaign to highlight abuses of QIAIFs and L-QIAIFs, stating: \\"The L-QIAIF runs the risk of being a weapon of mass destruction\\".

Farrenberg has competed at three Paralympic Games beginning with the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing. He won his only medal at his home games in Rio in 2016, a silver in the 50 metres freestyle. As well as his Paralympic medal, Farrenberg has also won multiple medals at World Championship level. Personal history Farrenberg was born in S√£o Paulo, Brazil in 1980. He was born with congenital toxoplasmosis which resulted in his vision gradually failing until stabilising at the age of 13 leaving him with 20 percent of normal vision. He was educated at the Faculty of Physical Education in Santos. He is married to Tatyana and they had their first child in 2015. Swimming career Farrenberg was introduced to swimming as a child but gave up the sport as a teenager. At University he took up goalball, but then heard of trials for disabled swimmers for the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens and decided to try out. Despite being away from the pool for ten years and with only a month of training, Farrenberg broke three Brazilian swimming records for the S13 class during the trails. Unfortunately for Farrenberg these times were not sufficient to allow him to qualify for Athens, but it spurred him on to take up swimming professionally again. He first represented Brazil at the 2006 IPC World Swimming Championships in Durban winning a silver medal in the 100 metre freestyle (S13). Farrenberg competed in his first Summer Paralympics in 2008 in Beijing. He competed in four events, with his best result being a fourth place in the 50 metre freestyle. In 2009 he competed in the IPC World Short Course Championship, held in Brazil. He won five medals including an individual gold in the 100 metre freestyle. The following year he won a bronze in the 2010 World Championships in Eindhoven. Farrenberg qualified for his second Paralympics in 2012, travelling to London to compete in four events. He managed to get through two of the heats finishing sixth in the 50 metres freestyle and 8th in the 100 metres. In the build-up to the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Brazil, he won a silver in the 50 metre S13 at the 2015 IPC Swimming World Championships in Glasgow. At the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro he entered just two events, the 50 metre and 100 metre freestyles. He came through the heats of the 100 metres and finished fifth in the finals.

The cemetery contains in excess of 11,000 German military personnel and is maintained and managed by the German War Graves Commission (Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr√§berf√ºrsorge). History Marigny was originally the site of a battlefield cemetery, established by the United States Army Graves Registration Service during the war, where American and German soldiers, sailors and airmen were buried in two adjacent fields. In 1945 and 1946 the American war dead were relocated 3,070 graves to the cemetery in St. Laurent-sur-Mer. In 1957 the Reburial Service of the German War Graves Commission interred German soldiers from numerous small graveyards and field graves at Marigny. The graveyard was created as five long blocks of graves with a banked outer boundary. Ceramics plaques bear the name, rank, and dates of birth and death of two soldiers. The cemetery contains a total of 11,169 graves. In 1958 the buildings and gardens were created by the German War Graves Commission. The main entrance to the graveyard was built in the style of Norman a Norman village church. The cemetery is now surrounded by a stone wall. The cemetery was inaugurated on September 20, 1961. Personal fates The majority of the fallen in the graveyard date from the American advance during Operation Cobra in the summer of 1944.

Built in 1875 for a congregation founded in 1819, it is the oldest church building in the town, and a distinctive example of Gothic Revival architecture designed by New Hampshire native Frederick N. Footman. The church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. The congregation is affiliated with the United Church of Christ. Description and history The First Congregational Church stands in the town center of Farmington, on the west side of Main Street (New Hampshire Route 153) at Pleasant Street. It is a red brick building, with a basically rectangular plan covered by a gabled roof. A square tower projects from the left front corner, rising and housing a clock and belfry before terminating in a steeple surmounted by a cross. The bell was dedicated in 1918 to the memory of politician Henry Wilson, who was a member of the congregation in his youth. The interior retains a number of original features, including chair rails, Gothic choir pews, and massive wooden roof trusses. It has a series of particularly fine stained glass windows that are original to its construction. The church was built in 1875 to a design to Frederick Footman. Footman was a native of Somersworth, who was one of the first enrollees in the architecture program of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The congregation was founded in 1819, and built its first dedicated sanctuary across the street in 1844. That building burned during a blizzard in 1875, and the present building was constructed on land donated by a wealthy local businessman.

Cannonball and Meltdown stopped the Sword, and Arcadia changed some of them into crystal so that she could smash them. Moonstar touched Arcadia trying to stop her, but Arcadia's power went into Moonstar and shared Arcadia's powers with her. Ulysses stopped Arcadia, and the Sword members reverted to their normal forms. Ulysses and Arcadia continued on the run with the Sword as prisoners on their own ship.X-Force #84 Arcadia began having dreams about the Demon Bear. She and Ulysses went to Sledge's junkyard because they knew that the Damocles Foundation intended to activate a Gatherer of the Celestials.

Farha, and KLPR account executive Monty Wells ‚Äì submitted an application to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit to build and license to operate a broadcast television station in the Oklahoma City market that would transmit on UHF channel 19. The FCC eventually granted the license to KLPR Television on February 11, 1953. While the station was known as KLPR-TV at launch, the legal callsign used instead was KMPT, which had been assigned in July. At launch, KLPR-TV programming included DuMont shows and ABC professional football telecasts. The station also made headlines for a unique policy under Ross; not wanting to see his station drive anyone to alcoholism, he refused to accept advertisements from alcoholic beverage companies on the station. That stance, however, only lasted as long as Ross ran the station; on January 26, 1954, he resigned, citing differences with the board of directors, and the station lifted the ban. The station also began using the KMPT callsign in local media at this time. Within weeks of Ross resigning, and already facing a lawsuit seeking $27,000 from the company that installed the tower, KLPR Television, Inc., filed for bankruptcy, stating it was more than $250,000 in debt. The bankruptcy petition did not affect KLPR radio, but the situation scared off Gordon McLendon, who had been in negotiations to buy a stake in the station, but did not take over management and opted out, finding KMPT \\"too far gone\\". On April 27, the FCC approved the transfer of channel 19 to trustee and receiver Everett E. Cotter. The station remained on air until the night of February 2, 1955, the day before a federal judge signed an order to close down KMPT. Creditors blamed KMPT's inability to draw sufficient advertising revenue as the reason for its demise. Following its shutdown, attempts were made to utilize KMPT's former facilities and channel allocation. The Republic Television and Radio Company proposed utilizing the KMPT transmitter facility to operate ABC affiliate KTVQ (channel 25, allocation now occupied by Fox affiliate KOKH-TV) as part of a proposal to relaunch that station on VHF channel 11, which had been assigned to Tulsa as a non-commercial allocation and was granted to the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority (OETA) for KOED-TV, a planned satellite of its Oklahoma City flagship KETA-TV (channel 13). The proposal was twice denied by the FCC: first on February 1, 1956, and again on July 5, 1956. On May 3, 1957, movie theater operator Malco Theaters Inc. applied to operate a television station on channel 19. Another application would be filed for the allocation in 1962 by the new owners of KLPR, doing business as KLPR-TV, Inc. The FCC granted the application in 1965, but after an overhaul of UHF allocations nationwide, the new KLPR-TV, which would broadcast in 1966 and 1967, would do so on channel 14.

The total area of the district was 111,600km2 \\\\- the district's length from west to east at the widest point was 340 kilometres, and from north to south was 540 kilometres. When the district was created, the administrative centre was the village of Strelka-Chunya. However, in 1935, the administrative centre was changed to the village of Vanavara. The reason for the change was the distance of Strelka-Chunya from the district's main waterway, Podkammenoy Tunguski, which caused difficulties in communication with other settlements in the district. The district contained 5 settlements (postal codes in brackets): * The village of Vanavara (648490) - population 2,943 * The village of Mutoray (648483) - population 90 * The village of Oskoba (648484) - population 13 * The village of Strelka-Chunya (648482) - population 184 * The village of Chemdalsk (648481) - population 51 The distances of the other settlements from Vanavara vary between 160 kilometres and 200 kilometres.

Biography  Wulf was born 17 May 1895 in Bremen. He was the son of a customs agent. He attended the high school on Dechanat Street. Around 1910, Henrich Focke, with the help of his brother Wilhelm Focke, built a simple canard airplane of steel tubes and bamboo. It was powered by an eight-horsepower engine. Their attempts to fly on the Bremen paradeground failed, but they awoke an interest of the 15 year old Wulf. Wulf was so enthusiastic about flying that he quit before he graduated from high school and instead made airplanes. He offered to work with Focke, which Focke accepted. Starting in 1911, Wulf and Focke designed aircraft and built them with the simplest means. In 1912 they completed a flyable monoplane, which Wulf flew. The treaty ending World War I prohibited aircraft with engines from being built in Germany, until 1923. But Wulf and the Focke brothers secretly continued to build their aircraft in the basement of the Focke family house. After 1921 Wulf flew the aircraft they built. In 1923 Wulf also worked as a flight instructor. Also in 1923, the \\"'Bremen Aircraft Construction Company (Bremer Flugzeugbau- Gesellschaft) was founded by Focke and Wulf, which was renamed Focke-Wulf- Aircraft Construction Inc. (Focke-Wulf-Flugzeugbau AG) a year later. Wulf was the managing director, the technical director of operations, and a pilot. As a preliminary study, they had built a light monoplane, which first flew in November 1921. This was followed by the known under the name Seagull and duck commercial aircraft. Death On September 29 1927, Wulf died while testing a prototype of the F 19a Ente aircraft. Wulf is buried in Bremen in the Osterholzer cemetery (field E), near the bridge to the North Chapel.

The total area of the district was 497,600 km2, roughly twice the size of Great Britain. Around one third of the district's territory lay to the north of the Arctic Circle. The administrative centre of the district, as well as of the former Evenk AO, was the town of Tura.

Born to an Irish soldier in the British Indian Army, she fell in love and married Parsi actor-director Kavasji Palanji Khatau. He introduced her to acting and she had a successful stage career. Early life Mary Fenton was born in Landour near Mussoorie in India to Jannette and Mathew Fenton, an Irish retired soldier of the British Indian Army. She was baptized as Mary Jane Fenton, but there is no further information of her early life and education. Parsi theatre actor-director Kavasji Palanji Khatau was rehearsing for his play Inder Sabha, when Fenton had come to book the hall for her magic lantern show. She admired his acting, met him, fell in love and finally married him. Subsequently, she adopted a Parsi name Mehrbai. She already knew Hindi and Urdu, and in the 1870s Khatau gave her further training in singing and acting. She created a sensation in the theatre due to her talent and relationship with Khatau. However, following a dispute between Khatau and the Empress Victoria Theatrical Company owner Jahangir Pestonjee Khambatta regarding Fenton's entry into theatre in 1878, Khatau left Bombay for Delhi and joined Alfred Theatre Company owned by Manek Master who also opposed Fenton. Consequently, Khatau started his own Alfred Company in 1881, where Fenton had a long and successful career. Fenton and Khatau later separated. They had a son Jahangir Khatau. Career She was the first Anglo-Indian actress of the Parsi, Gujarati, and Urdu theatre. She became popular for her roles as the Parsi heroine. She acted in Nanabhai Ranina's Nazan Shirin (1881), Bamanji Kabra's Bholi Gul (Innocent Flower, 1882, based on Ellen Wood's English novel East Lynne), Agha Hasan Amanat's Urdu opera Inder Sabha, Khambatta's Khudadad (The Gift of God, 1898, based on Shakespeare's Pericles, Prince of Tyre), Gamde ni Gori (Village Nymph, 1890), Alauddin (1891), Tara Khurshid (1892), Kaliyug (1895) and Kalidasa's Sanskrit play Shakuntala. Her role of Jogan in Gopichand was much appreciated. She had later worked with Framji Apu's theatre company and changed several theatre troupes thereafter. Mary Fenton is believed to have died at the age of 42, probably in 1896. Hence, she was probably born in 1854 and had met Khatau in 1878. Her introduction in the Parsi theatre opened the way for a large number of Anglo-Indian actresses which dominated the early stage, as well as the films of the silent era of India.  In popular culture  Drama Queen (2018) was a play written and directed by Neeyati Rathode, and produced by Blue Feather Theatre based on her life and other early female actresses. Mehrin Saba played Mary Fenton.

Location  Former Baykitsky district on a map of Evenkia Baykitsky district was located in the south-western area of the Evenk Autonomous Okrug. The district shared borders with (clockwise from the north) Ilimpiyskiy and Tungussko-Chunsky districts within the Evenk AO, and Boguchansky, Motyginsky, Severo-Yeniseysky, Yeniseysky, and Turukhansky districts of Krasnoyarsk Krai. The total area of the district was 102,000 km2 and the administrative centre was the town of Baykit.  Geography  The district was located in the Central Siberian Plateau, around 500‚Äì600 metres above sea level, in the middle course of the Podkamennaya Tunguska river ‚Äì its confluence with the Baikitik can be found in the former area of the district. The highest point of the district was Onot Mountain at 787 metres.  History  Baykitsky district was created in 1927, three years before the creation of Evenk AO. The district was abolished upon the merger of Evenk AO and Krasnoyarsk Krai, on 1 January 2007. It now forms the south-western area of Evenkiysky District.  Economy   Infrastructure  The district was the centre of industrial development in Evenkia. Within its territory, there were many gas and oil fields, such as Yurubchenko-Tokhomskoye, Kuyumbinskoye and Omorinskoye. The East Siberian Oil Company, the majority of which was formerly owned by Yukos, is currently actively developing the Yurubchenko-Tokhomskoye field. Not far away from the oil field is an oil refinery with a maximum capacity of 40,000 tons of oil per year. The development of the field and refinery put an end to the energy problems in Baykitsky district.  Logging  There is a small timber processing industry in the area. Currently it only produces small volumes of timber ‚Äì only around 10‚Äì15 thousand tons of wood. This figure is planned to be increased in the future, going up to 50,000 or possibly 100,000 tons, so that all of Evenkiysky District can be supplied with wood rather than just the former Baykitsky district, and possibly later supplying other regions.  Reindeer herding  In the past, reindeer herding was well-developed in the area. In just the village of Surinda, there were roughly 15,000 reindeer, and in the village of Poligus, there were up to 10,000. However, in recent years the figure has fallen drastically and the total number of reindeer in the former district has fallen to well under 2,000.  Livestock and other foods  Some people in the settlements of the former district use livestock and gardening as their occupation. As well as this, fishing and hunting are popular activities in the district, all of which made the district relatively self-sufficient in its needs.  Demographics   Settlements  Baykitsky district contained 11 settlements, 2 of which are abandoned (postal codes in brackets): * The town of Baykit (648360) ‚Äì population 3,343 * The village of Burnyy (648367) ‚Äì population 194 * The village of Kuyumba (648373) ‚Äì population 166 * The village of Kuzmovka (648369) ‚Äì population 193 * The village of Miryuga (648365) ‚Äì population 43 * The village of Osharovo (648364) ‚Äì population 96 * The village of Poligus (648371) ‚Äì population 242 * The village of Sulomay (648368) ‚Äì population 178 * The village of Surinda (648372) ‚Äì population 435 * The village of Taimba ‚Äì abandoned since 2016 * The village of Ust-Kamo ‚Äì abandoned since 2016  Population  The population of the town and 9 inhabited settlements of the former district (since 1939) were: * 1939: 3,372 * 1959: 2,843 * 1970: 3,349 * 1979: 4,466 * 1989: 6,939 * 2002: 5,819 * 2010: 5,336  References  Category:Districts of Krasnoyarsk Krai Category:Evenk Autonomous Okrug ","title":"Baykitsky District"},{"id":"57799909","text":"Judicial-Legal Council ‚Äì is an institution of the Republic of Azerbaijan which: * Organizes the judicial system and guarantees judicial independence, * Organizes candidate selection for vacant judge positions, * Evaluates judge's performance, * Provides replacements for vacant positions and decides on promotions, * Arranges disciplinary liability, * Solves other issues related to judges and court's competence ¬∑and * Performs self-governance functions of the judicial power.

All 50 seats in the Parliament will be up for election. Overview Electoral system The Parliament of Navarre is the devolved, unicameral legislature of the Chartered Community of Navarre, having legislative power in regional matters as defined by the Spanish Constitution and the Reintegration and Enhancement of the Foral Regime of Navarre Law, as well as the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a regional president. Voting is on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprises all nationals over eighteen, registered in Navarre and in full enjoyment of their political rights. Additionally, Navarrese abroad are required to apply for voting before being permitted to vote, a system known as \\"begged\\" or expat vote (). The 50 members of the Parliament of Navarre are elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of three percent of valid votes‚Äîwhich includes blank ballots‚Äîbeing applied regionally. Parties not reaching the threshold are not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Election date The term of the Parliament of Navarre expires four years after the date of its previous election, unless it is dissolved earlier. The election decree shall be issued no later than the twenty-fifth day prior to the date of expiry of parliament and published on the following day in the Official Gazette of Navarre (BON), with election day taking place on the fifty-fourth day from publication. The previous election was held on 26 May 2019, which means that the legislature's term will expire on 26 May 2023. The election decree must be published in the BON no later than 2 May 2023, with the election taking place on the fifty-fourth day from publication, setting the latest possible election date for the Parliament on Sunday, 25 June 2023. The president has the prerogative to dissolve the Parliament of Navarre and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence is in process, no nationwide election is due and some time requirements are met: namely, that dissolution does not occur either during the first legislative session or within the legislature's last year ahead of its scheduled expiry, nor before one year has elapsed since a previous dissolution under this procedure. In the event of an investiture process failing to elect a regional president within a three-month period from the election date, the Parliament shall be automatically dissolved and a fresh election called.

The small mouth contains a row of short teeth with hockey-stick shaped tips. The dorsal fin is continuous and has 11 to 14 spines, which can be folded down into a groove, and 11 to 13 soft rays. The anal fin has three spines and 11 to 13 soft rays. The body is clad in small scales which are thick and feel rough. The colour is mainly drab, the belly being paler than the upper parts. M. ancietae can grow to a maximum weight of . Distribution and habitat M. ancietae is native to the subtropical southeastern Pacific Ocean where it is found on the coasts of Peru and Chile. Its habitat is the forests of giant kelp that line the rocky shore subtidally. The dominant species of kelp along this coast are Lessonia trabeculata subtidally and Lessonia nigrescens intertidally; these can grow to a length of and provide a dense tangled environment. Uses Medialuna ancietae is esteemed as a sport fish and is the subject of both recreational and artisanal spear-fishing. Historically, along with Graus nigra and the Chilean sheepshead (Semicossyphus darwini), M. ancietae constituted more than 98% of the fish caught by spear-fishing. However, unregulated fishing has reduced the numbers of these fish to such an extent that by 2015, M. ancietae was rarely seen; the community structure of the kelp forest has been affected by this reduction in the populations of carnivorous fishes.

It was quarried in the 15th century and its southern slope has been used to house beer cellars since 1675. The cellar storage made Erlangen a pioneer concerning beer exports. The \\"Erlangen Bergkirchweih\\" has taken place in and around the cellars every Whitsun since 1775. Geology Strawberry Hill is built up of several layers of the Upper L√∂wenstein Formation. This geological condition was of great practical importance for Erlangen. It can be assumed that since the high Middle Ages, when stones were used to build houses, quarries were created at Burgberg. The earliest evidence of this dates back to 1619. For the construction of the new town \\"Christian- Erlang\\" (from 1686) and the reconstruction of the old town after the big city fire (from 1706) mainly stones from the castle hill were used. The extraction of stone from the castle hill experienced a last upswing from the middle of the 19th century, when numerous university buildings were newly built and the town expanded in the course of the Gr√ºnderzeit. At the beginning of the 20th century the stone exploitation ended. Today, 31 quarries can still be found. Particularly in the western part of the mountain, some are clearly visible. The cellars of the Erlangen breweries The Henninger Cellar during the Erlanger Bergkirchweih, 2009 The Burgberg gained further importance for the town when in the last decades of the 17th century the Erlangen brewers began to drive cellars into the mountain's southern side. Over the course of the next 150 years 16 rock cellars were built, which still today form a labyrinth more than 21 km in length. The Henninger cellar leads 861 metres through the entire mountain to the north side. The cellars provide optimal conditions for the year-round storage of beer, which used to be brewed only in winter. This cellar system enabled the Erlangen brewers to supply fresh beer all year round, making Erlangen one of the leading beer export cities in Germany, especially in the 19th century. The Erlangen brewers only lost this advantage with the invention of the refrigerating machine by Linde. This led to the decline of the Erlangen brewing industry. While individual cellars were still used for mushroom cultivation in the middle of the 20th century, they were no longer used for beer storage. In 1729 the Erlangen shooting company built the old town shooting gallery on the southern slope. In 1755 the magistrate of Erlangen's old town decided to move the traditional Pentecost market to the cellars on the castle hill. This custom was retained from then on, this Pentecost market developed into the Erlanger Bergkirchweih, today one of the largest Bavarian beer festivals. The Zum Burgkeller inn also existed on the south-western slope from 1856 to 1876. It was demolished in 1936 when the B4 was moved. Further below was the restaurant Zur Windm√ºhle, whose building today serves as a residential building and is located directly next to the A 73. Resort and villa district of the Erlangen Society One of the small two storey houses, September 2006 In addition to the Bergkirchweih, the Altst√§dter shooting gallery and the beer cellars, other popular excursion destinations developed on the castle hill in the 18th and 19th century, and became meeting places for local society. Professors and dignitaries of the city erected small sheds in their gardens, some with fountains and staircases, such as the two- storey houses on the north side of Strawberry Hill. In the forest area of the Solitude, located on the north-west slope of the hill, above the Jewish cemetery, many romanticists from Erlangen enjoyed nature in the 19th century. A well-known attraction was the spring at the Solitude, above the Rudelsweiher pond, which was already in Bubenreuth territory, from where people enjoyed hiking to the inns and the observation tower on the Rathsberg. The area of the Solitude is also known as the Eisgrube (ice pit). In winter, when the ice cover of the ponds was at least 30 cm thick, a larger plate was cut out, pulled to the shore and cut into customary blocks, e.g. 60 √ó 20 √ó 110 cm. The ice blocks were taken to the former quarries (ice pits) in this shady and humid forest area and bought by the breweries. Stacked in rock cellars, the ice remained in place until next autumn. Some beer cellars also crossed the Burgberg in the past and were able to import the ice directly. In 1928 the Corps Guestphalia \\"An den Kellern 45\\" inaugurated the new Corps House, which stands on the site of the Birkners Cellar and is still a meeting place for many students during the Bergkirchweih. Directly east of the Burgberg garden, the imperial postmaster Ruprecht Wels established a terraced restaurant and amusement park, the so-called Welsgarten, in 1770. The Erlangen Burschenschaft was founded there on 1 December 1817. A commemorative plaque on the lowest terrace wall commemorates this event. The garden was parcelled out at the beginning of the 20th century and built with villas. One of these villas is now the seat of the Erlangen Music Institute. Even today, the castle hill is still the first address of the city and is built with villas and spacious single-family houses.

Deshgah means mugham's sophistication, its sequence, all sections and parts, as well as the sequence of tasnif and color. The sections included in the Mugham composition are composed of improvised receptive styled vocal tunes that determine the musical-poetic content of the work. They are replaced by song and dance episodes with a precise rhythm. Song episodes are called ‚Äútasnif‚Äù and dance is called ‚Äúcolor‚Äù. In the early stage the sazende group was used in the triads: tar, kamancheh and balaban (balm), tasnif and color were used in the circle and naqareh. After reconstruction of the tar by the famous tar player Sadigjan, there is no need to use naqareh, which is replaced by the fine-tune daf. Thus, this group consists of only 3 people. This group includes the tarzen, kamancheh player and khanende that have been functioning since the second half of the 19th century. They play an important role in the development of Azerbaijani folk music and the creation of mugham performing school. The main performer of the trio group is the singer ‚Äì khanende who performs with daf. He builds a composition based on his own taste and ability. More precisely, khanende decides which sections to include in which subdivisions, also to incorporate the content, color, or tasnif. The Khanende brings the daf closer to the pile as he sings mugham, and ensures that his voice is focused on the listeners. During the performance of tasnif and color, he accompanies his partners and himself. The second participant of the trio group is the tarzen and the musical instrument is tar. While the knanende is singing, he accompanies him with organ, plays the interactive solo mugham, and modulates the new episodes. The execution of the desgah is a kind of dialogue with the tarzen. Firstly, the tar plays some parts instrumentally and then replaces its place with khanende. Tarzen is the only soloist in the instrumental plays which switch with mugham sections. The tarzen should have the ensemble sense and must not only accompany the khanande but also should know when to give him to have a breath and feel his individual opportunities in a sensitive way. The tarzen should have the ensemble sense and must not only accompany the khanande but also should know when he let the khanande pause and should feel his individual opportunities in a sensitive way. The last part of the group - kamancheh‚Äôs function (bowed string instrument) is limited. At the same time, the kamancheh player accompanying the khanende and tarzen also helps to express the style of expression of mugham. Additionally, imitation of the tar with the khanende, the kamancheh with the tar, create a complex expression in the musical language called double imitation. But the kamancheh is not an accomplice only. After the dramatic episodes of the khanende in the lyrical, mournful episodes of mugham, the kamancheh's solos are expressive.  Use of musical instruments   Daf  Daf is a punched instrument. The daf is a round wood ring, one side is covered with fish skin. Small circular rings are mounted inside a circular, wide 60‚Äì75 mm and 350‚Äì450 mm in diameter, and they snooze while performance. Mugham is widely used in performances. It's a kind of attribute of khanende. Thus, the khanende takes part in the performance of the full-length rhythmic music episodes of triads with playing in daf. Therefore, the daf has become a kind of khanende's attribute.  Tar  Tar is a string musical instrument played with mizrab. The Azerbaijani tar is used in the mugham triads has its own structure, design and artistic and technical capabilities.  Kamancheh  Kamancheh is the only string musical instrument among Azerbaijani folk instruments. It is one of the oldest musical instruments in Azerbaijan. It is depicted in Nizami Ganjavi's poem \\"Khosrov and Shirin\\" and depicted in Tabriz miniature paintings (Aghamirek Isfahani, Mir Seyid Ali). Kamancheh is mainly made of walnut. In some films, mugham triads have been mentioned. For example, in the 1956 Azerbaijani film, \\"O olmasƒ±n, bu olsun\\" (It Does not matter) it was a trio of Khan Shushinski, Bahram Mansurov and Talat Bakikhanov. On February 17, 2014, the picture of the mugham triads is used on the Azerbaijani philately product released by Azermarka. The part of the picture with daf is separately released as a stamp. The musical instruments of the mugham triads were depicted on 1 manat of Azerbaijan issued by the Central Bank of Azerbaijan in 2005 and 2009 and 1 coin of Azerbaijan issued in 2006.

Located approximately 370 light-years from Earth, it has a mass of , and is approximately 10 million years old. The star has a protoplanetary disk containing two nascent exoplanets, named PDS 70b and PDS 70c, which have been directly imaged by the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope. PDS 70b was the first confirmed protoplanet to be directly imaged. Protoplanetary disk Circumplanetary disk around exoplanet PDS 70c The protoplanetary disk around PDS 70 was first hypothesized in 1992 and confirmed in 2006 along with a jet-like structure. The disk has a radius of approximately . In 2012 a large gap (~) in the disk was discovered, which was thought to be caused by planetary formation. The gap was later found to have multiple regions: large dust grains were absent out to 80 au, while small dust grains were only absent out to the previously-observed . There is an asymmetry in the overall shape of the gap; these factors indicate that there are likely multiple planets affecting the shape of the gap and the dust distribution. Planetary system In results published in 2018, a planet in the disk, named PDS 70b, was imaged by the Very Large Telescope (VLT). With a mass estimated to be a few times greater than Jupiter, the planet was thought to have a temperature of around and an atmosphere with clouds; its orbit has an approximate radius of , taking around 120 years for a revolution. Modelling predicts that the planet has acquired its own accretion disk. The accretion disk was observationally confirmed in 2019, and accretion rate was measured to be at least 5*10‚àí7 Jupiter masses per year, which is equivalent to about 1/80 the mass of the Moon. The optically thick accretion disk radius is 3.0 , significantly larger than planet itself. Its bolometric temperature is 1193 K. A second planet, named PDS 70c, was discovered in 2019 using the VLT's MUSE integral field spectrograph. The planet orbits its host star at a distance of , further away than PDS 70b. PDS 70c is in a near 1:2 orbital resonance with PDS 70b, meaning that PDS 70c completes nearly one revolution once every time PDS 70b completes nearly two. Circumplanetary disk In July 2019 astronomers using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) reported the first-ever detection of a moon-forming circumplanetary disk. The disk was detected around PDS 70c, with a potential disk observed around PDS 70b. The disk was confirmed by Caltech-led researchers using the W. M. Keck Observatory in Mauna Kea, whose research was published in May 2020.

He who holds the teaching chair at the University of G√∂ttingen in criminal law, criminal procedure, comparative law and international criminal law. He served as a judge at the District Court for Lower Saxony between 2006 and 2017. In February 2017 he was appointed to serve as a judge on the Special Tribunal for Kosovo (officially \\"Kosovo Relocated Specialist Judicial Institution\\") at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. He has authored and edited numerous publications on criminal law and procedure in Germany and internationally. In 2011 he argued that the killing of Osama bin Laden was \\"both illegal and morally dubious\\".  Biography  Kai Ambos was born in Heidelberg. He studied Law and Political sciences at Freiburg i.B., Oxford and Munich, where he passed his Level I law exams in 1990. His doctorate, also received from Munich University, and supervised by Horst Sch√ºler-Springorum , followed just two years later. His dissertation, subsequently published under the auspices of the Max Planck Institute, concerned problems of drug control in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. On 27 October 1997 he received the \\"Law and Development Prize\\" from the \\"Herbert Kr√ºger foundation for overseas constitutional comparison\\" for it. Meanwhile, he passed his Level II law exams in 1994. After that he worked as an academic research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for foreign and international criminal law and as an academic research assistant at Freiburg University under the direction of Prof. Dr. Albin Eser, with whom he has subsequently collaborated on a succession of academic projects. In 2001 his habilitation (like his doctorate) was awarded by Munich University. It was supervised by Profs. Klaus Volk and Simma, and addressed \\"General aspects of International criminal law\\" (\\"Allgemeinen Teil des V√∂lkerstrafrechts\\"). It was subsequently published. The habilitation cleared the way for a lifelong career in the universities sector and he accepted a teaching chair at the University of Freiburg. That appointment was a relatively brief one, however, since at the start of 2003 he moved to G√∂ttingen where he continues (in 2018) to occupy the teaching chair in criminal law, criminal procedure, comparative law and international criminal law. Kai Ambos served as a judge in the district court in G√∂ttingen for more than ten years, his appointment taking effect on 24 March 2006. Beyond the academic world, he came to national and international attention as a member of the defence team for Mladen Markaƒç at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the case of \\"Gorovina and others\\". More than ten years after the official indictment, on 16 November 2012, the case ended, on appeal, with an acquittal for Markaƒç and his co-defendants, by a majority verdict of the panel judges. The outcome gave rise to much media discussion: Ambos himself admitted that he had been very much surprised by the eleventh hour acquittal. In 2013 Ambos received an honorary doctorate from the Universidad Nacional de la Amazon√≠a Peruana in northern Peru for \\"services to criminal justice and criminal process and his commitment to reform of the justice systems in Peru and other Latin American countries\\". In January 2014 a \\"Research Centre for Latina American criminal law and criminal procedure\\" (\\"Centro de Estudios de Derecho Penal y Procesal Penal Latinoamericano\\" / CEDPAL) was inaugurated at G√∂ttingen under the auspices of Ambos' professorship. He serves currently as its \\"Director General\\". The research centre is supported by its own academic advisory council and a specialist library containing more than 12,000 titles. On 7 February 2017 Ambos was appointed to serve as a judge on the Special Tribunal for Kosovo (officially \\"Kosovo Relocated Specialist Judicial Institution\\") at the International Court of Justice in The Hague.  More opinions  In 2012 Kai Ambos argued that the \\"misuse\\" by the Ecuadorian government of its London embassy to protect Julian Assange from prosecution in Sweden in respect of rape charges was a breach of human rights. Pointing out that Assange had been able to arrange matters so that it had taken three English courts a year and a half to reach the point at which they were about to extradite Assange, Ambos went on to highlight ways in which the parties had been able to politicise the affair, and he set out ways in which the case highlighted that in practice the European Arrest Warrant system was being implemented very much more robustly in some member states than in others. In 2015 he addressed the matter of the so-called Armenian Genocide. Setting aside the continuing heated debates over whether the term was \\"politically correct\\", he invited consideration of whether it was \\"legally correct\\", pointing out that the necessity to prove \\"destructive intent\\" (\\"Zerst√∂rungsabsicht\\") on the part of the Ottoman government presented formidable challenges.

Measurement Incorporated currently administers state-wide standardized tests for Arizona, California, Michigan, and Washington State. Measurement Incorporated also administers the Independent School Entrance Examination (ISEE) for the Educational Records Bureau.  Products and Services  Measurement Incorporated (MI) provides assessment services, automated essay scoring products, online testing and development, and professional services. MI also provides traditional paper and pencil assessments. Corporate Affairs Historic Preservation Measurement Incorporated has purchased and renovated three historic buildings in downtown Durham, North Carolina: the Brodie Duke Warehouse, the Imperial Tobacco Warehouse, and the BC Remedy Building. Built around 1878, the Brodie Duke Warehouse is one of the oldest tobacco-related buildings in town. Brodie Duke was the oldest surviving child of Washington Duke, and was the first of the Duke family to move to Durham. He made a living by selling tobacco from the floor below his living space. After a while, the rest of Brodie's family followed in his footsteps, selling their farm and moving to Durham. Brodie and his father shared a warehouse at this time, and held an agreement by which each would sell the other's products. Eventually, Brodie built his own warehouse, the Brodie Duke Warehouse, and joined with his family to create W. Duke, Sons & Co. The Imperial Tobacco Warehouse was built during the 1890s, and was originally owned and used by the Imperial Tobacco Company. In retaliation against James Buchanan Duke's expansion of the American Tobacco Company into Europe, the lead European tobacco companies combined to create the Imperial Tobacco Company, and expand to the United States' market. For a while, the two companies had a deal, by which neither would enter each other's market. However, in attempt to lower their prices in Europe, the Imperial Tobacco Company established their own organization in the United States. In 1965, the building was sold to the DC May decorating company, and in 1987, it was leased to the film crew of Bull Durham, starring Kevin Costner and Susan Sarandon. In 2005, it was sold to, and renovated by, MI. The BC Remedy Building was formerly owned by Five Points Drug Company. Built in the early 1920s, it was used to produce BC Powder, an over-the-counter pain reliever, commonly used for headaches, that contains aspirin and caffeine. In the 1970s, the building was used as an operations center for Central Carolina Bank and Trust, and was later sold to MI, who renovated it into an office space. Criticism and Controversies Testing problems In 2005, about 890 Ohio high school students thought they had failed a test, when they had actually passed. A scoring error was made by MI on the ISEE admission test for the 2010/2011 testing year, about 7000 (or 17%) of the testing students received incorrect scores because the wrong key had been used. In 2016, the state of Michigan fined the company $400,000 for not delivering test scores on time. TNReady lawsuit In 2016, the state of Tennessee terminated two contracts, worth a total of $165 million with the company after the failure of their online testing platform followed by a failure to deliver paper versions of the tests. In June 2017, Measurement Incorporated sued the State of Tennessee Department of Education for $25.3 million. The Department of Education responded in January 2018 with a counterclaim, saying the company did not fulfill its duties. The case is currently pending with the Tennessee Claims Commission and is slated to go to trial in late 2019. Religious discrimination In 2011, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) fined Measurement Incorporated $110,000 for discriminating against Jacqueline Dukes when she was fired for refusing to work on her Sabbath (EEOC v.

Then the Legendre transform of \\\\Lambda : : \\\\Lambda^*(x):= \\\\sup_{t \\\\in \\\\mathbb R} \\\\left(tx-\\\\Lambda(t) \\\\right) satisfies, : \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac 1n \\\\log \\\\left(P\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \\\\geq nx \\\\right)\\\\right) = -\\\\Lambda^*(x) for all x > \\\\operatorname E[X_1]. In the terminology of the theory of large deviations the result can be reformulated as follows: If X_1, X_2, \\\\dots is a series of iid random variables, then the distributions \\\\left(\\\\mathcal L ( \\\\tfrac 1n \\\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i) \\\\right)_{n \\\\in \\\\N} satisfy a large deviation principle with rate function \\\\Lambda^* .

It was composed by Tirso Cruz, with lyrics by James King Steele. History Tirso Cruz penned the melody to \\"We Say Mabuhay\\", with lyrics by James King Steele, sometime during the 1930s. Various dates have been attributed to the original composition of \\"We Say Mabuhay\\" ranging from 1931 to 1940. According to The Philippine Star, however, it was first performed May 16, 1931 at the Manila Hotel. During World War II, U.S. government broadcasters used the melody of the song for their radio program The Philippine Hour, which was transmitted from relay stations in Australia and San Francisco to the Japanese-occupied archipelago. The lyrics and music to the song were also printed in a 1945 issue of the U.S. Army propaganda leaflet Free Philippines, which was covertly distributed in the country. In that version of the song, the original lyrics \\"under our blue sky\\" were substituted with \\"under the blue sky\\", a version that has remained as the one most commonly used in the Philippines since. As the honors music for the President of the Philippines, \\"We Say Mabuhay\\" is traditionally performed at the Philippine presidential inauguration following the oath of office of the incoming president, as well as at other times during the entrance or approach of a sitting President of the Philippines. In keeping with the American custom, it is traditionally preceded by four ruffles and flourishes. The word \\"Mabuhay\\", which forms part of the song's title and features prominently in its lyrics, is a Tagalog greeting meaning \\"long live\\". \\"We Say Mabuhay\\" (sample) Lyrics: :We say Mabuhay! :We say Mabuhay! :Under the blue skies, :Where our friends sit by! :A greeting of farewell! :A toast that will wear well! :We raise our voices and say Mabuhay! Composer and lyricist Tirso Cruz was a prominent Filipino bandmaster in the 1930s and 1940s who helped popularize jazz in the Philippines. He is remembered for his longtime leadership of the Mabuhay Orchestra, the house band at the Manila Hotel. James King Steele was an American public relations executive who, during the 1930s, was retained to promote tourism to the Philippines and would later fill a similar role for Nevadans Unlimited, a tourism trade group in the United States state of Nevada.

As a juvenile in 1889 he was regarded as the best colt of his generation in England after winning three of his four races including the Woodcote Stakes and New Stakes. He also demonstrated his precocity by reportedly siring a foal as a two-year-old. In 1890 he was an emphatic winner of the 2000 Guineas but despite being regarded as a near certainty for the Epsom Derby he finished fourth after spending much of the race attempting to savage other horses and jockeys. He went on to win a minor race at Royal Ascot and later defeated a strong field to take the valuable Prince of Wales' Stakes at Leicester Racecourse. As a four-year-old he showed little worthwhile form early in the season but returned to his best to win the Eclipse Stakes. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in England and France but had limited success as a sire of winners. Background Surefoot was a \\"big, perfectly-formed\\" bay horse bred in England by his owner Mr A. W. \\"Archie\\" Merry, the son of James Merry. The colt was sent into training with Charles Jousiffe at Seven Barrows near Lambourn in Berkshire, where he was assigned to the box previously occupied by Bendigo. He was ridden in almost all of his races by the Edinburgh-born jockey John Liddiard. His sire Wisdom, who died in 1893, was a failure as a racehorse but became a highly successful stallion, siring good horses such as Sir Hugo, Love Wisely (Ascot Gold Cup) and La Sagesse. Surefoot's dam, an unnamed mare by Galopin, was a granddaughter of the influential British broodmare Gossamer (foaled 1849). Racing career 1889: two-year-old season In 1888, the English sportsman Sir John Willoughby opened a book on the 1890 Epsom Derby and accepted a bet ¬£100 on Surefoot at odds of 100/1 meaning that he stood to lose ¬£10,000 if the colt won the race. Surefoot recorded his first significant success on his racecourse debut in the Woodcote Stakes at the Derby meeting at Epsom Racecourse when he won by half a length from Heresy. At Royal Ascot in June he sustained his only defeat of the season in the Biennial Stakes when he was beaten a head after a \\"desperate\\" struggle with the filly Semolina. In the New Stakes two days later at the same meeting he was ridden by John Liddiard and won \\"easily\\" by a length from Heaume at odds of 5/4, After the race he was backed at odds of 6/1 for the following year's Epsom Derby. In the Findon Stakes over six furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse on 2 August Surefoot started at odds of 6/100 against two opponents and won \\"in a canter\\" by three lengths from the filly Red Thorn. Despite failing to reappear after his Goodwood victory, Surefoot ended the year with earnings of ¬£2,411 and headed the Derby betting on 4/1 with his nearest rivals being Le Nord (Dewhurst Stakes), Heaume (Challenge Stakes) and the filly Riviera (Champagne Stakes). He was described as the best two-year-old colt of the year although some doubts were expressed about his temperament and ability to withstand hard training. It was later reported that at some point in 1889, Surefoot had broken his way into a paddock containing several broodmares and that at least one foal was born as a result of his escapade. 1890: three-year-old season =Spring= Early in 1890 a visitor to Seven Barrows described the colt as \\"gross in constitution... lusty... clean in the pipes... [with] extraordinary muscular development\\" and \\"nearly the finest three-year-old I have ever looked over\\". Surefoot began his second campaign when he was one of nine colts to contest the 82nd running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket on 30 April. With Liddiard again in the saddle he was made the 5/4 favourite ahead of Le Nord (15/8) while the only other runners to start at less than 20/1 were the Duke of Portland's St Serf and the Duke of Westminster's Blue Green. Presumably on account of his nervous disposition he was saddled at the start rather than taking part in the mounted parade in front of the stands. Surefoot led from the start under strong restraint before Liddiard allowed him to stride out a furlong from the finish. He \\"romped\\" away from his opponents and won in the \\"easiest possible\\" style by a length and a half from Le Nord with five length back to Blue Green in third. After the race he still appeared full of energy and looked as though he had merely completed an exercise canter. =Summer= On 4 June at Epsom Racecourse Surefoot started the 40/95 favourite for the Derby Stakes with the best-fancied of his seven opponents being the John Porter-trained Sainfoin. The journey from Lambourn to Epsom had not been an easy one, with Surefoot's behaviour in the horsebox being likened to that of a Murcian Bull. When the contest began he raced in mid-division for most of the way in a slowly-run race and turned into the straight in fourth place. He made some progress under strong driving in the last quarter mile but became the shortest-priced beaten favourite in the race's history as he came home fourth behind Sainfoin, Le Nord and Orwell, beaten about a length by the winner. Surefoot had not improved his chances by his \\"demoniacal temper\\" and aggressive behaviour as he seemed more intent on attacking other horses than winning the race and at one point Liddiard had great difficulty preventing the colt from biting one of the other jockeys. After the race Archie Merry was seen \\"gesticulating wildly\\" at a visibly distressed Liddiard. Although there was some criticism of Liddiard for not taking the colt to front early in the race, other observers pointed out that Surefoot refused to co-operate with his jockey and blamed the owner and trainer for mollycoddling and \\"pampering\\" the horse, thus rendering him temperamentally ill-prepared for the occasion. Surefoot ran three times at Royal Ascot later in June. He was equipped with blinkers for the Prince of Wales's Stakes over thirteen furlongs and started 5/4 favourite but after leading for most of the way he faded in the straight and finished fourth behind Alloway, Blue Green and Hebrides. On the following afternoon he won a Biennial Stakes over one mile against very moderate opposition. On the final day of the meeting two days later he faced a rematch with Sainfoin in the Hardwicke Stakes but neither proved any match for the four-year-old Amphion who won easily by a length from the Derby winner with Surefoot four lengths back in third. On 9 July the colt was dropped back in distance for the ¬£8,500 Prince of Wales Stakes over one mile at Leicester Racecourse and was made the 5/2 favourite in an eight-runner field which also included Memoir (winner of the Epsom Oaks), Oddfellow (third in the Grand Prix de Paris), Le Nord and Alloway. Despite showing his customary bad temper at the start, where he refused to line up with the other horses, Surefoot quickly took the lead and opened up a clear advantage. Memoir emerged as his only threat in the closing stages, but he shook off the filly's challenge and drew away to win by two lengths with a gap of five lengths back to Alloway in third. =Autumn= At Doncaster Racecourse on 10 September Surefoot was stepped up in distance for the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs and started the 8/1 fourth choice in the betting. He was restrained towards the rear of the fifteen runner field but lost any chance of winning when he was struck into from behind by St Serf and finished tenth behind Memoir. Surefoot ended his season in the Free Handicap over ten furlongs at Newmarket in October in which he carried joint top weight of 131 pounds and finished fourth behind St Serf (120 pounds), Martagon (106) and Blue Green (120) with Sainfoin (131) in fifth and last place Surefoot ended the year with earnings of ¬£12,722. 1891: four-year-old season Charles Jousiffe, who had been suffering from heart problem for several years, died in early 1891, and the training of Surefoot was taken over by Garrett Moore. The colt began his third campaign in the Great Jubilee Handicap over one mile at Kempton Park Racecourse on 9 May in which he carried top weight of 131pounds and started the 100/30 favourite. He finished unplaced behind the five-year-old Nunthorpe with his rapid retreat in the last three furlongs being ascribed to either \\"inability or bad temper\\". At Royal Ascot he was dropped back to sprint distances for the Queen's Stand Plate and finished down the field behind the two-year-old filly Lady Caroline. At Sandown Park on 9 July, Surefoot, carrying 142 pounds, started at odds of 100/8 for the fourth running of the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs. The Derby winner Common started the odds-on favourite while the other seven runners included Memoir, Gouverneur (runner-up in the Derby), Le Nord and Alloway. Surefoot misbehaved as usual before and after the race, rearing up and \\"scattering the crowd in all directions\\". In the race he settled behind the leaders before moving up on the outside in the straight. A furlong out Common and Gouverneur were locked together and fighting out the finish when Liddiard unleashed Surefoot who produced a powerful late run. The older horse gained the advantage in the final strides and won by half a length and a short head from Gouverneur and Common. After Surefoot's victory it was reported that Merry intended to retire the horse to stud before his temper was \\"irretrievably ruined\\". Stud record At the end of his racing career, Surefoot was retired to become a breeding stallion. In 1899 he was sold to Pierre d'Arenberg and exported to France, where he died in 1904. The best of his offspring was probably Pinfold, a gelding who won the Doncaster Cup as a three-year-old in 1898.

Serious studies of the Korean megalithic monuments were not undertaken until relatively recently, well after much research had already been conducted on dolmens in other regions of the world. Since 1945, new research has been conducted by Korean scholars. In 1981 a curator of National Museum of Korea, Gon'gil Ji, classified Korean dolmens into two general types: northern and southern. The boundary between them falls at the Bukhan River although examples of both types are found on either side. Northern style dolmens stand above ground with a four sided chamber and a megalithic roof (also referred to as \\"table type\\"), while southern style dolmens are normally built into the ground and contain a stone chest or pit covered by a rock slab. Korean dolmens can also be divided into three main types: the table type, the go-table type and the unsupported capstone type. The dolmen in Ganghwa is a northern-type, table-shaped dolmen and is the biggest stone of this kind in South Korea, measuring . There are many sub-types and different styles.Megalithic Cultures in Asia, Kim Byung-mo, 1982, Hanyang University Press Southern type dolmens are associated with burials but the reason for building northern style dolmens is uncertain. Due to the vast numbers and great variation in styles, no absolute chronology of Korean dolmens has yet been established. It is generally accepted that the Korean megalithic culture emerged from the late Neolithic age, during which agriculture developed on the peninsula, and flourished throughout the Bronze Age. Some dolmens depict astronomical formations, dated up to 3000 B.C. effectively the first star- chart in the world. How and why Korea has produced so many dolmens are still poorly understood. There is no current conclusive theory on the origin of Korea's megalithic culture, and so it is difficult to determine the true cultural character of Korean dolmens. Some dolmens are also found in Manchuria and the Shandong Peninsula. Off the peninsula, similar specimens can be found in smaller numbers, but they are often considerably larger than the Korean dolmens.Joussaume, Roger Dolmens for the Dead Batsford Ltd (Jan 1988) p. 280 It is a mystery why this culture flourished so extensively only on the Korean peninsula and its vicinity in Northeast Asia. = India = * Telangana: In Telangana dolmen graves are identified near Thatikonda, Jangaon district by Historical Researcher Reddy Ratnakar Reddy. And in past the archaeology department found the megalithic dolmens at Tadwai Forest, Eturnagaram Forest in Bhupalpally Dist, And coming to Warangal Urban dist we can find one dolmen in dharmasar Hillock beside Dharmasagar reservoir. * Kerala: There are dozens of dolmens belonging to the Stone Age and Iron Age, found in Marayur, Kerala. * Andhra Pradesh: In Andhra Pradesh there is an evidence of dolmens existence in Amadalavalasa Town, Megalithic Dolmen (said to be world's large single capstone as a dolmen with 36 ft in length and 14 ft in width and 2 ft thickness) of early Iron Age at Dannanapeta near Amadalavalasa Town. * Karnataka: In Karnataka more than 50 dolmens are identified on top of Pandavara Betta about away from Somwarpet towards Shaniwar Sante in Madikeri (Coorg) District. * Tamil Nadu: In Tamil Nadu more than 100 dolmens are identified in the Moral Pari near Mallachandram located from Krishnagiri district, Tamil Nadu. = Caucasus = Over 3,000 dolmens and other structures can be found in the North-Western Caucasus region in Russia, where more and more dolmens are discovered in the mountains each year. These dolmens are related to the Maykop culture. This great city of dolmens was built along the shores of the Black Sea from Maykop down to Sochi. The inhabitants were metal workers. The dolmens were vaults or safes of stone, with a narrow circular entrance that could be tapped with a round screw of stone. Supposedly the dolmens were used to hide and protect metal objects: gold, silver, bronze, jewels and some other treasure. Trade of these objects was done with Persia, Assyria, Egypt and Crete. The Dolmen City was pillaged and sacked by Scythian invaders in the early first millennium BC. The metal workers were enslaved. =China= A large group of dolmens along the Huifa River in Jilin Province were listed as a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level in 2006. The dolmens have been dated to the fifth century BCE and total more than 80. They are linked to similar monuments found on the Korean Peninsula and the Liao River basin. = Middle East = Flint dolmen in Johfiyeh, Jordan Dolmens can be found in Israel, Syria, Iran and Jordan. Numerous large dolmens are in the Israeli National park at Gamla and some of dolmens can be viewed in the meshkin shahr at shahr yeri or pirazmian.Oldest archaeological org in Israel: http://www.hadashot- esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id=1164&mag;_id=115 There are many examples of flint dolmens in the historical villages of Johfiyeh and Natifah in northern Jordan. The greatest number of dolmens are around Madaba, like the ones at Al Faiha village, to the west of Madaba city. Two dolmens are in Hisbone, and the most have been found at Zarqa Ma'in at Al-Murayghat, which are being destroyed by gravel quarries.  Africa  = Horn of Africa = In northern Somalia, the town of Aw Barkhadle is surrounded by a number of ancient structures. Among these are dolmens, burial mounds, menhirs (standing stones), and stelae. = North Africa = Dolmen at Roknia, an ancient necropolis in the Guelma region of northeast Algeria; the site includes more than 7000 dolmens spread over an area of In northern Tunisia, Dougga is an important ancient site, which contains a necropolis with dolmens. The settlement also features a sanctuary dedicated to Ba'al Hammon, neo-Punic stelae, the mausoleum, architectural fragments, and a temple dedicated to Masinissa, the remains of which were found during archaeological excavations.  Europe  = Overview = Megalithic tombs are found from the Mediterranean Sea, Baltic Sea and North Sea coasts south to Spain and Portugal. Hunebedden are chamber tombs similar to dolmens and date to the middle Neolithic (Funnelbeaker culture, 4th millennium BC). They consist of a kerb surrounding an oval mound, which covered a rectangular chamber of stones with the entrance on one of the long sides. Some have a more complex layout and include an entrance passage giving them a T-shape. Various menhirs and dolmens are located around the Mediterranean islands of Malta and Gozo. Pottery uncovered in these structures allowed the attribution of the monuments to the ƒ†gantija and Mnajdra temples culture of the early Neolithic Age.Journal of European Archaeology (JEA), 5 (1997); Emilia P√°sztor and Curt Roslund: Orientation of Maltese dolmens. Dolmen sites fringe the Irish Sea and are found in south-east Ireland, Wales, Devon and Cornwall. In Ireland, most dolmens are found on the west coast, particularly in Connemara and the Burren, which includes some of the better-known examples, such as Poulnabrone dolmen. Examples such as the Annadorn dolmen have also been found in Northern Ireland, where they may have co-existed with the court cairn tombs. In Mecklenburg and Pomerania/Pomorze in Germany and Poland, and in Drenthe in the Netherlands, large numbers of these graves were disturbed when harbours, towns, and cities were built. The boulders were used in construction and road building. Others, such as the Harhoog, in Sylt, were moved to new locations. There are still many thousands left today in Europe. By 2017, all the hunebedden in the Netherlands were put in a 3D atlas (accessible to the public for free) using photogrammetry. The data was obtained from a collaboration between the Province of Drenthe and the University of Groningen, subsidized by the Gratama Foundation. In Turkey, there are some dolmens in the Regions of Lalapasa and Suloglu in the Province of Edirne and the Regions of Kof√ßaz, Kƒ±rklareli and Demirk√∂y in the Province of Kƒ±rklareli, in the Eastern Thrace. They have been studied by Prof. Dr. Engin Beksa√ß, since 2004. And also, some of so-called monuments are in the different regions of Anatolia, in Turkey. = Sites = * Bulgaria: There are interesting dolmens in the regions related to the Sakar and Rhodope and Strandzha Mountains in Bulgaria. There is also a dolmen in Hor√´-Vranisht, Albania. It is locally known as \\"Guri me qiell\\" (\\"Stone in the sky\\") or \\"Sofra e Zotit\\" (\\"Table of the God\\"). * Channel Islands: Many examples appear on the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey, such as D√©hus Dolmen, La Pouquelaye de Faldouet, La Sergent√©, and La Hougue des G√©onnais. The term Houge derives from the Old Norse word haugr, meaning a mound or barrow. The most famous of these sites is La Hougue Bie, a 6,000-year-old neolithic site that sits inside a large mound; later a chapel was built on the top of the mound. * France: In France important megalithic zones are situated in Vend√©e, Quercy and in the south of France (Languedoc, Rouergue and Corsica). Amongst the vast Neolithic collections of the Carnac stones in Brittany, several dozen dolmens are found. Across the country, several dolmens still stand, such as the ones of Passebonneau and des Gorces near Saint- Beno√Æt-du-Sault. * Ireland: The largest dolmen in Europe is the Brownshill Dolmen in County Carlow, Ireland. Its capstone weighs about 150 tonnes. Dolmen located in Monte Bubbonia (Sicily) Pseudo-Dolmen of Avola (Syracuse district), Sicily * Italy: In Italy dolmens can be found in Apulia, Sardinia and in Sicily. In this latter region there are small dolmens located in Mura Pregne (Palermo), Sciacca (Agrigento), Monte Bubbonia (Caltanissetta), Butera (Caltanissetta), Cava dei Servi (Ragusa), Cava Lazzaro (Siracusa), Avola (Siracusa).Salvatore Piccolo, Ancient Stones, op. cit. In the area named Cava dei Servi was found an atypical dolmen, away from the trilithic characteristic shape; it's a semi-oval monument formed by four rectangular slabs fixed into the ground. Another three slabs are on top, leaning in such a way they reduce the surface and form a false dome; two large parallelepiped boulders complete the construction.Salvatore Piccolo, ibidem, pages 13 onwards. * The Netherlands: 54 dolmens are found in the country's Northeast, 52 of them in the province of Drenthe and 2 in the adjacent province of Groningen. Dolmens D7 and D8 are protected by the Strubben-Kniphorstbos archaeological reserve. * Portugal: Dolmens can be found across Portugal, ranging from simple ones to more complex examples of megalithic architecture, such as the Almendres Cromlech or the Anta Grande do Zambujeiro. * Spain: In Spain dolmens can be found in Galicia (such as Axeitos), Basque Country and Navarre (like the Sorgin Etxea) and the basque name for them is Trikuharri or Jentiletxe, Catalonia (like Cova d'en Daina or Creu d'en Cobertella), Andalusia (like the Cueva de Menga) and Extremadura (like \\"Dolmen de L√°cara\\"). * United Kingdom: There are many dolmens in the United Kingdom, such as Pentre Ifan, Tinkinswood, and St Lythans burial chamber in Wales, Spinsters' Rock and Dartmoor kistvaens in Devon, and Lanyon Quoit in Cornwall.

Although less popular than it once was, it is still played in Austria, especially in Carinthia, and, in 2013, it was one of five variants of Tarock game competed for in the International Piatnik Tarock Tournament (Internationales Piatnik- Tarockturnier) in Vienna.Internationales Piatnik-Tarockturnier Wien, 19. J√§nner 2013 at tarockoesterreich.jimdo.com. Retrieve 30 Jun 2018. For a long time, three-handed variants of Tarock were played alongside the four-handed games and were very popular everywhere in Austria. They have since fallen behind in popularity which \\"is a pity because they are interesting variants which demand a high level of skill\\".  Aim  As the declarer, to score 36 points out of a total of 70 while maximising the game and bonus points. As the two defenders to prevent the declarer winning, while also seeking to earn bonus points.  Rules  The following rules are based on Mayr and Sedlaczek, except where stated:  Dealing  Eight cards are dealt to each player in anticlockwise order, beginning with forehand; then 2 packets of 3 cards are placed, face down, on the table as the talon. Finally, another 8 cards are dealt to each player.  Bidding  Forehand announces \\"Einser\\" (\\"one-er\\") or \\"Weiter!\\" (\\"pass\\"). Rearhand can pass or raise this to a \\"Zweier\\" (\\"two- er\\"). Further bids of Dreier, Vierer and F√ºnfer may be announced, each raising the game value by one increment. The bids must follow in sequence without any being skipped. Moreover, a player who has been overbid must either 'pass' (Weiter) or 'hold' (ich halte). If they hold, they are offering to play the game at the same value and have priority unless they are, in turn, overbid. So a typical sequence is: Einser - Zweier - Weiter - Ich halte - Weiter. In the case of an Einser, Zweier, etc, the winner of the auction, the declarer, may go on to make use of the talon. To do this, both packets of the talon are turned over and laid face up so that all cards are visible. The declarer then picks up one of the two packets and adds it to his hand before discarding three cards of his choice. He then plays as a soloist against the other two players. If a player feels he has a particularly strong hand, he may bid for a Solo or Solo Valat. He must do so at the first opportunity during the bidding. A Solo is an undertaking to win the game without using the talon and outranks the Einser, Zweier, etc. announcements. A Solo Valat is an undertaking to win every trick without the talon - in effect a slam. The final phase of bidding is where various bonuses may be announced (see Scoring).  Playing  Forehand leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit (Farbzwang) or trump (Tarockzwang), but do not have to play to win each trick (i.e. there is no Stechzwang).√Ñnderungen ab 2018/19 at www.tarock.tirol. Retrieved 30 Jun 2018.  Scoring  = Card points = Card points are totalled in the normal way for Tarock games i.e. the cards won are grouped in threes. Each packet of three cards is totted up and 2 card points subtracted. The totals are added to work out the score. A player must score at least 35 points + 2 Blatt to win i.e. 35 and 2/3, which is then rounded up to 36.

The miniature tube-based circuitry follows the \\"All American Five\\" tube design, which allowed a more compact footprint of the radio; suited for sitting atop a fireplace mantle or to be mounted under a kitchen cabinet. One feature of the FM band for this radio is AFC tuning, that allowed the listener to \\"lock-in\\" an FM station without having to worry about station drifting or drops in audio volume associated with FM station tuning.  Construction  The radio is rather small when compared to other tube radios available at the time, with the cabinet (not including 4 hard rubber feet) measuring approx. 17.3 √ó 8.7 √ó 6.3 inches and weighing in at just a couple pounds. Several options for the case were available, including acrylic. However, wooden cases were more common and constructed from a sturdy laminated plywood with a finished (typically walnut) veneer. The rear of the case was made from fiber pegboard material to allow proper ventilation of heat generated by the tubes inside. The tubes are user-replaceable and are easily accessible with the removal of the 3 Philips screws on the back of the unit. The AC power cable terminates to a 2-prong female plug on the rear pegboard case to discourage powering the unit while the cover is removed, as a safety feature.  Internal circuitry  Rear panel removed to show glowing tubes The circuitry used in the radio is based on the \\"All-American Five (miniature)\\" tube setup, sans the 35W4 mini rectifier tube that would have been used at the time in other tube radios.  Tubes used in the 784 Series  RE-784A Tube Location Diagram The 784 series uses a total of six tubes, 5 of which are \\"miniature\\". The only \\"full-size\\" tube is the 17EW8, which is used to drive the AM/FM receiver circuit. * 17EW8: VHF Double [Triode] * 12BE6: Heptode Pentagrid * 12BA6 (two) Pentode: used for RF amplification * 12AV6: Duplex-diodes * 50C5: Beam Pentode used for the power amplifier, which drives the speaker.  Specifications.

The tone knob changes the clarity of broadcasts, as well as integrates the power switch. Turning the tone knob fully counterclockwise shuts the radio off. Internal loudspeaker: 6.50-inch paper cone (dynamic), made by Matushita, 3.2Œ©, 3 Watts  Collectibility  Since AM and FM radio stations still exist throughout the world, the 784-series has not become obsolete quite yet. Not many models of tube FM radios exist, due to the time frame of when this particular radio was released; around the time the transistor made its way into consumer electronics. The 784 is fairly common on the used market (found on sites, such as eBay), with prices ranging between US$25 and $200, depending on condition and cabinet construction. The plywood-constructed 784s are sturdier, due to plastic-cased variants being susceptible to cracking or discoloring. Vacuum tube audio still finds a niche market within the audiophile community. Tube amplification is known for its warmer sound, and known to bring out the fullest of analog media, when compared to solid state audio components . The RE-784 should not be considered an \\"Audiophile\\" radio, but a low-cost gateway into the potential of the tube audio community.  Use and care  All vacuum tubes are susceptible to failure after their useful life has been given up. The 784 includes a circuit diagram printed on the bottom of the unit, as well as a tube location diagram on the rear access panel. Due to the age of the 784, the inside has likely collected dust, and should be lightly blown out with compressed air to prevent a burning smell from the dust. Furthermore, the tops of the tubes should be cleaned with a minor solvent (with the unit disconnected and cooled down) to remove caked-on dust to help dissipate heat for longer life of the tubes. The tubes may become unseated from their sockets during shipping, and care should be taken to prevent them from being subjected to heavy vibrations and shock if the unit needs to be moved. Tube amplifiers can require several minutes to warm up to achieve optimal tonal quality . Unlike transistors, vacuum tubes require sufficient heat to allow the flow of electrons between plates inside of the vacuum Power on procedure: Turn volume knob all the way down. Turn the tone knob clockwise for an affirmative \\"click\\" and wait approximately 45 seconds for the tubes to heat up. You can then adjust the volume and tone accordingly. Tuning an FM station: With the unit powered on, turn the AM/FM knob to FM. Slowly turn the dial to the desired station in the loudest position. The AM/FM knob can then be turned to FM AFC to prevent tuning drift.  Troubleshooting  Any of the six tubes located within the radio will start to show signs of age after several hundreds of hours from normal operation. The simplest method to verify a tube is working is peer into the back of the unit with power applied. If you notice any tubes not glowing orange, there is likely a failed tube or circuit driving the tube. Alternately, some tubes may start showing a purple Plasma (physics) when warming up, which means the tube is likely starting to fail. The most comprehensive way to check the health of the tubes is with a tube tester, which requires removal of the tube and dialing in the specifications and reading results on a meter .

They span an area of 0.7 km2 near the village of Stob, Kyustendil Province. The rock formations are up to 12 m high and up to 40 m thick at the base. Their shape is mostly conical to mushroomlike. Some of the columns are topped by flat stones.  Location  The Stob Earth Pyramids are located at the western foothills of the Rila mountain range in the Balkan Peninsula at an altitude between 600 and 750 m. They occupy the Klisura ridge facing the valley of the Rilska River, a left tributary of the Struma. They are situated at less that one kilometre east of the village of Stob in Kocherinovo Municipality, Kyustendil Province. They lie some 83 km south of the national capital Sofia and 18 km north of the city of Blagoevgrad.  Geology and formation  A view from above A view of the pyramids Geologically, the Stob Earth Pyramids are part of the Blagoevgrad Graben that consists of lakebed, alluvial and sloping deposits dated from the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs. They are built up by Precambrian metamorphic rocks. There are two geological formations: the Dzherman Formation consists of aleurolite, clay and sandstone; the Barakovo one is built up by conglomerate and sandstone. During the Pliocene the area was at the bottom of a shallow lake and accumulated sediments that form a 200 and 250 m thick stratum consisting of little fragments with a lot of clay. The colour is dull white to yellowing. It forms the foundations of the pyramids but the erosion reveals only small patches this layer. The Pleistocene stratum above is reddish with alternating layers of cobble conglomerate and lightly soldered sandstone, as well as larger rock pieces originating from the slopes of Rila. The principal factor for the formation of the Stob Earth Pyramids is erosion due to rainfall. The rain drops penetrate the lightly soldered sediment and continuously wash it away. The location of the rock pieces in the stratum determines the place, size and shape of each pyramid because they prevent the abrasion of the layers below. They are covered by a 1 cm thick coat of hardened sun burned clay which protects the fragile sandstone and delays the erosion.  Description  The Stob Earth Pyramids vary in shape from sharp through conical to mushroomlike. About half of the formations are crowned by rocks, whose area is sometimes two to three times larger than the cross-section of the pyramid below. Their height averages some 6 to 10 m but can reach up to 12 m; the thickness at the base is up to 40 m. Most of them are facing in southern direction but there are also a few grouped together on the northern slopes of the ridge overloocking Stob. Groups of individual Pyramids have been named the Towers, the Brothers, the Hammers, the Wedding Couple, the Pinnacles, the Samodiva Chimneys, etc. They are tourist destination, although not as popular as the much larger Melnik Earth Pyramids. The rock formations are easily accessible via the Struma motorway and the parallel first class I-1 road that form part of European route E79 along the Struma valley. The third class III-107 branches from I-1 at the municipal centre Kocherinovo and heads for 7 km to north-east to Stob. The Stob Earth Pyramids were declared a natural landmark in 1964 with a total extension of the protected area of 7.4 hectares, or 0.74 km2.

In 2001 she received an honorary doctorate from Queensland University of Technology. Career After graduating from the University of Tokyo in 1969, Bando entered the Japanese civil service. She became the first woman in a career post in the office of the Prime Minister of Japan. Her civil service career included numerous posts in the office of the Prime Minister of Japan, the Bureau of Statistics, and the Cabinet Secretariat, including posts overseeing policy on gender equality, youth, and the elderly. In 1978 she wrote the first white paper on gender inequality in Japan. In 1981 she spent a term at Harvard University's Mary I. Bunting Institute studying women managers. From 1995 to 1998 Bando was the Vice Governor of Saitama Prefecture. In 1998, with her appointment as consul general in Brisbane, Australia, she became the first woman to hold a Japanese consul general post. From 2001 to 2003 Bando was the inaugural director general of the Japanese government's Gender Equality Bureau. During Bando's tenure Japan enacted the 2001 Law on Prevention of Spouse Violence and Protection of Victims, which expanded the range of possible domestic violence offenses and penalties and increased government support for survivors. In 2003 she led the Japanese delegation to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. Bloomberg Businessweek described Bando as \\"the Japanese government's front-and-center spokeswoman, cheerleader, and champion of its policy of leveling the playing field for women\\". In the same year, Bando ran for governor of Saitama Prefecture but lost to Kiyoshi Ueda. Showa Women's University Since 2003 Bando has worked in various capacities at Showa Women's University, most recently as president and chancellor. She has claimed that the career change reflected her desire to help women workers more directly through education. During her tenure as chancellor, Showa Women's University eliminated its junior college and partnered with Temple University to move the Temple University, Japan Campus to the Showa Women's University campus. Writing Bando has written books on a variety of topics, including aging, leadership, and etiquette. At age 60 she wrote ', a practical guide for women, especially younger working women, on how to maintain \\"dignity\\" in speech, manners, and dress. The Dignity of a Woman, published in 2006, became the number one bestseller in Japan in 2007. Bando attributed its sales success to \\"the public's appetite for books on traditional values\\". A study by scholar Hiroko Hirakawa found that many women objected to the book's portrayal of the \\"dignified woman\\" as a \\"superwoman who projects an upper-class aura while remaining ever modest and grounded in an appreciation for the old-fashioned values of frugality, respect, and sentiment\\". The Dignity of a Woman sold over three million copies in Japan. Personal life Bando married at the age of 24, while working in the office of the Prime Minister of Japan, and had her first child at age 26. She has two children.

History The original 1988 band consisted of bassist Johnny Hagel, drummer Tommy Karlsson and guitarist Peter Furulid. In 1989, singer Anders Engberg (Lion's Share)and a second guitarist, Mats Liedholm, joined the band. In the same year, the group recorded their first demo Anno 1503, of which 1,500 copies were sold, and the band played two gigs in Stockholm, the first with Count Raven and the second at a festival with other bands, including Entombed, Carnage, Therion and Mezzrow, all of which were playing their first show. In the same year the sampler Rockbox was published, including \\"Born with Fire\\". In 1990 Rickard Evensand joined Sorcerer as new drummer. In 1992 Sorcerer recorded their second demo, The Inquisition, which included a demo version of the Rainbow song \\"Stargazer\\". Later that year, Hagel left the band to join Tiamat. Shortly thereafter, the band disbanded. According to Hagel, his departure was not the reason for the band's dissolution, but the lack of motivation and lack of time of the remaining band members. In 1995, John Perez of Solitude Aeturnus released both demos as a compilation on his label Brainticket Records, Brainticket's first release. Perez and Hail had known each other since the first Sorcerer demo. In 2010, Oliver Weinsheimer offered the band a slot at the German Hammer of Doom Festival. Sorcerer now consisted of Hagel and Engberg and friends of the two. Kristian Niemann and Ola Englund played electric guitar and Robert Iversen the drums. In 2011, Perez re-released the remastered demos. As a bonus, three previously unreleased songs, \\"Wisdom\\", \\"Northern Seas\\" and \\"At Dawn\\", were included. The same year, the band played at the Up the Hammers Festival in Athens, and work began on the debut album. In 2012, Englund left the band to join Six Feet Under; Peter Hallgren joined as a replacement. In the following years, the band continued to work on the album, then the recorded material was mixed and mastered by drummer Robert Iversen. The album was mastered by Jens Bogren and released in 2015 under the name In the Shadow of the Inverted Cross on Metal Blade Records. In 2017, the second album, The Crowning of the Fire King, was published via Metal Blade, and was chosen as \\"album of the month\\" in the German Rock Hard magazine.The Crowning of the Fire King, Rock Hard magazine] (366) Style According to Nadine Fiebig in Nuclear Blast Magazine, In the Shadow of the Inverted Cross had parallels to bands like King Diamond, combined with a \\"haunting voice\\" and \\"grave sounding guitars\\". In the book The Ultimate Hard Rock Guide Vol I - Europe, Sorcerer's music is described as epic doom in the style of Solitude Aeturnus. Janne Stark compared the band with Candlemass and Solitude Aeturnus in his book The Heaviest Encyclopedia of Swedish Hard Rock and Heavy Metal Ever!, but referred to the music as progressive doom metal. In an interview with Patrick Schmidt from Rock Hard magazine, Johnny Hagel stated that besides Solitude Aeturnus, Candlemass, Saint Vitus and Black Sabbath, traditional heavy metal is one of the band's influences. In the same issue, Boris Kaiser stated, in his review of the album, that there were influences from Solitude Aeturnus and Candlemass. The basis of the songs was classical Doom Metal, with additional influences from Hard Rock and Heavy Metal, referring to Rainbow, as did Veni Domine on the album Fall Babylon Fall; he also mentioned Scandinavian melodic and power metal like Memory Garden and Memento Mori as another reference. Sorcerer would also cite Black Sabbath at the time of Headless Cross. Frank Albrecht of the Deaf Forever magazine describes the music as Epic Doom for Candlemass and Solitude Aeturnus worshippers, but not a dull copy, but emphasizing their own features. Because of the demos, the band had a strong reputation.

Located in rural Enterprise Township, the dam was constructed in 1940 by the Civilian Conservation Corps to alleviate flooding from Houghton Lake, which is the source of the Muskegon River approximately upstream. The resulting reservoir is known as the Dead Stream Flooding, and the area is incorporated into the Dead Stream Flooding State Wildlife Management Area, which extends east into neighboring Roscommon County. The Reedsburg Dam is the smallest and newest of the four remaining dams along the Muskegon River, which includes the Croton Dam, Hardy Dam, and Rogers Dam much further downstream. Activities The Reedsburg Dam is located along County Road 300 about northwest of the community of Houghton Lake‚Äî west of U.S. Route 127 and north of M-55. The nearest incorporated city is Lake City about west along M-55. Common fauna in the Muskegon River and Dead Stream Flooding include bluegill, pumpkinseed, small and largemouth bass, walleye, yellow perch, native crayfish, northern pike, and bowfin (colloquially referred to as \\"dogfish\\"). The surrounding area is open to seasonal waterfowl, turkey, and deer hunting. The footpath across the dam is commonly used by hunters to access the more remote wilderness trails‚Äîsome of which belonged to the long-defunct and removed railway lines of the Missaukee Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Other popular activities include bird watching, geocaching, photography, swimming (jumping off the dam into the reservoir), and canoeing/kayaking. Rustic camping is available at the adjacent Reedsburg Dam State Forest Campground on the northeast side of the dam, which is operated by the nearby North Higgins Lake State Park. The campground contains a public boat launch, but larger boats are discouraged due to the shallowness and underwater hazards within the Dead Stream Flooding. Recent history The original Reedsburg Dam structure, which was rebuilt in 2019 Beginning in August 2018, the dam underwent major reconstruction that continued for over one year. The construction was necessary to repair and rebuild the nearly 80-year-old earthen dike and concrete and steel structures. During the project, the Dead Stream Flooding was slowly drained and eventually allowed for only the regular flow of the Muskegon River. In addition, a new steel walkway and staircase replaced the older wooden structures, and a large amount of rocks were trucked in to strengthen the dike along the reservoir and immediate downstream embankments. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan in early 2020, the finishing steps on the construction project were put on delay. According to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, more than 90% of the project was complete before government shutdowns were implemented by Governor Gretchen Whitmer. While the reservoir has seen a significant increase in water levels after the dam was rebuilt, the pre-construction water level will not be reached until at least fall 2020 after the project resumes. The water levels were originally slated to return to normal by summertime. The dam reconstruction project has been completed, but water levels within the reservoir are still noticeably low. The campground remained open throughout the project. The dock at the public boat launch, which no longer reaches the lowering water level, has been moved out of place. The launch itself remains open and usable, although the water levels throughout the reservoir decreased significantly.

Plot Carson Phillips is a private investigator, who is called to investigate a case in his hometown in Texas. He is looking for Barbara Poole, a patient gone missing. Upon reaching the mental facility where she is supposed to be, he notices that the staff all looked nervous when he asks for her. Dr. Miles, the head doctor there, says that he does not know where she is. He meets up with his ex, Jayne, and their daughter, Becky. Becky is married to the star quarterback, Happy. One night during a game, Happy suddenly dies and the police strongly suspect Becky. Jayne asks Carson for help. Becky was being abused by Happy, but since he was the star quarterback, the police would not arrest him. Dr. Miles, the doctor at the mental facility, was killing off his patients, Barbara Poole included, and collecting their social security money. Carson uncovers the truth and Dr. Miles is shot dead by one of the patients. Carson and Jayne reconcile and he finds a bottle of cancer pills. This same substance was found in Happy's blood. He accuses her of \\"doing anything to protect her daughter\\" and realizes that she was the one who poisoned Happy. Becky comes out and asks her if she did it. At first Jayne denies everything, but then admits that she thought that Happy would kill Becky and since she herself did not have long to live, no one would be left to protect her daughter.

It was not an official trial and did not have any legal basis but was widely popular. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party led government filed cases against the organizers of the Gono Adalat which were withdrawn by the next caretaker government. The trial was led by Jahanara Imam. History Jahanara Imam and other activists created the Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Committee on 19 January 1992. The committee campaigned for the trails of collaborators of Pakistan Army who have accused of involvement in the Bangladesh Genocide during the Bangladesh Liberation war in 1971. On 26 March 1992, the Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Committee established the Gono Adalat to hold public mock trials of the alleged collaborators. The movement began after Ghulam Azam was appointed the head of Bangladesh Jamaat- e-Islami in December 1991. The court tried Ghulam Azam, found him guilty and sentenced him to death. The court held trials in Suhrawardy Udyan, the site of the surrender of Pakistani forces at the end of Bangladesh Liberation war. Reception The Government of Bangladesh, then formed by Bangladesh Nationalist Party, was against the Gona Adalat. It filed charges against 28 organizers including Jahanara Imam and Shahriar Kabir over the Gono Adalat. The neutral Caretaker Government led by Justice Habibur Rahman withdrew the charges against them in 1995. The Bangladesh Nationalist party was politically aligned with the Islamist Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami party. The Gono Adalat had the support of the then opposition party, Bangladesh Awami League.

In the mountains classification, points towards the classification are won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. Each climb is categorised as either category SA, A, B or C, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The third jersey represents the young rider classification, marked by an orange jersey. This is decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born on or after 1 January 1995 are eligible to be ranked in the classification. The fourth classification is the sprints classification, the leader of which is awarded a blue jersey. In the sprints classification, riders receive points for finishing in the top three at intermediate sprint points during each stage ‚Äì awarded on a 3‚Äì2‚Äì1 scale ‚Äì and these intermediate sprints also offer bonus seconds towards the general classification as noted above. Additionally, there is a points classification, which awards a green jersey but that jersey is not represented in the race and only present on the podium. In the points classification, cyclists receive points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage, and unlike in the points classification in the Tour de France, the winners of all stages (with the exception of the prologue) are awarded the same number of points. For winning a stage, a rider earns 25 points, with 20 for second, 16 for third, 14 for fourth, 12 for fifth, 10 for sixth with a point fewer per place down to a single point for 15th place. The sixth and final jersey represents the classification for Romanian riders, marked by a red jersey. This is decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born in Romania are eligible to be ranked in the classification. Like the points jersey this is only present on the podium and is not worn in race There are also awards for the team classification, in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage are added together; the leading team at the end of the race is the team with the lowest total time. {   center; font-size:smaller;\\" - style=\\"background-color: #efefef;\\" ! width=\\"2%\\" Stage ! width=\\"12.25%\\" Winner ! width=\\"12.25%\\" General classification 25px ! width=\\"12.25%\\" Mountains classification 25px ! width=\\"12.25%\\" Young rider classification 25px ! width=\\"12.25%\\" Sprints classification 25px ! width=\\"12.25%\\" Points classification 25px ! width=\\"12.25%\\" Romanian rider classification 25px ! width=\\"12.25%\\" Teams classification 25px - scope=row P  Davide Ballerini FFEB64;\\" Davide Ballerini style=\\"background:offwhite;\\" Not awarded FF8C00;\\" Jens Van Den Dool style=\\"background:lightblue; Not awarded 9CE97B;\\" Not awarded style=\\"background:salmon;\\" Eduard-Michael Grosu C0C0C0;\\" - scope=row 1  Ivan Sosa FFEB64;\\" rowspan=4 Ivan Sosa style=\\"background:offwhite;\\" rowspan=4 Ivan Sosa FF8C00;\\" rowspan=4 Ivan Sosa style=\\"background:lightblue;\\" rowspan=3 Adrian Janssen 9CE97B;\\" rowspan=3Ivan Sosa style=\\"background:salmon;\\" rowspan=4 Emil Dima C0C0C0;\\" rowspan=2 - scope=row 2  Stage Cancelled - scope=row 3a  C0C0C0;\\" rowspan=2 - scope=row 3b  Jason Van Dalen style=\\"background:lightblue; 9CE97B;\\" - }  Notes  References  External links  * Sibiu Cycling Tour Category:2018 in Romanian sport Category:UCI Europe Tour races Category:Cycle races in Romania ","title":"2018 Sibiu Cycling Tour"},{"id":"57800642","text":"Benjamin Cassaigne (born 2 April 1976) is a former French tennis player.

Rose (September 8, 1898 ‚Äì June 9, 1954) was an American military officer who served as Adjutant General of Massachusetts and was commander of the 26th Infantry Division. Early life Rose was born on September 8, 1898 in Worcester, Massachusetts. He attended Worcester public schools and the College of the Holy Cross. He enlisted in the Massachusetts National Guard on June 16, 1916 and served with the Emmet Guards on the Mexican border. World War I Rose's company was called into active service during World War I. He served in France, where he rose to the rank of sergeant. Rose was then recommended for officers training school and commissioned a lieutenant. He commanded Co. G, 358th Infantry Regiment, 90th Infantry Division, which was made up of soldiers from Texas and Oklahoma. He led troops during the Meuse- Argonne Offensive and saw action in five major engagements. He received an honorable discharge on July 2, 1919. Post-war years On July 9, 1920, Rose returned to the Emmet Guards as a first lieutenant. He was promoted to Captain on April 13, 1921 and Major on February 18, 1932. In December 1934, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and transferred to the staff of 26th Infantry Division commander Daniel Needham. On December 15, 1934 he was appointed Adjutant General by Governor-elect James Michael Curley. In this role, Rose oversaw deployment of guard forces during floods in the spring of 1936. He also oversaw many Works Progress Administration activities, including the construction of a new Guard facility on Cape Cod. He served as Adjutant General until January 7, 1937, when Curley made him commander of the 26th Infantry Division's 51st Infantry Brigade. His appointment with the 51st was controversial, as he jumped over several officers with higher rank and more years of service. He was promoted to brigadier general shortly thereafter. Outside of the Guard, Rose was the business manager of the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health and purchasing agent for the City of Boston. World War II On January 16, 1941 the 26th Infantry Division was called into federal service. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Rose was placed in command of Task Force 6814 and the 26th Infantry Division. Command of the task force passed to Major General Alexander Patch when it arrived in New Caledonia and Rose was assigned to defend the islands of Effate and Espiritu Santo. Rose also organized defenses and constructed advance air bases on the New Hebrides and Russell Islands. Later life Rose was separated from active duty on February 25, 1946. On September 9, 1946 he returned to the Massachusetts National Guard and was named commander of the 26th Infantry Division. He retired with the rank of Major General on September 8, 1951 due to a state law that required separation after five years as a division commander. Rose died on June 9, 1954 at Quigley Memorial Hospital in Chelsea, Massachusetts and was buried in St. John's Cemetery in Worcester.

They do not contain obsolete systems (such as inactive or underused servers), and take advantage of newer, more efficient technologies. With the exponential growth and usage of the Internet, power consumption in data centers has increased significantly. Due to the resulting environmental impact, increase in public awareness, higher cost of energy and legislative action, increased pressure has been placed on companies to follow a green policy. For these reasons, the creation of sustainable data centers has become essential in an environmental and a business sense.  Energy use  The use of high-performance computing techniques has increased, trading energy consumption for increased performance. Industry estimates suggest that data centers consume three to five percent of the world's global energy. According to an AFCOM State of the Data Center survey, 70 percent of data-center providers indicated that power density per rack has increased significantly since 2013. Managers have been forced to find new ways to power their data centers with renewable energy sources such as hydro, solar, geothermal, and wind. More efficient technologies were developed to decrease data-center power consumption. Hyrdopower generator in Data Center Light, Switzerland  Metrics  Several metrics have been developed to measure power efficiency in data centers. Power usage effectiveness (PUE) and carbon usage effectiveness (CUE) are two frequently-used metrics created by the Green Grid (TGG), a global consortium dedicated to advancing energy efficiency in data centers.  Power usage effectiveness  PUE was invented in 2007, and proposed new guidelines to measure energy use in data centers. : \\\\mathrm{PUE} = {\\\\mbox{Total Facility Power} \\\\over \\\\mbox{IT Equipment Power}} This ratio describes how much extra energy a data center needs to maintain IT equipment for every watt delivered to the equipment. The best PUE a data center can have is 1: an ideal situation, with no extra energy use. When PUE was introduced, studies found that the industry-average PUE was between 2.5 and 3. In more recent studies, the average PUE fell to about 1.7 by using this framework. PUE began the shift of the data-center industry towards energy efficiency. {  - ! PUE ! 1.2 ! 1.5 ! 2 ! 2.5 ! 3 - ! Efficiency level  Very efficient  Efficient  Average  Inefficient  Very inefficient } Although PUE is the most-frequently-used metric for data centers to measure energy efficiency, its reliability is still debated;  Carbon usage effectiveness  Carbon usage effectiveness (CUE) is another metric used to measure energy usage and sustainability in data centers. It is calculated with the following formula: : \\\\mathrm{CUE} = \\\\frac{Total \\\\rm{CO_2} Emissions Caused}{IT Equipment Power} Another way to express this formula is as the product of the carbon dioxide emission factor (CEF) and the PUE, where the CEF is the kg of CO2 produced for each kilowatt-hour of electricity: : \\\\mathrm{CUE} = \\\\frac{\\\\rm{CO_2} emitted (kg\\\\rm{CO_2}eq)}{unit of energy (kWh)} √ó \\\\frac{Total Facility Power}{IT Equipment Power}  Certifications  LEED platinum certification Energy Star Data centers in the United States may apply to be certified as green data centers. The most widely used green building rating system is the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). Developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, it is available in several categories. Depending on ratings, data centers may receive a silver, gold or platinum certification. The platinum certification is given to data centers with the highest level of environmentally-responsible construction and efficient use of resources. Data centers may also be certified under the National Data Center Energy Efficiency Information Program by Energy Star, part of an initiative by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy. The program certifies buildings and consumer products for energy efficiency. Only data centers which are in the top 25 percent in energy performance may receive Energy Star certification. Technologies  Several technologies increase efficiency and decrease energy consumption in data centers.  Low-power servers  IBM modular data center Low-power servers are more energy- efficient than conventional servers in data centers. They use the technology of smartphone computing, which tries to balance performance with energy consumption. The first low-power servers were introduced in 2012 by large IT providers such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard. Used correctly, low-power servers can be much more efficient than conventional servers. They can have a significant impact on data-center efficiency, decreasing power consumption and the operating cost of cooling facilities.  Modular data centers  A modular data center is a portable data center which can be placed anywhere data capacity is needed. Compared with traditional data centers, they are designed for rapid deployment, energy efficiency and high density. These ready-made data centers in a box became very popular. The HP EcoPod modular data center supports over 4,000 data centers with a PUE rating of 1.05 in and free-air cooling.  Free air cooling  upright=1.2thumbalt=Two diagrams of cooling systemsSchematic drawing of server racks with and without cold aisle containment (1) circulating air-cooling device (2) cold aisle (3) server racks (4) warm aisle (5) barrier between cold and warm aisles. Blue lines: flow of cold air; red lines: flow of warm air Free air cooling systems uses outdoor air instead of traditional data-center computer room air conditioner (CRAC) units. Although outdoor air still needs to be filtered and moisturized, much less energy is required to cool a data center with this method. Outdoor air temperature is an issue here, and the data center's location plays a critical role in this technology.  Hot and cold aisle containment  In this method, the rows of racks are aligned with the backs of the servers facing each other; the aisles are enclosed, to capture the air. In hot aisle containment, the heat produced by the servers is pumped to the cooling units. In cold aisle containment, cold air is pumped to the enclosed aisles. Both containment methods are more effective than traditional cooling technologies, and can help reduce energy consumption (and its impact). Although it may be more difficult to implement, hot aisle containment is more effective than cold aisle containment.  Reusing waste heat  Data centers use electric power, releasing more than 98 percent of this electricity as heat. Waste heat can be actively reused, and a data center becomes a closed-loop heating system with no waste. Examples include: * The IBM Reusing Data Center in Switzerland, where the heat warms a local swimming pool * In Finland, the Yandex and Academica data centers replacing the heat used by 500-1,000 homes with data- center energy. * Amazon reused heat from a nearby data center for a biosphere project in Seattle.  Ultrasonic humidification  Facebook's custom-built data center in Prineville, Oregon Some humidity is necessary for data centers to work efficiently and prevent damage to devices and servers. Ultrasonic humidification uses ultrasound to create moisture, using 90 percent less energy than conventional methods such as resistance steam humidifiers.  Evaporative cooling  Evaporative cooling reduces heat by the evaporation of water. Two main methods are used: evaporation pads and high-pressure spray systems. With evaporation pads ‚Äì the more popular method ‚Äì air is drawn through the pads, making water evaporate and cooling the air. The other technique, high-pressure spray systems, needs a larger area and consumes more energy with pumps. Evaporative cooling is dependent on geographical location and season, because both affect the moisture level of the air. Compared to traditional mechanical cooling systems, evaporative cooling generally uses significantly less electricity.

Biography Born in Maidstone, England, to Matilda, n√©e Terry, he was trained as a gardener by his father, George Masters, before moving to Sydney. Masters began working as a gardener, then collecting insects in Queensland for William John Macleay, with the backing of the zoologist Gerard Krefft, later taking a position with the Australian Museum as an assistant curator. Works George Masters was a zo√∂logical collector, primarily of birds, but also of snakes and other animals. Masters also made a significant contribution to entomology, making large collections of insects available for research. He journeyed to remote regions to obtain specimens, including some that will difficult to obtain and are now listed as rare or endangered. His expeditions across the eastern states were extended to South and Western Australia, Tasmania, and Lord Howe Island. Noted collections include a series of specimens of the Queensland lungfish Neoceratodus forsteri, and in Western Australia, Dasyornis longirostris (western bristlebird) and Atrichornis clamosus (noisy scrub bird). Masters made two collections from Australia's south west for the museum in Sydney, noted as exceptional in a period when the study the birds of the region was lacking. He arrived by ship at King George Sound in 1866 for his first expedition, collecting a single specimen of the cryptic noisy scrub bird and two of the western bristlebird in a total of 281 bird skins. His second expedition (1868‚Äì9) was longer and further, journeying from Albany as far as the head of the Pallinup River, returning to Sydney with six more Atrichornis clamosus skins, 10 of Dasyornis longirostris, and eight of Psophodes nigrogularis (western whipbird). These collections also supplemented those of nests and eggs of that state at the Australian Museum, and allowed A. J. North to publish more complete records of its birds oology and nidification in 1889. He continued collecting for himself, Krefft, Macleay, and others, despite an agreement with the museum to desist from doing so for personal gain. Masters is said to have gained extensive knowledge of Australian fauna, but avoided recording this in writing. However, Masters observations of Atrichornis clamosus were published and are important records of a rare and little-known bird. His collections are often cited in North's Nests and eggs of birds found breeding in Australia (publ. 1901‚Äì14). He served as curator at the Macleay Museum until 1912. Legacy Masters is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of Australian venomous snake, Drysdalia mastersii.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

The play was first presented by the Berkeley Repertory Theatre, before touring and being adapted into a television movie.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7722000/ It discusses issues revolving around the themes like race, class and America's school-to-prison pipeline, to mention a few. Background The play is drawn from over 200 interviews with students, parents, teachers and administrators caught in the school-to-prison pipeline. Smith (the author/writer of the play) references several real-life events throughout the play, few of them such as the death of Freddie Gray and an incident where a 15 year-old black girl was restrained by police. Structure The play consists of two acts: during the first act, Smith introduces the people in the school-to-prison pipeline, acting as each character herself. After the interval, she invites the audience to interact through call and response, culminating in Smith asking the audience to sing Amazing Grace. The play makes use of real-life footage, which is projected onto the walls around Smith, such as the video of a 17 year-old black girl being flung across the room by a white male officer. Characters Despite it being a one-woman show, the play has Smith act as 17 different people, each one telling their own story. Smith is also joined onstage by someone playing the double bass, a role originated by composer Marcus Shelby, though it is still a solo performance. Television adaptation Notes from the Field was adapted into a television movie by HBO and premiered in February 2018. It was directed by Kristi Zea, edited by Paul Snyder, and produced by Gary Goetzman and Smith.

Overview  The powers of the Prosecutor‚Äôs Office of the Republic of Azerbaijan are defined in the Constitution 1995, Criminal Procedure Code 2000 and other laws. According to Article 133 of the Constitution 1995, the Prosecutor's Office: * exercises control over the execution and application of laws; * institutes criminal cases and conducts investigations (limited range of offences); * has exclusive power to prosecute on behalf of the state in all criminal courts; * institutes lawsuits (in a limited range) and appeals against court judgements. Unlike many other jurisdictions, the Prosecutor's Office of Azerbaijan belongs to the Judicial Branch of Power. The Prosecutor‚Äôs Office operates as a single centralised body based on the subordination of territorial and specialised prosecutors to the Prosecutor General (PG) of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The PG is appointed and dismissed by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, with the consent of the Milli Majlis (Parliament) of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Apart from the prosecutors and supporting staff, there are also criminal investigators and detectives within the Prosecutor's Office of Azerbaijan. Criminal investigators of the Prosecutor's Office have exclusive jurisdiction over a limited range of serious offences, including crimes against the person, corruption, money laundering, etc. The Anticorruption Directorate (anti-corruption agency) is the only entity of the Prosecutor's Office that employs detectives. In addition to its main functions predominantly in the criminal law area, the Prosecutor's Office is entitled to submit drafts of the legislative proposals directly to the Parliament, a function by enjoyed by few agencies. Prosecutors are empowered to initiate administrative (quasi-criminal) and disciplinary proceedings and submit motions for the elimination of conditions and circumstances conducive to criminal offences, which they discover in the course of their activity. These motions are mandatory for consideration by state and private institutions. Finally, prosecutors have limited authority to represent the state institutions and vulnerable citizens in civil court proceedings. Former President Heydar Aliyev established 1 October as a professional holiday of the Office in July 1998.  History  The history of the prosecuting authorities in the independent Azerbaijan state began after the establishment of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. Regulation on the Chamber of the Court of Azerbaijan was approved by the Council of Ministers on November 18, 1918. Fatali Khan KHOYSKI, Khalil Bay KHASMAMMADOV, A.Safikurdski, T.Makinski were Ministers of Justice and chief prosecutors as well of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. Azerbaijan Democratic Republic was collapsed on April 28, 1920, at the invasion of 11th Army (RSFSR). Declaration of the Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic ensued. The prosecution and investigation bodies were also abolished along with the public authorities after the collapse of Independent Azerbaijan Statehood. Taking into account the need of establishment of a special body to control activities of all authorities in this period, the Soviet Prosecutor's Office was founded in Azerbaijan SSR with the decree of the Central Executive Committee of Azerbaijan ‚ÄòOn the Public Prosecutor's Office of Azerbaijani SSR‚Äô dated July 11, 1922. After the restoration of independence in 1991, the Prosecutor's Office of Azerbaijan was established according to the Constitutional Provision, Prosecutor's Office Act 1999 and the Prosecutor's Office (Service) Act 2001. In order to part with the legacy and turn into a democratic institution, it has undergone substantial reforms.

Basildon United moved into the ground in 1967, and a roof was added to the stand.Weaver, p53 After Basildon United left in 1970, the ground was used by clubs playing in the Southend & District League, Olympian League club Herongate Athletic, and the Essex Eels rugby league club.

He played in Minor League Baseball for the Florida Marlins organization from 1996 through 2000, reaching Triple-A, when a shoulder injury ended his career.https://patch.com/georgia/alpharetta/former-pro-baseball-player- businessman-geoff-duncan-qualifies Duncan retired from baseball and went into business. After retiring from baseball, Duncan and his wife, Brooke, started a small marketing company out of their living room. They ultimately grew the company to a full-scale operation in a 10,000 square foot facility and employed over 100 people. The company was eventually sold, and Duncan later became chief executive officer for Wellview Health, a healthcare and wellness company. Political career Duncan was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 2012. Duncan announced he would run for lieutenant governor of Georgia on April 10, 2017. He resigned from the Georgia House in September 2017 to focus on running for lieutenant governor in 2018. Duncan's campaign was centered around his \\"Policy Over Politics\\" message and focused on ethics reform and fiscal conservatism. Duncan criticized large tax increases passed by the state legislature, including what is known as the Gas Tax, considered to be the largest tax increase in Georgia. This became a central issue during the campaign, as David Shafer--Duncan's primary opponent--led the conference committee that wrote the Gas Tax (HB 170) and fought for its passage in the Senate. On May 22, 2018, Shafer received 48.9% of the vote in the Republican primary with Duncan coming in second place with 26.6%. Since no candidate received a majority of votes, the election then went to a runoff held on July 24. The runoff election focused largely on Shafer's record at the capitol and a number of ethical questions surrounding his candidacy. On July 24, Duncan defeated Shafer with 50.16% of the vote. He narrowly defeated Democratic nominee Sarah Riggs Amico in the general election, receiving nearly 52% of the vote and avoiding another runoff. Duncan was inaugurated lieutenant governor on January 14, 2019. He is the second Republican lieutenant governor in the state's history. Personal life Duncan and his wife, Brooke, have three sons. They live in Cumming, Georgia.

The larvae feed on the leaves of sallows (Salix species). It was first described by the entomologist Peter Cameron in 1883. Description of the gall The gall is formed when the female lays her eggs and injects a substance into the leaf. Up to 8 mm x 6 mm in size, the ovoid gall is similar to E. proxima but often develops near to or on the midrib. At first the galls are green, and as the larva grows, soften and turn red. It often has a thin red rim on the upper surface. Galls of E. bridgmani are found on eared willow (S. aurita), goat willow (S. caprea), grey willow (S. cinerea), S.appendiculata, S. foetidal, halberd willow (S. hastata), tea- leaved willow (S. phylicifolia), S. silesiaca, S. starkeana and S. waldsteiniana.

He is both the faction leader of the Federal Association of Free Voters as well as the Bavarian State Association of Free and Independent Voters, in addition to being the chairman of the Federal Free Voters Party and the Free Voters of Bavaria Party. He has acted as the Party leader of the Parliamentary faction of the Free Voters of Bavaria since 2008.Aiwanger Spitzenkandidat der Freien W√§hler, Bayerischer Rundfunk, 30 June 2018  Early life  Upon graduating from the Burkhart- Gymnasium in Mallersdorf-Pfaffenberg and subsequently finishing his compulsory military service, he studied agricultural sciences at the Weihenstephan College with tuition assistance from the Hanns-Seidel-Stiftung, receiving a degree in Agricultural Engineering. Aiwanger is a Roman Catholic  Political career  Aiwanger joined the Free Voters shortly before the council elections of 2002. He ran as a candidate for the city council of Rottenburg an der Laaber, but narrowly lost the race. He then shortly thereafter rose through the party ranks, joining the regional council of Rottenburg. In 2004 he became a member of the county council in Landshut and had a brief tenure as the district chairman In a surprising series of events he was narrowly elected State Chairman of the Free Voters of Bavaria in a party meeting on 25 March 2006, held in Garsching bei M√ºnchen, winning 340 votes against 322, after the previous chairman declined to run. In October 2014 he was reelected with 92% of the vote. At the executive elections of the Federal Association in Berlin on March 27, 2010 Aiwanger was elected federal chairman of the Free Voters. On February 20, 2010, Hubert Aiwanger was elected to the office of the new Federal Chairman of the Federal Association of Free Voters in M√ºnster when on October 19, 2013, he was confirmed with 88 percent of the vote. The newly founded federal association replaced the previously existing federal voter group, which was required to participate in the European elections. His greatest success came as a result of the 2008 elections, wherein he and the Free Voters won 10.8% of the vote, putting them past the threshold required by the Bavarian Parliament. On October 13, 2012, he was symbolically nominated as the leading candidate of the Free Voters in Bavaria for the local state election. He ran for the constituency Landshut, earning almost 58,000 votes and in September 2013 was reelected for the second time in the state parliament. In the state election on 14 October 2018 he received in the constituency Landshut 25.0% of the first votes; with 102,691 total votes he was re-elected on the list of the constituency of Lower Bavaria. Hubert Aiwanger has been a member of the City Council in Rottenburg an der Laaber since March 2008 and is a district council member in Landshut. Aiwanger failed to reach his goal of leading the Free Voters to the European Parliament in 2009. However, following the successful lawsuits against the percentage hurdle, in May 2014 the Free Voters for the first time sent an MEP to the EU Parliament, Ulrike M√ºller. After the 2018 state elections, he and the Free Voters joined a coalition Government with the leading CSU (Christian Social Union, German: Christlich-Soziale Union), which placed them in the governing Party for the first time. Aiwanger subsequently became the Deputy Prime Minister of Bavaria and became the Bavarian Minister of Economic Affairs, Regional Development and Energy.  Criticisms and Controversies   Criticism of Leadership Style  Aiwanger has been accused of lack of leadership by members of the Federal Executive, especially regarding alleged poor housekeeping of some national associations. This led to the resignation of the Federal Managing Director Cordula Breitenfellner and Judge Bernd Richter. After the designated candidate for the federal election, Stephan Werhahn, allegedly critisied Aiwanger, saying, among other things, \\"dictatorial leadership conditions as in Cuba\\", the board of Saarland demanded his resignation as federal chairman. The run-up to the Federal election in 2013 was met with criticism from within the Free Voters Party.  Controversies  In January and February of 2012, Aiwanger was criticised for tweeting several jokes and as a result of criticism from within his Party, he deleted his Twitter account on February 9, 2012. Since February 2016 Aiwanger has reopened his Twitter account.  Positions   Migration and Immigration Policy  Aiwanger has said in the context of the refugee crisis that Germany must be \\"satisfied and happy\\" that Austria would no longer beckon refugees. He also commented positively on the fact that the Balkan route was closed, but at the same time warned against new waves of refugees. Aiwanger said that politically persecuted people must receive asylum, but he sees them as \\"temporary guests\\". Aiwanger complains that the immigration policy of recent years has been poorly controlled. He subsequently advocates immigration according to the Canadian merit-based model.  EU Bailouts  Aiwanger has positioned the Free Voters as a protest party against the Euro Bailout policy. Their demonstrations for this cause have been criticized by the likes of the Green Party.  Political Successes   Achievements  = Successful referendum campaign designed to reintroduce the G9 Gymnasium system = Aiwanger and the Free Voters successfully organized a referendum on the issue of the Gymnasium length in 2014 with the intent of reintroducing the 9 year Gymnasium in Bavaria as opposed to the 8 year Gymnasium that most states in Germany had started switching to since the early 2000s. The Free Voters succeeded in reinstituting the G9, despite opposition from the CSU, who wanted to introduce a ‚Äúflexibilization year‚Äù for Gymnasium students, i.e. an optional 9th year, as well as the Greens, who simply want to improve the G8 system. = Abolition of Tuition Fees in Higher Education = From the 17th until the 30th of July 2013, the Aiwanger and the Free Voters successfully campaigned for a referendum to abolish college tuition in Bavaria. The referendum ‚ÄúNo to school tuitions in Bavaria‚Äù (German: Nein zu Studiengeb√ºhren in Bayern) earned 14.3% of the 2013 vote. After the Bavarian Parliament approved the proposal it was implemented during the 2013/2014 school year. = Abolition of road improvements contribution taxes = Under Aiwanger's leadership, the Free Voters have also successfully abolished taxes regarding road improvement contributions (German: Stra√üenausbaubeitr√§ge, shortened to Strab). This tax was paid for by homeowners on the street in which road improvement was occurring in order to finance the road maintenance. After the 1st of January, 2018, this tax was no longer levied due to the Free Voter's efforts.

Abolish ICE is a political movement that proposes abolition of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The movement gained traction in June 2018, due to controversy of the Trump administration family separation policy. History Immigration and Customs Enforcement was created in 2003, as part of the newly formed U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The agency's young age has been a point of discussion, with proponents of Abolish ICE arguing that the United States can easily do without an agency that has only existed for less than twenty years. Though the agency controversially expanded under Barack Obama, frustrating advocates for immigrants' rights, its stated focus remained the deportation of those undocumented immigrants who were convicted of a crime. In practice, however, ICE had been seen to target individuals solely on the crime of having previously entering the country illegally. In 2014, the National Immigration Law Center (NILC) filed a lawsuit against ICE and DHS under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The NILC obtained documents that revealed the sharing of information between ICE/DHS and State Motor Vehicle Departments for the purpose of immigration enforcement. After Trump took office in January 2017, his administration began to implement harsher immigration policies, such as denying asylum to refugees and separating undocumented children from their families, which spurred the growth of the movement. Sean McElwee, co-founder of left-wing think tank Data for Progress, is credited with coining the slogan by creating the hashtag #AbolishICE. He first used the hashtag on his Twitter account in February 2017, shortly after Trump's inauguration.Breland, Ali. \\"How Twitter vaulted 'Abolish ICE' into the mainstream\\", The Hill, July 29, 2018.Relman, Eliza. \\"The first signs are emerging that the progressive campaign to abolish ICE is working\\", Business Insider, July 24, 2018. In August 2017, a series of protests over the agency took place in Oakland, California. However, a group of Oakland police escorted ICE and DHS agents to the site of a search, sparking controversy and protests over the sanctuary policy breach. ICE later stated that the agency was serving a federal search warrant for suspected child trafficking, and was not conducting a deportation.\\"ICE raid in West Oakland related to human trafficking involving minors\\", Bay City News, August 16, 2017. Conservatives criticized the protesters for interfering with the investigation. Controversy over the Trump administration family separation policy in 2018 brought the movement into the mainstream of political discussion. Dan Canon, a Democratic candidate for congress in Indiana, was the first candidate to call for ICE to be eliminated; Randy Bryce, a Democratic congressional candidate in Wisconsin, followed soon after in April. Bryce's opponent, Paul Ryan, who was then the Speaker of the House of Representatives, said that abolishing ICE was \\"the craziest position I have ever seen\\". On June 20, at the height of the family separation controversy, protestors approached Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen at a restaurant, chanting \\"Abolish ICE\\". Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist and Democratic primary challenger to Representative Joseph Crowley, made abolishing ICE one of her top campaign issues. In the wake of her unexpected victory on June 26, the position became more widely accepted by progressive politicians, including Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The change was particularly strong in Ocasio- Cortez's state of New York, where Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio quickly embraced the abolition of ICE after the win. On June 25, Wisconsin congressman Mark Pocan announced that he would introduce legislation to dismantle ICE and establish a commission to determine how the government \\"can implement a humane immigration enforcement system\\", after visiting the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border and witnessing \\"the nation‚Äôs immigration crisis\\".\\"Following Trip to Southern Border, Pocan to Introduce Legislation that Would Abolish ICE\\", Rep. Mark Pocan, June 25, 2018. Pocan was joined by Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Adriano Espaillat of New York in introducing the bill, the Establishing a Humane Immigration Enforcement System Act, on July 12.Cummings, William. \\"House Democrats introduce bill to abolish ICE, create 'humane' immigration system\\", USA Today, July 12, 2018. Nineteen ICE agents wrote a letter to Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen asking for the ICE to be split into two separate agencies because they believe the institution inhibits their ability to do their job properly. Their proposal would separate the enforcement and removal unit, which is the subject of almost all of the controversy, from the investigations unit that focuses on issues such as fraud, human trafficking, gangs, and drug rings. They believe that sanctuary jurisdictions would be more likely to work with the investigative unit if it were separate. Rallies in support of abolition Several protests, rallies, and marches‚Äîincluding Occupy ICE, Families Belong Together, and Women Disobey‚Äîcalled for the abolition of ICE and decarceration of undocumented immigrants. These rallies took place over several months in over 700 cities in the United States and around the world. Reactions Trump has accused Democrats of advocating for the abolition of ICE, saying that if \\"you get rid of ICE, you‚Äôre going to have a country that you‚Äôre going to be afraid to walk out of your house\\". He predicted that Democrats would get \\"beaten so badly\\" in the 2018 midterm elections because of the issue (the Democrats gained control of the House, but the Republicans expanded their majority in the Senate in the elections). Vice President Mike Pence visited ICE's headquarters in the wake of the controversy, calling ICE and Border Patrol agents \\"heroes\\".Gomez, Alan and Kevin Johnson. \\"Vice President Pence blasts calls to abolish ICE, calls agents 'heroes'\\", USA Today, July 6, 2018. Most Democratic politicians, such as Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Kamala Harris of California, believe that ICE should be reformed rather than abolished. Harris stated that Democrats should \\"critically re-examine ICE\\" and \\"think about starting from scratch\\" with American immigration policy, while Senator Bernie Sanders stated that Democrats should instead encourage Trump to work with them on \\"a national program which deals with this serious issue.\\"Bolton, Alexander. \\"Abolishing ICE becomes Dem litmus test\\", The Hill, June 30, 2018. National polling by Pew Research Center in July 2018 found that ICE was one of the least popular government agencies among Americans. The same poll found that public support of the agency was sharply partisan: 72% of Democrats hold unfavorable view of the agency, while 72% of Republicans were found to have a \\"favorable opinion\\" of the agency. National polling by POLITICO/Morning Consult in July 2018 found that 25% of Americans favored abolishing ICE, while a majority supported keeping it. In August 2018, national polling by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 37% of Americans hold an unfavorable opinion of ICE. The same poll found that 24% of Americans support abolishing ICE. Commentators have noted that U.S. Customs and Border Protection, not ICE, is responsible for border enforcement, so abolishing ICE alone would not end the ability of the United States to enforce its immigration laws, nor would it necessarily end the controversial practice of family separation that spurred support for the movement.

The former Yugoslav constituent republics of Slovenia (2004) and Croatia (2013) have joined the European Union as independent states, North Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro have been negotiating their accession since 2020, 2012 and 2010 respectively, Bosnia and Herzegovina applied in 2016, and partially recognised Kosovo is recognised as a potential candidate for membership within the Western Balkans enlargement agenda of the EU. Numerous politicians, academics, and public persons commented on the alleged missed opportunity of Yugoslav EEC membership, including Stjepan Mesiƒá, Kiro Gligorov, Milorad Dodik, Tvrtko Jakovina, Claudio Gerardini, Vuk Dra≈°koviƒá, Vladislav Jovanoviƒá, and Cornelius Adebahr.  History   1948‚Äì1967  After the 1948 Tito‚ÄìStalin Split, Yugoslavia realigned its foreign policy from the close alliance with the Soviet Union to de facto western orientation, and then neutrality, to ultimately a Non-aligned course. The 1953 Balkan Pact signed by Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia allowed Yugoslavia to associate itself with NATO indirectly until 1956 and the end of Informbiro period. In 1950 Yugoslav Radio Television became one of the founding members of the European Broadcasting Union and it canceled its membership in the IBO that same year. In 1962 Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia was the first East European nation for which the Council of the European Economic Community accepted the possibility to start technical talks on cooperation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Yugoslavia held topical meeting on Yugoslav relations with Western European states on February 26, 1964 concluding that those relations are continually improving.Milutin Tomanoviƒá (1965) Hronika meƒëunarodnih dogaƒëaja 1964, Institute of International Politics and Economics, p254 (in Serbo-Croatian) During the meeting special attention was given to the Yugoslav relations with West Germany where Ministry commended results in mutual trade, tourist visits and scientific cooperation. On the other hand, the Ministry have criticized German toleration of disruptive activities of post-World War II anti-Yugoslav emigration, campaigns against Koƒça Popoviƒá and postponing of judicial proceeding against the organizers and perpetrators of terrorist attack on Yugoslav representation in Bad Godesberg on November 29, 1962. The Ministry also criticized unwillingness to fulfill obligations and indemnities to the Yugoslav victims of World War II. 1968‚Äì1987 Due to developed economic relations and large expat community relations with the West Germany played particularly important role in the set of Yugoslav bilateral relations with the EEC member states. Formal bilateral relations between Yugoslavia and West Germany were canceled in accordance to the Hallstein Doctrine after the 1957 Yugoslav recognition of East Germany limiting relations almost exclusively to the economics field. In 1965 expert negotiations with EEC began as well as talks on extent of future economic cooperation and potential trade exchange. Relations were reestablished after the election of Willy Brandt and his 1968 visit to Yugoslavia within his Ostpolitik efforts. Tito and Brandt discussed war reparations leading to the creation of the so called Brioni Formula focused on development aid and loans under highly generous conditions instead of formal reparations. This formula enabled Yugoslavia to receive up to 1 billion Deutsche Mark and was subsequently used with Poland. Belgrade expressed its dissatisfaction with unequal treatment of numerous Yugoslav workers in Germany compared to Italian, Spanish and Turkish workers and with the activities of nationalist emigration groups. There was also certain dissatisfaction with some of the ceremonial aspect of Ostpolitik in which the Socialist Republic of Romania normalized its relations with West Germany before Yugoslavia and in which famous 1970 Kniefall von Warschau in Warsaw was not followed by similar gesture to victims of Kragujevac massacre during his second visit to Yugoslavia in 1973. Despite some inherent tensions focus of renewed bilateral relations was on international relations including crisis in the Middle East and Vietnam, Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and D√©tente in Europe and activities of the Non-Aligned Movement. Already in 1967 the formal Declaration on the relations between SFR Yugoslavia and the EEC was signed. In 1969, after the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Permanent Mission of the SFRY to the EEC has been opened. In 1977 the EEC granted access to the European Investment Bank to Yugoslavia. During the 1977-1978 Belgrade was the host city of the first follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Co- operation in Europe. By 1980 European Investment Bank granted two loans in total value of 50 million of ECUs to link the Yugoslav high-voltage electricity distribution network to the Greek and Italian grids and for the construction of part of the trans-Yugoslav road. In 1978, the European Community and Yugoslavia began negotiations on a Cooperation Agreement, which was signed in April 1980 and entered into force in April 1983. Cooperation Agreement contained provisions concerning trade, financial aid and cooperation in the areas of industry, science and technology, energy, agriculture, transport, the environment and tourism. This agreement was the third one between the two sides and was enabled by Community's willingness to raise its tariff ceilings, which under the previous agreement were much lower for agricultural products. Despite reservation of some of its member states Community was willing to offer more advantageous trading conditions for Yugoslavia due to raising trade imbalance, and increased Yugoslavia's export to Comecon market which became its a's largest export market in 1974 and its largest overall trading partner in 1978, fact which caused worry both in Brussels and Belgrade. The new agreement included provisions on a wider co- operation in the fields of industry, agriculture, science and technology, energy, tourism and transportation. Special attention was paid to regulation the status of temporary Yugoslav workers while Yugoslavia was recognized as a developing country which meant that trading obligations were no longer equal on both sides but puts a higher formal burden to the community. 1988‚Äì1992 Budimir Lonƒçar On 8 June 1988, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Budimir Lonƒçar said to the members of collective Presidency of Yugoslavia that there are significant integration processes going on in Europe and single market is created which requires adaptation from Yugoslavia. In late 1989, Yugoslavia initiated signing of the association agreement as at that time close to 70% of Yugoslav foreign trade was done with the EEC countries. French politician Claude Cheysson who was member of the Delors Commission responsible for Mediterranean policy and North-South relations was the strongest advocate of Yugoslav integration with Italian Gianni De Michelis and German Hans Dietrich Genscher not being opposed to the idea. Genscher was of opinion that Yugoslavia may additionally strengthen EEC credibility among the non-NATO member countries, yet official negotiations did not start at that time. In May 1991 EC President Jacques Delors and Luxembourg Prime Minister Jacques Santer offered to sign an association agreement and an agreement on 5.5 billion dollars support for structural reforms, yet at that time the Yugoslav Wars already were in their initial phase. The two biggest constituent republics, Croatia and Serbia, which were dominated by nationalist leaderships refused the proposal. In June 1991 an EEC mission formed by the foreign ministers of Luxembourg, Italy and the Netherlands visited Belgrade, where they talked with Yugoslav Prime Minister Ante Markoviƒá, as well as Zagreb, where they talked with Presidents Milan Kuƒçan of Slovenia and Franjo Tuƒëman of Croatia. The mission members stated that almost $1 billion in economic aid would be suspended if Yugoslav military offensive continued as well as that the EEC favors the preservation of Yugoslavia as a single entity. Community's concern was Yugoslav geographic position which just like Switzerland divided northern and southern parts of the Community into two. Members of the EEC were divided over the importance they should give to the potentially contradictory principles of self-determination and territorial integrity. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl strongly stressing the right to self-determination, French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand arguing against immediate cutoff of aid to Yugoslavia, while Spain, Italy and United Kingdom insisted on the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia. On 25 November 1991, due to the escalation of hostilities and violations of human rights, all agreements on co-operation between the EEC and SFR Yugoslavia were canceled. Widely perceived EEC's failure in former Yugoslavia, which undermined community's credibility and forced it to ask for United Nations, United States and Russian support, have influenced future development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty in November 1993 which established the EU and introduced Common Foreign and Security Policy was deeply symbolically marked by the failure to reach a common stance in Yugoslavia.

The band formed in the 1980s and released two studio albums for Reprise Records. Their sound incorporated several influences, chiefly Indie folk, Dream pop, and New wave music, blending vocal harmonies, acoustic guitars, and drums, with airy synth atmospherics and digital percussion. History 1980-1987: Formation Grace Pool founders Elly Brown and Bob Riley met when they were bandmates in South, a music project featuring the legendary guitarist Lonnie Mack. Brown was already well-known for her own bands in the New York club scene, and was hired to sing harmonies and some \\"girl vocals.\\" Riley had established himself as an in-demand session musician. During the South rehearsals, Brown and Riley wrote the first of many songs together. When South came to a sudden end after the death of the band's founder and patron, Brown and Riley returned to their previous musical projects, remaining close friends and songwriting partners. Three years later, Brown and Riley had fallen in love, married, and moved into a house in Lincolndale, a rural suburb in upstate New York. Riley created an in-home studio where he created sequenced drum tracks and played guitar while Brown sang. During the next several years, the natural surroundings of upstate New York were an inspiration for the songs that formed Grace Pool's repertoire. When Brown and Riley decided it was time for the songs to be played for audiences, they recruited some musician friends into the band. Clifford Carter and Frank Vilardi were brought in on keyboards and drums. Shawn Colvin, a friend of Elly Brown, played guitar for the early Grace Pool rehearsals and performances. Their New York City debut was at the legendary CBGB, chosen for the club's highly regarded sound system. Not long after, Colvin's solo career became a full-time occupation. Her place was filled by Terry Radigan, a young girl from Brooklyn. Grace Pool signed on with Reprise in 1987 when Elly Brown's best friend, who worked at Warner Bros. Records, slipped a demo tape to a music executive. Within weeks, the band was offered a contract. 1988-1989: Grace Pool The band's first album, the self-titled Grace Pool, was released in August 1988. The record was produced by Steve Nye, known for his atmospheric style on recordings by Bryan Ferry, David Sylvian, Clannad, and many others. Trouser Press praised Nye's \\"deft touches of synthesizer ambiance and quiet grandeur,\\" and called Grace Pool \\"a record with catchy songs, fine harmonies and intricately subtle arrangements.\\" The Washington Post described Brown's \\"clear, cool-water voice\\" \\"luxurious\\" harmonies, \\"sensual, not sorrowful\\" minor-key melodies, and the band's songs as having \\"a dreamy, pre-Raphaelite beauty.\\" The collection of original songs also includes Grace Pool's cover of a song by The Blue Nile, \\"Stay,\\" a song that Elly Brown knew she wanted to sing from the moment she heard it. The band was named in a New York Times article along with k.d. lang, Joan Jett, Edie Brickell and Cocteau Twins as part of \\"a diverse, intelligent, self-directed and eccentric bunch of female performers\\" with new recordings in 1988. Rolling Stone introduced the band to their readers in New Faces. Grace Pool was nominated for a New York Music Award in the Best Debut Album category. 1990-1991: Where We Live The recording of Where We Live, Grace Pool's second album, brought changes in band members and changes of perspective and attitude. Brown has described the album as \\"songs of struggle and not understanding the world so well.\\" There was also a change of producer in the studio, as Bob Riley was allowed to take over production duties. With many years as a New York studio musician and a passion for music technology, Riley crafted the album with what the Chicago Tribune called \\"a polished, stylish sound.\\" Music journalist Stewart Mason wrote that Where We Live was \\"less abstract and artsy\\" than the debut album with \\"more of a rock edge.\\" He described the album's songs with minor-key melodies as \\"a collection of haunting tunes.\\" Beki Brindle was the band's new lead guitarist on the album, replacing Terry Radigan who had set off on her own career. Andy Burton, known for his keyboard work on the Hammond organ, became the band's keyboardist. The band was also beginning to feel the effects of being a part of a music industry, after years immersed in the New York music scene. In Brown's words, \\"we were losing the stars in our eyes.\\" Signing to a major record label with headquarters on the distant West Coast proved to be a less than perfect fit for the band, and Grace Pool was released from contract by Warners after sales of Where We Live were not as strong as the debut. The group disbanded in 1992.  Post-band life, recordings and collaborations After Grace Pool, each of the members remained deeply involved in music. Brown and Riley began a family and raised two children while working on new musical projects. Elly Brown recorded a solo album, Wax the Roses in 2004. Bob Riley collaborated with various artists including Mary Fahl, originally of October Project. Grace Pool's guitarists, Terry Radigan and Beki Brindle, have fronted their own bands and recorded solo albums, continuing to tour. Frank Vilardi went on to record or tour with various bands including Rosanne Cash, Suzanne Vega, Rod Stewart and many others. He is currently a member of The Bacon Brothers band. Keyboardist Clifford Carter worked extensively with James Taylor among many others and recorded a solo album, Walkin' Into the Sun, in 1993. Keyboardist Andy Burton is currently a member of The Schramms.

The total length of main pipeline in Azerbaijan is 300x300px The centre of the country's oil industry and nexus of its pipelines are at Baku. The first oil pipeline was formed in Absheron district in connection with oil production in the country. The total length of the country's oil pipeline is more than , with 80% of it located in the Absheron Economic Region. Important oil pipelines within the republic include: Shirvan‚ÄìBaku (former Ali- Bayramly‚ÄìBaku), ; Shirvan‚ÄìDashgil, ; Dubandi-Boyukshor, ; Dubandi-Keshla, ; Dashgil-Sangachal-Keshla, ; Buzovna-Sabunchu, ; and Binagadi-Keshla, .  Pipelines  There had been an oil industry at Baku since at least the 17th century. Beginning in the 19th century, pipelines were constructed to transport crude oil from the oil fields to the refineries. The first pipeline was constructed in 1878 by Baku Oil Refinery, connecting to Balakhani Mines. The Baku‚ÄìBatumi oil pipeline was put into operation in the beginning of the 20th century. Oil and gas field exploitation in Absheron and the Caspian Sea required construction of new pipelines to Baku. These main oil pipelines are Alibayramly‚ÄìBaku, Neftdashlari‚ÄìBaku, and Siyazan‚ÄìBaku. Natural gas is transported through Garadagh‚ÄìAgstafa, Garadagh‚ÄìBaku, Siyazan‚ÄìBaku, Neftdashlari‚ÄìBaku, and Zira‚ÄìBaku pipelines. The main route options for export pipelines (to Europe) are: * Baku-Batum pipeline (1897-1907) * Baku‚ÄìGrozny‚ÄìNovorossiysk ( the northern route) * Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìSupsa (the western route) * Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìCeyhan (main oil pipeline named after Heydar Aliyev) * Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìErzurum gas pipeline (a.k.a. Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline)  Baku‚ÄìGrozny‚ÄìTikhoretsk‚ÄìNovorossiysk  The agreement for the northern route was signed on February 18, 1996, in Moscow. This pipeline transports Azerbaijani oil into the Russian Federation to the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. The total length of the Baku‚ÄìGrozny‚ÄìTikhoretsk‚ÄìNovorossiysk (BGTN) oil pipeline is , including in Azerbaijan. The transportation of Azerbaijani oil through the northern route started on October 25, 1997. A trilateral agreement signed among AIOC (Azerbaijan International Operating Company), SOCAR (State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic) and Transneft (the Russian state-owned pipeline company) includes all legal and technical issues of transportation of oil to Novorossiysk. Russia accepted in the agreement that the ownership of the oil remains with the producer, which is part of Azerbaijan's new oil strategy. It was intended to transport 2.5 thousand tons of crude oil per day through Dubandi‚ÄìBoyukshor‚ÄìSiyazan‚ÄìShirvanovka pipeline. 120 thousand tons of oil had been exported through the northern route by the end of 1997. Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìSupsa The second pipeline is the western route, Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìSupsa, made through an agreement between the presidents of Azerbaijan and Georgia on March 8, 1996. It has a total length of with in Azerbaijan. It transports primary Azeri oil from Azeri‚ÄìChirag‚ÄìGunashli fields through Baku. Trilateral contracts were signed among AIOC, SOCAR and the Georgian government. This line was put into operation on April 17, 1999, and exports 15 million tons of oil per year to Western countries It has lower operating costs than the northern route; transporting a ton of oil to Novorossiysk costs 15.67, but to Supsa is $13.14. From the Georgian port of Supsa, oil can then be shipped via the Bosporus.  Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìCeyhan  303x303px The Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìCeyhan pipeline transports oil to the Tukish port of Ceyhan on the Caspian Sea for export to European markets through the Mediterranean. It has a total length of with in Azerbaijan, in Georgia and in Turkey. Since 2006, 50 million tons of oil per year is exported through this pipeline.  Baku‚ÄìTbilisi‚ÄìErzurum gas pipeline  A commercial agreement was signed on the sale of natural gas from Turkmenistan to Turkey, carried via pipeline through Azerbaijan and Georgia to the Turkish port of Erzurum in Turkey, from where it will be sold to Europe. The pipeline was planned to be long with a capacity of 30 billion cubic metres per year.  Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline  The Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline (TANAP) is planned to transport natural gas across Turkey, expanding the capacity from the South Caucasus pipeline. It is to start in Azerbaijan and connect to several pipelines in the European Union. The projected cost of the pipeline and associated infrastructure is 7 billion. The first of four stages was to be completed in 2018. Planned capacity of the pipeline is 16 billion cubic meters in 2020, 23 billion cubic meters in 2023, and 31 billion cubic meters in 2026. During the first period, it is to be sold 10:6 to Europe and Turkey, with the European portion being transported through Turkey to Bulgaria or Greece.  Trans Adriatic gas pipeline  Wholly outside of Azerbaijan, the Trans Adriatic Pipeline project (TAP) would connect TANAP to European pipelines. The planned pipeline would connect to TANAP at the Greece‚ÄìTurkey border, passing through Greece, Albania, and crossing the Adriatic Sea to Italy. In Italy, it is to connect with the \\"Snam Rete Gas\\" (SRG) network. The TAP project was chosen as the most-direct way to export natural gas from Azerbaijan to European markets. An intergovernmental agreement was signed between Albania, Italy and Greece in February 2013.

He was the director of the Seuerling theater Company in 1768-93 and as such the leader of one of only two professional Swedish language theater companies in Sweden of the era. Life Carl Seuerling was originally from Germany and arrived to Sweden as the leader of a travelling theater company in 1760. He married the Swedish actress Margareta Seuerling (1747‚Äì1820) in 1768 and took over the theater company of her father, Peter Lindahl (1712‚Äì1792). The Seuerling travelling theater company performed all over Sweden and Finland, and was in many parts they visited the first theater performing. Historically, they have not been described as a theater company of great quality - they often experienced a shortage of staff, inexperienced actors and performed in conditions which did not give the chance of high quality scenery, the strong German accent of Carl Seuerling was caricatured, and anecdotes of failed performances circulated, particularly among the upper classes. However, these judgement are likely overreactions from an elite audience used to the theatres in the capital; in the provincial press, the company are often given positive reviews, and they were popular among the public in the towns and the countryside in which they toured, playing a pioneering role in Swedish theater history. Seuerling introduced the works of William Shakespeare on the Swedish stage by staging the first performance of Romeo and Juliet at the Egges theater in Norrk√∂ping 5 August 1776, with himself and his wife in the main parts. In 1793 Carl Seuerling left his theater to Johan Peter Lewenhagen (1770-1832). However after his death in 1795, his wife took over the company. Seuerling had seven children. He was the father of Carl Fredrik Seuerling (d. 1831), the actor Gustaf Wilhelm Seuerling, the school teacher Gottfrid Ferdinand Seuerling (1775-1826), the actress Carolina Seuerling (1769-1821), the musician Charlotta Seuerling and the governess Gustafva Margaretha Seuerling (1786-1863).

It carries a single wooden-decked lane for one- way eastbound vehicular traffic and two walkways. Completed in 1889, it is the least-used of the 794 bridges and tunnels operated by the New York City Department of Transportation, with an average of about one thousand crossings each weekday. One of only four remaining retractable bridges in the United States, it is an official city landmark.  Description  The Carroll Street Bridge is composed of a span supported by a pair of riveted steel plate girders. The span is wide and contains one eastbound lane of vehicular traffic and one walkway to either side. It carries the street of the same name within the neighborhood of Gowanus, Brooklyn. The posted restrictions are a height limit of and a weight limit of . The movable portion of the span is shaped like a trapezoid. Carriage truck frames, supported by wheels, are located underneath the girders. When the bridge is retracting, these frames run along three timber-supported steel rails that run diagonally on the western bank of the canal to the south of the span, which opens up a channel for ships to pass. The frames are moved by a series of pulleys. Originally, the span was retracted using a steam engine, but today it is powered by an electric motor. Swinging gates on either side close off the span whenever the Carroll Street Bridge is in the open position. An operator's house is located on the bridge's western end along the southern sidewalk. The booth is normally unmanned, but a bridge attendant can travel to the operator's house within two hours in case the bridge needs to be opened. The Carroll Street Bridge is one of four remaining retractable bridges in the United States, and one of two remaining in New York City, the other being the Borden Avenue Bridge in Queens. The city formerly had as many as five retractable bridges, but three of these bridges, in Brooklyn, Staten Island, and the Bronx, were removed in the mid-20th century.  History  View of the spanIn the 1860s, a developer named Edwin Litchfield straightened and expanded the Gowanus Creek into a canal. This resulted in the surrounding swamp being dried up, making it desirable for development. The Gowanus Canal soon became a hub for industrial activity, with businesses specializing in lumber, coal, brick, stone, flour, and plaster. The canal was crossed by six bridges, including one at Carroll Street. When the first Carroll Street bridge closed in 1887, there was a discussion regarding the design of its replacement. Landowners wanted to build a retractable span that would allow the bridge to slide diagonally onto the shore, but the city of Brooklyn resisted, since this would entail acquiring additional land. Ultimately, the city of Brooklyn chose the landowners' plan. This design was chosen since the canal was narrower at Carroll Street, and a more conventional bascule bridge design might prevent some boats from passing. The new Carroll Street Bridge was designed by chief engineer Robert Van Buren and engineer-in- charge George Ingram. Charles O. H. Fritzche designed the motors while Cooper, Hewitt & Company constructed the steel superstructure. The bridge opened in 1889 at a cost of $29,600. After the Carroll Street Bridge was completed, very few modifications were made to it. The steam motors were supplanted by electric motors in 1908, while the rails and wheels were replaced in 1915 and the handrails were replaced in 1948. In 1971 the New York City government decided to permanently close the Carroll Street Bridge. At the time, there was a steady decline in the use of the Gowanus Canal, and the city did not have sufficient funds to operate the bridge. The span was only being used by 2,600 cars a day, but had to open twice a day on average. Initially scheduled to be closed on May 28, 1971, the span's closure was later delayed to June 25, and the control station was boarded up. Following protests from residents, the city decided to reopen the Carroll Street Bridge the following month. In 1974, the bridge was closed again for emergency repairs after a mechanical failure left the span in the open position. Another incident in 1985 or 1986 caused the Carroll Street Bridge to be stuck in the open position for several years. During this time, the bridge was used as a filming location for the 1985 movie Heaven Help Us. The bridge was designated an official New York City landmark in 1987, with the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission calling it \\"rare and unusual\\". The restored bridge was reopened on September 24, 1989. It was subsequently repaired again in 2011. After being damaged during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the Carroll Street Bridge was repaired the following year.

ZMap was designed for information security research and can be used for both white hat and black hat purposes. The tool is able to discover vulnerabilities and their impact, and detect affected IoT devices. Using one gigabit per second of network bandwidth, ZMap can scan the entire IPv4 address space in 44 minutes on a single port.  Operation  ZMap architecture ZMap iterates on techniques utilized by its predecessor, Nmap, by altering the scanning method in a few key areas. Nmap sends out individual signals to each IP address and waits for a reply. As replies return, Nmap compiles them into a database to keep track of responses, a process that slows down the scanning process. In contrast, ZMap uses cyclic multiplicative groups, which allows ZMap to scan the same space roughly 1,300 times faster than Nmap. The ZMap software takes every number from 1 to 232-1 and creates an iterative formula that ensures that each of the possible 32-bit numbers is visited once in a pseudorandom order. Building the initial list of numbers for every IP address takes upfront time, but it is a fraction of what is required to aggregate a list of every sent and received probe. This process ensures that once ZMap starts sending probes out to different IPs, an accidental denial of service could not occur because an abundance of transmissions would not converge on one subnet at the same time. ZMap also speeds up the scanning process by sending a probe to every IP address only once by default, whereas Nmap resends a probe when it detects a connection delay or fails to get a reply. This results in about 2% of IP addresses being missed during a typical scan, but when processing billions of IP address, or potential IoT devices being targeted by cyberattackers, 2% is an acceptable tolerance.  Usage  ZMap can be used for both vulnerability detection and exploitation. The application has been used for port 443 scans to estimate power outages during Hurricane Sandy in 2013. One of the developers of ZMap, Zakir Durumeric, used his software to determine a computer's online state, vulnerabilities, operating system, and services. ZMap has also been used to detect vulnerabilities in universal plug and play devices and search for weak public keys in HTTPS website logs.

Prewar life  Besikbayev was born in 1920 to a Kazakh family the village of Ilinskoe in the Turkestan ASSR, in the area that is now Almaty, Kazakhstan. Upon reaching military age he was drafted into the Red Army and assigned to the Air Force, where he reached the rank of Junior Sergeant as a radio operator and gunner.  World War II and feat  Soon after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, which began on 22 June 1941, Besikbayev was assigned to the 1st Squadron of the 207th Long-Range Bomber Aviation Regiment, part of the 42nd Long-Range Bomber Aviation Division of the 3rd Long-Range Bomber Aviation Corps on the Western Front, where he flew as rear gunner for pilot Aleksandr Maslov. On 26 June he was killed in action with the rest of the crew after Maslov attacked a German convoy on the Molodechno-Radoshkovichi highway in an Ilyushin Il-4 long-range bomber, possibly from a fire taran attack (the act of ramming a burning aircraft into the ground) initially attributed to Nikolai Gastello. The crew was initially declared missing in action by the Soviet Air Forces and were resultingly considered potential traitors. In 1951 the remains of the crew were identified not as those of the crew of Gastello, who had been declared a Hero of the Soviet Union after being credited with ramming a German tank column after his plane caught fire, but as those of the Maslov crew based on the findings of several military medals and an apartment key. However, the findings were not immediately made public due to Gastello's status as being credited as the first to lead a fire taran attack. In the late 80's and 90's many publications concluded that the first ground ramming was conducted by the Maslov crew, leading to all four crew members being posthumously awarded the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class, in 1992 and the title Hero of the Russian Federation in 1996.

Description  The Forest in Winter at Sunset was painted by French painter Th√©odore Rousseau between 1846 and 1867. The large painting (described by one source as \\"monumental\\") took years for the artist to complete; it was only at the urging of friends that Rousseau finished the scene.

Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press. This reputation is reflected in Forest; set in Fontainebleau forest during a winter sunset, Rousseau's scene features a dense thicket of foliage set beneath a sallow sky. Deep colors are employed to add depth to the painting, while the defined lines of the larger trees stand out from the more-amorphous mass of smaller plants. Given that the scene is set in the December of 1854, every branch and is bare, further adding to the character of the painting.

For sponsorship reasons, the club is known as Bir≈ºebbuƒ°a Freeport. History The club was founded in 1955. Many of the first players of the club were British servicemen. Popularity of the club and the game increased year by year, but the club did not have enough funds, and times it was difficult to honour fixtures, either due to lack of players, or lack of a venue. Sometimes the club had to play its home fixtures away from home, in neighbouring Marsaxlokk.http://www.birzebbugaasc.com/clubhistory The club's organigram was fluid in the beginning, and in order to acquire a waterpolo pitch, there need an organised set up which could take on legal responsibilities.

Background The Lynching is a one- woman, 90-minute performance, performed by Jackie Walker and written collaboratively with Norman Thomas. The production focuses on the lives of Walker's activist parents, her own struggles with racism after she came to Britain in the late 1950s, and what happened to her after the Labour Party was enveloped in an antisemitism row. Some of the material on her family also appears in her family memoir Pilgrim State, while her later experience is also covered in the film Witch Hunt. It is described as \\"the one woman show about a real-life witchhunt: an attempt to destroy Jeremy Corbyn and an entire political movement.\\" Walker described her treatment by the media as a \\"political lynching\\" designed \\"to smash the most radical political movement we have ever seen\\". Walker adds: \\"This show is my chance to tell my side of the story.\\" Overview In the show, Walker plays a number of characters including her Jewish communist father, arriving as a refugee in New York around 1918, and her Jamaican-born black civil rights activist mother. Imagining herself on trial for antisemitism, she adopted the character of her mother to put the case for the defence. Tour The Lynching had its premiere at Edinburgh Festival Fringe on 4 August 2017. Reception In August 2017, the Board of Deputies of British Jews wrote to Edinburgh Council to request that the show be banned from council owned premises. Alexei Sayle wrote in The Guardian, \\"Jackie possesses a lovely singing voice and the honed acting skills of a veteran performer, plus the tragic story of her Jewish civil rights campaigner father and her black Jamaican mother, who was wrongly confined to a mental institution in the US, is worth a show in itself. Jackie is also very funny and frank about her own bolshy nature.\\" Linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky said: \\"I wholeheartedly support the right of anyone to criticise Israel without being branded antisemitic. That goes in particular for Jackie Walker\\". Lee Levitt of The Jewish Chronicle said the show is an attempt \\"justify the views that have made her a controversial figure\\" and that the opening of her Edinburgh Fringe performance was \\"greeted by cheers and a standing ovation\\". In the Morning Star, Bernadette Hyland described it as \\"a story which Walker brings to life using song and readings\\" and \\"a shocking and sorrowful narrative as we follow her mother and siblings from the US to Jamaica and finally to Britain\\". Camden New Journal said of the play, \\"Billed as a story of black struggle, racism and Jeremy Corbyn, it mixes politics, humour, drama and song, The Lynching invites the audience-as-jury to hear Jackie‚Äôs mother defend her daughter.\\" Ben Fishwick of The News said, \\"Ms Walker's show, The Lynching, sees the audience act as a jury while her mother 'comes to life' defending her actions.\\" John Gulliver of The Islington Tribune \\"found it absorbing and revealing\\".

She enjoyed great popularity and was one of the most famed actresses in Sweden in the mid 19th-century. Life Charlotte Lindmark was the daughter of a poor milliner. She made her stage debut in the Children's theater of Anders Selinder. She became a student of the Royal Swedish Ballet in 1829 and ballerina in 1834. She was a popular and talented ballerina, but was affected by gout to such a degree that she was forced to retire in 1839. She made her debut as an actress at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, and was regarded to have displayed good talent, but was not considered to live up to the expectations. From 1845 until her death, she was engaged as an actress at the Mindre teatern, a theater more frequented by the wider public than the royal stage and where she enjoyed great and widespread popularity among both audience and critics.

As with other species in genus Goniopora, it has the common names 'flowerpot coral' and 'daisy coral'. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categorises its status as near threatened.  Description  Goniopora stokesi is found widely across the northern Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. In roughly clockwise order: from Madagascar and the Gulf of Aden in the west, through the Maldives and southern India, through the East Indies, up to Japan, and down to northern parts of Western Australia, and to the Great Barrier Reef in the east. This citation includes an excellent collection of photographs. It has been described as usually uncommon but conspicuous, but sometimes locally common. It has been reported at depths of , less commonly at . It is usually free-living; that is, not attached to a fixed substrate. Colonies are often found on sandy bottoms, in turbid and relatively still waters. They are usually hemispherical, and often have satellite (daughter) colonies which have not yet budded off. Goniopora stokesi has a reputation among aquarists both of being readily available commercially, and of being difficult to maintain in The aquarium trade may be one reason why the species is under threat. The specific epithet stokesi may be in honour of Charles Stokes ( - 1853), a respected English amateur malacologist. It would be necessary to consult the original paper describing the species (which does not seem to have been digitised) to settle the matter.

The original agreement tied together the water systems of Hartford, Bloomfield, Newington, Wethersfield, and Windsor. The MDC currently serves eight towns in the Hartford area. The MDC is run by a 29-member board of commissioners; 17 of which are appointed by the member towns, eight by the governor, and four by legislative leaders. The current Chairman of the MDC Board is William A. DiBella. History The Nepaug Dam Spill way of Saville Dam Barkhamsted The MDC began acquiring land for the planned Barkhamsted Reservoir two and a half years before its charter was granted. in 1932 under Chairman Charles Goodwin the MDC was forced to slow its land acquisition as a result of the great depression. In the 21st century the MDC has faced criticism for opaque business practices and offering deep discounts to select industrial users without public consultation. Regulators at PURA have suggested increased transparency and external audits in addition to the MDC's own. In 2017 the MDC began work on The South Hartford Conveyance and Storage Tunnel, the largest project in the District's history. The 18 ft diameter tunnel will extend four miles at a depth of over 200 ft and will carry stormwater during significant rain events, this project is the cornerstone of a larger sewer-stormwater separation project aimed at improving water quality in Wethersfield Cove, the Connecticut River, and Long Island Sound. The South Hartford Conveyance and Storage Tunnel project has an estimated budget of over $500 million. Reservoirs Woods of Rochambeau campsite in West Hartford, August 27, 2008 Lake Mcdonough from Tunxis Trail The Barkhamsted Reservoir was created with the completion of the Saville Dam on the Farmington River. The Barkhamsted Reservoir has a filled volume of 36.8 billion US gallons (139,000,000 m3) and is the largest impoundment on the Farmington River system. The reservoir was completed in 1940 at a cost of $10 million. Filling the reservoir destroyed much of the town of Barkhamsted Hollow. Water from the Barkhamstead Reservoir is transferred by pipes to filtration stations in West Hartford and Bloomfield using only the force of gravity. The West Hartford Reservoirs are a series of five reservoirs and a number of ponds and water tanks in West Hartford, Connecticut.

According to the MDC use of its facilities is \\"regulated by the Connecticut Department of Public Health (Section 24-43c of the Connecticut General Statutes) and enforced by MDC police.\\" The current Chief of Police of The MDC Police is Henry Martin. In 2011 CEO Charles Sheehan stated that Metropolitan District Officers operate both in uniform and in plain clothes, and that they maintain order at the MDC's corporate headquarters in addition to the field facilities. Controversies Niagara Bottling Plant In 2015 the MDC faced criticism over a deal with Niagara Bottling that provided the first bulk discount since the District began operating. They kept the deal secret until after it had been completed and did not offer a chancellor public comment. The Bloomfield Town Council faced criticism for not consulting or notifying the public of the bottling plant, and a significant tax abatement, until after the deal was made. There have been calls for increased transparency. In 2016 the MBD Board voted to discontinue the Niagara discount, the change was part of an effort to restore public trust after the scandal over secrecy and lack of public oversight. Chairman DiBella In 2008 MDC Chairman William A. DiBella was ordered to pay $795,000 in restitution for his key role in a fraudulent investment scheme involving former State Treasurer Paul J. Silvester and Thayer Capital Partners. DiBella and his associates were paid kickbacks from Thayer in return for placing money from the Connecticut State Retirement and Trust Fund into their funds. The scheme unbalanced the State Retirement and Trust Fund portfolio, potentially putting a huge number of State Retirement accounts at risk. DiBella was MDC Chairman at the time and there have been widespread calls for him to step down, mainly citing his SEC case, the ethics of public office, and the inherent moral corruption of his acts leading to questions about his character. The Federation of Connecticut Taxpayer Organizations has added DiBella to their ‚ÄúHall of Shame‚Äù of politicians who grossly betray the public's trust in addition to calling for him to be stripped of his MDC position. Fellow MDC Commissioner Mark Pappa stated that ‚ÄúIf this was a publicly traded company this conversation wouldn‚Äôt even happen because there‚Äôs no question Mr. DiBella would not be sitting here.‚Äù Discrimination lawsuits In 2002 the MDC paid $1.5m to settle claims of discrimination against female and minority employees. MDC Chairman William A. DiBella claimed that the settlement was a result of \`\`The district wanted to get this behind them.‚Äô‚Äô A jury in 2000 had awarded the plaintiff, Sharon Harper, $4.6m after finding that MDC officials had defamed her. The Officials spread rumors about Harper that were of a sexual nature and the jury found them to be on their face defamatory, this was seen as highly offensive to Harper because she was a Churchgoer with a conservative southern background. This was the third time in eight years that the MDC was found to be at fault for discriminating against minority employees. Despite the communities it serves being highly diverse the Hartford Courant in 2002 classified the senior management of the MDC as \\"overwhelmingly white.‚Äù In 2016 the MDC paid $350,000 to settle the case Lebert Thomas v. The Metropolitan District et al. It was alleged that the MDC discriminated against Mr. Thomas on the basis of his race. A confidentiality clause was included with the settlement.

While the societies shared the name and functions, they were independent of each other. The Lithuanian American society was established in 1900 by a group of priests and was active until 1945. Lithuanian priests copied the example and established Motinƒólƒó in Kaunas in 1903. This society was active until 1932. Both societies supported over 120 Lithuanian students, many of whom later became prominent figures in Lithuanian politics, science, culture, and Catholic church. Lithuanian American society The idea of a charitable society to support Catholic-minded students was raised by Lithuanian students at the University of Fribourg. They published an appeal in the Lietuva newspaper in Chicago. A group of Lithuanian priests, including , Antanas Milukas, , responded to the appeal and established Motinƒólƒó in Pittston, Pennsylvania. Initially, it had broad goals of supporting Lithuania's independence from the Russian Empire, raising Lithuanian national consciousness, pursuing freedom of the press and religion, and providing financial aid to Lithuanian students and to those who suffered for serving Lithuanian causes. The society had about 200 members (mostly priests) and received most of its income from annual dues that were about $10 (). It was also supported by priests in Lithuania, including the Tƒóvynƒós sargas newspaper. The society became virtually inactive in 1926, but was reestablished in 1932. It was disestablished in 1945. Motinƒólƒó was most active in providing scholarships to Lithuanian university students who studied at various universities of Europe, including the University of Fribourg, Moscow Imperial University, University of Krak√≥w. In 1900‚Äì1926, the society distributed $14,000 () in scholarships. In total, it supported 43 students, including composers Stasys ≈†imkus and , writers Marija Peƒçkauskaitƒó (pen name ≈†atrijos Ragana) and Vincas Mykolaitis-Putinas, Prime Minister Pranas Dovydaitis, philosopher Stasys ≈†alkauskis, bishops Vincentas Boriseviƒçius and Jurgis Matulaitis, painters Vytautas Kairi≈´k≈°tis and Adomas Varnas, priest and poet Motiejus Gustaitis, priest and historian Jonas Totoraitis. Kaunas society Initially, due to the various Russification policies, the society in Lithuania was illegal and little is known of its first few years. It is believed that it was established in summer 1903. It was supported by Lithuanian priests, including Adomas Dambrauskas-Jak≈°tas, Jonas Maƒçiulis- Maironis, Kazimieras Steponas ≈†aulys, Juozas Tumas-Vai≈ægantas, Pranci≈°kus B≈´ƒçys, Jonas Totoraitis. They supported linguist Kazimieras B≈´ga, writers Marija Peƒçkauskaitƒó (pen name ≈†atrijos Ragana) and . When it became possible to register Lithuanian societies, seven Lithuanians from Panevƒó≈æys, including linguists Jonas Jablonskis and Juozas Balƒçikonis, submitted an official request to register the Motinƒólƒó Society in August 1906. The Governor of Kaunas officially approved the registration on 27 January 1907. The founding meeting, attended by 34 people, took place on 21 February and elected the first board (chairman Adomas Dambrauskas-Jak≈°tas, treasurer Kazimieras Steponas ≈†aulys, and secretary , later members included Juozapas Skvireckas and ). In 1909, the society added a three-member audit committee (first members were Juozapas Skvireckas, Konstantinas Ol≈°auskas, and Pranci≈°kus Turauskas, later members included Jonas Maƒçiulis-Maironis, Juozas Tumas- Vai≈ægantas, Vladas Jurgutis). It was inactive during World War I, but was reestablished in April 1918. In 1919, it raised the idea of establishing a special fund for publishing thesis and dissertations of Lithuanian students. The idea was supported by Stasys ≈†alkauskis, Edvardas Turauskas, and Leonas Bistras, but remained unrealized. The society's activities diminished in 1920s and it was officially liquidated on 8 October 1932 due to inactivity. The membership dues were set at 10 rubles and later 10 litas (increased to 15 litas in 1925) per month. The society had 94 members in 1909 and 100 members in 1913. Vast majority of them were priests, including Justinas Staugaitis, Jurgis Matulaitis, . After the war, more non-clergy members joined the society. In addition to the membership dues, the society collected various other donations and bequests. For example, Bishop left 1,000 rubles in his last will, priest Pranci≈°kus Strak≈°as donated securities worth 10,000 rubles, farmer Povilas Vidugiris donated 3,000 rubles. Some former aid recipients repaid their support so that other students could benefit. Until 1924, the society supported at least 84 students. The largest sums were paid to linguists Kazimieras B≈´ga and Juozas Balƒçikonis, diplomat Kazys Bizauskas, and physician Eliziejus Draugelis. Other recipients included politicians Leonas Bistras and Mykolas Krupaviƒçius, bishop Vincentas Boriseviƒçius, professor Pranas Dovydaitis, President Aleksandras Stulginskis, diplomat Eduardas Turauskas, painter Adomas Varnas, sculptor Juozas Zikaras, composer , Minister of the Interior .

It was used by the Italian Army during both the First World War and Second World War. History After the independence and unification of Italy, the Italians were not self- sufficient in arms design and production. Foreign firms such as Armstrong, Krupp, Schneider, and Vickers all provided arms and helped establish local production of their designs under license. Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Italian Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Fortresses, armories, coastal fortifications, and museums were scoured for heavy artillery and sent to the front. Suitable field and rail carriages were built for these guns in an effort to give their forces the heavy field artillery needed to overcome trenches and hardened concrete fortifications. Design * Mortaio da 260/9 S - This was the original Schneider design supplied to the Italian Army. It had a steel box trail carriage, a recoil spade, two wooden spoked wheels with steel rims, a gun shield, a hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism, a Schneider interrupted screw breech, it fired cased separate-loading ammunition with up to eight bagged charges to vary velocity and range. The box trail carriage had a large hollow section near the breech to allow for high angle fire and like other large Schneider guns, there was an integrated loading tray attached to the breech. Its combat weight was and for transport, it could be broken down into two wagon loads. The barrel could be removed and moved on its own wagon load, while the second wagon load consisted of the carriage and a limber to support the tail of the carriage. On carriage, traverse was only 6¬∞. Although the Italian classification lists the mortar as being 9 calibers in length it is actually 10.5 calibers. The Italian classification system didn't count the breech length like most other countries. *Mortaio da 260/9 Modello 16 - This was the simplified design built in Italy in 1916. The gun barrel was the same but in action, the wheels were removed and the carriage formed a firing platform. The mortar could be transported in one piece and a detachable set of wooden spoked wheels with steel rims could be attached to the front of the carriage. The barrel could then be retracted rearward and laid on top of the trail for transport. The tail of the carriage was then supported by a limber for towing. Towing speed was and set up time was 24 hours. On carriage traverse was increased to 12¬∞, but performance stayed the same. The German classification for the mortar was 26 cm Mrs 582(i).

She was married to Johan Peter Str√∂mberg (1773‚Äì1834) and active with him in Norway, where the couple both made a pioneer contribution within their fields. Biography Maria Christina Str√∂mberg was a student of Louis Gallodier at the Royal Swedish Ballet in Stockholm. She was not given a position at the Royal Swedish Opera, but was employed in smaller theatre companies touring Sweden. She is known to have both performed as a dancer, as well as an actress. In Norrk√∂ping in 1797, she married Johan Peter Str√∂mberg, after which she followed him in the theatre companies in which he was employed. She was engaged in the theatre company of her spouse, and thus in the pioneer theatres he attempted to establish in Uddevalla in 1798‚Äì99, and in Nyk√∂ping in 1800‚Äì02. Between 1802 and 1811, the couple toured Norway, where there was yet no established professional theatre activity. She and her husband gave lessons in dance and drama in Trondheim (1803‚Äì05), in Kristiansund (1804‚Äì05) and in Det Dramatiske Selskab in Oslo (1806‚Äì09); she instructed the female students, while her husband instructed the male students. While ballet dance as well as dance instructions had been offered previously in Norway (by Madame Stuart), Maria Christina Str√∂mberg was possibly the first woman with confirmed formal ballet training to do so. In 1817‚Äì21, the Str√∂mberg couple resided in Gothenburg, where she was active as a dance instructor. They returned to Norway in 1822. Between 1826‚Äì27, her husband founded and managed the first permanent professional theatre in Norway, Christiania Offentlige Theater. Maria Christina Str√∂mberg died of the cholera.

He had been the party's leader since November 1916, following the expulsion of Billy Hughes and his supporters during the split over conscription. His deputy and assumed successor, T. J. Ryan, had died a few months earlier on 1 August 1921. Matthew Charlton, who had already acted as deputy leader on several occasions, was formally chosen as Ryan's replacement on 29 September. He served as acting leader on a number of occasions when Tudor's health forced his absence. On 25 January, following Tudor's state funeral, Charlton was chosen unanimously as leader of the Labor Party in the House of Representatives. He thus became Leader of the Opposition. The overall leadership of the party was left vacant until parliament resumed, but Charlton was the de facto party leader. On 16 May, the party formally elected Charlton as its leader. Albert Gardiner, the party's sole senator, was the only other candidate, attracting only 2 votes to Charlton's 22.

The Atlas of Living Australia shows a record from New South Wales. In 2015 a sighting from China was reported. It has bold black blobs on its rear, perhaps mimicking eyes. In 2014 Carly Brooke Martinetti gave it the common name \\"Alien Butt Spider\\" by which it became internationally known. Due to its memorable common name and strange appearance photographs of the spider have appeared in many online blogs and galleries. Description and taxonomy Both males ( body length 5 mm) and females (7 mm) of Araneus praesignis have large black decorations on the upper rear (dorsal posterior) of the abdomen, thought to be a case of Batesian mimicry where an animal has markings making it appear larger and more threatening than it really is. The spider was described by Ludwig Koch in Die Arachniden Australiens, 1872. Biology Araneus praesignis shelters during the day in a silk-bound retreat made in a non- fully-closed leaf nearby where its web is erected at night. Its food is night- flying insects and other invertebrates. It is harmless to humans and can be handled by people without medical consequences although allergic reactions may be possible.

A member of the National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, he conducted influential research into concepts of reward and nonreward in learning and behavior. Later, his research shifted from learning theory to neurobiology. Early life Amsel was born in Montreal, Quebec on December 4, 1922. He earned undergraduate and master's degrees in psychology from Queen's University (1944) and McGill University (1946), respectively. He completed his Ph.D. at the University of Iowa, where his mentor was learning and motivation researcher Kenneth Spence, who had been a prot√©g√© of Clark L. Hull at Yale University. Shortly after he finished the Ph.D., Amsel completed research that expanded upon the Hull-Spence theory of learning and motivation. Career Amsel noted a phenomenon that he called frustrative nonreward in which a subject is expecting a reward but does not receive one. In this circumstance, nonreward becomes aversive. He presented his findings on frustrative nonreward at a conference in 1951. They were based on finding a frustration effect (FE) with rats in a double-runway: faster running after reward omission at the beginning of the second runway. Psychological Review rejected the ideas for publication, with one reviewer noting that he was loath \\"to revive Hullian theory\\". Seven years later, the paper was published in Psychological Bulletin, where it had become the journal's second-most cited paper by the late 1980s. Amsel wrote a book on the concept, Frustration Theory: An Analysis of Dispositional Learning and Memory. An alternative account of the FE, now termed the omission effect and supported subsequently by a series of experiments, was presented by Staddon and Innis in 1966,Staddon, J. E. R., & Innis, N. K. (1966). An effect analogous to ‚Äúfrustration‚Äù on interval reinforcement schedules. Psychonomic Science, 4, 287-288.Temporal effects of reinforcement: A negative ‚Äúfrustration‚Äù effect. Learning and Motivation, 1, 227-247.Staddon, J. E. R. (1974). Temporal control, attention and memory. Psychological Review, 81, 375-391. and the topic rather faded from the animal-learning literature. Later in his career, Amsel's research interests evolved from learning theory toward neurobiology as he worked to understand developmental differences in his young and mature rat subjects. Amsel held faculty appointments at Newcomb College (1948‚Äì60), the University of Toronto (1960-69) and the University of Texas at Austin (1969‚Äì99). Amsel replaced Spence at Texas after the latter died of cancer. He conducted research that clarified the role of nonreward and frustration on classical conditioning. Amsel founded the journal Animal Learning & Behavior in 1973; it is now known as Learning & Behavior. He was elected chairman of the board of the Psychonomic Society in 1978. He became a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1951 and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1992. He died of Alzheimer's disease in Austin on August 31, 2006. Amsel was survived by his wife Tess and their children. Amsel had a Jaguar in his garage for many years; he said that the smell of the leather reminded him of when he was dating Tess.

After the discovery of copper ore in the area in the 17th century, exploration for ore started in the 18th century. The copper works in K√•fjord operated from 1826 to 1878 under English owners, and again from 1896 to 1909 under Swedish owners.  1826‚Äì1878: Alten Copper Mines / Alten Copper Works  John Rice Crowe (1795‚Äì1877) and Henry Dick Woodfall (1796‚Äì1869) founded Alten Copper Mines, probably in 1826, to extract copper ore in the Alta area. Crowe had started trading in Hammerfest around 1820. Crowe and Woodfall both acted as directors of the company in K√•fjord, which changed its name to Alten Copper Works after some time. Operations started in 1826 with 11 workers from the R√∏ros Copper Works. On May 17, 1827, Maret Aslaksdatter from Dullan in K√•fjord signed a contract whereby she transferred to John Rice Crowe the right to exploit the copper ore deposits found at K√•fjord. In return, she received 50 v√•ger (about ) of whole-grain rye flour in payment. Some sources also state that she received a small pension paid by the copper works. John Rice Crowe also had interests in copper works outside of Alta. In 1827, together with merchants from Hammerfest and Troms√∏, he founded the Quenangen Mining Association to start mining in Kv√¶nangen in Troms. Individual mines The \\"Big Mine\\" (Storgruva) in K√•fjord, which was located above Str√∏msnes, was also called the Marit Mine (Maritgruva) in memory of Maret Aslaksdatter. The four other mines that were set up in K√•fjord by 1827 were named after stakeholders in the copper works: the Woodfall Mine (Woodfalls gruve), Crowe Mine (Crowes gruve), Ward Mine (Wards gruve), and Nellen Mine (Nellens gruve). All of these were in the mountains above K√•fjord. The Raipa Mine (Raipas gruve) is located on a ridge known as Lille-Raipas and is believed to have been opened in 1685. Two men from Alta presented two ore samples at a meeting in S√∏r√∏ya in that year, and the description of the site indicates that the samples came from Raipas. Alten Copper Works operated the mine from 1836 to 1869. The Raipas Mine and the \\"Old Mine\\" (Gammelgruva) in K√•fjord were the two most important mines for the copper works in K√•fjord. 1826‚Äì1844: The first decades In its first few years, the copper works in K√•fjord was the only one in Norway without its own smelting hut. This is because the owners were uncertain whether the enterprise would pay off at all and therefore would not invest in a smelting hut. Instead, the ore was sent to the United Kingdom for smelting, with the stipulation that the crude material be crushed and carefully sorted in advance so as not to transport too much stone in relation to copper. Initially, the ore was transported by horse from the crushing facility to the harbor, but in 1828 a railway line was built from the crushing facility to the sea. With this, the Alten Copper Works established the northernmost rail line in the world. Woodfall resigned from his executive position at the Alten Copper Works in 1840. Crowe remained the director until 1844, when his successor Stephen Henry Thomas took over. Unlike Woodfall and Crowe, Thomas had a mining education; he was a chemical engineer and a few years earlier had relocated from Cornwall to become the mining foreman in K√•fjord. Thomas served as the director from 1844 to 1857, and he was the first foreign citizen to be elected to a seat in the Storting. The Alten Copper Mines was Norway's largest iron and copper works in 1840 by number of employees. At the same time, K√•fjord was the largest settlement in Finnmark. In the 1835 census, K√•fjord had a population of 655, or 388 Norwegians (including Swedes), 253 women, 12 Englishmen, and two Germans. As the co-director of the Alten Copper Works, Woodfall was skeptical of Crowe's proposal to select miners from England to operate the mine in Alta. He worried that imported skilled workers would come into conflict with the Norwegian and Swedish workers. Nonetheless, eight miners were brought in from Cornwall. The English workers had been promised higher wages than the local workers, and when they arrived at K√•fjord they demanded additional wage increases because they felt that the operating conditions were particularly challenging. Woodfall and Crowe eventually concluded that it was too expensive to use English workers, and six of them were returned to Cornwall in September 1827. Suggestions were later made to bring back English professionals, but Woodfall remained opposed to imported labor. Instead, over the years he made several trips to the mines at R√∏ros and Folldal to recruit people. He wanted the new workers to bring their wives and children to K√•fjord so that they would settle there permanently. Under these circumstances, the company would also have to pay the travel expenses for the workers' families, but Woodfall considered this a necessary long-term investment to establish a permanent mining community in K√•fjord. In this way, there would be better prospects for the workers to remain in K√•fjord, and the local labor force would increase in the long run. For the same reason, Woodfall primarily wanted to hire workers that had no debt to repay at their previous residence; many people sought work at K√•fjord only to make money to pay off their farms at home and they would return to their farms as soon as they had become debt free. When such workers left K√•fjord, the copper works had to recruit and train new workers, and this limited the effectiveness of its production. The mining community had its own shop (opened in 1829), school (built in 1829), and church (consecrated in 1837). The workers lived in log houses owned by the company, usually housing one family. Kvens were housed separately at Kreta () at the outflow of the Mathis River into the fjord, where the Kven children also had their own school for a few years. A bridge was built across the Inner Strait (Innerstr√∏mmen) in 1836 so that the Kven would not have to rely on a boat to get to work. Crowe and Woodfall brought the philanthropic factory tradition from their homeland, which involved not only putting people to work but also ensuring their welfare. They took care of widows of factory workers and their families, and in K√•fjord they built a small industrial community based on the English model with their own homes and a health center for the employees. The factory operated its own grocery store with its own bakery and brewery. There were also free schools, one for the children from Kreta with instruction in Kven, and one in K√•fjord for the Norwegians. In 1861 it was decided in Norway that no one should be taught in Kven. Nonetheless, this was still done in the lower and upper grades. In the works' civic building, Ultima Thule was founded as the world's northernmost theater company, with seating for 200 people, in 1840. The plays were performed in English, but there was a full house every time a new performance was staged. When Crowe left K√•fjord in 1845, the theater performances ended and the venue was later used as a party venue. The building also contained a library with a reading rooms for the workers, with everything from classical literature to new journals on science and technology. 1844‚Äì1878: The last decades The company's new director, Stephen Henry Thomas, joined in 1844. In contemporary documents he is referred to as the manager of the works. He was originally from Cornwall, was educated as a chemical engineer, and had been the mining foreman at the K√•fjord works since the 1830s. He was as involved with his employees as his predecessors Woodfall and Crowe had been. Alta Church was built based on plans that he made, and this is a strong indication that he had designed K√•fjord Church a few years earlier. However, copper prices fell on the world market, and the Quenangen Mining Association, which had been launched in 1827 by John Rice Crowe, was increasingly experiencing economic problems. At the end of the 1840s, this company sold the mines in Kv√¶nangen to Alten Copper Mines, but the Kv√¶nangen plant remained a separate company until 1857, when the two works were formally merged into one company. Thomas left Alten Copper Mines in 1857, when he went to Chile to become director general of the Copiapo Smelting Company. The year before, he had become the first foreigner to be elected a representative of the Storting. Activity at the copper works continued to fluctuate in line with international copper prices. In the 1860s prices dropped drastically, and operations at the copper works tapered off. Alten Copper Mines was shut down in 1878. 1896‚Äì1909: New operation with Swedish owners The company Alten Copper Mines was merged with Sulitjelma Aktiebolag in 1896. The operations in K√•fjord were resumed with Swedish owners under the name Alten Kobbergruver the same year. Then the copper works in K√•fjord were modernized. The smelting hut was torn down and an electric power station was set up on the M√∏llnes River (M√∏llneselva) in 1903. In 1909 the mines were exhausted and the operation was found to be unprofitable. Laurits A. Heitmann purchased the works' properties after the closure. 1944: Occupation forces burn K√•fjord In the fall of 1944, all of the buildings at the site except for the church were burned during the German retreat.

Opened in 1967, the property offers camping sites and a range opportunities for outdoor recreation including picnicking, swimming, canoeing, kayaking, biking, front-country hiking, walking, boat ramp, fishing, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and geocaching. Lands were initially acquired for the park in 1962, with major acquisitions occurring in 1968 and 1973. The property was designated under the Provincial Parks Act by Order in Council (OIC 84-679) on 12 June 1984. In an area of almost exclusively private properties, this park provides one of the few public access points to the Mira River. Geology The Mira River Valley is a dominant topographical feature of southeastern Cape Breton Island, extending from Framboise Cove northwards to about Marion Bridge and then sweeping eastwards to exit at Mira Bay. The river lies between 320 million year old Carboniferous formations to the north and 500 million year old Cambrian and Precambrian formations to the south. The highly eroded bedrock is covered by a thick layer of glacial till, sands and gravels deposited during the retreat of the last ice age some 15,000 years ago. Lying in a long narrow valley, possibly along an old fault line, the lower reaches of the river have been dammed by glacial gravels to form a long lake. Along the lower two-thirds of the river, these glacial deposits also formed numerous peninsulas such as the one Mira River Provincial Park occupies. About three kilometres from the mouth of the Mira, the river narrows and cuts a valley through bedrock to reach the Atlantic Ocean. Here the valley is less than wide, with banks 20 metres (65 feet) high. The carboniferous bedrock to the north of the Mira includes numerous coal seams - evidence of the area's environment 300 million years ago. At that time shallow lakes, bays, swamps and coastal flood plains covered much of the region. Abundant fossils can be found in this coal. These coal seams supported the region's long history of coal mining. South of the Mira, fossils are also imbedded in the Cambrian sandstones and shales. Marine Environment The Mira River has a drainage area of approximately , with the Gaspereau, Salmon and Trout rivers, along with Black Brook, as its main tributaries. Along the southern part of its course, glacial deposits have interrupted the flow to form a chain of small lakes which are all less than 15 metres above sea level. Tidal waters move back and forth in the eastern portion of the river, although the influx of salt water any distance beyond the river mouth is limited. The waters of the Mira River support a variety of fish species including sea trout, shad, perch, American eels, striped bass, mackerel, herring, brook trout, speckled trout, minnows and smelts. Consequently, the river is popular for fishing. Flora The forest cover of Mira River Provincial Park consists generally of tolerant hardwoods, predominantly sugar maple, on the westernmost portion near Joes Point, with a larger portion of mixed woods through the central portion and softwood stands along the western shoreline, around the maintenance yard and immediately south of the northernmost walk-in campsites. Large areas of non-forested areas are associated with the campground. A six hectare wetland is located along the northernmost shoreline. Portions of the park remain relatively undisturbed and in a region with a long history of human development provide an opportunity to explore and appreciate the area's natural heritage. Fauna Due to its small size, long history of human development and use and island-like setting, Mira River Provincial Park is home to a limited number of mammals, including snowshoe hare, red squirrels, voles, moles, bats, field mice and porcupine. Common birds which inhabit the park and surrounding woods and waters include bald eagles, loon, blue heron, Canada goose and a variety of owls, ducks and other waterfowl. Although having limited wildlife values, the park does provide some relatively natural habitat in an area of increasing human development and use. Cultural Heritage Mira River Brick Works - Kiln buildings, NS - 1910 The first inhabitants of the area were the Mi‚Äôkmaq who established seasonal camps along the river. In the early 1700s, French settlers arrived and soon began clearing the land and exporting timber, particularly white pine prized for ship masts, to France. The settlers also farmed as evidenced by the old orchards still found within the park. In 1727 the French established a brick yard here at what is now known as Brickyard Point in Mira River Provincial Park, to access the high quality of clay found along the river banks. The bricks were used to build the nearby Fortress of Louisbourg which had begun in 1719. Even today, a walk along the shore of the river will reveal hundreds of bricks that fell off the ships transporting them from the kiln to the Louisbourg construction site. By 1763 the English gained control of Cape Breton Island. While some French settlers returned to France, many others remained. Later, large numbers of United Empire Loyalists and Scottish immigrants settled in Cape Breton. The park provides an authentic setting to present the story of aboriginal use of the Mira River.

Blass was a close friend of Kurt Hiller and joined him at Der Neue Club, alongside other writers of early Expressionism, Georg Heym and Jakob van Hoddis. From 1911, he collaborated with the magazine Die Aktion, before distancing himself from Franz Pfemfert in 1914.Heinz Sch√∂ffler, Der j√ºngste Tag. Die B√ºcherei einer Epoche, Frankfort, Verlag Heinrich Scheffler, 1970 In Das Wesen der neuen Tanzkunst (The essence of the new dance art) Blass set out to identify abstract categories whereby \\"a new dance art\\" could be outlined. He described how the anthroposophical breathing methods taught at Loheland could transform the \\"marionette\\" into an animal form which could then leap in an ecstatic manner. In this he was responding to previous theories of dance, such as produced by Heinrich von Kleist who had written in 1807 a short text \\"√úber dem Marionette Theater\\" according to which the dancer became a marionnette without either will or consciousness. In 1980 Thomas B. Schumann published a three volume collection of Blass' poetry (Volume 1), short stories (Volume 2) and various essays(Volume 3).

As a two-year-old, she was named the Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Filly after winning the Mazarine and Demoiselle Stakes. At age three, in addition to beating the colts twice in Canada, she was second in the Grade I Kentucky Oaks to Monomoy Girl. She was named the 2018 Canadian Horse of the Year and Champion Three-Year-Old Filly.  Background  Wonder Gadot is a dark bay filly bred in Ontario by Anderson Farms. Her sire is Medaglia d'Oro, who won four Grade I races during his racing career, including the Travers Stakes in 2002 and the 2003 Whitney Handicap. He was also the runner-up in the 2002 Belmont Stakes and the 2004 Dubai World Cup. Medaglia d'Oro was retired to stud in 2005 and became a successful stallion who finished second on the American general sires list in 2015 and has finished in the top ten five other times. His other major runners include Rachel Alexandra, Songbird, Plum Pretty, Bolt d'Oro, Mshawish, Violence, and Vancouver. Wonder Gadot's dam Loving Vindication raced from 2007 to 2010, primarily in allowance company. She won two of her 13 races; one a victory in a maiden special weight at Belmont Park and the other an allowance win at Saratoga. In January 2011, she sold as a broodmare prospect to Anderson Farms for $180,000. Loving Vindication's first foal, a full brother to Wonder Gadot named Solemn Tribute, is a stakes winner who won the Tropical Park Derby in 2015 and finished second in the King Edward Stakes in 2016. Loving Vindication has also produced a 2016 Hard Spun filly named Hard Not To Love, who is in race training as of June 2018, a 2017 colt by Bodemeister, and a 2018 filly by Nyquist. As a yearling, Anderson Farms sold Wonder Gadot at Keeneland September for $80,000 to Eisaman Equine. She was then pinhooked, or re-sold for a higher price, at the Ocala Breeders' Sale in April 2018. Gary Barber, former chairman and CEO of MGM, purchased her for $325,000 and sent her into training with Mark Casse, a member of the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. Wonder Gadot is named for the actress Gal Gadot, who played Wonder Woman in the 2017 film of the same name.  Racing career   2017: two- year-old season  Wonder Gadot's career debut was at Woodbine Racetrack on August 26, 2017. In an unusual first step, Wonder Gadot was not entered in a maiden special weight for her first race, but an allowance race against fillies who had raced before. In the seven-furlong turf race, Wonder Gadot stalked the pace set by 32-1 longshot Without a Doubt, overtaking her entering the stretch and drawing away to win by four lengths. Wonder Gadot made her next start in the Grade I Natalma Stakes, run at a distance of one mile on the turf. She went off as the 2-1 favorite in a field of nine that included fillies from Canada, America and Europe. At the start, Golden Orb bumped into Capla Temptress, who in turn bumped into Wonder Gadot. Wonder Gadot then settled in midpack for the first half mile before making her move around the final turn. However, she could not match the finishing kick of Capla Temptress and finished third. On October 7, Wonder Gadot went off as the even-money favorite in a field of four in the Mazarine Stakes. Running for the first time on Woodbine's Tapeta (artificial dirt) surface, she went straight to the early lead and set an easy pace. Down the stretch, she drew away from the field to win by six lengths. Jockey Patrick Husbands commented that though she was more relaxed on the turf, \\"she's the real deal\\" on the main track. The win encouraged her connections to enter her in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies at Del Mar Racetrack on November 4. After racing far back early, she encountered traffic problems and could only finish sixth. On December 2, she bounced back to win the Demoiselle Stakes on the main track at Aqueduct Racetrack by lengths after stalking the early pace. \\"I was happy where she put me,\\" said her new jockey, John Velazquez. \\"She was going very comfortable and got away from the horses pretty easily. She has a beautiful stride. I was very happy with the way she did it.\\" With her record of three wins (each coming on a different track surface) and a third from five starts, Wonder Gadot won the Sovereign Award for Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Filly.  2018: three- year-old season  Wonder Gadot began her three-year-old career in the United States, attempting to qualify on the Road to the Kentucky Oaks, the filly's equivalent of the Kentucky Derby. Although she was winless in her four prep races, she was consistently in the money, finishing second in the Silverbulletday and Fantasy, and third in the Rachel Alexandra and Fair Grounds Oaks. In the Kentucky Oaks, Wonder Gadot stalked the early pace then dueled down the stretch with Monomoy Girl, closing at one point to within a head of the lead. Nearing the finish line, the two fillies bumped repeatedly, causing Wonder Gadot to switch leads. Monomoy Girl crossed the finish line a half length in front and the stewards decided to let the results stand. \\"I think it was going to be really close,\\" said Casse. \\"But I think the stewards made the right call. To take a horse down in this type of race, I think it has to be pretty significant. As much I would have liked to have won, I understand the ruling.\\" On June 9, Wonder Gadot returned to Woodbine Oaks to contest the Woodbine Oaks, Canada's most prestigious race for three-year-old fillies. She went off as the 2-5 favorite. She broke poorly and settled well back, then made a wide move on the far turn to move into contention. However, Dixie Moon got a \\"great trip\\" along the rail and held off Wonder Gadot down the stretch to win by a head. Prior to the Queen's Plate, Casse opted to put blinkers on Wonder Gadot in order to help her focus after several narrow losses. \\"It's tough to make that kind of call,\\" said Casse. \\"Finally we just said, 'Look we've got to do it.' She has been so unlucky but she's so tough.\\" Complicating matters, the area surrounding Woodbine Racetrack was under an extreme heat warning with temperatures of and a humidex of . Casse told Barber before the race that \\"[the heat] will help her, because it's going to affect others, but it's not going to affect her.\\" In the Queen's Plate, Wonder Gadot was the 3‚Äì1 second choice on the morning line, going off at post time as the 2-1 favorite. Breaking from post 11, she tracked the pace set by stablemate Telekinesis from mid-pack and began to close ground around the far turn. Entering the stretch, Wonder Gadot took the lead and drew away to win by lengths over 28‚Äì1 longshot Aheadbyacentury. With her victory, she became the fourth filly in eight years to win the Queen's Plate. Following the race, Casse took care to cool down Wonder Gadot, fearing that she was having trouble catching her breath in the extreme heat. He compared her to 2014 Queen's Plate winner Lexie Lou, whom he also trained. \\"She reminds me a lot of Lexie Lou even though she probably weighs 200 pounds more than Lexie did but Lexie just thrived on running,\\" he said. \\"There are horses that will just run and run and run and luckily this is one of them.\\" He also stated that he was considering running Wonder Gadot in the Prince of Wales Stakes, the second leg of the Canadian Triple Crown, alongside Flameaway, a horse who previously ran in the 2018 Kentucky Derby. Ultimately, Wonder Gadot made her next start in the Prince of Wales as Casse's sole entry in the six-horse race. Casse was concerned that Wonder Gadot would not be able to handle the sloppy track making her first start at Fort Erie Race Track and seriously considered scratching her from the race. However, he opted to keep her in and she was sent off as the 2-5 favorite. Wonder Gadot broke well and went out to an early lead, and was pressured by Cooler Mike on the backstretch while the remainder of the field lagged behind. On the far turn, Wonder Gadot began to open up a solid lead and was not seriously challenged in the stretch, winning by lengths over second choice Aheadbyacentury. Casse and Barber's original plan was for Wonder Gadot to run in the Alabama Stakes on August 18, the same day as the Breeders' Stakes, the final leg of the Canadian Triple Crown. Following Wonder Gadot's Prince of Wales win, Casse said the possibility of a Canadian Triple Crown attempt was something he would discuss with Barber. He stated that his ultimate goal was a rematch with Monomoy Girl before the end of the year and a chance at the Eclipse Award for American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly. However, on July 28, it was announced that Wonder Gadot would make her next start in the Travers Stakes on August 25, becoming the first female starter in that race since Davona Dale in 1979. She raced close to the early pace but tired in the stretch and finished last. Wonder Gadot then finished third in the Cotillion Stakes on September 22 behind Midnight Bisou and Monomoy Girl. She made her final start of the year in the Breeders' Cup Distaff on November 3, where she set the early pace before tiring in the stretch to finish ninth. At the Sovereign Award ceremony held in April 2019, Wonder Gadot was named the 2018 Canadian Horse of the Year and Champion Three-Year-Old Filly. 2019: four- year-old campaign Wonder Gadot made her four-year-old debut in an allowance race at Oaklawn Park on March 8. She raced in fifth place before starting her move on the far turn. She briefly took the lead but was passed in the stretch by Go Google Yourself and finished second. In the Apple Blossom Handicap, she instead went to the early lead but tired and finished sixth behind Midnight Bisou. In June, Casse announced that Wonder Gadot had been retired.

It is known from North America, Europe and Asia. Nomenclature The generic name Chrysochus Chevrolat in Dejean, 1836 is a conserved name. It was threatened by Eumolpus in the sense used by Kugelann in Illiger, 1798, which included Chrysomela praetiosa (now a junior synonym of Chrysochus asclepiadeus). An application to conserve Chrysochus and other names by suppressing Eumolpus Kugelann in Illiger, 1798 (modified to Illiger, 1798) was accepted by ICZN in 2012. Species There are at least 12 described species in Chrysochus. Most of these are from the Palearctic and Oriental realms, and two are from North America. * Chrysochus asclepiadeus (Pallas, 1773) ** Chrysochus asclepiadeus asiaeminoris De Monte, 1948 (Considered a synonym by Ekiz et al.

A small mutation has allowed the two North American species, C. auratus and C. cobaltinus, in particular to feed on the plant species containing cardenolides, while all other species of the genus feed on plant species without cardenolides. C. auratus and C. cobaltinus have been generally considered allopatric in distribution in North America. However, two narrow regions of sympatry between the two species have been documented in western North America, one of which is located in South- central Washington.

She was executed, being the second woman in Thai history to be executed by gunfire. She had been fired from her housekeeping and childcare job by Vichai and Jitra Srijareonsukying, a Bangkok couple with a six-year-old son. Ginggaew needed money, so her 28-year-old boyfriend, who already had a criminal record, suggested holding the boy ransom. A total of six conspirators were identified by Thai authorities: aside from Ginggaew herself they were Thongmuan Grogkoggraud, Pin Peungyard, Thongsuk Puvised (the spouse of Pin), Gasem Singhara, and Suthi Sridee. On or around 18 October 1978, Ginggaew picked up the boy from school and took him to their hideout in Nakhon Ratchasima Province in Isan. The group demanded 200,000 baht from the family, who were instructed to find a flag between the Jantuek and Pakchong railway stations and deposit a bag holding the funds there. However, it was night and the parents failed to find the flag. The kidnappers stabbed the boy and then buried him alive. To avoid being haunted by the boy's spirit, they buried him with certain ritual Thai burial goods. According to authorities, Ginggaew attempted to stop the murder, but the attempt failed. Prison employee Chavoret Jaruboon stated that there were multiple lurid newspaper accounts of dubious veracity published around the time of the murder. In his memoir, Chavoret stated, \\"She was all over the news, like some kind of film star.\\" On 12 January 1979, Ginggaew was sentenced by the Prime Minister of Thailand to death by firing squad. She was initially incarcerated at Lard Yao Prison at Klong Prem Central Prison. On 13 January 1979, she was transferred to Bang Kwang Central Prison in Nonthaburi Province for execution. After the firing squad's volley, Ginggaew was transported to the morgue. Authorities initially believed she was dead, but alerted by her screams, they discovered her in the morgue attempting to stand up. Because of Ginggaew's Situs inversus, none of the bullets pierced her heart. So, she was once again placed before the firing squad, and the second volley succeeded. Gasem and Pin also received death sentences, while a life sentence was given to Thongmuan. Suthi and Thongsuk were each given 20-year sentences. Gasem was executed at Bang Kwang the same day that Ginggaew was. Pin also required two volleys of bullets before he died.

They were used mostly to carry cargo along lakes and rivers, and as lighters to transport goods to and from moored ships. Though they resemble the Chinese sampan, they are much larger with two detachable masts with junk rigs made of woven fiber. They also possess outrigger-like platforms along the entire length of the sides, which is used by punters with barge poles when traversing shallow water. They were steered by an oar or a central rudder by a helmsman housed in a small raised platform at the stern. The entire deck is covered almost entirely in removable curving or pitched panels. Cascos were most prevalent in southern Luzon. Particularly along the Pasig River and Laguna de Bay, as well as in the Manila Bay harbor. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, they were often strung together in a train drawn by a steamship (vapor). They were used as transport ships by American troops in Laguna de Bay during the Philippine-American War. Cascos are still used today in fluvial parades. An example is during the celebrations of Our Lady of Pe√±afrancia in Naga City, Bicol.

She was the first to test the polio vaccine in Argentina. She published more than 180 works.  Early life and education  Eugenia Sacerdote de Lustig was born in Turin on 9 November 1910. In 1929, Sacerdote de Lustig decided to study medicine in Italy, at a time when women were not choosing this career. Together with her first cousin Rita Levi- Montalcini, she was one of the first four women who were not able to forget their gender as they were taught with 500 men. Career Her career was difficult; even so, she was selected as assistant professor of histology at University of Turin by professor Giuseppe Levi. With the rise of fascism, she lost her job because she was Jewish. Her husband's employers arranged for them to emigrate, with their daughter, to Argentina in 1939. In Argentina her qualifications allowed her to research but not to teach. She became the chair of histology at the University of Buenos Aires. She cultivated living cells in vitro, a technique that allows the study of different types of viruses and tumors.\\"A los 101 a√±os, muri√≥ la doctora Sacerdote de Lustig\\" La Naci√≥n, 29 November 2011. When the epidemic of poliomyelitis occurred, Sacerdote de Lustig was sent by the World Health Organization to the United States to learn about the work of the professor Jonas Salk. When she returned to Argentina, she inoculated herself in public and did the same with her children to convince the population of the benefits of the polio vaccine. Since 1989, she investigated the role of free radicals and oxidative stress in living patients with Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and Parkinson's disease, expanding the basic knowledge of neurological diseases. Sacerdote de Lustig was a researcher at CONICET and head of virology at Instituto Malbr√°n. For more than 40 years, she studied tumor cells in the Instituto de Oncolog√≠a √Ångel H. Roffo. She continued to work in the laboratory into her eighties, ceasing to do so when blindness prevented her from accurately working with a microscope. She received the 2010 Rebeca Gerschman Award for outstanding research work. There are more than 180 of her scientific publications in the records of the Institute of Oncology √Ångel H.

Based on parallax measurements obtained during the Gaia mission, it is located at a distance of about from the Sun. The system is drifting closer with a radial velocity of ‚àí2 km/s. The visible component is an A-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of A0 V. It is about 58 million years old with three times the mass of the Sun and has a high rate of spin, showing a projected rotational velocity of 170 km/s. The star is radiating 147 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 9,226 K. The system is a source for X-ray emission, which is most likely coming from the unseen companion.  Nomenclature  In the Henry Draper catalogue this system has the designation HD 161693, while it has the identifier HR 6618 in the Bright Star Catalogue.

In 1954, the style was updated to the W-series plates that ran until 1970. The format and range was WAA¬∑000 to WZZ¬∑999, continuing with the month and year allocations, with the second letter representing the year, and the third letter the month. Originally, from 1954 to 1956, there was a year tab between the state identifier, for example \\"19 TAS 54\\" for 1954. This was replaced by a registration label after 1956, resulting in plate design modifications to omit the year between the state identifier. In 1970, the W-series plates were replaced by the AA¬∑0000 to ZZ¬∑9999 series with blue lettering on a white background. The first letter represented the month of registration, A for January, C for February etc, with the result that plates such as RA-nnnn (Aug) or ZA-nnnn (Dec) were likely to be issued before BA-nnnn (Jan overflow) or DA- nnnn (Feb overflow). The letters T and X are not used as second letter character because it used with Trailers, Motorcycles, respectively. From 31 Dec 1971 this system was abandoned and unused combinations were issued beginning AA-nnnn through to FT-nnnn. From 1970 to 1976 these had the slogan TAS and from 1976 to 1998, Tasmania ‚Äì Holiday Isle. Between 1998 and 2004, the border colour switched to turquoise with the slogan Tasmania ‚Äì Your Natural State, with a coloured decal of the Tasmanian state logo in the background (a stylised thylacine prowling through reeds on a riverbank). The update started at DS 0000. In 2004, the series reverted to the original blue borders, while retaining the other 1998 revisions. On 24 February 2008, the Tasmanian Government issued a new registration plate design in the format A 00 AA. After the first letter appears the Tasmanian state logo with the slogan Tasmania ‚Äì Explore the possibilities. Tasmanian plates are manufactured by LicenSys in Brisbane. In August 2017, when the combination F 99 ZZ was reached the G 00 AA to G 99 ZZ was skipped and the next series recommenced from H 00 AA; the G-series is reserved for Tasmania government. In the illustration of older Tasmanian registration plates, the three plates on the left side from top to bottom are EN-1113 (1998‚Äì2004 issue), CO-7984 (1970‚Äì1998 issue), WYG-734 (1954 to 1970 issue, non-reflective). The plates on the right side are domestic or semi trailer as indicated by the second character \\"T\\".

Other vehicles  Government plates: from 1970, these plates were in the GT-nnnn or GV-nnnn formats, but in the 1990s this was replaced by the G-nnnnn format. Both of these designs featured red lettering with blue or green numbers. With the introduction of the new standard design in 2008, the format G-00-AA is used. The lettering and numbering on the plates is green instead of the standard blue. Trailer plates: between 1970 and 2008, the format was AT-nnnn to ZT-nnnn, then it went back to issue IT-nnnn (previously allocated to interstate trucks prior to 1987) and QT-nnnn before concluding. This style was replaced in 2008 with the current format Z 00 AA and then Y 00 AA. Tasmania Fire Service vehicles use plates in the format TFS-000, with red lettering on a white background and the TFS logo in the centre. Members of the Consular Corps Tasmania use plates with the letters CC followed by a colour depiction of the flag of the country they represent, followed by two numbers.

It was adapted from Wesley's novel by Ken Taylor and first broadcast in 1992. Set just before and during the Second World War, with an aftermath that takes place in the mid 1980s, the action begins at the Cornish country house of Helena Cuthbertson. The title is drawn from a camomile lawn between the house and the sea cliffs on which some significant events take place. Outline The production begins in August 1939, when young adults Oliver (Toby Stephens), Calypso (Jennifer Ehle), Polly (Tara Fitzgerald) and her brother Walter are visiting their disorganised Aunt Helena (Felicity Kendal) and her husband Richard Cuthbertson (Paul Eddington) in their house by the sea in Cornwall. Ten-year-old Sophy (Rebecca Hall), the daughter of Richard‚Äôs late half sister, lives with them and is delighted with the arrival of her cousins, especially Oliver. The family is often visited by the twin sons of the rector of the parish and by Max and Monika Erstweiler, a Jewish refugee couple from Austria that the rector has taken in, who are missing their only son, Pauli, reported to be in a German concentration camp. The cousins invent 'The Terror Run', a cliff path dash that they race at night by a full moon, and are joined by some of the grown ups, and Sophy is determined to run it, too. However, on a daylight practice run, a coastguard exposes himself to Sophy, with surprising results. After fighting in the Spanish Civil War, Oliver is depressed and disenchanted, but develops a crush on Calypso. She fends him off, determined to make the most of her beauty and marry a much richer man. Polly is intelligent and practical, and when the Second World War breaks out in September 1939 she joins the War Office to work for Military intelligence, while her brother Walter joins the Royal Navy, Oliver the army, and the twins the Royal Air Force. Meanwhile, Max and Monika are interned as enemy aliens. Calypso marries Hector Grant, a Scottish landowner and member of parliament, but has many affairs. The Erstweilers are released, and Helena begins an affair with Max, Richard with Monika. Walter is killed at sea, and Calypso has a son, Hamish, shortly after her London house has been hit by a bomb, with Sophy acting as midwife. Pauli Erstweiler is reported to have died in Dachau, but in fact he survives the war. In 1984, more than forty years on, the survivors meet again at the house in Cornwall for the funeral of Max Erstweiler. He became a well-known violinist and bought the house from Helena after Richard‚Äôs death.

Oliver says he has had two failed marriages to Calypso lookalikes. He and Sophy find they are both single and leave the funeral together, planning to get to know each other. The house now belongs to Pauli, who plans to redevelop it and replace the camomile lawn with a swimming pool.

Card Search, Corporation Cards of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Secretary of the Commonwealth. \\"West Holyoke Improvement League, Inc...Oct. 11, 1955‚Äì Name chg. to Rock Valley Improvement League, Inc.\\" is a neighborhood in Holyoke, Massachusetts located to the west of the city center, approximately from downtown, bordering Easthampton, Southampton, Westfield, and West Springfield. Rock Valley is historically Holyoke's second oldest village after Elmwood, with its eponymous burial ground dating to around 1777, and families having settled in the area as early as 1745. Predating the construction of the Hadley Falls Dam, it originated as the western section of the 3rd parish (\\"Ireland Parish\\") of West Springfield. Today the neighborhood contains several historic Federal and Colonial homesteads as well as modern developments adjacent to agricultural and wetland tracts. Even into the 20th century the area retained an agrarian character, but was met with concern by residents who believed their neighborhood to be falling behind the progress made by the rest of the city during its sudden industrial growth. In 1921, the West Holyoke Improvement Association was founded by a number of concerned for the purpose of representing the interests of the neighborhood before the city government. Renamed the Rock Valley Improvement League in 1955, among the issues they lobbied for was the electrification of streets lights in the area, construction of a community center, and development of new playgrounds for children. The association would hold many neighborhood dinners and events for a number of years as well, and having achieved many of the aforementioned goals fell into relative obscurity. In 1930 the area briefly gained international attention when a former supply route to Westfield built by soldiers of the 104th Infantry was dedicated in Massachusetts as the Apremont Highway in a joint ceremony between Holyoke and Westfield. The 104th was the first American military unit to receive a foreign decoration for valor and the first foreign recipients of the French Croix de Guerre, for liberating Apremont-la-For√™t in the First World War.

The street was built in 1914 in the Nicolson Pavement style and is home to the historic Roslyn Place district.  History  The land on which the current Roslyn Place sits was owned by a multitude of different owners, including J.W. Friday, until the late 1800s. By 1904 English immigrant Thomas Rodd bought the area, and the land adjacent to the southwest. Thomas Rodd emigrated from London at the age of 5, and following a short career as a naval officer during the American Civil War, he joined the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.Thomas Rodd. The Book of Prominent Pennsylvanians: A Standard Reference. Pittsburg Leader. Leader Publ., 1913. After becoming chief engineer of all lines west of Pittsburgh for the railroad company, he and his family moved to Pittsburgh in 1889.Chief Engineer Thomas Rodd, Pittsburgh Daily Post, April 14, 1900. The Rodd family quickly became members of Pittsburgh's social elite joining the Pittsburgh Club, the Duquesne Club, the Allegheny County Club, the Pittsburgh Golf Club, the University Club of Pittsburgh, the Metropolitan Club of New York, and the Chicago Club.Sport at the Links, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, July 18, 1898. Rodd was also responsible for the designing and constructing of many buildings in western Pennsylvania and the Midwest. He also designed and funded the construction of the Roslyn Place district and the street. Construction began in 1914 when the City Council passed ordinance No. 181, which approved of the plans for creation of Roslyn Place.Official Pittsburgh, No. 181, The Pittsburgh Daily Post. May 30, 1914. The street was made in the Nicolson Pavement style, which is a form of wooden block pavement. Oak blocks were used for construction of the street, resulting in around 26,000 blocks in total. The construction finished later in 1914, and the street remained in that condition for decades, only undergoing minor restorations and repairs. By the 1980s though, the street had significantly deteriorated. The city opted to undergo a significant restoration project in 1985, in which extensive repairs were made. Since then, there have only been minor repairs using surplus materials from the 1985 project. The street was nominated in January 2016 to become a City Historic Landmark by Preservation Pittsburgh.  Architecture  Roslyn Place is one of the few examples of Nicolson Pavement left in the United States. Nicolson Pavement is a street paving technique that involves creosote-soaked wooden blocks laid down, and was patented by Samuel Nicolson in 1859.The Nicolson Pavement, Samuel Nicholson, 2015 London, FB &c; LTD. The paving of wooden streets was accomplished with four different approaches, and they are each tailored to particular uses for the streets. The advantages of using wooden streets can be seen when they are compared to cobblestone and Belgian block. Cobblestones had rounded edges which made it difficult for horses to can traction, and although Belgian blocks were slightly preferable, their rounded edges also made it tough for wheels to travel over. Nicolson Pavement was not rounded, but flat, which made it easier for pedestrians, wagon wheels, and horses.Frank Grant Johnson, The Nicolson Pavement and Pavements Generally, pp. 40-44. Other benefits of Nicolson Pavement were the lower costs, the reduction of noise-level, the more humane surface for horses, and there was evidence that wherever Nicolson Pavement was laid, the rents of the buildings nearby rose by more than a third.Frank Grant Johnson, The Nicolson Pavement and Pavements Generally, pp. 69-86. Roslyn Place is the last remaining example of Nicolson Pavement in Pittsburgh, and is the only street in the United States entirely paved in accordance with the Nicolson paving techniques. Roslyn Place also featured in notable urban designer Allan Jacobs' book Great Streets where it is compared to the likes of the Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris and Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C.Allan Jacobs, Great Streets, MIT Press, 1995.

History In 1912 the Royal Navy built Wireless Telegraphy Station at Scarborough, England in 1912. At the outbreak of World War One its main responsibilities was signals intelligence. After World War One it was primarily involved with monitoring diplomatic communications. In 1932, a proposal was made to close Scarborough, and to transfer operations to Flowerdown, Hampshire; fortunately this decision was reversed and in 1935 our interception of the German Navy was restarted. At the beginning of August 1939, Y Service, the organisation responsible for intercepting enemy and neutral radio transmissions, were prepared for war. Scarborough intercepted German Naval and Naval Air communications, and controlled a Direction-Finding network. It was during this period that the civilians working in Sigint for the Admiralty became known as the Admiralty Civilian Shore Wireless Service (ACSWS), and the complement soon became a mix of both civilian and service personnel, augmented during the war years by members of the Women's Royal Naval Service. During May 1941, the station at Scarborough played a key role in the location and subsequent destruction of the German battleship Bismarck. The following is an extract from a review of ‚ÄòY Work‚Äô, written by Lt. Cmdr. WR Rodger, Officer in Charge, Scarborough, 15 November 1945: Post World War Two the Admiralty Civilian Shore Wireless Service role was monitor and collect communications of the Soviet Armed Forces a role it maintained through the cold war period. In 1965 the Admiralty Civilian Shore Wireless Service's role and functions was amalgamated within Government Communications Headquarters, (GCHQ) where it was renamed the Composite Signals Organisation the wireless station at Scarborough became CSOS Irton Moor.

Despite opposition from his employers, he introduced Mary Fenton, his wife and the first Anglo-Indian actress, to the stage. This led him to start his own company, the Alfred Theatre Company, where he, his wife, and other actors had successful careers. Life Khatau was born into a poor Parsi family in 1857, and brought up in a house opposite the Dukkar Bazar (pig market) in the Dhobi Talao area of Bombay (now Mumbai). He was an avid reader in childhood and could read and recite Shakespeare's plays. He started acting in 1875 and subsequently caught the attention of Jehangir Pestonjee Khambatta, who owned the Empress Victoria Theatrical Company. Khatau joined the Company in 1877 following which Khambatta taught him stagecraft. Khatau was rehearsing for his play Inder Sabha when Mary Fenton, a daughter of an Irish soldier in the British Indian Army, had come to book the hall for her magic lantern show. She admired his acting, met him, fell in love and finally married him. Fenton subsequently adopted the Parsi name of Mehrbai. Khatau then trained her in singing and acting in the 1870s. Fenton created a sensation in the theatre due to her talent and relationship with Khatau. However, a dispute arose between Khatau and Khambatta regarding her entry into theatre. Khatau therefore left Bombay for Delhi and joined the Alfred Theatre Company, owned by Manek Master who also opposed Fenton. As a consequence, in 1881, Khatau left and started his own Alfred Theatre Company with others, following which Fenton had a long and successful career. It was later renamed the New Alfred Company. Fenton and Khatau later separated. They had a son Jahangir Khatau who took over the Company and kept it operational until 1932. Fenton acted in Nanabhai Ranina's Nazan Shirin (1881), Bamanji Kabra's Bholi Gul (Innocent Flower, 1882, based on Ellen Wood's English novel East Lynne), Agha Hasan Amanat's Urdu opera Inder Sabha, Khambatta's Khudadad (The Gift of God, 1898, based on Shakespeare's Pericles, Prince of Tyre), Gamde ni Gori (Village Nymph, 1890), Alauddin (1891), Tara Khurshid (1892), Kaliyug (1895) and Kalidasa's Sanskrit play Shakuntala; many produced by his Alfred Company. The Alfred Company had several popular actors like Sohrabji Oghra, Amrit Keshav Nayak, and Vallabh Keshav Nayak who performed adaptations of Shakespeare's plays. Syed Mehdi Hasan Ahsan's Khun-e-Nahaq (Unjustified Murder, 1898, based on Hamlet) brought Khatau recognition and he came to be known as \\"India's Irving\\" by viewers. At one time he managed and significantly influenced Narayan Prasad Betab, a future prominent Parsi playwright. He was also a musician and his songs for Alibaba became popular. He was honoured for his contribution to Gujarati and Urdu theatre in 1908. He died on 16 August 1916 on a tour in Lahore.

Sloane was born in 1879 in Brooklyn, New York but spent much of his adult life in South Orange, New Jersey. Sloane was already photographing by the summer of 1894, when he photographically documented a week-long cruise with his father on a sloop yacht on Long Island Sound. Pictures of this trip survive in an album he compiled that is now at the Mystic Seaport Museum, Mystic, Connecticut. Sloane was most active as a naturalistic photographer at the turn of the twentieth century, garnering acclaim for his gum bichromate work. In Sloane's early twenties, he focused primarily on portraiture, becoming a professional sometime thereafter and remaining active until the 1940s, when a diving accident severely impaired his eyesight. Sloane experimented with gum bichromate, platinum, pigment, gaslight and gelatin silver prints and various lenses. Sloane was perhaps an unlikely photographer, having graduated from Columbia University in New York City with a degree in electrical engineering like his father, Dr. T. O'Conor Sloane, a noted scientist, prodigious author of scientific books and articles, and the editor of Amazing Stories. Sloane's brother, John Eyre Sloane, also a Columbia graduate, married Thomas Edison's daughter Madeleine. Sloane had worked as a research assistant at Columbia and independently as an electrical engineer before pursuing his passion for photography. Sloane began exhibiting with Alfred Stieglitz's [photograph of Sloane, Jr. by Stieglitz, c. early 1900s] cadre of artistic amateur photographers at The Camera Club of New York and in 1902 was an original member of the influential Photo-Secession movement, with his work appearing in that year's National Arts Club exhibition. In addition to exhibitions in New York, Sloane's photographs were exhibited in Chicago and Philadelphia in 1900, London in 1901 and Turin in 1902. Sloane's photographs appeared in Photo Beacon (June 1900), Camera Notes (October 1900), Photographic Times (November 1900 and January 1904), The American Annual of Photography (1901) and Camera Work, No. 3 (July 1903). An article he wrote, \\"Photography as a Craft,\\" appeared in the January, 1920 edition of The Photo-Miniature. By 1931 Sloane had relocated to Westport, Connecticut where in 1935 he was commissioned by the Westport Preservation Alliance (WPA) Federal Arts Project to photograph the historic houses of Westport and environs. His photos were black and white using glass plate negatives. A gum print that he created during this time was shown at the Connecticut Tercentenary exhibition in New Haven. Sloane maintained a long friendship with fellow Photo-Secessionist and West Redding, Connecticut resident, photographer Edward Steichen. Sloane's photographic work can be found in art auctions, public and private collections, exhibitions, and museums across the nation. Examples include: \\"New York City Construction Site\\" (c. 1900) in the collection of the Milwaukee Art Museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; \\"Landscape with Trees\\" (c. 1905) in the collection of the Saint Louis Art Museum in St. Louis, Missouri; \\"Cloud Study\\" (c. 1910) in the collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City (\\"Our Future is in the Air: Photographs from the 1910s\\" exhibition, November 10, 2010 through April 10, 2011); photograph of Thomas Alva Edison (c. 1914) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery of The Smithsonian in Washington, D.C.

He is the chapter president of Formosan Association for Public Affairs(FAPA) Los Angeles Chapter and chipo(branch) head of World United Formosans for Independence or WUFI, an organization promoting Taiwan independence. Wu is the secretary-general of Taiwan Center Foundation of Greater Los Angeles, who also serves as the foundation's board member and is the chairman of Taiwanese American Heritage Week Committee of Greater Los Angeles for the years 2017 and 2018. Wu also serves as an executive committee member of the Democratic Progressive Party US West Chapter and due to his many involvements in the overseas Taiwanese community, he also serves as an Overseas Community Affairs Council advisor for the Los Angeles area.

Career  Wu decided to pursue a professional career in banking and investments for a major American bank after college before he became more involved in Taiwanese American community works. Wu believes the naturally independent\\"(Â§©ÁÑ∂Áç®) generation are more supportive of Taiwan independence and are more willing to sacrifice for their nation for they just want to have a Taiwanese nation for the people of Taiwan. Wu sees the greatest challenge of Taiwan independence movement is its lack of consensus among different generations of Taiwan independence advocates. On US-Taiwan relations, Wu suggests Taiwan is not a pawn but a lead role. As FAPA Los Angeles chapter president, Wu organized genocide prevention events that aimed to commemorate February 28 Incident and further mutual understandings of various ethnic groups victimized by government oppression. Wu in the 2017 event stood with featured keynote speaker Rebiya Kadeer and openly support the independence movement for Taiwan and East Turkestan, and against Chinese government.

Walter Swan; 1834 ‚Äì 31 July 1884) was an Irish- born Australian journalist and short-story writer.  Biography  He was born in Monaghan, Ireland, and was said to be educated at the University of Glasgow. In the 1850s he travelled to Victoria in Australia, to take part in the gold rush in the colony; he had some success with a claim in Sandhurst. On his way to Melbourne after abandoning gold-digging, he met the writer Henry Kingsley, spending a few days with him shortly before Kingsley's return to England. He was also friends with Marcus Clarke and Henry Kendall. Settling in Ararat, Swan became editor of the local paper, the Ararat Advertiser. In 1869 he moved to Stawell where he edited the Pleasant Creek News. He sometimes attended the Yorick Club in Melbourne. He wrote stories, some of which appeared in serial form in publications including the Sydney Mail and the Melbourne Australasian.Ken Gelder, Rachel Weaver. Colonial Australian Fiction: Character Types, Social Formations and the Colonial Economy. Sydney University Press, 2017. Page 97. Het wrote three books, one of which Luke Miver's Harvest was first published in 1879 in the Sydney Mail as the winning entry in a literary competition which won Swan a prize of ¬£100, in addition two collections of his stories were published: Tales of Australian Life (London, 1875) and A Couple of Cups Ago, and other stories (Melbourne, 1885). Swan's father was described as a linen merchant and his early education in Monaghan was under the tutorship of the Presbyterian minister Reverend John Bleckley who had earlier been teacher to Charles Gavan Duffy. Swan had a son, Walter Blakely Swan, and it is thought that he honoured his teacher in his son's middle name. One of his obituarist's claimed that he had studied at the University of Glasgow but that University has no records of a student called N.W. Swan between 1850 and 1854, he may have attended Belfast's Royal Academical Institution but its records for the period have been lost. His wife was Mary Ellen O'Brien who was born in 1845 in County Tipperary, they married in Ararat's Roman Catholic Church.

He emigrated to Berlin in 1924 and then to Paris in 1933 where he worked for the Parfums de Mury. After the Second World War, he was hired by Louis Amic at Roure Bertrand Fils and Justin Dupont (later merged in Givaudan). As a perfumer, he created many perfumes like Carven Chasse Gard√©e in 1950. and PM of Mary Quant. He participated in perfume projects for Ungaro and Estee Lauder as well as for Cartier, Dior and Van Cleef & Arpels. On December 12, 1975, he registered the trademark Le Jardin Retrouve and founded the first niche perfume house, a few months before the I'Artisan Parfumeur (1976). Yuri Gutsatz was also a perfume critic and vice president of the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise des Parfumeurs, and one of the founders of Osmoth√®que- the perfume conservatory-, in 1990 with Jean Kerleo.  Biography  Fleeing the Russian Revolution of 1917, Yuri Gutsatz left Saint Petersburg for Berlin in 1924 before emigrating to Paris in 1933, where he joined Parfums de Mury. This company had bought the perfumes created by Paul Poiret. They asked Yuri Gutsatz to modernize 40 of the brand's fragrances, but when World War II begun, Yuri joined the Foreign Legion and the project never saw the light of the day. Three years later, Yuri Gutsatz was working in the free zone for the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Parfumerie in Marseille. He was then offered training in perfumery by Chiris, in Grasse, under the direction of √âdouard Hache. In 1945, he returned to Paris where he became Chief Perfumer at Roure Bertrand Fils et Justin Dupont, working with Louis Amic, the inventor of modern perfumery and owner of the company. Seven years later, in 1952, Maurice Lehmann, then director of the Paris Opera, gave him the task of perfuming the theater during Act 3 of Rameau's Indes Galantes (Ballet des Roses). The opera had a 3-year run in Paris. In 1956, Yuri Gutsatz was sent by his employer to Bombay to set up a production factory for perfume ingredients in association with the Tata Group, for its perfumery wing, Industrial Perfumes. He lived in Bombay for six years after which he returned to France. At that period, he created the perfumes for its then subsidiary, the Lakm√© brand, which was headed by Simone Tata. Upon his return, he perceived the major changes that had taken place in the perfumery industry of the 1960s: the perfumer and his creativity were muzzled by the all-powerful marketing apparatus. The perfumer as an identity was no longer recognised, in contrast to the traditions of perfumery creation that existed between the 1920s and 1950s, that saw the development of the role of perfumers such as Ernest Beaux and Germaine Cellier. Yuri published several articles on this subject in the Bulletin of the Soci√©t√© Technique des Parfumeurs de France (which subsequently became La Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise des Parfumeurs), among them is \\"Perfumer, your name is nobody\\" and in various other journals. Yuri Gutsatz decided to quit Roure, and registered his own brand, Le Jardin Retrouv√©, on 12 December 1975. The very first Niche Perfumery House was born. He conceived it as an articulation of his concepts on perfumery, creating perfumes of quality at affordable prices, using only the best raw materials available. Among the precursors of niche perfumery was also Jean Laporte, who founded the brand L'Artisan Parfumeur in 1976. Yuri Gutsatz was named the editor of the Bulletin of La Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise des Parfumeurs in 1976. He was also a perfume critic - the very first in the profession. In the inaugural issue, he wrote an article entitled \\"Maison r√™v√©e de la parfumerie\\" (a dream house of perfumery), making him one of the originators of the Osmoth√®que. Yuri Gutsatz held the position of vice president of La Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise des Parfumeurs from 1978 to 1986. In 1990, he participated in the classification of perfumes and the founding of the Osmoth√®que. He died in Paris on 7 April 2005.

Design On the amalgamation of the Dublin and South Eastern Railway (DSER) into the GSR in 1925 the former was found to be short of operational working motive power due to Irish Civil War, maintenance backlog and proportion of stock being life expired. In the interim locomotives from outside the DSER area were used to cover the shortfall. The commuter services to the south of Dublin were best served by a tank engine. The GSR chose not to continue with any DSER designs but created the GSR Class 850 design incorporating several modern features with a single example being built. The acute motive shortage was resolved by this 1933 design by A.W. Harty. It incorporated the modern type Z boiler used successfully elsewhere but many other features were considered conservative and retrospective compared to the class 850 and in practice they were more difficult to access for repairs and maintenance. Harty also produced the GSR Class 710 which was a related design but with a tender. Service The locomotives almost served exclusively on the Dublin‚ÄîBray‚ÄîGreystones passenger commuter services, though they were also scheduled to work the Wexford Mail from Bray to Westland Row and once at least one of the class was noted in Wexford. They were noted for having some difficulty with timekeeping. A 1948 report noted their shortcomings but also noted they were essential for the suburban services they worked. Incidents In 1934 two of the locomotives suffered read end collision damage at Bray. On repair their bunker was extended into the cab increasing coal capacity by about half a ton. Livery The carried standard GSR grey livery and painted side numbers from new, acquiring a CI√â lined green passenger livery with repaints from 1948 onwards.

In 1985, he performed the first successful implant of the Jarvik 7 artificial heart for the purpose of gaining time until a suitable heart donor could be found. The 25-year-old recipient received the heart transplant within two weeks of the implant and survived more than five years. Copeland co-founded SynCardia Systems and after being head of the cardiothoracic surgery programme at the University of Arizona Medical Center (UAMC) in Tucson for over thirty years, he moved to the University of California, San Diego in 2010. He was one of the first presidents of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT), a society he helped co-found and who awarded him its Past Pioneer Award in 2013. Early life and education Stanford Campus Aerial Photo Jack Copeland was born in 1942 in Roanoke, Virginia and is the son of a chemical engineer. He entered Stanford University as a biology major in 1960, and subsequently earned a medical degree there nine years later. His interest in transplant surgery stemmed from his medical student days at Stanford, when he took up a job assisting in heart transplants in animals. Early career Copeland completed his internship and residency at the University Hospital of San Diego County, then assisted at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute at Bethesda, Maryland, where he reported on extended heart preservation outside the body, before returning to Stanford. At Stanford, he became chief resident of cardiac surgery and in 1977 reported the first successful repeat-heart transplant in a human. He was inspired predominantly by heart surgeons Norman Shumway and Edward Stinson and he learned the technique of endomyocardial biopsy and interpretation of organ rejection grading from cardiothoracic surgeon Philip Caves and pathologist Margaret Billingham. The University of Arizona hired Copeland in 1977 and two years later he led the first heart transplant in Arizona. In 1982 Copeland stated that heart transplants were \\"no longer consider[ed] ‚Ä¶ an experiment here. It has become a routine and predictable procedure\\". At Arizona, he was one of the first surgeons in the country to try the technique of \\"piggybacking\\" a second heart in a person, while leaving them the original, a procedure first performed by South African heart surgeon Christiaan Barnard. By 1985, at the age 43, when he was head of the Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery Section at the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Tucson, his team had performed over sixty such transplants. In addition, in 1985, he performed Arizona's first combined heart-lung transplant. The first bridge- to-transplant with a total artificial heart 200x200px In 1985, Copeland and Mark Levinson with help from biomedical engineer Richard Smith, performed the first successful implant of the Jarvik 7 total artificial heart, the early version of the SynCardia TAH, in 25-year-old grocery store clerk Michael Drummond who was suffering with severe heart failure due to cardiomyopathy and was awaiting a heart transplant. It was the first time this procedure was performed successfully as a temporary measure to buy time until a matching donor heart could be found. The previous TAH implants were temporary by Cooley (1969 and 1981) and Copeland (1985) had failed to result in survival for more than days and several were \\"permanent\\" TAH implants by William DeVries (Barney Clark in December 1982) that resulted in short term survival. Prior to the first success, in March 1985, Copeland and his team had emergently implanted the unapproved Phoenix total artificial heart in a critically ill young man. The FDA policy of making exceptions for unapproved devices use in true emergencies followed this case. The Michael Drummond case followed in August 1985. Worsening of Drummond's condition created a desperation for action and the decision to use a TAH. It allowed time to find a matching donor heart. He survived more than five years, having received his heart transplant within two weeks of the implant. His cause of death was lymphoma. Copeland, along with Don B. Olsen, was instrumental in forming CardioWest Technologies and continuing the research and development of TAH technology and its role in bridging-to-heart transplant. Following FDA approval to trial the CardioWest TAH, he published his ten-year trial (1993‚Äì2002), assessing the performance of the TAH in just less than 100 people with class IV biventricular heart failure and at risk of imminent death. All included in the trial were eligible for transplant but were waiting for donors. The trial demonstrated better clinical outcomes when the TAH was used to bridge-to-transplant. In 2001, he co-founded SynCardia Systems which acquired CardioWest Technologies. In 2004, the SynCardia heart was granted FDA approval for use as a bridge-to-transplant. It is the only TAH to obtain FDA approval and be commercially available. Other cardiac surgery In 2000, he performed America's first implant of a paediatric ventricular assist device. In 2010, he and his team also reported their results of using LVADs in infants and children with severe heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy. Other procedures he has led include heart valve surgery, cardiac bypass surgery in adults and the repair of congenital heart defects in infants. Later career Sulpizio Cardiovascular Center He resigned from the University of Arizona in 2010 after heading its Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery Section for over thirty years and subsequently moved to San Diego, where his wife was completing her general surgery training. Here, he joined the faculty at the new Sulpizio Family Cardiovascular Center at the University of California, San Diego. First FDA approved total artificial heart 243x243px On 7 January 2011, during a four- hour operation, Copeland was part of the team that implanted, as a bridge-to- transplant, the world's only FDA-approved total artificial heart (TAH) for temporary use. Heterotopic heart transplant at California On 13 February 2011, Copeland and his team at the UC San Diego Center for Transplantation, performed the rare \\"piggyback\\" heart operation again, resulting in a man having two beating hearts in his chest. Termed a heterotopic heart transplantation, recipient Smith received a donor heart while still keeping his own diseased heart. The alternative option, which would have required two operations, was to offer a Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as a bridge- to-transplantation. The procedure involved placing the new donor heart on the right side of Smith's own heart and then surgically joining the left atria of both hearts to each other to allow oxygenated blood to flow direct from Smith's heart to the donor heart. The new heart's better functioning left ventricle then pumped blood into the aorta. The patient's own right heart continued to pump blood through the lungs. Awards and honours Copeland was one of the co-founders of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) in 1981. In addition, he served as one of the society's first presidents. In acknowledgment of his achievements with artificial hearts and heart-assist devices, he received the 2001 Barney Clark Award. In 2013, he received the ISHLT Past Pioneer Award.

It is also known as Tarcutta Station. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  In the beginning the Wiradjuri (Waradgery) people traversed the Tarcutta Valley, as they moved about their territory which 'extended from about Jugiong and Tumut in the east to the junction of the Lachlan and Murrumbidgee rivers in the west, while their northern boundary was somewhere out between these two rivers and their southern about Billabong Creek.' The Bugong (Bogong moth) formed the Waradgery tribe's principal food during the summer. Their weapons were like those of the natives of the colony, except the spears, which were made of strong knotted reeds approximately long, to which was affixed a piece of hardwood, approximately in length with a rounded point, barbed in some instances with numerous small pieces of flint or agate. Many Aboriginal implements have been found in Keajura district paddocks. The name Tarcutta (Lower) is Wiradjuri for 'meal made from Gulla or grass seed, or flour and cakes made from grass seed. The name Murrumbidgee (Morumbeeja) is Wiradjuri for a flood (or a big one water). The first white colonisers to view these people were Hume & Hovell, who recorded the event on 6 January 1825. Early that year their party of eight persons were crossing the valleys south of Tarcutta. Near Tarcutta the party came upon a group of friendly Aboriginal people. The explorers were very impressed with the physical characteristics of these people and became friendly with them, some of whom later travelled with them as far as Yass. Hume reported that the timber principally observed in the district was stringybark (Eucalyptus sp.). Late in 1829 Charles Sturt explored the Murrumbidgee River, commenting on the last permanent settlement near Jugiong and the last sight of settlers at South Gundagai. The real stimuli to pastoral development were the buoyant conditions of the 1820s and the desire for new and better grazing lands. After 1822 enterprising pastoralists sent members of their families with shepherds or stockmen, or even just sent the shepherds or stockmen, to graze stock in distant areas under Tickets of Occupation. These were sometimes established pastoralists from near Sydney, or Sydney businessmen, or even both. Although much of this early pastoral development of the region was a part of wider family and company interests, some early settlers had no pastoral interests outside the area. A good example was Thomas Mate, an Englishman who settled on the Tarcutta Creek thirty miles east of Wagga Wagga in 1835 or 1836, and quickly expanded his activities to include a store and inn because of his position on the Port Phillip Road. When licences were introduced in 1837 the Murrumbidgee River frontage had already been occupied below Wagga Wagga. By the same year Thomas Mate had occupied the Upper Tarcutta Creek, John Smith the Kyeamba Creek and there had been settlement on the Hillas and Adelong Creeks. In October 1836 Major Thomas Mitchell's party approached Tarcutta. Near Kyeamba he wrote of finding cattle marks in the valley and tracks of well shod horses, finding a wild herd of at least 800 head. He commented on the dark umbrageous trees overshadowing the noble river, the rich open flats with tame cattle browsing on them, unlike the (other) wild herd. In 1836-7, the first house was only a wattle and daub hut, without floorboards; and in 1838 Thomas Hodgers Mate was the applicant for the runs of Umuther and Toonga, an estimated area of with a grazing capacity of 800 cattle and 11,000 sheep. Lady Jane Franklin, wife of the Tasmanian Governor, and the first woman known to travel overland between Melbourne and Sydney, recorded in her diary: :'Thurs 25th April 1839 Tarcutta Creek', saw Aborigines near Mate's homestead. \\"Dabtoe was the Chief of Hoonbiarjo\\". In 1843 Henry Bingham, a Crown Lands Commissioner in the County of Murray, noted T. H. Mate's run, Umutter, had 27 residents and good huts on the (7770ha) property. \\"An excellent inn kept here and the establishment well conducted\\". Between 1847 and 18499 a new house was built on the opposite side of the creek, with a vertical slab, and U-shaped homestead. G. W. Rusden's estimate of the number of children attending Wagga Wagga School 1849 included 16 from Mate's Tarcutta Run. Thomas Hodges Mate arrived in Sydney in 1833 on the ship \\"Palambam\\" from Sudan via Hobart. He was a cabinet maker. Also on the ship were the Bardwell family, one of whom, 17 year old Maria, was later to become his wife. They married on 8 February 1836 at St. James' Church, Sydney and would go on to have eight children. Mate was born in Kent on 5 April 1810 (according to Heaton) into a French Huguenot family with the name \\"Meitte\\" (pronounced 'Mate'). He spent part of his childhood in France and was always interested in the French language. He remained in Sydney for 12‚Äì18 months, having A¬£1000 in funds. Taking the advice of friends he moved into the interior in 1835. At the age of 23 his first speculation was to buy some sheep from Hannibal Macarthur, a nephew of John Macarthur of Camden Park and Elizabeth Farm, Parramatta. He headed south with his flock by bullock wagon and horseback with his wife and infant in the late spring of 1836 and finally settled down on the Tarcutta Creek. Reports of the Aborigines' depredations on the Murray were such as to deter Mate from going further south. His relations with the blacks who numbered as many as 300 or 400 camping around his place at the one time were such that they never killed nor even molested a single person on the station, nor did any appreciable damage during a period of forty years, and were otherwise useful about the station. Mate succeeded with the Aborigines in the district by kindness and firmness. He insisted on them obeying his orders, and faithfully kept his promises to them. Mrs Annie Thompson (daughter of T.H. Mate) on her 100th birthday said that \\"the Aborigines at Tarcutta were always friendly but her father never employed them regularly on the station. He certainly would not let them in or near the homestead.\\" 'Some of the blacks assisted on the station at shearing time, and they were even given the carcasses of sheep which sometimes were drowned when they were being put through the trough after shearing'. 'I fear that sometimes a sheep was held under too long...but the blacks were not above eating drowned mutton.' By 1835 Gundagai was the terminal point of settlement...from this point the great age of pastoral occupation...squatting...set in. A further effort was made in 1836, by Act of Council, to control the squatting boom, part by the imposition of annual licenses of A¬£10 each. Thus Mate became the largest landholder in the district. When the first map of the Port Phillip (later Melbourne) Road was printed in June 1836 two buildings were shown where Tarcutta is now located. Other settlers were located along the mid-reaches of Tarcutta Creek. The blacks were very active and numerous just then, and the reports of their depredations on the Murray were such as to deter Mr Mate from going further than Tarcutta. With the introduction of \\"Depasturing Licenses' in 1837, Mate's name appeared in the NSW Government Gazette as a landholder in the Murrumbidgee-Southern and Yass districts. Hambledon homestead is one of the earliest buildings in this part of the state. The first house was only a wattle and daub hut, without floorboards, but by 15th June 1839 Mate had an Inn, a Store and an established sheep station by the creek. He became a licensed publican on 1 July 1839 for his \\"Tarcutta Inn\\". His Store Book for 1839, found in the ceiling at Hambledon, gives a list of the large stock of goods available from the general store in 1839. The store became an important coaching station in an extensive network of mail services from the Upper Murray and Balranald. Its importance declined after the construction of the railway to Wagga Wagga in 1878. The settlement of Tarcutta grew up around Mate's homestead. Later, believed to be over the years 1847-9, a new house was built on the opposite side of the creek. This vertical slab, U-shaped homestead is still in use (1973) under the current name \\"Hambledon\\". It was probably in this building that Tarcutta's first Post Office was opened in 1849. In 1848 landholders had to declare their holdings and define the boundaries thereof. Mate's Tarcutta land was described as named \\"Umuther and Toonga\\" (Umutbee), of , with 800 cattle and 11,000 sheep, stretching from near Oberne to Lower Tarcutta, then south-west to near Keyamba, then east to Osborne. The length of boundary was . Other properties were described at Kulki, Tumberumba, Walla Walla and Oberne. In 1850 the drought was broken with a flood. Also in 1850 Mate became a general storekeeper in Albury, when the Beechworth gold diggings opened. He became influential in Albury, later becoming Mayor. By 1894 this store, \\"Mates Ltd.\\" had grown to become one of the largest provincial businesses in the colony, employing 50 hands in the 1870s and second to few such houses outside Sydney. He always continued to personally supervise and manage this business, while his sons attended to his station properties. These included Umutbee, Toonga, Kulki and Tumberumba. Hambledon was managed in 1855 by Mate's son Alfred. An 1858 survey of Mate's Umutbee shows a U-shaped building with a separate building at the rear and a line of smaller buildings on one side. In general, this approximates to the present large U-shaped slab homestead and brick kitchen block. Mate's interest in the Robertson Land Act led him to seek election to Parliament as the Member for Hume. He was returned to oppose the Robertson Land policy, being in favour of confining free settlement to the 19 old counties. He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 15 December 1860 until 15 November 1869. While in the House, Mate succeeded in inscribing on the statute book the useful Act dealing with the \\"Careless use of Fire\\". He also assisted in passing the Public Schools Act of 1866 and supported the Martin-Parkes administration. Also during his term he was gazetted a Magistrate of the Territory. Early in 1872 a special correspondent of the Town & Country Journal visited Tarcutta describing: Another reporter in February 1879 wrote: \\"Tarcutta is very quiet, and being now off the main coach road to Albury and Melbourne, little happens worth recording.\\" This was soon after the opening of the Wagga Wagga railway station. After his wife Maria died in 1877 he left Tarcutta to live in Albury. In 1882 he remarried. Florence Ada Mate (n√©e Brown) had come to the Ovens diggings with her father. In 1884 a daughter was born. From 1886-9 Mate was an Alderman of Albury Council and in 1888 he became Mayor. At Brae Springs, Walla Walla, he built a fine residence where he retired and he died at Manly on 22 July 1894. Mate's children appear to be as follows: Sopia (1836); Thomas (?), Annie (1840); William (1842); Frederick (1844); Emily Ann (1849), Alfred (1851); Maria (?) and Florence (1884). The whole of the Tarcutta, Oberne and Humula areas were completely burnt out in January 1905, due to fence-high red and kangaroo grass through the dead timber. 1914 was among the driest season recorded, other dry years were 1896, 1902, 1929, 1940 and 1944. In 1938-9 Tarcutta Creek dried up at the bridge and even the Murrumbidgee ceased to flow. 1916, 1917, 1923, 1932, 1934, 1950, 1952, 1956 and 1959 all recorded floods. 1940 and 1952 recorded fires in or around Tarcutta areas. Amongst later owners of Hambledon were Henry Tyson \\"The King\\" and Charles Owen Lloyd-Jones. The present owner is best known as an Olympic equestrian. The restoration of this building was assisted by a $50,000 loan made available from the Heritage Conservation Fund in 1982. As one of the conditions attached to the assistance, the owner applied to the Minister for the making of a Permanent Conservation Order over the item.Heritage Branch Manager's report 233/84, 26 July 1984  Description  The building is constructed of vertical slabs and is U-shaped; the northern wing dates from the 1837 period. An 1858 survey of Mate's Umutbee shows a U-shaped building with a separate building at the rear and a line of smaller buildings on one side. In general, this approximates to the present large U-shaped slab homestead and brick kitchen block. Hambledon's slab construction is of great interest, especially as the building is larger than slab buildings generally. The building is of considerable technical interest for its slab construction. It is an important example of vernacular timber building and is larger than many other slab structures.Criteria B.2 and F.1 Hambledon is the largest- surviving slab homestead in Southern NSW. The building is of vertical slabs and U-shaped; the northern wing dates from the 1837 period. The vertical adzed timber slabs fit into a channel in the bottom sleeper and are held in place at the top plate by a batten. Single storey, the house has a hip roof which is clad with corrugated iron (the earlier shingles remain under the iron). A verandah, which has a separate iron roof to the main roof, runs across the front wall and down one side. The slabs are painted white. Interior walls are timber stud covered on both sides with lathe and mud plaster. The front door is six panelled and has a brass knocker. At the rear a detached brick kitchen faces the internal courtyard. Chimneys have some slight corbelling.  Condition  As at 26 May 2008, the complex comprises: * a brick outbuilding - * a kitchen: sandstock brick walls show evidence of salt-damp and some drainage problems (1981); * a weatherboard shed west of kitchen: reasonable condition; needs new gutters (1981) * homestead (slab): good - the building has been slightly changed over the years with more modern facilities such as kitchens and bathrooms required within the main house, only slight modifications and reinstatement of contemporary detail is required to restore Hambledon fully (1981,1982).

Biography  Born in Saint-Brieuc, Merlet studied music at the Conservatoire de Paris, where his teacher was Tony Aubin. There he won prizes for harpsichord, chamber music, counterpoint, fugue, musical composition and musical analysis (in Olivier Messiaen's class). From 1978, he taught fugue there, succeeding Yvonne Desportes at this post. He won the Grand Prix de Rome in 1966. In 1979, he was in charge of teaching music writing at the International Japanese Summer Academy, and from 1985, he taught writing, orchestration, analysis and composition in China at the Shanghai Conservatory and the Beijing Conservatory. He has been professor of composition at the √âcole Normale de Musique de Paris and at the Schola Cantorum de Paris. In 1995, invited to Greece, he taught composition and orchestration at the Athens Conservatoire.

The river is 51 km long and drains the western sections of the Rila mountain range.  Geography  Under the name Manastirska River, it takes its source from the north-eastern corner of the Upper Fish Lake in the western part of Central Rila at an altitude of 2,225 m in a cirque surrounded by the peaks Yosifitsa (2,697 m) in the east, Kanarata (2,666 m) in the south and Kyoravitsa (2,612 m) in the west. It flows through the Lower Fish Lake, turns in north-western direction and after forming a large convex to the north it turns to the south-west. Following the confluence with its largest tributary, the Iliyna River, it flows in western direction under the name Rilska River. It forms deep and densely forested valley until it reaches the town of Rila and enters the plain and wide Dupnitsa Valley. There, the Rilska River turns in south-western direction and after 10 km flows into the Struma at an altitude of 346 m in the outskirts of the town of Kocherinovo. Its drainage basin covers a territory of 392 km¬≤ or 2.27% of Struma's total. It borders the basins of the rivers Dzherman (a left tributary of the Struma) to the north and north-west, Iskar to the east and north-east, Mesta to the south-east and Blagoevgradska Bistritsa (a left tributary of the Struma) to the south. The Rilska River has predominantly snow-rain feed with high water in late spring and early summer (May‚ÄìJune) and low water in winter (February). Its left tributaries have more contribution to the annual flow because they are situated in southern end of the valley on slopes that face in northern direction and accumulate more snow. The average annual flow is 6.26 m3/s at the village of Pastra and 3.35 m3/s at the confluence with the Struma. The overall annual flow is 241.9 million m3, or 11.4% of Struma's total. The river has low levels of mineralisation and is strongly saturated with oxygen.  Economy  The upper course of the Rilska River There are five settlements along the river: Pastra and Rila in Rila Municipality and Stob, Porominovo and Barakovo in Kocherinovo Municipality. The waters of the upper and middle course are used for electricity by the smalls hydro power stations of Pastra and Rila; the waters are also used for irrigation in the Dupnitsa Valley. The entire length of 38 km of the third class road III-107 between Kocherinovo and the Rila Monastery follows the Rilska River valley. The whole upper course and watershed of the river falls within borders of the Rila Monastery Nature Park. On the river's left banks some 4.8 km downstream of the confluence with the Iliyna is located the Rila Monastery, one of Bulgaria's oldest and most important sanctuaries. The monastery is an important national and international tourist destination and was designated an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Further downstream at the village of Stob, just south of Rilska River's left banks are situated the Stob Earth Pyramids, rock formations, known as hoodoos.

When that vehicle was no longer being made, the designation was then used for this vehicle.  Design  The half track chassis has a similar original design to the Sd.Kfz. 251, so is sometimes mistaken for it. It is fundamentally an Anti Aircraft half track, with the front half armoured, and the back part a flat bed, upon which is mounted a 2 cm flak gun. By March 1945 a total of 644 vehicles had been manufactured. It was crewed by 5, and powered by a Maybach HL42 TUKRM engine, reaching top road speeds of 53 km/h and a range of 250 km on road.

He is the recipient of the Navy Cross, the United States military's second-highest decoration awarded for valor in combat. He completed his career as director of Marine Corps Landing Force Development Center Quantico in 1968. Hurst was also a member of so-called \\"Chowder Society\\", special Marine Corps board, which was tasked to conduct research and prepare material relative to postwar legislation concerning the role of the Marine Corps in national defense. Early career Hurst was born on December 18, 1916, in Fort Valley, Georgia, and attended high school there. He then enrolled in Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, and studied journalism. While studying, he joined the Marine Corps Reserve via a platoon leaders' class in April 1936 and attended several summer training camps. On graduating in June 1938 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, he was designated an honor graduate of the platoon leaders' class and commissioned second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on June 27, 1938. Hurst was subsequently called up for active duty and attached to the Basic School at Philadelphia Navy Yard for further officer training. While at the Basic School, many of his classmates became general officers or had very distinguished career later: Gregory Boyington, Hugh M. Elwood, Lowell E. English, Carl J. Fleps, Charles J. Quilter, Donn J. Robertson or Alvin S. Sanders. He completed training in May 1939 and was attached to the Marine detachment aboard the battleship USS New Mexico. He was stationed in Hawaii, before he received transfer orders for duty with the rifle range at Marine Barracks on Parris Island, South Carolina. He was promoted to first lieutenant in August 1941 and appointed commanding officer of the Marine detachment within Marine Barracks st the Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida. World War II Soon after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hurst was promoted to the rank of captain in February 1942 but remained at Pensacola until his promotion to major in March 1943. He was subsequently ordered to the Naval Reserve Midshipman School in Northampton, Massachusetts, and appointed commander of the Marine Training Detachment within Women's Reserve. In July 1943, Hurst was transferred to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and appointed commanding officer of the Officers' Training School, Marine Corps Women's Reserve Schools. He later completed the Command and General staff course at Marine Corps Schools, Quantico and finally received orders for deployment overseas in April 1944. Hurst sailed to the Pacific area during the same month and assumed command of 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division. Third Battalion was stationed on Pavuvu, Russell Islands for rest and refit after heavy fighting at Cape Gloucester, New Britain in early 1944. The Pavuvu Island was infested with rats and land crabs, what had influence on morale of troops, and moreover many of his men suffered with malaria, but Hurst transformed the battalion back to the combat force again. The First Marine Division (including 7th Marines) was tasked with the capturing of Peleliu, Palau Islands and securing a large Japanese aerodrome, which could be used for further offensive in Pacific. On September 15, Hurst was forced to land his assault battalion of amphibious tanks in single file because of the heavily barricaded beach. Major Hurst braved intense hostile fire and, skillfully organizing his forces, pushed inland through dense undergrowth. Personally reconnoitering the front lines while in full view of enemy machine gun and small arms fire, he directed the battalion in a furious attack on Japanese fortified caves and blockhouses. He was subsequently decorated with the Silver Star for bravery and Navy Presidential Unit Citation. Lieutenant Colonel Hurst then sailed with 7th Marines back to Pavuvu for rest and reequipment and remained there until the January 1945, when they were ordered along with the rest of 1st Marine Division to Guadalcanal for amphibious exercise. The Seventh Marines were ready for combat soon after and sailed for Okinawa at the beginning of April 1945. Hurst and his battalion landed on April 3 and had the honor of being the first Marine unit to make it to the opposite side of the island. He led his battalion during the assault on Wana Ridge and distinguished himself while assisting in the evacuation of a wounded man over a path swept by Japanese small arms fire. Hurst was subsequently decorated with the Navy Cross, the United States military's second-highest decoration awarded for valor in combat. His official Navy Cross citation reads: He then led his battalion during the attack on enemy's emplacements near Kokuba River and advanced to Oroku Peninsula. During the assault on Kunishi Ridge on June 19, Hurst was wounded in the neck by concealed Japanese rifleman and evacuated to the rear. He was relieved by Lieutenant Colonel Stephen V. Sabol and decorated with the Bronze Star Medal with Combat \\"V\\" for his service during the latter part of Okinawa campaign. Hurst also received the Purple Heart for his wounds and second Navy Presidential Unit Citation. Postwar service Hurst was ordered to the United States and spent some time with recovery in the naval hospital. He was subsequently ordered to Washington, D.C., and attached to the Division of Plans and Policies at Headquarters Marine Corps. Hurst served under Brigadier General Gerald C. Thomas in this capacity and later served as Marine Corps liaison officer with the Secretary's Committee of Research on Reorganization in the Office of the Secretary of the Navy under James Forrestal. While in this capacity, Hurts was a member of the so-called \\"Chowder Society\\", a special Marine Corps board under general Thomas, which was tasked by Commandant Alexander Vandegrift to conduct research and prepare material relative to postwar legislation concerning the role of the Marine Corps in national defense. Due to cuts in Marine Corps budget, the threat of merging of the Marine Corps into the United States Army, was more realistic. Also thanks to his work, he is one of the few men who helped the future of the Corps. During his assignment with that board, Hurst had the opportunity to cooperate with great names of modern Marine history such as: Merrill B. Twining, Victor H. Krulak, Merritt A. Edson, Robert E. Hogaboom, James E. Kerr, James C. Murray, Jonas M. Platt, DeWolf Schatzel, Samuel R. Shaw, Robert D. Heinl, James D. Hittle or Marine Corps Reserve officers John R. Blandford, Arthur B. Hanson, Lyford Hutchins, and William McCahill. He left Washington in June 1947 in order to attend Instructors' Orientation Course at the Marine Corps Schools, Quantico. Following the completion of the course, Hurst served as leadership section chief and officer in charge of the student battalion at the Basic School. His duty at Quantico ended in December 1949, when he was attached to the Swedish Language School at Washington Navy Yard and following the graduation in July 1950, he was ordered to Stockholm, Sweden, for duty as assistant naval attache for air at the American embassy. After two years in Europe, Hurst returned to the United States in November 1952 and joined 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. He served as assistant chief of staff for operations under future Commandant of the Marine Corps, Major General Randolph M. Pate. While in this capacity, he was promoted to the rank of colonel in January 1954. Hurst was ordered back to Headquarters Marine Corps in July 1954 and attached to the Operations Division (G-3) as head of Joint Chief of Staff and Plan Review Section and later also served as head of Plans Brach. His tour of duty there ended in June 1957, when he was ordered to the course at National War College in Washington, D.C. He graduated in June 1958 and sailed for Hawaii one month later for duty at joint staff of the commander in chief Pacific Fleet under Admiral Herbert G. Hopwood. Hurst served as head, Southeast Asia Plans and Policy Section until March 1960. Upon his return to the United States, Hurst assumed command of the schools battalion at Camp Pendleton, California and Commander of Pendleton's subcamp ‚Äì Camp Del Mar. Hurst was ordered to Okinawa, Japan, in March 1962 and assumed command of 3rd Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division. He also held additional duty as commanding officer of Camp Schwab. He was nominated for the promotion to the rank of brigadier general in April 1963 and ordered back to Camp Pendleton for duty as assistant division commander, 1st Marine Division. Hurst's general's promotion was confirmed on July 1, 1963. He then served as deputy to Major General William T. Fairbourn until July 10, 1965, when general Fairbourn was ordered for duty in Washington and then assumed temporary command of 1st Marine Division. Hurst did not deploy with the division to Vietnam and was relieved by Brigadier General William A. Stiles. He assumed duty as director of Marine Corps Landing Force Development Center, Quantico, Virginia, in October 1965 and remained in that capacity until his retirement on January 1, 1968. He was decorated with the Legion of Merit for his service in that capacity. Retirement Upon his retirement from the Marine Corps after 32 years of active service, General Hurst settled in Harlingen, Texas, where he served as superintendent of local Marine Military Academy. Brigadier General Edward H. Hurst died on September 6, 1997, and is buried together with his wife Emma Randolph Elebash at Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia. They had together three daughters.

Book: The Gini Methodology: A Primer on a Statistical Methodology First introduced by Corrado Gini in 1912 as an alternative measure of variability, the GMD and its variants (such as the Gini coefficient or the concentration ratio) have been in widespread use in the studies of the income distribution. In their book, Prof. Edna Schechtman and Prof. Shlomo Yitzhaki present GMD statistical tools that replace variance with the GMD and its variants. These new GMD based tools are most justified whenever the researcher cannot conveniently assume a normal distribution of variables under study and used common statistical tools as analysis of correlation, analysis of variance. This makes the GMD and the tools developed by Prof. Edna Schechtman and Prof. Shlomo Yitzhaki of critical importance in the complex research of statisticians, economists, econometricians, and policymakers.

It was designed and built in 1934 by Jim McGilvray and Harold Fife. It is also known as the Chaff cutting train. The property is owned by City of Wagga Wagga. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 December 2004.  History  The Cook's Galley was a mobile kitchen used to prepare food to feed the chaff cutting team owned and run by the Fife family during the 1930s and 1940s. Jim McGilvray (carpenter) and Harold Fife made it from recycled materials in 1934. It consists of a carriage of four steel wheels with a drawbar for towing. The drawbar was attached to the back of a Roden or McClaren traction engine. On top of the carriage a rectangular cabin was fitted with two single full-length doors and a small window at one end. The kitchen contains a coal stove for cooking, a wooden cupboard for storage (below) and food preparation (above). Elsewhere in the kitchen are a number of wooden packing cases, food bins, cooking and eating utensils, fire tools and pitching forks. History of the Fife family business The origins of this particular branch of the Fife family go back to William Fife (1802-1880) who lived on a moderate farm at Drumcullion, County Fermanagh, Ireland. All five surviving children of his first marriage to wife Bessie (n√©e Nixon 1807-1850) immigrated to New South Wales, Australia between 1859 and 1865. The aftermath of the Great Famine, the death of their mother, their father remarrying and better prospects in an overseas colony were all contributing to factors to them leaving Ireland. The Keenan family, their neighbours in Ireland, had a daughter in Goulburn, New South Wales, who agreed to sponsor the new migrants - Faithy (1836-1903), Nixon (1840-1916), John (1838-1874), George (1848-1916) and Eliza (1846-1939). Their ages on arrival were 23, 19, 24, 14 and 19 respectively. Harold's great grandfather, Nixon started work as a yardman in a hotel, then became a carrier driving a bullock team between Sydney and Cooma. Later he bought and worked land in the vicinity of Goulburn. He married Elizabeth Cole (1849-1879) in 1870 who bore him six children. Harold's grandfather, William (1871-1956), the eldest son of Nixon, was the first of the family to operate a chaff cutting business. He also bred horses, worked as a railway line contractor during lean times, and a farmer in later life. He suffered the unfortunate accident of having his left foot crushed by the Buffalo Pitts Traction engine which drove his chaff cutting plant. He married Mary Jane Whittaker (1874-1904) in 1896 and they had two sons William Clyde (1897-1971) and James Nixon (1898-1972), Harold's father and uncle respectively who played a major role in the family's chaff cutting, produce store and bakery businesses in Wagga Wagga. It was while working on his father's (William's Snr) chaff cutting plant at Sherwin's Flat, Tarago, that Harolds' father met his future wife, and Harold's mother, Myrtle Wyatt. In about 1919 Harold's father, William Clyde, moved to Wagga Wagga to work for Les Howard who operated a chaff cutting plant. (Howard also originated from Goulburn). He was paid one shilling per ton and had an average weekly wage of 2 pounds 8 shillings. James Nixon (1898-1972), William's younger brother and Harold's uncle, joined him. Initially they camped in the Jockey's Room at the pony racecourse where Norton Street is now located and on the site which in years to come would house their Chaff Mill and Bulk Store. Harold and his mother joined his father and uncle in Wagga and with good prospects in the chaff industry persuaded their Uncle Tom, who lived in Goulburn, to purchase Les Howard's chaff cutting plant. For a number of years they worked for Uncle Tom before buying the plant from him and establishing Fife Bros in 1925. Tom Fife still lived in Goulburn so the sale to his nephews suited him. For almost three decades the family business travelled rural New South Wales cutting hay under contract to James Dunn Ltd., Stockman and Kleinig & Co., Kerridge & McMahon Ltd., and E.D. McMahon & Co. Chaff cutting at the time was a huge industry as motor trucks were only starting to become widespread and there were big markets for chaff in Sydney, in the coal fields of New South Wales and Roma Street, Brisbane. In these centres household deliveries were still done by horse-drawn vehicles and as the mines were not fully mechanised pit ponies were still in use. With increasing prosperity the family bought their first of three Cliff and Bunting chaff cutters in 1927 and featured it at the Wagga Wagga Show. Their first vehicle was a Model T Ford which Clyde used in the evenings, after completing his daily stint on the plant, to travel between plants to deliver spare parts, bags, provisions and meat. A Chevrolet Utility was purchased from Minty's Dealership, Wagga Wagga in 1927. Crop failures, labour strikes and the depression brought difficult times and the chaff cutting plant stood in the backyard of the family's No.9 Shaw Street home for many years. During these tough times Harold's father took labouring work on the roads with the Wagga Wagga Municipal Council and as a fettler with the New South Wales Railways. His mother collected the fat from the Galley and made it into soap and also sold it to the soap works in town to earn much needed income. Around 1940 the brothers purchased the Swan Bakery and soon owned and operated four shops drawing on the labour of various family members. Irene Wealand, Harold's aunt, remembers his mother making attractive and warm Wagga rugs from chaff bags for the household beds. The chaff bags were opened and filled with old woollen garments, sandwiched together sewn together and then covered with a heavy patterned material. In 1949 the brothers dissolved their business partnership. Harold and his father held onto the chaff cutting plant and the produce store, which had been established in 1945, at 45 Baylis Street, while his uncle (James) took over the two bakehouses and four retail outlets and formed J. N. Fife and Sons with his boys, Ken and Edgar (Ned). The business was expanded with new partners and later known as the Riverina Baking Co. A large bakehouse was built in Edward Street behind the Wagga Flour Mill. A chaff mill was established at The Rock in 1945. This was a result of criticism levelled at the chaff cutters whose machinery due to their heavy steel wheels damaged the roads. A second mill was established at a site in Norton Street which lasted for about five years as difficulties were still experienced with transporting hay from the farms to the mill the authorities been particularly strict on over wide loading. The focus of the business shifted to the produce store and fertiliser. At the age of thirteen Harold joined his father in the chaff cutting plant. In his father's words, If he won't go to school, he might as well go to work! Harold started as a lunch boy and by his fourteenth birthday had moved to the chaff cutter been taught the ropes by the older men. At the age of eighteen (1937) a second plant was purchased and Harold put in charge. The plant was in Blayney when news of the outbreak of the World War II was made known. Harold enlisted and served for three years. In 1944 he was discharged under the Manpower Act and returned to the cutter. In later years he followed in the footsteps of his father and became a City Councillor and a Deputy Mayor of Wagga Wagga both serving for a period of 21 years. Harold's younger brother Wallace Clyde Fife (1929- ) went into politics and became the Member for Farrer. Harold's uncle, James, was badly burnt, in 1939, when the steam box exploded he was working on. Painted with Gentian Violet he spent many weeks recuperating at home. Regional context and details of chaff cutting industry Chaff, as petrol is today, was a much-needed fuel when the horse was the primary source of power and transport on Riverina farms between the late 19th century and the end of Second World War. Horse numbers reached their peak in 1919 when there were two million horses in Australia - one horse for every two head of population. Over the next three decades the tractor gradually replaced them. To maintain their health and strength working horses needed to be fed three times per day. The most convenient form of fed was to cut hay into chaff and then mix it with other grains such as oats. One horse consumed about of feed per year. As a result, most farmers kept a proportion of their crops for feed which would amount to per annum if they had two 8-horse teams. Others are known to have cut more than a year. Chaff was also stocked piled for periods of drought and used to feed cattle and sheep as well as horses. Additional demands for chaff came from teamsters and townspeople that used horses for transport. As a result of these demands for horse feed chaff cutting became a profitable business with a number of firms, of which the Fife brothers were one, operating in the Riverina. The hay season usually stretched from early November until the end of January the following year. With the use of binders, pulled by three horses, the hay was cut, tied into sheaves, and bundles of about ten sheaves, tied together to form a stook and left to dry. The stooks were then collected and carted to a site for the building of a haystack. Chaff cutting teams cut the hay into chaff either directly from the stooks in the paddock or from the haystacks. The Fife family plant consisted of a Roden or McLaren 8 horse power, two-cylinder traction engine, cook's galley, cliff and bunting chaff cutter, dobbin (or wagon), steam box, and water cart. Linked together in this order they formed a train which moved from one farm to another around the district. On arriving at a farm the plant was set up next to the haystack(s). The farmer had to supply the wood and water for the steam traction engine which had a capacity of 300 gallons. Up to four Furphy carts of water were used per day. The ratio of wood needed per ton of chaff cut was of wood for one tonne of chaff. The wood was cut to lengths for feeding into the furnace. Stackmen, armed with pitching forks, passed the sheaves to a man at the steam box who cut the twine holding them together and feed the loose hay, with the help of a conveying mechanism, through the steam box long and wide. Steaming the hay before it was cut prevented it from breaking and greatly improved its quality. The steam was supplied from the steam engine through a pipe. When the hay reached the Chaff Cutter it was fed through a pair of rollers and cut. The cut hay fell onto a type of sieve, called a riddle board, which fed it onto an elevator taking it to a double chute of bagging cylinders. Long pieces of uncut hay fell onto a caving elevator which took it back through the cutters. There were two bag sewers who in turn filled and sewed alternate bags. The machine would cut 1 or 2 bags of chaff per minute which after being sewn up were loaded straight onto a truck which depending on its size was allowed to carry 152, 184 or 220 bags. The blades of the cutter had to be sharpened or replaced at regular intervals and Harold prides himself at been able to change and set six knives within three minutes. The traction engine supplied the steam box with steam as well as the power for driving the cutter. The pulley belt turning the drive wheels was long and wide and made of a compound of two or three ply leather sewn together with copper rivets. It cost A¬£100 (a pound a foot). It also generated a considerable amount of static electricity which made ones hair stand upright if you stood beneath it. The dobbin was either a three-wheel or four-wheel cart used to carry new bags, tarpaulins, sleeping equipment and spare parts. A horse drawn Furphy Cart was used to bring dam water to the engine for steaming purposes. Drinking water and water used for cooking was stored in a tank and two drums were brought separately to the galley by Clyde Fife. The tank and drums were placed at the back of the galley. Time spent on a farm varied from as short as a day to a week. On average the plant cut a day but they could reach if pushed to the limit. The normal routine was an eleven-hour day, starting at 7:00am, stopping for a short smoke break at 9:00am, dinner between 12 noon and 1:00pm, a ten-minute tea break at 3:00pm and calling it a day around 6:00pm. The business operated for all but two weeks in the year and in good times the Fife family owned and operated two plants. The routine of the cook was as follows: The wood stove was fired at 5:45am for a 6:30am breakfast to facilitate a 7:00am start. Because of the heavy labour involved breakfast consisted of one pound of sausage per man with toast and tea. Dinner consisted of roast meat, potatoes, carrots, parsnips and turnips with a sweet to end. The evening meal was usually cold meats and salads. Scones, jam tarts and biscuits were served during the mid-morning and mid-afternoon breaks. Tea appeared at all meals. When the chaff cutting plant was in full production sixteen men were fed from the galley. When out in the field provisions were usually delivered on a Monday supplemented with fresh bread and meat on a Wednesday due to the absence of refrigeration. Rates of pay for the various labourers were as follows: *Water Joey: 4 pence plus food *Stackmen: 4 pence plus food *Steam Box Feeder: 4 pence plus food *Cutter/Feeder: 5 pence plus food *Bag Sewers: 6 pence plus food *Cook: 2 pounds, 1 shilling per week, plus three pence per ton *Driver: Retainer (not disclosed) *Hammocks for the Cook and Engine Driver were strung beneath the Galley (chains still present) while the rest of the men made makeshift mattresses from bales of hay. Wagga Rugs were the principal source of warmth.  Description  Interior of Mobile Cook's Galley It consists of a carriage of four steel wheels with a drawbar for towing. The drawbar was attached to the back of a Roden or McClaren traction engine. On top of the carriage a rectangular cabin was fitted with two single full-length doors and a small window at one end. The kitchen contains a coal stove for cooking, a wooden cupboard for storage (below) and food preparation (above). Elsewhere in the kitchen are a number of wooden packing cases, food bins, cooking and eating utensils, fire tools and pitching forks. The galley was built in 1935 and operated until 1954.  Condition  As at 22 October 2004, the item was intact and in a good, sound condition. With the exception of a number of new wooden planks on its rear platform, a material foot plate at its entrance, and a small number of nuts and bolts in the doors, it remains in original condition. This adds considerably to its value and importance as its surfaces and features retain their unique working characteristics. The mobile galley is believed to be one of only two retained in NSW and has been retained substantially in its original built and used condition.  Heritage listing  As at 14 June 2006, the Cook's Galley, as an element of the Fife family chaff cutting plant, was a significant item representing a historical phase of grain harvesting in the Riverina. It represents a period between the 1880s and 1940s that saw the dominance of horse-drawn power for rural farm operations and transport generally throughout NSW. Chaff cutting provided fuel for horses which were the principle form of power and transport on farms and the cities during the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. They pulled the drays, wagons or a variety implements for the sowing, harvesting or transporting of wheat, machinery, for mining operations, and delivery of other produce. With the rest of the chaff cutting plant having been broken up, the Cook's Galley remains a tangible example of the Fife chaff cutting business and about the men who worked this and similar machines on a number of farms in rural New South Wales. The family, great-grandchildren and grandchildren of Irish migrants, contributed to the rural economy and political life of the Riverina. The item retains a high level of integrity and significant display and educational roles. Mobile Cook's Galley, Museum of the Riverina was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 December 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Cook's Galley was part of a larger chaff cutting plant owned and operated by the local Wagga Wagga Fife family. It represents a distinct stage in the NSW economy where horses played a seminal role in rural, manufacturing, mining and transport industries. In the days before motorised machinery such as tractors and lorries, securing chaff for horse feed was a critical task in servicing the State's animal labour force. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Fife family chaff cutting \\"trains\\", that included a mobile cook's galley, played an important role in the harvesting of chaff for a thirty-year period. The teams were a common fixture on rural properties throughout the Riverina, Central West and North West of NSW. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Mobile Galley was an element in a travelling \\"train\\" that comprised a steam- powered traction engine that towed the kitchen, a chaff cutting machine, a dobbin (wagon), a steam box and a water cart. Collectively, the \\"train\\" showed a marked level of local ingenuity in the adaptation of existing vehicle types for a specific rural technological need. The mobile galley was hand built from an original stone wagon, with the introduction of a cabin area fitted out specifically to cook and store food in remote farm areas. It had to be self- contained and provide 3+ meals a day for periods extending up to seven days. While subject to harsh conditions, the survival of the vehicle in a near- original form is testimony to the inventiveness and skills of its builders, Jim McGilvray (carpenter) and Harold Fife of Wagga. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Originating from Ireland and settling in Goulburn between 1859 and 1865, the Fife family remain a prominent family in the Riverina district. The Fife Brothers company was formed in Wagga during 1925, although family members had already settled and been working in the chaff industry there. The successful family business operated throughout NSW for some thirty years, surviving the Depression years and World War Two. The family diversified into chaff mill, bakery and produce areas, and several members played prominent roles in local and Federal politics. Life in the chaff cutting industry involved long hard labour, and the provision of meals and refreshments through the mobile 'canteen's' played an important social role in the servicing and support of the local labour market. The galley's integrity and retention by the original family which built and operated the vehicle contributes to its social significance values. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Cook's Galley and original chaff cutting \\"train\\" has been effectively researched and interpreted and it is unlikely that significant new insights will be documented regarding its impact on past farming and agricultural practices. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Cook's Galley is unique in NSW being one of only two known retained examples of a mobile farm kitchen and retains a high level of integrity. Now a fixture of the respected Museum of the Riverina, the Cook's Galley offers a unique opportunity to examine a past, defunct, way of rural life - the harvesting of chaff to provide feed for the working horse population of NSW. The importance of this industry is identified with the State's horse population of 1919 being 2.5 million - one for every two people in the State. With the widespread introduction of mechanized machinery on the farm, particularly following World War Two, the chaff industry was lost to the tide of petroleum and other fuel needs. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The mobile cook's galley is today representative of a once commonplace rural activity in the grain harvesting areas of NSW. The growing, cutting, storage and processing of grains for chaff, supplied necessary horse feed and stock food reserves. The industry therefore played a significant underlying role in the development and support of the State's rural and general economies at a time that depended on horse- drawn power for many sectors of industry.

ANLF was founded in Cairo in December 1962, through the merger of the National Liberation Front and the Free Princes Movement. Talal bin Abdulaziz became the general secretary of ANLF. The formation of a 15-member Political Bureau was announced when the organization was founded. The ANLF had a politically mixed membership, gathering Talal's Egypt-based Free Princes Movement, Nasserists, Ba'athists, the Beirut-based Organization of Saudi Communists and Shia religious leaders. The ANLF was formed as a competitor to the Union of the Peoples of the Arabian Peninsula, a group that sought to confront the Saudi regime militarily via Yemen. The programme of ANLF called for a referendum on the question of the role of the monarchy, constitutional democratic reforms, gender equality, land reform, non-alignment in international affairs and revision of oil agreements. The ANLF had a regular column in the Beirut publication al-Kifah, called 'Voice of the Front'. Declarations in the name of ANLF were broadcast on Egyptian, Syrian and Yemeni radio stations, calling for the overthrow of the Saudi regime. In August 1963 Talal's group broke away from ANLF and begun to seek reconciliation with the royal house, after which the NLF reconstituted itself. The NLF continued to function until August 1974, eventually being replaced by the Communist Party in Saudi Arabia in 1975.

A subsidiary office of ROLACC was created in Geneva, Switzerland, on 28 March 2017. The organisation has been subject to multiple controversies, in particular for its close ties with the Attorney General of Qatar and his family, who own the ROLACC offices in Geneva, and who are accused in the press of ill-gotten property acquired in Europe.  Description  ROLACC organises conferences and training programs and contributes to the financing of research. ROLACC is headed by Ali Bin Fetais al-Marri, Abdulmehsen Hamad Mr. A. Fetais, a member of his family, and Mohamad Khaled Al Koutob. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon attended the inauguration of the centre. In partnership with the University of Sussex, ROLACC also offers a master's degree in Corruption, Law and Governance. In May 2018, the centre signed a partnership with the Foundation for Strategic Research to develop joint programs and exchange knowledge. This agreement between the foundation recognized for its public utility and the Qatari center have been subject to criticism in France, due to a possible conflict of interest.  Controversies   Ill-gotten gains  Although the purpose of ROLACC is \\"to improve the rule of law\\", its founder and president has been accused by Le Point of secretly owning luxurious real estate in Paris and Geneva in inadequacy with his official income In addition, GSG Immobilier SA, a Swiss company owned by the Attorney General of Qatar with his daughter Maha Ali M. A. Fetais, owns the ROLACC offices in Geneva. This scheme surprised various media. The Attorney General of Qatar has also been criticized for having accounts at the National Bank of Kuwait and for having violated several human rights laws.  Reputation laundering  At an awards ceremony against corruption hosted in Geneva by the Attorney General of Qatar, the newspaper Le Temps reported \\"Qatar is awarding itself a prize against corruption,\\" noting that shortly before, the country had funded renovations at the United Nations in Geneva. The newspaper questioned if this award was not \\"a way of countering suspicions\\" of corruption against Qatar.  Corruption accusations  According to French journalists Georges Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot, authors of the book Our Dear Emirs, the Attorney General of Qatar and ROLACC Chairman tried to \\"offer\\" a luxurious watch to Bruno Dalles, the Director of TRACFIN, the French financial intelligence agency, who was scandalized. Bruno Dalles told the reporters: \\"I was both vexed and stuck by the process, while I had just explained him the purpose of my job is to increase transparency in the movement of funds.\\"  Links with Karim Wade  Senegalese media have widely criticized the close ties between Ali Bin Fetais Al-Marri and Karim Wade, Senegalese politician, sentenced for corruption who is now living in exile in Qatar.  Swiss officials boycott  According to the prestigious Swiss newspaper NZZ, Simonetta Sommaruga, the Swiss federal justice minister refused to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with Ali Bin Fetais Al-Marri given his dubious reputation. The Swiss Federal Attorney was passed the file and he initially also refused to sign the document. He eventually did so, discreetly, the newspaper reveals. Qatari officials, including Ali Bin Fetais Al-Marri, have been unhelpful in investigating corruption for the next FIFA World Cup in Qatar, the NZZ reported.

It presently contains in nearly 12,000 burials of German military personnel of World War II, plus some women and children. It is maintained and managed by the German War Graves Commission. History The cemetery, situated at the top of a 30m hill at Mont-de-Huisnes, is the only German crypt construction in France. In 1961, the Reburial Service of the German War Graves Commission interred German soldiers from numerous small graveyards and field graves to the mausoleum; including those previously buried in the French departments of Morbihan, Ille-et-Vilaine, Mayenne, Sarthe, Loir-et-Cher, Indre-et-Loire and Vienne as well as from the Channel Islands of Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney and Sark. The only exception was that the German graves located in the graveyard of Fort-George in Saint Peter Port on the island of Guernsey were not moved. The circular crypt is 47m in diameter and constructed on two floors. Within the inner side of the crypt are 34 crypt rooms on each level containing 180 burials. The floors are connected by gangways and stairs. A large cross dominates the central grassed area. Opposite the entrance, steps lead onto up a natural terrace from which Mont-Saint-Michel can be viewed. The names of the interred are placed on bronze tablets affixed to the walls of each crypt.

With the switch to a new turbocharged flat-four engine the marketing name for the models was changed to Porsche 718, in reference to the 718, which won the Targa Florio race in 1959 and 1960. The name is meant to evoke Porsche's past racing successes with light cars like the 718 that outmaneuvered competitors with larger and more powerful engines. 718 Boxster and 718 Cayman The 718 Boxster was introduced in January 2016, and premiered at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. The 718 Cayman joined the range in April at the Beijing Motor Show. The 718 featured two new horizontally-opposed flat-4 turbocharged engines at 2.0-litre (Boxster/Cayman) and 2.5-litre (Boxster S/Cayman S) displacement with increased torque and horsepower with lower fuel consumption. The S model turbocharger utilizes Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) technology. Later in October 2017, the GTS models were announced with their 2.5-litre engines rated at . The Boxster could accelerate to 97 km/h (60 mph) from a standstill in 4.1 seconds, and the Cayman in 3.9 seconds. Since 2020, the GTS 4.0 model has been offered for both 718 models. The new model features the 4.0-litre flat-6 from the Cayman GT4 and Boxster Spyder, however de-tuned to . Both GTS 4.0 models can accelerate to 97 km/h (60 mph) from a standstill in 4.3 seconds. Styling The exterior of the 718 Boxster and Cayman is very similar to the third generation, more of an evolution than a redesign. The most notable changes are to the rear of the car, which now has a long black-trim bar across the rear connecting the two taillights. The headlights and bumper are also heavily reworked. On the sides, the mirrors have been redesigned, taking hue from the SportDesign mirrors on the GT3. The updated cockpit of the 718 has the 4th generation of the Porsche PCM system, indicated by the display without bezels. This model has multifunction steering wheel controls. The interior remains very similar to the 981 Cayman / Boxster and the 991.2 generation of the Porsche 911. The main change is the new PCM 4.0 infotainment system, which replaces the PCM 3.1. The steering wheel comes with a mode selector switch that includes a selection of Sports and Sports Plus driving modes, resulting in snappier throttle response at the cost of fuel efficiency. Overall, the most prominent design features of the 981 Cayman / Boxster remain, including large air induction ports on the side, and the prominent horizontal aluminium piece used for adding oil and coolant in the trunk. Reception Despite the loss of two cylinders, the 718 Cayman / Boxster was assessed to be mechanically superior to the 981 model with improved acceleration and steering, while the new 4 cylinder engine \\"cheapens the experience\\". The 718 Cayman was declared Motor Trend's 2nd best Drivers car in 2017, which praised the car's handling and throttle response. Giving the award, Miguel Cortina noted, \\"The suspension is just what you want to feel in a car like this‚Äîstiff, sporty, rigid. You get a very good sense of what is happening on the road.\\" By far, the most contentious reaction to the 718 Cayman was the sound of the engine - which received nearly universal criticism by the automotive press. Car and Driver called it a, \\"raspy, uncouth sound that strikes some drivers as unpleasant and grating.\\" Top Gear noted that the sound, \\"fundamentally cheapens the Porsche experience,\\" and makes the car, \\"less upmarket, less cultured and sophisticated than it did before.\\" However, Motor Trend's Ignition tested the 718 Cayman against the 981 Cayman GT4, and found that the performance gains were so strong the car had the capability to outmaneuver the GT4 at a much lower price. They concluded that the tradeoff was probably worth it. The 718 GTS variant of the Cayman and Boxster received generally positive reviews. Visually, the front headlight and rear taillights were smokey black, and an aggressive front sports fascia was added. Performance upgrades included Porsche Sports Exhaust, a Sports Chrono Package, Porsche Stability Management were all added as standard features. By expanding the air intake, the 718 GTS has an additional 15 horsepower and even more torque than the 718 S. In addition, carmine red was added as a color as a $2580 option. Used in most of Porsche advertising with the GTS, the color is darker than Porsche Guards Red, and very similar to the Italian racing color used by Ferrari, Rosso Corsa. Many reviewers, including New York Times contributor Tom Voelk, noted that the 718 GTS had a much more pleasing sound than the base 718 and the 718 S. ‚ÄúOne of the biggest complaints of the 718 is that its turbo 4 engine doesn‚Äôt have the distinctive sound that the outgoing 6 cylinder had,‚Äù said Voelk. ‚ÄúBut the 718 GTS sounds much better. It has different intakes and a larger turbo.‚Äù The sound of the 718 GTS engine has much more prominent bass frequencies, which contrast with a strong treble pitch of the turbocharger. However, Evo magazine argues that, while \\"capable of challenging the 911 as a true sports car\\", the \\"718 version of the GTS doesn't really achieve anything more than the Cayman GTS it replaces\\" and \\"with its more desirable engine, it's the previous model that feels more exotic and like a much higher quality product.\\" It describes the GTS' engine as \\"a nasty sounding motor\\", the noise from the turbo four- cylinder in the cabin as \\"dreadful\\" and \\"tuneless drivel\\" and contests that \\"the only redeeming feature of the 718 GTS sonically is that this is probably the quietest iteration of this motor\\".  718 Cayman GT4 and 718 Spyder  The 718 Cayman GT4 and 718 Spyder (previously named the Boxster Spyder) were revealed in June 2019. Both are differentiated from less powerful models by more aggressive bodywork, including a lower stance, new front bumper, a large new diffuser, and exhaust pipes that are spaced farther apart. The GT4 also features larger side intakes and an adjustable wing, the latter of which helps it generate up to of downforce, 50 percent more than its predecessor. Both have a naturally aspirated 4.0-litre flat-6 derived from the 992's 3.0-litre 9A2EVO engine, which is rated at at 7,600 rpm and of torque at 5,000‚Äì6,800 rpm. The engine has cylinder deactivation, a first for Porsche, and is exclusively paired to a six-speed manual transmission. Porsche claims a top speed of for the GT4, and for the Spyder. The front suspension and brakes are borrowed from the 911 GT3, and the adaptive dampers, ABS and stability-control programming are borrowed from the 911 GT3 RS. The anti-roll bar end links, camber and toe can be manually adjusted, but the ride height‚Äì3 cm (1.2 inches) lower than a standard 718‚Äìis fixed. Both are around 90.7 kg (200 lbs) heavier than the GTS models. Sales commenced in the spring of 2020. For the 2021 model year, the GT4 and Spyder became available with the 7-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission as an option.

In the late 18th century, the annexation of eastern Poland meant millions more Jews were now subjects of the Russian Empire, many of whom flocked to the city. When Catherine the Great created the Pale of Settlement to attempt to contain the new Jewish population, Jewish settlement was largely restricted. Under Tsar Alexander II upper class Jews fitting certain criteria were allowed to live in the city, and many other Jews who did not fit these categories settled illegally. By the end of his reign in 1881, the Jewish population of the city was 17,253. Unlike other cities in the Russian Empire, Saint Petersburg never had a pogrom, likely due to the amount of police and army presence it had as the capital. The community continued to grow, despite expulsions and persecution, and flourished creatively until the Bolshevik Revolution. Under the Soviet Union, Jewish life was stifled and repressed, and a number of Saint Petersburg Jews took part in the refusenik movement and underground revival of Jewish nationalism. Today, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the city remains home to a sizable Jewish community and many Jewish institutions.  19th century and pre-revolution history  Baron Horace G√ºnzburg 1833‚Äì1909, who helped fund and lead the Jewish community after his father. By the 1880s, Saint Petersburg had become a Jewish cultural center, and over the following decades its intellectuals would produce numerous important works. There were Yiddish, Hebrew, and Russian printing presses which were responsible for the printing of daily, weekly, and monthly newspapers that went to the Jewish communities in the Pale of Settlement. In addition to being a center for Jewish literary culture, the city was also headquarters for a number of national Jewish organizations, such as The Society for the Promotion of Culture Among the Jews of Russia, and members of the Saint Petersburg community played a key role in establishing the study of Eastern European Jewry. The city's Jewish communal institutions and aid societies were largely depended on the contributions of a few very wealthy Jewish families, notably Joseph G√ºnzburg and his descendants. Beyond funding much of the Jewish community, the G√ºnzburgs also acted as de facto representatives of the community in dealings with the Central Government. After years of delays and securing permission, the Grand Choral Synagogue in the city was consecrated in 1893, a massive and beautiful building with a seating capacity of 1,200. After its opening, however, the other smaller synagogues in the city were forced to close and the Grand Choral Synagogue became the only place to pray. Saint Petersburg was also a political center for Jews of all stripes, including socialists and those working for the civil rights of the Jewish community. At the end of the 19th century, Genrikh Sliozberg (Slezberg) and other lawyers founded the Saint Petersburg Defense Bureau. The bureau offered free legal services to Jewish victims of discrimination across the empire, and defended Jews against anti-Semitic accusations, such as ritual murder claims. They also attempted to hold the government accountable for pogroms, although unsuccessfully. Other Jewish organizations in the city also worked to try and improve the lives of impoverished Jews in the Pale of Settlement. Unlike the Jewish community in the Pale of Settlement, the community in Saint Petersburg was more Russified. In 1897, about a third of the city's Jews reported their native language to be Russian, as opposed to 3% of the Jews in the Pale. Right before the start of World War I, this number had risen to about 50%. World War I caused mass Jewish migration from battlefield areas in the Pale of Settlement, and the Saint Petersburg community grew to over 50,000, from 35,000 in 1914. A relief agency was set up by local Jews, although the amount of need was overwhelming.  Revolution and World War II  Photo during the Siege of Leningrad After the February Revolution in 1917, all restrictions on Jewish settlement were removed. In June 1917, the Seventh Conference of the Zionist Organization of Russia was held in Saint Petersburg. After the Bolshevik Revolution in October 1917, Jewish political parties were forced underground. Additionally, the next year the capital was moved from Saint Petersburg to Moscow, and the community become far removed from the centers of power. The famine during the Russian Civil War also hit the community, and some returned to provincial towns. More Jews continued to migrate to the city, however, and in 1926 the Jewish population had reached 84,505 (5.2% of the total population). Some of the Jewish cultural organizations tried to continue their work under the new Soviet regime, despite facing growing financial and ideological pressure. By the end of the 1920s, however, all independent Jewish institutions were shut down by the government. Many of the intellectuals who ran them left the country. A decade later, the remaining Communist Jewish organizations were also shuttered, and public Jewish identity was heavily suppressed. By the 1930s, a third of the city's Jews were intermarrying non-Jews. Before the Nazi invasion, the Jewish population of the city was estimated to be 200,000. During the nearly three year long Siege of Leningrad by the Germans, tens of thousands of Jews were among the over one million people who died of starvation or disease.  Post-war Soviet Union  Sylva Zalmanson, a refusenik involved in the hijacking attempt at Leningrad's airport. The Jewish population of the city, no longer being bolster by migration, began on a steady decline, largely due to a combination of low birthrates and assimilation. The 1959 census showed the Jewish population to be 162,344, but some estimate that it was more like 200,000. The Grand Choral Synagogue, still standing despite being bombed by the Nazis, remained the city's only synagogue after the war. In 1962‚Äì1964, the matzo baking done by the synagogue was prohibit by the authorities, as it was in many other parts of the Soviet Union. Use of the cemetery was also forbidden in 1963, and it was closed in 1969. Despite the overall level of assimilation of the Jewish community in the city, after the Six-Day War in the State of Israel, a number of youths in the community began to affiliate themselves with Israel and a Jewish national identity. There were Hebrew classes organized in secret and public protests over the government's refusal to let Jews emigrate to Israel, and a number of refusenik activists were jailed by the government. In 1970, an attempt by a group of young refuseniks, and two non-Jews, to hijack a plane from the city's airport and fly to Israel caught worldwide media attention. Two were sentenced to death, which sparked global outcry, and the capital sentences were eventually commuted. Just before the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Jewish mortality rate in the city exceeded the birthrate by a factor of more than 10, and two-thirds of newborns registered as Jewish had one parent whose nationality was not Jewish.  Russian Federation and today  Today, the Jewish community in the city is the second largest in Russia, after Moscow. The majority of the Jews there remain secular, but there is also an Orthodox community. While the Jewish population was 107,000 in 1989, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and mass migration of many Jews from Russia to Israel and the United States, the population declined dramatically. As of 2010, the Jewish population was about 40,000. The Yesod Jewish Community Center (JCC), opened in 2005, houses six of the cities Jewish organizations and offers cultural and educational programs. There is also a Holocaust memorial located in Tsarskoye Selo.

They are differentiated from the other tribe within that subfamily, the Brosmophycinae , by having a single pair of ossified genital claspers, having an absence or greatly reduced scales on the head and having the posterior end of the maxillary bone showing a small amount of vertical expansion. A review of the viviparous brotulas carried out in 2016 elevated the tribe to a family, the Dinematichthyidae.

Martin Schiele (17 January 1870 - 16 February 1939) was a German nationalist politician. Schiele was part of the leadership of the German National People's Party (DNVP) from its 1918 founding until Alfred Hugenberg became leader in 1928. He was also the chief representative of the agrarian wing of the DNVP.Dieter Gessner, 'Agrarian Protectionism in the Weimar Republic', Journal of Contemporary History, Vol. 12, No. 4 (Oct., 1977), p. 765. As a member of Hans Luther's coalition government Schiele secured the restoration of agricultural and industrial protectionism with the tariff of 1925.Gessner, p. 765. As Minister of Food in 1927-28, Schiele favoured state credit as a means for subsidising agriculture.Gessner, p. 766. He was persuaded by President Hindenburg to return as Minister of Food in Heinrich Br√ºning's cabinet.Larry Eugene Jones, 'German Conservatism at the Crossroads: Count Kuno von Westarp and the Struggle for Control of the DNVP, 1928-30', Contemporary European History, Vol. 18, No. 2 (May, 2009), p. 166. The Agricultural League under Schiele's leadership was criticised by Richard Walther Darr√©'s Nazi Agrarian Apparatus. Schiele ceased to be leader of the Agricultural League shortly after the 1930 election.Gessner, p. 771. Unhappy with Hugenberg's leadership, Schiele left the DNVP and moved closer to the Conservative People's Party.Jones, p. 174.

The Japanese Stamp Catalog Illustrated in Colors () (now Sakura Catalogue of Japanese Stamps ()) was first published in October 1967 with full-color illustrations, which surprised the philatelic world since a colored stamp catalog had never been thought of. Regarded as the most reliable and popular publication in Japan, it goes through fifteen editions in 1979, and more than 4,500,000 copies have been released in all. This is the companion volume to the Japanese Stamp Specialized Catalog. The catalog, nicknamed Sakura Catalog, has been in pocket-size (118 x 148 mm) for several years, but now it is printed in B6 (128 x 182 mm) size so that it can be printed using a multicolor rotary press to meet the increased circulation and to make the use of thinner paper possible. As all pages have to be composed anew for the enlarged size, English version of stamp names is added for the convenience of foreign collectors, and many symbols are used to facilitate their understanding how the stamps are classified here.

There are numerous rock formations along the canyon, including a number of caves. Located at the transition zone of the Adriatic Sea and Ionian Sea, the scenery is among the mosts visited attractions along the Albanian Riviera. Nonetheless, the canyon has been further recognised as an Important Plant Area of international importance by Plantlife, because it supports a number of rare and endemic species. In terms of phytogeography, the canyon belongs to the Illyrian province of the circumboreal region within the boreal Kingdom. It falls completely within the Illyrian deciduous forests terrestrial ecoregion of the Palearctic Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome. Among vegetation elements, the presence is extremely significant of the carob and olive, which has been produced since antiquity throughout the country. The specific landscape right beside the sea and the particular climate have favored the development of a vast array of faunal species that demonstrates an eminent quality. The canyon contains shallow coastal waters which provide sufficient habitat for the loggerhead sea turtle, the most familiar turtle in the Mediterranean Sea. Dolphins are not really that uncommon in the region.

Several Wikipedia policies and guidelines exist to combat conflict of interest editing, including Wikipedia:Conflict of interest and Wikipedia:Paid-contribution disclosure.

The media has also written about COI editing by BP, the Central Intelligence Agency, Diebold, Portland Communications, Sony, the Vatican, and several others. Republication of Wikimedia content In response to criticism about distributing misinformation, in 2018 YouTube announced a plan to match their videos to Wikipedia as a factchecking strategy. YouTube did not inform anyone in the Wikimedia Foundation that they were organizing this project. Critics questioned the fairness of YouTube and parent Google having a business model which shifts responsibility to Wikipedia's volunteer editors and does not apparently give back to that labor force. Facebook created a feature in 2018 to likewise use Wikipedia to counter fake news. Beginning in April, news articles posted to Facebook have had an information button directing the user to the news publisher's Wikipedia entry, among other background content. Due to this, Breitbart News and other right- wing media organizations criticized Facebook and Wikipedia, especially over perceived bias in the content of Wikipedia's article on Breitbart. Also due to Facebook's and Google's use of Wikipedia to counter fake news, the Wikimedia Foundation is planning to formally ask the companies for compensation for its services.

The present building was built between 1690 and 1726 on the site of an earlier church, and it was enlarged between 1938 and 1942. The church's interior was extensively decorated using locally-sourced travertine from cave deposits (commonly referred to as \\"onyx\\" or \\"alabaster\\") in the late 20th century. History The site of the building has been occupied by a church dedicated to the Assumption of Mary for centuries. The earliest known reference to a chapel is in a 1615 pastoral visit, and the Bishop of the time found it to be well-maintained. A larger chapel was constructed in around 1640‚Äì44, and it became the village's parish church when Bishop Davide Cocco Palmieri established ≈ªebbuƒ° as a parish on 28 April 1688. The existing building proved too small, and construction of the present church began in 1690. It was completed and consecrated on 30 September 1726. It was the first church in Gozo apart from the Cathedral to include aisles, and the building is one of the oldest parish churches on the island. The church was enlarged between 1938 and 1942. It was raised to Archipresbyteral status on 12 March 1963. The church interior was extensively decorated with \\"onyx\\" in the 1980s, with sculptural work being carried out by the master craftsman and designer Ronald Pisani. The church building is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. In 2019 major restoration work on the church's belfries began. Architecture The fa√ßade The church has a simple but elegant fa√ßade. The decorations consist of three sets of two pilasters, each of which are raised on a plinth. A portal containing the main doorway is located in the centre of the fa√ßade, between two of the pilasters. It is decorated with mouldings and it is topped by an inscription and a rounded pediment. A cornice runs along the entire fa√ßade, above which there is a wide entablature and two bell towers. In the centre of the upper part of the fa√ßade, there is a balcony with a niche of St. Mary, above which there is a triangular pediment. The church also includes a dome. The church's interior is extensively decorated with travertine from cave deposits, which is commonly referred to as \\"onyx marble\\" () or \\"Gozo alabaster\\", although these names are incorrect. A deposit of this stone was discovered in 1738 in a field in the area of Taƒã-ƒäaqra or Is-Sagƒßtrija on the outskirts of ≈ªebbuƒ°. In the 1980s, it was used to decorate most of the building interior, including the high altar, choir, baptistery and confessionals. The altar, with Pisani's sculpted chalice, loaves and grapes, is regarded as the main attraction of the church. Some of the \\"onyx\\" from ≈ªebbuƒ° was also used in other churches in the Maltese Islands, but not to the extent used in the ≈ªebbuƒ° parish church. Paintings and statues The titular painting of the church depicts the Holy Trinity crowning the head of the Blessed Virgin, and it was painted by Francesco de Dominics in the 1730s. The painting was crowned by Bishop Nikol Joseph Cauchi in August 1980. Other paintings in the church include the Nativity of Our Lady and the Presentation of Jesus in the Temple, which are both the work of Antonio Zammit done in 1850. The chapel in the left transept contains an altarpiece depicting the Immaculate Conception. Some people hold the painting to be miraculous, with Mary's face reportedly turning yellow or pale whenever a catastrophe is about to occur. According to legend, a woman resembling the figure in the painting also attacked corsairs who raided the countryside around ≈ªebbuƒ°. The chapel in the right transept contains a korpsant (a statue containing relics) of Saint Fortunatus, a Roman martyr whose body was brought from the Catacombs of Saint Agnes in Rome. The relic had belonged to the family of the politician Fortunato Mizzi, and they donated it to the parish in 1922. The titular statue of the Assumption was purchased from Gallard et Fils of Marseille in 1863, making it the oldest statue of the Assumption on Gozo. The church also includes a statue of Saint Anthony of Padua made in 1904, a statue of Saint Joseph made in 1906, and a statue of Saint Th√©r√®se of Lisieux made in 1922. A statue of Our Lady of the Rosary was blessed in 1919. The parish also owns a set of statues showing various episodes of the Passion of Jesus, which are used in the annual Good Friday procession.

Andrew Fisher was re- elected to the leadership, defeating William Higgs. It was the first occasion on which a sitting leader had faced a challenge. Fisher had been elected to the party leadership in 1907, in place of Chris Watson. After a brief period of governing in minority from 1908 to 1909, he led Labor to majority government for the first time at the 1910 election. However, his government was defeated by Joseph Cook's Liberal Party at the 1913 election. The party's loss of power after only a single term brought leadership tensions to the forefront, with James Catts one of the leading agitators. Those opposed to Fisher rallied behind William Higgs, a fellow Queenslander who had been a backbencher throughout the duration of the recent government. As expected, Fisher won an absolute majority on the first ballot. In his official history of the Labor Party, Ross McMullin states that caucus minutes recorded the result as 42 votes for Fisher, 18 for Higgs, and one for Billy Hughes (who did not actually nominate for the position). David Day, one of Fisher's biographers, also gives those figures. However, contemporary newspapers reported that only 57 members of the caucus were in attendance, and that Higgs had won 21 votes; Hughes was not mentioned as a candidate. The party's official announcement of the caucus proceedings made no mention of any challenge to Fisher, and the exact results did not become known to the general public until the following week, when they were leaked to the press by Labor MPs.

It was designed and built from 1862. It is also known as Savernake Homestead. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 March 2013. The heritage listing includes the station's moveable heritage, including significant collections and archives relating to the property.  History  Aboriginal land The Bangerang people used the River Murray as a thoroughfare and were famous for their bark canoes: the banks of the Murray today still have a relatively large number of older trees with the wood exposed where bark for canoes was cut out in the early nineteenth century or before [scar trees]. As late as 1848 the squatter E. M. Curr travelled on the river with an Aboriginal guide in a canoe with a traditional fire \\"burning on a hearth of clay in the bows\\" to grill fish or duck en route. > \\"The Bangerang found plentiful food, shellfish and Murray cod in the river > and fruit, tubers and nuts in the adjacent country. . . In 1845 the census > of Aborigines in the Murrumbidgee Pastoral District, which included the > Murray, estimated the total number as some two thousand. . . The large > middens along the river, on both banks, suggested that there had been in the > past a higher density population.\\" The dislocation by Europeans of normal Aboriginal routines of life was increasingly severe from the 1840s onwards, but already in the 1830s and probably earlier, European diseases, influenza, smallpox and syphilis, had taken a terrible toll of both Wiradjuri and Bangeran.' Some Aboriginal people adapted to the occupation of their land by working on the farms - in stockmen roles for men and domestic service and childcare roles for women. Colonisation - Mulwala Station Mulwala Homestead was founded as part of the process of pastoral development of the vast Riverina region. Squatters started moving into the eastern Riverina in the late 1820s as the area's pastoral potential was recognised by settlers. The region's Aboriginal inhabitants were displaced as the tide of settlement advanced. An early settler at Mulwala was George Hillas, but the central story of the property is that of the Sloane family. Alexander Sloane emigrated from Scotland to Australia in 1849. He married Annabella n√©e Gibson in 1856 and they had a family. In 1853 Sloane formed a pastoral company and in 1862 he purchased Savernake, north of Mulwala village, where he had nearly 5000 sheep by January 1863. In 1864 he purchased Mulwala Station from Hillas. Here the Sloanes lived in the slab hut built by Hillas, near a lagoon close to the Murray River, which they extended and they built other buildings. Then a flood came in 1867 causing much damage. The Sloanes moved some of the buildings to a higher site and these formed the genesis of the Mulwala homestead complex. Sheep numbers on Mulwala grew from 12,081 in 1865 to 60,604 by 1874, and the station attained a good reputation as a sheep stud. The 1890s depression, which ruined many properties, was weathered by the Sloanes, as Alexander turned to wheat farming to supplement the property's revenue, and he brought in share farmers. After Alexander's death in 1907, the property was divided up between his sons. One section of the Sloane family continued to live in the Mulwala homestead with its reduced lands adjoining Savernake but this property has been unoccupied since the mid-1960s. It was bought by the Department of Defence in the 1980s. With the buildings empty the Mulwala complex has deteriorated. A large and significant collection of archival material created throughout the Sloanes' occupation of Mulwala has been retained by the Sloane family branch at Savernake. Savernake Station Pastoral farmland at Savernake After Alexander Sloane's death in 1907 his five surviving sons each took over a portion of the family's consolidated holdings at Mulwala. One of the five sons, William Sloane (1860‚Äì1933) had married Jeanie Gordon (1875‚Äì1942) in London in 1898 and they took over the most northern part of the Mulwala Station, known as Savernake. Jeanie was an excellent amateur photographer whose detailed letters to her family in England about her experiences as a farmer's wife on this then remote Australian farm have been published by the Sloane family. Ian Sloane (1903‚Äì1986), son of William and Jeanie, was an accomplished photographer and award-winning filmmaker, specialising in rural documentaries. The video \\"Heritage Farming in Australia\\" contains movie footage shot by Ian Sloane which documents farming practice on Savernake Station in the 1930s. There is a particular focus on the 1935‚Äì36 season which was a bumper year for the property's cereal crops, culminating in the construction of a record 180-ton cereal haystack on Savernake Station which provided fodder for the next decade through four severe droughts. Alexander and Ann Sloane are the fourth generation of the Sloane family to live on and earn a living from Savernake Station, now reduced to . They have four adult children. They continue farming dryland cereals, winter pasture, hay, and raise prime lamb. They nurture the indigenous native vegetation, operate a Farmstay Cottage and day tours on the property. They are members of \\"Learning from Farmers\\", an informal network of farmers across the Murray catchment who encourage others to adopt sustainable native vegetation within agricultural enterprises. Alexander's sister Helen Huggins also owns areas of Savernake Station, and operates her agricultural business independently. She has re- established the historic Mulwala Merino Stud, begun on the Savernake property in 1863. She produces wool and dryland cereals, and resides at \\"Woodpark\\", Jerilderie with her husband, Owen.A. Sloane email communication, 18/10/12 ;Comparisons with similar properties Savernake Station is comparable with \\"Meroogal\\", Nowra, which dates from 1886, in that both homesteads were occupied by the one family over a long period of time and both properties retain substantial records and decipherable layers in their built fabric. As with the Savernake Station homestead, the pattern of living at Meroogal was first laid down in the 1880s, and repeated by successive generations. Furniture, household objects, letters, diaries, photographs and clothing, have remained at Meroogal, allowing insights into the personal lives of the occupants and permitting the understanding of the contribution made by each generation. The gardens of both homesteads have changed little since the 1920s. Both properties have undergone physical changes over the decades, but these have not obscured the early history. Rather, they have provided a demonstration of the different layers of history. Meroogal is listed on the State heritage register (SHR) and is owned by the Historic Houses Trust which runs it as a house museum. Ben Chifley's House in Bathurst, dating from the 1880s, also compares to Savernake Station because of its moveable heritage still remaining in its original place of context. Chifley's House is listed on the SHR and owned by Bathurst Regional Council which runs it as a house museum. Tocal Homestead, Paterson in the Hunter Valley, is comparable with Savernake Station for its collection of colonial farm buildings, such as homestead, manager's cottage, barn, and range of outbuildings and stockyards. As with Savernake, Tocal is still a functioning farm, and operates a tourism enterprise. While its buildings are more architecturally remarkable, including an early colonial barn built by convicts in the 1830s, a fine double-storey Regency homestead building from the 1840s, a barn designed by Edmund Blacket in the 1860s and an important collection of vernacular timber buildings, the property does not retain a comprehensive moveable heritage collection associated with the historic running of the farm.  Description  Property 400-year-old tree surrounded by its children Scar tree at Savernake Savernake Station is situated north of the Mulwala Station. Alexander Sloane acquired the lease of Savernake Station, then being , in 1862. In 1864 he acquired the lease of the adjoining Mulwala Station and operated them as one unit. Now comprising , Savernake Station has been in continuous agricultural and pastoral use by the Sloane family (now fourth generation). The property retains both cultural and natural remnants of its long history, including many examples of farm machinery. There is an indigenous species-rich and pristine box (Eucalyptus sp.)-cypress pine (Callitris sp.) woodland forest with 400-year-old trees. This area of is highly regarded among environmentalists for its pristine condition and species richness including at least 120 species, 250 flora species, 20 mammal species, 15 reptile species, amphibians and innumerable insects. This site has been used for research by PhD students, tertiary students, community projects, Landcare workshops and environmental staff training seminars. Considered significant. The property was part of the land of the Pangerang Aboriginal people and there is evidence of approximately six canoe / scar trees adjacent to the ephemeral creekline, and extensive areas of middens and oven mounds. \\"Situated along an ephemeral creek line, mounds occur up to from the watercourse. They are approximately 6m in diameter, and high, spaced about apart or superimposed on older specimens. Some have rare stone artefacts either on the surface or embedded in the mounds. Cultural material is likely buried within the mounds. This semi-continuous mound formation appears to be huge. This would mean thousands of earth ovens are present in this area.\\" Considered significant. Buildings Homestead *1876 - Selector's Hut: is an example of wattle and daub pioneering architecture, with the use of interlinked horizontal cypress pine logs, the gaps being filled with mud. Considered significant. *1886 - Homestead with 1911 additions and Servants' Quarters to rear and associated outbuildings. Has been modified over many years of family occupation and indicates how the development of the station progressed. Now a privately run house museum. Considered highly significant in association with the moveable heritage collections held there. *1880s - Boundary Rider's Hut is an example of simple pioneering construction for the accommodation of temporary pastoral staff. Considered significant. *1890s - Machinery Shed, with 20 agricultural implements and 4 horse-drawn vehicles. Considered significant. *1902 - White Well, near the Settler's Hut. 30m hand dug well, retaining internal timbers.

Considered significant. *1980s - \\"Little Creek\\" residence. Considered non-significant for heritage purposes. Moveable heritage Quote from the NSW Department of Housing and Construction, for the Department of Defence: ;The equipment and machinery associated with specific buildings and sites on the property. Considered highly significant. Farm machinery shed A fair proportion of these objects are original to specific sites and are located in situ - for example, the 1948 Ronaldson and Tippet power generating plant in the homestead powerhouse; the c 1912 grindstone at the woolshed; four old bu presentable Peugeots in a shed near the Homestead and the 1926 petrol pump also near the homestead (under a shelter), identified as a LASCO Larkins Aircraft Supply, understood to be the only working original example in Australia.. Other objects are located at sites with which they are primarily associated e.g. the Clayton and Shuttleworth steam engine no 27258 used to provide power to the woolshed from 1912 to 1938 and the c.1860s grindstone moved from Mulwala Station woolshed. ;The collection of tools, general farming hardware and domestic equipment associated with the running of the station since 1862. Considered highly significant. This collection is considerable in size and scope. In some sections of the historic buildings (e.g. the Shearers' mess), displays of heritage tools and equipment illustrate many of the activities which would have been undertaken in previous decades. For example, two of the leather fire beaters shown in use to fight a grass fire in the film Heritage Farming in Australia are on display, as is the Petzke bag filler also shown in use in the film. Similarly, one of the \\"bedrooms\\" in the Shearers' Quarters has been furnished as it would have been if two shearers were in residence in the 1930s. The storeroom in the homestead kitchen/servants quarters building dates to 1900 and displays dry goods packaging and domestic paraphernalia.< ;The Savernake Station and Sloane Family Archives. Considered highly significant. Grandmother's diaries held at Savernake The family archives consist of farm diaries, business documents, account books, correspondence, papers and magazines. These are extensive and are stored primarily in two shipping containers and the small machinery shed. While some documents have been given to the Riverina Archives at the Charles Sturt University, Wagga Wagga (and copies made for the Savernake holdings) this does not diminish the overall comprehensiveness of this archive as a record of the \\"social, economic and management history of the homestead and property complex\\". The material ranges from the personal (e.g. the farm daily diaries of Alexander Sloane amounting to 44 volumes and letters written by his wife Annabella and William Sloane's wife Jeanie), to documents and magazines which illustrate the developments and setbacks experienced by pioneering farmers like Alexander and his descendants as they continued the family tradition of farming in the Riverina. vThese include hundreds of letters dealing with the NSW Selection era and Acts of 1860-1880s. ;The photographic collections associated with Savernake. Considered highly significant. Homestead interior with moveable heritage The photographic collections merit specific distinction as they provide a vivid and detailed record of Savernake Station as a working property, of the life of the Sloane family and of the district. The most accomplished of the Sloane family photographers was Ian Fyfe Sloane whose legacy is represented by an extensive collection of his photographs, negatives and movie films as well as reel to reel tapes and, his darkrooms and photographic equipment (note in 1986, Ian Sloane's reel to reel tape collection provided the ABC with recordings of Blue Hills which were not in the ABC archives). This collection is an outstanding series of photographic essays of farming life in still and movie images. Movie footage contained in DVDs \\"Heritage Farming in Australia\\" and 'Australia's Pastoral Heritage' has received international awards from USA and Europe, as well as accolades from National Film and Sound Archives in Canberra and Melbourne. The collection includes unique colour footage of entire length of Murray River 1953‚Äì55. At the launch of the video \\"Heritage Farming in Australia\\" Dr Jeff Brownrigg of the National Film and Sound Archive, Canberra, stated \\"What we have in his work is a time capsule, a record of a vanished way of doing things\\". Ian's extensive production of still photographs was the \\"foundation\\" for Alex and Ann Sloane's publication \\"Heritage Farming in Australia\\", 1998. Ian Sloane began taking photographs at an early age as his mother Jeanie Sloane was a keen amateur photographer. At least one of her albums is on display in the homestead and the images offer a woman's perspective on life at Savernake Station. ;Collections linked to particular family members. Considered highly significant. In addition to the Ian Sloane photographic collection, Alex and Ann Sloane have described collections linked to three family members. These are: #The rifle heritage of William Sloane (grandfather of 2012 occupant) consisting of awards, medals, insignia, rifles, trophies, letters and diaries. William competed at the international Bisley competition in 1897 1898, then was part of the Australian team in 1902. He also represented his country in New Zealand competitions. The team was victorious in 1897 and 1902. He was instrumental in modernizing the Victorian Defences with the appropriate rifle. His part in riflemen history has been documented in \\"The Bisley Boys\\" by Andrew Kilsby, 2008. These objects are on display in the 1886 timber panelled homestead dining room. #The aviation heritage of William Douglas Sloane (uncle of 2012 occupant) including a 1912 bi-plane built by WD Sloane, his World War I correspondence, artefacts and photographs. These objects are housed in the Pioneer Museum, Mulwala. #The entomological heritage of Thomas Gibson Sloane (great uncle of 2012 occupant) who was an internationally recognised entomologist specialising in ground beetles ‚Äì his extensive collection of beetles is housed at the CSIRO as is his portrait as a pioneer entomologist. He is noted in the Australian Dictionary of Biography. While this collection is not housed at Savernake and presumably is not part of the Movable Heritage under threat of dispersal, it is important to record it as part of the total Sloane family heritage. His 'Sloane's Tables of Tribes' still forms the basis of entomological classification to this day. ;Aboriginal heritage of Savernake Station documenting contact between Sloane family members and the local Pangerang tribe and the movable heritage of the Pangerang tribe. Considered highly significant. The collection includes spears, boomerangs, a woomera, stones, sacred stones and artefacts from the Boat Rock well on the property. Second generation pioneer William Sloane was a friend of the tribe and in particular of \\"Wellington\\" who taught William how to make boomerangs. 'An example of a boomerang made of Scottish ash by William on a visit to Scotland is on display in the former kitchen (Natural History Museum) wing of the Homestead, along with a selection of other Aboriginal artefacts including the last boomerang made by \\"Wellington\\". ;Sloane family movable heritage reflecting interest in the local fauna and family memorabilia and curios on display in the family \\"museum\\". (Sanders) Considered highly significant. Members of the family collected and taxidermied some local species in the 1870s ‚Äì reptiles, mammals and birds. There is also William Howard Sloane's Birds' Egg Collection of 1910s, the 1882 skull of first rabbit in Mulwala district, and a section of the spar from the wreck of the ship \\"Loch Ard\\", as well as other unique memorabilia such as the hide and head of a cheetah shot in India by a Russian nobleman who married into the Sloane family.Sloane SHR nomination, 2010 There are also family portraits, antique Scottish furniture, gigs, and horse-drawn vehicles, early agricultural machinery, 1895 portable steam engine, 1948 Ronaldson & Tippet 110 volt power plant in original shed, 1930s Macdonald diesel engine, 1925 wool press, 1920s petrol bowser, assorted items in private museum and 1900s store room.  Condition  As at 4 September 2012, the machinery, collections and natural forest were intact and in good condition. The condition of the buildings is fair to very good, however maintenance is continual. The environment comprises highly intact natural forest, farm buildings, machinery and heritage collections.  Modifications and dates  *1886 Homestead: 1911; 1953. *1912 Overseer's Cottage: 1978. *1876 Selector's Hut: 1920s.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Savernake Station and Movable Heritage is of State significance for its research potential to contribute to our understanding of pioneer pastoral and agricultural life from the perspective of the Sloane family who have continuously farmed this land since 1862. It is also of State historic, aesthetic, rarity and representational significance. The property includes a 'selector's hut' dating from 1876 and a homestead dating from 1886, as well as associated farm outbuildings including servants' quarters, overseer's cottage, woolshed and shearers' quarters from the early twentieth century. The property is also rare for including of undisturbed, indigenous woodlands including Aboriginal canoe / scar trees, middens and earth ovens. The place is most remarkable for its moveable heritage collection which includes farm machinery, domestic wares, written records and high quality film and photography of the farm under cultivation. The depth, breadth and detail of the archives and photography collections comprehensively document the operations and management of the property and the family's life over successive generations. The significance of the movable heritage collection is considerably enhanced by its historical and continuing association with the extant buildings, sites, operations and family occupation of the place. These items provide valuable illustrations of the developments of farming technology and practice over time and in response to environmental conditions as well as market demands and developing infrastructure. \\"The historical material available on the social, economic and management history of the homestead and property complex is comparable to the largest and most intact collections of this kind in Australia\\". Savernake Station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 March 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Savernake Station and Moveable Heritage is of state significance for its historical demonstration of the colonisation of the Riverina, being the northern tip of the Mulwala Homestead established by Alexander Sloane on the Murray River in 1862. Savernake Station, now comprising is still in continuous agricultural and pastoral use by a branch of the Sloane family (the fourth generation). It retains both cultural and natural remnants of its long history, including many examples of farm buildings and machinery and a pristine, indigenous pine forest with 400-year-old trees. Its moveable heritage collection is of state historical significance for its comprehensive documentation of the Sloane family presence and history on their holdings and in the district. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Savernake Station is likely to be of local significance for its associations with the Sloane family, a prominent local pastoral family who have been in continuous occupation of the property since 1862. Many members of the Sloane family have made contributions to Australian cultural and scientific life including: William Sloane who was a champion shooter and rifle collector, Thomas Gibson Sloane who documented and collected insects, Ian Fyfe Sloane who was an award-winning photographer in both still and moving images and William Douglas Sloane who contributed to Australian aviation by building and flying his own wooden aeroplane on Dicks Plain at Mulwala Station in 1912. It is also of significance for its associations with the indigenous people who lived there, especially the elder known as Wellington who formed a friendship with William Sloane, son of the pioneering Alexander Sloane. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The movable heritage collection at Savernake Station is of state significance as an outstanding collection of items which demonstrate both representative and innovative technological developments in the design and production of machinery for Australian agriculture and pastoralism over 150 years. Such innovations helped farmers like the Sloane family to develop a largely sustainable way of life despite the challenges such as drought and the long-term effects of the early, inappropriate methods of soil management. The photographic archives detail much of the machinery developed on the farm, often showing technology in use. The photographic collection is itself of state aesthetic significance, notably the Ian Fyfe Sloane collection of photographs, negatives, movie films and reel to reel tapes, as an \\"outstanding series of photographic essays of farming life in still and movie images\\". His movie footage contained in documentaries \\"Heritage Farming in Australia\\" and 'Australia's Pastoral Heritage' has received international awards as well as accolades from the Australian National Film and Sound Archives. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Movable Heritage collection of Savernake Station is likely to be of local social significance to the people of Corowa Shire as an unusually detailed and comprehensive record of a farming family's occupation of the land since it was granted. It is likely to contribute to understandings of not only the Sloane family's role over time but also their interaction with the surrounding community including neighbours and also those involved through work and business with the operation of the property over several generations. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Savernake Station and Moveable Heritage is of state significance for its archaeological and research potential to increase understanding of both Aboriginal occupation of the land and the subsequent colonisation of the land since the 1860s. The comprehensiveness of the Sloane family and property archives and records of their farming activities, methods of farming and land management over several generations ensures there will be information which will add to understanding of the area's natural and cultural history, for example, the comprehensive record of rainfall noted daily between 1862 and 1986. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Savernake Station and Moveable Heritage is of state significance as a rare surviving and intact example of a \\"pastoral complex\\" operating between the 1880s and 1950 in the Riverina. The site is also rare as it contains 400 hectares of natural \\"undisturbed\\" indigenous woodlands and Aboriginal canoe / scar trees and other relics. The moveable heritage collection is rare for its longitudinal comprehensiveness and its continuing association with the family and land to which it relates, making it \\"comparable to the largest and most intact collections of this kind in Australia\\". The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Savernake Station and Moveable Heritage, with its surviving indigenous woods and Aboriginal relics, its historic complex of buildings and pastoral lands, its associated movable heritage collection including extensive and comprehensive family and property records, is of state significance for representing the development of a pastoral property in NSW from its infancy in the 1860s to the present The still-used woolshed with its timber \\"drop plank\\" walls and the shearers' complex of buildings with their movable heritage collection in-situ are an excellent illustration of the role of sheep breeding in the Riverina. The fact that most if not all the fabric at Savernake is in unrestored condition adds to its heritage value. The moveable heritage collection as a whole and especially through the family records and photographic and documentary archives is of state significance as an representative record of not only the Sloane family's continuing enterprise and success as pastoralists but also of all the people associated with the property through employment, contracting, business, supply and sharefarming.

Padewakang were used for long distance voyages serving the south Sulawesi kingdoms.  Etymology  No-one quite seems to know the origin of the name padewakang, though some have suggested that it stems from Dewakang Island, an important navigational landmark between Sulawesi and Java. Dutch records from the 1735 mention letters from Sulawesi arriving in Batavia ‚Äòper Paduakkang‚Äô.Nationaal Archief Nederland, 1.04.02.8207: 13 According to Horridge, the words padewakang, paduwakang (Sulawesi) and paduwang (Madura) have its roots from word wa, wangka, waga, wangga, and bangka of Austronesian languages. The term is associated with outrigger perahu or small perahu.  Description  A padewakang at Makassar, date unknown. It typically weights between 20 and 50 tons, had one or two masts with tanja sails. Like other traditional vessels of the archipelago, it is steered using two quarter rudders. Between the end of the 16th century to early 20th century they routinely sailed for the coasts of northern Australia in search of teripang (sea cucumbers), armed with cannon of ancient origin, probably cetbang or lantaka. Padewakang were the biggest craft of South Sulawesi as trading vessel and as war fleets, used for hundreds of years sailing the seas between western New Guinea, the southern parts of the Philippines, and the Malay Peninsula. There is even a Dutch publication of padewakang under full sail in the Persian Gulf. They are used until the production stopped in favor of the famous Palari by the 20th century. The palari evolved from basic padewakang hull with fore-and-aft sails to its own hull model with indigenous \\"pinisi rig\\".2004 Horst H. Liebner, Malayologist, Expert Staff of the Agency for Marine and Fisheries Research, Department of Marine Affairs and Fisheries of the Republic of Indonesia H. Warington Smyth described a large 2-masted padewakang built of giam wood. The dimension is as follows: 99 ft (30.2 m) long, 15 ft (4.6 m) wide, 12 ft (3.7 m) depth, 6 ft 3 inch (1.91 m) freeboard. The capacity was 60 koyan (145 metric tons), with 60 ft (18.3 m) mainmast, crewed by 16 men.  Evolution to Palari-Pinisi  According to Horst Liebner, a Mandar maritime expert, pinisi sail originally mounted onto the hull of a padewakang and similar boats; however, when the sailors and craftsmen are increasingly aware of the way they are used, they selected only the palari (derived from lari - \\"to run\\") hull - a very pointed hull type and it is indeed the one that best suits the schooner sail. This evolution takes place in several stages: The hull type is designed with more pointed and enhanced with some additional boards that causing the deck of the bow becomes lower than the main deck and the stern, and that the construction of the rolling beams seems to 'fly' behind stern boat (Konjo language: palari salompong ambeng rua kali); the next part of the stern deck (ambeng) is continued until the steering beams merge with it (palari salompong); and the last step is to increase the bow height so that the entire deck becomes straight. This last type of hull is used until the pinisi boat is replaced with PLM (motorized sailboat) type. In the early 1970s thousands of pinisi- palari ships measuring up to 200 tonnes of cargo, the world's largest commercial sailing fleet at the time, had contacted all corners of the Indian Ocean and became the trading backbone of the people.  Replica  * One replica named \\"Hati Marege\\" (Heart of Arnhem Land) is exhibited in Northern Territory Museum of Arts & Gallery.

It was designed by John Whitton in his capacity as Engineer-in-Chief for Railways and built from 1881 to 1889. It is also known as the Bredbo Rail Bridge and the Bredbo River Railway Viaduct. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The railway was extended from Queanbeyan to Cooma in 1887-89. At that time, the Engineer-in-Chief for Railways, John Whitton, was under government pressure to reduce construction costs. One common method was to build timber bridges, mostly ballast top timber bream bridges. However, for two major waterways, Ingalara Creek (Michelago Rail Bridge over Ingalara Creek and the Bredbo River, he chose to use Queen post deck trusses, a type of timber truss viaduct that he had already used on the Main North line between Glen Innes and Wallangarra. Nearer to Cooma, at Chakola, he chose a different type of timber viaduct to cross Umaralla Creek. Several of Whitton's other Queen post deck truss bridges - the Breardy River, Severn River and Bluff River viaducts and the Tenterfield Creek bridge - are also listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register.  Description  The Bredbo Rail Bridge is a ten-span timber truss viaduct. Each span is , centre to centre, of timber trestles. The Queen deck truss design was copied from one of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Cornish timber bridges, the St Germans viaduct, which was built about 30 years earlier. The condition of the bridge was reported as fair as at 4 April 2006 due to lack of maintenance since rail services were suspended. All these viaducts retain their original fabric.  Heritage listing  The timber Queen post truss viaduct was an economic bridge for the Queanbeyan to Cooma Railway at a time when the boom years of the 1880s were ending and funding for railway construction was decreasing. The Bredbo viaduct is accessible from the Monaro Highway and is an impressive timber structure. The Cooma Railway made a significant contribution to the development of the Monaro Region from the time of its construction 1887-89, and all the timber viaducts were important items of the railway's infrastructure. The timber Queen post deck viaduct was a significant structure in place of the expensive iron lattice bridges preferred by John Whitton. The Bredbo viaduct was technically sound and durable, having been built from renowned ironbark hardwood. The two deck Queen post truss timber viaducts on the Cooma Line, together with four on the Main North Line, are a unique class of railway bridge. Bredbo Rail Bridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The timber Queen post truss viaduct was an economic bridge for the Queanbeyan to Cooma Railway at a time when the boom years of the 1880s were ending and funding for railway construction was decreasing. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The viaduct is accessible from the Monaro Highway and is an impressive timber structure. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Cooma Railway made a significant contribution to the development of the Monaro Region from the time of its construction 1887-89, and the three timber viaducts were important items of the railway's infrastructure.

The church is administered by the Diocese of Sodor and Man.http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/parishes/as/andreas.htm History It is generally supposed that Christianity was introduced to the Isle of Man by St Patrick about the middle part of the 5th Century and that St German was appointed as the first Bishop of Man.Manks Ecclesiastical Antiquities: Manks Advertiser, Thursday, August 31, 1826; Page: 4 Under the influence of St Patrick and what is referred to as his \\"Romish missionaries,\\" the Isle of Man saw the erection of a series of small chapels throughout the Island. One such was Cabbal Vaartyn (which translates as Martin's Chapel) and which stood on what today is the road between Andreas and The Lhen. The chapel was dedicated to St Martin, Bishop of Tours, an uncle of St Patrick who is said to of been a man of eminent piety. Sometime between the years 1270 and 1344, when the Isle of Man was under the dominion of the Scots, parishes were created which in turn saw the erection of a church within Andreas and dedicated to St Andrew, the Patron Saint of Scotland and from whom the name Andreas translates. By 1800 the old church was in a poor state of repair, and on 19 February 1800 a special vestry meeting was held, attended by John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl, at which it was decided to build a new parish church; however building work did not start for several years after the 1800 Act of Tynwald. Much of the cost was covered by donations and contributions, with the short-fall being met by holders of Quarterlands, cottages and Intacks in the parish with the amounts paid being levied by Church Wardens and Sidemen. The Chancel was paid for by the Rector which was customary at that time. The church was constructed by Mr Radcliffe of Andreas, the father of Reverend W.T. Radcliffe. As there is no quarry in the parish, stone was sourced from Sulby Glen and many of the slates from the old church were reused on the new construction in order to keep costs down. The bell tower of St Andrew's Church as originally constructed.Kirk Andreas Church (reduced tower) During the war years an electric blower for the church organ was donated by serving personnel at RAF Andreas. Tower When the church was rebuilt the spire was situated at the western end, however various improvements were made over the years. The roof was raised and between 1867 & 1869 the tower at the western end was demolished and a new one built alongside the church. The foundation stone was laid by Mrs Francis Hall (widow of Archdeacon Hall) on 30 May 1867. The tower was originally in height. Connected to the main building by an arch it was a striking feature and visible all across the northern plain of the Isle of Man. The west end of the church was extended to include new entrances on the north and south sides, with a central stairway to the gallery. The work was completed in August 1869 following which Archdeacon Moore gave a supper for all the workmen. A large bell was housed in the tower and granite circles and shapes were made from a split farm roller which was given to the builders for the purpose. With the opening of RAF Andreas in 1941, the Air Ministry was given permission to cut down the flagpole on top of the tower and to replace it with an obstruction light.Isle of Man Examiner, Friday, September 14, 1945; Section: Front page, Page: 1 The tower was later reduced by removing the middle section on the orders of the Air Ministry. The numbered stones were stored and were originally intended to be restored at the end of the war. However the restoration never took place, and the stones mysteriously disappeared. War Memorial, St Andrew's Church, Andreas War Memorial Another prominent feature of the church is the Andreas War Memorial commemorating those lost from the parish during both World Wars.http://www.imuseum.im/search/collections/places/mnh-site-213764.html Designed by Cosmo Kendall, an inhabitant of the parish, the war memorial was erected by 85 parishioners who gave their time voluntarily. The entire cost of materials came from voluntary subscriptions from within the parish. Constructed from 132 tons of red sandstone, the obelisk stands at . It is mounted with five slate plaques with a cross at the top of the structure. Military graves at St Andrews Church, Andreas The memorial was unveiled on Sunday 9 November 1924, the ceremony being performed by Mrs J. Christian and Mrs T. Crowe, each of whom had lost two sons in the Great War. The memorial was dedicated by Archdeacon J. Kewley. Military graves Within a specified area of the churchyard are 23 military graves, the responsibility of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. These include pilots of No. 457 Squadron RAAF, No. 452 Squadron RAAF, the Fleet Air Arm and trainees of No. 11 Air Gunnery School. In addition there are the graves of the Commanding Officer of RAF Andreas, Wing Commander Teddy Knowles DFC, and Major Geoffrey Waite MC of the Wiltshire Regiment who was in charge of airfield defence and who was killed alongside Wing Commander Knowles following the crash of Armstrong- Whitworth Whitley BD417 on 23 August 1942.

The migrants were supported and protected by the officers of the British East India Company. The process of settlements started in the 19th century after the British East India company annexed Assam and established Colonial Assam.

Soon other bakers followed, establishing a number of bakeries throughout Assam. The first settler in Nagaon was Amiruddin Bepari. The settlement of people from Dhaka increased in 1905 when the East Bengal and Assam province was created. The British Raj built railway lines connecting Assam with East Bengal. In the early 20th century most the migrants from Dhaka were Hindus. Many of whom established ayurvedic shops throughout Assam. Paresh Chandra Banik was the first to settle in the city of Silchar.

She studied philology, and specialized in the literature of the middle ages and early modern Europe. Her research work has primarily focused on narrative strategies in different literary periods, but she became famous for her late work on the Spanish Black Legend.  Formative years and career  Born in El Borge (province of M√°laga) in 1966, she earned a licentiate degree in Spanish Philology and later obtained a master's degree in Medieval Literature, and a PhD in Classical Philology at the University of Malaga. She has worked for the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), and has taught at Harvard University in the United States. She is the author of several scholarly publications regarding, mainly, rhetoric and the construction of images and discourses through theatre and literature.Empire Phobia and Black Legend. (n.d.)Elvira Roca Barea: \\"Es un milagro que Espa√±a siga existiendo\\". (n.d.) She works as highschool teacher at the IES Huerta Alta in Alhaur√≠n de la Torre. Empire-phobia and Black Legend (2016) Her most recent publication, the peer-reviewed book \\"Imperiofobia y leyenda negra: Roma, Rusia, Estados Unidos y el Imperio espa√±ol\\" (Empire-phobia and Black Legend: Rome, Russia, United States and the Spanish Empire). The book is an essay, with a preface that declares that the author doesn't plan on being exhaustive but on putting forward the lesser known information about various empires and their ideological rivals. Roca Barea coins the term \\"empire- phobia\\" to refer to a characteristic, repetitive process of demonization through distortion and magnification that all multi-cultural empires suffer by neighboring nations, given certain circumstances, and that follows a consistent pattern. She argues that the Spanish Black Legend is not a unique phenomenon, but a particularly persistent case of this broader phenomenon, which also affected other empires like ancient Rome and Ottoman Turkey, and is now affecting the modern United States, especially in the Islamic world. In her book she offers a definition of both \\"empire\\" and \\"black legend\\". She then shows the common elements and strategies shared by this discourse across nations and times, by deconstructing and exposing the similarities between the anti-American, anti-Russian, anti-Roman and anti-Spanish propaganda produced by their respective contemporaries, as well as the similarities in how the empires responded‚Äîor rather, did not respond.MER Barea Imperiofobia y leyenda negra‚Äîeditorial Siruela-Madrid, 2016 This book has seen 18 editions in Spanish but has still to be translated to English.  Fracasolog√≠a  Continuing with the Roca Barea's main idea about the French and English hostility towards the Spanish Empire, her second book, Fracasolog√≠a, is dedicated to the discredit of the Spanish intellectuals since the moment that, according to Roca Barea, the onset of the Bourbon dynasty and the 18th century allegedly \\"incrustated among the Spaniards the self-contempt and acritical admiration for the modernity\\". According to Jos√©-Carlos Mainer, Barea argues in the work that self-criticism would be something exclusive of Spaniards and that, somewhat, it would be also a bad trait (a \\"sin\\"). Awards In 2018 she was awarded the Medal of Andalusia and Medal of Honor of San Telmo awarded by the Andalusian government. In 2019, Roca-Barea's \\"Imperiophobia and Leyenda Negra\\" won the Espasa-Calpe Award for works of literature, journalism and thought, awarded annually since 1984. According to the jury her work was \\"a magnificent essay, a brave revision which changes the traditional image of the history of Spain and the understanding that we Spaniards have of ourselves.\\" Praise and Criticism Peruvian Nobel Prize Winner, Mario Vargas Llosa begins his review of the book (September, 2018) with the following statement: '''' The historian Fernando Garc√≠a de Cort√°zar, Professor of Contemporary History at the University of Deusto and director of the Vocento Foundation and National History Prize 2008, believes that with Elvira Roca's work '''' Manuel Lucena Giraldo, historian and PhD in History of America, CSIC researcher specializing in Comparative Studies of the Caribbean and Atlantic World, highlights that the best aspect of the essay is that Elvira Roca provides alternative data and arguments that allow numerous gaps to be opened to the negative story of history from Spain concluding that the black legend grows as a result of the Spanish complexes and the drive of Catholic self- humiliation.https://www.abc.es/cultura/cultural/abci-mentiras-leyenda-negra-y- decadencia-espana-201707210206_noticia.html , Chair of Early Modern History at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and author of La leyenda negra: historia y opini√≥n (1992), argues that the Western world currently has a much more positive view of Spain and Spanish history than Roca Barea argues. According to him, it is not possible to currently find any European or American historian with scientific credit buying into the extremes of the so- called Leyenda negra (\\"Black Legend\\") i.e. exaggerated numbers of executed during the inquistion or the catastrophism of the demographic collapse of the Americas. He points out that such exaggerations and distortions have already been de-constructed precisely by European and American hispanists such as Elliott, Parker, Benassar or Vincent. Historian Miguel Mart√≠nez, from the University of Chicago, declares discomfort with her presentation of empires as \\"victims\\" instead of aggressors. He has criticizedMiguel Mart√≠nez: \\"El imperio del extremo centro\\" Elvira Roca's Imperiofobia arguing that while it is well documented it also contains key historical omissions and presents ideological bias. Mart√≠nez objects that Roca systematically omits relevant data contradicting her vision of the Spanish Empire as lenient and without conflict. Jos√© Luis Villaca√±as authored Imperiofilia y el populismo nacional- cat√≥lico (Lengua de Trapo, 2019), with the purpose of being a refutation of Imperiofobia. According to Villaca√±as, Imperiofobia lacks intellectual rigour and is alien to the parametres of \\"historical and academic research\\", featuring a brand of \\"reactionary intellectual populism\\". Villaca√±as considers the underlying interest in the work of Barea to be the underpinning of an ancient metaphysical struggle between Catholicism (identified by Barea with \\"Spain\\") and protestantism (with Barea adopting an anglophobic, germanophobic, dutchphobic vision of history, albeit, in a renovated vision of the myth of the \\"Hispanidad\\", not a frontal Anti-US sentiment). Regarding Fracasolog√≠a, Jos√©-Carlos Mainer considers the Roca Barea's work to be blind to the whole renovation of the literary historiography dealing with the century of Enlightenment that has taken place in the last six decades, as Roca Barea would \\"not be giving a damn about all that historians and philologists have written about the 18th-century in Spain\\". When it comes to literary style, Mainer describes the prose in Fracasolog√≠a as \\"capricious and impulsive\\", sprinkled with an \\"abundant\\" yet \\"arbitrary\\" bibliography with quite an amount of mistakes.

CudaText supersedes its predecessor SynWrite, which is not actively developed anymore.  The Core Program  The core program (i.e. without add-ons/plug-ins) is written in Object Pascal on the Lazarus IDE, which results in low resource requirements and the availability of native builds for FreeBSD, Linux, macOS and Windows. The settings are stored in JSON-files, including one file for the standard settings and another one for user-altered settings, that override the values from the standard settings file.  Add-on System and Python  CudaText has a similar add-on system like Sublime Text or Atom. It is based on Python (version 3.5 or newer). On Windows, Python engine is shipped with the program. On Unix-based systems, in order to make use of add-ons, Python has to be installed. The macOS doesn't include it, so it has to be downloaded and installed separately. On macOS the package including the 32-bit version is required. Also CudaText's Check for updates function requires Python.  Types of Add-ons  CudaText has (for July 2019) 13 types of add-ons: * Code tree icons: Icon set, which is used in Code Tree panel. * File-type icons: Icon set, which is used in Project Manager panel and on tab captions. * Toolbar theme: Icon set, which is used on horizontal toolbar. * Toolbar x icons: Icon set, from which user can choose icons for user-added buttons. * Sidebar theme: Icon set, which is used on sidebar. * Lexer: Data file to support syntax highlighting for some language. * Plugin: Any Python-based extension. * Snippets: Set of files, which adds code \\"snippets\\" for some language, used with Snippets plugin. * Color theme: Set of colors for CudaText interface and its lexers. * Translation: Data file to support app localization to some language. * Linter: Sub-plugin for CudaLint plugin, which enables linting (source code checking) for some language. * Formatter: Sub-plugin for CudaFormatter plugin, which allows to re-format text for some language. * Tree helper: Plugin, which shows Code Tree structure for some language.  Examples of Add-ons  = Plug-in: CudaLint = This is the linting framework, which is the host for second level plugins, \\"linters\\". Each linter is capable to check validity of source code for some syntax. For example, linter based on CppCheck is capable to check C++ source code. Linters analyze source code and find errors/warning in it, and framework displays these warning in the CudaText bottom panel, and adds colored bookmarks for them. Initially, the framework was made based on Sublime Linter plugin for Sublime Text 3. Linters require additional command-line tools installed, e.g. CppCheck, CssLint and others. Sometimes, they require Node.js package. = Plug-in: Sync_Scroll = Since July 2018 CudaText has a sync scroll plug-in. This plug-in allows parallel scrolling through two text files with synchronised lines, i.e. two tabs in different vertical or horizontal groups display always the lines with the same numbers. This feature is useful for manual comparisons of two files (manual diff) and quite indispensable for manually annotating parallel text corpora. = Plug-in: Text_Statistics = The text statistics plug-in is a tool for linguists. It displays the number of lines, words, letters and all characters as well as the 30 most common words and the sentences with n words, i.e. a short statistic of the number of sentences with 1 to 9 elements. Feature List * Syntax highlighting for all common languages: C, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, Python, XML; it is supported by \\"lexers\\"; more than 200 lexers is created * Code folding * Code tree, i.e. list of functions/classes/etc in the side panel * Multi-carets * Multi-selections * Search/replace with regular expressions * Supports many encodings * Simple auto-completion (fixed list) for some lexers * Extendable via Python pluginshttps://www.ghacks.net/2019/12/21/cudatext-is-an-advanced- text-editor-with-tabs-plugins-image-viewer-and-more/ * Command palette (mimics Sublime Text behaviour) * Configs in JSON format * Based on ATSynEdit engine * Includes hex viewer for files of unlimited size Features for HTML/CSS coding: * Smart auto-completion for HTML, CSS * HTML tags completion with Tab-key (Snippets plugin) * HTML color code underlining * Built-in image viewerhttps://www.ghacks.net/2019/12/21/cudatext-is-an-advanced-text-editor- with-tabs-plugins-image-viewer-and-more/ * Tooltip preview for picture files and HTML entities (plugin) See also * List of text editors * Comparison of text editors * List of HTML editors * Comparison of HTML editors References External links * Official website Category:Free software programmed in Pascal Category:Cross-platform software Category:Cross-platform free software Category:HTML editors Category:Linux text editors Category:MacOS text editors Category:Text editors Category:Free text editors Category:Windows text editors Category:XML editors Category:Unix text editors Category:Pascal (programming language) software ","title":"CudaText"},{"id":"57805692","text":"Patrick Gamble may refer to: * Patrick Gamble (American football) (born 1994), American football defensive end * Patrick K.

Early life Guthrie was born on 7 February 1858, in Kensington, London, the second son of Thomas Anstry Guthrie and his wife Augusta Amherst. His brother was the novelist and journalist Thomas Anstey Guthrie (1856‚Äì1934). His basic education was at King's College School after which he read classics at Magdalen College, University of Oxford. He acquired his master's degree in 1880.Guthrie, Leonard George (1858‚Äì1918). AIM25. Retrieved 1 July 2018. Medical career Guthrie completed his medical studies at St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1886 and subsequently sat the diplomas of both the Royal College of Surgeons and the Society of Apothecaries. He obtained his MD from Oxford in 1893 and became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1900. He went on to become senior physician to the Paddington Green Children's Hospital and was subsequently associated with the Hospital for Epilepsy and Paralysis in Maida Vale. Medical writing Guthrie's major work was Functional Nervous Disorders of Childhood (1907), and he added chapters to Clifford Allbutt's, A System of Medicine (1896‚Äì1899; 1905‚Äì1911), and to the Diseases of Children (1913), edited by Archibald Edward Garrod, Frederick Eustace Batten and James Hugh Thursfield. He contributed articles to the Dictionary of National Biography 1912 supplement on the physicians Charles Edward Beevor and George Alfred Carpenter. He was secretary of the Royal College of Physicians committee that revised the Nomenclature of Diseases (5th edition 1917). He was president of the Harveian Society. In 1907 and 1908 he gave the Fitzpatrick Lecture to the Royal College of Physicians on \\"Contributions to the Study of Precocity in Children\\" and \\"The History of Neurology\\". The lectures were privately printed in 1921 after his death by his nephew, Eric G. Millar. In 1913, Guthrie reviewed the evidence relating to Napoleon Bonaparte's health towards the end of his life in an article for The Lancet. He did not dispute the conventional view that Napoleon died from stomach cancer, and probably had hepatitis too, but argued that his post- mortem remains also showed evidence of hypopituitarism (dystrophia adiposo- genitalis) such as genital atrophy, sexual alopecia, and skeletal and tissue changes that gave a feminine appearance. Death According to a report in The Times, on Christmas Eve 1918, following a consultation in the afternoon, Guthrie had visited a friend in Notting Hill Gate. He left at 5.30 pm to travel home by Tube but, walking too close to the platform edge, he was killed when he was hit by a train as it entered the station.\\" \\"A Kind of Odour of Salem House\\": David Copperfield and Thomas Anstey Guthrie\\" by Peter Merchant in Peter Merchant & Catherine Waters (Eds.)

It connects the two sections of the A37.  History  The Messeschnellweg begins in the north in the district of Gro√ü-Buchholz at junction 5, Hanover-Misburg, A37. It runs in a southerly direction east of the Hanover city, centre through the Eilenriede. Then it passes the eponymous exhibition centre in the district Mittelfeld (de) and ends in Laatzen-Mitte. Here it goes back into the A37 (junction 11 fairgrounds), while at the same time the B6 branches off to the south. The preparations for the construction of the Messeschnellweg already began in 1949. Together with the S√ºdschnellweg, the Westschnellweg and other expressways, it is part of the concept developed by the then city planner Rudolf Hillebrecht to guide long-distance traffic around the city center. The construction of the highway through the middle of the Hanover city forest Eilenriede led to violent protests in the population, which resulted finally in 1956 the city constituted the Eilenriede Advisory Board. The expressway is developed as a four-lane motor road. It is crossing-free since 1998 (completion of the underpass at the Pferdeturmkreuzung ) and partly has a stand track. A traffic control system makes it possible to use this as an additional lane for major events. During the big trade fairs (Hannover Messe, around the turn of the millennium the Cebit, later the Agritechnica) the Messeschnellweg is regulated as a one-way street at peak times (arrival and departure, sometimes only on the busiest days), so that four lanes can be driven in one direction are.

The motorway junction Hannover / Kirchhorst also reaches the A7. In the northern section to the Seelhorst cross the Messeschnellweg is part of the B3, south of it part of the B6. At the Seelhorst cross crosses the S√ºdschnellweg and thus the B65. South of the fairgrounds at the city limits with Laatzen the Messeschnellweg goes back to the A37. At the junction Hannover-Messegel√§nde the B6 branches off to the south, which shortly afterwards crosses the B443. The A37 leads in the interchange Hannover-S√ºd on the A7.

Brissett spent the first 4 years of his life living in the Jane and Finch neighbourhood before moving to Mississauga. After initially attending high school at St. Aloysius Gonzaga Secondary School in Mississauga, Brissett moved away from home & attended high school at Findlay Prep in Henderson, Nevada in the hopes of honing his basketball skills against better competition & to enhance his chances of getting recruited from a major U.S. college. After Findlay Prep, Brissett returned to Canada and spent a year at the Athlete Institute in Mono, Ontario where he excelled as their team captain. College career Brissett committed to Syracuse over USC, Oregon and Memphis. He entered the starting lineup immediately for the Orange, providing an interior presence alongside guards Tyus Battle and Frank Howard. On the year, Brissett averaged 14.9 points and 8.8 rebounds per game in his first college season. Following his freshman season, there was speculation that Brissett could test the waters in the 2018 NBA draft. However, he announced his intention to return to Syracuse for his sophomore season on April 11, 2018. As a sophomore, Brissett averaged 12.4 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. After the season he declared for the NBA draft and forfeited his remaining two years of collegiate eligibility.

Flocs appear as cloudy suspensions of cells floating in water, rather than attached to and growing on a surface like most biofilms. The floc typically is held together by a matrix of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), which may contain variable amounts of polysaccharide, protein, and other biopolymers. The formation and the properties of flocs may affect the performance of industrial water treatment bioreactors such as activated sludge systems where the flocs form a sludge blanket. Floc formation may benefit the constituent microorganisms in a number of ways, including protection from pH stress, resistance to predation, manipulation of microenvironments, and facilitation of mutualistic relationships in mixed microbial communities. In general, the mechanisms by which flocculating microbial aggregates hold together are poorly understood. However, work on the activated sludge bacterium Zoogloea resiniphila has shown that PEP-CTERM proteins must be expressed for flocs to form; in their absence, growth is planktonic, even though exopolysaccharide is produced. Two strains of Zoogloea resiniphila. The tube on the left shows typical floc formations in an otherwise clear culture of a bacterium, Zoogloea resiniphila, isolated from an activated sludge wastewater treatment reactor.

Built in 1756 for a wealthy farmer, it is one of the oldest brick houses in Connecticut, and one of the few of the period with a gambrel roof. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The John Barker House is located in a rural- residential area of far southern Wallingford, on the east side of Clintonville Road south of Molly O'Neill Road. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, covered by a gambrel roof with chimneys at the ends. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance topped by a six-light transom window and framed by molded trim. Ground-floor windows are set in openings that have a slightly arced top, with a soldier brick lintel; second-story windows are butted against the eave. The interior follows a typical period central-hall plan, and retains many original finishes and features. Particularly notable is the brickwork in the fireplaces, and the distinctive moulding and paneling in the principal upstairs chamber. With The house was built in 1756 for John Barker, a prosperous farmer who owned slaves. Barker's grandfather had been a merchant in New Haven who did extensive trade with Barbados. The house is stylistically similar to Connecticut Hall, built in 1752 at Yale, suggesting the builders were familiar with it. Clay for the bricks was probably quarried from deposits on the Connecticut River bottomlands in the North Haven area.

Her directing credits include the Guthrie Theater, Alley Theatre, South Coast Repertory, Oregon Shakespeare Festival, Seattle Repertory Theatre, California Shakespeare Theater, Playmakers Repertory Company, and ACT Theatre. She directs in a variety of genres, including Shakespeare, new plays, and musicals.  Early life  Chiang was born in Taipei, Taiwan, and immigrated to California in the United States when she was three years old. With the encouragement of her parents, she grew up thinking she would be a doctor. She attended the University of California, Berkeley, with an intention to study pre-medicine. It was there that she found connection and community in the theatre department, and eventually graduated with a double major in Biology and Theatre. She then attended the University of Washington School of Drama for a Master of Fine Arts Degree in Theatre Directing.  Career  Chiang is known for her visceral, no-nonsense approach to theatre, with her distinct point of view as an immigrant and Asian American woman. She articulates her interest in using theatre to spark social discourse: \\"What is the thing that we're not talking about? What is the thing that we think we're talking about, but we're not talking about, or no one's ever bothered to think about?\\" In 2010, Chiang co-founded Azeotrope with her graduate school colleague Richard Nguyen Sloniker, to create theatre focusing on stories about invisible and marginalized people. Their most well-known production, Sound by Don Nguyen, was a bilingual show performed in American Sign Language and spoken English, and featured a mixed ensemble of deaf and hearing actors. Chiang learned American Sign Language for this project and co-directed with Seattle-based deaf actor Howie Seago. Some of Chiang's most notable productions include a re-imagined The Winter's Tale at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival set in Dynastic China and New World America featuring an Asian American and multicultural cast, As You Like It at California Shakespeare Theater where the forest of Arden is transformed into an urban jungle, and a modern-day setting of The Crucible at PlayMakers Repertory Company. She has also directed at numerous regional theatres across America, including the Alley Theatre in Houston, Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, and South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, CA.

It is named after the former Karmelitenkirche on the west side of the street.  Location  The Karmeliterstra√üe is located in the district of Altstadt-Lehel, the central district of Munich, and in the northwest of the old town in the Kreuzviertel. It has a length of around 80 meters and starts on the west side of Promenadeplatz. It leads in a south-westerly direction to an intersection, from which the Maxburgstra√üe connects to from Lenbachplatz to the west. From this intersection, L√∂wengrube is the name of the street that branches off to the east in the direction of the Frauenkirche, approximately 200 meters away. In a south-westerly direction, the route of the Karmeliterstra√üe continues through the Ettstra√üe.  Route  On the west side of the Karmeliterstra√üe is the former Karmeliten Church of Saint Nicholas, built from 1657 to 1660. Today, the profaned building is used as an archive of the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising, while a section serves as an event and exhibition area. Adjacent to it are buildings of the Ordinary of the Archdiocese of Munich with a park, which is separated by a wall from the Karmeliterstra√üe. On the east side of the street is a five-story building complex of the Deutsche Bank with two garden courtyards. The building developments previously located there were damaged during the Second World War and later demolished. The Karmelitenstra√üe is a one-way street traveling in a southern direction.  History  The age of today's Karmeliterstra√üe is not known. It has been reported, however, that in the area of today's Promenadeplatz, which lies to the north, there was a municipal Salzstadel (building to the storage and the sales of food salt) during the 15th century which was demolished in 1778. As the oldest names of today's Karmeliterstra√üe is from the period between 1509 and 1565 the name Seem√ºller G√§ssel, which was changed to Neu G√§ssel around the 1600s. At the end of the 18th century, Kaltenecker G√§ssel, as well as Karmelitergasse, aka Karmelitengasse, were to be found. The present-day Karmeliten Church was consecrated in 1660 as a votive and monastery church. From 1806 to 1944, a K√∂nigliches Erziehungsinstitut f√ºr Studierende in M√ºnchen (royal educational institute for students in Munich) was located on Karmeliterstra√üe, which was led by the former Benedictine Benedict of Holland as director from 1811 and was later named Hollandeum after him. The institute was relocated in 1806 from its founding place in the Neuhauser Gasse, into the building of the Karmeliten Church. In 1905, it was officially renamed Albertinum. After the destruction of the building during air raids by the Royal Air Force on 25 April 1944, the institute was once again relocated in 1945. In the Handels- und Gewerbs- Addre√ü-Taschenbuch der K√∂nigl.-Baierischen Haupt- und Residenz-Stadt M√ºnchen (trade and business address-paperback of the king Baierischen main and residence city Munich) from 1818, the Karmeliterstra√üe houses numbers 1441 to 1444 are listed. In addition, the Karmeliter-Platze with the house numbers 1445 and 1446 were also listed. For the new house numbering (published in 1833), the house number 1441 became Karmelitergasse 3, the number 1442 became number 4, number 1443 became number 1 (educational institute), and the number 1444 became number 2 (study church). The house numbers 1445 and 1446 from Karmeliterplatze became the Pfandhausgasse, today's Pacellistra√üe.  Promenadeplatz, corner of Karmeliterstra√üe  Opposite the Karmeliter Church, the institute building, stood a brewery since 1482, which belonged to the Weihenstephan Abbey (1603-1629) in the 17th century, which was then named after the next owner, Pollinger¬¥sche Brauerei (Pollinger brewery) (1629-1667), which was characterized along with the Salzst√§deln at Kalteneckh, aka Kalten√∂gg, in 1662/63. In the first half of the 19th century in the then still called Karmelitergasse, the brewery was called Kaltenecker, Kalten-Ecker or Kaltenegger Br√§uhaus and had the house number 15. According to a sale notice of 1811, the Br√§uhaus also was owner to a summer cellar on the Gasteige. The Handels- und Gewerbs-Addre√ü-Taschenbuch of the Royal Baierisches Haupt- and Residenz-Stadt M√ºnchen of 1818 listed the Kaltenecker-Brauhaus as part of Promenadeplatz after it was used as a parade ground after the demolition of the Salzstadel and was transformed into a green garden space starting in 1804 and was renamed Promenadeplatz. In 1826, the brewery belonging to the citizen and brewer Johann Gallinger (‚Ä† 1828) was abandoned and in 1848, the brewery name was transferred to the Spatenbrauerei. Due to its proximity to the Karmeliter monastery, the brewery is sometimes referred to as the Karmelitenbrauerei. Even though the Karmeliter monastery actually had its own brewery on Karmelitergasse but it was demolished in the wake of the secularization and in its place the institute buildings of the royal educational institute were erected. The brewery, with the house number 1440 is now officially listed as Promenadeplatz 15 since 1833, but was also still seen as Karmelitergasse 15, which later referred to the side entrance on Karmelitergasse, aka Karmeliterstra√üe. Later, the brewery received the general assignment of Promenadeplatz 21, corner of Karmeliterstra√üe. As early as 1802, the former Kaltenecker brewery in Karmelitergasse was home to a boutique owned by Dutch textile merchant Gerhard Graeve von Neuenrade, and then the business premises of the Jewish merchant, wholesaler and banker Moritz Guggenheimer (1824-1902). His father Bernhard S. Guggenheimer (1791-1865) moved from Harburg in the Donau-Ries to Munich in 1825 as a small but quite wealthy textile merchant (linen, silk) and had received a wholesale concession from the Munich city council. Together with his sons Moritz, Eduard, Josef and Sigmund, he expanded the wholesale business on Promenadeplatz 21, three of the sons were active as bankers and led the bank Guggenheimer & Co. After Moritz Guggenheimer was one of the co-founders of the Bayerische Vereinsbank in 1869, the bank Guggenheimer was taken over in 1892, from then on until his death, Moritz Guggenheimer belonged on the Supervisory Board of Vereinsbank. In 1874 the, previously settled on Promenadeplatz 13 and since 1861 existing, cloth wholesale from Meyer Holzinger and Julius Heymann was relocated to Promenadeplatz 21. Later, the Jewish textile retailer, Sally Eichengr√ºn, opened his popular fabric shop there which, like the brewery, once appears as listed to be \\"in Karmelitergasse\\", sometimes as \\"on Promenadeplatz\\" aka \\"on Ritter-von-Epp-Platz\\". Eichengr√ºn also owned the property, which today corresponds to the Karmeliterstra√üe 2a. In 1935, the company was denounced for concealing the Jewish character of their company. Their winter closing sale in 1936 ended in a report being made by the Munich police department. In 1938, Eichengr√ºn sold the company to Herbert G. Stiehler and the Frey-Stalf family. In 1939, he then emigrated to Switzerland. In 1986, the former houses Promenadeplatz 15 (Gunetzrhainerhaus), 19 (Karmeliterb√§cker) and 21 were combined to form the current number 15, to which the current building complex belongs to the Deutsche Bank, which also runs along the eastern side of Karmeliterstra√üe.

Background Before the formation of a coalition government in March 2018, immigration policy had become an issue that prevented Angela Merkel obtaining a workable majority, with the Free Democratic Party declining to join a coalition and all potential coalition partners calling for stricter migration controls. The coalition government agreement, made between Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Social Democratic Party (SPD), was not ratified by SPD members until 3 March 2018, more than five months after the September 2017 German Federal elections. The coalition agreement indicates that the parties intended to modify policies in relation to refugees and family reunification. \\"The previous government (also a CDU/CSU/SPD grand coalition) had suspended the right of refugees with a 'limited protection status' to bring their families over. The new coalition deal says this will be limited to 1,000 people per month. On top of that, the number of asylum-seekers taken in altogether is to be capped at between 180,000 and 220,000 per year.\\" Incidents June 2018 In June 2018, the coalition government, especially the CDU/CSU sister parties, quarreled over the specifics of asylum policies.

Characterization In the United States, the regulation of the pharmacist-to-pharmacy technician ratio is regulated at the individual state level. Some states vary the ratio by institutional (e.g. hospital) pharmacy practice versus retail (i.e. community) pharmacy practice, while others do not regulate pharmacist-to-pharmacy technician ratios at all.

Globally, one survey found that pharmacists are the most frequent source of supervision for pharmacy technicians. Rationale and criticism Pharmacist-to-pharmacy technician ratios are an attempt to find a balance between providing assistance to the practicing pharmacist in operating the pharmacy while maintaining adequate supervision of their pharmacy technicians. While staffing issues are reported by pharmacy technicians to increase the risk for medication-related medical errors, misconduct by an unsupervised pharmacy technician can result in significant patient harm. Critics of low pharmacist-to-pharmacy technician ratios have complained that the lack of pharmacy technicians staffing forces pharmacists to devote more time to non-clinical, dispensing-related tasks, as opposed to performing direct patient care services and over-the-counter counseling. History While pharmacist-to-pharmacy technician ratio were initially low with pharmacy technicians engaged in retail tasks (acting as cashiers), the ratios have increased over time as pharmacy technicians have taken on new duties, such as reconstituting medications and intermediating between the pharmacy and insurance companies.

Samuel Thomas Greene (June 11, 1843 ‚Äì February 17, 1890) was a Deaf American educator and Ontario's first Deaf teacher in 1870 at the Ontario Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, which later changed to Sir James Whitney School of the Deaf in Belleville, Ontario, Canada. He was born in 1843 in Portland, Maine and attended to America's first Deaf school in Hartford, Connecticut.  Biography  Samuel Thomas Green was born on June 11, 1843 in Portland, Maine to hearing parents, Jacob and Sarah Greene. He had four other siblings, one of whom was also Deaf. Greene's parents, Jacob and Sarah, were huge believers of education and religion. Before starting the formal education, Greene began reading and writing at an early age and he also managed to acquire some of American Sign Language (ASL) from her Deaf sister, Sarah Abbott Greene, who attended to the American Asylum for the Education and Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb, currently known as the American School of the Deaf, during that time. Greene eventually began his formal education at the American School of the Deaf on September 18, 1855 and he was taught by one of the most prominent teacher, Laurent Clerc, a French co-founder of the first deaf school in United States in 1817, who dedicated his time in the Deaf Education field for more than fifty years. After his graduation in 1866, Greene enrolled into National Deaf-Mute College (now Gallaudet University) on September 12, 1866 to pursue a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree. He graduated from Gallaudet University on June 30, 1870 with four other graduates and they were the second congregation to graduate from the university. Greene delivered an oration during his graduation day \\"The Law of Limitation in National Life\\". After the graduation, Greene worked at American School of the Deaf as an assistant teacher before he began his journey to Belleville, Ontario to be a teacher at newly opened Sir James Whitney School of the Deaf (formerly Ontario Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb) on October 20, 1870. He is considered Ontario's first Deaf teacher. Greene married to Caroline Campbell Howard on April 9, 1871. Caroline was a grand-daughter of the pioneer Belleville settler, Elijah Wallbridge who settled at Meyer's Creek in 1800, which later became the City of Belleville. The couple has five children, four girls and one boy, and all of them were hearing. Greene and his family embraced bilingualism and biculturalism in their household.  Deaf Education  The Deaf Education in North America in the 1800s was truly sparse and limited. Luckily, Greene was taught by several notable Deaf educators when he received his formal education at the American Asylum for the Education and Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb from 1855 to 1866. Because of the formal education, Greene was able to attend to the National Deaf-Mute College (Gallaudet University) and receive his college degree. Greene officially began his career as the first Deaf educator at the Ontario Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb (Sir James Whitney School of the Deaf) on October 20, 1870. He was considered a first-rate teacher and he has his own memoir, The Proper Mode of Teaching New Pupils, where he lists his teaching methods for Deaf children based on his thirteen years of teaching experience. Throughout the memoir, it shows that Greene embraces the bilingual education philosophy and a big believer of connecting with his students to build trust first before he begins his teaching. The provincial Government wrote a report on Greene's performance in 1877 and an excerpt from the report states that Greene recognizes that Deaf students need a good foundation to build their education. He was a strong believer of bilingual education and using American Sign Language with his students.  Death  Samuel Thomas Greene's burial monument in Belleville Cemetery. The fingerspelling of his surname, Greene, on the base of his burial monument. Samuel Thomas Greene died on February 17, 1890 at the age of 46 at his family home in Belleville, Ontario after an ice yachting accident on the Bay of Quinte. The ice yachting was an incredibly popular activity among people of all ages in Belleville during that time. Greene was an avid ice-boating yachtsman and he regularly took his pupils, staff members and friends on many sails on the Bay of Quinte. Greene and his friends went on a leisure ice yacht trip on the Bay of Quinte on February 3rd, 1890. Due to the rapid speed and miscommunication, Greene was thrown out from the boat and flew ten feet through the air and hit his head on the ice with a strong force. In the following evening, he fell into unconsciousness and died fourteen days later on February 17, 1890. The news of his death has devastated many people in Belleville, especially the staff members and pupils at the Ontario Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb. The Ontario Institution held the funeral service for him two days later on February 19, 1890 and everyone at the school wore badges to pay their respect for the memory of him. He was buried in Belleville Cemetery. The tombstone was erected in the fall of 1880 and his burial tombstone is widely known among the Deaf and hard of hearing community. Located in the Section P of the Belleville Cemetery, his tombstone has an engraving of his last name \\"Greene\\" in manual alphabet of American Sign Language.  Legacy  Samuel Thomas Greene was Ontario's first Deaf teacher and he was described as \\"a born teacher\\". Greene was the trailblazer in Deaf Education in Ontario and he is known for his reputation through his Deaf education and leadership efforts in the deaf community. He was one of the founding fathers of the Ontario Deaf-Mute Association in 1886. The name was later changed to Ontario Association of the Deaf (OAD) in 1910. The Ontario Association of the Deaf, along with Greene's friend and artist Ambrose W. Mason, unveiled and donated a forty-four inches by fifty-four inches portrait of Greene to Sir James Whitney School of the Deaf in July 1924 where the portrait currently hangs at the cafeteria building. A street in the west end of Belleville was named after Greene in his honor. The Ontario Heritage Foundation unveiled a commemorate plaque to honor Greene's achievements during the 125th anniversary celebration of Sir James Whitney School of the Deaf on July 1st, 1995. Greene was mentioned in the City of Belleville's Heritage walking guide in recognition of his work in Deaf Education.

For several years, she received private tutoring in Europe for music, languages, and drawing. She had a notable career in concert and opera as a prima donna contralto. Early years and education Agnes Huntington was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in ca. 1864. She was the daughter of Charles E. and Fannie E. (Munsell) Huntington and was raised by them in New York City. She was educated at Mrs. Sylvanus Reed's School for Girls in New York City. In 1880, her family decided that she should follow a career of her own choosing. She hesitated to choose between music and art, for both were attractive to her, and she finally decided to become an operatic singer. Her rich contralto voice was inherited from her mother. Huntington went to Dresden in 1880, where she studied for four years with Giovanni Battista Lamperti. Said Huntington:‚Äî Career Huntington made her first public appearance in concert in Dresden, in January, 1884, and a few weeks later, sang at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig with the regular orchestra under direction of Carl Reinecke. Later appearances were in Stuttgart with Joseph Joachim (Hungarian violinist), then with Pablo de Sarasate (Spanish violinist), and Klintworth and his orchestra at the Sing- Akademie zu Berlin. She next appeared in a concert given by Alexandre Guilmant and √âdouard Colonne and his Concerts Colonne orchestra at the Trocad√©ro in Paris. Later, she appeared in concerts in London in association with great musicians and conductors, including Sir Julius Benedict, Wilhelm Ganz, Alberto Randegger, Sir George Grove and others, which brought her much social attention. At this time, she received from the then Princess of Wales (later, the Dowager Queen Alexandra) a beautiful brooch of precious stones. She also sang in Paris. Agnes Huntington (1888) In 1885, she made her American debut with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, under the direction of Theodore Thomas, who engaged her for the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra and other concerts, of which he was the conductor. She also sang with the Boston Symphony Orchestra with William Goricke, the Oratorio Society of New York with Walter Damrosch, and in many of the most important festivals under the greatest conductors in the U.S. and Canada. After making a tour of the principal cities, she joined the Boston Ideal Opera Company, and with that company, she sang successfully for several seasons. Next, she sang with the Bostonians, in which she visited the principal cities of the United States and Canada, appearing in the leading roles of the standard operas, for which her commanding presence and contralto voice eminently fitted her. With the Bostonians, she gained experience in acting, singing in Martha, Giralda, Fra Diavolo, Les Mousquetaires de la reine, The Bohemian Girl, Mignon, and others. Agnes Huntington (1890) In 1889 she went to London, under the management of the Carl Rosa Opera Company, having signed for a season of concert, oratorio, and light opera. There, she created the title role in Paul Jones by Robert Planquette, in which she made a great hit. Originally put on for a short run, Paul Jones remained on the boards during 346 nights in the Prince of Wales Theatre, and at every performance the house was crowded. A dispute with her managers led her to leave the company, and she returned to the U.S. When Huntington's year in London was finished, she determined to become a star and produce her own operas. Under the management of Marcus Mayer she began her career as a star in Paul Jones in New York, and she could have selected no better production. She asserted that her short experience convinced her that the public had grown tired of coarse fun and vulgarity and would patronize op√©ra comique that was clean and pure, with a story to tell, a consistent plot to unfold, and ennobled with good music and well-concerted orchestration, and that her ventures were made upon this assumption. The ambition of Huntington as a caterer of operatic productions for the entertainment of the public led her to constant novelty and progressiveness, and as a result, she presented Planquette's work, Captain Therese. As Huntington personally superintended all of her own productions in every detail, the amount of labor which devolves upon her may be imagined, and her own description of her work in this respect was thus:‚Äî In all her travels, Huntington was accompanied by her mother, who proved to be her best friend and adviser, and between the two there existed the utmost devotion. With her company, Huntington is deservedly popular. If she is a strict disciplinarian, she is also generous, and the slightest complaint of any wrong or oversight finds her always a willing listener and quick to rectify any error. On the occasion of the disbandment of her company in 1891, a list was presented to her of the fines inflicted upon several of the members during its continuance for tardiness and oversights. In some cases, these amounted to considerable sums. She generously remitted every fine, paid her company in full, and re-engaged its best members on the spot. Not the least drag upon her time was correspondence involved in answers to the many letters she received from girls about how to adopt the stage, asking her advice regarding the qualifications necessary and the best means of procuring engagements. These letters she felt it a duty to answer. She encouraged none with false hopes, but represented the trials and labors of stage life fully and clearly, so that the frivolous were deterred, while the truly ambitious were encouraged. Most careful and painstaking in every effort, she abhorred nothing so much as a sham, and would not tolerate meretricious advertising or any tricks of the trade, so often resorted to by actors for the sake of notoriety. She trusted entirely to the excellence of her productions, upon which she spared no expense in staging, and in which her entire fortune was invested, and to her own merit, for recognition and patronage. She had in her efforts shown English op√©ra comique to be a high grade of entertaining amusement. Huntington was tall, fair and of commanding presence. Her voice was a pure, clear, strong and thoroughly cultivated contralto. In London, her social successes were as great as her professional ones. Among her intimate friends, there were the Baroness Burdett-Coutts, the Duchess of Westminster, and other prominent personages. She served as director of the New York Symphony Society, and the Institute of Musical Arts and others. Personal life On November 15, 1892, in Saint Thomas Church, Manhattan, she married attorney Paul Drennan Cravath, with whom she had one daughter, Vera Agnes Huntington Cravath (b. 1895). Following marriage, she became a director of several charities, and contributed to many charitable societies. She was an animal activist, and a member of the Colony Club. Huntington was Episcopalian, and opposed women's suffrage. She resided at 105 E. Thirty-ninth Street, in New York City, with a country estate in Locust Valley, Long Island, New York. Huntington died in Manhattan, on March 10, 1953, and was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery, The Bronx.\\"Agnes B. Huntington Cravath\\", Find A Grave. Retrieved July 12, 2020.

She is an Associate Research Scientist at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Columbia Engineering's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics, and writes regularly for Scientific American in her column \\"Hot Planet.\\"  Education and early career  Marvel attended the University of California at Berkeley, where she received her Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and astronomy in 2003. She received her PhD in 2008 in theoretical physics from University of Cambridge as a Gates Scholar and member of Trinity College. Following her PhD, she shifted her focus to climate science and energy as a Postdoctoral Science Fellow at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University and at the Carnegie Institution for Science in the Department of Global Ecology. She continued that trajectory as a postdoctoral fellow at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory before joining the research faculty at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Columbia University.  Research  Marvel's current research centers on climate modeling to better predict how much the Earth's temperature will rise in the future. This work led Marvel to investigate the effects of cloud cover on modeling rising temperatures, which has proved an important variable in climate models. Clouds can play a double-edged role in mitigating or amplifying the rate of global warming. On one hand, clouds reflect solar energy back into space, serving to cool the planet; on the other, clouds can trap the planet's heat and radiate back onto Earth's surface. While computer models have difficulty simulating the changing patterns of cloud cover, improved satellite data can begin to fill in the gaps. Marvel has also documented shifting patterns of soil moisture from samples taken around the world, combining them with computer models and archives of tree rings, to model the effects of greenhouse gas production on patterns of global drought. In this study, which was published in the journal Nature in May 2019, Marvel and her colleagues were able to distinguish the contribution of humans from the effects of natural variation of weather and climate. They found three distinct phases of drought in the data: a clear human fingerprint on levels of drought in the first half of the 20th century, followed by a decrease in drought from 1950 to 1975, followed by a final rise in levels of drought in the 1980s and beyond. The mid-century decrease in drought correlated with the rise in aerosol emissions, which contribute to rising levels of smog that may have reflected and blocked sunlight from reaching the Earth, altering patterns of warming. The subsequent rise of drought correlated with the decrease in global air pollution, which occurred in the 1970s and 1980s due to the passage of legislation like the United States Clean Air Act, suggesting that aerosol pollution may have had a moderating effect on drought. Marvel has also studied practical limitations in renewable energy as a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Carnegie Institution for Science. At the 2017 TED conference, following computer theorist Danny Hillis's talk proposing geoengineering strategies to mitigate global warming, Marvel was brought on stage to share why she believes geoengineering may cause more harm than good in the long run.  Public engagement  Marvel is a science communicator whose efforts center on communicating about the impacts of climate change. She has been a guest on popular science shows like StarTalk and BRIC Arts Media TV, speaking about her expertise in climate change and the need to act on climate. She has also spoken about her path to becoming a scientist for the science-inspired storytelling series, The Story Collider. Marvel has also appeared on the TED Main Stage, giving a talk at the 2017 TED conference about the double-edged effect clouds can have on global warming. Marvel's writing has been featured in On Being and Nautilus. She is a regular contributor to Scientific American with her column \\"Hot Planet\\". The column launched in June 2018 and focuses on climate change, covering the science behind global warming, policies, and human efforts in advocacy.

Common names include the Chilean sheepshead wrasse, the goldspot sheepshead or the Galapagos sheepshead wrasse. Description This is a large wrasse, with a maximum length of . The dorsal fin has twelve spines and ten soft rays while the anal fin has three spines and twelve soft rays. Distribution and habitat S. darwini is native to the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. Its range includes the Gal√°pagos Islands and on the coast of South America, extends from Ecuador southward through Peru to northern Chile. It is normally found among seaweed, including deep-water kelp forests, and its depth range is from . Ecology The strong sharp teeth provide evidence of its diet as a benthic predator, and this is confirmed by the stomach contents which include fragments of shells and other coarse calcareous debris as well as detritus. Other large carnivorous fish dwelling in the kelp forest include the Peruvian morwong (Cheilodactylus variegatus), the Chilean sandperch Pinguipes chilensis, the sea chub Graus nigra, and the Cape redfish (Sebastes capensis). These fish are preyed on by the marine otter (Lontra felina) and the South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens). Status S. darwini is caught for food throughout its range and is fished commercially in the Gal√°pagos Islands. It is a large, and probably a slow-growing, fish which makes it vulnerable to over exploitation. There was a decline of 80% in the Galapagos populations during the 1997‚Äì1998 El Ni√±o event, but the fish stock recovered in the following year, making it likely that the fish had moved to deeper water during the adverse conditions. The International Union for Conservation of Nature considers that there is not enough evidence to assess the conservation status of this fish and has rated it as \\"data deficient\\".

The bulletins were the first competition to Het Journaal, the news programmes broadcast by the VRT. History VTM Nieuws was first broadcast on 1 February 1989, the same night that VTM itself launched. As VTM's popularity grew, so did that of its news bulletins, with VTM Nieuws becoming a formidable competitor to Het Journaal throughout the 1990s. In its early years, VTM Nieuws was known for its relative innovations: its main bulletin, broadcast at 7pm, was presented by two newscasters, which was hitherto unheard of within Flanders; it was also the first Flemish news programme to broadcast a bulletin in the afternoon, and to have its newscasters present from within the newsroom. At the turn of the century, however, viewing figures began to decline, due to modernisation efforts by the VRT. In 2004, VTM Nieuws was renamed to Het Nieuws, as part of a major rebranding exercise: a new studio was built, featuring a large videowall; all bulletins were now presented by one newscaster, and several new on-screen faces were introduced. This led to a rise in ratings, although the effect wore off after a few years. In 2013, Het Nieuws was renamed back to VTM Nieuws, bringing with it a new logo and studio; a new editorial direction was also introduced, with more attention being paid to political, international and cultural news. Following this rebrand, the popularity of the broadcasts once again increased. On 3 February 2020, production of VTM Nieuws moved from its former base in Vilvoorde to a new building in Antwerp, shared with journalists from Het Laatste Nieuws.

The route, when completed, will run between the Port Louis District and Plaines Wilhems District. History Mauritius had been without a railway system following the closure of Mauritius Government Railways in the 1960s. Due to increased car usage and chronic road congestion, plans for a light railway system have been proposed over many years. On 31 July 2017 in Ebene the Government of Mauritius signed a contract for the creation of a light rail transit system. The project is led by the Indian company Larsen & Toubro, after winning a tender from the Government of Mauritius for ‚Ç® 1,880 crore (18.8 billion), of which ‚Ç® 990 crore (9.9 billion) is being provided by a grant from the Government of India. The first phase of the project was inaugurated on 2nd of October 2019 by the Prime Minister of Mauritius, Pravind Jugnauth and the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi. On 17 December 2019 Metro Express Ltd, the company running the system, announced that operations will start on 22 December 2019 at 11 am. For the initial period of 15 days the passengers were carried free of charge on presentation of a free ticket, valid in a given direction and for a given period of time. The promotional period ended on 10 January 2020. Construction Phase 1 links Port Louis to Rose Hill. It was to be completed in September 2019 but the regular revenue service did not start until 10 January 2020. Phase 2 will extend the line from Rose Hill to Curepipe in September 2021. Some old railway tracks have been uncovered during construction in Rose Hill and may be used as exhibits for a Railway Museum. Fares single adult fare is ‚Ç®30 or ‚Ç®20 if the trip does not involve travelling between Coromandel and Barkly. Children below the age of 3 and eligible senior citizens and disabled people are entitled to free fares. Rolling stock On 26 July 2017, CAF announced that they had won a tender to provide 18 Urbos 100-3 worth over ‚Ç¨100 million. The deal also includes providing the signalling system, automatic vehicle location system (AVLS), transit signal priority system (TSPS), depot equipment and a driving simulator. Opposition The Metro Express has been criticised by many, especially as some people had to be expropriated because their land was on the route of the future line. Houses had to be destroyed. Trade unionists have also expressed their concern about the risk of job losses in the transport sector as the LRT system is implemented on one of the busiest routes of the island.

Scoring gauges are tools used in shooting sports to determine the scoring value of a bullet hole on a shooting target. There are mainly two types of scoring gauges used for paper and cardboard targets, either the \\"cone shaped\\" tool or a transparent overlay. The increased use of electronic targets have led to manual scoring gauges being less used. In modern olympic precision shooting competitions there is usually no manual evaluation of scoring hits any more. However, many of the same principles for manual scoring gauges discussed in this article also applies for programmed scoring gauges used in electronic targets.  Types of scoring gauges   Manual cone gauges  Some competition rules state that a cone tool only can be used to gauge a bullet hole once,Sportordnung DSB (Stand: 1. Januar 2011): Auswertung Regelnummer: 0.11.1.3 since the tool widens the hole.  Manual overlays  Overlay gauges can be used several times without affecting the target, making it possible for several referees to evaluate a scoring in case of doubt. Scoring overlays are amongst others used in practical shooting within the International Practical Shooting Confederation.  Automatic electronic target gauging  Electronic targets do not need physical inspection, but rather relies on a programmed gauging of the bullet hole.  Caliber independent gauging  Scoring gauges can either have a fixed gauging diameter used for all bullet diameters, or have the gauging diameter vary depending on the caliber used. Caliber independent gauging is solely used on both paper and electronic targets in olympic precision events. Some sports use caliber dependent gauging for paper targets. * Caliber dependent gauging gives a slight scoring advantage for calibers with larger bullet diameters, since the larger diameter of the bullet more easily can break scoring rings. * Caliber independent gauging means that bullets with different diameters will be compared based on the center of their bullet holes, giving a more fair comparison of marksmanship across two cartridges where the bullet diameter is the only difference. With caliber independent gauging, two different caliber shot holes, with same distance measured from the center of their bullet holes to the center of the target, will always score the same value. To give an example of the difference, consider using a cone shape gauge to score a .22 Long Rifle bullet hole (with the .22 LR having a bullet diameter between 5.7 to 5.73 mm), the tip of the scoring gauge might have a diameter of 5 mm and a gauge base measuring 5.6 mm in diameter. On the contrary, a scoring gauge for the 9√ó19mm Parabellum (9.01 mm bullet diameter) might have a spindle diameter of 9.65 mm, and is therefore slightly larger than the bullet diameter, which is also the case for most scoring gauges. Therefore, an edge hit with the .32 S&W; Long (7.9 mm bullet diameter) gauged with a 9.1 mm bullet diameter scoring gauge would be gauged as almost one millimeter over the actual bullet hole,Sportordnung DSB (Stand: 1. Januar 2011): Schusslochpr√ºfer Regelnummer: 0.11.1.8 and possibly breaking a scoring ring the else wouldn't be broken.  Method  The outcome of a score gauging is binary; either the bullet hole is assigned a scoring value or not. A bullet hole which doesn't touch a scoring edge does not need to be gauged, but bullet holes which touches a scoring edge often needs to be gauged, and can be mathematically classified into five scenarios: * Being tangent to the scoring edge from the outside. * Breaking a scoring edge from the outside. * Breaking a scoring edge from both the outside and inside. * Breaking a scoring edge from the inside. * Being tangent to the scoring edge from the inside. Whether the bullet holes in these scenarios are scored as the higher or lower value depends, according to the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP), on whether the target is scored \\"inward\\" or \\"outward\\".  Inward scoring  Scoring with gauges outward is done as follows in CMP: * Higher value: ** Outside edge is tangent with outside of the scoring ring. ** Outside edge of gauge inside of scoring ring. ** Outside edge of gauge outside of scoring ring. * Lower value: ** Outside edge of gauge lies inside of outside edge of scoring ring.  Outward scoring  Scoring with gauges inward is done as follows in CMP: * Higher value: ** Inside edge of gauge touches or is tangent with outside edge of scoring ring. ** Inside edge of gauge breaks outside edge of scoring ring. * Lower value: ** Inside edge of gauge does not touch outside edge of scoring ring.

Laufer is best known for her paintings of women, as well as her paintings in abstract expressionist, geometric abstraction, and pop art styles. In addition, she was an early participant in the feminist art movement starting in the 1960s. She also worked as a calligrapher, illustrator, graphic designer and teacher. Early life and education Miriam Laufer was born in Lodz, Poland on November 15, 1918 to Sara Perl Ickowitz and Heinrich Ickowitz. Three years later her family moved to Berlin, Germany, and shortly after her father abandoned the family. Her mother placed Miriam and her brother into a culturally and academically progressive children's home in Berlin called Ahava. While living at Ahava Laufer became involved in stage set design and was very active in their art studio. In 1934 Youth Aliyah helped the Jewish children's home, including Miriam, emigrated to Haifa, then part of Palestine. While in Haifa, Laufer studied painting with Zvi Mairovich as well as graphic design with Hermann Struck. She entered the Bezalel Art School in Jerusalem in 1938 on a scholarship. There she studied graphics with Joseph Budko and painting with Mordecai Ardon, who had studied at the Bauhaus. In 1941, after graduating from Bezalel, Laufer married Sigmund Laufer, an artist she met while studying at Bezalel. Miriam and Sigmund Laufer continued to work as artists after emigrating to New York City in 1947. The couple had two daughters, Susan Bee (b.1952) and Abigail Laufer (b.1956). Career In the mid 1940s Laufer worked as a professional designer in Tel Aviv, Israel. She created signs for the British Army in Hebrew, Polish, Arabic, Greek, Urdu, French, and English using her graphic expertise. After her move to America, Laufer used her artistic training to work in various commercial art field including illustration, graphic design, and calligraphy. From 1961-1963 she worked as a teaching assistant for the artists Samuel Adler and Leo Manso in the New York University art department. Exhibitions Between 1959-2016 there have been thirteen solo shows of Laufer's paintings, prints, and drawings. Most of these shows were at the Phoenix Gallery in New York where Laufer exhibited over a period of twenty years, and where she was included in many group shows starting in 1951. The 2006 the exhibition Seeing Double included Laufer's paintings, along with those of her daughter Susan Bee, and was held at A.I.R. Gallery in New York. The Provincetown Art Association and Museum held a solo retrospective exhibition, Views and Vignettes, the Works of Miriam Laufer, in 2016. Laufer spent many summers with her family in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where she was a regular exhibiter. \\"The vivid, colorful, painterly work she produced until her death in 1980, resonate with the spirit of contemporary women's work. The unabashed and even flamboyant nudes, self-portraits, and luscious landscapes, as well as the critically engaged collage and pop works, with their stenciled statements, seem fresh and relevant today. Her engagement with autobiographical subject matter and frank depiction of the female body are unusual for a woman painter of her generation.\\" ‚ÄìJohanna Drucker, curator of Views and Vignettes, the works of Miriam Laufer. Laufer's artwork has received critical recognition in The New York Times, Art News, Art in America, Art Digest, The Forward, The Brooklyn Rail, and other publications. Her paintings are in many private collections and are in the collection of the Wadsworth Atheneum, in Hartford, Connecticut and the Provincetown Art Association and Museum. Later life and education In the late 1960s, Laufer became involved with the women's movement and was an early supporter of the feminist art movement. At age 52, she returned to school at Brooklyn College and received a B. A., magna cum laude, in 1973. She died of a stroke on October 6, 1980 in New York City.

He was a student of Edouard Du Puy and took over many of his roles at the Royal Opera when Du Puy died in 1822 and enjoyed great popularity in the 1820s and -30s, during which he was regarded as one of the greater singers of the opera. His voice was described as a flexible and soft tenor and he was given much attention because of his \\"romantic enchantment of his voice and personality\\". However, he suffered from a frail health and chest pains, which damaged his voice during the 1830s and cause his early death.  References  * Hedberg, Frans (1885).

The party resulted from a split in the Queensland Labor Party and spent most of its existence in government, before merging with the conservative faction of Robert Philp in October 1908, to form the Liberal Party. History In 1903, Queensland's long-running Continuous Ministry fell and was replaced by a coalition of liberals and Labor. The government was headed by Arthur Morgan and included two Labor members, though not the party leaders. In 1906, Morgan was succeeded as Premier by William Kidston, one of the Labor members of the government. However, Kidston grew increasingly dissatisfied with the official direction of the Labor Party as set by the 1905 party convention on the issues of collective ownership and Crown land sales, which he felt to be impractical and electorally unrealistic. The 1906 federal election saw Labor do badly in Queensland at the hands of the Anti-Socialist Party, confirming Kidston's views as conflict grew between pursuing an efficient reformist government and the pursuit of Labor's stated interests and ideology. Kidston demanded greater loyalty to himself but the 1907 party convention reaffirmed the socialist objective, resulting in a split. All but fourteen members of the Labor parliamentary party rallied to Kidston's banner, and in the 1907 state election, the Kidstonites won twenty-four seats. Because neither they nor Labor nor Robert Philp's Conservative group had a majority, a three-party system operated in the state over the next two years, with no party able to govern alone. Kidston secured some support from Labor on common issues, but the conservative Queensland Legislative Council obstructed much legislation. Kidston tried to appoint more supportive members to the council but the Governor of Queensland Lord Chelmsford refused, leading to Kidston's resignation. Philp formed a government which was promptly denied supply by parliament, and was forced to a new election in February 1908 at which the balance in the parliament was barely altered. Kidston resumed office and, with the support of Labor, passed reforms including the Parliamentary Bills Referendum Act, which allowed for bills blocked repeatedly in the Council to be submitted to a referendum. Other legislation passed involved pensions, wages boards and electoral reform, but the alliance with Labor came to an end, and later bills, such as to allow private railway construction, were passed with the support of Philp's Conservatives. Increasingly, the Kidstonites and the Conservatives were drawn together and, in October 1908, they merged, reviving the name Liberal Party. Not all Kidstonite parliamentarians accepted the merger, and a group called the \\"Independent Opposition\\" emerged, headed by former Attorney General James Blair, which included former Labor leaders Peter Airey and George Kerr.

Manufactured by the Zenith Radio Corporation, it went on sale in 1938. The product was developed by Zenith executive Eugene F. McDonald, and designed by Japanese-American sculptor and product designer Isamu Noguchi. Although the product was manufactured for only a few years, it has been acclaimed for its design. It is still in demand and is in many museum collections.  Design, function and marketing  The product commonly called the Radio Nurse consisted of two components, the Radio Nurse Receiver and the Guardian Ear Transmitter. Noguchi designed the Radio Nurse Receiver, which was made from a dark colored Bakelite in a streamlined modernist form. The Guardian Ear Transmitter was a more utilitarian design, and was made from enameled metal. The Radio Nurse was Noguchi's first major design commission and he called it \\"my only strictly industrial design\\" The product encountered technical problems because it shared a radio frequency with other new consumer technologies including car radios and garage door openers.\\" Although the Radio Nurse has commonly been described as a baby monitor, an early Zenith advertisement mentioned invalids as well as infants, and featured an illustration of an elderly woman as well as a baby. This ad appeared in Hygeia, a popular magazine published by the American Medical Association.  Critical reception  In 1938, the Radio Nurse was included in an exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art. In its review of the show, Time said, \\"Most exotic: Isamu Noguchi's Radio Nurse, a grilled bakelite face‚Äîprettier as a radio than as a nurse.\\" Design historians Charlotte and Peter Fiell wrote that the Radio Nurse \\"displayed a remarkably refined synthesis of form and function\\". The Encyclopedia of Interior Design said that the Radio Nurse has a \\"strangely comforting watchful quality\\". Smithsonian magazine wrote that \\"It sits like a dark, faceless plastic mask, more like a prototype for a Star Wars film.\\" On Antiques Roadshow, appraiser Gary Piattoni said, \\"What's significant about this piece is the design. It's an excellent example of modern design by a very famous Japanese-American designer called Isamu Noguchi.\\" Reflecting on the attention he received, Noguchi wrote in his autobiography, \\"By a curious switch, I thought of commercial art as less contaminated than one that appealed to vanity.\\"  Museum collections  The Radio Nurse is included in the collections of many American museums, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Henry Ford Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, the Noguchi Museum, the Cooper Hewitt, the Oakland Museum of California, the Yale University Art Gallery, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. It is also part of the collections of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the M+ museum under construction in Hong Kong.

Early life Filippo was the son of Anton Francesco Farsetti and his wife Marina Foscari. The Foscari were an ancient Venetian patrician family, which reached its peak in the 14th‚Äì15th centuries with the dogeship of Francesco Foscari (1423-1457). The Farsetti, on the other hand, originally came from Tuscany, though they had divided into numerous branches that established themselves throughout Northern Italy. Filippo's branch had become part of the patrician class of Venice as late in 1664, by payment of a hundred thousand ducats. Though relatively recent arrivals, therefore, they were very rich, and this meant for Filippo a comfortable and carefree childhood and youth. He spent his first years engrossed in his studies and far from political concerns. The tranquility of those years contributed doubtless to his decision to receive minor orders, which is why he is often referred to as the ‚Äúabate‚Äù Farsetti, though he never became a priest. In this context ‚Äúabate‚Äù, though literally the word means ‚Äúabbot‚Äù, was used at the time in a way similar to the French ‚Äúabb√©‚Äù as an honorific title for any cleric of minor rank. Farsetti spent much of his life travelling, visiting among other places Rome, Naples, Florence, and Paris. His interest was in establishing friendly relations with many men of culture. He was also a great patron of the arts and by his patronage contributed to the introduction into Venice of Neoclassicism. Collection at Ca' Farsetti The art collection he formed in his residence on the Grand Canal, Ca' Farsetti, was famous and became a sort of museum that was open to the curious, to artists, to his fellow citizens and to foreign tourists, and its visitors included Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The collection is known to have included 253 plaster casts of classical and modern sculptures (mostly by Ventura Furlani), various copies in oils by Luigi Pozzi of works executed in Rome by Raphael and by Annibale Carracci. There were also models by Antonio Chichi in cork and pumice stone of the best known monuments of ancient Rome, along with works in terracotta, bronze and ancient marble, as also landscapes by Flemish artists like Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck) and by other famous masters of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, including Titian, Antonio da Correggio, Salvator Rosa, Guercino, Tintoretto, Andrea del Sarto, Alessandro Magnasco, Pietro da Cortona, Padovanino, Giorgione, Luca Giordano, Palma Giovane and several of Farsetti's contemporaries, like Luca Carlevarijs, Sebastiano Ricci and Francesco Zuccarelli. As to the works in terracotta, it is known that there were several terracottas by Stefano Maderno, and several of Maderno's terracotta sketches, which are now in the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, where they arrived after Tsar Paul I of Russia began acquiring Farsetti's collection in 1800, the transfer being completed in 1805 by Tsar Alexander I . Among younger artists who frequented the collection were Antonio Canova, whose first sculptures were commissioned by Farsetti, who also patronized on a regular footing Francesco Algarotti. Farsetti also financed Alberto Fortis‚Äôs famous journey through Dalmatia. Villa Farsetti at Santa Maria di Sala Great admiration was also aroused by Farsetti‚Äôs villa at Santa Maria di Sala, created by transforming an existing property inherited from his uncle Anton Francesco Farsetti. Designed by Paolo Posi, Villa Farsetti distanced itself from the typical Venetian models to resemble in some regards Austrian tastes and anticipating neoclassical features. The entire complex included a reconstruction of Roman monuments of the Capitol, the Temple of Diana and that of Capitoline Jupiter, and also an enormous park decorated with statues, vases and artificial ruins. Of all the features, the most prominent was a botanical garden created with the advice of Louis Cl√©risson, full of rare and exotic plants. In fact, Farsetti himself was no mean botanist and was responsible, among other things, for introducing the magnolia into Italy. Last years Farsetti‚Äôs life did not end happily, since his lavish expenditure lead to financial difficulties and he was forced to sell many of his possessions. Moreover, a stroke left him mentally severely incapacitated. He had made a distant cousin, Daniele Filippo Farsetti, his heir.

Wasambo Boys High School Malawi, Africa In 2017 and in partnership with the University of Dayton, Determined to Develop commissioned a new boarding high school, Wasambo Boys High School which has established a national reach within its first year of inception. The first- year class of 75 students, is led by an international faculty, combining a half Malawian and have western-based staff. The existing school is home to approximately 500 male students who not only attend class‚Äîthey also live on the grounds. The proposed expansion will accommodate an additional 2,500 male and female students with greatly improved water facilities, capable of providing an estimated 500,000 liters per day. The school will be transformed from a high school into a technical college for post-secondary education. As the organization grew, staff members were added to the team and programming expanded. Although progress was being made in each of the development sectors, it was the educational programming that was having the most significant impact. Meanwhile, meetings with community stakeholders and a thorough needs assessment concluded that education was the top development priority for the region.

The Stein Song is a 1930 animated short film which is presented by Max Fleischer and was directed by Dave Fleischer. The film, which was animated by Rudy Zamara and Jimmie Culharne, features a sing- along version to \\"The Stein Song\\", which was written by Lincoln Colcord and was originally published in 1910. The song is also the school song for the University of Maine. The film also features a cameo of Rudy Vallee, who is featured half-way through the film, inviting the audience to also sing-along to the song. Copyrighted on 5 September 1930 and released on the same day, the film is part of the \\"follow the bouncing ball\\" series entitled Screen Songs. These films would instruct the audience to sing the title-song.  Plot  Rudy Vallee smiling. The film begins with a game of American football between Maine and Rutgers. Both sides begin to approach each other whilst they are both cheered on by their respective fans. Rutgers kick the ball first, which lands on a Maine player's head, whilst he is trying to catch it. Once the Maine player realises, he attempts to run across the field. Whilst he is doing this, the other team's players stop him by flinging themselves at the player. However when the other team plays, the Maine player is comically found morphed in the ball. So, once the ball is on the ground, the Maine player (who was still in the ball) kicks the ball over and into the goal, scoring a goal for the Maine's. The ball then transitions into the bouncing ball used in the sing-along sequence. An unnamed man then talks about The Stein Song, and about the song's rhythm. After the explanation, the narrator then introduces Rudy Vallee. Rudy Vallee then greets the audience and then invites the audience to sing-along to the \\"Stein Song\\" and to also follow the bouncing ball. Then, the song commences, sung by Rudy Vallee. In the second half of the film, multiple animals with flags of their universities begin to sing-along with Vallee, doing a verse each. After that, a Maine supporter begins to jump on the lyrics and begin to act like the bouncing ball. The lyrics lead him to a canoe with other mice. He commands the canoe until one of the rowers picks up a boot with his paddle and breaks the boat. The mouse then start to chant in the water. This makes the fish comically joining in their chanting. They both do this until the mice jump out of the water and the fish eat them. The film ends with the fish clapping. Characters In the film, there are a variety of characters. The main characters are the two teams who play American football during the first half of the film. There are also the supporters of both teams, who come in a plethora of species. There is also the cameo of Rudy Vallee, who invites the audience to sing-along during the song section. Reception The Stein Song was well received by the cinema magazines at the time.The Motion Picture News, 6 September 1930. The Film Daily said that the film was \\"snappy as well as tuneful\\" and also said that Fleischer did \\"an excellent job with the cartoon work and the bouncing ball windup\\".

The enthronement of the current king Sibulumbai Diedhiou in 2000 brought peace in parts of Oussouye Department which was engulfed in violence due to the ongoing Casamance conflict.A documentary about the King of Oussouye illustrates the role of tradition in Africa‚Äôs peace maintenance, Universitat de Barcelona (25/03/2014) (Retrieved 12 July 2019) The King also ensures that each of his people has food, distributing the rice from the royal fields, cultivated by the surrounding villagers. This rice is also used for the meal of the big annual festival called Houmabeul . This festival is held at the end of the winter , in September or early October 3. The current king of Oussouye is Sibilumba√Ø Diedhiou (Olivier Diedhiou before his enthronement). He was inducted on January 17, 2000, 16 years after the death of his predecessor Sibacouyane Diabone. The king is appointed by the elders. He comes from one of the three main families of Oussouye. The King resides in the sacred wood of the commune of Oussouye.

The term combines the two concepts of intrapreneurship and bricolage. Intrapreneurship uses principles and strategies from the discipline of entrepreneurship and applies them within the confines of an organization rather than initiating new ones. Borrow from the French word for \\"makeshift job\\", bricolage is a type of art using whatever media is at hand. In the context of intrapreneurial bricolage, intrapreneurs find innovative ways to work with a scarcity of resources.  Background  French anthropologist Claude L√©vi-Strauss In The Savage Mind, French anthropologist Claude L√©vi- Strauss discussed 'bricolage' as having roots in the French idea of a worker who uses his hands inventively to accomplish what other workers cannot. In his description of this jack-of-all-trades, L√©vi-Strauss explains that there is no requirement for skills and tools to be highly specialized. Instead, this 'bricoleur' is flexible enough to be able to use minimal resources for multiple applications.  Hidden Assets  One of the key principles of IB is finding utility in resources commonly overlooked. These resources can be divided into tangible and intangible assets. Often these assets are overlooked because they are obscured, dispersed or underutilized.

Whaling career  Tilton was born in Chilmark, Massachusetts to George Oliver Tilton and Hannah Sisson. He ran away from home at age 14, stowing himself aboard a New Bedford whaling schooner. By the time that he was discovered, the ship was too far from shore and the captain allowed him to stay. Tilton became a highly accomplished whaler, spending more than forty years at sea hunting whales from the equator to the arctic. In 1898, he was part of a whaling fleet that got caught in an ice pack off Point Barrow, and the fleet decided to send someone to get help out of fear of starvation and death. Tilton filled his pockets with crackers and set out to walk the 3,000 miles to help declaring, \\"if any one can make the trip, I can.\\" He later wrote: > Any Arctic whaler will tell you that, when a man goes into the Arctic, he is > a total stranger to the conditions every year. In thirty-two years that I > spent in the Arctic, I have never seen two summers alike as regards to ice.  Post-whaling life  Tilton served four years in the U.S. Navy during World War I. In 1917, he was hired by the Monjo Company to investigate the disappearance of the A. T. Gifford in Hudson Bay. He sailed on the schooner Pythian, investigated the accident, and determined that fire was the cause of the sinking. In 1925, Tilton was hired to supervise the overhaul of Charles W. Morgan and to serve as her \\"captain\\" when she was opened to the public. The ship was repaired in a sand berth at the Round Hill (Dartmouth, Massachusetts) estate of Edward Howland Robinson Green. In 1926, the Morgan opened to the public and had nearly two hundred thousand visitors. Tilton writes in his autobiography Cap‚Äôn George Fred Himself (1928): \\"perhaps we two, the ship and myself, compare pretty favorable ... now that we are not wanted to hunt whales anymore, we are laid up here so that people can get some idea of how the business used to be done. The ship is on exhibition, and I sometimes think I am too.\\" Tilton died in 1932 at age 71, and The New York Times published his obituary.

General  Unlike German Rummy, sets and runs of cards are not melded but collected in the player's hand until he is able either to declare \\"Rummy\\" and lay his hand on the table or to \\"knock\\" (klopfen) and meld all cards except for low-scoring 'deadwood'. Hence it is sometimes called Rummy without Melding (Romm√© ohne Auslegen), although that is strictly a variant of German Rummy where players receive 13, not 10, cards and may knock if they have fewer than 10, not 5, points. There is also no provision for players having one more go at improving their hand in the event of a knock.  Cards  Viennese Rummy is played with two packs of French playing cards of 52 cards and one joker each, making a total of 106 cards. It is suitable for two to six players. Each player is dealt ten cards, except for the dealer who receives eleven.  Rules  Like German Rummy, there are no standardised rules for Viennese Rummy. In fact a raft of almost identical games go under very different names including 101 Rummy and Elimination Rummy. Knock Rummy is a generic name for rummy games where players only reveal their hand at the end of the game. A related, two player, game is the popular Gin Rummy.Online Romme lernen - Romme Infoseite at www.online-romme-lernen.de. Retrieved 1 Jul 2018. The following rules are therefore not to be regarded as binding in the sense of chess rules. Unless otherwise stated, the rules of the game are the same as those for German Rummy.  Card values  The card values are as follows:Knock Rummy (Wiener Rummy) at www.rummy.ch. Retrieved 2 Jul 2018. * Joker - 20 points * Ace (Ass) - 11 points * Court cards ‚Äì K, Q, J ‚Äì 10 points each * Pip cards ‚Äì 2 to 10 ‚Äì score their value in pips  Play  Each player is dealt ten cards and the remainder placed face down in the middle of the table as the stock. The dealer turns the top card of the stock face up and places beside it to start the discard pile. In turn and beginning with forehand (left of dealer), players now draw either the upcard or the top card of the stock, reviewing their hand before discarding a card face up to the discard pile. The aim is to collect combinations of at least 3 cards, either as a set or as a run. However, unlike Romm√©, players do not meld their cards to the table but keep them in their hands. When a player has ten cards in melds he may go out, layout his melds on the table, and placing his eleventh card face down across the discard pile and say \\"rummy!\\" (Romm√©!). A player may also go out by knocking on the table if his unmelded card or cards are worth fewer than 5 points after discarding. In this case, the others have one more chance to improve their hand by drawing and discarding before the game ends.  Ending  A Rummy (Romm√©) declaration A game continues until one player calls \\"Rummy\\" (Romm√©), melds ten cards and discards the eleventh. The other players then lay out their cards and count them up as in Gin Rummy, by summing their deadwood, i.e. those that cannot be placed into sets or runs. The game can also be ended by \\"knocking\\" (klopfen): if a player has fewer than five card points in deadwood (cards left unmelded in the handParlett, David. The Penguin Book of Card Games. London: Penguin (2008), p. 488. . ), he can knock. He then reveals his hand as in a rummy call and announces his deadwood score. In this case, if a player has knocked, the others can try to improve their hand by drawing and discarding a card. They may not lay cards off on other players' melds. Then they declare their deadwood scores as normal.  Rubber  Viennese Rummy is usually played in 'rubbers'. One rubber consists of several individual games. Before a game begins, each player contributes five chips to the pot (Pot or Pulle). After each game, the knocker or rummy caller wins the so-called knock money, i.e. a chip from all other participants still in play. Furthermore, for each player the negative points (Schlechtpunkte) received in this game are noted and added cumulatively. Once a player has accumulated 101 or more points, they are eliminated; if all but one player is eliminated, the remaining player wins the pot and the game is over. If a player has already accumulated over 81 but not yet 101 negative points, he may 'buy himself back' into the pot by contributing an additional five chips and reducing his bad point score to that of the second worst player still in play. However, a player may only buy back once during the game.

All three members of the band (bassist/vocalist Mattie Jo Canino, guitarist/vocalist Phil Douglas and drummer Pat Schramm) are ex- members of Latterman. Tender Defender is considered by many to be a continuation of Latterman. The band released their self-titled debut on Dead Broke Rekerds on March 3, 2016. Background Following the break-up of Latterman, the members of the band went on to start several new projects- most notably Iron Chic, RVIVR, Laura Stevenson & The Cans and Bridge and Tunnel. Following the break up, the band stayed in touch and saw each other regularly between touring and Douglas producing several projects for both Canino and Schramm. In 2011, Latterman began playing occasional reunion shows which instigated the conversation of new music. Instead of releasing new music under the Latterman name and reform into a 4 piece, the band chose to record and perform as a 3-piece instead taking on the name Tender Defender with the core Latterman lineup of Douglas, Canino and Schramm. On the topic of not continuing as Latterman and forming a new band altogether, bassist/vocalist Mattie Jo Canino explained \\"Pat, Phil and I were the three most consistent members of Latterman anyways, the only people who are on every record and every tour besides our very first one. But actually it's Tender Defender, not Latterman. Kind of like how Jesus is 100% man and 100% God, except gayer and dirtier. I mean, we could have just called it Latterman but since we're not fucking poseurs we came up with a new band and some kick ass new jams. Also, of course it's fair to compare the two bands. It's the same people writing the same type of songs; we're just older, prettier and smarter now. Or maybe stupider, who knows.\\" On July 30, 2015, the band released their first single, \\"Hello Dirt\\", off of a tentative upcoming album. To coincide with the release of the single, the band played their first show at Saint Vitus in Brooklyn with Shellshag on August 16, 2015. The self-titled Mini-LP was recorded in Douglas' Hobo House studio with the artwork being done by Schramm. The album was released on March 3, 2016 on Dead Broke Rekerds to rave reviews. The band embarked on an international month long tour in April 2016 in support of the album. In 2018 Tender Defender announced new tour dates.

Clemson won the inaugural matchup by a score of 35‚Äì0. The Crimson Tide and Tigers met again in 1904 and 1905, with Clemson winning both games. Beginning with the next meeting between the two squads in 1909, Alabama won the next thirteen matchups against Clemson. The Tide posted the biggest margin of victory in the rivalry in 1931, whopping the Tigers by a margin of 74‚Äì7. In the first seven games of Alabama's 13-game streak, Clemson only scored seven total points and was shut out in six of the seven games. After a 56‚Äì0 shutout Alabama victory in 1975, the squads didn't meet again until 2008, when they squared off on opening weekend in Atlanta, Georgia. The Tide emerged with a 34‚Äì10 victory. The last four matchups between the squads had national championship implications and have greatly intensified the rivalry.

Investigation into her death led to a conclusion of in-person and cyberbullying contributing to the decision to take her own life. Sedwick's family later filed a lawsuit in relation to her death.  Background, history and suicide  Rebecca and her family were originally from Sebring, Florida. While battling with depression and anxiety, she began to engage in self-mutilation by cutting. At one point, Rebecca was hospitalized for three days as a result of her actions. After returning to school, an incident in a hallway with another student played a role in the decision to remove Rebecca from public school and begin the process of homeschooling. Her mother also deactivated her social media accounts and took away her mobile phone. After returning to the public school system and transferring to another school to give her a fresh start, Rebecca was given her mobile phone privileges back and she opened accounts on services such as Kik, Ask.fm and Voxer. Snapshots later emerged of anonymous comments that were written to Rebecca on Ask.fm saying things like ‚ÄúNobody cares about you‚Äù, ‚Äúyou seriously deserve to die‚Äù and ‚Äúdrink bleach and die.‚Äù It was later determined that, as the bullying grew worse, Rebecca was beginning to have suicidal thoughts. These thoughts were discovered to have begun about a year prior to her death. The investigation also showed new conflicts with students at school and Rebecca was withdrawn from public school in February 2013. A search of Rebecca's mobile phone and computer uncovered internet searches like, ‚ÄúWhat is overweight for a 13 year-old girl?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow much Advil do you have to overdose in order to die?‚Äù Pictures of Sedwick with razor blades lying on her arms were shown on her mobile phone and her mobile phone wallpaper showed pictures of her head resting on the edge of a railroad track. Before her death, she changed her name on one of her mobile phone apps to ‚ÄúThat Dead Girl,‚Äù and messaged a 12-year-old friend in North Carolina saying, \\"I'm jumping, I can't take it anymore.\\" Following a media investigation, it was revealed that, a week prior to Rebecca's death, she received messages on her phone asking her why she was still alive and telling her to go kill herself. On September 9, 2013, Sedwick was found dead after jumping off an abandoned cement plant. At the time of her death, Sedwick was a grade 8 student at Crystal Lake Middle School in Lakeland, Florida.  Investigation and arrest  On September 17, 2013, 12-year-old Katelyn Roman and 14-year-old Guadalupe Shaw, were charged with aggravated stalking, and accused of bullying Sedwick during an argument over a boy. The charges would later be dropped due to a lack of evidence.  Aftermath and reaction  Sedwick's mother refuted claims that she was accountable for Rebecca's death and vowed to work with lawmakers in Florida to strengthen anti-bullying laws. However, some experts, like Debbie Johnston, national legislative liaison for Bully Police USA, say that the \\"laws are there\\" and that society needs to \\"have a culture that tells us this is what‚Äôs right to do‚Äù. The circumstances of Sedwick's death were compared to another Florida teenager that committed suicide after aggressive bullying seven years before. Others have said that, ‚ÄúThe problem is not the kids reporting suicidal thoughts and bullying, the problem is usually the adults who do not listen and follow up.‚Äù Others have said that parents need to have a greater idea of what their children are doing, both on and off-line, because teenagers cannot self-regulate. Sedwick's mother established the Rebecca Sedwick Funeral Fund and Anti-Bullying Campaign, receiving donations to support anti-bullying awareness education and programs for children and teens with mental health problems. The campaign's goal was to raise $5,400 to pay for the costs of Rebecca's funeral, with any additional funds being donated to The Jaylens Challenge Foundation, a local non-profit organization dedicated to promoting awareness and prevention of bullying through education and community service.

The main lithology is Clay, Marl, Siltstone and Sandstone, with a minor Conglomerate component. Coal seams have also been noted.. It is notable for its fossils including those of dinosaurs and plants.  Vertebrate paleofauna  All remains have been found at a single locality, which is a thin marl seam in the Konstantin mining tunnel, within the Felbering Mine in the Neue Welt area north west of Muthmannsdorf in Lower Austria. The initial remains were discovered in 1859 after an Ornithopod tooth was found in a piece of coal in a dump outside the mine by Professor F. Stolizcka, and the productive seam discovered thereafter. The first material was described by Emanuel Bunzel in 1871 and then additional material was described by Harry Seeley in 1881. Due to mining activity in the area ceasing at the end of the 19th century, no additional remains have been recovered since.

His earlier works focused on the harsh urban environment of Harlem where he spent his childhood, though he is most notable for his dreamlike, nostalgic images that took place in a rural Southern childhood.Hanks, Eric. \\"A Child of the Universe...Speak Like a Child ‚Äì Mildred Thompson and Walter Williams.\\" International Review of African American Art, 2007. Williams made a number of trips to Denmark, where he felt he could reach his full potential. Later in 1979, he became a Danish citizen at the expense of losing his American citizenship.  Early life  Williams was born on August 11, 1920 in Brooklyn, New York.Williams, Walter. R√©sum√©. [1963]. He spent the majority of his youth in Harlem, by attending \\"jukebox joints, the local pool halls, and the few nightclubs that catered to black clientele.\\" There, he met many artists of various fields. With their influence, and his \\"early artistic talent\\" he decided to become a painter.Driskell, David C. The Other Side of Color: African American Art in the Collection of Camille O. and William H. Cosby Jr. Pomegranate, 2001. His mother, compassionate and also an artist, died from pneumonia when Williams was five. His strict, authoritative father then took custody of him and his younger sister. Due to the death of his mother, and a non-nurturing father, he became withdrawn from others, preferring to live in his own dream world.  Personal life  Williams had three children by two wives. His first two children, Ronald and Larry, were birthed by his wife Shirley. Shirley did not approve of him becoming a painter because of the lack of security and stability, so Williams left her and his two children to pursue his passion. His second wife, Marlena, whom he met in Denmark at one of his exhibitions birthed his last child, Darius. Born in 1973, he also became an artist, following in his father's footsteps. In his adulthood, Williams continued to be shy and was described as \\"reserved.\\" He often suffered from depression and struggled with alcoholism. During his time in Mexico, he was treated for his depression and was given medication.  Career   WWII -> Education (1942‚Äì1955)  Williams was drafted into the army from 1942 to 1945. His assignment was to an all-black unit in France. His job was to dig soldier's graves. His son Darius reports that Walter witnessed the burial of an alive soldier. Grim and dreary, it \\"haunted him the rest of life.\\"Texas Southern University. Walter Williams Exhibition, 1962. Under the G.I. Bill, he enrolled at the Brooklyn Museum Art School in 1951. Despite being a poor high school student, Williams was scholarly and paid close attention to his lessons. In the summer of 1953, under a scholarship he studied at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. That same year, he participated in his first major group show, the Whitney's 1953 Annual Exhibition of Contemporary American Painting. He graduated in 1955.  Education -> Denmark (1955‚Äì1959)  After graduating, Williams won the award for the John Hay Whitney Foundation fellowship, amounting him $2,400. His grandfather, who was from the Danish West Indies, spoke well of the country; thus, Williams used the money to travel to Denmark. The direction of his art changed significantly‚Äîit previously reflected isolation in the city, and now, the beauty of the countryside. Bornholm, a small Danish island with \\"fantastic nature\\" awestruck Williams, influencing this change. In February 1966, his newer works were exhibited at the Noa Noa Gallery in Copenhagen, Denmark. Out of 19 paintings, 12 were sold and remain in Danish collections.Preston, Stuart. \\"The Point of View.\\" The New York Times, 1954.  Denmark -> Mexico -> United States (1959‚Äì1964)  Williams spent four years in Mexico from 1959 to 1963. He had his work shown in various exhibitions, such as the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. He traveled back and forth to the United States as he had shows there as well. He explained to a Mexican reporter that the way of living was more \\"pleasant\\" than in the United States, leading to him to stay longer than he expected. He felt that by living in a racially liberal Mexico, that \\"the freedom from racial prejudice was essential\\" for his personal and artistic development. In 1963, he returned to the United States, but only for a year due to the racial climate.  United States -> Denmark (1964‚Äì1965)  In 1964, Williams won $1000 as a part of the Silvermine Guild Award for Oil Painting. He used this to finance a second trip to Denmark (more specifically, Copenhagen). Shortly after his arrival, he organized an exhibition entitled \\"Ten American Negro Artists Living and Working in Europe.\\" The other artists featured were Harvey Cropper, Beauford Delaney, Herbert Gentry, Arthur Hardie, Clifford Jackson, Sam Middleton, Earl Miller, Norma Morgan and Larry Potter.  Denmark -> United States (1965‚Äì1966)  In 1965, Williams returned to New York as his woodcut, Girl with Butterflies #2, was purchased by the National Collection of Fine Arts of the Smithsonian Institution for the Executive Wing of the White House during the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. Proud to have a piece in the White House, he attended a special reception in commemoration. The racial climate didn't improve; Williams was often anxious and depressed due to discrimination against interracial marriage (his wife at the time was Danish). After a year, Williams couldn't take it any longer and told his wife to take him \\"home,\\" meaning Denmark. He had left the United States to never come back again.  Final years (1966‚Äì1998)  Williams spent his final years in Copenhagen. In 1979, he had lived there for 14 years; his wife urged him to become a Danish citizen and he did so. In 1980, his studio was completely destroyed by fire, losing all of his paintings and prints. Depressed, he was unable to work for several months. In 1983, he stopped making art altogether, as he's said everything he wants with his art. His health started to decline and he began to withdraw from friends. His last exhibition was in 1985, at the International Art Fair in Tokyo, Japan, representing Denmark. His health worsening, he died in 1998 due to liver cancer. He was 77 years old.

At this point, the Royal Danish Theatre did not yet have an organized school, and the actors was instructed by lessons from seniors. After a study trip to Paris in 1775, Schwarz saw a need for an organized learning of acting, and started to give lessons in what he had learned in Paris. He saw a need for more organized teaching, and therefore founded the academy. It was given a room used for singing lessons by Royal Danish Theatre to meet. The members was composed of actors from the Royal Danish Theatre: the majority of the younger actors from the royal stage came to be members. The members of the academy provided each other with constructive criticism of their performances in a time when there where no organized official critic of the stage performances in Denmark, in an effort to raise the quality of acting. The academy also acted as a testing stage for new plays, and criticized the outdated way of costume used on the royal theater and opted for a reform. In March 1778, the academy stage the play Balders D√∏d in Hoftheatret, which was described as a success. Det Dramatiske Selskab was successful and achieved reform in costume and repertoire on the Danish national stage. In 1779, the academy was dissolved because of inner conflicts, but replaced by a proper organized acting school at the Royal Danish Theatre, where Frederik Schwarz was made instructor.

She is a two- time U.S. national champion (2019, 2020). Liu is the youngest-ever U.S. ladies' national champion, having won her first title at age 13. On the junior level, she is the 2020 World Junior bronze medalist, the 2019‚Äì20 Junior Grand Prix Final silver medalist, the 2019 JGP United States champion, the 2019 JGP Poland champion, and the 2018 U.S. junior national champion. She was the first junior American female skater to successfully complete a triple Axel in international competition, and the third American female skater overall to do so after Tonya Harding and Mirai Nagasu. She was also the first American female skater to successfully complete a quad jump (quadruple Lutz) in competition. Liu is the first ladies skater to ever land both a quadruple jump and a triple axel in the same program. Early life Liu was born on August 8, 2005, in Clovis, California, the oldest child of Arthur Liu, an attorney who immigrated to the U.S. from a small mountain village in the Sichuan, China in the 1990s at the age of 25, after earning degrees in China. He was further educated in California, earning M.B.A. and J.D. degrees. Liu is the oldest of five children; like her siblings (a sister and triplets‚Äîtwo boys and a girl), she was conceived through an anonymous egg donor and a surrogate mother. She attended Chinese school for three years, then attended the Oakland School for the Arts, which, at the time, offered an emphasis in figure skating. When she started missing too much school due to traveling to competitions, she began homeschooling at her father's law office in between practices. She uses the same online program that other skaters, including fellow Bay Area skaters Karen Chen and Vincent Zhou, have used. Career Early career Liu began skating at the age of five, when her father, a fan of Michelle Kwan, brought her to the Oakland Ice Center. She began taking group lessons with her coach, Laura Lipetsky, a former figure skater who had trained under Frank Carroll, and quickly moved to individual sessions. Her coach, Laura Lipetsky, began teaching her at 5¬Ω years old and her choreographer, Cindy Stuart, also started working with her when she was young. Liu's first skating competition was as a juvenile in 2015, when she came in seventh place at the Central Pacific Regionals. At the 2016 U.S. Championships, she became the youngest female skater to earn the intermediate gold medal, winning by less than a point. She was first after the short program; her free skate included two triple Salchows, the first completed in combination with a double toe loop and earning her a \\"program-high 7.00 points\\". Competing in the novice category, Liu placed fourth at the 2017 U.S. Championships. She was in first place after her short program, with a 1.22 point lead. Her short program included a split jump into a triple Lutz-triple toe loop combination, which was ruled under- rotated, and a triple flip. Liu fell to fourth place after the long program, where she landed two triple-triple combinations but did not earn sufficient program component scores to retain her narrow lead. 2017‚Äì18 season: National junior champion Liu opened her season with a silver medal at the 2017 Asian Open Trophy, where she finished second to Japan's Mana Kawabe. She was the youngest skater to compete in the junior division at the 2018 U.S. Championships in San Jose, California. She won the competition, despite suffering from a cold and sore throat. She scored a season's best in the short program with an almost seven-point lead going into the free skate. Her short program included three level-4 spins, a triple flip-triple toe loop combination, and a triple Lutz, earning her 63.83 points. She earned 120.33 points during her long program, after landing two double Axels and seven triple jumps, which were all backloaded in the second half of the program. Liu was given extra points on all her jumps, except for the triple flip-single loop-triple Salchow combination. She earned an overall score of 184.16 points, almost 18 more than silver medalist Pooja Kalyan and the second highest-ever score on the junior level. Despite winning the gold, Liu was ineligible to compete at the 2018 World Junior Championships because she was not old enough. She was sent to the 2018 International Challenge Cup instead, where she won the advanced novice silver medal behind Hanna Yoshida of Japan. 2018‚Äì19 season: First senior national title In August 2018, Liu competed as a novice at the 2018 Asian Open Trophy in Bangkok, Thailand. She won the gold, outscoring the silver medalist, Japan's Sara Honda, by over ten points. She landed a ratified triple Axel in the free skate, becoming the youngest skater in history to perform a clean triple Axel in competition and the fourth American female skater to do so, following Tonya Harding, Kimmie Meisner, and Mirai Nagasu. Although Liu was too young to compete internationally at the senior or junior level, she qualified to compete in the senior ranks at the 2019 U.S. Championships in Detroit, Michigan. On January 25, 2019, she broke Tara Lipinski's previous record by becoming the youngest skater to win the U.S. senior women's title, after placing second in the short to defending U.S. champion Bradie Tennell with a record score (which was broken minutes later by Tennell), and first in the free skate. She became the youngest female skater to land a triple Axel at the U.S. Nationals, as well as the third female skater to do so (after Harding and Meissner), and the first female skater to do so during a short program at Nationals. She was also the first female skater to complete three triple Axels in U.S. competition. Liu scored 73.89 points in her short program, 2.71 points behind Tennell, the leader after the short program.Schwindt, p. 12 In the long program, Tennell and Mariah Bell, who took third place in the short program, both made errors, \\"\\"opening the door for Liu\\". Her program component score \\"fell well short of Tennell's and Bell's\\", but her technical scores made up the difference, and she posted an overall score of 217.51.Schwindt, p. 13 She completed two consecutive triple Axels, including the first one in combination, during her long program, and out of the other six triples she completed (one of which was also in combination), only the flip was downgraded. Since Liu was too young to compete at both the junior and senior level World Championships, her season ended in January, after U.S. Nationals, which gave her time to work on her skating skills and choreography with Italian skater Carolina Kostner in Rome, an arrangement made by her coach, Laura Lipetsky. She began working with Italian choreographer and Olympic ice dancing competitor, Massimo Scali, who is now based in Oakland, also on her skating skills and choreography the end of 2019. 2019‚Äì20 season: International junior debut Liu's first competition for the 2019‚Äì2020 season was at the inaugural Aurora Games, an international all- female competition held in August 2019. She earned perfect scores, led the U.S. team to first place overall, and was the first American female skater to successfully complete a quadruple Lutz in competition, albeit in one not sanctioned by the ISU. Liu made her international competition debut at the ISU Junior Grand Prix in Lake Placid in August 2019. Skating to \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\" by Barbra Streisand in her short program, she scored 69.30 points, breaking her own personal best short program record by almost 20 points. She completed all her jumps, including three triples, completed three level-4 spins, and earned positive grades of execution for all seven elements. During her long program, Liu became the first American female skater to complete a quadruple Lutz in a competition. She also became the first female skater to complete a quadruple jump and a triple Axel in the same program in a competition. Skating to pianist Jennifer Thomas‚Äô version of ‚ÄúNew World Symphony,\\" which was choreographed by Lori Nichol, Liu started her long program with a triple Axel-double toe loop combination, followed by her quadruple Lutz, which she earned 13.80 points for. She fell on her second triple Axel, but was able to successfully execute her following six triple jumps. She also earned level-4 scores for her three spins and top marks for her step sequence, earning a 59.66 program component score. She won the event by 21.52 points over the silver medalist, South Korean Park Yeon-jeong. It was the first in 20 Junior Grand Prix events that a non-Russian skater won and the first time an American won a Junior Grand Prix event since Polina Edmunds in 2013. Liu's second slot in the Junior Grand Prix was in Poland. She came in fourth after the short program, but came from behind to win the event. In her short program, she completed, at the start of her program, a triple Axel- triple toeloop, the first in Junior Grand Prix history. She doubled a planned triple loop, trailing by a little over four points going into the free skate. In her free skate, Liu \\"just about held onto\\" her first jump, a triple Axel, but improved as she went along, completing a combination that included a double toeloop. She then completed a quadruple Lutz, a \\"much better\\" triple Axel, a triple loop, and \\"two excellent combinations‚Äîtriple Lutz-triple toeloop and triple Lutz-Euler-triple Salchow\\". She ended her program with a triple flip, and earned three level-4 spins. She earned a season's best score of 138.99 in the free skate and 203.10 overall. She qualified for the Junior Grand Prix Final in second place, the first American female skater to do so since Karen Chen and Polina Edmunds in 2013, with 30 points. Liu won the silver medal at the Junior Grand Prix Final behind Russia's Kamila Valieva and ahead of Daria Usacheva, also of Russia. A little over two points separated the first and fourth place skaters in the short program. Liu placed first in the short program, with a triple Axel-triple toe combination and 71.09 points, a little over one-point lead. Although her jumps were the most difficult in her long program and she successfully completed six triple jumps, both her quadruple Lutzes and a triple Axel were judged underrotated, and she fell on her opening triple Axel, placing her second in the free skate and second overall. She told reporters afterwards, \\"I think I should have only done one quad but I really wanted to go for it just for the fun of it\\". Liu entered the 2020 U.S. Championships as the favorite to defend her title. She placed second in the short program after turning out of her triple Axel attempt, but successfully landed a triple flip and a triple Lutz-triple toe combination, as well executing level-4 spins and footwork. She earned 75.40 points, a little over 3.50 points behind Bradie Tennell; she also had a technical base value advantage of more than 16 points over both Tennell and Bell. Skating last and immediately after Mariah Bell's \\"elegant, near flawless performance\\" to k.d. lang's version of the Leonard Cohen song \\"Hallelujah\\", Liu won the free skate by over eight points, with a score of 160.12, which was her career-best, and 235.52 points overall. Her final score was over 10 points higher than Bell's, who came in second place, and just under 15 points over Tennell's, who came in third. Although she failed to be the first woman at U.S. Nationals to successfully complete a quadruple Lutz, which was called under-rotated and received negative grade of execution scores, her \\"triple Axels were solid, and her final two spins were of surpassing quality\\". She landed two triple Axels in the first 65 seconds of her program, and then completed six more triple jumps. Liu told reporters afterwards, \\"This year I‚Äôm thinking, it‚Äôs a new decade, like, wow, what a good start!\\" At the age of 14, Liu's win made her the youngest two-time women's U.S. champion and the first woman in seven years to win back-to-back U.S. championships, since Ashley Wagner in 2012 and 2013 and since Michelle Kwan won 8 consequence titles. Bell and Tennell assisted Liu to the top tier of the podium during the awards ceremony, recreating what they did the previous year. Liu was age-ineligible to compete in international senior-level competitions, but was named to the 2020 World Junior Championships team, alongside Starr Andrews and Lindsay Thorngren. Liu came into her first World Junior Championships ranked third in the world among juniors; ultimately, she placed third, behind Valieva and Usacheva. She came in fourth after her short program; according to ESPN, she did not \\"skate nearly as well at the past two national championships\\", and lost points for an under-rotation and negative grade of execution, but she successfully completed a triple Axel-triple toe loop combination jump, earning 67.52 points. In her \\"solid\\" long program, Liu earned the second-highest technical score, with 137.31 points, came in third place in the long program, and earned a cumulative score of 204.83 points. She under-rotated her opening triple Axel and fell on her quadruple Lutz, but successfully landed a triple Axel and six more triple jumps, and earned level-four spins and footwork. On June 22, 2020, Liu announced that she was leaving longtime coach Laura Lipetsky and that she had hired coaches Lori Nichol and Massimo Scali, who she started working with in 2019, as well as Lee Barkell. Liu plans to remain based in Oakland, California in the Bay Area, where Scali primarily works, while communicating with Nichol and Barkell via online video conferencing and occasionally traveling to their base in Toronto, Canada.

The park and playing fields were donated by Sir Norman Rae in 1920 and the playing fields are known as the Norman Rae fields, but are part of the park itself. The park adjoins the town of Shipley to its eastern and northern sides, and Heaton to the south, with Northcliffe Golf Club also bordering the park on the western side. Bradford Model Engineering Society have two demonstration and ride-on lines within the park which are open to public in the summer. The area was historically known as North Cliff, which over time became Northcliffe. History The site was used to mine coal and quarry sandstone and fireclay from the 17th to early 20th centuries. Research has uncovered more than 40 coal shafts and at least ten quarry sites. The was donated in June 1920 by Sir Norman Rae. The area was due to be sold during 1919 and a remark by Rae to a colleague about how it would benefit the people of shipley, prompted Rae to follow his own advice and after the sale at auction fell through, he purchased the land and had it adapted into a park, though the current main entrance to the playing fields opposite the \\"Branch Junction\\" in Shipley, did not open until 1929. The area was historically written as North Cliff which during the 20th century became first Northcliff and then Northcliffe. Written records for deciding the space and borders of the allotments lists the site as being North Cliff Woods. Care and maintenance of the park was the remit of Shipley Urban District Council which was absorbed into Bradford Council in 1974. The park consists of the woodland, parkland, allotments and the Sir Norman Rae playing fields. The playing fields were previously the site of the nine-hole Shipley Golf Course which had been on the site since 1897. The 18-hole Northcliffe Golf Club now straddles the north and western edges of the park, though some evidence of the previous golf course on the playing fields can be seen. Bowling, tennis and cricket are available to play in the park with the addition of a fenced-in play area for children. During the Second World War, crops were grown in the park by Land Army girls for the war effort. A small stream known as Northcliffe Dike cuts through the southern part of the park (known as Northclife Woods) and joins up with Red Beck (from Heaton Woods) before flowing into Bradford Beck between Frizinghall and Shipley. The Friends of Northcliffe Woods carried out remediation on the beck and its ponds in 2010 and 2011. The engine is on the upper line in Northcliffe Woods, Shipley, West Yorkshire. The shorter raised loop is in the foreground. Bradford Council have actively let a wildflower meadow grow in the woods. Previously, the grass was kept short, but since 2010 has been allowed to grow with only small footpaths cut through it. This has helped ghost moths to proliferate and this was highlighted on the BBC One programme, The One Show. Two Ancient Semi Natural Woodlands (ASNW) exist within the park; Old Spring Wood is to the northern end of the park and Northcliffe Woods are the southern end of the park with Northcliffe Dike running through them and a stone incised with cup and ring marks. The Norman Rae Gala is held annually in the park in either June or July. The event has many rides, stalls and artists performing in the fields and also in the woodland. Bradford Model Engineering Society operate two railway tracks in the woodland area of the park. The gauges vary between and on a raised oval track that runs for and a larger loop that runs on the ground for and takes trains of and gauges. The society is one of the oldest model engineering societies in Britain (founded in 1908) and operates the railways in summer for passengers weather permitting. The society refer to, and label their railway, as Northcliff Railway using one of the older spellings of the name.

History Cockburn was born in Hamilton, New South Wales, the eighth of nine children of Richard T. Henderson (c. 1830‚Äì1897) and was educated at Hamilton and Lawrence public schools. He passed the public instruction examination at age 13 and was admitted to Macquarie Superior Public School as a pupil teacher under his brother Richard Henderson. In December 1889 he won a ¬£72 per annum scholarship to the Fort Street Training College. He matriculated the following March and in so doing won two-years' free tuition at Sydney University, later extended by another year. He graduated BA in March 1893, winning a gold medal in philosophy, the Fraser Scholarship in History, and the James King of Irrawang Travelling Scholarship of ¬£110 for two years, and in 1894 he enrolled at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was awarded a Brackenbury Scholarship in history which funded his studies there to the value of ¬£80 per annum for five years. He also excelled at athletics and was a leading oarsman and member of the Balliol crew at the Henley and Oxford races. He graduated MA and was employed in various parts of England as a University extension lecturer. In recognition of his highly successful work, he was promoted by the Oxford extension delegacy to first-class lecturer. In 1898 he accepted a position at Sydney University as Acting Professor of History, while Professor Wood was on holiday in England. On 5 January 1899, two days before leaving, he married May Gertrude Sturge, a niece of John Bright and of Joseph Sturge, at the Friends' Meeting Place, Leicester, England. They arrived in Sydney aboard the P & O steamer Oceana in late February. A second acting Professorship, of Philosophy, arose at Sydney University, which Henderson filled, in 1900 returning to England, living at Kingham, and at Charlbury, in Oxfordshire, the home of his wife's parents. Early in 1902 Henderson was invited to give a course of lectures in Sydney, and while he was in Australia Professor Douglas peremptorily resigned, and the University of Adelaide offered him the chair of History (or perhaps his friend William Mitchell, professor of English and Philosophy, persuaded him to apply); he accepted and took up residence in North Adelaide. He attempted to persuade his wife to join him, but she repeatedly declined. By 1910 she was living with the newspaper editor Richard Henry Gretton, and Henderson instituted divorce proceedings. Henderson was spending much of his spare time at the Adelaide Club. In 1921 Mrs G. A. Jury made a bequest to the University, which enabled Henderson's dual responsibilities to be divided: A. T. Strong was appointed to the Jury professorship of English Literature in 1922, and Henderson retained the Professorship of Modern History. On 27 October 1922 Henderson married Dr. Annie Heloise Abel (1873‚Äì1947), an English-born Professor of History in America, with an interest in American colonial history. They settled on a rural property at Blackwood, but she was unhappy; he suffered a nervous breakdown and was hospitalised in June 1923 and insisted she leave him; they divorced on the grounds of incompatibility. Henderson's resignation from the University was accepted reluctantly and he was awarded the title of Professor Emeritus. He moved to Dora Creek, New South Wales in 1923. He continued his historical researches; notably on Abel Tasman with M. Wieder, the Dutch historian. He was cared for over the course of 20 years by his niece Elsie Henderson, who lived next door to his \\"cozy villa\\". When the pair visited England in 1936 he arranged for Elsie to be presented to the court of King Edward VIII (later Duke of Windsor). Henderson was depressed and his life was complete after completing a book. Elsie found him on 9 April 1944 near the road on his property, throat slit, with a razor under his body.

Following World War II the building returned to the possession of its previous German-American owners; it continues today to be a popular venue for German-themed events in Seattle. It was designated a Seattle Landmark in 1983. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Assay Office in 1972. History The structure's history dates back to 1893 when local newspaper publisher and civic leader hired architect John B. Parkinson to design a two story and basement brick building with two store rooms on the ground floor and a public hall above which would be known as Prosch Hall. Prosch was also a collector of photographs by local photographers and wrote books on the Puget Sound region. In anticipation of the gold that would soon start flowing into Seattle from the Yukon gold fields, the government began a search for a detached building away from the central business district with capacity for the assay office and minting facilities to mold the gold nuggets and flakes into bricks to ship to the mint at San Francisco. In June of 1898 Prosch eagerly leased his entire building to the federal government for use as the assay office and mint. Fred A. Wing was appointed to open and run the facility. Members of the Westminster Presbyterian Church who still held an unexpired lease on the upstairs hall took exception to this deal and barricaded themselves inside the building, hurling legal threats at Prosch and the workers trying to access the building. With the government's deal resting on a firm opening date, Prosch was quick to meet the church's demands to get them off the property. The stand-off only lasted a day and remodeling was able to proceed for in time for the July 15 opening date. By the following year it was taking in more gold than any other assay office in the United States. Later additions to the original building included a vault room added on the south side of the building in the early 1900s that was later built up into the short 2 story annex seen today. By the late 1920s gold deposits had declined markedly and, in 1932, the building ceased to be used as an assay office. In 1935 the building was taken over by Deutsches Haus (German Club), an organization for Seattleites of German descent, becoming their social center. It was used as a Navy entertainment center during World War II before returning to the possession of its previous German owners.Hard Drive to the Klondike: Promoting Seattle During the Gold Rush nps.govBerlin Bakery Beatdown at 9th and James, 1905 and 2011 capitolhillseattle.com Today, its affairs are administered by the German Heritage Society in Seattle; it plays host to a diverse array of Germanic activities including traditional concerts and balls. Lectures on the building's historic roots have also taken place here. On July 6, 1983, the city of Seattle's Landmark Preservation Board designated German House as a Seattle Landmark. It had previously been added to the National Register of Historic Places in March 1972.

Authorities seized over 4.5 million euros' worth of cryptocurrency, as well as 788,606 doses of LSD; these are the largest seizures of cryptocurrency and LSD in European history. The operation was revealed to the public on June 28, 2018.  Background  A designer drug is a structural or functional analog of a controlled substance that has been designed to mimic the pharmacological effects of the original drug, while avoiding classification as illegal and/or detection in standard drug tests. These drugs have been designated by the European Union as new psychoactive substances (NPS). In 2005 the American Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) conducted Operation Web Tryp to shut down US based designer drug vendors. On March 21, 2018, several drug vendor sourcing subreddits were shut down, including /r/RCSources and /r/DarkNetMarkets. On June 27, 2018 (one day before the public reveal of Operation DRYER) it was reported that US Homeland Security special agents concluded an undercover operation to shut down darknet vendors; they arrested over 40 people and seized more than $20 million in guns, drugs, cars, gold, and cryptocurrency. This operation may or may not be connected to Operation DRYER.  Details  The investigation began in 2015, with the interception of a package in Hof (Bavaria) by the German police, containing several designer drugs substances. The shipment, from a post office box in Ogijares (Granada), pointed to the existence of a criminal structure based in that Spanish province. Investigators detected a large number of packages and postal envelopes being sent from Ogijares to more than 100 countries of all continents, with the exception of Africa. The criminal network began operating in 2012 and initially imported the precursors for the designer drugs from China. After China increased criminal penalties for the production of designer drugs, the criminal network installed a laboratory in Amsterdam, and two chemical engineers were hired to synthesize the designer drugs. Numerous laboratory grade materials were found such as chromatographs, crushing machines and other equipment used for drug analysis and production. Later, laboratories were set up in Alhend√≠n and in La Pobla de Vallbona. On March 7 all members of the operation were arrested, consisting of eight people of Spanish, Austrian, and French nationality. Seven of these people were part of the same Spanish family, with the exception of one Frenchman. The value of the remaining substances found in the laboratories is estimated to be 12 million euros. Authorities seized 509 bitcoins (worth at the time 4.5 million euros), as well as 167,000 euros of other cryptocurrencies. This is the largest seizure of cryptocurrency in Europe ever. Also seized were numerous bank accounts containing a total of 2 million euros; 3 real estate properties worth altogether 1 million euros; 10 luxury vehicles; and more than 650,000 euros in cash. 700,000 euros was laundered through Hawala networks. In total the organization is estimated to have laundered more than 40 million euros.  Substances found  More than 100 substances were produced at the lab, including synthetic cannabinoids, depressants, dissociatives, stimulants such as amphetamines and cathinones, nootropics, psychedelics and opioids. 788,606 doses of LSD were located in the Valencia laboratory, making this the largest seizure of LSD in Europe ever.

History  The original hotel was established in Lambie Street around 1858, less than twenty years after settlement in Cooma first commenced in 1839. Early settlement concentrated in and around Lambie Street which became the focal point of the community activity at the time. In 1986 several alterations were made to the exterior of the Royal Hotel. Stonework repair involved the steam cleaning and repoint of the front of the hotel. Replacement of lacework was undertaken with a loyalty to the original style. New gutters, downpipes and valley were installed. Sheets of iron for the roof on flat and toilet roof were used to restore the buildings original splendor.

The original design of the station was attributed to John Whitton. The station complex was built from 1889 to 1950. The Cooma Monaro Railway is based at the station and maintains an active presence although services have not operated since 2014. The station was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Bombala railway line was completed to Cooma in 1889. The construction contract for the Michelago to Cooma section was awarded to Walker & Swan on 18 August 1885. Cooma station was opened on 31 May 1889 and by then a substantial complex had been built to provide a large town and developing district the benefits which rail could bring to the area. The complex then comprised a five-room station building with separate toilet block and lamp room, located at each, a platform, a station master's residence, locomotive shed with turntable, coal stage, ash pits, water columns and water tank, a goods yard with shed, platform, office and gantry crane, a wool loading bank and stockyards, a water supply, a rest house and an interlocking machine. Improvements were made every few years to the railway yard. In 1912 a signal box was erected on the Cooma platform, replacing the original interlocking system, and the line was extended to Nimmitabel. Cooma station was busy during the war years as the local departure point for troops. A number of modifications and improvements were carried out in the early 20th century. A major fire destroyed the locomotive shed in 1923 and it was rebuilt in 1925. A refreshment room opened in the station building in 1922 and six years later a larger refreshment room was created incorporating the southern storage area. In 1940 a new rest house or barracks was constructed to house 12 men and the original rest house demolished in 1944. The station was busy again during World War II when army recruits from all over the district gathered to travel to the army base at Goulburn. The era of the Snowy Mountains Scheme, from the 1950s to 1970s, prompted further changes such as additional facilities and upgrading from steam to diesel locomotives. The Scheme was the largest engineering project ever undertaken in Australia, and provided a major source of employment for post-war migrants. Overall 100,000 people worked on the Scheme between 1949 and 1974, two-thirds of them being migrants from more than 30 countries. The Goulburn to Cooma railway line became the lifeline for the Scheme, with passenger trains transporting the workers and their families to and from Cooma. The Railway Institute Building constructed in 1958 is indicative of the expansion of Cooma during this period: \\"The Railway Institute was the railway's focal point for the majority of employee training, apprenticeships and scholarships for the large number of trade and non-trade personnel required to maintain and run the continually expanding railway system. The Institute created branches in major country towns and‚Ä¶ they were not only the local focal point for training and education, but became the meeting place for the community to participate in various sporting and social activities in the town with many dances and dinners being held regularly in their halls\\".NSW Railway Institute, 2009 A rapid decline of activity at the station, due partly to the completion of the Scheme, resulted in a decrease in freight and passengers, and NSW Railways could not justify repairs required to the track and the old timber trestle bridge over the Numeralla River. The last passenger train left Cooma in November 1988 and the last freight train in 1989. Consequently, the station closed and has now become the most intact railway precinct in NSW demonstrating a century of railway development. The station building has been restored and is the base for the Cooma Monaro Railway. The stationmaster's residence and gatekeeper's cottage are extant but are privately owned.  Description  The station complex comprises a type 4, brick standard roadside station (1889) and platform, a weatherboard skillion roof (1912), an out-of-shed ( 1940, and a timber and corrugated iron goods shed. The station yard includes loading banks, weighbridge, weighbridge office and fettlers shed. The locomotive precinct includes the engine shed (1889), engine store, turntable (1902), coal stage (timber slabs), water column (cast iron with hose attachment), water tank (2000), original water tank site, and ash pits (4 pits, bricks and concrete). The heritage listing also includes the District Locomotive Engineer's (DLE's) Office (1950), the Barracks & Laundry ( 1940) and the Railway Institute Hall & Tennis Courts ( 1958), and the diesel depot, consisting of two small timber sheds with corrugated iron roofs and diesel pipework. The signals and signal gantries ( 1950s), fuel unloading points including pipework and stands, signs (entrance sign, nameboards, platform signs, warning signs, heritage signs), slab (retaining and crossover), platform benches (3 timber and cast iron railway benches) and the station landscape are also heritage-listed. ;Station building (1889) The station building is a standard roadside design, symmetrically planned with awning supported on cast iron posts and decorative brackets. The brick building comprises seven main rooms, toilet skillion, entrance vestibule with verandahs and platform with awning. The roof is gabled and clad with painted corrugated iron and features a central transverse gable. The gables display fretwork and finials and rendered walls have masonry detailing. The building, erected in 1888, has undergone a series of modifications but still displays its Railway Gothic architectural style with many original elements and decorative features in situ. Major modifications were undertaken during the 1920s and the 1960s, the latter owing to increased activity during construction of the Snowy Scheme. The original side pavilions have been replaced by later extensions. At one end new toilets were provided on a larger scale than previously along with additional rooms for luggage and waiting. The building is located on a brick and concrete platform. ;Signal box (1912) The signal box was erected on the platform in 1912 and is a small scalloped weatherboard building with a corrugated iron pitched gable roof. An extension was built in 1955 on the western side to house relays and batteries for track circuits and the electric staff. ;Out-of-shed ( 1940) The small building, which is presently used as a store, is known as the out-of-shed. It was relocated to the platform prior to 1949 and is thought to have been originally a waiting room at a small unattended station. The section at the rear was constructed to house batteries and electrical equipment at the time the signals were electrified. The building has a brick footing, timber skirting, scalloped weatherboard walls, and timber sliding door. ;Goods shed and yard (1889) Cooma railway yards, 2013 The goods shed is made up of four separate sections constructed over 100 years. The earliest part is the central section, dating to 1889. It has brick pier footings, vertical tongue and groove dado and corrugated iron walls, a corrugated iron roof, and a platform and loading stage with timber sleepers running north south. Newer sections of the shed include a 3-room and toilet addition with brick piers, weatherboard walls, and corrugated iron roof cladding, as well as Colorbond clad extension with a platform and loading stage. A suspended concrete platform loading dock has also been added, with Colorbond cladding and a corrugated iron roof. Other important components of the goods yard are the metal weighbridge, weatherboard weighbridge office, wool and cattle loading ramps dating to 1889, consisting of concrete banks with railway line edges and gravel floors, and a corrugated iron fettlers' shed. ;Locomotive precinct (1889) The main element of the locomotive precinct is the straight type engine shed but also included is the store, turntable, coal stage, water column, water tank, ash pits and other infrastructure necessary to service and maintain rolling stock. The engine shed has 1889 English bond brickwork footings. The walls are made of vertical corrugated galvanised iron, with some panels on the east facade made of clear corrugated perspex. The roof is clad in corrugated iron. The doors and windows date to 1997 and 1998 respectively. The engine store has concrete footings, scalloped weatherboard walls, timber doors and window frames, and a corrugated iron roof. The turntable is 60 ft in length with timber and steel platform set on a concrete pit directly connected to the engine shed and yard. ;District Locomotive Engineer's (DLE's) Office (1950) The DLE's office is a single storey face brick building, constructed in an L shape, with a corrugated galvanised iron gable roof, and timber doors, window frames, and fascias. It was built in 1950 to provide an office for the DLE and amenities for those working in the engine shed, such as a meal room, locker room, washrooms and so on. The building has now been converted to a residence with little alteration to the floor plan. ;Barracks (1941) The building initially consisted of six bedrooms to sleep 12 men, with bathroom facilities, a kitchen and dining room. There is also a separate laundry. Some years later, between 1952-1955, an extension of four more bedrooms was attached. The interior of the building is relatively intact however four of the original bedrooms have been combined to form a meeting room. The barracks building has brick footings and walls, corrugated asbestos roof cladding, with timber post verandahs to the east and west, and a brick chimney. ;Railway Institute and tennis courts (1958) The railway institute hall is a small, single storey building of two rooms, comprising a hall and annex, erected . The tennis court was built around the same time. The institute hall has exposed brick piers, asbestos cement sheet cladding, and a corrugated iron roof. The tennis courts consist of two gravel courts with wire netting fence, a slab retaining wall, and timber benches. ;Landscape Photos from the 1920s show that there were no exotic plantings in the old railway yard. Since then gardening at railway stations has become a tradition with such features as rose species in forecourts, approaches lined with trees and plants in tubs on platforms. This trend is demonstrated at Cooma. The majority of the yard is covered with native grasses, which are kept slashed and quite a few areas are infested with noxious weeds. Rubbish and extraneous items have built up around the engine shed, goods shed in the ash pits and the DLE's office garden.  Condition  The station was reported to generally be in good condition as at 11 November 2009. The station group including the station buildings, platforms and related structures have a high level of integrity. The Cooma Railway Station precinct retains its ability to demonstrate 100 years of rail which sets it apart from other railway sites in NSW. All necessary elements for operating the railway are in place and of the past 61 major fixed items which were previously at the railway yard, 55 are still found.  Heritage listing  Cooma Railway Station Group is of state significance for its role in the development of Cooma, the Monaro and the Snowy Scheme and for its provision of services for freight and passengers for over a century. The increasing and decreasing importance of rail as a mode of transport can be interpreted through the evolution of the site. It was built under the support of Engineer-in-Chief John Whitton whose name is synonymous with the expansion of railways throughout New South Wales. The station building, which is one of a group of similar buildings constructed for the Southern Railway, displays his design skills and the inclusion of some refined architectural elements results in this building being more impressive than others of its size. The siting of the precinct on a hill on the outskirts of Cooma results in it being one of the town's landmarks. The arrival of the railway in Cooma changed the lives of the district's inhabitants and the railway was the venue for many important social events and occasions of arrivals and departures particularly for the two world wars. Those working on the Snowy Scheme depended on the railway and during construction the railways were one the largest employers in the region. Cooma's group of railway buildings and infrastructure illustrate designs and materials from a number of eras and make an important contribution to understanding railway practices and life, and the railway's philosophy of relocation and reuse. There are a number of rare items at the site but the two most significant are the signalling equipment, the most complete of its kind in Australia, and the straight type engine shed, being only one of four extant and considered to be the most intact example. Cooma railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Extension of the railway line from Goulburn to Cooma, and finally to Bombala, had a major effect on the development of the Monaro. It enabled Cooma to become the commercial centre of the region and the district's agricultural economy to flourish. The capacity of the station was an important factor in selection of the town as the headquarters for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority (SMHEA). Owing to its operation over 100 years and expansion of facilities to suit the needs of the community the precinct demonstrates growth phases over a century. There are many extant items which date from 1889, the year of opening, as well as representative examples from all eras of its 100 years operation. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Cooma railway was built during the time that John Whitton was Engineer-in-Chief of the NSW Railways 1856 to 1890. It was through Whitton's influence and persistence that nearly 3,500 km of track were laid throughout the state and cheap alternatives, such as narrow gauge rail tracks, did not eventuate. The station building is a good representative example of Whitton's architectural skills. The site has aesthetic significance as a railway precinct that retains several original items that demonstrate railway design in the 1880s. The 1887 station building is a fine example of a Victorian first class roadside station building with fabric and fine detailing typical of the period The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. John Whitton was trained as an architect as well as an engineer and the station buildings erected during his tenure of Engineer-in-Chief, such as Cooma, exhibit interesting Victorian architectural detailing which illustrate his design skills. The station building at Cooma demonstrates interesting architectural features peculiar to Victorian railway buildings as well as the evolution of requirements over ten decades. Along with the other buildings, facilities and equipment the complex presents a pleasing example of a railway station landscape. The siting of the precinct results in it being a landmark in town. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. For most of the 100 years that trains operated between Queanbeyan and Cooma agricultural producers depended on the railway to get their produce to market, people were able to travel easily, goods arriving in Cooma were cheaper and more diverse and it enabled the town and district to develop. The railway was essential for Cooma to become the SMHEA headquarters which completely changed the social fabric of the town. Memorable arrivals and departures at the station have been significant events in local people's lives. The railway was a major employer in Cooma and many people spent all their working lives there. The Institute Building is significant as the social hub of the Cooma railway precinct during its expansion in the 1950s. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Cooma railway station is considered to be the most complete rail precinct in NSW demonstrating 100 years of rail development from steam engines to diesel locomotives and with possibly the most complete pre 1960 type railway signalling equipment in Australia. Many items and areas demonstrate the railway's philosophies of relocation and reuse, railway customs and practices and the railway lifestyle. The development and fluctuations of a rural railway station are illustrated at Cooma. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Cooma railway precinct is considered to be the only site in NSW which so completely illustrates the development of rail from steam to diesel. At the station 90% of the items which were historically present are in place. The completeness and functionality of the signalling equipment, which is the only arrangement of its type in Australia, and the straight type locomotive shed, one of only four extant in NSW, are particularly rare features. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The precinct is a good representation of a rural railway station which developed over a 100-year period. Items at the site represent railway customs, functions, architectural designs, work practices and requirements for passengers and freight as well as the railway's attitude to its employees. The station building is a good example of one of John Whitton's larger station buildings with many original features intact. The barracks, although altered, is representative of standard railway accommodation built for crew workers during the mid 20th Century.

She is also the executive editor at Penthouse, as well as the music editor for BriteLite magazine. In 2015, Anna Wintour let Barber-Way model Yves Saint Laurent in Vogues September issue, shot by David Sims. In 2016, Barber-Way performed a cover of \\"Used to Love Her\\" by Guns N' Roses. Personal life Barber-Way is married to singer Austin Barber of American rock band Saviours, and they live in the suburbs of Los Angeles, California with their son. In prior albums with White Lung, Barber-Way incorporated songs about her personal experience with body dysmorphia and addiction.

Langworthy (born February 27, 1981) is an American politician serving as chair of the New York State Republican Committee. Langworthy was named chair of the Committee in July 2019 after having chaired the Erie County, New York Republican Committee since 2010. Early life Langworthy was born in Jamestown, New York, a small city south of Buffalo. He attended the Pine Valley Central School in his hometown of South Dayton and graduated in 1999. After grade school, he went on to attend Niagara University, where he established the university's branch of the College Republicans. He graduated from Niagara with a bachelor's degree in political science and served as chairman of the New York College Republicans. Political career Early career After interning at Gov. George Pataki's office and running a congressional campaign in 2002, Langworthy became a staffer for Congressman Thomas M. Reynolds. Later, he managed Reynolds' successful re-election campaigns in 2004 and 2006. While working for Congressman Reynolds, he met his wife, Erin, who also worked on the congressman's staff. Langworthy later managed the successful 2008 campaign of Rep. Chris Lee; he served as Lee's district office director until May 2010. Langworthy is the founder and president of a polling firm, Liberty Opinion Research. Erie County Republican Committee Erie County Republican Committee Chair James P. Domagalski resigned his chairmanship in 2010 to run for the New York State Senate. An early frontrunner for the county chairship, Langworthy made himself as visible as possible on the county and state Republican scenes. In a special election held to fill the vacant chairmanship, Langworthy won unanimously, becoming the youngest chairman of either political party in Erie County's history. Langworthy was the only Republican county chairman to endorse Carl Paladino in the Republican gubernatorial primary in 2010; he emerged as a political powerhouse when Paladino won the primary. Paladino's primary upset, together with the Republicans' successful effort to take control of the Erie County Legislature, led Buffalo News chief political columnist Bob McCarthy to call Langworthy the \\"GOP's Young Elder\\". In 2016, President-elect Donald Trump announced that Langworthy would serve on the executive committee of his transition team. Langworthy had been a vocal supporter of Trump's presidential campaign. In September 2019, it was announced that Langworthy would be succeeded as Erie County chairman by Boston, New York Republican chairman Karl J. Simmeth Jr. New York State Republican Committee In 2018, Langworthy began campaigning for the chairmanship of the New York State Republican Committee against incumbent state chairman Ed Cox. On May 20, 2019, after Monroe County Republican Chair Bill Reilich announced his support for Langworthy, Cox announced that he was withdrawing his candidacy for a new term as chairman; the Democrat and Chronicle reported that Langworthy was \\"poised to become\\" the next chair of the Republican Committee. On July 1, 2019, Langworthy was formally named Chair of the New York State Republican Committee. Personal life Langworthy's wife, Erin Baker Langworthy, ran unsuccessfully for Amherst, New York Town Board in 2017. She serves as the finance chairwoman at the Erie County Republican Committee.

During a career that has spanned over 40 years, John Carpenter has worked on projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of the films were produced after he left production. 1970s Meltdown * In a 1998 interview with Carpenter, he said: ‚ÄúWell, here‚Äôs the story. Back in 1977 I was a writer, and took an assignment called the ‚ÄúPrometheus Crisis‚Äù ‚Äì about a nuclear plant meltdown. It's kind of Halloween in a nuclear power plant. It's been 20 years since they were trying to set it up ‚Äì and at one point it was supposed to go with Dolph Lundgren. But I haven't heard anything about it. I don't have any attachment to it anymore, but we'll see what happens with it.‚Äù After several attempts, the project was about to start filming in June 1994 under the helm of director John Dahl with Dolph Lundgren in the lead role, but the production was shutdown because of legal disputes regarding the US distribution rights claimed by several companies. Another attempt was announced in 1997 with actor Casper Van Dien but the ill-fated project still remains unproduced. 1980s Firestarter * In 1981, during filming of The Thing, Universal Pictures offered him the chance to direct Firestarter, based on the novel by Stephen King. Carpenter respectively hired Bill Lancaster and Bill Phillips to adapt the novel into different versions of the screenplay. Carpenter had intended Richard Dreyfuss as Andy McGee, but when The Thing was a financial disappointment, Universal replaced Carpenter with Mark L. Lester, and the script was written by Stanley Mann. The Philadelphia Experiment * In 1982, Carpenter was working on the screenplay for the 1984 film The Philadelphia Experiment but struggled to complete the third act. In the end, his screenplay was completely rewritten by Wallace C. Bennett, with his official credit on the film being an executive producer. The Ninja * Originally in the 1980s, the rights to make a film adaptation of The Ninja were bought by producers Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown for 20th Century Fox to produce. Official website FAQ Irvin Kershner was hired to direct, using a screenplay written by W.D. Richter, which followed the novel very closely. Tom Cole was hired to write a draft, while Kershner himself also wrote a draft. Kershner turned out to be the wrong man for the job and was replaced by John Carpenter as new director. Carpenter co-wrote a second draft with Tommy Lee Wallace in 1983, but it turned out not filmable. A frustrating year after being hired, Carpenter left for not being able to produce a workable draft. By around this time, Joe Wizan, who had become the new head of Fox, put The Ninja and other projects that were given the greenlight into turnaround.‚ÄúTHE NINJA‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúTHE NINJA: The Movie‚Äù This caused Zanuck and Brown to quit Fox and start working for Warner Brothers.Zanuck/Brown leaving Fox Santa Claus: The Movie * In 1984, Carpenter was one of many directors attached to helm Santa Claus: The Movie, intending to cast Brian Dennehy or Wilford Brimley as the titular character. However, Carpenter hated the screenplay and pushed to write his own draft, additionally wanting to compose the film's musical score. The studio wasn't interested in Carpenter doing anything besides directing and he eventually left the project over creative differences. Jeannot Szwarc would go on to direct the final project with David Huddleston playing Santa Claus. Top Gun * In 1985, Carpenter was offered a chance to direct Top Gun, but quickly turned it down. He did not see it being much of a success at all and thought that fighting the Russians in the third act would not do any favors for already hostile international relations. Even in recent years, he has noted that there was nothing he could think of that he could have done with that movie; it just was not for him. Tony Scott was eventually chosen to direct the film. The Golden Child * In 1986, Carpenter was offered the chance to direct The Golden Child, but he preferred the similar script for Big Trouble in Little China, starring Kurt Russell; Michael Ritchie ended up directing the film. \\"The films have a similar theme in that they both explore Chinese legend and magic, but they develop in different ways,\\" Carpenter said. \\"Golden Child is a very fine script. It has its problems, but it also has one big plus‚ÄîEddie Murphy. It will be hard to pull off that script. But if they do, it could be a wonderful movie!\\" Armed and Dangerous * In an August 1986 interview, John Candy revealed that Carpenter was initially attached to direct the film Armed and Dangerous, but was eventually replaced by Mark L. Lester. Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers * Cannon Films, who had just finished 1986's release of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, approached Carpenter to write and direct Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers. Debra Hill planned to produce the film, while Carpenter teamed up with Dennis Etchison who, under the pseudonym Jack Martin, had written novelizations of both Halloween II (1981) and Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982) to write a script to Halloween 4. Originally, Joe Dante was Carpenter's choice for director on the project itself. However, producer Moustapha Akkad rejected the Etchison script, calling it \\"too cerebral\\" and insisting that any new Halloween sequel must feature Michael Myers as a flesh and blood killer.An AMC special \\"Backdraft\\", a show about the behind the scenes info on the whole Halloween series clarified all of this information. In an interview, Etchison explained how he received the phone call informing him of the rejection of his script. Etchison said, \\"I received a call from Debra Hill and she said, 'Dennis, I just wanted you to know that John and I have sold our interest in the title 'Halloween' and unfortunately, your script was not part of the deal.\\" Carpenter and Hill had signed all of their rights away to Akkad, who gained ownership. Akkad said, \\"I just went back to the basics of Halloween on Halloween 4 and it was the most successful.\\" As Carpenter refused to continue his involvement with the series, a new director was sought out. Dwight H. Little, a native of Ohio, replaced Carpenter. Little had previously directed episodes for Freddy's Nightmares and the film Bloodstone. Fatal Attraction * Carpenter was offered a chance to direct the 1987 film Fatal Attraction, but he just was not interested in it at all. He has famously mentioned turning this down by saying that he read the script and basically told them that he had already seen this movie when it was called Play Misty for Me, thinking the movie was going to tank at the box office. Adrian Lyne ended up directing the film. Shadow Company * After finishing the 1988 film They Live, Carpenter was going to direct an action horror film called Shadow Company. Written by Shane Black (who was to produce it) and Fred Dekker, the project was to be executive produced by Walter Hill (who also co- wrote some of the script) with Kurt Russell in the main role. The script was about a group of US Special Forces soldiers who died during the Vietnam War. Years later, after their bodies are brought back, the soldiers, who were members of an Army project involving dark experiments, rise up from their graves, raid the armory from a nearby base, and attack the town in which they were buried, killing everyone during Christmas night. Due to problems in pre- production, the movie was never made, although the original 1988 script has gained a cult following from fans of Carpenter, Black and Dekker. The Exorcist III * In 1989, Carpenter was offered The Exorcist III, and met with writer William Peter Blatty (who also authored the novel on which it was based, Legion) during the course of a week. However, the two disagreed about the film's climax and Carpenter refused the project. Blatty directed the film himself a year later. Carpenter said that although they argued about the ending, they had a mutual respect and talked about an interest they shared: quantum physics.Gilles Boulenger. John Carpenter: Prince of Darkness. Page 216The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows (Omnibus Press, 1999) Pincushion * In 1989, Carpenter was going to direct Pincushion, a post-apocalyptic odyssey from rookie writer John Raffo (which producer Scott Rudin purchased during the writers' strike for $500,000). The film's relatively modest budget escalated towards $20 million, when Cher was cast in the lead role of the driver in post-plague America who must deliver a life-saving serum to save Salt Lake City. The film went undeveloped, leading to copies of the script being sold online. 1990s Creature from the Black Lagoon * In 1992, Carpenter was developing the remake of Creature from the Black Lagoon at Universal. He originally hired Bill Phillips to write the script while Rick Baker was hired to create the 3D model of the Creature, but the project never got green-lit. Recent development of another remake surfaced when Universal's Dark Universe was announced, but may have been shelved indefinitely due to the critical and financial failure of their first installment. Tombstone * In the early 1990s, Carpenter was going to direct the 1993 western film Tombstone. In the end, the film was directed by George P. Cosmatos and stars frequent Carpenter collaborator Kurt Russell. Escape from Mars * In 1996, the script to Ghosts of Mars originally started off as a potential Snake Plissken sequel.https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3403507/15th-anniversary- ghosts-of-mars/https://filmschoolrejects.com/john-carpenter-ghosts-of-mars- commentary/ Entitled Escape from Mars, the story would have been largely much the same; however, after Escape from L.A. failed to make much money at the box office, the studio did not wish to make another Plissken movie.https://thegww.com/ghosts-of-mars-a-repurposed-escape-from-sequel-with- quatermass-and-the-pit-story-beats/ Snake Plissken was then changed to \\"Desolation Williams,\\" and the studio also insisted that Ice Cube be given the part. Godzilla * At an early age, Carpenter created many horror short films with 8 mm film, including Gorgo Versus Godzilla due to his love of the 1954 classic Godzilla. Since becoming an influential director, he has always wanted to direct and write the first American Godzilla film. The 1998 and 2014 American films were released without Carpenter's involvement. In 2004, Carpenter appeared in an episode of Animal Planet's Animal Icons titled \\"It Came from Japan\\", where he discussed his love and admiration for the 1954 original Godzilla film. Halloween H20: 20 Years Later * Carpenter was originally in the running to be the director for Halloween H20: 20 Years Later since Jamie Lee Curtis wanted to reunite the cast and for the crew of the original to have active involvement in it. It was believed that Carpenter opted out because he wanted no active part in the sequel; however, this is not the case. Carpenter agreed to direct the film, but his starting fee as director was $10 million. Carpenter rationalized this by believing the hefty fee was compensation for revenue he never received from the original Halloween, a matter that was still a point of contention between Carpenter and Akkad even after 20 years had passed. When Akkad balked at Carpenter's fee, Carpenter left the project. 2000s Vampires (sequel) * In early 2000, after enjoying his time while working on the 1998 film Vampires, John Carpenter showed interest in directing a sequel. Although the studio was interested and decided to move forward with a second film, Carpenter later declined after it was deemed unlikely that a sequel would be given a theatrical release. The film was made as Vampires: Los Muertos in 2002 with frequent Carpenter collaborator Tommy Lee Wallace taking over writer and director duties and Carpenter himself assuming the role of an executive producer. Ghosts of Mars (sequel) * Carpenter's 2001 film Ghosts of Mars was planned to be the first of a potential trilogy, as it ended on a cliffhanger with demons attacking the city. After the film bombed at the box office, plans for sequels were quickly scrapped. The Thing (video game sequel) * When the first game was released, Carpenter endorsed it and had a voice cameo as Dr. Sean Faraday. A sequel went into development after the first game proved a critical and commercial success, but it was cancelled when Computer Artworks went into receivership in October 2003. According to Diarmid Campbell, \\"we had the contract in place to make the sequel with Carpenter and were pretty excited about it. We had a very cool prototype of 'dynamic infection' and some really imaginative thing 'burst-outs'. I particularly liked the one where the person would split in half and their top half would jump to the ceiling and start swinging around like an orangutan with his intestines turned into tentacles.\\" However, the project never developed beyond the proof of concept stage, with Computer Artworks producing some concept art, showing locations and enemies, and two short demo videos, but nothing else. The Thing (miniseries sequel) * In 2005, the Syfy channel planned a four-hour miniseries sequel to The Thing, produced by Carpenter and Frank Darabont and written by David Leslie Johnson. The story follows a Soviet team who recover the corpses of MacReady and Childs, and remnants of the Thing. The story moves forward 23 years, where the Thing escapes in New Mexico, and follows the attempts at containment.

Psychopath (video game and film) * In 2005, Titan Productions, originally owned and operated by Brad Foxhoven and David Wohl, announced a new title in development for next-generation consoles. Psychopath, a first-person action game, was being made in collaboration with Carpenter. Titan had not yet announced a publisher, platform, or release date for the thriller. The only details that Titan has released about the game's story is that it revolves around a former CIA operative who is forced back into duty to stop a serial killer. Titan's aim in the industry was to push projects through multiple forms of media. In conjunction with the game, a film version of Psychopath was also in the works. Carpenter was to direct the film and the game's cutscenes and character design. Zombieland (TV pilot) * In 2006, Carpenter was one of the first to be attached to Zombieland, when it was still envisioned as a TV pilot. He had been tapped to helm the pilot, seemed excited to do it, then faded away from the project when it transitioned into becoming the feature film directed by Ruben Fleischer. Planet Terror (music) * In January 2007, Carpenter was going to write the music for the Robert Rodriguez film Planet Terror. In the end, he decided not to write it, with Rodriguez eventually taking over. Inspiration for his score came from Carpenter, whose music was often played on set. The Haunting in Connecticut * In early 2007, Gold Circle Films was reportedly discussing a directing contract with Carpenter for The Haunting in Connecticut. Although Carpenter was initially interested, the deal quickly fell through due to creative differences. Carpenter did enjoy the film's concept and would later agree to direct The Ward due to its similarities in tone and theme with The Haunting in Connecticut. Darkchylde (film) * In August 2007, Randy Queen, creator of the comic book character Darkchylde, revealed to Newsarama that a movie is in the works. In an interview with Nicholas Yanes from scifipulse.net, Queen was asked and responded to a question about a film/television adaptation of Darkchylde: \\"Yanes: For years now there have been rumors of Darkchylde being turned into an animated series, miniseries for a cable network and movie. Are you able to comment on Darkchylde‚Äôs potential future on in television and film? Any actresses you‚Äôd love to play Ariel? Queen: A movie makes so much sense it‚Äôs ridiculous, and all I can say is that we are working on it. I know that‚Äôs a frustrating answer for fans, but it‚Äôs a frustrating process. It‚Äôs probably best for me not to comment on actresses, so we‚Äôll just all have to wait and see.\\" Test footage from the set of Darkchylde emerged in July 2010 and on October 31, 2010, it was announced Carpenter was to direct. Riot * In November 2008, Carpenter was working on a project called Riot, written by Joe Gazzam.

But when a riot breaks out and the prisoners take him hostage, a lifer played by Nicolas Cage is forced to help the young man out. 2010s F.E.A.R. 3 * In April 2010, Carpenter announced he will join the F.E.A.R. franchise, offering himself as a spokesman and to help direct the cinematics for F.E.A.R. 3.

They Live (remake) * In Fall 2010, there was development on a remake of Carpenter's 1988 film They Live, with him in a producer role. In 2011, Matt Reeves signed on to direct and write the screenplay. Dead Space (film) * In 2013, Carpenter expressed interest in making a Dead Space film, due to his desire for a horror franchise movie that might surpass Resident Evil. Justin Marks would write the script, but adapting the game storyline and the characters made production easy. EA had plans to adapt the Dead Space videogames into a potential film franchise. Sonic the Hedgehog (film) * For many years during his career, Carpenter has been a known supporter of video games as a media and art form and has a particular liking for the Sonic the Hedgehog games, even teasing his interest in being involved in a feature film adaptation. When the 2020 Sonic the Hedgehog film cast and crew were hired, Carpenter was not listed, making his involvement on any Sonic project more unlikely.  Untitled Big Trouble in Little China sequel * In June 2015, The Wrap reported that Dwayne Johnson was developing a remake of Carpenter's 1986 film Big Trouble in Little China to star as Jack Burton and produce with his Seven Bucks Productions partners Dany and Hiram Garcia. Ashley Miller and Zack Stentz were to write the new script. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Johnson expressed interest in having Carpenter involved as a producer in the remake. Carpenter later said, \\"It's very early in the process. I haven't spoken to Dwayne Johnson about any of this... I'm ambivalent about a remake.\\"Calia, Michael (June 11, 2015). \\"John Carpenter Hasn't Talked to Dwayne Johnson about 'Big Trouble in Little China.'\\" Blogs.WSJ.com. Retrieved August 27, 2018.
