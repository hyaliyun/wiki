The game features Sonic the Hedgehog exploring maze-like stages from an isometric perspective. Dr. Robotnik has robbed Sonic of his trademark speed, so Sonic walks slowly but can roll into a ball and dash across the stages. Critics thought the game was a unique addition to the Sonic library but flawed by convoluted controls and repetitive gameplay. It has received generally negative reviews in retrospect and is considered one of the worst Sonic games ever. Sonic Labyrinth was rereleased on Sonic Adventure DX and on Sonic Mega Collection Plus, as well as the Nintendo 3DS in 2012. ==Gameplay== Sonic exploring a stage Sonic Labyrinth is an action and puzzle game with pinball elements. It is presented in an isometric perspective, and has been compared to Marble Madness. Series villain Dr. Robotnik has tricked Sonic the Hedgehog into wearing special shoes designed to rob him of his speed, so Sonic must collect the Chaos Emeralds to release the shoes from his feet. The player controls Sonic, navigating him through maze-like stages filled with enemies and obstacles that hinder his path. Sonic walks uncharacteristically slow, but can roll into a ball and dash across the levels to take out enemies and avoid danger. This spin dash move can be charged for extra speed and damage. Sonic must collect three keys in each stage and bring them to the goal to advance to the next level. Sometimes the keys may be hidden within enemies. The game has four zones, each containing three stages. After each set of three stages, there is a bonus round of collecting rings and a boss battle. Collecting 100 rings in the bonus round will net the player an extra life. After finishing the game, a time attack mode is unlocked. ==Development and release== Sonic Labyrinth was developed by Minato Giken, and published by Sega. It was released in Japan on 17 November 1995, in North America that November, and in Europe around October or November. The game was included in Sonic Adventure DX (2003) as an unlockable bonus, and in the compilation Sonic Mega Collection Plus (2004). It was rereleased for the Nintendo 3DS on the Japanese eShop digital distribution platform on 16 May 2012. It was later released in Europe on 5 October 2012, and in North America on 17 June 2013. The North American release came as part of a campaign by Nintendo to release 8-bit games on the 3DS eShop following a draught of releases on the distribution service. The game does not take advantage of the system's 3D stereoscopic functionality. ==Reception== Critical reception to Sonic Labyrinth was mixed. Multiple reviewers wrote about difficulties controlling Sonic as he bounced wildly around the levels. Mean Machines Sega wrote that \\"you can get through each level with a bit of practise but you're left wondering how you did it.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) did not like the game's isometric perspective, thinking it contributed to problems directing Sonic around. GamePro wrote that small screen made it occasionally difficult to see what was occurring. They did like the graphics however, as did EGM and Mean Machines Sega, the latter which thought they echoed the graphics of SegaSonic the Hedgehog (1993). Reflecting their positive thoughts, Mega Fun thought Sonic Labyrinth featured innovative gameplay. GamePro and Famitsu both compared the game to Marble Madness. Sega Magazin thought the game was challenging with sophisticated level design. GamePro believed it was the most interesting of the recent Sonic additions to the Game Gear library. One reviewer at Mean Machines Sega thought it was a good puzzle game to play in short segments, and may be worth the time for fans of Sonic games, pinball, or puzzles. However another critic from the same magazine thought the game was frustrating and repetitive. EGM also thought the game became repetitious after a few levels and would be boring for more experienced players, although Sonic fans may enjoy it. They concluded their thoughts writing: \\"This title overall tried to mix the standard side-scrolling Sonic game with a worthless pinball title and failed. In turn, this one just comes up short in both playability and enjoyment, causing boredom after the first few stages.\\" Retrospectively, reception has been negative and is frequently described as one of the worst Sonic games. In a retrospective review, Nintendo Life gave the game a \\"poor\\" 4 out of 10 score. They criticized the controls and illogical level design, and the start-stop nature of the gameplay. They also wrote about Sonic's lack of speed when walking on foot, which they thought was baffling for a Sonic game. USgamer called it \\"a poor man's version of Marble Madness, taking the worst of that game and the worst of Sonic and cramming it into one title. Absolutely dire.\\" Nintendo World Report called it \\"a demented version of Sonic 3D Blast\\", drawing similarities through its isometric style. Official Nintendo Magazine called it \\"a dreadful game with an identity crisis\\" and \\"one of the worst Sonic games ever\\". ==Notes== ==References== Category:1995 video games Category:Minato Giken games Category:Platform games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Sega video games Category:Sega Game Gear games Category:Sonic the Hedgehog video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games for Nintendo 3DS Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Sonic Labyrinth"},{"id":"1268494","text":"Arroz a la cubana () (Cuban-style rice) or arroz cubano is a dish mostly eaten in Cuba.

It combines neuroscience with phenomenology in order to study experience, mind, and consciousness with an emphasis on the embodied condition of the human mind.Gallagher, S. 2009. Neurophenomenology. In T. Bayne, A. Cleeremans and P. Wilken (eds.), Oxford Companion to Consciousness (470-472). Oxford: Oxford University Press. The field is very much linked to fields such as neuropsychology, neuroanthropology and behavioral neuroscience (also known as biopsychology) and the study of phenomenology in psychology. ==Overview== The label was coined by C. Laughlin, J. McManus and E. d'Aquili in 1990. However, the term was appropriated and given a distinctive understanding by the cognitive neuroscientist Francisco Varela in the mid-1990s,Varela, F. 1996. Neurophenomenology: A methodological remedy for the hard problem. Journal of Consciousness Studies 3: 330-49. whose work has inspired many philosophers and neuroscientists to continue with this new direction of research. Phenomenology is a philosophical method of inquiry of everyday experience. The focus in phenomenology is on the examination of different phenomena (from Greek, phainomenon, \\"that which shows itself\\") as they appear to consciousness, i.e. in a first-person perspective. Thus, phenomenology is a discipline particularly useful to understand how is it that appearances present themselves to us, and how is it that we attribute meaning to them.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: PhenomenologyGallagher, S. and Zahavi, D. 2008. The Phenomenological Mind. London: Routledge, Chapter 2. Neuroscience is the scientific study of the brain, and deals with the third- person aspects of consciousness. Some scientists studying consciousness believe that the exclusive utilization of either first- or third-person methods will not provide answers to the difficult questions of consciousness. Historically, Edmund Husserl is regarded as the philosopher whose work made phenomenology a coherent philosophical discipline with a concrete methodology in the study of consciousness, namely the epoche. Husserl, who was a former student of Franz Brentano, thought that in the study of mind it was extremely important to acknowledge that consciousness is characterized by intentionality, a concept often explained as \\"aboutness\\"; consciousness is always consciousness of something. A particular emphasis on the phenomenology of embodiment was developed by philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty in the mid-20th century. Naturally, phenomenology and neuroscience find a convergence of common interests. However, primarily because of ontological disagreements between phenomenology and philosophy of mind, the dialogue between these two disciplines is still a very controversial subject. Debate Between D. Chalmers and D. Dennett: The Fantasy of First-Person Science Husserl himself was very critical towards any attempt to \\"naturalizing\\" philosophy, and his phenomenology was founded upon a criticism of empiricism, \\"psychologism\\", and \\"anthropologism\\" as contradictory standpoints in philosophy and logic.Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Edmund Husserl The influential critique of the ontological assumptions of computationalist and representationalist cognitive science, as well as artificial intelligence, made by philosopher Hubert Dreyfus has marked new directions for integration of neurosciences with an embodied ontology. The work of Dreyfus has influenced cognitive scientists and neuroscientists to study phenomenology and embodied cognitive science and/or enactivism. One such case is neuroscientist Walter Freeman, whose neurodynamical analysis has a marked Merleau-Pontyian approach. However, recent trends on the matter appear to reject Dreyfus's interpretation of Husserl while at the same time maintaining a high interest in the integration of Husserlian phenomenology into the sciences of mind, as demonstrated by Evan Thompson's recent work.\\"Evan Thompson.

Mitchell, Cynthia Davis (2019). Encyclopedia of the Black Arts Movement. p. 323. Rowman & Littlefield by enslaved persons of African descent, were organized groups of armed white men who monitored and enforced discipline upon black slaves in the antebellum U.S. southern states. The slave patrols' function was to police enslaved persons, especially those who escaped or were viewed as defiant. They also formed river patrols to prevent escape by boat. Slave patrols were first established in South Carolina in 1704, and the idea spread throughout the colonies. ==Formation of slave patrols== Slave patrols first began in South Carolina in 1704 and spread throughout the thirteen colonies, lasting well beyond the American Revolution. As the population of enslaved black people boomed, especially with the invention of the cotton gin, so did the fear of resistance and uprisings by the enslaved. The development of slave patrols began when other means of slave control failed to quell enslaved people's resistance. Their biggest concern were the enslaved being held against their will on the plantations since that is where enslaved populations were highest. Initially, incentives were offered to whites such as tobacco and money to urge whites to be more vigilant in the capture of runaway slaves. When this approach failed, slave patrols were formally established. Laws were put into place to regulate the activities of both blacks and whites. Black persons were subjected to questioning, searches, and other harassment. Slaves who were encountered without passes from their white \\"master\\" were expected to be returned to their owners, as stated in the slave code. Punishment for runaway slaves, such as whippings and beatings, could be expected. More than floggings and beatings, however, enslaved people feared the threat of being placed on the auction block and being separated from their families. If caught by patrols and returned to their masters, being placed on the auction block was an option for masters who no longer wanted to deal with their \\"non-compliant\\" slaves.Douglass, Frederick. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass. Dover Publications, 1995. Print. During these times, slaves were often neglected and mistreated despite having permission to travel. ==State militias as patrollers== ‚ÄúSlave patrols, the militias of the Second Amendment‚Äù. The armed white men inspect the enslaved blacks. Slave owners feared gatherings held by enslaved people would allow them to trade or steal goods, and had the potential for organizing a revolt or rebellion. South Carolina and Virginia selected patrols from state militias. State militia groups were also organized from among the cadets of the Southern military academies, of The Citadel and the Virginia Military Institute, which were founded to provide a military command structure and discipline within the slave patrols and to detect, encounter, and crush any organized slave meetings that might lead to revolt or rebellion.Loewen, James W. Lies Across America: What Our Historic Sites Get Wrong. The New Press, 2013. Print. ==Slave codes and fugitive slave laws== The Fugitive Slave Laws helped enforce the necessity for slave patrols to abide by the law. Although these laws were initially created to keep tensions low between the north and the south, it caused the physical formation of slave patrols. During the Civil War, the theory of Contraband prevented the return of Southern slaves who reached Union-held territory. This helped limit the role of slave patrols/catchers and changed the war. Another form of help for slaves was the Underground Railroad, which aided slaves in their escape to Northern states. Outside of the Underground Railroad, enslaved black people went further south to ensure their freedom. Black people also formed their own organized networks and means of escape from slavery to Florida, where Black people negotiated with Native Americans and the Spanish government, and were able to live self-determined and free lives. Formerly enslaved people formed their own towns, military, and merged with the Florida population as Seminoles. Formerly imprisoned Europeans, Irish immigrants, and other former institutionalized Europeans were immigrated through race-based policies to found the state of Georgia. They were partially recruited to form a buffer state to stop enslaved Black people from escaping from the Carolinas, Georgia, and Virginia to Florida. Slave patrols in Georgia were formed for this purpose. Free Black cities and armed and trained black militaries in Florida were a direct challenge to white dominance and profits in slave-owning states. The concept of self-determined freedom was also a direct challenge to the concept that whites should rule and to the institution of slavery. Slave patrols and plantation police were organized by whites as legal and extra-legal means to stop this from occurring. The use and physical formation of slave patrols came to its end in 1865 when the Civil War ended. This end, however, is linked to post-Civil War groups such as the Ku Klux Klan, which continued to terrorize and threaten the black community. In South Carolina, colonists began to write laws that constricted slaves long before slave patrols were alive and well. Laws implemented set in motion curfews for slaves, strengthening their militia, preventing slaves from bartering goods, and establishing the Charleston town watch. These are examples of some of the laws and ideas that molded what we know as slave codes. Slave codes were different from state to state. Slave masters negotiated slave codes with their slaves. ==Patrollers' duties== Slave patrollers had their own characteristics, duties, and benefits, apart from slave owners and overseers. Patrollers were often equipped with guns and whips and would exert force in order to bring slaves back to their owners. At times, blacks developed many methods of challenging slave patrolling, occasionally fighting back violently. The American Civil War developed more opportunities for resistance against slave patrols and made it easier for enslaved people to escape. Slave patrol duties started as breaking up slave meetings. These slave meetings occurred on holidays, in which they would plan revolts and uprisings. Eventually, slave patrols expanded to be year-round, not just on holidays. Slowly, new duties and rights of patrollers became permitted, including: \\"apprehending runaways, monitoring the rigid pass requirements for blacks traversing the countryside, breaking up large gatherings and assemblies of blacks, visiting and searching slave quarters randomly, inflicting impromptu punishments, and as occasion arose, suppressing insurrections.\\" Slave patrols consisted mostly of white citizens. Most people in slave patrols came from working and middle-class conditions. In some southern states, the militia and army served as slave patrols. In other southern states, slave patrols came about from colonial or state government legislation. Slave patrols typically rode on horseback in groups of four or five, sometimes even in family groups. They often worked sun-up to sun-down and varied their times and locations of patrol, to lower the chances of slaves escaping. They used no special equipment. Their chief tools, instead, were whips and intimidation. Some states, such as South Carolina, required every white man, under consequence of forty shillings, to arrest and chastise any slave found away from their home without proper verification. After slaves were arrested and chastised, they were returned to their masters. In some instances, white men encouraged slaves to escape for the sake of being rewarded after the slave had been caught and returned to their master. In some areas, killing a slave was not considered a crime by the courts or community. Slave patrollers were compensated in several ways, including exemption from public, county, and parish taxes and fees during their term of service. In addition, some patrollers were paid additional sums with surplus money. Also, regardless of the power patrollers held, they had limitations. For example, although whippings and beatings were permitted, a deterrent also existed. This was the fact that, if whipped or beaten too severely, the slave was then of no use to their masters as laborers the next day. As a consequence, overly-brutal patrollers could expect revenge from slave owners.Bellesiles, Michael. Lethal Imagination: Violence and Brutality in American History. NYU Press; Edition Unstated edition (March 1, 1999). Print. ==Diminishing use of slave patrols== ===American Civil War=== The Civil War, which lasted four years, directly threatened the very existence of slavery and, in turn, slave patrols. The first year after the Civil War began, slave patrols increased. Whites were expecting slave revolts, which inspired whites to appoint more patrols. As the war dragged on, more and more white men were being called upon to serve in the Confederate army. White men who would have served in slave patrols had they remained in their communities, went to serve in the Confederate army. Some young men who were turned away by the army, mostly for medical reasons, ended up taking places within the slave patrols. As slave owners entered the Confederate army, some slaves lost the shield they once had to protect them from the harsh and brutal beatings. After the Emancipation Proclamation, the increasing number of white men being called to the militias of the South in 1862 and 1863 resulted in many slave patrols simply not having enough men to be as active as they once were. As the Union army moved into local areas and communities, the likelihood that enslaved people that could flee to the areas controlled by the Union increased. Enslaved people who were considered obedient started to disappear in the night, running toward the Union army to emancipate themselves. ===Reconstruction=== With the war lost, Southern whites' fears of African Americans increased in 1865 due to Reconstruction governments that were perceived as oppressive to the South. Even though slavery and patrols were legally ended, the patrol system still survived. Almost immediately in the aftermath of the war, informal patrols sprang into action. Later, city and rural police squads, along with the help of Union army officers, revived patrolling practices among free men. During the post-Civil War Reconstruction period of 1865‚Äì1877, old-style patrol methods resurfaced and were enforced by postwar Southern police officers and also by organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan. ==See also== *Reverse Underground Railroad *Slave catcher *Underground Railroad *Law enforcement in the United States ==References== ==Further reading== * *Time Warner Unchained Memories: Readings From the Slave Narratives Category:Slavery in the United States ","title":"Slave patrol"},{"id":"1268506","text":"Japan at the Last Glacial Maximum in the Late Pleistocene about 20,000 years ago {  style=\\"background:darkorange; width:30px;\\"   ‚Äì regions above sea level -  style=\\"background:white; width:30px;\\"   (white color) ‚Äì unvegetated -  acfefc; width:30px;\\"   ‚Äì sea } black outline indicates present-day Japan The is the period of human inhabitation in Japan predating the development of pottery, generally before 10,000 BC. The starting dates commonly given to this period are from around 40,000 BC;Hoshino Iseki Museum, Tochigi Pref. although any date of human presence before 35,000 BC is controversial, with artifacts supporting a pre-35,000 BC human presence on the archipelago being of questionable authenticity.Prehistoric Archaeological Periods in Japan, Charles T. Keally The period extended to the beginning of the Mesolithic J≈çmon period, or around 14,000 BC.[http://www.jomon.or.jp/ebulletin11.html \\"Ancient Jomon of Japan\\", Habu Jinko, Cambridge Press, 2004 The earliest human bones were discovered in the city of Hamamatsu in Shizuoka Prefecture, which were determined by radiocarbon dating to date to around 18,000‚Äì14,000 years ago. ==Archaeology of the Paleolithic period== The study of the Paleolithic period in Japan did not begin until quite recently: the first Paleolithic site was not discovered until 1946, right after the end of World War II. Due to the previous assumption that humans did not live in Japan before the J≈çmon period, excavations usually stopped at the beginning of the J≈çmon stratum (14,000 BC), and were not carried on further. However, since that first Paleolithic find by Tadahiro Aizawa, around 5,000 Paleolithic sites have been discovered, some of them at existing J≈çmon archaeological sites, and some dating to the Pleistocene era. Sites have been discovered from southern Kyushu to northern Hokkaido, but most are small and only stone tools have been preserved due to the high acidity of the Japanese soil. As the Palaeolithic peoples probably occupied the wide coastal shelves exposed by lower sea levels during the Pleistocene, the majority of sites are most likely inundated. The study of the Japanese Paleolithic period is characterized by a high level of stratigraphic information due to the volcanic nature of the archipelago: large eruptions tend to cover the islands with levels of Volcanic ash, which are easily datable and can be found throughout the country as a reference. A very important such layer is the AT (Aira-Tanzawa) pumice, which covered all Japan around 21,000‚Äì22,000 years ago. ===Paleolithic Hoax=== In 2000 the reputation of Japanese archaeology of the Paleolithic was heavily damaged by a scandal, which has become known as the Japanese Paleolithic hoax. The Mainichi Shimbun reported the photos in which Shinichi Fujimura, an archaeologist in Miyagi Prefecture, had been planting artifacts at the Kamitakamori site, where he \\"found\\" the artifacts the next day. He admitted the fabrication in an interview with the newspaper. The Japanese Archaeological Association disaffiliated Fujimura from its members. A special investigation team of the Association revealed that almost all the artifacts which he had found were his fabrication. Since the discovery of the hoax, only a few sites can tentatively date human activity in Japan to 40,000‚Äì50,000 BC, and the first widely accepted date of human presence on the archipelago can be reliably dated circa 35,000 BC. ==Ground stone and polished tools== Mammoth hunt, (Hyogo Prefectural Museum of Archaeology) The Japanese Paleolithic is unique in that it incorporates one of the earliest known sets of ground stone and polished stone tools in the world, although older ground stone tools have been discovered in Australia.\\"Prehistoric Japan, New perspectives on insular East Asia\\", Keiji Imamura, University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, The tools, which have been dated to around 30,000 BC, are a technology associated in the rest of the world with the beginning of the Neolithic around 10,000 BC. It is not known why such tools were created so early in Japan. Because of this originality, the Japanese Paleolithic period in Japan does not exactly match the traditional definition of Paleolithic based on stone technology (chipped stone tools). Japanese Paleolithic tool implements thus display Mesolithic and Neolithic traits as early as 30,000 BC. ==Paleoanthropology== The Paleolithic populations of Japan, as well as the later J≈çmon populations, appear to relate to an ancient Paleo-Asian group which occupied large parts of Asia before the expansion of the populations characteristic of today's people of China, Korea, and Japan. During much of this period, Japan was connected to the Asian continent by land bridges due to lower sea levels. Skeletal characteristics point to many similarities with other aboriginal people of the Asian continent. Dental structures are distinct but generally closer to the Sundadont than to the Sinodont group, which points to an origin among groups in Southeast Asia or the islands south of the mainland. Skull features tend to be stronger, with comparatively recessed eyes. According to ‚ÄúJ≈çmon culture and the peopling of the Japanese archipelago‚Äù by Schmidt and Seguchi, the prehistoric J≈çmon people descended from a paleolithic populations of Siberia (in the area of the Altai Mountains). Other cited scholars point out similarities between the J≈çmon and various paleolithic and Bronze Age Siberians. There were likely multiple migrations into ancient Japan. According to Mitsuru Sakitani the J≈çmon people were an admixture of two distinct ethnic groups: A more ancient group (carriers of Y chromosome D1a) that were present in Japan since more than 30,000 years ago and a more recent group (carriers of Y chromosome C1a) that migrated to Japan about 13,000 years ago.Â¥éË∞∑Ê∫Ä„ÄéDNA„ÉªËÄÉÂè§„ÉªË®ÄË™û„ÅÆÂ≠¶ÈöõÁ†îÁ©∂„ÅåÁ§∫„ÅôÊñ∞„ÉªÊó•Êú¨ÂàóÂ≥∂Âè≤„ÄèÔºàÂãâË™†Âá∫Áâà 2009Âπ¥Ôºâ(in Japanese) Genetic analysis on today's populations is not clear-cut and tends to indicate a fair amount of genetic intermixing between the earliest populations of Japan and later arrivals (Cavalli-Sforza). It is estimated that 20 to 30% of the genetic capital of the Japanese population (Yamato people) today derives from the aboriginal Paleolithic-J≈çmon ancestry, with the remainder coming from later migrations from the continent, especially during the Yayoi period. More recent estimates suggests about 10% J≈çmon ancestry in modern Japanese (Yamato). ==See also== *List of archaeological periods *List of archaeological sites sorted by continent and age *Prehistoric Asia ==References== ==Bibliography== * The History and Geography of Human Genes, Cavalli-Sforza, Princeton University Press, *Ainu:Spirit of a Northern People, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, * Shoh Yamada (2002).

They also wear accessories made of beads and copper wire. The males wear a jacket with simple embroidery during gala festivities and carry flint, tinder, and other paraphernalia for making fire. Both sexes wear coils of red- dyed rattan at the waistline. Like other Mangyan tribes, they also carry betel chew and its ingredients in bamboo containers.. Today only around 2 to 5 people speak the Ratagnon language, which is nearly extinct, out of an ethnic population of 2,000 people. ==See also== *Ratagnon language ==References== Category:Ethnic groups in Mindoro ","title":"Ratagnon people"},{"id":"1268514","text":"Mangyan is the generic name for the eight indigenous groups found on the island of Mindoro, southwest of the island of Luzon, the Philippines, each with its own tribal name, language, and customs. The total population may be around 280,000, but official statistics are difficult to determine under the conditions of remote areas, reclusive tribal groups and some having little if any outside world contact. The ethnic groups of the island, from north to south, are: Iraya, Alangan, Tadyawan, Tawbuid (called Batangan by lowlanders on the west of the island), Buhid, and Hanunoo. An additional group on the south coast is labelled Ratagnon. They appear to be intermarried with lowlanders. The group known on the east of Mindoro as Bangon may be a subgroup of Tawbuid, as they speak the 'western' dialect of that language. They also have a kind of poetry which is called the Ambahan. ==Origins== A Mangyan woman playing a mouth harp The Mangyans were once the only inhabitants of Mindoro. Being coastal dwellers at first, they have moved inland and into the mountains to avoid the influx and influence of foreign settlers such as the Tagalogs, the Spanish and their conquests and religious conversion, and raids by the Moro (they raided Spanish settlements for religious purposes, and to satisfy the demand for slave labor). Today, the Mangyans live secludedly in remote parts of Mindoro but eventually comes down to the lowlands in order to make usual trades. Their sustenance are farming for their own crops, fruits, and hunting. A certain group of Mangyans living in Southern Mindoro call themselves Hanunuo Mangyans, meaning \\"true\\", \\"pure\\" or \\"genuine\\", a term that they use to stress the fact that they are strict in the sense of ancestral preservation of tradition and practices. A ritual of the Iraya Mangyan to prepare land for kaingin (swidden farming) Before the Spaniards arrived in Mindoro, the people traded with the Chinese extensively, with thousands of supporting archaeological evidences found in Puerto Galera and in written Chinese references. A division was created among the people of Mindoro when the Spaniards came. There were the Iraya Mangyans, who isolated themselves from the culture of the Spaniards, and the lowland Christians who submitted themselves to a new belief system. These two groups only interacted for economic matters through trading forest goods from the Mangyan and consumer goods for the lowlanders.Lopez, V. B. (1976). The Mangyans of Mindoro: An ethnohistory (1st ed.). Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.Bawagan, A. B. (2009). Customary Justice System among the Iraya Mangyans of Mindoro. AGHAMTAO: Journal of Ugnayang Pang-Aghamtao, Inc. (UGAT), Volume 17, 16. Despite being grouped as one tribe, Mangyans differ in many ways. In comparison to the technological advance between the two geographical divisions, the Southern tribes are more advanced as seen in their use of weaving, pottery and system of writing. The Northern tribes, on the other hand, are simpler in their way of living. Their language, as in the rest of the Philippines, came from the Austronesian language family. However, even if they are defined as one ethnic group, the tribes used different languages. On the average, they only share 40% of their vocabulary. The tribes have also varied physical and ethnogenetic appearances: Iraya has Veddoid features; Tadyawan are mainly Mongoloid; and the Hanunuo looks like a Proto-Malayan. Another difference between tribes is the date of their arrival in the Philippines. A theory suggests that the Southern tribes were already present by 900 AD while the Northern tribes are believed to have arrived hundreds of years ahead of their Southern peers. The Spanish authorities had documented their existence since their arrival in the 16th century. However, historians suggest that the Mangyans may have been the first Filipinos to trade with the Chinese. Examples of this relationship are seen in the burial caves, as porcelains and other potteries abound. However, not much ethnographic research has been made except for the tribal and linguistic differences that may lead to the indication that the tribes can be treated separately. ==Culture and practices== Handicrafts made by the Iraya people at the Iraya Mangyan Community Village in Talipanan, Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro. They are skilled basket weavers and produce crafts of high quality. Mangyans lived in peaceful societies as compared to the head hunting tribes of North Luzon and the brave defiant warrior tribes of the South. Social scientists theorized that some societies become peaceful because their system of norms and values reward peaceful behavior but disapprove aggressive and impulsive behaviors. Peaceful societies are characterized by egalitarian social organization without status competition between men and without asymmetric relationship between men and women. Another theory posited that populations adapt, therefore, offering a more logical explanation why Mangyans preferred to retreat in the hinterlands. They accept peaceful submissiveness when they encounter lowland settlers, missionaries, traders and government officials. Mangyan are mainly subsistence agriculturalists, planting a variety of sweet potato, upland (dry cultivation) rice, and taro. They also trap small animals and wild pig. Many who live in close contact with lowland Filipinos sell cash crops such as bananas and ginger. Their languages are mutually unintelligible, though they share some vocabulary and use Hanun√≥'o script to write: Tawbuid and Buhid are closely related, and are unusual among Philippine languages in having an phoneme; Tawbuid is divided into eastern and western dialects; Western Tawbuid may be the only Philippine language to have no glottal phonemes, having neither or . Their traditional religious world view is primarily animistic; around 10% have embraced Christianity, both Roman Catholicism and Evangelical Protestantism (The New Testaments have been published in six of the Mangyan languages). ==Indigenous Mangyan religion== The Mangyan have a complex spiritual belief system which includes the following deities: *Mahal na Makaako ‚Äì The Supreme Being who gave life to all human beings merely by gazing at them. *Binayi ‚Äì Owner of a garden where all spirits rest. *Binayo ‚Äì Is a sacred female spirit, caretaker of the rice spirits or the kalag paray. She is married to the spirit Bulungabon. The kalag paray must be appeased, to ensure a bountiful harvest. It is for this reason that specific rituals are conducted in every phase of rice cultivation. Some of these rituals include the panudlak, the rite of the first planting; the rite of rice planting itself; and the rites of harvesting which consist of the magbugkos or binding rice stalks, and the pamag-uhan, which follows the harvest. *Bulungabon ‚Äì The spirit aided by 12 fierce dogs. Erring souls are chased by these dogs and eventually drowned in a cauldron of boiling water. He is Binayo's husband. ==Artifacts== The indigenous Mangyans offer a myriad of culturally rich artifacts that give insight into their culture and trade. The people living in Southern Mindoro during the pre-Hispanic era are exceptional in their weaving, pottery, and system of writing. Their clothing differs between genders. The male generally wears loincloths as covering for the lower body whereas the female would wear a skirt and a shirt for the top. The terms and materials would differ from tribe to tribe, but the exceptional designs would come from the Hanun√≥'os. Their textiles are dyed in indigo blue and has an embroidery design called pakudos at the back and can also be found on their woven bags. Their system of writing, called Surat Mangyan, is a pre-Hispanic syllabic system and is believed to be of Indic origin. It is still practiced today and is still being taught in different Mangyan schools of Oriental Mindoro. The Hanun√≥'os also practice their own traditional poetry called the Ambahan, a rhythmic poetic expression with a meter of seven syllables presented through recitation and chanting or inscribed on bamboo. ==References== ==External links== *Mangyan Heritage Center *The legend of the White Mangyans ‚Äì Olandes *iWitness: Ang Alamat ng Puting Mangyan ‚Äì 29 January 2008 (in Filipino) * Category:Indigenous peoples of the Philippines Category:Ethnic groups in Mindoro ","title":"Mangyan"},{"id":"1268524","text":"Ann Lee Doran (July 28, 1911 - September 19, 2000) was an American character actress, possibly best known as the mother of Jim Stark (James Dean) in Rebel Without a Cause (1955). She was an early member of the Screen Actors Guild and served on the board of the Motion Picture & Television Fund for 30 years. ==Early years== The daughter of Carrie A. Barnett and John R. Doran, her mother was a silent-film actress whose professional name was Rose Allen. Ann Doran was born in Amarillo, Texas, and attended high school in San Bernardino, California. ==Film career== Doran began acting at the age of four. (A 1979 newspaper article said that Doran's debut came when she was 11 years old.) Rarely in a featured role (with the exception of James Dean's dominating mother in Rebel Without a Cause (1955)), Doran appeared in more than 500 motion pictures and 1,000 episodes of television series, such as the American Civil War drama Gray Ghost. Doran worked as a stand-in, then bit player, then incidental supporting player. By 1938, she was under contract to Columbia Pictures, where the company policy was to use the members of its stock company as often as possible. Thus, Doran appears in Columbia's serials (such as The Spider's Web and Flying G-Men), short subjects (including those of The Three Stooges, Charley Chase, Andy Clyde, Harry Langdon and Vera Vague), B features (including the Blondie, Five Little Peppers and Ellery Queen series), and major feature films. She became a favorite of Columbia director Frank Capra and appears in many of his productions. Most of these appearances were supporting roles, although she did play leads in Columbia's Charley Chase comedies from 1938 to 1940 and in one Charles Starrett western feature, the Sam Nelson-directed Rio Grande (1938).Westerns Women: Interviews with 50 Leading Ladies of Movie and Film 0786420286 Boyd Magers, Michael G. Fitzgerald - 2004 \\"Asked about Rio Grande (1938), her starring lead opposite Charles Starrett, Ann matter-of-factly states, \\"It was just another job. Nothing unpleasant happened on it ‚Äî but then nothing pleasant did, either. Charles Starrett was very tall and good looking. We got along just fine.\\" Columbia filmed two boy-and-his-dog stories with juvenile star Ted Donaldson in 1945-46. When the Donaldson films became a full-fledged series (featuring the dog Rusty) in 1947, Doran was cast as Donaldson's mother in the next six films. Her steady, sensible maternal roles led to her being cast as James Dean's mother in Rebel Without a Cause. Virginia Brissac, Jim Backus, Doran, Edward Platt and James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause (1955) ==Television== Doran played Charlotte McHenry, the housekeeper on Shirley, Agnes Haskell, Eddie Haskell's mother and in a separate appearance Mrs. Bellamy, in Leave It to BeaverTerrace, Vincent (2011). Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 591. and Mrs. Kingston, the housekeeper, on Longstreet. Doran guest-starred on many television programs, including three appearances in the role of Bonnie Landis in The Public Defender, starring with fellow Texan Reed Hadley. She appeared in the anthology series Crossroads in the 1956 episode \\"The White Carnation\\", along with Elinor Donahue, James Best and J. Carrol Naish. In 1952, she appeared in an episode of The Lone Ranger titled \\"Hidden Fortune\\". Doran was cast in the children's Western My Friend Flicka, the story of a boy and his horse on a ranch in Wyoming. She also appeared in episodes of Ray Milland's sitcom Meet Mr. McNutley and Kenneth Tobey's aviation adventure series Whirlybirds. Doran guest-starred on Perry Mason in \\"The Case of the Prodigal Parent\\" (1958), \\"The Case of the Lurid Letter\\" (1962) and \\"The Case of the Drowsy Mosquito\\" (1963) as well as in Rawhide in the episode \\"Incident of the Challenge\\". Doran was cast twice in 1959-1960 in episodes of the series Colt .45, starring Wayde Preston. In 1960, she was cast as Martha Brown, the mother of horse rider Velvet Brown (Lori Martin) in the family drama National Velvet. She made one appearance on McHale's Navy as Mrs. Martha \\"Pumpkin\\" Binghamton, wife of Captain Binghamton (Joe Flynn). In 1963 Doran appeared as Minerva Lewis on The Virginian in the episode \\"Run Away Home.\\" Ann Doran was cast twice as Mrs. Elliott and Hugh Beaumont as Mr. Elliott, parents of Steve Elliott (Mike Minor), in Petticoat Junction. Doran in her later years Three years later, she appeared in the first episode of The Legend of Jesse James as Zerelda James Samuel, the mother of Jesse and Frank James. She also appeared on the program M*A*S*H as Nurse Meg Cratty, who runs an orphanage in Korea. In the episode \\"The Kids\\", Cratty and her charges bunked with the M*A*S*H unit to avoid snipers. ==Death== Doran died at age 89 on September 19, 2000, in Carmichael, California. Following her death, her remains were cremated and scattered at sea. She bequeathed $400,000 to the Motion Picture Country House, the retirement home for the movie industry. ==Legacy== July 28, 2016 was designated as Ann Doran Day in Amarillo, Texas. ==Filmography== ===Films=== { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 90%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" align=\\"center\\" !

It is one of the oldest suspension railways, having entered service in 1901, the same year the Wuppertal Schwebebahn entered service. Like the Wuppertal railway, this system was designed by Eugen Langen. The line is long and is supported on 33 pillars. ==Overview== Despite its unusual suspended format, the Dresden Suspension Railway is operated as a conventional funicular railway. The two cars are attached to each other by a cable, which runs around a drum at the top of the incline. The ascending car is pulled up the hill by the weight of the descending car, assisted if necessary by an electric drive to the drum. The line has the following technical parameters: *Length: '''' *Height: '''' *Maximum Steepness: 39.2% *Cars: 2 *Capacity: 40 passengers per car *Configuration: Double suspension track (Monorail) *Maximum speed: '''' *Traction: Electricity The Schwebebahn was not damaged in World War II, but it was out of service from 1984 to 1992 due to reconstruction. In 1990 and 2002, extensive repair works took place and there is now a new lookout point on the roof of the station. The Schwebebahn is one of two funicular railways in Dresden, the other being the much more conventional Dresden Cable Car. Both lines are operated by the Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe AG, who also operate the city's tram, bus and ferry networks. == See also == * List of funicular railways *Dresden Funicular Railway since 1895 ==References== Specific General # Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe (Hg.): Bergauf, bergab mit den Dresdner Bergbahnen.

This is a version of the Hankel contour that consists of just a linear mirror image across the real axis. In mathematics, a Hankel contour is a path in the complex plane which extends from (+‚àû,Œ¥), around the origin counter clockwise and back to (+‚àû,‚àíŒ¥), where Œ¥ is an arbitrarily small positive number. The contour thus remains arbitrarily close to the real axis but without crossing the real axis except for negative values of x. The Hankel contour can also be represented by a path that has mirror images just above and below the real axis, connected to a circle of radius Œµ, centered at the origin, where Œµ is an arbitrarily small number. The two linear portions of the contour are said to be a distance of Œ¥ from the real axis. Thus, the total distance between the linear portions of the contour is 2Œ¥. The contour is traversed in the positively-oriented sense, meaning that the circle around the origin is traversed counter-clockwise. Use of Hankel contours is one of the methods of contour integration. This type of path for contour integrals was first used by Hermann Hankel in his investigations of the Gamma function. The Hankel contour is used to evaluate integrals such as the Gamma function, the Riemann-Zeta function, and other Hankel functions (which are Bessel functions of the third kind). == Applications of the Hankel Contour == === The Hankel Contour and the Gamma Function === The Hankel contour is helpful in expressing and solving the Gamma function in the complex t-plane. The Gamma-function can be defined for any complex value in the plane if we evaluate the integral along the Hankel contour. The Hankel contour is especially useful for expressing the Gamma function for any complex value because the end points of the contour vanish, and thus allows the fundamental property of the Gamma function to be satisfied, which states \\\\Gamma(z+1)=z\\\\Gamma(z). ==== Derivation of the Contour Integral Expression of the Gamma function ==== Note that the formal representation of the Gamma-function is \\\\Gamma(z)=\\\\int_C f(t)t^{z-1} dt. To satisfy the fundamental property of the Gamma function, it follows that \\\\int_C f(t)t^z dt =[t^zf(t)]-\\\\int_C t^z f'(t)dt after multiplying both sides by z. Thus, given that the endpoints of the Hankel contour vanish, the left- and right-hand sides reduce to f(t)+f'(t)=0. Using differential equations, f(t)=Ae^{-t} becomes the general solution. While A is constant with respect to t, it holds that A may fluctuate depending on the complex number z. Since A(z) is arbitrary, a complex exponential in z may be absorbed into the definition of A(z). Substituting f(t) into the original integral then gives \\\\Gamma(z)=A(z)\\\\int_C e^{-t}(-t)^{z-1}dt. By integrating along the Hankel contour, the contour integral expression of the Gamma function becomes \\\\Gamma(z)=\\\\frac{i}{2\\\\sin{\\\\pi z}}\\\\int_C e^{-t}(-t)^{z-1}dt. ==References== == Further reading == * Schmelzer, Thomas; Trefethen, Lloyd N.

A Navy pilot, Denton's jet was shot down over North Vietnam in July 1965. Denton and his navigator, Bill Tschudy, parachuted down and were soon taken prisoner. Both men spent seven years and seven months in North Vietnam as often-tortured POWs. In 1979, the book was made into a television movie starring Hal Holbrook. It was adapted by screenwriter Jake Justiz, also known as Lee Pogostin. Denton, James Stockdale (who graduated with Denton at the Naval Academy), Larry Guarino, and James Robinson Risner, distinguished themselves as members of the American POW resistance movement from 1965 to 1973, helping POWs accomplish their sworn goal to \\"return with honor\\".

He listened to old-time and country music on the radio by the Carter Family, the Skillet Lickers, Roy Acuff, and the Monroe Brothers (Charlie and Bill Monroe). He learned guitar at age 11 or 12, then mandolin, dobro, and fiddle in his teens. When he was 16, he dropped out of school to play music professionally. In the 1950s, Blake joined the Dixieland Drifters and performed on radio broadcasts, then joined the Lonesome Travelers. When he was drafted in 1961, he served as an Army radio operator in the Panama Canal Zone. He started a popular band known as the Kobbe Mountaineers. A year later, while he was on leave, he recorded the album Twelve Shades of Bluegrass with the Lonesome Travelers. ===Nashville and Johnny Cash=== After being discharged from the Army, Blake moved to Nashville and became a studio musician. For ten years, he toured and recorded with country singer Johnny Cash and continued to play with Cash intermittently over the next thirty. He met Nancy Short, a cellist with a classical music background who was playing in a folk group. He was asked by Bob Dylan to play on the country-folk album Nashville Skyline, then became a member of the house band on Johnny Cash's TV show. Kris Kristofferson, one of the guests, hired Blake to tour with him. Blake recorded with folk singer Joan Baez and appeared on her hit song \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\". In 1971, he became a member of the bluegrass group Aero- plain, led by multi-instrumentalist John Hartford with fiddler Vassar Clements, but the band didn't last long. Blake also played dobro on the 1972 album, Will the Circle Be Unbroken by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. In 1972, Blake recorded his first solo album, Home in Sulphur Springs (Rounder, 1972). Soon after his debut, he and Nancy recorded their first album, The Fields of November (Flying Fish, 1974), with Nancy on hillbilly cello. They married in 1975 and performed together for twenty years. ===Style=== Most of the music that Norman Blake plays could be described as neo-traditionalist Americana folk and roots music (folk, bluegrass, country, blues), and many of the songs he plays are traditional, but he plays this acoustic type of music with a style, speed, and quality that has evolved and progressed in the modern age. Though probably best known for his fluid renditions of classic fiddle tunes transcribed for the guitar (\\"Fiddler's Dram/Whiskey Before Breakfast\\"), Blake has also written songs that have become bluegrass and folk standards, such as \\"Ginseng Sullivan\\", \\"Slow Train through Georgia\\", \\"Billy Gray\\", and \\"Church Street Blues\\". Although known as one of the most prominent steel-string guitar flatpickers, Blake is a multi-instrumentalist and vocalist. Other instruments he plays include the mandolin, 6-string banjo, fiddle, dobro, banjo and viola.CD liner notes from The Fields of November, Flying Fish Records, 1992 He is known for his loose, right-hand guitar technique, which arose out of his mandolin technique. Also well known is his devotion to 12-fret guitars, including Martin 00s, 000s, D18s, D28s, and Gibsons, like his 1929 12-fret Nick Lucas special. ===Awards and honors=== Blake played on the album Raising Sand by Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, which won five Grammy Awards, and on the soundtrack O Brother, Where Art Thou?, which won a Grammy for Album of the Year. Norman and Nancy Blake received Grammy nominations in the Best Traditional Folk Recording category for Blind Dog, Just Gimme Somethin' I'm Used To, While Passing Along This Way, and The Hobo's Last Ride. In 1986 Norman Blake was chosen Best Multi-Instrumentalist by the readers of Frets magazine. ==Discography== * Back Home in Sulphur Springs (Rounder, 1972) * The Fields of November (Flying Fish, 1974) * Old and New (Flying Fish, 1975) * Norman Blake and Red Rector (Country, 1976) * Whiskey Before Breakfast (Rounder, 1976) * Live at McCabe's (Takoma, 1976) * Norman Blake/Tut Taylor/Sam Bush/Butch Robins/Vassar Clements/David Holland/Jethro Burns (Flying Fish, 1976) * Blackberry Blossom (Flying Fish, 1977) * Directions (Takoma, 1978) * Rising Fawn String Ensemble (Rounder, 1979) * Full Moon on the Farm (Rounder, 1981) * Original Underground Music from the Mysterious South (Rounder, 1983) * Nashville Blues (Rounder, 1984) * Lighthouse on the Shore (Rounder, 1985) * Natasha's Waltz (Rounder, 1987) * Slow Train Through Georgia (Rounder, 1987) * Blake & Rice (Rounder, 1987) * Blind Dog (Rounder, 1988) * Norman Blake and Tony Rice 2 (Rounder, 1990) * Just Gimme Somethin' I'm Used To (Shanachie, 1992) * While Passing Along This Way (Shanachie, 1994) * The Hobo's Last Ride (Shanachie, 1996) * Chattanooga Sugar Babe (Shanachie, 1998) * Be Ready Boys: Appalachia to Abilene (Plectrafone/Western Jubilee, 1999) * Far Away, Down on a Georgia Farm (Shanachie, 1999) * Flower from the Fields of Alabama (Shanachie, 2001) * Meeting on Southern Soil (Red House, 2002) * Old Ties (Rounder, 2002) * The Morning Glory Ramblers (Plectrafone/Western Jubilee, 2004) * Back Home in Sulphur Springs (Dualtone, 2006) * Shacktown Road (Plectrafone/Western Jubilee, 2007) * Look A-Yonder Comin' (State Archives of Florida, 2008) * Rising Fawn Gathering (Plectrafone/Western Jubilee, 2009) * Sleepy Eyed Joe (Rounder, 2009) * Green Light on the Southern (Plectrafone/Western Jubilee, 2010) * Wood, Wire & Words (Plectrafone/Western Jubilee, 2015) * Brushwood Songs & Stories (Plectrafone/Western Jubilee, 2017) ===Soundtracks=== * O Brother, Where Art Thou?

Article 102 ==Powers== As the Russian legislature, all laws must be voted in the Federal Assembly before they are signed into law. All bills, even those proposed by the Federation Council, must first be considered by the State Duma. Upon adoption by a majority of the full State Duma membership, a draft law is considered by the Federation Council, which has fourteen days to place the bill on its calendar. The Federation Council cannot make changes in bills passed by the Duma and can either approve or reject them. If the Federation Council rejects a bill passed by the State Duma, the two chambers may form a conciliation commission to work out a compromise version of the legislation. If two chambers cannot reach a compromise, or the Duma insists on passing the bill as is, the veto of the Federation Council can be overridden, if two thirds of the Duma's constitutional composition vote in favor of the bill. The State Duma and the Federation Council usually meet separately. Joint sessions are organized when: *President of Russia delivers his annual address to the Federal Assembly; *For hearing of addresses of the Constitutional Court of Russia; *To hear the speeches of leaders of foreign States. ==Parliamentary centre== In the mid 2000s it was suggested that the Parliamentary centre of the State Duma and Federation Council be combined into one building. In 2012, the idea was supported by President Dmitry Medvedev. Reasons cited for the construction of a new building included the cramped nature of the parliament members' current offices, the remote locations of these offices split across ten locations in Moscow, and the desire of the government to move the bodies away from the city centre to reduce traffic congestion. Various areas of Moscow were examined to serve as the new parliamentary center: Kutuzovsky Prospekt, Frunzenskaya embankment, \\"Moscow City\\", Tushino airfield, Krasnaya Presnya, Moskvoretskaya embankment, Park Museon and the Sofia embankment. In September 2014, the Mnyovniki floodplain was selected, a decision which was protested by ecologists.the Moscow Government is going to relocate the Russian Parliament in Mnevniki The design of the new building was to be decided on the basis of an architectural competition. The parliamentarians, however, disagreed on aesthetic decisions between candidates in the competition, which were not resolved when the contest was conducted a second time. Financing issues caused complications. Originally, the Parliamentary center was to be funded by private investors, who would in turn receive ownership of a building currently belonging to the State Duma and the Federation Council, as well as permits to tear it down and replace the building with their own development projects (such as hotels). An objection to this plan was lodged by architectural critic Grigory Revzin, arguing that the State Duma is located in the building of the Council of Labor and Defense which was designed by Arkady Langman and built in 1935, rendering the existing State Duma building an architectural monument, which would be protected by the state and cannot be demolished.

More recently he has worked to popularize his theory that the American singer Elvis Presley is still living. ==Early years== Beeny, whose father died when he was nine years old, was one of five children. During his late teens and early twenties, he worked as a tavern porter and manager in Eldorado, Illinois, the hometown of the woman he married at age eighteen. Beeny battled recurrent tuberculosis as a young man; during one painful recuperation, as he later explained, he \\"got disgusted with my life and was converted to the Christian faith.\\" He was ordained by the Southern Baptist Convention in 1947, and during the 1950s he attended Shurtleff College in Alton, Illinois and the American Divinity School in Chicago, Illinois.\\"Evangelist Beeny Tells of Penchant for Sticking Head in Lion's Mouth,\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 23 Apr. 1961. ==Political and ministerial career== Over the course of the 1950s and 1960s, Beeny based himself in St. Louis, where he was active in domestic anti-communist campaigns and led local and national efforts directed against civil-rights and student- movement leaders. In 1961, Beeny picketed Washington University in St. Louis, urging the U.S. House Committee on Un-American Activities to investigate his allegations of communist \\"infiltration\\" among university faculty - especially those who had signed a nuclear-test-ban petition organized by California chemist and Nobel laureate Linus Pauling.\\"Evangelist Sees U.S. Officials on Red Inquiry,\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 12 Apr. 1961; \\"What Ever Happened to Bill Beeny,\\" St. Louis Globe-Democrat, 14-15 Aug. 1976. He also participated in national petition drives urging the Committee to investigate the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Black Panthers.\\"Evangelist Sees U.S. Officials on Red Inquiry,\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 12 Apr. 1961. Beeny's political and religious radio broadcasts, which began with one station in Alton, Illinois, were eventually heard on dozens of stations across the country. At the same time, the minister operated an \\"anti-communist\\" youth ranch in Wright City, Missouri; the ranch, according to Beeny's claim, drew upwards of 1,500 campers per summer during the early 1960s. Beeny faced constant legal problems over questionable financial practices at his Missouri Youth Ranch and his Denver-area radio station \\"The Voice of Reason.\\"\\"Voice of Reason, Inc.,\\" Federal Register, vol. 35, no. 85 (1 May 1970): 6988-89; \\"Bill Beeny Is Refused Broadcasting License,\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 5-6 Mar. 1971. In 1960, accusations of marital infidelity forced Beeny from his position as pastor of the New Testament Baptist Church, which he had founded in a St. Louis storefront five years earlier. Lawsuits over an allegedly fraudulent bond issue to finance his ranch and broadcasting operations soon followed.\\"Evangelist Says He Resigned as Pastor over 'Differences,'\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 9 Apr. 1961.

Beeny organized Missouri rallies in support of the Vietnam War through the 1960s.\\"Beeny March Supports War,\\" Springfield (MO) Press Leader, 1 Nov. 1965. In 1966, the minister formed the Counter-Revolutionary Organization on Salvation and Service (CROSS), with chapters in Miami, Florida and St. Louis. Working out of Beeny's Baptist church at 4249 Gibson Avenue, CROSS's St. Louis chapter organized several controversial \\"home-defense\\" seminars. The meetings were intended to instruct members in fire-arms and survivalist tactics in order to fend off what Beeny called \\"those so-called civil-rights groups now reported to be stocking weapons\\" in preparation for a revolutionary uprising.\\"Beeny Displays Weapons for 'Home Defense,'\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 27 Jun. 1966.

Beeny's own campaign platform, as outlined in his newsletter The Herald of Missouri, urged \\"states' rights,\\" opposed open-housing legislation and bussing for school integration, and advocated a \\"tough-on-crime\\" policy that would include ordering police to \\"shoot to kill\\" in response to civil disorders.The Herald of Missouri, 1968, copy held in Beeny folder, Group Research Archives, Columbia Rare Books and Manuscripts Library, New York, NY. Beeny also recorded gospel music and played it with a father/daughter duo, Ora and Gwen Gaulden of St. Louis, Missouri. ==Elvis Presley-related work== The minister relocated to Wright City, Missouri, in 1969 after a fire at his St. Louis church.\\"What Ever Happened to Bill Beeny,\\" St. Louis Globe-Democrat, 14-15 Aug. 1976. There, he operated a general store and more recently has sought to popularize his theory that the American singer Elvis Presley, who died in 1977, is still living. Beeny was owner of The 50s Cafe, which was packed with 1950s memorabilia focusing mainly on Presley and Marilyn Monroe. Beeny also founded the Elvis is Alive Museum in his Wright City store space in 1992, and, in 2005, he published his book Elvis' DNA Proves He's Alive.Bill Beeny, Elvis' DNA Proves He's Alive (Boston: Branden Books, 2005), . Beeny maintains a website dedicated to Presley and to his own museum. Beeny has also resumed broadcasts of pre-recorded religious, political and Elvis Presley- related content, this time via the internet. In October 2007, Bill Beeny placed the entire contents of his museum and his two websites on sale on eBay, as one lot. The sale attracted attention from national news outlets such as The New York Times and National Public Radio.Malcolm Gay, \\"Giving Up the Memorabilia, but Not the Belief: Elvis Lives,\\" The New York Times, 8 Nov. 2007.\\"Elvis Museum Goes on eBay,\\" Morning Edition, National Public Radio, 2 Nov. 2007.Jason Beaubien, \\"Preacher Selling Elvis Museum on eBay,\\" Day to Day, National Public Radio, 7 Nov. 2007.

Each of the 85 federal subjects of Russia ‚Äì consisting of 22 republics, 46 oblasts, nine krais, three federal cities, four autonomous okrugs, and one autonomous oblast ‚Äì sends two senators to the Council, for a total membership of 170 Senators. In addition, the Constitution also provides for senators from the Russian Federation, which can be no more than thirty, as well as (optionally) former presidents as life senators ( there are no such life senators). The council holds its sessions within the Main Building on Bolshaya Dmitrovka Street in Moscow, the former home of the Soviet State Building Agency (Gosstroy), with further offices and committee rooms located on Novy Arbat Street. The two houses of the Federal Assembly are physically separated, with the State Duma residing in another part of Moscow on Okhotny Ryad Street. Sessions of the Federation Council take place in Moscow from January 25 to July 15, and from September 16 to December 31. Sessions are open to the public, although the location of sessions can change if the Federation Council so desires, and secure closed sessions may be convoked. For purposes of succession, the chairman of the Federation Council is the third-highest position in the Russian Federation, after the president and the prime minister.

May 21, 2002. The modern history of the Federation Council begins during the 1993 Constitutional Crisis that pitted President Boris Yeltsin's unpopular neoliberal and governmental structure reforms against the increasingly radical Congress of People's Deputies, the nation's legislature. Throughout the year, the congress had grown increasingly dissatisfied with Yeltsin and his cabinet's management of the floundering Russian economy, as well as with its plans for a new constitution for the Russian Federation to replace the Soviet-era 1978 Russian SFSR Constitution still in effect. In the midst of the increasingly tense crisis, on September 21, Yeltsin issued Presidential Decree No.1400. The decree effectively scrapped constitutional reform then presently in discussion, as well as legally dissolving the Congress of People's Deputies, ordering its replacement with an entirely new federal legislative structure, and granting the president increased executive powers. Following a war of words and acts of defiance from both sides, President Yeltsin abruptly ended the governmental power struggle by ordering the Russian army to bombard and storm the White House of Russia, the legislative building, between October 2‚Äì4, 1993. Following the crushing of the Congress of People's Deputies and other members of the federal and territorial governments who had initially supported what he viewed as a rebellious legislature, Yeltsin proceeded to present a new constitution. With the events of 1993 very much in mind, Yeltsin drafted a constitution that called for increased executive branch powers in prime ministerial appointments, veto overrides, and a stronger executive security council. The constitution also called for the creation of a bicameral Federal Assembly, consisting of a State Duma and a Federation Council. Although a Federation Council had been created by Yeltsin in July 1993 to gather regional representatives (except Chechnya) to support an earlier draft of a replacement constitution to the 1978 document, this Federation Council was to become a permanent part of the legislature. The procedure of formation of the Federation Council by elections held according to the majority system was defined by Presidential Decrees No. 1626 from October 11, 1993 \\"On Elections to the Council of Federation of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation\\" and No. 1846 from November 6, 1993 \\"On Specification to the Resolution on Elections of Deputies to the State Duma and Resolution on Elections of Deputies to the Council of Federation of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation in 1993\\". Similar to the United States Senate, the Federation Council would consist of two representatives from each of Russia's federal subjects. Unlike the State Duma, which consisted of hundreds of districts across the nation, the Federation Council was to act as more or less the voice of Russia's federated subdivisions. Early debate on its creation centered on whether or not the Federation Council should be elected at all. To solve some problems on the Council's first scheduled election in December, Yeltsin issued Presidential Decree No. 1628 on October 11, stipulating that candidates for the first elections needed at least two percent, or 25,000 signatures‚Äîwhichever was highest‚Äîof their oblast, republic, krai, autonomous okrug, or federal city population. This helped previous territorial elites remain within national politics. The decree also stipulated a single term of two years before new elections in 1995. President Boris Yeltsin was instrumental in the creation of the Federation Council in 1993. The Council's first elections were held on December 12, 1993, simultaneously with State Duma elections and a referendum on the new Constitution of the Russian Federation. With the constitution now in effect after its successful passage, elections for the Council were to be franchised solely to territorial authorities, with one senator elected from the subject's legislature, and the other by the subject's executive branch. This later was codified in 1995 when the Council's first term expired. The constitution, however, did not specify how senators were to be elected. By 1995, using this constitutional anomaly, regional executives could sit ex officio in both their own regional executive posts and within the Federation Council. While the State Duma did much of the serious debates on Russian policy during this time, the Council became a lobby for regional interests, competing for federal attention. The ascension of President Vladimir Putin following Yeltsin's resignation on December 31, 1999 brought many new changes to the Federation Council. As part of his top political goals in his first months of office in 2000, Putin proposed a reform law to change the makeup of the Council which would allow regional governors to designate councillors but not sit on the Council themselves, freeing it from what Putin saw as blatant personal cronyism on the part of regional leaders. The Council furiously resisted Putin's plan, conscious that their role in federal politics, their very ability to enjoy the fruits of living within Moscow, and their parliamentary immunity would end. With the State Duma threatening to override a Council veto, and Putin's threats to open federal criminal investigations on regional governors, the Council backed down and grudgingly supported the law in July 2000. In their place, a wave of new Kremlin-friendly senators took the vacated seats, complete with the full backing of Putin. The last of these dual senator-governors were rotated out of office in early 2002. Following the Beslan school hostage crisis in September 2004, President Putin initiated a radical shakeup of the federal system, proposing that the direct elections of regional governors be replaced by appointments from the president himself. These appointments could later be confirmed or rejected by the regional legislatures. The move further placed more control over the Council by the executive branch, due to laws which stipulate that regional executives have a say in choosing delegates to the Federation council. Since 2000, the Federation Council has largely remained a stable body. However, critics have charged that Putin's tactics in reforming the Council were blatantly undemocratic and anti-federal, arguing that the reforms created a rubber stamp body for the executive branch and the ruling United Russia party, similar to what the Soviet of Nationalities was during the Soviet period. ==Officers and members== As set in Article 101 of the Russian Constitution, the Federation Council ‚Äúshall elect among its deputies the chairman of the Council.‚Äù Some of the Chairman's official duties include presiding over sessions, formulating and introducing draft agendas, issuing orders and consulting with the Council's various committees, acting as the Council's official representative in the Federal Assembly, and signing resolutions to be passed forth to the president or the State Duma. The current chairman is Valentina Matviyenko. Senators are able to retain membership to their respective parties, however they are asked not to bring party factionalism to the floor itself. Since the reforms of 2000, the Council has enjoyed a significantly close relationship with the Kremlin, helping easy passage of key legislation the Kremlin desires. According to Article 98, all the members of the Council enjoy immunity from arrest, detainment, and searches. In 2007 the law on the Federation Council was amended, and now a senator must have resided for at least ten years in the territory he is representing. The status of members of the Federation Council is defined by the Federal Law: \\"On Status of Members of the Council of Federation and Status of Deputy of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation\\". === Presidium === The presidium consists in a chairman, four deputy chairmen and a general secretary. ===Political affiliation=== Unlike the State Duma, with its division of parties and leaders, in 2002 parliamentary groups were forbidden following Mironov's election to the chairmanship and the parliamentary procedures to disband all political factions. ==Elections== Unlike the State Duma and the provincial legislatures throughout Russia, the Council is not directly elected, but instead chosen by territorial politicians, resembling in some respects the structure of the U.S. Senate prior to the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. The only exclusion was the first Federation council (1994‚Äì1996), which was elected on December 12, 1993. According to Article 95, the Council comprises representatives of each Russian federal subject‚Äîtwo from each. One senator is elected by the provincial legislature, the other is nominated by the provincial governor and confirmed by the legislature. Prior to 2000, all provincial governors and heads of provincial legislatures were also members of the Council. Upon President Putin's ascension to the Russian presidency, this practice was discontinued under pressure from the Kremlin, forbidding governors to hold dual posts. Terms to the Council are also not nationally fixed, due to the continuing territorial nature of the chamber. Terms instead are determined according to the regional bodies they represent. In 2001‚Äì2004 regional bodies were able to recall their senator by the same procedure as they've appointed him or her. Such recalls once occurred quite often. But a new law passed in December 2004 required that a recall procedure must be first initiated by the chairman of Federation Council. The procedure hasn't been implemented since. On January 1, 2013, the latest Law on the Procedure to Form the Federation Council entered into force: According to the Law, the Federation Council consists of two delegates from each Russian constituent component, one representing the given region's legislative assembly and the other representing the provincial executive authorities. There will be two different election procedures, one for each type of member. (Federal Law No. 229, art. 1.1.) Candidates for the Senator from a constituent component's legislature must be a member of the component region's legislative assembly. He or she will be nominated as a candidate by the chairman of the regional legislative assembly, by one party faction represented in the assembly, or by at least one-fifth of the assembly members. Then, the regional legislative assembly will vote for one of the nominated candidates. An amendment to the law was approved in July 2014, which add 17 more senators who are nominated by the president. The second type of delegate to the Federation Council, the regional executive authority representative, is appointed by the Governor of that constituent component (or the Head of that autonomous republic). The delegate is selected from among three people named by the candidates for the office of governor/head of the concerned region. The winner of the gubernatorial/republican leadership election appoints one of the three he or she previously named for appointment to the Council as a senator of said region. ==Powers== Federation Council is viewed as a more formal chamber of the Federal Assembly. Because of its federalist design, as well as its voting franchise strictly limited to provincial elites, the Council is viewed as less volatile to radical changes. The Council is charged in cooperating with the State Duma in completing and voting on draft laws. Federal laws concerning budgets, customs regulations, credit monitoring, and the ratification of international treaties are to be considered by the Council after they have been adopted from the State Duma, where most legislation is introduced. Special powers that accorded only to the Federation Council are: * Approval of changes in borders between the subjects of the Russian Federation; * Approval of a decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the introduction of martial law; * Approval of a decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the introduction of a state of emergency; * Deciding on the possibility of using the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation outside the territory of the Russian Federation; * Declaring of elections of the President of the Russian Federation; * Impeachment of the President of the Russian Federation; * approving the president's nomination of judges of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, of the Supreme Arbitration Court of the Russian Federal government * approving the president's nomination of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation; * Appointment of Deputy Chairman and half of the auditors of the Accounting Chamber. For laws to pass the Federation Council, a vote of more than half of its 187 senators is required. When considering federal constitutional laws, three-fourths of the Council's votes are required for passage. If the Council vetoes a law passed by the State Duma, the two chambers are mandated to form a Conciliation Committee in order to form a compromise document, which would again go under vote by both houses. The Federation Council's veto can be overcome by two-thirds majority in the Duma. ==Committees== Committees form a key component to the structure of the Council. Sixteen committees and seven commissions exist for senators to consider legislation and policy on a number of issues ranging from foreign affairs, federal affairs, and youth and sports. Leadership in these committees are determined by the Council Chairman, who remains in correspondence with their findings. These committees include: U.S. Congress delegation in Russia's Federation Council, July 3, 2018 *Committee on Constitutional Legislation *Committee on Judicial and Legal Affairs *Committee on Defence and Security *Budgetary Committee *Committee on Financial Markets and Currency Circulation *Foreign Affairs Committee *Committee on the Commonwealth of Independent States *Committee on Federal Affairs and Regional Policies *Committee on Local Government *Social Policy Committee *Committee on Economic Policy, Business and Ownership *Industrial Policy Committee *Committee on Natural Resources and Environmental Protection *Committee on Food and Agricultural Policies *Committee for Science, Culture, Education, Public Health and Ecology *Committee on Northern Territories and Indigenous Minorities *Commission on Standing Orders and Parliamentary Performance Organisation *Commission for the Council of Federation's Performance Maintenance Monitoring *Commission on Ways and Means of the Council of Federation's Constitutional Powers Implementation *Commission for Interaction with the Accounts Chamber of the Russian Federation *Commission on Youth and Sports *Commission on Information Policy *Commission on Natural Monopolies ==Chairpeople of the Federation Council== Valentina Matviyenko is current Chairwoman of the Federation Council *Vladimir Shumeyko 13 January 1994 - 23 January 1996 *Yegor Stroyev 23 January 1996 - 5 December 2001 *Sergey Mironov 5 December 2001 - 18 May 2011 **Aleksander Torshin 19 May - 21 September 2011 (Acting) *Valentina Matviyenko 21 September 2011 ‚Äì present day ==Presidential Envoys to the Federation Council== * Alexander Maksimovich Yakovlev (February 18, 1994, ‚Äì February 10, 1996) * Anatoly Sliva (February 10, 1996, ‚Äì October 27, 1998) * Yury Yarov (December 7, 1998, ‚Äì April 13, 1999) * Vyacheslav Khizhnyakov (May 12, 1999, ‚Äì April 5, 2004) * Alexander Kotenkov (April 5, 2004, ‚Äì October 30, 2013) * Arthur Muravyov (Since October 30, 2013)–ü–æ–ª–Ω–æ–º–æ—á–Ω—ã–º –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª–µ–º –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –≤ –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç–µ –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –Ω–∞–∑–Ω–∞—á–µ–Ω –ê—Ä—Ç—É—Ä –ú—É—Ä–∞–≤—å—ë–≤ // –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏–†—É–∫–æ–≤–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∏ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω—ã–µ –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –ª–∏—Ü–∞ –ê–¥–º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ // –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ ==See also== *List of deputy chairmen of the Federation Council of Russia *Politics of Russia ==Notes== ==References== *McFaul, Michael.

The yeshiva has over three thousand students, including those of affiliated institutions, and is considered one the leading Litvish yeshivas in Israel. ==History== Founded in 1908, the yeshiva was originally located in city of Panevƒó≈æys (Ponevezh), Lithuania prior to the Holocaust. After the death of its founder, Rabbi Yitzhak Yaakov Rabinovich, the yeshiva was re-established in Bnei Brak in 1944 by Rabbi Yosef Shlomo Kahaneman, who was residing in British Mandate of Palestine at the time. Kahaneman appointed Rabbi Shmuel Rozovsky as dean, and some years later appointed Rabbi Dovid Povarsky as rosh yeshiva. The Kahaneman faction of the yeshiva is led by Rabbi Gershon Eidelstein and Rabbi Berel Povarsky, son of Rabbi Dovid Povarsky, and Rabbi Chaim Peretz Berman, a grandson of The Steipler, and a son-in-law of Rabbi Kahanaman. The Markovitz faction of the yeshiva is led by Rabbi Shmuel Markovitz, Rabbi Asher Deutch, and Rabbi Dessler. The main study hall has an original 16th-century Italian wooden aron kodesh (Torah scroll ark), brought to the yeshiva in the early 1980s, and restored and re-gilded with 22 carat gild leaf.

It was founded in 1877 by Rabbi Yisrael Lipkin Salanter when he was 67. Kovno Kollel's purpose was the furtherance of hora'ah (expertise in deciding matters of Jewish law) and musar - by supporting and guiding exceptional Torah scholars in their development as authorities. thumbrightLibrary book stamp, Kovno Kollel Library ==History== In 1877, Rabbi Yisroel ben Ze‚Äôev Wolf Lipkin ‚Äì also known as Yisroel Salanter ‚Äì founded a Kollel (a yeshiva for young, mostly married, men) in the city of Kaunes (Kovno), Lithuania. The purpose of this Kollel was to teach aspiring scholars the ways of the Musar movement (of which Lipkin was the founder), a non-Hasidic Orthodox movement that sought to emphasize ethical conduct and spiritual devotion. The project received the blessings, and eventually the name, of the Kovno Rav and posek hador (the generation's outstanding authority in Jewish law), Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor, the rabbi of Kovno. Over the course of several decades the Kovno Kollel grew in size as well as reputation and came to be closely associated with the Musar movement ‚Äì all of which was possible in a city with as vibrant a Jewish community as that which was found in Kovno before the Second World War. When the Nazis invaded and occupied Kovno the Kollel suffered the same tragic fate as most of the city‚Äôs Jewish residents. ==Innovations== Until 1877, yeshivas only subsidized students until they got married (at an early age). When the Kollel was established, Rabbi Salanter was attacked by many, precisely for this point. He instituted the practice of paying a small salary to married students to continue their advanced Talmudical studies. He defended this innovation because he said that he was training leaders. His argument was that the need for well-trained communal leaders mandated this drastic action. The justification was that these individuals would eventually serve the community, and it was not that because they sat and learned that they should be supported. By 1877-1878, ten scholars had begun their full-time studies, following a curriculum which included the study of musar literature. In 1879, Rabbi Spektor became its head. Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel served as the mashgiach of the kollel. Rabbi Spektor's son, Rabbi Zvi Hirsh RabinowitzFor a biography of Rabbi Rabinowitz, see pp. 195-200 of Jacob Mark's Gedolim Fun Unzer Zeit (Oryom Press, New York, NY, 1927) accepted the administrative responsibilities and was one of the roshei kollel (heads of the kollel), while Rabbi Avrohom Shenker and Rabbi Finkel conducted the internal affairs. Under the latter's guidance, the book Eitz Pri was published, featuring essays by Rabbis Salanter and Spektor - including a foreword by the then lesser-known Rabbi Yisroel Meir HaKohen (the \\"Chafetz Chaim\\"). In 1880, Finkel left the kollel so he could devote himself to establishing more kollelim throughout Eastern Europe. In 1880, Spektor also left the Kollel, and Salanter's student Yitzchak Blazer became its new head. Under Blazer's direction, the kollel came to be \\"considered by its contemporaries as a bastion of the Mussar movement,\\" and was attacked by the Mussar movement's opponents.Immanuel Etkes, Rabbi Israel Salanter and the Mussar Movement, 275 The Kovno Kollel was later transferred to Slabodka, a suburb of Kovno, where Rabbi Shimon Zvi Dubiansky was appointed rosh kollel and served there until the outbreak of World War II. ==Chavrei kollel (Kollel members)== * Rabbi Yosef Yozel Horwitz * Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetsky * Rabbi Dovid Leibowitz * Rabbi Chaim Rabinowitz * Rabbi Svei (father of Rabbi Elya Svei) ==References== Category:Educational institutions established in 1877 Category:History of Kaunas Category:Kollelim Category:Yeshivas of Lithuania Category:Musar movement ","title":"Kovno Kollel"},{"id":"1268607","text":"Remy Ong (; born 22 November 1978) is a Singaporean bowler and former world champion.

In 1868, following a visit the previous year to New Orleans and while Mobile was still under Union occupation, Joe Cain paraded through the streets of Mobile, dressed in improvised costume as a fictional \\"Chickasaw\\" chief named Slacabamorinico. The choice was an attempt to insult to U.S. Army forces in that it was believed by some that the Chickasaw tribe had never been defeated in war. Joe was joined at some point by six other Confederate veterans, parading in a decorated coal wagon, playing drums and horns, and the group became the \\"L. C. Minstrel Band\\", now commonly referred to as the \\"Lost Cause Minstrels\\" of Mobile. == Life and work == Joseph Stillwell Cain, Jr. was born on October 10, 1832, along Dauphin Street in Mobile, Alabama. He was a son of Joseph Cain, Sr. (1799‚Äì1856) \\"Grave Search Results\\" (parents), Find a Grave, 2007, webpage: FGp. and Julia Ann Turner (1795‚Äì1877). Joe Cain (junior) married Elizabeth Alabama Rabby (1835‚Äì1907). He helped to organize the T.D.S. (Tea Drinker‚Äôs Society), one of Mobile's mystic societies, in 1846; however, their banquets were part of Mobile's New Year's Eve celebrations, rather than being held on Mardi Gras day. Other groups had developed Mardi Gras parades, but the Civil War had brought them to a halt. Cain was in New Orleans in 1867 for the Fireman's Day parade. He stayed over until the next day which was Mardi Gras that year, saw the celebration in the streets, and he returned to Mobile determined to revive the spirits of the citizens and to create a similar celebration of Mardi Gras for the people. He conceived the fictional character of Chief Slacabamorinico (\\"slaka-BAM orin-ah-CO\\") while he was the city clerk at the city market. Dressed in costume with a plaid skirt and feathered headdress, Cain paraded through the city streets on Fat Tuesday in 1868, celebrating the day in front of the citizens of the city and Union Army troops. A band of fellow Confederate veterans (including Thomas Burke, Rutledge Parham, John Payne, John Bohanan, Barney O'Rourke, and John Maguire) later accompanied Joe Cain as \\"Old Slac\\" riding through town on a decorated coal wagon, playing horns and drums, parading and celebrating. The group became known as the \\"Lost Cause Minstrels Band\\" in Mobile. The first appearance of Joe Cain occurred the afternoon in the same year as the evening parade of the Order of Myths (OOM), the final parade each year.. Joe Cain was one of the founders of the New Year's Eve mystic society the T.D.S., and he built a tradition of Mardi Gras parades. Joe Cain, who had played Old Slac until 1879, died in 1904 and was buried in the fishing village of Bayou La Batre (Alabama). Julian Lee \\"Judy\\" Rayford arranged to have Joe Cain reburied in Mobile's Church Street Graveyard in 1966, and he established Joe Cain Day in 1967 by walking at the head of a jazz funeral down Government Street to the cemetery. Joe Cain's wife, Elizabeth Alabama Rabby Cain, died 3 years later, in 1907 at Bayou La Batre, and she is also re-buried, beside him. Joe and Elizabeth are two of the few, if only, people known to have been buried three times as both bodies were moved after the re-interment in the old Church Street Graveyard the following year to be nearer to his parents' graves. ==Gravesite== Joe Cain's gravestone in the Church Street Cemetery, Mobile, ALJoe Cain is buried in the Church Street Graveyard in downtown Mobile, Alabama. His gravestone carries the inscription: == Joe Cain Day == The Sunday before Fat Tuesday, Joe Cain Day is celebrated as part of the scheduled Mardi Gras celebrations in Mobile, with its center being the Joe Cain Procession (never called a parade). This has been called ‚ÄúThe People‚Äôs Parade‚Äù because it is performed by citizens without being run by a specific Mardi Gras krewe. Originally, anybody who showed up at the parade start on Sunday morning could join in with whatever makeshift float they could cobble together. Eventually, the sheer size and the city's desire to have all the Carnival parades conform to the same set of rules forced the organizers to limit the participants to a preset limit. The parade is preceded with the visit of the ‚ÄúCain's Merry Widows‚Äù to the gravesite of their ‚Äúdeparted husband‚Äù (described below). Julian Lee ‚ÄúJudy‚Äù Rayford established Joe Cain Day in 1967 by walking at the head of a jazz funeral, along with his beloved dog Rosie (the only dog to ever lead a Mardi Gras parade in Mobile) down Government Street to the Church Street Graveyard, where he had arranged to have Joe Cain and his wife reburied in 1966. When Joe Cain was disinterred from Bayou La Batre, Julian brought Joe Cain's skull back to Mobile in the pocket of his coat, and that is considered to be the first ‚Äúpassing of the feathers‚Äù to the next person to wear the headdress in Mardi Gras, as \\"Slacabamorinico, chief of the Chickasaw.\\" The feathers were passed in 1970 to Fireman J.B. \\"Red\\" Foster who, attired in Plains Indian fashion, led the procession for 16 years. He then passed the feathers, tomahawk and peace pipe to author, historian, public relations, marketing professional and pastor, Bennett Wayne Dean Sr. in 1985. Old Slac IV \\"hisself\\" marked his 30th anniversary under the feathers during Joe Cain Day in 2015 noting that he \\"was just getting started.\\" The feathers are always passed from \\"Chief to Chief\\" and it is his choice only - no other individual or any organization has any say in the selection of a new \\"Chief Slacabamorinico,\\" a tradition unique to Mobile and its Mardi Gras. The impression that the celebration had on a couple of visitors from California resulted in Joe Cain Days being officially recognized, in 1993, as a sister celebration by the Joe Cain Society of California in Nevada City, California each Mardi Gras.\\"Joe Cain Days, Nevada City\\" (description), Nevada County Things-to-Do, Nevada City, California, webpage: NCT-JCainDays . The Mardi Gras mystic society of \\"Cain‚Äôs Merry Widows\\" (a women's mystic society) was founded in 1974 in Mobile, Alabama. Each Mardi Gras, on Joe Cain Day (the Sunday before Fat Tuesday), members of this society dress in funereal black with veils, lay a wreath at Cain‚Äôs burial site in Church Street Graveyard to wail over their ‚Äúdeparted husband‚Äôs‚Äù grave, then travel to Joe Cain‚Äôs house on Augusta Street to offer a toast and eulogy to their ‚Äúbeloved Joe,‚Äú continuously arguing over which widow was his favorite. ==See also== * Mardi Gras in Mobile - main article about Mobile's Mardi Gras festival. * Cain's Merry Widows ==References== ==External links== * Cain's Merry Widows * * Museum of Mobile, history timeline of Mardi Gras * Mobile Chamber of Commerce, on Mardi Gras events (PDF file) Joe Cain Category:Carnival and Mardi Gras in Mobile, Alabama Category:People from Mobile, Alabama Category:1832 births Category:1904 deaths ","title":"Joe Cain"},{"id":"1268620","text":"The All-American Protectorate, Inc., was a right-wing political group incorporated in February 1963 in St. Louis County, Missouri, under the leadership of general chairman Lovell W.

The Metedeconk River flows from its U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed April 1, 2011 North and South Branches to their confluence at Forge Pond, where the river widens (up to just over ) and flows southeast for into Barnegat Bay. It contains both fresh and salt-water portions. Like many area streets, waterways and towns, Metedeconk is the original word or phrase used by the pre-European peoples to name themselves or to name themselves after their geography. Its name a direct reference to the Metedeconk Tribes who had two settlements, one on the North Side of the river bordering the Beaver-dam Creek in the region now called CedarCrofthttps://www.cedarcroftclub.org/page-1556464, and one on the south side.South Jersey: A History, 1664-1924, Volume 3 page 187 by Alfred Miller Heston ==Geographic relation to nearby water features== At its most eastern face the river meets the Barnegat Peninsula, a populated but narrow strip (less than wide) of New Jersey separating the Metedeconk from a direct connection with the Atlantic Ocean. Here, the river joins the Barnegat Bay to the south and the narrow, man-made Point Pleasant Canal to the north. This canal provides a convenient connection to the Manasquan River, which would otherwise be completely separated from the Metedeconk by about of land. The Manasquan River is directly connected to the Atlantic Ocean, as is Barnegat Bay. ==Interactions with ocean waters== The river is of the floodplain type and is tidal, being indirectly connected to the Atlantic Ocean through the Barnegat Bay and the Manasquan River. The Metedeconk's main oceanic interactions are through the Manasquan, via the Point Pleasant Canal. In fact, before the canal was opened in 1926, the Metedeconk and the upper part of the Barnegat Bay were mainly fresh water environments and non-tidal. Today, due to ocean tides, the waters of the Bay and the Manasquan are both inlets and outlets of the Metedeconk. Since the canal, the waters of the lower Metedeconk have been brackish to salty and the ecology of the area has changed considerably. A visual indication of the river's connection to the ocean is the cream to brown colored foam that sometimes collects where the Metedeconk's waves beat the sandy shores or manmade bulkheads. This foam consists of the microscopic organic material that naturally builds up in the presence of aquatic life; the process of filtering organics from water through wave-like action has been mechanized in most aquariums and is known there as foam fractionating. As of October 29, 2012, due to the effects of Hurricane Sandy hitting New Jersey, an inlet opened between Barnegat Bay and the Atlantic Ocean at the river's east end, the storm having obliterated the dunes, roads, and houses that once blocked off the river from the ocean. Thus the Metedeconk technically opened to the Atlantic Ocean at the base of the Route 528 bridge, whose east end was washed away by the storm, until repairs could be attempted to the peninsula and the bridge. By February 2013, peninsula and bridge repair had effectively reclosed the inlet and reopened the bridge to limited traffic. ==Notable areas== The river west of Forge Pond (where it forks into North and South Branches) is known as the upper section, while the river east of Forge Pond is known as the lower section. The upper section is popular with paddle boaters. The lower section, being deeper, wider and wavier, is more popular with sailboats and powerboats. A notable section of the lower Metedeconk is Windward Beach, a small beach sanctioned for public recreation. On the upper Metedeconk, the river flows through the fresh-water Lake Shenandoah, where a popular county park holds great attraction. ==Importance to local communities== The Metedeconk River is important to local wildlife and the surrounding human populations, providing a place of recreation as it winds through the townships of Brick, Freehold Township, Howell, Jackson, Wall Township, Lakewood and Millstone Township. It is the primary source of drinking water for Brick, Point Pleasant Beach and Point Pleasant Borough. As such, it was classified as a Category 1 (C1) River, the highest level of protection offered rivers by the state of New Jersey. ==Wildlife== With both fresh-water and tidal wetland portions, the Metedeconk supports an extremely diverse range of wildlife. Wild rice grows along the banks along some portions of the Metedeconk. Bald eagles have been sighted there, and ospreys nest atop nearby trees and industrial towers and come to the river to fish. Sections of the river and surrounding estuary habitat are protected as parts of New Jersey‚Äôs extensive Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge, because of the river‚Äôs great significance to migratory birds and waterfowl. Mammals of the Metedeconk include those typically found at New Jersey rivers, such as river otters and beavers. Aquatic life includes many species of fish and jellyfish, including one species whose bodies are about two-inches long and appear clear in daylight, but glow blue by night. ==Hurricane Sandy== In October 2012, under the influence of Hurricane Sandy, ocean waters directly infiltrated the south branch of the river at the area of the Metedeconk Bridge. Immediate impact of the hurricane on the river included a change in salinity of the river's ecosystem, as well as elevated contaminate levels caused by relevant water treatment facilities going temporarily off-line. The long-term impact of Hurricane Sandy on the river and its ecosystem remains an area of study. ==See also== *List of New Jersey rivers ==References== ==External links== *Nautical Chart of the Metedeconk River *Map of lower Metedeconk and surrounding area.

As one of the youngest generals in the Revolutionary Army, he was known for the successful assault on the Spanish barracks in the municipality of Paombong, his victory on the first phase Battle of Quingua and his last stand at the Battle of Tirad Pass during the Philippine-American War. Because of his youth, he became known as the \\"Boy General\\". He was also known as a ladies man and was described by National Artist for Literature Nick Joaquin as the \\"Byron of Bulacan\\". ==Early life and education== Bulakan Born on November 14, 1875 to Fernando H. del Pilar and Felipa Sempio of Bulacan, Bulacan, the fifth among six siblings. His siblings were Mar√≠a de la Paz del Pilar (b.1865), Andrea del Pilar (b. 1866), Pablo H. del Pilar (b. 1869), Julian H. del Pilar (b. 1872), and Jacinto H. del Pilar (b. 1878). He was part of the del Pilar family (more properly Hilario del Pilar; Hilario was the original surname before the Claveria naming reforms and was contracted to \\"H.\\") of the principalia, whose members included his uncles, lawyer-turned- propagandist Marcelo H. del Pilar, editor-in-chief of Diariong Tagalog and La Solidaridad, as well as the priest Toribio H. del Pilar, who was exiled in Guam for his alleged involvement in the 1872 Cavite Mutiny. The del Pilar clan was distantly related to the Gatmaitans. Although principalia, Gregorio del Pilar's branch was relatively poor. It was said that del Pilar had to hawk meat pies as a child to survive. As a child, he completed his primary education under Maestros Monico Estrella and Romualdo Sempio before being sent to study in Manila. He was enrolled at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila at the age of 15, where he was rated good in Latin, Greek, Spanish and French, middling in philosophy, and excellent in arithmetic and algebra. During his studies in the Ateneo, he stayed in the house of his fraternal aunt, Hilaria H. del Pilar, and her husband, the propagandist Deodato Arellano. He helped his uncle distribute revolutionary pamphlets and other materials. There was one incident in Malolos, where del Pilar stole copies of the book Cuesteones de sumo interes from the parish priest, Father Felipe Garc√≠a, who had a habit of distributing counter-revolutionary materials after mass. These books were set to be distributed after the mass. Del Pilar removed the book covers and pasted the pamphlets inside before distributing them after. Del Pilar finished his bachelor of arts in March 1896 and had intended to enroll at the School of Arts and Trades and study to become a maestro de obras; however when the revolution broke out in August of that year his plans of further study were thwarted. Del Pilar quickly went home to Bulacan and enlisted himself for military service under Colonel Vicente Enr√≠quez. ==Philippine Revolution== At the onset of the revolution, and in response to reports of \\"successive triumphs\\" in Cavite, some 3,000 revolutionary forces marched to seize the town of Paombong, Bulacan, forming a military government. Del Pilar was among those who marched towards Paombong, although there are also rumors of him being present during the Cry of Balintawak. Del Pilar was eventually assigned to the forces of Eus√©bio Roque (also known as Mang S√©bio) in Kakarong de Sili, a fort near the town of Pandi. On New Year's day, 1897, del Pilar participated in the defense of Kakarong de Sili, managing to escape with only nine others before the Spanish overran the fort. He recounts in his diary: His courage and bravery in that action won him recognition and a promotion to the rank of lieutenant. He eventually left Roque's unit - Roque was sold out to the Spanish by his own soldiers and executed on February 1897, and del Pilar began to make his way to Imus, Cavite, reaching as far as Montalban in February. He eventually returned to Bulacan and joined Adriano Gatmait√°n's army, being promoted to captain in the process. As captain, del Pilar managed feats of bravery. He once managed to single-handedly ambush a priest and his escort of cazadores from Mambog on their way to Malolos. He shot of the cazadores which prompted the rest to flee. This act netted him several Mauser rifles and four sacks of coins, which he distributed to his troops. He decreed that married men be given 50 pesos each, unmarried ones 25 pesos, and the remaining money be sent to Manila to buy a blanket and a cloak for each soldier. Flag of Gregorio del Pilar On September 3, 1897, del Pilar executed an attack on the Spanish garrison in the town of Paombong. He and ten other men slipped into town in the night and fell upon the cazadores in the basement of the convent during Sunday mass. Del Pilar himself was stationed in the plaza, firing at the second story of the convent to prevent any men from approaching from the windows. They were eventually able to capture 14 Mauser rifles. Other versions of the raid vary, however. Some tellings talk about how del Pilar and his men slipped into town dressed as women, while other versions have them disguised as cazadores. Del Pilar's success in Paombong caught the attention of Emilio Aguinaldo, who promoted the captain to a lieutenant colonel, eventually earning his trust and being let into his inner circle of confidants. Artemio Ricarte noted that Del Pilar's feat in Paombong ‚Äúexalted him to the horns of the moon.\\" Del Pilar celebrated his promotion to lieutenant colonel by creating a distinctive flag for himself and his battalion: a tricolor with a blue triangle at the hoist, red stripe on top and black at the bottom, taking cues from the Cuban flag. He first unfurled this flag during his participation in the Battle of Pasong Balite (modern-day Polo, Bulacan) in 1897. Due to his closeness to Aguinaldo, del Pilar became one of the signatories of the provisional constitution of the Republic of Biak-na-Bato in November 1897. When negotiations with the Spanish took place in the which concluded with the signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, Aguinaldo took del Pilar with him to exile in Hong Kong. ==Second phase and the Philippine-American War== The exiles in Hong Kong organized a Supreme Council, electing del Pilar to a position second only to Tom√°s Mascardo. Aguinaldo's confidence in del Pilar grew such that he wrote the following about him: When Aguinaldo was supposed to go to Europe, he took only del Pilar and Colonel Jos√© Leyba with him. The trip ended in Singapore, where Aguinaldo conferred with American consul E. Spencer Pratt, learning of the American declaration of war against Spain. Spurred by this, Aguinaldo and the other exiles decided to return to the Philippines to restart the revolution. Statue of Gregorio del Pilar in Plaza del Pilar, Bulacan, Bulacan After the Americans defeated the Spanish in the Battle of Manila Bay, Aguinaldo, del Pilar, and other exiled leaders returned to the Philippines. Aguinaldo named del Pilar Dictator of Bulacan and Nueva Ecija provinces, an honor Aguinaldo would not confer to anybody else. On del Pilar's return to the Philippines, he set out to liberating his home province of Bulacan, eventually accepting Spanish surrender on June 24, 1898. Del Pilar was then called to relieve the wounded General Pantaleon Garc√≠a and continue operations in Caloocan, ultimately succeeded on August 13, 1898. The Revolutionary Congress was then inaugurated on September 15, 1898 and del Pilar became in charge of the military parade. He was promoted to brigadier- general after this event. When the Philippine-American War broke out in February 1899, following the cession of the Philippines by Spain to the United States in the Treaty of Paris of 1898, del Pilar fought alongside General Antonio Luna in Manila, suffering heavy casualties. Del Pilar's relationships with his fellow generals were contentious at best. General Jos√© Alejandrino wrote of del Pilar: Historical marker of the Battle of Quingua (now Plaridel) Another story between Luna and del Pilar have the two riding together on the front, with Luna so absorbed in what he was saying that he did not notice they were moving into a danger zone. Del Pilar did notice but did not back off because Luna had not. After Manila, del Pilar and his troops moved to Bulacan. Major General Venancio Concepci√≥n was placed under his command but the two did not get along. After the fall of Baliuag each blamed the other. Concepci√≥n was eventually moved under the command of Luna in Pampanga. Del Pilar, for his part, led his troops to a victory over Major Franklin Bell in the first phase of the Battle of Quingua (modern-day Plaridel, Bulacan) on April 23, 1899. During the battle, his forces repelled a cavalry charge and killed American Colonel John M. Stotsenburg,. The Americans were, however, reinforced during the second phase of the Battle and the Filipino forces were forced to retreat. Del Pilar then participated in the Battle of Calumpit alongside General Luna. Luna, however, had left the battle to punish General Tom√°s Mascardo for insubordination, leaving del Pilar with the defense of the Bagbag river. On Luna's return, the Americans had already succeeded in penetrating the Filipino lines and they were forced to retreat. On June 4, 1899, del Pilar joined Aguinaldo in San Isidro, Nueva Ecija and received orders to capture Antonio Luna, dead or alive, on charges of high treason. It is said that had Luna not come down himself to Cabanatuan and assassinated by the Kawit Batallion from his headquarters in Bayambang that del Pilar would have gone down as Luna's killer. Del Pilar and Aguinaldo then descended upon General Concepcion's headquarters in Pampanga to relieve him of his position, as he was suspected to be partisan to the assassinated general. Troops surrounded Concepcion's headquarters and sentries were replaced by the presidential guards. Concepci√≥n was then relieved of his command on suspicions of a conspiracy being plotted against Aguinaldo. Del Pilar was then tasked with taking possession of Luna's old headquarters in Bayambang, and of liquidating Luna's former aides-de-camp, Manuel and Jos√© Bernal. He arrived in Bayambang on June 7 and managed to capture a younger Bernal brother, Angel, who was arrested and maltreated. Manuel Bernal was captured a few days later, located in the house of the Nable Jos√© family. Remedios or Dolores, daughters of the family, was said to be one of del Pilar's last loves. Manuel was tortured in the presence of his younger brother Angel by del Pilar and his brother Julian del Pilar for a week before he was killed. Jos√© Bernal was captured soon after, taken to Angeles, Pampanga and murdered by soldiers thereafter. After this, del Pilar was given command in Pangasinan, where he stayed for five months from June to November 1899. He was also posted in Pangasinan to defend against a possible mutiny from Ilocanos outraged with Luna's assassination, as well as to defend against the Guardia de Honor, a millenarian cult fashioned after the Katipunan. During this time, the American forces were unusually quiet but the revolutionary government failed to capitalize on this opportunity. Del Pilar himself, was engaged in a number of love affairs. In a letter sent to a relative in Bulacan, he asked for the finest of riding boots, while he ordered the best horses in Dagupan to show off his horsemanship. By November, Tarlac had fallen to the Americans and Aguinaldo was moving northward towards Bayambang. From Bayambang, the fleeing government led an expedition to Santa Barbara. Del Pilar, at the time, had 2,000 troops: 1,000 in the del Pilar Brigade, 350 in the Joven column, 400 in the Kawit Battalion, 100 in the Corps of Lancers, and two vanguard companies. del Pilar led the expedition northward towards Ilocos. During this time he carried a briefcase containing a girl's letter and a lock of hair, from one of his loves in Bulacan. ==Tirad Pass and death== Gregorio del Pilar's tomb in Bulacan In November 1899, Aguinaldo's party had reached the town of Concepci√≥n and climbed the peak of Mount Tirad. Del Pilar ordered three lines of trenches be dug up on the pass and had the \\"pick of all the men that can be spared\\" on orders from Aguinaldo. While Aguinaldo and the rest were in Cervantes, Ilocos Sur, Del Pilar rode to the rearguard to ensure the safety of the retreat. Word had come that the Americans were advancing on Tirad Pass in an effort to cut off Aguinaldo from the Tinio Brigade situated on the Abra River. The U.S. Army 33rd Infantry Regiment, under Major Peyton C. March took Concepci√≥n on December 1 and began to scale Tirad Pass the next day. Although they had difficulty in attacking the Filipino position, they saw an opening with the aid of a Tingguian Igorot named Januario Galut. The Americans then devised a plan to flank the entrenched defenders from the village of Lingay at the foot of the pass, and from the peak. The combined attack surprised the defenders and the engagement barely lasted six hours. Del Pilar was killed in the skirmish from a shot in the neck, killing him instantly. Of the 60 defenders, only eight remained. After the battle, Del Pilar's belongings were taken by the Americans as war trophies, including a handkerchief embroidered with the name Dolores, a locket with a picture of a girl, and his diary. His last entry was: Reports of Del Pilar's death varied. Two newsmen, John McCutcheon and Richard Henry Little, and a local newspaper called The Manila Freedom reported accounts which captured the imaginations of American and Filipino readers. McCutcheon and Little both reported how del Pilar was the last to fall; how he continually urged his men during the battle to fight on, appealing to their sense of love for their native land; how he refused to turn away on his white horse until all the men had retreated; and his death when a sharpshooter got the better of him. The Manila Freedom wrote this of Del Pilar: Filipino accounts of Del Pilar's death corroborate each other and are less glamorous. Del Pilar's aide-de-camp, Vicente Enr√≠quez, writes: Lieutenant Telesforo Carrasco also recounted: Del Pilar's body lay unburied for days, exposed to the elements. While retracing the trail, an American officer, Lt. Dennis P. Quinlan, gave the body a traditional U.S. military burial. Upon Del Pilar's tombstone, Quinlan inscribed, \\"An Officer and a Gentleman\\". In 1930, Del Pilar's body was exhumed and was identified by dental records. ==Personal life== Del Pilar was known for his various relationships during the war. He was reported to have courted almost half a dozen girls, including Neneng Rodrigo, the daughter of Bulacan's civil governor, who has his first love; a sister of Col. Jos√© Leyba; a woman named Poleng, and Felicidad Aguinaldo, the sister of Emilio Aguinaldo. It has been asserted that a woman named Remedios Nable Jos√©, a daughter of Don Mariano Nable Jos√© from Dagupan, was del Pilar's last love. It was said that Nable Jos√© and del Pilar were almost married, but Nable Jos√© rejected del Pilar's advances, partly due to his reputation as a playboy. Though Nable Jos√©‚Äôs claim is based solely on an interview of her, there still remained a glaring lack of third-party sources to verify her story. Some are still speculating that her sister, Dolores, was the general's actual last love as there were numbers of third-party resources name her as the one. First, John McCutcheon, the war correspondent that was with the American troops at Tirad Pass. In an article published by the Boston Evening Transcript, McCutcheon details that Gregorio del Pilar and Dolores Nable Jos√© were set to be married around mid-November 1899. However, Aguinaldo‚Äôs order of a hasty retreat in early November caused the wedding to be postponed, and ultimately, to be canceled altogether. He also mentions the handkerchief found on del Pilar‚Äôs body to be embroidered with Dolores‚Äô name, and that a number of the letters retrieved from his person were from her. There is good reason to believe in the authenticity of McCutcheon‚Äôs account. For one, McCutcheon knew del Pilar previously, having interviewed him multiple times throughout the war. For another, he was with the soldiers that looted del Pilar‚Äôs body, and would have actually seen the spoils himself. He also released more articles that consistently named Dolores, where she could be mentioned. Had he been mistaken, he would have corrected himself in a later article, but the reports did not change.. Second, Isaac Cruz Jr.‚Äôs biography of Gregorio del Pilar, General Gregorio H. Del Pilar: Idol of the Revolution, includes statements from Tirad Pass survivors that he was able to interview before they passed on. Lt. Jos√© Enr√≠quez recounted that Maj. March showed them some of the del Pilar‚Äôs belongings in his possession, and asked explicitly for Dolores Nable Jos√©. Additionally, Captain Isidro Wenceslao mentioned that Dolores was in del Pilar‚Äôs thoughts during his last meeting with Aguinaldo. Aside from being two of the only survivors from the Tirad Pass, both men were particularly close to the del Pilar. Enr√≠quez was the younger brother of Vicente Enr√≠quez and Anacleto Enr√≠quez, who were del Pilar‚Äôs aide-de-camp and supporter respectively. The children of both families were neighbors and childhood friends. Meanwhile, Isidro Wenceslao was part of the famed \\"Seven Musketeers of Pitpitan\\", a group of young men led by del Pilar that initially joined Maestrong Sebio‚Äôs forces at Kakarong de Sili. If anyone had been privy to the thoughts and feelings of del Pilar, especially in matters so important to him as love, it would be these men. Third, ‚ÄúNandaragupan : the story of a coastal city and Dagupan Bangus‚Äù names Dolores Nable Jos√© as the Dagupan belle that del Pilar fell in love with during his stay in Pangasinan. After del Pilar‚Äôs death, Dolores seems to have disappeared from the records, as there is no mention of her in the 1916 court case where her other siblings and father appear. Despite all this, del Pilar's love life still remains a mystery to all historians. ==Memorials== \\"BRP Gregorio del Pilar (PF-15)\\" a Philippine Navy warship to be named after Gregorio del Pilar *Fort Del Pilar, home of the Philippine Military Academy in Baguio, is named after him. * In 1944, the Japanese- sponsored Philippine republic of President Jose P.

Most of his work for the NOI was in St. Louis, Missouri and Cleveland, Ohio. He was wounded when a violent factional dispute arose in St. Louis in the 1960s. In the 1970s he became a follower of W. D. Muhammad's Sunni faction of the NOI and established a mosque in Cleveland. ==Early life== He was born Clyde Jones in Canton, Mississippi. He served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War. After his service, he moved to Dayton, Ohio, and then to Detroit where he worked as a machinist. He served in the army during the Korean war, in which he was badly wounded. He joked that he was cured when a nurse denied him morphine, and he jumped out of bed to chase her. He subsequently joined the police force in Detroit.Pinkard, Cliff, \\"Clyde Rahman, 79, founder of African-American mosque in Cleveland, dies\\", North East Ohio Media Group, February 17, 2009. ==NOI activist== While in Detroit, Clyde was first introduced to the Nation of Islam through \\"people talking about it in a poolroom.\\" He became \\"Clyde X\\". In 1958 he was sent to St. Louis in the service of the NOI to establish Temple No. 28 at 1434 N. Grand Avenue. When he arrived in St. Louis the local media described him as \\"a glowering moon-faced giant... on the fleshy side of 200 pounds... mild mannered, polite, and diplomatic.\\" They also described him as \\"too emotional,\\" a \\"rabble rouser,\\" and \\"a haranguer.\\" Clyde X helped to launch many business ventures with Temple No. 28, opening a restaurant called the \\"Shabbaz\\"; laundry; record store; dress shop; and a grocery along Grand Avenue, leading some in the community to call the area \\"Little Egypt.\\" ==Violent splits== In 1961, Clyde X's Temple No. 28 saw an internal split, with members leaving to join the offshoot \\"Islamic Service Church\\" headquartered at 1902 Union Boulevard. Elijah Muhammad, displeased with the split, sent the Supreme Commander of the Fruit of Islam to try to broker a reconciliation. No such agreement could be reached, and the two temples were officially separated. The split resulted in sporadic incidents of violence, with Clyde X, Timothy Hoffman, and John Moore being shot outside the Shabazz restaurant in 1966. The principal suspect was Hoffman's brother Andrew, who was subsequently arrested. While Clyde and Hoffman were not seriously hurt, Moore died as a result of his wounds. Nevertheless, Clyde had a bullet lodged in his skull for the rest of his life. One year later, on January 9, 1967, Clyde X's home was bombed, but he was unhurt. Andrew Hoffman was again suspected. Two days after this Andrew Hoffman and his wife were both shot to death outside their home. An associate of his, Roy Tyson, was found beaten to death. No charges were ever brought in the deaths. ==Later career== In the mid 1970s, after the death of Elijah Muhammad, Clyde X supported the reforms of Warith Deen Mohammed's faction, which sought to align the NOI with mainstream Sunni Islam. He became a leader in W.D. Mohammed's new organization, the American Society of Muslims. He moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where he worked with Cleveland's Muslim community using the name Imam Clyde Rahman. Rahman became W.D. Muhammad's principal representative in Cleveland, building the Masjid Bilal mosque there in 1983.Edward E. Curtis, Encyclopedia of Muslim-American History, Infobase Publishing, 2010, p.118. He adopted an ecumenical approach saying \\"Our Koran does not even hint that we should take innocent life, and it is a disgrace to Islam for any Muslim to support terrorism.\\" He served on the board of a number of local civic groups. In his last years he suffered from complications of Alzheimer's disease.

This is the first Time song to be released both live and featuring The Time as a band, rather than primarily Prince with Morris Day on vocals. The title of the upbeat number refers to a dance in which the arms are flapped, mimicking a bird's wings. Morris Day also squawks throughout the song. The song suggests that by \\"doing the bird\\", one can overcome their troubles. \\"The Bird\\" is a funk-rock offering, using both a drum machine and live drumming by Jellybean Johnson. Guitar takes the background for a funk effect, while keyboards play a dominant role in the song. After the main lyrics, there is an extended instrumental section to allow the band to dance. A \\"Dance Remix\\" of the song was released as a 12\\" single. The B-side to the single was the rocker, \\"My Drawers\\". The song has become a signature number for the band and continues to be played in every Time concert to this day.

It is also known by the synonym Achras cainito. In Vietnam, it is called V√∫ S·ªØa (literally: milky breast). In Malayalam it is called \\"Swarnapathry\\" meaning '[the tree with] golden leaves'. In Cambodia, this fruit is called \\"Plae Teuk Dos\\" which means milk fruit due to its milky juices inside.In Hong Kong , it is called \\"ÁâõÂ•∂Êûú\\" , In China , it is called \\"ÈáëÊòüÊûú\\" The leaves are evergreen, alternate, simple oval, entire, 5‚Äì15 cm long; the underside shines with a golden color when seen from a distance. The tiny flowers are purplish white and have a sweet fragrant smell. The tree is also hermaphroditic (self-fertile). It produces a strong odor. ==Fruits== Fruits, usually purple, are also available in green or red The fruit is globose and typically measures from 2 to 3 inches in diameter. When ripe, it usually has purple skin with a faint green area appearing around the calyx. A radiating star pattern is visible in the pulp. Greenish-white and yellow-fruited cultivars are sometimes available. The skin is rich in latex, and both it and the rind are not edible. The flattened seeds are light brown and hard. It is a seasonal fruit bearing tree. The fruits are used as a fresh dessert fruit; it is sweet and often served chilled. Infusions of the leaves have been used against diabetes and articular rheumatism. The fruit has antioxidant properties.Luo X.D., Basile M.J., Kennelly E.J.,\\"Polyphenolic antioxidants from the fruits of Chrysophyllum cainito L.

The fruit also exists in three colors, dark purple, greenish brown and yellow. The purple fruit has a denser skin and texture while the greenish brown fruit has a thin skin and a more liquid pulp; the yellow variety is less common and difficult to find. A number of closely related species, also called star apples, are grown in Africa including C. albidum and C. africanum.

Members explored free jazz and loosely associated themselves with the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) and the Black Artists' Group (BAG) collective. It was formed in 1971 with the idea that performers could perform in the ensemble, without restrictions as to the performer's race. Additionally, public funding had ended for musical associations that were suspected of having connections with radical organizations. It disbanded in 1977.[ Allmusic history] Human Arts Ensemble co-founder, saxophonist James Marshall, continues to pursue the vision of HAE to this day in Tucson, Arizona. Originally, after its activity in St. Louis, Jim and his then wife (and HAE co-founder) Carol, moved to Oregon to continue the project there in the context of a musician's commune. Unfortunately, neither the marriage (they're still friends) nor the commune lasted. However, when Jim moved to Tucson, Arizona, he continued to pursue his vision of free form and soulful jazz improvisation. Jim worked closely with another partner from the St. Louis days‚ÄîAjule Eneke Rutlin, who died suddenly in 2006. Ajule had been associated with the Black Artists Group, which inspired the foundation of HAE, and was also a founding member of HAE. The Human Arts Ensemble was not only committed to the beauty that can emerge from humans interacting freely and without restriction, but it also consciously, from the beginning, saw its music as a direct, soulful contradiction to a world of hate produced by racism, consumerism, greed, and war. To this day, the new incarnation of HAE that exists in Tucson still maintains that vision. During the 90's Human Arts Ensemble played benefits to raise money for Iraqi civilians suffering under the effect of US/UN sanctions, and HAE members have regularly performed at anti-war protests. ==Discography== *1972: Whisper of Dharma (Freedom Records) *1973: Under the Sun (Freedom) *1974: Streets Of St. Louis as Charles Bobo Shaw with Human Arts Ensemble (Moers Music) *1978: Live In Trio Performance Vols. 1 & 2 (Circle Records (Germany)) *1978: Junk Trap as Charles Bobo Shaw with Human Arts Ensemble (Black Saint) ==References== ==External links== Category:Musical collectives Category:Freedom Records artists Category:American jazz ensembles Category:Arts organizations based in Missouri Category:Musical groups from St. Louis Category:Musical groups established in 1971 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1977 Category:1971 establishments in Missouri Category:1977 disestablishments in Missouri Category:Jazz musicians from Missouri ","title":"Human Arts Ensemble"},{"id":"1268700","text":"Ertar Coat of Arms 1st Light Years Readercon Ertar is an alternative reality project, created by a group of Czech science fiction fans, led by D.Cap.

He was especially noted for his work in multisectoral (input-output) economics and for his concept of the multi-level economy, a description of how the planned economy of the Soviet Union actually worked.After his death, his scientific works were collected and published in Russian in three volumes by Nauka, the publishing house of the Academy of Sciences. In translation, the titles of the volumes are, 1\\\\. Theory and Methodology of Investigation of a Multilevel Economy (1997) 2, Forecasts of the Development of the National Economy and Variants of Economic Policy (1997) 3\\\\. Priorities of Structural Policies and Experience of Reforms (1999) Youth and Education He was born in Chita in eastern Siberia, 300 miles east of Lake Baikal and 100 miles north of China. His father worked in a repair shop for railroad cars. This work would have exempted him from military service in World War II, but he chose to enlist and served in a tank crew. After the war, he was stationed in Germany for two years, where he was joined by his wife, ten-year-old Yuri, and a younger sister. After two years, they returned to the Ukraine. From there Yuri was able to enter Moscow State University in 1953. From his first year, he began to study Chinese and the economy of China. After graduation, he was sent in November 1957 to study economics at the People's University in Beijing. He graduated there in 1960 and returned to Moscow at just the moment when relations between China and the Soviet Union dramatically worsened. Despite his exceptional knowledge of Chinese institutions and language, he could find no appropriate work that used them. Nevertheless, during the rest of his life, he followed events in China closely, wrote about them, and taught courses on the economy of China at Moscow State University. Professional Career After six months as a translator for Intourist, he accepted a job in the newly organized Economic Research Institute (–ù–ò–≠–ò) in Gosplan. the State Planning Commission. There he came to recognize the importance of forecasting and envisioning of the future. In 1973, he and several other members of this Institute moved to the Central Economic- Mathematical Institute (–¶–≠–ú–ò) of the Academy of Sciences, where he was a deputy director and head of a laboratory. In 1985, he became a Deputy Director of the newly organized Institute of Economic Forecasting in the Academy of Sciences. Following the death in 1987 of the founding director of this Institute, A. I. Anchishkin, Yaremenko became its director and served in this capacity until his sudden death of a heart attack that began in his office. In 1987 he was made a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences; and in 1994, a full member. In 1990 -1991, he served on the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In the 1980s, the Five Year Plans were set in 20-year outlooks on economic, scientific and technical development which were primarily the work of Yaremenko. His most fundamental contribution to economics was the working out of the theory of the multilevel economy. In this theory, different levels of the economy have access to resources of different quality. There had been various economic theories of socialism. Yaremenko's work, however, was unique in describing theoretically and analytically how it actually worked in the Soviet Union. Yaremenko was one of the principal economic advisers to Mikhail Gorbachev, last president of the USSR. Yaremenko warned that simply discontinuing central planning and opening the country to foreign trade would lead to collapse of consumer goods sectors which could not compete with imports. Rather, the system of priorities should first be used to transform the economy's structure to something approximating that of market economy. This advice was not heeded, and the consequences were much as he had anticipated. In the 1990s, he was sharply critical of the policies adopted by the Russian government. He was not at all opposed to an orderly transition to a market economy but felt that the ‚Äúshock therapy‚Äù approach was needlessly costly. Throughout his professional career, he was much concerned with sources of information on the economy. On weekends, he often went to the Lenin library to see what the technical journals had to offer about the economic situation in various industries. In the 1990s, he engaged a sociologist, S. A. Belonovski√Ø, to interview plant managers around the country. In 1993 and again in 1995, Belonovski√Ø interviewed Yaremenko. After his death, these interviews were edited by Belonovski√Ø and G. A. Yaremenko into a book, Economic Conversations, which appeared in 1998. They afford a unique and altogether remarkable commentary on the dramatic events in the Russian economy during the first half of the 1990s.

The first day was devoted to analysis of the current economic situation; the second, to economic modeling; and the third, to studies on the economy of China.

The Bottom is a black neighborhood on the hill above the fictional town of Medallion, Ohio. In the first section of the novel, the origin story of the Bottom is revealed as well as how it got its name: a white farmer promised freedom and a piece of Bottom land to his slave if he would perform some difficult chores for him. Upon completion, the farmer regrets his end of the bargain. Freedom was easy, the farmer had no objection to that, but he did not want to give up the land. He tells the slave he was very sorry that he had to give him valley land, for he had hoped to give him a piece of the bottom land. The slave said he thought valley land was bottom land, to which the master said land on the hill, not the valley, was bottom land, rich and fertile\\" (Morrison 5). This is an obviously untrue, and slavery was never practiced in Ohio, but it is the story that black people told to illuminate the fact that white people's racism and lies have created this topsy turvy world in which up is down and down is up. \\"The white people lived on the rich valley floor... and the blacks populated the hills above it, taking small consolation in the fact that every day they could literally look down on the white folks\\" (5). The story is organized by chronological chapters labeled with years. In \\"1919,\\" the first named character, handsome Shadrack, a previous resident of the Bottom, returns from World War I a shattered man, suffering from shell shock or PTSD and unable to accept the world he used to belong in. Living in the outskirts of town and attempting to create order in his life, he develops methods such as keeping his shack in hospital-grade neatness. Another method is the invention of National Suicide Day, which exists on January 3rd to counter and compartmentalize the constant death he saw at war, and is essentially invitation for anyone that plans to die within the next year, to die on that day. Never assimilating, he curses even at children and whites, has regular acts of indecency, but also does odd jobs and sells fish to the townspeople and is begrudgingly woven into the urban fabric, which is this town's version of acceptance. In \\"1920\\" and \\"1921,\\" the narrator contrasts the families of the children Nel Wright and Sula Peace, who both grow up with no father figure. Nel, the product of a mother knee deep in social conventions, grows up in a stable home. Nel is initially torn between the rigid conventionality of her mother Helene Wright, who dislikes Sula's family instantly, and her inherent curiosity with the world, which she discovers on a trip. Her vow to venture out when she is older is juxtaposed by the reader being informed that not once did she leave the Bottom after that trip. This experience ultimately prompts Nel to begin a friendship with Sula. The Peace family is the opposite: she lives with her grandmother Eva and her mother Hannah, both of whom are seen by the town as eccentric, loose, yet Hannah was genuinely loved by all men, and Eva was very respected by all women. Their house serves as a home for three informally adopted boys and a steady stream of boarders. The extremely strained relationship between Hannah and Eva is revealed. Despite their differences, Sula and Nel become fiercely attached to each other in adolescent friendship. They share every part of their lives. This includes a memory of an accidental traumatic event; One day, they playfully swing a neighborhood boy, Chicken Little, around by his hands. Sula loses her grip and he falls into a nearby river and drowns. They do not tell anyone of the event, and though Sula grieves with guilt, Nel feels a light happiness, which is implicitly revealed to be unspoken pride, because she has secretly decided that the event is Sula's fault and that she does not share the blame at all. What complicates things is Shadrack's shack, which has a direct view of the incident. To find out if he saw, Sula visits it alone and is surprised at its orderliness, but she is unable to ask the question through her tears. He comforts her and she runs away, accidentally leaving her belt, which Shadrack hangs on his wall as a sole ornament and memorandum of his only visitor. One day, Hannah tries to light a fire outside and her dress catches fire. Eva sees this happening from upstairs and jumps out the window in an attempt to smother the flames to save her daughter's life. An ambulance comes, but Hannah dies en route to the hospital, and her mother is injured as well. The incident proves Eva's fierce love for her daughter despite previous tension. Sula, however, had stood on the porch and watched her mother burn. Other residents of the Bottom suggest perhaps Sula was stunned by the incident, but Eva believes she stood and watched because she was \\"interested\\". Nel chooses to marry, which implicitly breaks the bond of the girls who promised to share everything. Sula follows a wildly divergent path and lives a life of ardent independence and total disregard for social conventions. Shortly after Nel's wedding, Sula leaves the Bottom for a period of 10 years. She has many affairs and attends college. When she returns to the Bottom and to Nel, now a conventional wife and mother, they reconcile briefly. The rest of the town, however, regard Sula as the very personification of evil for her blatant disregard of social conventions. Their hatred in part rests upon Sula's affairs with the husbands of townspeople, though Hannah, did this very thing with much less criticism. The hate is crystallized when the husbands start a rumor that Sula slept with white men, successfully turning the whole town against her, though it is implied at the end that Sula was not hurt by anyone's opinions except Nel's. Ironically, the community's labeling of Sula as evil actually improves their own lives, as her presence in the community gives them the impetus to live harmoniously with one another, as well as treat each other better. For instance, Sula's affairs give the wives a reason to soothe the bruisen egos of their husbands, while Sula's lack of family at her age is scorned by all the women and causes them to be better mothers. What confuses the town even more is how Shadrack, who treats everyone poorly, always treats Sula with chivalry. The final nail in the coffin of their friendship is an affair Sula has with Nel's husband, Jude, who subsequently abandons Nel. Just before Sula dies in 1940, they reconcile half- heartedly. With Sula's death, the harmony that had reigned in the town quickly dissolves, as the couples begin bickering again and the women complain about motherhood again. Sula dies alone, and the community doesn't even attend her funeral. Shadrack, whose PTSD has faded enough for loneliness to crawl back in, is the only one saddened by her death. Nel never remarries and instead smothers her children, repeating every one of her mother's mistakes. The Bottom slowly dissolves after Sula's death, becoming a different place. Nel visits Eva out of cordiality in 1965 in a home for old people, where Eva tells her that she knew about her and Sula drowning Chicken Little. Nel replies that the blame was just on Sula, but later realizes that the girl's shared everything back then. Nel says goodbye to Sula at her gravestone, finally realizing that all this time she thought she was missing Jude, when really it was Sula, and cries in grief as she recalls the years spent without her. ==Characters== *Sula Peace: the childhood best friend of Nel, whose return to the Bottom disrupts the whole community. The main reason for Sula's strangeness is her defiance of gender norms and traditional morality, symbolized by the birthmark \\"that spread from the middle of the lid toward the eyebrow, shaped something like a stemmed rose,\\"Morrison, Toni. Sula. New York: Vintage International, 2004. which, according to some psychoanalytic readings, is a dual symbol with both phallic and vaginal resonance.Hirsch, Marianne. The Mother/Daughter Plot: Narrative, Psychoanalysis, Feminism. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1989. *Eva Peace: Sula's grandmother, who is missing one leg. Though the circumstances are never fully explained, it is suggested that she purposely put it under a train in order to collect insurance money to support her three young children after her husband left her. She has a particular relation with her children. She passes on to Hannah and then Sula a need for male attention. *BoyBoy: Sula's grandfather, who leaves Eva for another woman. *Hannah Peace: Sula's mother; Eva's eldest daughter. Hannah is a promiscuous and care-free woman who later burns to death in front of her mother and daughter. Her daughter Sula witnessed the fire but did nothing and her mother tried to save her by jumping on top of her from her bedroom window. *Eva (Pearl) Peace: Sula's aunt; Eva Sr.'s youngest daughter and middle child. *Ralph (Plum) Peace: Sula's uncle; Eva's son and youngest child. Plum was a WWI veteran and a heroin addict. Eva burns him alive with kerosene because of his mental instability. *Helene Wright: Nel's straight-laced and clean mother. Though the daughter of a prostitute, she was raised by her devoutly religious grandmother, Cecile. *Nel Wright: Sula's best friend (can also be considered a main protagonist) who does not want to be like her mother because she will never be reduced to \\"custard\\" and she will not be humiliated by other people as her mother is. Nel is the opposite of Sula: she decided to marry, have children and stay in the Bottom when she became an adult. She is Sula's best friend as they are children and then their relation turned into something more complex when Jude left Nel for Sula. *Shadrack: A paranoid shell-shocked WWI veteran, who returns to Sula and Nel's hometown, Medallion. He invents National Suicide Day. *Jude Greene: Nel's husband, who leaves Nel due to a love affair with Sula. *Ajax (Albert Jacks): Sula's confidant and lover. *Tar Baby (Pretty Johnnie): A quiet, cowardly, and reserved partially or possibly fully white man who rents out one of the rooms in the Peace household. It is believed that Tar Baby has come up to the bottom to drink himself to death. *The Deweys: three boys, each about one year apart from one another in age, who were each nicknamed \\"Dewey\\" by Eva. Their real names are never written in the novel, and after the introduction of these characters, the three were referred as one being, thus Morrison's use of a lowercase \\"d\\" in \\"dewey\\" for the rest of the novel. *Chicken Little: The little boy whom Sula accidentally drowns by throwing into the river. ==Major themes== Motherhood Sula is packed with formal moves against social structures. On the surface, Nel and Sula may appear as polar opposites, dissimilar characters with divergent world views, though Morrison‚Äôs nuanced character portrayals and overall narrative construction resists any attempt at settling into static binary oppositions, including those that might hold varying expressions of motherhood. At the outset, Morrison establishes the complexity of the women we encounter. They are multi-dimensional beings with equally complex familial relationships. The first female characters introduced are four generations of women in Nel‚Äôs family. Nel‚Äôs mother Helene, we learn, is born to a \\"Creole whore\\", (17) and is subsequently raised by her grandmother, under the perceived protection of religion. These precautions are taken in an effort to save Helene from her mother‚Äôs \\"wild blood\\". (17) As the chapter progresses and Helene and Nel return to New Orleans (a site rich with cultural meaning) where we meet Rochelle, Helene‚Äôs birth mother, Morrison begins to challenge conventional notions of motherhood while also reinforcing the significance of the extended black family structure. When Rochelle and Helene meet there is no familiar connection between the two ‚Äî no bond to speak of. It is Helene‚Äôs grandmother, Cecile, who stands in as a mother figure and her primary caretaker. Eva, Sula‚Äôs grandmother, operates a boarding house and is about the business of her own version of mothering, \\"directing the lives of her children, friends, strays, and constant stream of boarders\\" (30). Expressions of motherhood appear to exist on a spectrum in Sula, erring however, on the side of the unconventional. In Sula, relationships between mothers and daughters do not seem to be predicated on shared affection and a duty to protect one‚Äôs offspring. For example, Hannah, Sula‚Äôs mother is overheard in conversation with her friends, \\"You love her, like I love Sula. I just don‚Äôt like her. That‚Äôs the difference.\\" (57) Hannah‚Äôs comment does gesture toward a sense of duty, but differs from Jacobs‚Äô as it implies an absence of a desire to mother. When Hannah challenges her mother Eva about expressions of love toward her, Eva responds by reminding Hannah of the sacrifices that she has made for her. Love and mothering to Eva is about sacrifice and self-preservation, \\"‚Ä¶what you talkin' 'bout did I love you girl I stayed alive for you can‚Äôt you get that through your thick head or what is that between your ears, heifer?\\" (69) Doubleness Sula demonstrates numerous doubles or parallels between the novel‚Äôs characters. For example, Sula and Eva both kill men (Sula kills Chicken Little; Eva kills Plum). The death of Chicken Little results in a closed casket funeral (64). Likewise, for Hannah, \\"the casket had to be kept closed at the funeral\\" (77). Chicken died by water, Hannah died by fire. Nel watches Chicken die by drowning, according to Eva at the later scene in the nursing home (168). Sula watches Hannah die in flames (78). Both Plum and Hannah ‚Äîbrother and sister‚Äî die by fire (Plum is burned to death by Eva, Hannah dies from her injuries after catching fire by accident). Symbolism Though Morrison's use of symbolism is continuous through the novel, the most important symbol is the birthmark Sula has over her eye. The darkening of it over the years represents her maturity and gradual defiance of social conventionality. The appearance of the birthmark is utilized to reveal how each character perceived Sula. Nel thought it looked like a rose, symbolizing love, friendship, and female beauty; Jude thought it was a snake, symbolizing deception and seduction, which the rest of the town agreed with; Perhaps even more significant than Nel's perception of the mark is Shadrack's, who thought it looked like a tadpole. He was the only person that thought of her as harmless. ==Literary significance and criticism== Sula was integral to the formation of black feminist literary criticism. In 1977, black feminist literary critic Barbara Smith, in her essay \\"Toward a Black Feminist Criticism,\\" advanced a definition of black feminist literary criticism and (in)famously performed a lesbian reading of Sula.Smith, Barbara, Toward a Black Feminist Criticism. No. 5. Crossing Press, 1977. In her 1980 essay \\"New Directions for Black Feminist Criticism,\\" Black feminist literary critic Deborah McDowell responded to Smith's challenge by acknowledging the need for a black feminist criticism and calling for a firmer definition of black feminism.McDowell, Deborah E. \\"New directions for Black feminist criticism.\\" Black American Literature Forum. School of Education, Indiana State University, 1980. In her essay \\"Boundaries: Or Distant Relations and Close Kin\\", Deborah McDowell draws on the critical practices of Hortense Spillers and Hazel Carby and reads Sula from a poststructuralist perspective, urging black women critics to \\"develop and practice [‚Ä¶] critical approaches interactively, dialogically\\" instead of viewing \\"black female identity as unitary essence yielding an indigenous critical methodology.\\"McDowell, Deborah E. \\"Boundaries: Or Distant Relations and Close Kin\\", in Houston A. Baker and Patricia Redmond (eds), Afro-American Literary Study in the 1990s, Chicago, London: University of Chicago Press, 1989. As she points out, the ambiguity of Sula as a character subverts traditional binary oppositions, and \\"transcends the boundaries of social and linguistic convention.\\" The decentering and temporal deferral of the character who lends the novel its title similarly \\"denies the whole notion of character as static essence, replacing it with the idea of character as process.\\" This \\"complex set of dynamics\\" forces the reader to \\"fill in the gaps\\" as well as to \\"bridge the gaps separating [them] from the text\\" and therefore makes them active participants in the meaning- making process. The beauty of Morrison‚Äôs narrative is its complexity and its ability to illustrate the fluidity and valences of the black female subject as captured in the quotidian. McDowell underscores this point, arguing against regarding black women's lives as homogenous, \\"they have not developed in a vacuum, but, rather in a complex social framework that includes interaction with black men, white men, and white women, among diverse social groups and subgroups.McDowell, \\"Boundaries\\", 54.\\" In his book Aberrations in Black, scholar Roderick Ferguson uses Sula as an example of Queer of Color Critique in action in that it depicts how Black women orient themselves toward an alternative social relationship. Ferguson argues that Sula is constructed as other within the imperatives of heteropatriarchal privilege, and represents a desire \\"to formulate identities and social practices that could withstand and provide alternatives\\" to current societal limitations. Ferguson cites Sula as an example of coalition building among women of color. ==References== ==External links== * Sula study guide, themes, quotes, teacher resources Category:1973 American novels Category:Novels by Toni Morrison Category:Novels set in Ohio Category:Alfred A.

The book's epigraph is Romans 9:25. ==Plot summary== Beloved begins in 1873 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where the protagonist Sethe, a formerly enslaved woman, has been living with her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver at 124 Bluestone Road. The book explores the lives of Sethe and her daughter after their escape from slavery, opening in 1873 after the Civil War. Their Cincinnati home has been haunted for years by an abusive revenant, whom they believe to be the ghost of Sethe's eldest daughter. Because of the haunting‚Äîwhich often involves objects being thrown around the room‚ÄîSethe's youngest daughter Denver is shy, friendless, and housebound. Sethe's sons, Howard and Buglar, ran away from home by the age of 13. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent ghost. Baby Suggs, the mother of Sethe's husband Halle, lived with the family but died in her bed soon after the boys fled, eight years before the start of the novel. Paul D, one of the enslaved men from Sweet Home, the plantation where Sethe, Halle, Baby Suggs, and several others were once enslaved, arrives at Sethe's home. He tries to dismiss what he thinks are superstitions. He tries to help the family forget the bitter past and forces out the spirit. He seems successful at first: he persuades Denver to leave the house for the first time in years. But when they return home, Sethe, Denver, and Paul D encounter a young woman sitting in front of the house, calling herself Beloved. Paul D is suspicious and warns Sethe, but she is charmed by the young woman and ignores him. Paul D begins to feel increasingly uncomfortable in Sethe's bedroom and begins sleeping in different places on the property, attempting to find a place that feels right. One night, while sleeping in the woodshed, Paul D is cornered by Beloved. While they have sex, his mind is filled with horrific memories from his past. Overwhelmed with guilt, Paul D tries to tell Sethe about it but cannot. Instead, he says that he wants her pregnant. Sethe is apprehensive but eager for the prospect of their relationship. Paul D resists Beloved and her influence over him. But when he tells friends at work about his plans to start a new family, they react fearfully. One, Stamp Paid, reveals the reason for the community's rejection of Sethe. When Paul D asks Sethe about it, she tells him what happened. After escaping from Sweet Home and joining her children at her mother-in-law's home, four horsemen came to the house at 124 Bluestone Road. Schoolteacher, one of his nephews, a slave catcher, and the sheriff wanted to return her and her children to a life of slavery at the Sweet Home plantation in Kentucky. Sethe grabbed her children, ran to the woodshed, and tried to kill them all. She succeeded only in killing her eldest daughter, then two years old and \\"crawlin already.\\" Sethe said that she was \\"trying to put [her] babies where they would be safe.\\" Paul D leaves after this revelation. Sethe comes to believe that Beloved is the daughter she had killed, as \\"BELOVED\\" was all she could afford to have engraved on her daughter's tombstone. Sethe begins to spend all of her time and money on Beloved, carelessly spoiling Beloved out of guilt, to the point that Sethe loses her job. Beloved becomes angry and more demanding, throwing tantrums when she does not get her way. Beloved's presence consumes Sethe's life to the point where she becomes depleted. She hardly eats, while Beloved grows bigger and bigger, eventually taking the form of a pregnant woman. In the novel's climax, Denver reaches out to the Black community for help. Some of the local women come to the house to exorcise Beloved. At the same time, a white man, Mr. Bodwin, arrives at the house on a horse. When Baby Suggs arrived in Ohio after Halle bought her freedom from their owner, Mr. Bodwin had offered her the Cincinnati house as a place to stay in exchange for laundry and mending tasks. He has come for Denver, who asked him for a job. Denver had not told her mother, and not understanding why he was here, Sethe attacks the white man with an ice pick, thinking it was Schoolteacher trying to take her daughter. While Sethe is confused and has a \\"re-memory\\" of her master coming again, the village women take her over and Beloved disappears. Denver becomes a working member of the community, and Paul D returns to a bed-ridden Sethe, who, depleted of life at Beloved's disappearance, remorsefully tells him that Beloved was her \\"best thing.\\" He replies that Sethe is her own \\"best thing\\", leaving her questioning \\"Me? Me?\\" ==Major themes== ===Mother-daughter relationships=== The maternal bonds between Sethe and her children inhibit her own individuation and prevent the development of her self. Sethe develops a dangerous maternal passion that results in killing one daughter, her own \\"best self.\\" Her surviving daughter becomes estranged from the black community. Both outcomes result from Sethe trying to salvage her \\"fantasy of the future\\", her children, from a life in slavery. In Ohio, Sethe fails to recognize her daughter Denver's need for interaction with the black community in order to enter into womanhood. At the end of the novel, Denver succeeds in establishing her own self and embarking on her individuation with the help of Beloved. Sethe only becomes individuated after Beloved's exorcism. Then she is free to fully accept the first relationship that is completely \\"for her\\", her relationship with Paul D. This relationship relieves her from the self- destruction she was causing based on her maternal bonds with her children. Beloved and Sethe are both emotionally impaired, which became of Sethe having been enslaved. Under slavery, mothers lost their children, with devastating consequences for both parties. Sethe was traumatized by having had her milk stolen, rather than being able to nurse her own child. It made her unable to form the symbolic bond between herself and her daughter. ===Psychological effects of slavery=== Because of the suffering under slavery, most persons who had been enslaved tried to repress these memories in an attempt to forget the past. This repression and dissociation from the past causes a fragmentation of the self and a loss of true identity. Sethe, Paul D., and Denver all suffered a loss of self, which could only be remedied when they were able to reconcile their pasts and memories of earlier identities. Beloved serves to remind these characters of their repressed memories, eventually leading to the reintegration of their selves. Slavery splits a person into a fragmented figure.Fulton, Lara Mary (1997). \\"An unblinking gaze: Readerly response- ability and racial reconstructions in Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye and Beloved\\" (M.A. thesis). Waterloo, Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University The identity, consisting of painful memories and unspeakable past, denied and kept at bay, becomes a \\"self that is no self.\\" To heal and humanize, one must constitute it in a language, reorganize the painful events and retell the painful memories. As a result of suffering, the \\"self\\" becomes subject to a violent practice of making and unmaking, once acknowledged by an audience becomes real. Sethe, Paul D, and Baby Suggs, who all fall short of such realization, are unable to remake their selves by trying to keep their pasts at bay. The 'self' is located in a word, defined by others. The power lies in the audience, or more precisely, in the word‚Äîonce the word changes, so does the identity. All of the characters in Beloved face the challenge of an unmade self, composed of their \\"rememories\\" and defined by perceptions and language. The barrier that keeps them from remaking of the self is the desire for an \\"uncomplicated past\\" and the fear that remembering will lead them to \\"a place they couldn't get back from.\\" === Definition of manhood === The discussion of manhood and masculinity is foreshadowed by the dominant meaning of Sethe's story. Beloved depicts slavery in two main emotions: Love and Self- Preservation; however, Morrison does more than depict emotions. The author dramatizes enslavement to speak of the morals of manhood. It also distorts a man from himself. Morrison revealed different pathways to the meaning of manhood by her stylistic devices. She established new information for understanding the legacy of slavery best depicted through stylistic devices. To understand Paul D's perception of manhood, Morrison deliberately inserts his half-formed words and thoughts, to provide the audience a ‚Äútaste‚Äù of what is going on inside his mind. Yet, throughout the novel, Paul D's depiction of manhood was being constantly challenged by the norms and values of white culture. The author demonstrates the distinctions between ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù and ‚ÄúAfrican‚Äù values and how the dialogue between the two values is heard through juxtaposition and allusions. She maneuvered her ‚Äúmessage‚Äù though the social atmosphere of her words - which was further highlighted by the character's motives and actions. Paul D is a victim of racism in that his dreams and goals are so high that he will never be able to achieve them because of racism. He thought he earned his right to reach each of his goals because of his sacrifices and what he has been through: that society would pay him back and allow him to do what his heart desired. During the Reconstruction Era, Jim Crow laws were put in place to limit the movement and involvement of African- Americans in the white-dominant society. Black men during this time had to establish their own identity, which may seem impossible due to all the limitations put upon them. Many black men, like Paul D, struggled to find their meaning in their society and achieving their goals because of the ‚Äúdisabilities‚Äù that constrained them to a certain part of the social hierarchy. In Beloved, Stamp Paid observes Paul D sitting on the base of the church steps ‚Äú‚Ä¶ liquor bottle in hand, stripped of the very maleness that enables him to caress and love the wounded Sethe‚Ä¶‚Äù (132). Throughout the novel, Paul D is sitting on a base of some sort or a foundation like a tree stub or the steps, for instance. This exemplifies his place in society. Black men are the foundation of society because without their hard labor, the white men would not profit. They were coerced into the society where they were deemed \\"lower-status\\" because of the color of their skin. This print visualizes the Emancipation Proclamation. === Family relationships === Family relationships are an instrumental element of Beloved. These family relationships help visualize the stress and the dismantlement of African- American families in this era. The slavery system did not allow African- Americans to have rights to themselves, to their family, belongings, and even their children. So, Sethe killing Beloved was deemed a peaceful act because Sethe believed that killing her daughter was saving them. And by doing this, their family is divided and fragmented, much like the time they were living in. After the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, formerly enslaved families were broken and bruised because of the hardships they faced while they were enslaved. Since enslaved people could not participate in societal events, they put their faith and trust in the supernatural. They did rituals and prayed to their god or multiple gods. In the novel, Sethe's child, Beloved, who was murdered by the hands of her mother, haunts her. For example, Sethe, Denver, and Paul D go to the neighborhood carnival, which happens to be Sethe's first social outing since killing her daughter. When they return home, that is when Beloved appears at the house. Throughout the novel, Sethe believes that the person claiming to be ‚ÄúBeloved‚Äù is her daughter that she killed 18 years prior - a scenario which shows how [fractured] family relationships are used to display the mental strife the protagonist faces. === Pain === The pain throughout this novel is universal because everyone involved in slavery was heavily scarred, whether that be physically, mentally, sociologically, or psychologically. Some of the characters tend to ‚Äúromanticize‚Äù their pain, in a way that each experience is a turning point in one's life. This concept is played throughout history in early Christian contemplative tradition and African American blues tradition. Beloved is a book of the systematic torture that people who had been enslaved had to deal with after the Emancipation Proclamation. Therefore, in this novel, the narrative is like a complex labyrinth because all the characters have been ‚Äústripped away‚Äù from their voice, their narrative, their language in a way that their sense of self is diminished. Also, all the characters have had different experiences with slavery, which is why their stories and their narrative are distinct from each other. In addition to the pain, many major characters try to beautify pain in a way that diminishes what was done. For example, Sethe keeps repeating what a white girl said about her scars on her back, calling them ‚Äúa Choke-cherry tree. Trunk, branches, and even leaves‚Äù (16). She repeats this to everyone, suggesting she is trying to find the beauty in her scar, even when they caused her extreme pain. Paul D and Baby Suggs both look away in disgust and deny that description of Sethe's scars. Also, Sethe does the same thing with Beloved. The memory of her ghost-like daughter plays a role of memory, grief and spite that separates Sethe and her late daughter. For instance, Beloved stays in the house with Paul D and Sethe. A home is a place of vulnerability, where the heart lies. Paul D and Baby Suggs both suggest that Beloved is not invited into the home, but Sethe says otherwise because she sees Beloved, all grown and alive, instead of the pain of when Sethe murdered her. == Major characters == === Sethe === Sethe is the protagonist of the novel. She escaped slavery from a plantation called Sweet Home. She lives in the house named 124 (a house on 124 Bluestone Rd. but referred to only as \\"124\\") which is believed to be haunted because she killed her infant child. Her two sons have fled because of the haunting and she resides in the house with her daughter Denver. She is motherly and will do anything to protect her children from suffering the same abuses she had when she was enslaved. Sethe is greatly influenced by her repression of the trauma she endured, she lives with \\"a tree on her back\\", scars from being whipped. Her character is resilient, yet defined by her traumatic past. === Beloved === The opaque understanding of Beloved is central to the novel. She is a young woman who mysteriously appears from a body of water near Sethe's house and is discovered soaking wet on the doorstep by Sethe, Paul D, and Denver, on their return from visiting the fair; they take her in. It is widely believed that she is the murdered baby who haunted 124, as the haunting ends when she arrives, and in many ways she behaves like a child. Morrison, herself, stated that the character Beloved is the daughter Sethe killed. https://www.arts.gov/art-works/2015/toni-morrison-how-beloved- came-be The murdered baby was unnamed, her name is derived from the engraving on Sethe's murdered baby's tombstone, which simply read \\"Beloved\\" because Sethe could not afford to engrave the word \\"Dearly\\" or anything else. Beloved becomes a catalyst to bring repressed trauma of the family to the surface, but also creates madness in the house and slowly depletes Sethe. === Paul D === Paul D retains his slave name - all the enslaved men at Sweet Home were named Paul. He also retains many painful memories from enslavement and being forced to live in a chain gang. It is said that his heart is kept in a \\"tobacco tin\\", as he continuously represses his painful memories. Years after their time together at Sweet Home, Paul D and Sethe reunite and begin a romantic relationship. === Denver === Denver is Sethe's only child who remains at House 124. Isolated from her community after Beloved's killing, Denver forms a close bond with her mother. Upon Beloved's arrival, Denver watches as her sister's ghost begins to exhibit demonic activity. Although introduced as a childish character, Denver develops into a protective woman throughout the novel. In the final chapters, Denver fights not only for her personal independence, but also for her mother's wellbeing, breaking the cycle of isolation at House 124. === Baby Suggs === Baby Suggs is the elderly mother of Halle. Halle works to buy her freedom, after which she travels to Cincinnati and establishes herself as a respected leader in the community. She lived in 124 where the majority of the novel takes place in the present time. After Sethe's act of infanticide Baby Suggs retires to her death bed where she develops an obsession with colors. Sethe inherits the house after her death. === Halle === Halle is the son of Baby Suggs, the husband of Sethe and father of her children. He and Sethe were married in Sweet Home, yet they got separated during her escape. He is not in the present of the novel, but is mentioned in flashbacks. Paul D was the last to see Halle, churning butter at Sweet Home. It is presumed he went mad after seeing residents of Sweet Home violating Sethe. === Schoolteacher === Schoolteacher is the primary discipliner, violent, abusive, and cruel to the people he enslaved at Sweet Home. He eventually comes after Sethe following her escape but is unsuccessful in his attempt to recapture her and her children. === Amy Denver === Amy Denver is a compassionate young white girl who finds Sethe desperately trying to make her way to safety after her escape from Sweet Home. Sethe is extremely pregnant at the time, and her feet are bleeding badly from the travel. Amy saves Sethe's life nurturing her back to health. Later, Amy delivers Sethe's daughter on a small boat, and Sethe names the child Denver after her. ==Adaptations== In 1998, the novel was made into a film directed by Jonathan Demme and produced by and starring Oprah Winfrey. In January 2016, Beloved was broadcast in 10 episodes by BBC Radio 4 as part of its 15 Minute Drama programme. The radio series was adapted by Patricia Cumper. ==Legacy== Beloved received the Frederic G. Melcher Book Award, which is named for an editor of Publishers Weekly. In accepting the award on October 12, 1988, Morrison said, \\"that 'there is no suitable memorial or plaque or wreath or wall or park or skyscraper lobby'\\" honoring the memory of the human beings forced into slavery and brought to the United States. 'There's no small bench by the road,' she continued. 'And because such a place doesn't exist (that I know of), the book had to.' Inspired by her remarks, the Toni Morrison Society began to install benches at significant sites in the history of slavery in America. The New York Times reported that the first 'bench by the road' was dedicated on July 26, 2008, on Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, the place of entry for some 40 percent of the enslaved Africans brought to the United States. Morrison said she was extremely moved by the memorial.\\"A bench by the road\\", UU World, August 11, 2008.Lee, Felicia R., \\"Bench of Memory at Slavery‚Äôs Gateway\\", The New York Times, July 28, 2008. In 2017 the 21st bench was placed at the Library of Congress. It is dedicated to Daniel Alexander Payne Murray (1852‚Äì1925), the first African-American assistant librarian of Congress. The novel received the seventh annual Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights Book Award in 1988, given to a novelist who \\"most faithfully and forcefully reflects Robert Kennedy's purposes‚Äîhis concern for the poor and the powerless, his struggle for honest and even-handed justice, his conviction that a decent society must assure all young people a fair chance, and his faith that a free democracy can act to remedy disparities of power and opportunity.\\" ===Critical reception=== The publication of Beloved in 1987 resulted in the greatest acclaim yet for Morrison. Although nominated for the National Book Award, it did not win, and 48 African-American writers and critics‚Äîincluding Maya Angelou, Amiri Baraka, Jayne Cortez, Angela Davis, Ernest J. Gaines, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Rosa Guy, June Jordan, Paule Marshall, Louise Meriwether, Eugene Redmond, Sonia Sanchez, Quincy Troupe, John Edgar Wideman, and John A. Williams‚Äîsigned a letter of protest that was published in The New York Times Book Review on January 24, 1988.McDowell, Edwin, \\"48 Black Writers Protest By Praising Morrison\\", The New York Times, January 19, 1988.Troy, \\"Writers Demand Recognition for Toni Morrison (1988)\\", AALBC.com, July 27, 2012. Yet later in 1988 Beloved did receive the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction,Eleanor Randolph, \\"Morrison Novel 'Beloved' Wins Pulitzer Prize\\", The Washington Post, April 1, 1988. as well as the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Book Award, the Melcher Book Award, the Lyndhurst Foundation Award, and the Elmer Holmes Bobst Award. Despite its popularity and status as one of Morrison's most accomplished novels, Beloved has never been universally hailed as a success. Some reviewers have excoriated the novel for what they consider its excessive sentimentality and sensationalistic depiction of the horrors of slavery, including its characterization of the slave trade as a Holocaust-like genocide. Others, while concurring that Beloved is at times overwritten, have lauded the novel as a profound and extraordinary act of imagination. Noting the work's mythic dimensions and political focus, these commentators have treated the novel as an exploration of family, trauma, and the repression of memory as well as an attempt to restore the historical record and give voice to the collective memory of African Americans. Indeed, critics and Morrison herself have indicated that the controversial epigraph to Beloved, \\"sixty million and more\\", is drawn from a number of studies on the African slave trade which estimate that approximately half of each ship's \\"cargo\\" perished in transit to America. Scholars have additionally debated the nature of the character Beloved, arguing whether she is actually a ghost or a real person. Numerous reviews, assuming Beloved to be a supernatural incarnation of Sethe's daughter, have subsequently faulted Beloved as an unconvincing and confusing ghost story. Elizabeth B. House, however, has argued that Beloved is not a ghost, and the novel is actually a story of two probable instances of mistaken identity. Beloved is haunted by the loss of her African parents and thus comes to believe that Sethe is her mother. Sethe longs for her dead daughter and is rather easily convinced that Beloved is the child she has lost. Such an interpretation, House contends, clears up many puzzling aspects of the novel and emphasizes Morrison's concern with familial ties. Since the late 1970s, there has been a strong focus on Morrison's representation of African-American experience and history. The idea that writing acts as a means of healing or recovery is a strain in many of these studies. Timothy Powell, for instance, argues that Morrison's recovery of a black logos rewrites blackness as \\"affirmation, presence, and good\\", while Theodore O. Mason, Jr., suggests that Morrison's stories unite communities. Many critics explore memory, or what Beloved‚Äôs Sethe calls \\"rememory\\", in this light. Susan Bowers places Morrison in a \\"long tradition of African American apocalyptic writing\\" that looks back in time, \\"unveiling\\" the horrors of the past in order to \\"transform\\" them. Several critics have interpreted Morrison's representations of trauma and memory through a psychoanalytic framework. Ashraf H. A. Rushdy explores how \\"primal scenes\\" in Morrison's novels are \\"an opportunity and affective agency for self-discovery through memory\\" and \\"rememory\\". As Jill Matus argues, however, Morrison's representations of trauma are ‚Äúnever simply curative‚Äù: in raising the ghosts of the past in order to banish or memorialize them, the texts potentially ‚Äúprovoke readers to the vicarious experience of trauma and act as a means of transmission\\". Ann Snitow's reaction to Beloved neatly illustrates how Morrison criticism began to evolve and move toward new modes of interpretation. In her 1987 review of Beloved, Snitow argues that Beloved, the ghost at the center of the narrative, is \\"too light\\" and \\"hollow\\", rendering the entire novel \\"airless\\". Snitow changed her position after reading criticism that interpreted Beloved in a different way, seeing something more complicated and burdened than a literal ghost, something requiring different forms of creative expression and critical interpretation. The conflicts at work here are ideological as well as critical: they concern the definition and evaluation of American and African-American literature, the relationship between art and politics, and the tension between recognition and appropriation. In defining Morrison's texts as African-American literature, critics have become more attentive to historical and social context and to the way Morrison's fiction engages with specific places and moments in time. As Jennings observes, many of Morrison's novels are set in isolated black communities where African practices and belief systems are not marginalized by a dominant white culture but rather remain active, if perhaps subconscious, forces shaping the community. Matus comments that Morrison's later novels \\"have been even more thoroughly focused on specific historical moments\\"; \\"through their engagement with the history of slavery and early twentieth- century Harlem, [they] have imagined and memorialized aspects of black history that have been forgotten or inadequately remembered\\". On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed Beloved on its list of the 100 most influential novels. ===Banning and controversy=== Beloved has been banned from five U.S. schools since 2007. Common reasons for censorship include bestiality, infanticide, sex, and violence. Twenty years after Beloved's publication, in 1987, the novel was first banned from AP English classes at Eastern High School in Louisville, Kentucky because of the book's mention of bestiality, racism and sex. The cause of the book being banned was because two parents complained that the book discussed inappropriate parts about the Antebellum slavery.Beloved, Banned, \\"The History of the Banned Book\\", October 23, 2019, In 2017, Beloved was considered for removal from the Fairfax County (VA) senior English reading list due to a parent's complaint that ‚Äúthe book includes scenes of violent sex, including a gang rape, and was too graphic and extreme for teenagers‚Äù.Titus, Ron, \\"Banned Books By Year\\", July 20, 2017, Parental concern about Beloveds content inspired the ‚ÄúBeloved Bill‚Äù, legislation that, if passed, would require Virginia public schools to notify parents of any ‚Äúsexually explicit content‚Äù and provide an alternative assignment if requested.American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression, \\"Coalition to Virginia Governor: Veto the 'Beloved' Bill\\", March 9, 2016, ==Awards== * Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, 1988\\"Beloved, by Toni Morrison (Alfred A.

After her marriage to the artist Stephen Weinstein, they changed their surname to Winsten (with her becoming Clare Winsten) and both became Quaker humanists. ==Biography== Birnberg, whose father was born in Ternopil in modern Ukraine, moved to England with her family in 1902. Studying at the Slade School of Fine Art between 1910 and 1912 with Isaac Rosenberg and David Bomberg, Birnberg became the only female member of their 'Whitechapel Boys' circle of artists and poets, and was the only female exhibitor at the 1914 post-Impressionist exhibition \\"Twentieth Century Art: A Review of Modern Movements\\" at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in which this circle played a major part. Among her sculptures are one in the Toynbee Hall in Whitechapel, and one of Joan of Arc in the garden of George Bernard Shaw‚Äôs house in Ayot St Lawrence in Hertfordshire, where Shaw and the Winstens were neighbours (Stephen already had connections with Shaw). Clare illustrated Shaw's Buoyant Billions: A Comedy of No Manners in Prose (1949), and the posthumously published My Dear Dorothea: A practical system of Moral education for females Embodied in a letter to a young person Of that sex (1956), written when he was 21. In addition to painting Shaw a number of times, Birnberg also produced a 1946 bronze sculpture of him, which passed on his death to the Shaw Theatre and then (on its closure) to the Mayor of Camden. She also made drawings of Shaw, as well as of Dmitri Shostakovich, Benjamin Britten and Mahatma Gandhi. Their daughter Ruth Harrison was known as a campaigner for animal rights.

Some live in the tropical forests of the foothills, but most live in rugged grassland and pine forest zones higher up. The Igorot numbered about 1.5 million in the early 21st century. Their languages belong to the northern Luzon subgroup of the Philippine languages, which belong to the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) family. ==Etymology== From the root word golot, which means \\"mountain\\", Igolot means \\"people from the mountains\\" (Tagalog: ‚ÄúMountaineer‚Äù), a reference to any of various ethnic groups in the mountains of northern Luzon. Their languages belong to the northern Luzon subgroup of the Philippine languages, which belong to the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) family. The endonyms Ifugao or Ipugaw (also meaning \\"mountain people\\") are used more frequently by the Igorots themselves, as igorot is viewed by some as slightly pejorative, except by the Ibaloys. ==Cordillera ethnic groups== The Banaue Rice Terraces The Igorots may be roughly divided into two general subgroups: the larger group lives in the south, central and western areas, and is very adept at rice- terrace farming; the smaller group lives in the east and north. Prior to Spanish colonisation of the islands, the peoples now included under the term did not consider themselves as belonging to a single, cohesive ethnic group. They may be further subdivided into five ethnolinguistic groups: the Bontoc, Ibaloi, Isnag (or Isneg/Apayao), Kalinga, and the Kankanaey. ===Bontoc=== A Bontoc woman with a snake skeleton in her hair. Skeletons serve as a charm against lightning. A Bontoc man (c. 1903) The Bontoc live on the banks of the Chico River in the Central Mountain Province on the island of Luzon. They speak Bontoc and Ilocano. They formerly practiced head-hunting and had distinctive body tattoos. The Bontoc describe three types of tattoos: The chak-lag‚Ä≤, the tattooed chest of the head taker; pong‚Ä≤-o, the tattooed arms of men and women; and fa‚Ä≤-tƒïk, for all other tattoos of both sexes. Women were tattooed on the arms only. In the past, the Bontoc engaged in none of the usual pastimes or games of chance practiced in other areas of the country, but did perform a circular rhythmic dance acting out certain aspects of the hunt, always accompanied by the gang‚Ä≤-sa or bronze gong. There was no singing or talking during the dance drama, but the women took part, usually outside the circumference. It was a serious but pleasurable event for all concerned, including the children. Present-day Bontocs are a peaceful agricultural people who have, by choice, retained most of their traditional culture despite frequent contacts with other groups. A traditional Bontoc ritual during a wake with a death chair. The pre-Christian Bontoc belief system centers on a hierarchy of spirits, the highest being a supreme deity called Intutungcho, whose son, Lumawig, descended from the sky (chayya), to marry a Bontoc girl. Lumawig taught the Bontoc their arts and skills, including irrigation of their land. The Bontoc also believe in the anito, spirits of the dead, who are omnipresent and must be constantly consoled. Anyone can invoke the anito, but a seer (insup-ok) intercedes when someone is sick through evil spirits. Bontoc house, 1903.Bale house of Igorot people with its skeletal displays. The Bontoc social structure used to be centered around village wards (ato) containing about 14 to 50 homes. Traditionally, young men and women lived in dormitories and ate meals with their families. This gradually changed with the advent of Christianity. In general, however, it can be said that all Bontocs are very aware of their own way of life and are not overly eager to change. ===Ibaloi=== The Ibaloi (also Ibaloi, Ibaluy, Nabaloi, Inavidoy, Inibaloi, Ivadoy) and Kalanguya (also Kallahan and Ikalahan) are one of the indigenous peoples of the Philippines who live mostly in the southern part of Benguet, located in the Cordillera of northern Luzon, and Nueva Vizcaya in the Cagayan Valley region. They were traditionally an agrarian society. Many of the Ibaloi and Kalanguya people continue with their agriculture and rice cultivation. Their native language belongs to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian languages family and is closely related to the Pangasinan language, primarily spoken in the province of Pangasinan, located southwest of Benguet. Baguio, the major city of the Cordillera, dubbed the \\"Summer Capital of the Philippines,\\" is located in southern Benguet. The largest feast of the Ibaloi is the Peshit or Pedit, a public feast mainly sponsored by people of prestige and wealth. Peshit can last for weeks and involves the killing and sacrifice of dozens of animals. One of the more popular dances of the Ibaloi is the bendian, a mass dance participated in by hundreds of male and female dancers. Originally a victory dance in time of war, it evolved into a celebratory dance. It is used as entertainment (ad-adivay) in the ca√±ao feasts, hosted by the wealthy class (baknang). ===Ifugao=== An Ifugao man from Banaue Ifugaos are the people inhabiting Ifugao Province. They come from the municipalities of Lagawe (Capital Town), Aguinaldo, Alfonso Lista, Asipulo, Banaue, Hingyon, Hungduan, Kiangan, Lamut, Mayoyao and Tinoc. The term \\"Ifugao\\" is derived from \\"ipugo\\" which means \\"earth people\\", \\"mortals\\" or \\"humans\\", as distinguished from spirits and deities. It also means \\"from the hill\\", as pugo means hill. The province of Ifugao in the southeastern part of the Cordillera region is best known for its famous Banaue Rice Terraces, which in modern times have become one of the major tourist attractions of the Philippines and one of the eight wonders of the world. Traditionally, Ifugaos build their typical houses (bale), consisting of one room, built on 4 wooden posts 3 meters off the ground. There is a detachable ladder (tete) for the front door (panto). Huts are temporary buildings. Rice granaries are called alang, protected by a wooden idol (bulul). Aside from their rice terraces, the Ifugaos, who speak four distinct dialects, are known for their rich oral literary traditions of hudhud and the alim. Due to being isolated by the terrain, Ifugaos usually speak in English and Ilocano as their alternative to their mother tongue. Most Ifugaos are fluent in Filipino/Tagalog. The Ifugaos‚Äô highest prestige feasts are the hagabi, sponsored by the elite (kadangyan); and the uyauy, a marriage feast sponsored by those immediately below the wealthiest (inmuy-ya-uy). The middle class are the tagu, while the poor are the nawotwot. Alim and Hudhud Oral traditions of Ifugao of Ifugao people of the Cordillera Administrative Region in Luzon island of Philippines. In 2001, the Hudhud Chants of the Ifugao was chosen as one of the 11 Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. It was then formally inscribed as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008. ===Isneg=== An Isneg woman. The Isnag, also Isneg or Apayao, live at the northwesterly end of northern Luzon, in the upper half of the Cordillera province of Apayao. The term \\"Isneg\\" derives from itneg, meaning inhabitants of the Tineg River. Apayao derives from the battle cry Ma-ap-ay-ao as their hand is clapped rapidly over their mouth. They may also refer to themselves as Imandaya if they live upstream, or Imallod if they live downstream. The municipalities in the Isneg domain include Pudtol, Kabugao, Calanasan, Flora, Conner, Sta. Marcela, and Luna. Two major river systems, the Abulog River and the Apayao River, run through Isnag country. Jars of basi are half buried in the ground within a small shed, abulor, constructed of 4 posts and a shed. This abulor is found within the open space, linong or sidong, below their houses (balay). They grow upland rice, while also practicing swidden farming, and fishing. Say-am was an important ceremony after a successful headhunting, or other important occasions, hosted by the wealthy, and lasting one to five days or more. Dancing, singing, eating and drinking mark the feast, and Isnegs wear their finest clothes. The shaman, Anituwan, prays to the spirit Gatan, before the first dog is sacrificed, if a human head had not been taken, and offered at the sacred tree, ammadingan. On the last day, a coconut is split in honor of the headhunter guardian, Anglabbang.The Pildap is an equivalent say-am but hosted by the poor. Conversion to Christianity grew after 1920, and today, the Isnegs are divided in their religious beliefs, with some still being animistic. === Kalinga === Children from Lubuagan, Kalinga perform the muscle dance. The Kalinga, also known as \\"iKalingas\\", inhabit the drainage basin of the middle Chico River in Kalinga Province. The Kalinga are sub-divided into Southern and Northern groups; the latter is considered the most heavily ornamented people of the northern Philippines. The Kalinga practice both wet and dry rice farming. They also developed an institution of peace pacts called Bodong which has minimised traditional warfare and headhunting and serves as a mechanism for the initiation, maintenance, renewal and reinforcement of kinship and social ties. They also speak different kalinga tribal languages, Ilocano, Tagalog and English Kalinga, Ilocano languages. Kalinga society is very kinship-oriented, and relatives are held responsible for avenging any injury done to a member. Disputes are usually settled by the regional leaders, who listen to all sides and then impose fines on the guilty party. These are not formal council meetings, but carry a good deal of authority. ===Kankanaey=== A Kankanaey chief from the town of Suyoc, in Mankayan, Benguet (taken ). The Kankanaey domain includes Western Mountain Province, northern Benguet and southeastern Ilocos Sur. Like most Igorot ethnic groups, the Kankanaey built sloping terraces to maximize farm space in the rugged terrain of the Cordilleras. Kankanaey houses include the two-story innagamang, the larger binangi, the cheaper tinokbob, and the elevated tinabla. Their granaries (agamang) are elevated to avoid rats. Two other institutions of the Kankanaey of Mountain Province are the dap-ay, or the men's dormitory and civic center, and the ebgan, or the girls' dormitory. Kankanaey's major dances include tayaw, pat-tong, takik (a wedding dance), and balangbang. The tayaw is a community dance that is usually done in weddings it maybe also danced by the Ibaloi but has a different style. Pattong, also a community dance from Mountain Province which every municipality has its own style, while Balangbang is the dance's modern term. There are also some other dances like the sakkuting, pinanyuan (another wedding dance) and bogi-bogi (courtship dance). ====\\"Hard\\" and \\"Soft\\" Kankanaey==== The name Kankanaey came from the language which they speak. The only difference amongst the Kankanaey are the way they speak such as intonation and word usage. In intonation, there is distinction between those who speak Hard Kankanaey (Applai) and Soft Kankanaey. Speakers of Hard Kankanaey are from the towns of Sagada and Besao in the western Mountain Province as well as their environs. They speak Kankanaey with a hard intonation where they differ in some words from the soft-speaking Kankanaey. Soft-speaking Kankanaey come from Northern and other parts of Benguet, and from the municipalities of Sabangan, Tadian and Bauko in Mountain Province. In words for example an Applai might say otik or beteg (pig) and the soft- speaking Kankanaey use busaang or beteg as well. The Kankanaey may also differ in some words like egay or aga, maid or maga. They also differ in their ways of life and sometimes in culture. The Kankanaey are also internally identified by the language they speak and the province from whence they came. Kankanaey people from Mountain Province may call the Kankanaey from Benguet as iBenget while the Kankanaey of Benguet may call their fellow Kankanaey from Mountain Province iBontok. The Hard and Soft Kankanaey also differ in the way they dress. Women's dress of the Soft dialect generally has a colour combination of black, white and red. The design of the upper attire is a criss-crossed style of black, white and red colors. The skirt or tapis is a combination of stripes of black, white and red. Hard dialect women dress in mainly red and black with less white, with the skirt or tapis which is mostly called bakget and gateng. The men formerly wore a g-string known as a wanes for the Kanakaney's of Besao and Sagada. The design of the wanes may vary according to social status or municipality. ==Ethnic groups by linguistic classification== Political map of the Cordillera Administrative Region.

The gold found in the land of the Igorot was an attraction for the Spanish. Originally gold was exchanged at Pangasinan by the Igorot. The gold was used to buy consumable products by the Igorot. Both gold and desire to Christianize the Igorot were given as reasons for Spanish conquest. In 1572 the Spanish started hunting for the gold. Benguet Province was entered by the Spanish with the intention of obtaining gold. The fact that the Igorots managed to stay out of Spanish dominion vexed the Spaniards. The gold evaded the hands of the Spaniards due to Igorot opposition. Samuel E. Kane wrote about his life amongst the Bontoc, Ifugao, and Kalinga after the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, in his book Thirty Years with the Philippine Head- Hunters (1933).Kane, S.E., 1933, Life and Death in Luzon or Thirty Years with the Philippine Head-Hunters, New York: Grosset & Dunlap The first American school for Igorot girls was opened in Baguio in 1901 by Alice McKay Kelly. Kane noted that Dean C. Worcester \\"did more than any one man to stop head- hunting and to bring the traditional enemy tribes together in friendship.\\" Kane wrote of the Igorot people, \\"there is a peace, a rhythm and an elemental strength in the life...which all the comforts and refinements of civilization can not replace...fifty years hence...there will be little left to remind the young Igorots of the days when the drums and ganzas of the head-hunting canyaos resounded throughout the land. In 1904, a group of Igorot people were brought to St. Louis, Missouri, United States for the St. Louis World's Fair. They constructed the Igorot Village in the Philippine Exposition section of the fair, which became one of the most popular exhibits. The poet T. S. Eliot, who was born and raised in St. Louis, visited and explored the Village.

The play premiered on March 16, 1997, Off-Broadway at the Vineyard Theatre. Vogel received the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the work. It was written and developed at the Perseverance Theatre in Juneau, Alaska, with Molly Smith as artistic director. The story follows the strained, sexual relationship between Li'l Bit and her aunt's husband, Uncle Peck, from her pre-adolescence through her teenage years into college and beyond. Using the metaphor of driving and the issues of pedophilia, incest, and misogyny, the play explores the ideas of control and manipulation. == Plot synopsis == The play tells the story of a woman nicknamed Li'l Bit as she comes to terms with her sexually abusive relationship with her Uncle Peck throughout her adolescence. Aside from Li'l Bit and Uncle Peck, a Greek Chorus of three is on hand to play all of the other characters in their lives. The script is a memory play told largely out of chronological order, with the first scene taking place in 1969 in a parking lot in rural Maryland. Li'l Bit is 17 years old and sitting in Uncle Peck's car. Peck unhooks her brassiere through her shirt, an act that Li'l Bit finds uncomfortable. Li'l Bit mentions she is graduating high school and going to a \\"fancy college\\" in the fall, while Uncle Peck continues to admire her body. Li'l Bit breaks from this scene to describe her family to the audience. She explains her family's penchant for handing out nicknames based on genitalia, which is why she was branded with the alias Li'l Bit for life. This includes her alcoholic mother, the \\"titless wonder\\", her misogynistic grandfather \\"Big Papa\\", her submissive grandmother, and her young Cousin BB (Blue Balls). A typical family dinner in 1969 has Li'l Bit's family (played by the three Greek Chorus members) cracking jokes about how \\"well- endowed\\" she is. Peck is the only family member who supports Li'l Bit's dreams of going to school. Frustrated, Li'l Bit leaves the dinner after Grandfather goes too far with his insults. Peck's wife Mary (Li'l Bit's maternal aunt) asks him to comfort Li'l Bit, indicating that she (Mary) is ignorant of his abuse. Li'l Bit reveals that she eventually lost her scholarship and was expelled from college because of a drinking problem. She spent most of that year driving on highways, marveling at how well Peck had taught her to drive. She then has a memory of 1968, where Uncle Peck takes her to a fancy Eastern Shore restaurant as a reward for passing her driver's test on the first try. Peck slyly orders oysters and martinis for Li'l Bit to consume, while the girl's mother gives less than stellar advice on drinking alcohol. Li'l Bit and her mother both become increasingly drunk on martinis. Peck carries the drunk Li'l Bit to his car, where they discuss the nature of her relationship. Li'l Bit drunkenly kisses her uncle, but Peck refuses to go any further until she coherently says otherwise. Li'l Bit begins to question the appropriateness of her relationship with her Uncle. The Teenage Greek Chorus member briefly takes over to introduce a memory that is not Li'l Bit's. In a monologue, Uncle Peck gives the unseen Cousin BB a fishing lesson, where it is strongly implied that he uses this as a cover to molest the boy the same way he used driving to abuse Li'l Bit. Li'l Bit takes control once again to recount a conversation she had with her mother and grandmother about sex. Mother tries to be helpful in explaining topics such as orgasms and consent, while Grandmother wails that Li'l Bit is too young to know about sex and uses scare tactics to keep her from doing it until she is married. The adult Li'l Bit breaks the memory to explain that she went on to have a one-night stand with a high school senior while she was twenty-seven, experiencing the allure of young flesh that her uncle once felt. She then returns to the memory, which turns into an argument between Mother and the Grandparents. Unable to deal with that memory again, Li'l Bit changes the memory (as part of the driving metaphor, she likens this to changing stations on the radio) to when Uncle Peck first taught her how to start up a car. Showing that he does have genuine concern for Li'l Bit beyond her body, Peck gives reasonable advice on how to be safe on the road. Li'l Bit becomes confused as to how Peck could abuse her while still being helpful. The next scene is a series of vignettes on Li'l Bit's school days in 1966, where she faced ridicule and sexual harassment from the other students on account of her large breasts. A boy asks her to dance at a school sock hop, but Li'l Bit refuses, believing he just wants to see her breasts \\"jiggle\\" while she dances. The scenes shifts to 1965, where Uncle Peck takes provocative \\"pin-up\\" photos of Li'l Bit. Aunt Mary takes the stage to defend her husband's actions to the audience. She claims that he is a good man, and that it is all Li'l Bit's fault for leading him on. She believes that her marriage can be saved as soon as her niece goes off to college. On Christmas Day 1964, 13-year-old Li'l Bit helps Uncle Peck wash the dishes. Li'l Bit questions where Peck was during Thanksgiving, implying that he entered a rehab for his alcoholism. Peck reveals that drinking helped him deal with a hidden pain that no one, not even Aunt Mary, could fix. Li'l Bit offers to spend one day a week with Uncle Peck, so long as he never \\"crosses a line\\". This is how the driving lessons begin. The scene flashes forward to 1969, Li'l Bit's freshman year of college. The Greek Chorus lists the letters and gifts that Peck sends her, with each note counting down how many days are left until her 18th birthday. Startled by how unhinged her uncle has become, Li'l Bit arranges a meeting in a Philadelphia hotel room on December 10, 1969. Li'l Bit yells at Uncle Peck for becoming so possessive, while he insists that his niece is the love of his life. Li'l Bit reveals that the years of trauma from Peck has finally caught up with her, leading to her not focusing in school and failing her courses. After he kneels and proposes to Li'l Bit, vowing to divorce Aunt Mary, Li'l Bit turns him down and cuts him out of her life for good. She never sees Peck again after she leaves the hotel room. Li'l Bit returns to the present to explain what became of Peck after she left: He turned to alcohol after years of sobriety, leading to the loss of his job, his marriage, and his driver's license. He went on to die after drunkenly falling down a flight of stairs in his basement. Li'l Bit reflects on why her uncle may have molested her, wondering if someone did it to him when he was a child. Li'l Bit has one more memory to share: the summer of 1962. An 11-year-old Li'l Bit fights with her mother about going on a seven-hour car trip to the beach with Uncle Peck. Mother is wary of him, but finally relents, telling Li'l Bit that she holds her responsible for any misdeeds. Li'l Bit sits in the car with Uncle Peck, only she doesn't speak her lines out loud. The Teenage Greek Chorus, acting as young Li'l Bit, does so. Peck molests his niece for the first time. The script then returns to the present. Li'l Bit reflects on how she is ready to move on with her life, and that despite everything she has been through, she can thank her Uncle Peck for one thing: the freedom she feels when she drives. The final scene has Li'l Bit alone in her car, and as she adjusts her rear view mirror, she notices Uncle Peck in the back. After smiling at him, she steps on the gas pedal and drives away, finally leaving Peck in the past as she drives off to a new chapter of her life. ==Background== Vogel wrote the play at the Perseverance Theatre, Alaska, where she was in residence.Vogel, Paula. \\"First Person.

Li'l Bit (Mary-Louise Parker) and Uncle Peck (David Morse) are painted with the delicate brush strokes of a sumi painting, more subtle than sensational, and as unstereotypical a victim and victimizer as Lolita and Humbert Humbert (from Nabokov's Lolita which the playwright credits as her inspiration)...Before I say one more word, this is one of the must-see events of the season...\\"Sommer, Elyse. \\"Review of How I Learned to Drive CurtainUp, accessed August 14, 2019 The Baltimore Sun reviewer wrote of the 1998 Center Stage production: \\"The surprising gift Vogel has given her two main characters is that, instead of labeling them good and evil, or victim and criminal, she treats them both with respect.\\" Ben Brantley, in his The New York Times review of the original 1997 production, wrote: \\"The scrambled chronology, which suggests the ways memories attack by stealth and out of sequence, makes it harder for the audience to form conventional judgments. More surprisingly, it clarifies the patterns in the relationship between niece and uncle: of degrees of responsibility, feelings of guilt and shifts in power. Ms. Vogel is too intelligent to present this simply as a study in victim versus villain or to fail to acknowledge that what's happening is, in some appalling way, a real love story.\\" Brantley, in his The New York Times review of the 2012 Second Stage production, wrote: \\"It is a performance that captures Ms. Vogel's remarkable, clear-eyed empathy in portraying the incalculable damage done by damaged people\\". == Awards and nominations == * The Pulitzer Prize for Drama (1998)\\"Paula Vogel\\" pulitzer.org, retrieved May 10, 2017 * Off-Broadway Lucille Lortel Awards (1997) ** Outstanding Play ** Outstanding Director (Mark Brokaw) ** Outstanding Actress (Mary-Louise Parker) ** Outstanding Actor (David Morse) * Drama Desk Awards (1997) ** Outstanding Play ** Outstanding Actor in a Play ** Outstanding Director of a Play * Obie Award (1996‚Äì1997) ** Performance, David Morse ** Performance, Mary-Louise Parker ** Direction ** Playwrighting * Outer Critics Circle Award ** Outstanding Off-Broadway Play * New York Drama Critics Award ** Best Play Source: ==Notes== ==References== * * ==External links== *How I Learned to Drive Internet Off-Broadway Database * The Boston Phoenix interview, May 1998 * SET Groups Performance of \\"How I Learned to Drive\\", June 2010 Category:Fiction set in the 1960s Category:1997 plays Category:Obie Award-winning plays Category:Plays by Paula Vogel Category:Plays set in Maryland Category:Pulitzer Prize for Drama-winning works Category:Child sexual abuse in fiction ","title":"How I Learned to Drive"},{"id":"1268739","text":"A Wide Awakes parade in Lower Manhattan, one of a series of political rallies held in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Cleveland, and Boston during the first week of October 1860. The Wide Awakes were a youth organization and, later, a paramilitary organization cultivated by the Republican Party during the 1860 presidential election in the United States. Using popular social events, an ethos of competitive fraternity, and even promotional comic books, the organization introduced many to political participation and proclaimed themselves the newfound voice of younger voters. The structured, militant Wide Awakes appealed to a generation profoundly shaken by the partisan instability of the 1850s and offered young northerners a much-needed political identity. ==Overview == In early March, 1860, Abraham Lincoln spoke in Hartford, Connecticut opposing the spread of slavery and advocating for the right of workers to strike. Five store clerks, who had started a Republican group called the Wide Awakes, decided to join a parade for Lincoln, who delighted in the torchlight escort back to his hotel provided for him after his speech. Over the ensuing weeks, the Lincoln campaign made plans to develop Wide Awakes throughout the country and to use them to spearhead large voter registration drives, knowing that new voters and young voters tend to embrace new and young parties. Members of the Wide Awakes were described by The New York Times as\\"...young men of character and energy, earnest in their Republican convictions and enthusiastic in prosecuting the canvass on which we have entered.\\" In Chicago on October 3, 1860, 10,000 Wide Awakes marched in a three-mile procession. The story of this rally occupied eight columns of the Chicago Tribune. In Indiana, as one historian reports: > 1860 was the most colorful in the memory of the Hoosier electorate. > ‚ÄúSpeeches, day and night, torch-light processions, and all kinds of noise > and confusion are the go, with all parties,‚Äù commented the ‚Äúindependent‚Äù > Indianapolis Locomotive. Congressman Julian too was impressed by the > ‚Äúcontrivance and spectacular display‚Äù which prevailed in the current > canvass. Each party took unusual pains to mobilize its followers in > disciplined political clubs, but the most remarkable of these were the > Lincoln ‚ÄúRail Maulers‚Äù and ‚ÄúWide Awakes,‚Äù whose organizations extended > throughout the state. Clad in gaudy uniforms the members of these quasi- > military bands participated in all Republican demonstrations. The ‚ÄúWide > Awakes‚Äù in particular were well drilled and served as political police in > escorting party speakers and in preserving order at public meetings. Party > emulation made every political rally the occasion for carefully arranged > parades through banner-bedecked streets, torchlight processions, elaborate > floats and transparencies, blaring bands, and fireworks.Kenneth Stampp, > Indiana Politics During the Civil War (1949) p 45 By the midpoint of the 1860 campaign, Republicans bragged that they had Wide Awake chapters in every county of every Northern (free) state. By the day of Lincoln's election as president there were 500,000 members. The group remained active for several decades. ==Rituals== Old Capitol building, Springfield, Illinois ===Uniform and tactics=== The standard Wide Awake uniform consisted of a full robe or cape, a black glazed hat, and a torch six feet in length to which a large, flaming, pivoting whale-oil container was mounted. Its activities were conducted primarily in the evening and consisted of several night-time torch-lit marches through cities in the northeast and border states. The Wide Awakes adopted the image of a large eyeball as their standard banner. ===Chapter organization=== Little is known about the national organization of the Wide Awakes, if indeed any formal governing body existed at all. The clubs seem to have been organized by city into local chapters. Surviving minutes of the Waupun, Wisconsin Wide Awakes chapter restrict membership to males age 18 and older. The member had to \\"furnish himself with the style of uniform adopted by this Club.\\" The chapter had a military-style officer system consisting of a Captain and 1st through 4th Lieutenants. > The Captain shall have command of the Club at all times; in his absence the > Lieutenants shall have command in the order of their rank. Every member of > this club shall attend all the meetings whether regular or special; and when > on duty or in attendance at the meetings, shall obey the officers in > command, and shall at all times perform such duties as shall be required of > him by the officers in command.The Waupun Times, August 1, 1860 ===Social dimensions=== Whatever their names marching clubs of both parties often had bands and fancy uniforms. The social dimensions have been described:Glenn C. Altschuler and Stuart M. Blumin; Rude Republic: Americans and Their Politics in the Nineteenth Century Princeton University Press, 2000 p. 63 > The young men and boys who joined the Wide-Awakes, Invincibles, and other > marching clubs were sold inexpensive uniforms and taught impressive march > maneuvers.

The following example comes from the Chicago Chapter:Franklin, Pennsylvania Repository and Transcript #To act as a political police. #To do escort duty to all prominent Republican speakers who visit our place to address our citizens. #To attend all public meetings in a body and see that order is kept and that the speaker and meeting is not disturbed. #To attend the polls and see that justice is done to every legal voter. #To conduct themselves in such a manner as to induce all Republicans to join them. #To be a body joined together in large numbers to work for the good of the Republican Ticket. === Membership certificate === A membership certificate for the Wide-Awake Club: ‚ÄúFree speech, free soil, free men. This is to certify that ... is a member of the ... Wide-Awake Club‚Äù The membership certificate of the Wide-Awake Club has a central vignette showing crowds and troops before the U. S. Capitol. Some of the troops march in long parade lines, others fire cannons into the air toward the Capitol. Crowds line the Capitol steps, flanking a lone figure, probably Abraham Lincoln, who ascends toward the building's entrance. The certificate is framed by an American flag draped over a rail fence, with olive branches at the top. In the upper corners are oval medallions of Abraham Lincoln (left) and running mate Hannibal Hamlin (right). Rail-splitter's mallets appear in the corners. A vigilant eye peers from a halo of clouds at the center. On either side stand uniformed members of the society, wearing their characteristic short capes and visored caps. One holds a staff and a lantern (left), and the other holds a burning torch. Below, an eagle on a shield holds a streamer ‚ÄúE Pluribus Unum,‚Äù arrows, and olive branch. Broken shackles lie before him. In the left distance, the sun rises over a mountainous landscape and a locomotive chugs across the plains. On the right is a more industrial scene: an Eastern city with its harbor full of boats. In the foreground a man hammers a wedge into a wooden rail.Library of Congress: Free speech, free soil, free men This is to certify that ... is a member ... ==Stone's Prairie Riot== In August 1860 a political rally was scheduled to be held at Stone's Prairie in Adams County, Illinois, near the modern village of Plainville.Iris A. Nelson and Walter S. Waggoner, The Stone's Prairie Riot of 1860, Journal of Illinois History, Vol. 5, p. 19 (Spring 2002) This area, in far western Illinois, was familiar to two of the presidential candidates. Although the Republican candidate, Abraham Lincoln, was known in the area, his Democratic opponent, Stephen Douglas, had practiced law nearby. In addition to local animosity, Adams County was close to the border with Missouri, a slave state. The rally was organized by the Republicans. When it was initially announced, there was an invitation to Democratic speakers. Although the invitation was later withdrawn, this fact was not widely disseminated, resulting in confusion as to whether this was to be a Republican rally, or a debate between Republican and Democratic supporters. During the 1860 campaign, it was a common practice for settlements to raise poles, as much as 150 feet (50 meters) high. The political parties hung flags, and effigies of the candidates they opposed, from the poles. On the way to the rally, the Quincy Wide Awakes passed through Payson, the residents of which had erected a pole with an offensive effigy of Lincoln astride a rail. The Wide Awakes, however, carried a banner with an equally offensive depiction of a drunken Douglas falling over a pile of rails. An early confrontation was avoided, with the Wide Awakes proceeding to Stone's Creek. The August 25, 1860, rally involved around 7000 participants. Democrats appeared, expecting to hear their candidates in a debate. They were instead treated to a podium of Republicans, whom they heckled. The Wide Awakes defended the speakers, and a general melee resulted, involving several hundred men. After the rally, the Wide Awakes returned through Payson, where they found a hundred Democrats guarding their pole. Although Wide Awakes avoided confrontation, shots were fired at them while leaving town. The Wide Awakes' flag was pierced by shots, and several were reported to have been injured. ==Southern reaction== In 1860, Texas Senator Louis T. Wigfall alleged, falsely, that Wide Awakes were behind a wave of arson and vandalism in his home state of Texas. Historians have found no evidence whatever of any such conspiracy, but they do report that in Texas, in 1860, a statewide hysteria over nonexistent slave revolts led to the lynching of 30-100 slaves and whites in the so-called Texas Troubles.Texas Troubles Another forty-one suspected Unionists were hanged by vigilantes in Texas in 1862 The Wide Awakes never marched anywhere in the South, in 1860, but they represented the South's greatest fear, an oppressive force bent on marching down to their lands, liberating the slaves and pushing aside their way of life. Their outfits and equipment only further incited this fear with beliefs that ‚Äúthey parade at midnight, carry rails to break open our doors, torches to fire our dwellings, and beneath their long black capes the knife to cut our throats‚Äù.Richmond Enquirer ‚Äì September 28, 1860 (Valley of the Shadow) To the South, the Wide Awakes were only a taste of what was to come if Lincoln were to be elected. The North would not compromise, and would, if need be, force themselves upon the great South. \\"One ‚Äìhalf million of men uniformed and drilled, and the purpose of their organization to sweep the country in which I live with fire and sword.\\"Louis T. Wigfall ‚Äì December 6, 1860 (Great Debates in American History) This mindset was not appeased by the wide acceptance of the Wide Awakes in the North. On October 25, 1858, Senator Seward of New York stated to an excited crowd, \\"a revolution has begun\\" and alluded to Wide Awakes as \\"forces with which to recover back again all the fields ... and to confound and overthrow, by one decisive blow, the betrayers of the constitution and freedom forever.\\" To the South, the Wide Awakes and the North, would only be content when the South was fully dominated. The South recognized the need for their own Wide Awakes, and thus started a movement to create \\"a counteracting organization in the South,\\"Marshal Texan Republican ‚Äì November 17, 1860 (Valley of the Shadow) dubbed the \\"Minutemen.\\" The South viewed the Wide Awakes as the North's private army, and thus they determined on creating their own. They would no longer entertain the \\"abhorrence of the rapine, murder, insurrection, pollution and incendiarism which have been plotted by the deluded and vicious of the North, against the chastity, law and prosperity of innocent and unoffending citizens of the South.\\"Indiana Courier ‚Äì October 27, 1860 (Valley of the Shadow) The Minutemen were the South's unofficial army. Like that of the Wide Awakes, they were expected \\"to form an armed body of men ... whose duty is to arm, equip and drill, and be ready for any emergency that may arise in the present perilous position of Southern States.\\"The Constitutional Union ‚Äì November 16, 1860 (Valley of the Shadow) The fear of the Wide Awakes resulted in Minutemen companies forming all over the South. Like their enemy, they too held torch rallies and wore their own uniforms, complete with an official badge of \\"a blue rosette ... to be worn upon the side of the hat.\\" ==Wartime activities== After Lincoln called out all the militia in April 1861, the Republican Wide Awakes, the Democratic \\"Douglas Invincibles,\\" and other parade groups volunteered en masse for the Union army. In 1864, reports of political rallies note that \\"The Northwestern Wide Awakes, the Great Western Light Guard Band, and the 24th Illinois Infantry\\" were at a Chicago meeting. On November 5, the Chicago Union Campaign Committee (the name of Lincoln's party that year) declared: > \\"On Tuesday next the destiny of the American Republic is to be settled. We > appeal to Union men. We appeal to merchants to close their stores, > manufacturers to permit their clerks and laborers to go to the polls, the > Board of Trade to close, the Union Leagues and Wide Awakes to come out. The > rebellion must be put down.\\"Philip Kinsley; The Chicago Tribune: Its First > Hundred Years 1943, p. 348, 349 ==Defense of St. Louis== In early 1861, the Wide Awakes chapter of St. Louis became involved in paramilitary operations at the outbreak of the Civil War.Struggle for St. Louis; by Anthony Mondachello Aided by Francis Preston Blair, Jr. and army Captain Nathaniel Lyon, the St. Louis Wide Awakes smuggled armaments into the city and trained secretly in a warehouse. The purpose was to prepare them for defense of the federal St. Louis Arsenal, which Confederate supporters wanted to seize. Lyon employed his political connections through Blair to obtain an appointment as commanding officer over the arsenal and, having received his promotion, promptly moved the St. Louis Wide Awakes into the arsenal under cover of night. Lyon's Wide Awakes, newly mustered into the Federal army, were used on May 10, 1861 to arrest a division of the Missouri State Militia near St. Louis in what would become known as the Camp Jackson Affair. As the captured militia men were marched toward the arsenal later that day a riot erupted in which scores of civilians were shot or killed. This event marked the effective beginning of Civil War violence in Missouri. == 2020 Wide Awakes == In early 2020, a collective of artists including Hank Willis Thomas, Jos√© Parl√°, Kambui Olujimi, Anya Ayoung-Chee, Fab 5 Freddy, Rujeko Hockley, Eric Gottesman and many others, looking to the history of the 1860s organization, created a new organization and online network of the same name, and in the spirit of the \\"the nonviolent, entertaining, visionary work that they were trying to do.\\" The Sunrise Movement performed Wide Awake demonstrations in the summer of 2020. ==See also== * History of the United States Republican Party * American election campaigns in the 19th century ==References== Sources * Paul F.

The participants in any economic system must belong to a trading network to obtain the products they cannot produce efficiently for themselves. Any change in such a network affects other participants on the network, so that the demand for various products and the incomes of the participants are interdependent. A. A. Cournot wrote in Mathematical Researches into the theory of Wealth \\"...the economic system is a whole in which all of the parts are connected and react on one another. An increase in the income of the producers of commodity A will affect the demand for commodities B, C, etc. and the incomes of their producers, and by their reaction will affect the demand for commodity A.\\" Such complex reactions are evident in general equilibrium theory. The economic interdependence of nations has been studied extensively by professors all around the world. Such an international economic interaction is commonly thought of as a dollar value of the transaction of goods and services between nations (Cooper); several academics have challenged this fundamental paradigm over time. Baldwin suggests that economic interdependence may be conceived as the opportunity costs incurred from potential exit costs that incur as a result of breaking existing economic ties between nations. Whitman, cited by Baldwin, further expands on Cooper's definition and proposes that economic interdependence should also involve the degree of sensitivity of a country‚Äôs economic behaviour to policies and development of countries outside its border. However, empirical evidence to support the latter definition is a lot harder to find, given its ambiguity (Baldwin). Global economic interdependence has grown exponentially in the span of a generation, as a result of great technological progress and associated policies that were aimed at opening national economies internally and externally to global competition. Paehlke notes that investment and international trade have drastically increased over the last 100 of years except during the World War I and World War II. Over time, economic interdependence has incorporated other aspects that were brought about by contemporary globalisation - as a result of the onset of the age of computerisation, telecommunications and low-cost travel and shipping. As international trade have been increasing at a rate beyond 8% during the 1950s to 1970s, and has also been driven by improvements in information technology in the 1990s, economic interdependence between countries has increased even more rapidly. Given such rapid increase in international trade and capital flows that are traditionally associated with globalisation, there has been increasing interest in the issues of financial and economic interdependence, partly driven by the contagion that resulted from the financial crisis. == Approaches to measure international economic interdependence == As economic interdependence may be perceived differently depending on the scale and context involved, various methods are used to measure the degree of interdependence between and within countries. The below documents some of the approaches that have been adopted to measure the degree of economic interdependence. === Hierarchical Network Approach === This approach is based on the precept that globalisation increases the integration and interdependence between the economy of different countries. The Hierarchical Network Approach is used to measure economic interdependence by analysing growth clusters and cross-country liaison, and business cycle synchronisations. The cross-country liaison or economic interaction between countries or states is most commonly measured by Pearson's cross-correlation coefficient. The correlation matrix is a methodical method which exhibits the mutual relationship of countries over a specified time period. To measure growth clusters, economists need to get hold and analyse changes in GDP for each country over a specified period of time. The relationship between interdependence and business cycles is calculated by the distance correlation matrices over a period of 10 years. The combination of results from the data presents the economic interdependence of countries over time. By this measure, trends from the data has shown that the degree of world economic interdependence is growing due to globalisation. === Geopolitical Approach === Another way of measuring the degree of economic interdependence is via a geopolitical approach, which is based on the presumption that economic interdependence may exist because states trade with each other to obtain strategic goods that are needed for national industry and defence. The geopolitical approach is based on both vertical and horizontal interdependence. Vertical interdependence measures how a change in the price of a good in Country X will affect Country Y (or how changes in price in State A will affect State B), whilst horizontal interdependence calculates the degree of bilateral trade, transactions and investment involved between both countries. Both vertical and horizontal interdependence data must be used to measure economic interdependence. This is because that in the given situation that there is a high correlation of vertical interdependence between country X and country Y, if there is no horizontal interdependence (transaction of goods, services or capitals) between both countries, country X and country Y will have little/no economic interdependence. Vertical interdependence without horizontal may arise due to other factors such as changes in worldwide economic forces. For instance, consider the case of trade and the flow of factors among Arab states (which is typically very limited); whilst we observe parallel movements in factor prices, this may just be due to the effect of global market forces that affect all economies in the same fashion. === Exit Model Approach === As suggested by Baldwin and Crescenzi, economic interdependence may be modelled as a function of potential economic exit costs, which may deter, motivate or fail to affect political conflict. A key challenge that is faced is the need for a valid method to measure exit costs and interdependence, whilst maintaining a systematic approach with many countries involved (a large-n analysis). Crescenzi addresses this by interacting bilateral price elasticity data with trade activity data, to represent both market structure and the intensity of potential economic exit costs. Whilst the price elasticity data reflects one state's ability to react to economic change that is initiated by another state, its interaction with trade share data is vital as it indicates how intense the interdependent relationship is relative to each state's economy and trade portfolio within the global market. Given these two components, Crescenzi furthers his study by explaining the relationship between economic interdependence and its association with political conflict. ==References== Category:International macroeconomics ","title":"Economic interdependence"},{"id":"1268787","text":"Is Everybody Listening? is a live album by the English rock band Supertramp, released in 2001. == Overview == Is Everybody Listening? is credited as being the 1976 recording of a concert that took place in Cleveland, Ohio.

Its subject is King Leopold's rule over the Congo Free State. A work of political satire harshly condemnatory of his actions, it ostensibly recounts a fiction monologue of Leopold II speaking in his own defense. == Content == King Leopold II raves madly about the good things that he says he has done for the people of the Congo Free State, including the disbursement of millions on religion and art. He says he had come to Congo with piety \\"oozing\\" from \\"every pore\\", that he had only wanted to convert the people to Christianity, that he had wanted to stop the slave trade. Leopold II says that he did not take any of the government money, that he did not use the revenues as his personal \\"swag\\", and that such claims by the \\"meddlesome American missionaries\\", \\"frank British consuls\\", and \\"blabbing Belgian-born traitors\\" are wholly false. He asserts that for a king to be criticized as he has been is blasphemy‚Äîsurely, under the rule of God, any king who was not doing God's will would not have been helped by God. The book mentions the critical report by the missionary William Henry Sheppard on an 1899 massacre of over 80 people by Zappo Zaps sent to collect taxes. Leopold claims that his critics only speak of what is unfavorable to him, such as the unfair taxes that he levied upon the people of the Congo, which caused starvation and the extermination of entire villages, but not of the fact that he had sent missionaries to the villages to convert them to Christianity.page 7-8/ facsimile of the original 1st edition.

Its campus sits on the banks of the Huron River, about ten minutes outside downtown Ann Arbor. Concordia is affiliated with the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod (LCMS) and is a college of the Concordia University System. CUAA merged with Concordia University Wisconsin, located in Mequon, Wisconsin, in 2013. Concordia University Ann Arbor has approximately 1,000 students, with a student-faculty ratio of about 11 to 1. Concordia offers over 70 areas of study, graduate programs, a set of adult education programs, and a variety of study-abroad activities. ==History== Earhart Manor on the Concordia campusIn the early 1960s, the LCMS purchased the Earhart Manor and surrounding estate in Ann Arbor and began construction of Concordia Lutheran Junior College. The campus was designed by architect Vincent Kling in a mid-century modern style. Classes began in the fall of 1964 with 234 students and 24 instructors. The school began offering four-year degree programs in 1976 and changed its name to Concordia College. It assumed its current name in 2001.Chapel of the Holy Trinity In 1977, Concordia began performing the \\"Boars Head Festival\\", an annual Christmas celebration filled with song, music, and drama; much beloved by current students, alumni, and community members. From 1993 to 1995, it was the home of Accordion Magazine, which has since been resurrected under the name Arbor Light Magazine. In the 2000s, the university experienced \\"a number of financial, enrollment and administrative difficulties\\" that prompted it to enter into discussions with Concordia University Wisconsin about a possible merger. The merger became effective on July 1, 2013, with Curt Gielow, former executive dean of CUW‚Äôs School of Pharmacy and former mayor of Mequon, becoming Vice President of Administration and Chief Campus Officer at CUAA. He was replaced at the end of 2018 by Ryan Peterson. In 2015, the university purchased the former Ann Arbor campus of the Thomas M. Cooley Law School. That facility, north of the main campus, is now the home of CUAA's School of Nursing. ==Campus photographs== Image:choirchapel.jpgChoir singing in the Chapel of the Holy Trinity File:Chapel Concordia University Michigan.jpgThrough central campus ==Athletics== CUAA athletic teams are known as the Cardinals.

It is the only member of the genus Chrysolampis. It is a seasonal migrant, although its movements are not well understood. This hummingbird inhabits open country, gardens and cultivation. It is 8.1 cm long and weighs 3.5 g. Compared to most other hummingbirds, the almost straight, black bill is relatively short. The male has green-glossed dark brown upperparts. The crown and nape are glossy red, and the throat and breast are brilliant golden- orange. The rest of the underparts are brown, and the chestnut tail is tipped black. The male often looks very dark, until he turns and the brilliant colours flash in the sunlight. The female ruby-topaz hummingbird has bronze- green upperparts and pale grey underparts. The tail is chestnut with a dark subterminal band and a white tip. Females from Trinidad typically have a greenish throat-streak (it may appear dark), but this is not common elsewhere in its range. Juvenile females are similar to adult females, but with a white- tipped dusky-brown tail. Juvenile males resemble the juvenile female, but with a variable amount of iridescent orange to the throat. The female ruby-topaz hummingbird lays two eggs in a tiny cup nest in the fork of a low branch. Incubation takes 16 days, and fledging another 18 or 19. The food of this species is nectar, taken from a wide variety of flowers, and some small insects. Ruby-topaz hummingbird males perch conspicuously and defend their territories aggressively. The call of this species is a high-pitched tsip. == Etymology == Chrysolampis is of Greek origin and derives from khrusolampis œáœÅœÖœÉŒøŒªŒ±ŒºœÄŒπœÇ for glow-worm.

Click for more details. A skew-T log-P diagram is one of four thermodynamic diagrams commonly used in weather analysis and forecasting. In 1947, N. Herlofson proposed a modification to the emagram that allows straight, horizontal isobars and provides for a large angle between isotherms and dry adiabats, similar to that in the tephigram. It was thus more suitable for some of the newer analysis techniques being invented by the United States Air Force. Such a diagram has pressure plotted on the vertical axis, with a logarithmic scale (thus the \\"log-P\\" part of the name), and the temperature plotted skewed, with isothermal lines at 45¬∞ to the plot (thus the \\"skew-T\\" part of the name). Plotting a hypothetical set of measurements with constant temperature for all altitudes would result in a line angled 45¬∞ to the right. In practice, since temperature usually drops with altitude, the graphs are usually mostly vertical (see examples linked to below). The major use for skew-T log-P diagrams is the plotting of radiosonde soundings, which give a vertical profile of the temperature and dew point temperature throughout the troposphere and lower stratosphere. The isopleths on the diagram can then be used to simplify many tedious calculations involved, which were previously performed by hand or not at all. Many skew-T log-P diagrams also include a vertical representation of the wind speed and direction using wind barbs. Important atmospheric characteristics such as saturation, atmospheric instability, and wind shear are critical in severe weather forecasting, by which skew-T log-P diagrams allow quick visual analysis. The diagrams are widely used by glider pilots to forecast the strength of thermals and the height of the base of the associated cumulus clouds. == See also == * Thermodynamic diagrams * Tephigram * Emagram * St√ºve diagram * Meteogram == Bibliography == * * * == External links == * Downloadable/printable skew-T log-P diagrams in PDF format * NOAA observed sounding archive * Printable blank skew-T log-P diagrams in multiple densities * on-line course about skew-T Category:Diagrams Category:Atmospheric thermodynamics ","title":"Skew-T log-P diagram"},{"id":"1268841","text":"Roland Carroll Jordan, Jr (born 1938) is an American composer and music theorist.

DNA evidence can have tremendous utility for sexual assault investigations and prosecution by identifying offenders, revealing serial offenders through DNA matches across cases, and exonerating those who have been wrongly accused.Campbell, R., Fehler-Cabral, G., Bybee, D., & Shaw, J. (2017).\\"Forgotten evidence: A mixed methods study of why sexual assault kits (SAKs) are not submitted for DNA forensic testing\\". Law and Human Behavior, 41 (5), 454-467. The kit was developed in Chicago in the mid 1970s, in order to provide a more uniform protocol for evidence collection after sexual assaults. While Louis R. Vitullo is frequently credited as the developer of the first kit, it was originally researched and proposed to Vitullo by Martha 'Marty' Goddard, who was a victim advocate and founder of Chicago‚Äôs Citizens for Victims Assistance organization, and herself a sexual assault survivor. For years, the standardized tool was referred to as a Vitullo kit. Today it is colloquially referred to as a rape test kit or a rape kit, which is used interchangeably to refer to the specific evidence that is obtained through the use of the rape kit. ==Description and use== Medical professionals learn how to use a rape kit at Camp Phoenix near Kabul, Afghanistan. ===Kit contents=== A rape kit consists of small boxes, microscope slides and plastic bags for collecting and storing evidence such as clothing fibers, hairs, saliva, blood, semen or body fluid. Rape kits vary by location, but commonly include the following items:Hess, Amanda (April 9, 2010). \\"Test Case: You're Not a Rape Victim Unless Police Say So\\" . Washington City Paper. Page 2 of 3 *Instructions *Bags and sheets for evidence collection *Swabs for collecting fluids from the lips, cheeks, thighs, vagina, anus, and buttocks *Sterile urine collection containers *Sterile sample containers *Blood collection devices *Comb used to collect hair and fiber from the victim‚Äôs body *Clear glass slides *Self-sealing envelopes for preserving the victim‚Äôs clothes, head hair, pubic hair, and blood samples *Nail pick for scraping debris from beneath the nails *White sheets to catch physical evidence stripped from the body *Documentation forms *Labels *Sterile water and saline ===Examiners=== Rape kit examinations are performed by medical professionals, most commonly physicians and nurses. In some locations, examiners have received special training on performing sexual assault forensic exams. For example, many hospitals and health facilities in the United States and Canada have sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs) who are trained to collect and preserve forensic evidence and to offer emotional support to the victim. According to the International Association of Forensic Nurses, the number of SANE programs has steadily increased throughout the world since its introduction in the United States in the 1970s. As of 2016, over 700 SANE programs exist in the United States, Canada, and Australia. SANEs were introduced in the United Kingdom in 2001. Japan has had a limited number of SANEs since as early as 2007. ===Evidence collection=== The process of collecting a rape kit is highly invasive and extremely time-consuming. The physical examination begins with the victim disrobing while standing on a large sheet of butcher paper, which collects any trace evidence that may fall from the victim's body or clothes. The victim's clothing is carefully examined for trace evidence before each garment is individually packaged with sheets of paper between folds to protect against cross-contamination. Examiners then collect biological samples of semen, blood, saliva and other bodily fluids by swabbing the victim's genitals, rectum, mouth and body surfaces. Examiners also collect fingernail scrapings and pluck head and pubic hairs. If the facility has the means, and the victim consents, the examiner will also take photographs of genital injuries using a colposcope. In addition to facilitating the collection of biological samples and injuries, the kit guides the documentation of the victim's medical history, emotional state, and account of the assault. The entire process of collecting the rape kit takes between 2.5 and 5 hours to complete.Hess, Amanda (April 7, 2010). \\"What's In A Rape Kit?\\". Washington City Paper. While the exam is going on, the victim has the right at any point to ask questions or stop the examination completely. ===Testing=== Upon completion, the rape kit is sealed and typically transferred to local law enforcement. In the United States, if the victim is undecided about reporting the rape, the kit may instead be stored at the exam facility or at a law enforcement facility as an \\"anonymous\\" kit. The law enforcement agency conducting the rape investigation can send the rape kit, in whole or in part, to the forensic science crime lab for analysis. Forensic scientists will try to develop a DNA profile of the assailant using the samples collected in the rape kit. If successful, the crime lab will search the DNA profile against DNA profiles of convicted offenders and other crime scenes using a DNA database. For example, crime labs in the United States run DNA profiles through the three-tiered Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), which was developed in 1990 and contains DNA profiles at the national, state, and local level. Similarly, the need to solve sexual assault crimes in Brazil led the Forensic DNA Research Institute of Federal District Civil Police to create a DNA database in 1998 containing evidence specifically collected in sexual assault cases. DNA matches in such databases not only aid in identifying the assailant where unknown to the victim, but also may help determine whether the assailant (known or unknown to the victim) is a serial rapist. These findings eventually may be made available for use in court. In some cases, the rape kit does not yield DNA evidence and the forensic scientist is unable to develop a DNA profile of the assailant. This may be because the assailant did not leave DNA behind, or too much time passed before the victim had a rape kit exam performed, or the rape kit evidence may have been improperly collected, stored or handled. Damaged evidence is something that is common among rape kits because survivors of sexual assault typically desire to wash themselves as soon as possible following an attack. Prior to the exam, it is desired that patients avoid using the rest room, combing their hair, bathing, changing their clothes or cleaning up the scene of the assault. Most evidence needs to be collected within 72 hours to be viable, and patients are advised to either bring or wear the clothing they had on when attacked to the exam. ==Influence on sexual assault cases== Rape kit evidence can aid the criminal rape investigation and the prosecution of a suspected assailant. It may also be used to exonerate the wrongly accused. The benefit of rape kit evidence depends in part on the character of the assault. ===Stranger cases=== In stranger sexual assault cases, the assailant is unknown to the victim. In such cases, rape kits may be instrumental in identifying the assailant through DNA profiling, which research suggests may help lead to an arrest. For example, a 2009 study examining sexual assault cases from two of 389 crime laboratories in the United States found that stranger-rape cases with forensic evidence were 24 times more likely to produce an arrest than stranger-rape cases without forensic evidence. Stranger cases can take a longer time to identify the perpetrator because without forensic evidence, the case becomes significantly more difficult to prosecute. This is one of the main problems that many victims face when coming forward that they had been raped. ===Acquaintance rape=== The vast majority of sexual assaults are non-stranger (or \\"acquaintance\\") cases where the victim knows the assailant. While identifying a suspect is not at issue, the kit's forensic evidence can be used to confirm offender identity in acquaintance rape cases. The kits may also be used to determine whether the offender committed other crimes. In many acquaintance sexual assault cases, the accused assailant will defend the accusations as consensual encounters. In such cases, rape kit evidence that documents the victim's injuries, e.g., photographs of bruising, is a useful tool to corroborate allegations of non-consensual sexual contact. In cases where the victim suffers a serious injury, filing charges and reaching convictions is more likely. In other acquaintance cases, the assailant may deny that sexual intercourse occurred at all. In such cases, specimens that show either sperm or specific enzymes that are unique to seminal fluid (enzymes prostatic acid phosphates or acid phosphatase) can be used to prove sexual contact. ===Serial rape cases=== Serial rape is defined as an assailant that has raped two or more victims. Serial rape may involve sexual partner violence or non-partner sexual violence, and it may be in the same family, in the same or different regions of a city, or in different cities or states. DNA collected by rape kits can help lead to identifying and arresting a person guilty of serial rape. In both stranger and non-stranger sexual assault cases, DNA testing of rape kit evidence and DNA database hits help identify serial sexual assaults. For example, a 2016 study of 900 previously untested rape kits in Detroit, Michigan found 259 CODIS hits, which included stranger and non-stranger sexual assault DNA profiles. Sixty-nine of the hits were serial sexual assault hits, 15 of which were acquaintance (non-stranger) sexual assault cases. In a study analyzing the status of Brazil's DNA database in 2015, researchers found 223 matches related to 78 serial rapists. At the time, the DNA database contained 650 profiles from one type of analysis of samples collected in rape kits‚Äîmale autosomal STR profiles‚Äîand 420 profiles from a second type of analysis‚Äîcomplete 23Y-STR profiles. ==Barriers to use== ===Backlog=== Rape kit backlog refers to the problem of untested sexual assault kits. The problem is twofold: it involves both the issue of rape kits not being submitted to crime labs for testing and the related issue of crime labs not having enough resources to test all of the submitted kits. One cause of the backlog of rape kits being tested is detectives and/or prosecutors failing to request a DNA analysis. When someone fails to request a DNA analysis, the kit sits in a police evidence storage facility untested. A rape kit is considered backlogged when it is not submitted for analysis within 10 days of the evidence being submitted. A second cause of the backlog is crime laboratory facilities receiving the rape kits and not testing them in a timely manner. The Joyful Heart Foundation, an anti-sexual violence charity founded by actress and activist Mariska Hargitay, considers these kits backlogged when the kit is not analyzed within 30 days of it being sent to the lab. Conservative estimates indicate there are 200,000‚Äì400,000 untested rape kits in U.S. police departments, and large stockpiles of kits have been documented in over five dozen jurisdictions, sometimes totaling more than 10,000 untested rape kits in a single city. The federal DNA Initiative has helped state as well as local governments to increase the ability of their DNA laboratories and decrease backlogs. ===Destruction=== In some locations, rape kits are destroyed before ever being tested and sometimes without notifying the victim. For victims of sexual assault in the United States, for example, the length of time for which a kit can go untested may be shorter than the statute of limitations. Policies in some jurisdictions instruct that rape kits be destroyed as early as six months after they are initially stored. By contrast, the shortest statute of limitations in the US is 3 years, though many states do not have a statute of limitations for rape. Some states, including Washington and Idaho, have legislation in place that requires a tracking system allowing law enforcement, medical facilities, and survivors to check the status of kits throughout the entire process, from collection to analysis and final disposition, and for survivors to be notified if a decision is made not to test a kit or to its destruction. That is two and a half years prior to the expiration of the shortest statute of limitations on rape found in the United States. ===Inaccessibility=== Victims' access to rape kits is often limited. In many locations, the non-availability of rape kits prevents victims from obtaining medico-legal evidence that would otherwise aid in the criminal investigation and prosecution of their assailant. In Nigeria, for example, a study analyzing sexual assault in Ile-Ife found that the majority of victims went to the hospital within 24 hours of a sexual assault, but did not receive a forensic medical examination because rape kits have yet to be introduced in the country. In locations where rape kits are available, a lack of trained examiners may still impede the ability of victims to undergo timely sexual assault examinations. Shortages force victims to wait hours for an exam or to travel long distances in order to have a rape kit performed within the recommended 72 hour timeframe. These effects have been seen in Canada and rural America, where the shortage of examiners has recently been identified. Insufficiently trained examiners may also lead to deficiencies in rape kits. A study of rape kit collection in South Africa found that rape kits were sometimes inappropriately used, missing proper specimens, or missing necessary forms. The study recommended improved training of health care workers to overcome these deficiencies. ===Cost=== The cost of rape kits is a barrier to use in many locations where the victim is billed for the collection of forensic evidence. Collecting a rape kit reportedly costs upwards of $1000. In some countries, reimbursement for the cost is contingent on the victim reporting the crime to police. In Japan, for example, a sexual assault victim must pay for the rape kit upfront, but police will reimburse medical fees if the victim reports the assault. Victims of sexual assault in the United States faced similar hurdles until the 2005 reauthorization of Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which requires states to pay for the cost of the rape kit regardless of the victim's decision to report the assault to the police. Under the more recent 2013 VAWA reauthorization, which took effect in March 2015, victims also cannot be required to pay the upfront cost of the exam. States may still require victims to submit claims for the rape kit exams to their personal insurance providers, as long as they are not billed for a deductible or a copay. ==By country== ===Republic of Ireland=== In the Republic of Ireland, victims of rape and sexual assault receive a forensic exam in a Sexual Assault Treatment Unit (SATU). Evidence is sent to Forensics Science Ireland (FSI), based in the Phoenix Park. At the end of 2018, there was a backlog of 70 cases, and it was taking up to a year for results to be released. ===United States=== In the United States, rape kit costs, availability, proper implementation of the invasive exam, and backlogs have historically presented problems for victims of rape seeking justice.Carmon, Irin. \\"The Shocking Numbers on Untested Rape Kits\\"; Jezebel. August 12, 2010, August 12\\"Hargitay's Joyful Heart\\". TV Guide. October 18, 2010. Page 4.\\"Testing Justice\\". Human Rights Watch. May 31, 2009 As of May 2009 the federal Violence Against Women Act of 2005 went into effect, requiring state governments who wish to continue receiving federal funding to pay for \\"Jane Doe rape kits\\" or \\"anonymous rape tests\\". These tests allow victims too traumatized to go to the police to undergo the procedure at hospitals. The hospitals maintain the collected evidence in a sealed envelope identified only by a number, unless police access its contents upon the victim's decision to press charges. While the practice had been recommended by the Federal Bureau of Investigation since at least 1999, and was already followed at some health clinics, colleges and hospitals, and in the state of Massachusetts, many jurisdictions up until then refused to pay the estimated $800 cost of the rape examination without a police report filed by the victim. In 2011, the National Institute of Justice published a report, The Road Ahead: Unanalyzed Evidence in Sexual Assault Cases, providing an overview of deep problems nationwide and the contributing factors to ongoing bureaucratic difficulties. These backlogs and delays may lead to a lack of justice for victims, the report notes, and \\"in worst-case scenarios...lead to additional victimization by serial offenders or the incarceration of people wrongly convicted of a crime\\". Findings include: # As an indicator of how widespread this problem has become, \\"18 percent of unsolved alleged sexual assaults that occurred from 2002 to 2007 contained forensic evidence that was still in police custody (not submitted to a crime lab for analysis)\\" # One major challenge is that 43% of law enforcement agencies \\"do not have a computerized system for tracking forensic evidence, either in their inventory or after it is sent to the crime lab\\" # On average, 50‚Äì60% of kits test positive for biological material that does not belong to the victim # Survey responses indicated that there may be some misunderstanding of the value of biological evidence. Forty-four percent of the law enforcement agencies said that one of the reasons they did not send evidence to the lab was that a suspect had not been identified. Fifteen percent said that they did not submit evidence because \\"analysis had not been requested by a prosecutor\\". The federal government established the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) to share DNA matches among federal, state and local jurisdictions. The federal DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 and Debbie Smith Act authorizations in 2004 and 2008 provide additional funding to state and local jurisdictions to help clear their rape kit testing backlogs. As of 2014, the federal government estimates a nationwide backlog of 400,000 rape kits, including many from the 1990s when evidence was collected but not tested for DNA due to high costs and more primitive techniques available at the time. ===By state=== ====California==== According to a 2009 report by Human Rights Watch, Los Angeles, California has the largest known rape kit backlog in the United States, with at least 12,669 languishing in storage facilities of the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and 47 independent police departments in Los Angeles County, and \\"smaller, but not inconsiderable\\" backlogs residing at police crime labs. These backlogs consist of both kits stored in evidence storage facilities, for which DNA analysis is not requested by investigating detectives, and those submitted for testing at crime lab facilities, but which have not been tested in a timely manner. Although authorities have struggled to address the backlog problem, their attempts have reportedly been hampered by funding issues and politics. As a consequence of these backlogs, assault survivors are often not informed of the status of their rape kit or their case. ====Illinois==== Across Illinois, where law enforcement and prosecutors handle sex crimes differently, a police backlog of nearly 8,000 rape kits accumulated between 1995 and 2009, only 20% of which were tested. Effective September 1, 2010, The Illinois Senate's Sexual Assault Submissions Act (Senate Bill 3269) requires law enforcement agencies to submit all evidence collected by rape kits for laboratory analysis within 180 days after the effective date of October 15, 2010, with a written notice to the State Police. Illinois was the first state to adopt such a law, setting a precedent for other states to follow. As of January 1, 2011, the Illinois House of Representatives Bill 5976 addresses victims' confidentiality rights and the timely processing of rape kit evidence. Both bills passed the Illinois General Assembly unanimously, and were signed by Governor Pat Quinn.\\"Crime Summary: Chicago January-August 2010\\" . Chicago Police Department. 2010.

In 2007, the city opened a $290 million forensic biology lab. In 2015, the New York County District Attorney's Office announced that they would be awarding $38 million in grants to jurisdictions across the country in order to test backlogged rape kits. ====Texas==== In Texas, it is considered unnecessary to administer a rape kit after 72 hours following the attack, as it is considered unlikely for useful evidence to be collected, though other types of evidence may still be documented during the medical examination, such as survivor statements, and visible injuries such as bruises, lacerations or bite marks, through visual inspection, photographs and transcription.\\"Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) Program: Frequently Asked Questions\\". Texas Attorney General. Retrieved April 22, 2018. ====Washington, D.C.==== In Washington, D.C., prior to the Violence Against Women Act, which went into effect in 2009, rape kits, despite being standard issue in hospitals, have historically been difficult to obtain, according to an April 2009 report by Washington City Paper. According to the report, rape survivors historically waited up to 12 hours in D.C. emergency rooms while the OB-GYNs present would attend to more immediate emergencies, such as births, after which the invasive exam would be performed by inexperienced residents, who made poor witnesses at trial. The Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) program was established in 2000 at Howard University Hospital in order to address this concerns, after a decade of attempts by Denise Snyder, executive director of the D.C. Rape Crisis Center (DCRCC), to find a major hospital willing to host the program, most of whom either cited economic concerns or declined to respond to her inquiries. After Howard adopted the program, survivors encountered the problem of requiring police authorization before receiving a rape examination, which is attributed by Snyder to the desire to maintain low crime rates on the part of law enforcement agencies, which the Washington Paper depicted as unsympathetic to the plight of the rape survivors profiled in their report. Detective Vincent Spriggs, of D.C.'s Sexual Assault Unit, cites instances of false or unconvincing rape accusations, and requests for rape kits by woman who wish to have pregnancy tests or the morning-after pill administered, as an obstacle to more open use of the kits. In 2008, Howard University canceled the SANE program, after which it reopened under the supervision of the mayor‚Äôs office. ==Depictions in media== The problem of rape kit backlogs was employed as a significant plot point in \\"Behave\\", the September 29, 2010 episode of the television crime drama, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, which depicts the operations of a police sex crimes unit. In the episode, detectives investigate the case of a woman, played by Jennifer Love Hewitt, raped multiple times by the same man over the course of fifteen years, leading them to discover that the perpetrator has raped women all over the United States. The detectives attempt to contact the Special Victims Units in other cities, only to discover that most of them have never tested the majority of their collected rape kits.Hargitay, Mariska (October 13, 2010). \\"Message from Mariska Hargitay: The Shame of Rape-Kit Backlogs\\" Good Housekeeping.Stinchfield, Grant (September 22, 2010).

Located on a site at 401 North Division Street near the city's Kerrytown district, CHS today enrolls approximately 450 students. Established in 1972, CHS was one of the first public magnet schools in the country, offering students a smaller alternative to the city's three large comprehensive high schools. It is one of the few surviving institutions among the wave of experimental high schools that were founded across the United States in the 1970s. Unlike many public alternative schools in other cities, CHS is not restricted to a particular student population (such as \\"gifted\\" or \\"underachieving\\" students), nor does it explicitly emphasize one particular area of study over others. Founded on an experimental \\"school-without-walls\\" concept, CHS continues to offer opportunities to interact with the surrounding community, primarily through its open campus and its Community Resources Program, an avenue for students to design their own courses for credit through experiential learning projects in the Ann Arbor area. In contrast to many traditional high schools, CHS has been known for its small size, its open campus and down to earth student participation in school governance and staff hiring, and loose attendance policies more similar to those of colleges than those at most high schools. The school has also eschewed many of the characteristics of traditional high schools, including interscholastic sports programs, valedictorians, dress codes, detention, hall passes, changing bells, mascots (aside from a rainbow- spangled zebra). ==Early history== By the early 1970s, Ann Arbor had developed a reputation as one of the most liberal campus towns in the country. The city played host to numerous radical political organizations, eventually electing three members of the left-wing Human Rights Party to its city council. Meanwhile, the teenage group Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor was carving out a role as a national pioneer in the nascent youth rights movement,Beatrice Gross and Ronald Gross, eds., The Children's Rights Movement: Overcoming the Oppression of Young People (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Press/Doubleday, 1977), 130. with fifteen-year-old member Sonia Yaco's insurgent school-board candidacy earning her 1,300 write-in votes, or eight percent of the total, in spring 1972.Mike Mosher, \\"Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor: Young, Gifted and Media-Savvy\\" , Bad Subjects, no. 47 (January 2000), accessed 22 February 2008. Reflecting this non-traditional ethos, the city's school district opened two experimental alternative schools during those years: Earthworks (originally Pioneer II) in fall 1971, and Community High School (CHS) in fall 1972. CHS's informal mascot, the rainbow-colored AntiZebra, symbolizes nonconformism and individuality The Community High idea, according to the 1972 blueprint, was to use the city as classroom - thereby creating a \\"school without walls\\" where students could develop their own curricula by drawing on experiences and resource people throughout the community.\\"High School to use city as classroom,\\" Ann Arbor News, 16 August 1972. Although the concept was new to Ann Arbor, planners took inspiration from similar innovative programs then springing up in other cities, including the Chicago High School for Metropolitan Studies (est. 1969), Philadelphia's Parkway High School, and Washington, D.C.'s School Without Walls (est. 1971). Reflecting the liberal educational philosophy of the period, other goals in the early CHS proposals were \\"to provide an opportunity for a heterogeneous group of students and faculty to learn and work together and to combat prejudices based on race, sex, age, lifestyle, and school achievement,\\" and \\"to foster the development of identity and responsibility.\\"\\"How new Community High School will be organized,\\" Ann Arbor News, 2 April 1972. The plan emphasized placing students of all grades in the same classes and programs, and had at its heart the Community Resources Program and the Forum Program, small units of students integrated by age, sex and race which would provide home bases for counseling and cultural-studies work.\\"Community High School plan includes new 'forum' concept,\\" Ann Arbor News, 16 April 1972. For a more recent description of the Forum program, see Larry Abramson, \\"Alternative 'Commie' High Mellows with Time,\\" report on National Public Radio, All Things Considered, 14 February 2008. CHS opened in September 1972, after a $100,000 renovation to an empty downtown building (constructed in 1925) that had formerly housed Jones Elementary School, a majority African-American school which was closed in 1965 due to re-districting for racial-desegregation purposes.\\"Jones building OK'd for new high school,\\" Ann Arbor News, 20 April 1972. Although members of the school board proposed naming classrooms after Ann Arborites who had been killed in the Vietnam War, these plans angered local citizens and teachers who opposed the war, and were never implemented.\\"School room naming debated,\\" Ann Arbor News, 3 August 1972. The school's first dean, Dean Bodley, told the Ann Arbor News that the school's only formal rules would be two safety precautions: \\"no smoking except in the student-teacher lounge and persons must wear shoes\\" - although even these were quickly abandoned. The first commencement, held at the nearby St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, banished caps and gowns, valedictorians and salutorians of traditional graduation ceremonies.Pat Bauer, \\"Commencement to shun tradition,\\" Ann Arbor News, 6 June 1973. See also June Kronholz, \\"Class Issue: At many U.S. schools, the valedictorian is now a tricky question,\\" Wall Street Journal, 17 May 1999, p. A1. The community-based education concept flourished during CHS's first several years, with students developing 569 Community Resource courses in the Ann Arbor community during the fall of 1974 alone.Jody Vellucci, \\"Resource Program results mixed,\\" Ann Arbor News, 28 January 1973; \\"Community High: A First?,\\" Ann Arbor News, 24 October 1974. Within the school itself, unorthodox course offerings included subjects as diverse as dream analysis and Eastern philosophy. A 1974 analysis of the school by University of Michigan researchers noted that \\"[o]verall autonomy in CHS is high,\\" and concluded that \\"CHS is an organization dedicated to the development of humanistic principles... 'Maximum individuality within maximum community' could well be its banner.\\"Linda Banks et al., \\"Agency Study: Community High School,\\" University of Michigan School of Social Work report, 12 December 1974, p. 1, quoted in OECD Programme on Educational Building, Building for School and Community, vol. 3 (Washington, D.C.: OECD Publications Center, 1978), p. 130. Through the 1970s, enrollment remained in the high 300s. Dr. R. Wiley Brownlee, a civil-rights activist and former principal of Willow Run High School in Michigan, became CHS dean in the school's second year. In his time at Willow Run High, Brownlee had taken a conciliatory approach to mounting racial tensions at the school, an approach that eventually cost him his job. His insistence on fair treatment for minority students had also propelled him into national headlines when, in 1971, he was assaulted at gunpoint, then tarred and feathered, by members of the Michigan Ku Klux Klan following a Willow Run school-board meeting.\\"Rights activist Brownlee dies,\\" Lansing State Journal, 14 January 2004. In 1974, shortly after taking the reins at Ann Arbor's Community High, Brownlee characterized the student body as sixty- percent \\"high achievers who are politically disenchanted\\" and forty-percent students who were \\"academically disenchanted.\\"\\"Brownlee, Community High dean,\\" Ann Arbor News, 28 June 1973 In October 1973, the Wall Street Journal described Community High's efforts to overcome what CHS counselor Andrades Smith called \\"widespread and commonly practiced\\" sexism in the hiring of teachers, career counseling of students, and classroom curricula. As the Journal reported, \\"Partly as a result of pressure brought by militant feminists both inside and outside the school system, training seminars for teachers were organized earlier this year to explore subtle and overt sex discrimination at Community High.\\" These consciousness-raising workshops, which included talks by female professionals and \\"role reversals\\" of traditional sex roles, served as model for a program adopted the following year throughout the Ann Arbor school system.Everett Groseclose, \\"Sexism & Schools: Feminists and others now attack sex bias in nation's classrooms,\\" Wall Street Journal, 9 October 1973, p. 1. In 1975, CHS became the first alternative school in Michigan to receive accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Accreditation officials, according to news reports, were mildly taken aback by the school's eccentricities, questioning the lack of any non-smoking area within the school and some students' practice of bringing their pets to school.Mary Jo Frank, \\"Community High accredited despite building,\\" Ann Arbor News, 23 April 1975. ==Merger with Earthworks== Through the mid-1970s, CHS was not the only alternative high school in Ann Arbor. Earthworks High School, a smaller school with an even more experimental culture, had been founded as \\"Pioneer II\\" in 1971. The school was initially an offshoot of Pioneer High School, one of the city's two (at the time) large traditional schools, and it eventually was merged with CHS. Largely student-driven, the 1971 Earthworks proposal declared that students must be equipped \\"to function creatively, contributively, responsibly and happily in a world whose central characteristic is radical change,\\" a task at which traditional institutions were allegedly failing. Students and teachers explained that they sought to depart from \\"the authoritarian model of teaching,\\" where teachers are considered \\"imparters of knowledge\\" who are seldom mistaken.Sharon Woodson, \\"'Free school' stresses 'learning' rather than 'teaching,'\\" Ann Arbor News, 19 September 1971. The school board approved the project despite a rebuke from the board of Ann Arbor's Roman Catholic St. Thomas School (now Gabriel Richard), which called the plan \\"discriminatory by giving support to one group looking for alternatives.\\" Diversity proved one of the main stumbling blocks. Before the program opened, some citizens attacked the school board for not considering minority issues, and in the first year, only five students were of minority background (three African American, and two Asian). Difficulties aside, Earthworks opened in October 1971 with 108 students choosing to attend.\\"Pioneer II starts Monday with 108 students enrolled,\\" Ann Arbor News, 7 October 1971. The school operated in a three-room building at 995 North Maple Road, the former site of Fritz Elementary School, now furnished with rugs and mattresses instead of desks and chairs. Operating under \\"free-school\\" principles, Earthworks students selected their own teachers from among those at the sponsoring Pioneer High School. In addition to three full-time teachers and one administrator, they recruited about a dozen tutors from the University of Michigan, as well as fifty supporting resource people in the community.Sharon Woodson, \\"Pioneer II: a close-up look at what goes on,\\" Ann Arbor News, 17 January 1972. During the first two weeks of operation, students and teachers worked together in a series of meetings and \\"rap sessions\\" to develop a curriculum - one that centered on allowing students to control their own education, work at their own speed, and follow their own interests; and which utilized \\"contracts\\" setting out individual student goals and methods to achieve them.Sharon Woodson, \\"Students plan curriculum in Pioneer II 'Orientation,'\\" Ann Arbor News, 13 October 1971. As the Huron Valley Advisor explained, subjects ranged \\"from geometry, algebra, and American history to Russian literature, organic gardening and parapsychology (witchcraft) - which is taught by a student.\\"\\"New alternatives sought,\\" Huron Valley Advisor, 1 December 1971. Some in the traditional schools derided Earthworks as \\"a hippy kindergarten.\\" But a 1972 Ann Arbor News survey reported that students were pleased with the freedom, power, emphasis on individuality, and ability to control their own educations, although a few disliked the school's unorganized nature and felt that some students failed to thrive with the radical lack of structure.\\"Pioneer II students liked close-knit community,\\" Ann Arbor News, 2 July 1972. By the end of 1977, enrollment at Earthworks was down to fifty students, with two full- time teachers. Feeling that the program would complement that at Community High, the school board merged the two high schools in 1978, despite qualms from many in each program that the Earthworks identity would be lost in the merger, and that CHS would grow too large.Pat Driscoll, \\"Earthworks, Community High merger recommended,\\" Ann Arbor News, 22 June 1977. After its absorption, Earthworks became the name of a separate educational track at CHS,Kathie Hulik, \\"Community High's new approach set,\\" Ann Arbor News, 19 July 1978. and the program continued to run through the late 1990s as a multidisciplinary experiential-learning class emphasizing community activism. ==Community High in the 1980s and 1990s== Rear view from N. Fifth and Detroit streets Through the 1980s, Community High's programs continued on much as they had in the heady days of the 1970s, even as the experimental educational philosophies of the 1970s receded elsewhere in the state and the nation.A school tragedy attracted news coverage in 1980, when four CHS students died in a car wreck on their way to a Forum camping trip in northern Michigan. \\"4 Die in Fiery Wreck,\\" Associated Press, 8 November 1980. During this decade, the school had a much lower profile in Ann Arbor, and it was often stereotyped as a haven for misfits or drug users, with its detractors affixing unflattering nicknames such as \\"Commie High\\" or \\"Community Get-High School.\\" This bad reputation meant that anyone who wanted or needed to be there could do so, and it became a haven, instead, for students with a strong desire to create their own educational direction. It was known as a place with no cliques, and by the seventeenth year of its existence, there had been a grand total of two physical confrontations between students in the school's entire history. During the 1991-92 academic year, CHS temporarily moved to alternate facilities at Stone School in eastern Ann Arbor while its downtown building was renovated and expanded. The year was marred by a series of conflicts that arose between CHS students and students in adult-education programs already located at Stone School, and the alternate location made it difficult to maintain programs that depended on CHS's downtown setting. Still, through the 1980s the school continued to draw a steady stream of enthusiastic applicants dissatisfied with the strictures of the city's traditional high schools.\\"He's dean of a school that's different,\\" Ann Arbor News, 23 April 1989. By 1990, however, CHS had emerged from its status as a quirky, largely unknown alternative, on the road to becoming one of the most desirable and high- profile educational options in the area. In 1989, the school had its first- ever waiting list for students,Jeff Mortimer, \\"Alternative school applicants encounter first-ever waiting list,\\" Ann Arbor News, 15 May 1989. and through the mid- and late 1990s its growing popularity and unorthodox approach once again drew statewide media coverage. CHS also began to attract attention in the municipal political arena, eventually becoming one of the main issues in Ann Arbor's contentious school-board election of June 1994. ===School-board election of 1994=== In 1994, CHS found itself at the center of a bitter and divisive school-board election. Following the 1993 passage of a Michigan state referendum capping local property taxes, money for schools had grown tighter. At the same time, the city's two traditional high schools faced mounting problems with overcrowding. The conservative education group Citizens for Better Education (CBE), which had held a 6-3 majority on the Ann Arbor school board since 1991, favored the city's traditional high schools and a \\"back-to- basics\\" educational approach. With student populations increasing dramatically in size at the traditional high schools, CBE board members questioned both the small size and higher per-pupil spending at CHS. They proposed expanding the school by 100-200 students, and equalizing its per-pupil expenditures with those at the city's larger schools. Proponents of alternative education countered that expanding the student body so drastically would destroy the school's intimate ethos, and that the higher per-pupil spending resulted from CHS offering many classroom places, uncompensated, to students from other high schools who commuted for one or two classes. However, their proposal for a new alternative school to take pressure off the existing high schools was quashed by the board's conservative majority. The June 1994 school-board election thus hinged, in large measure, on the alternative-schools issue. A liberal slate of candidates known as New Challenge took on the three CBE incumbents up for re- election, mobilizing heavy support from Community High parents and students. Two of New Challenge's three candidates--Diane Hockett, Nicholas Roumel, and Ann Lyzenga--were current or recent CHS parents.Patricia Windsor, \\"New slate challenges school board,\\" Ann Arbor News, 29 May 1994; John U. Bacon, \\"The June 13 school vote,\\" Ann Arbor Observer, June 1994. Meanwhile, students at the school formed a political action committee called Ann Arbor Students for Political Action (AASPA) that contributed $1,313 and many hours of volunteer time to New Challenge efforts. The student PAC, according to state officials, was the first in Michigan formed by teenagers to influence a local race, and it garnered regional press coverage in the process.Patricia Windsor, \\"Students form their own PAC,\\" Ann Arbor News, 14 April 1994; L. L. Brasier, \\"In school board race, teens plan to learn clout of PACs,\\" Detroit Free Press, 18 April 1994. Though AASPA began as a class project at CHS, it grew to include 150 high school students, representing all three public Ann Arbor high schools of the time.Fiona Rose, \\"A2 High School Pac Takes On School Board Elections,\\" Agenda, May 1994. CBE incumbents criticized the CHS student group - one decrying it in the Detroit Free Press as \\"narrow-minded, with a narrow focus,\\" another claiming that \\"Community High is not going to be the moving force in this town.\\"L. L. Brasier, \\"In school board race, teens plan to learn clout of PACs,\\" Detroit Free Press, 18 April 1994. The race was one of the most heated and expensive in the city's history, with the two slates running cable TV ads (a first for Ann Arbor school elections); the New Challenge ad was produced by another CHS parent volunteer, film/video professional Dave Anderson. The two opposing campaigns spent a combined $32,000, more than in any previous campaign.Patricia Windsor, \\"School board campaign funds hit new high,\\" Ann Arbor News, 14 July 1994. In the end, New Challenge swept to victory, defeating all three CBE incumbents and assuring the continuance of Community High School in its existing format.Patricia Windsor, \\"New Challenge sweeps onto school board,\\" Ann Arbor News, 14 June 1994; Patricia Windsor, \\"Progressives taking over,\\" Ann Arbor News, 4 July 1994. The new, more liberal school-board majority soon revived plans to establish another alternative school, known simply as \\"The New School,\\" although that project was curtailed in 2000 after four difficult years of operation.\\"School board should support New School,\\" Michigan Daily, 14 May 1997. ===Enrollment battles=== From 1989 to the present, CHS has attracted far more applicant students than it can accommodate.Ann Schimke, \\"Still doing their 'thing,'\\" Ann Arbor News, 23 June 2002. The process for choosing which students may attend, determined by the school board, eventually reached farcical levels. A lottery was used in 1992, but in March 1993 a first-come/first-served method produced a twenty-four-hour line-up on the school's front lawn. In 1995, the line formed three days ahead of time; in 1996, the method produced a two-week line-up outside the school district's administration building,Will Weissert, \\"Ann Arbor students line up for high school,\\" Michigan Daily, 19 March 1996. complete with mobile homes, portable toilets, roving television news crews, and sardonic editorial cartoons in the local press. In May 1991, the school board had agreed that black students on the waiting list would receive priority, in order to boost CHS's relatively low numbers of African Americans. But many CHS students charged that the first-come/first-served admissions method of the mid-1990s was producing a less diverse student body, one composed of teenagers whose parents (or, in several cases, parents' secretaries) could afford to take many days off from work to hold down positions in line. The return to the lottery procedure in 1997, however, eliminated the frantic annual queuing ritual. By the early 2000s the number of applications was still growing each year, with approximately three students applying for each of the 108 slots for incoming freshmen. It should also be noted that Ann Arbor high school students who are not accepted into Community High School by way of raffle may still attend the school part-time as a dual enrolled student. Dual enrolled students are primarily enrolled in classes at one of Pioneer, Huron, or Skyline High School, but school bus shuttles commute these students back and forth from Community High School at various times during the school day. As such, most students who dual enroll take 2 or 3 courses at Community High School, and the rest at their primary high school. Despite the enrollment-procedure changes, the school remains less racially diverse than the city's two large traditional schools. Approximately 15.2 percent of the CHS student body came from racial- minority backgrounds as of 2005, compared with 29.1 at Pioneer High and 40.8 percent at Huron High, making CHS, as former Dean Peter Ways wrote in 2007, \\"one of the least diverse schools in Ann Arbor.\\"Peter Ways, letter to CHS parents and guardians (PDF), 5 October 2007. Over the past decade, a number of local critics have argued that the high number of applications for CHS student slots suggested serious weaknesses at the city's traditional high schools. But, to the extent that applicants are motivated by overcrowding at the city's other schools, the problem was expected to be ameliorated following the opening of Skyline High School, a third traditional school, in 2008. The class of 2009 had the second-highest ACT scores in the state of Michigan.David Jesse, \\"Students at status quo in MME test,\\" Ann Arbor News, 8 August 2008.

He married the former Carmen Davis, and they had six children. Cervantes' political career began in 1949 when he was elected to the St. Louis Board of Aldermen representing the 15th Ward. He was re-elected to that position in 1953 and 1957. In 1955 he was unsuccessful in a citywide bid for President of the Board of Aldermen. He was elected to that post in 1959, but was defeated in a bid for re-election in 1963. == Term as mayor == In 1965, Cervantes challenged incumbent Mayor Raymond Tucker, who was seeking an unprecedented fourth term in office. He defeated Tucker by a vote of 83,698 to 68,379. A third candidate, John Noel, received 1,087 votes. Mr. Cervantes won election as Mayor in the April 6, 1965 City election, over Republican Maurice R. Zumwalt, by a vote of 102,961 to 47,510. During his term as mayor, Cervantes focused in particular on the issues of race relations, crime- fighting, and city finance. While many other large cities suffered through race riots during the late 1960s, the peace was kept in St. Louis. Mayor Cenvantes met with and talked at length with African-American leaders and included African-Americans in City government positions and city commissions. During Cervantes' term a Commission on Crime and Law Enforcement was created, although Life Magazine accused Cervantes and the head of the Commission, lawyer Morris Shenker, of strong ties to organized crime.Life Magazine, May 29, 1970, pages 24-31 Voters passed a one per cent sales tax to put policemen on horseback in city parks. Car thefts were reduced by his 'lock it and pocket the key' program. Mayor Cervantes was successful in getting a $2,000,000 bond issue passed for completion of the Gateway Arch and grounds. This was necessary to get $6,000,000 in Federal aid. A $15,000,000 bond issue for street lighting and a juvenile center was passed in 1972. Other successes during his two terms included establishment of Night Housing Court, organization of a Business Development Commission to help keep businesses in the City and bring in new ones along with setting up the Area Office of Aging, Beautification Commission, and Citizens Service Bureau to handle complaints. The Land Reutilization Authority was created to take over vacant properties and group them for re-use. Mayor Cervantes failed in his attempt to get a new airport started in Illinois, close to downtown St. Louis. He thought this would be a great benefit to the City and downtown St. Louis, but the proposal generated great controversy and helped lead to his defeat for a third term in 1973. Cervantes was defeated in that bid by John Poelker in the Democratic primary. Cervantes was defeated in another bid for mayor in 1977 by James F. Conway. Another Cervantes failure was allowing the demolition of Pruitt Igoe, which left thousands of residents homeless. == Later life == After serving as mayor, Cervantes taught at St. Louis University and returned as an active manager of his business interests that included Cervantes and Associates Insurance Agency and the Laclede Cab Company. After losing office, Cervantes published a memoir entitled \\"Mr. Mayor\\" (Los Angeles: Nash Publishing, 1974). Cervantes died in St. Louis on June 23, 1983, at age 62. He was buried in Calvary Cemetery.

In addition, the green is replaced by a \\"yard\\", and a player whose ball lies in the yard has the right to turn the goal net so as to face them. According to Silver, the oval ball is designed so as to give the player more control over where the ball travels. Burton Silver explains: Because the oval ball spins on two axes, it is almost impossible to hook or slice it. However, controlled hooks and slices are easily achieved by angling the ball on the specially designed tee adaptor. Back-spinning the ball and running it on is also achievable by the way in which the ball is set up on the tee. According to NZ player Greg Turner, GolfCross is a more strategic and tactical game than regular golf, especially in match play, and because players are shooting for goal it tends to be more dramatic and exciting to play and watch. GolfCross can bring back many advantages to normal golf. The mindset that the ball will hardly ever slice or hook can be bought back to golf and used effectively. There are GolfCross courses in Germany, Argentina, England, Ireland, Scotland and New Zealand. It is still unclear how widely GolfCross is played. Recent interest has centered on its ecological advantages. Because it doesn't use putting greens, agricultural chemicals can be done away with, and because the ball is easy for any player to back spin, fairways don't require irrigating to keep them soft in order to reduce run-on. ==References== ==External links== *Official site *BBC article on the sport Category:Individual sports Category:Forms of golf ","title":"GolfCross"},{"id":"1268882","text":"Thomas Joseph Odhiambo Mboya (15August 19305July 1969) was a Kenyan trade unionist, educator, Pan-Africanist, author, independence activist, and statesman who was one of the founding fathers of the Republic of Kenya.Kenya Human Rights Commission, \\"An evening with Tom Mboya\\" He spearheaded the negotiations for independence at the Lancaster House ConferencesDavid Goldsworthy, Tom Mboya The Man Kenya wanted to Forget, Heinnemann, 1982 at Page 191 to 195, and was instrumental in the formation of Kenya's independence party, the Kenya African National Union (KANU), where he served as its first Secretary-General.Bethwell A. Ogot, William Ochieng, Decolonization and Independence in Kenya: 1940 ‚Äì 1963, East African Publishers, 1995, Page 65 He laid the foundation for Kenya's capitalist and mixed economy policies at the height of the Cold War and set up several of the country's key labour institutions. Mboya's intelligence, charm, leadership and oratory skills won him admiration from all over the world. He gave speeches, debates, and interviews across the world in favor of Kenya‚Äôs independence from British colonial rule and spoke at several rallies in the goodwill of the civil rights movement in the United States. In 1958, at the age of 28, Mboya was elected Conference Chairman at the All-African Peoples' Conference convened by Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana. He helped build the Trade Union Movement in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania and across Africa. At one time, he served as the Africa Representative to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). In May 1959, Mboya called a conference in Lagos, Nigeria to form the first All-Africa ICFTU labour organization. Mboya worked with John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. to create educational opportunities for African students; this effort resulted in the Kennedy Airlifts of the 1960s, which enabled East African students to study at American colleges. Notable beneficiaries of this airlift include Wangari Maathai, who later won the Nobel Peace Prize, and Barack Obama Sr., the father and namesake of Barack Obama. In 1960, Mboya was the first Kenyan to be featured on the front page cover of Time magazine, in a painting by Bernard Safran. ==Early life and education== Thomas Joseph Odhiambo Mboya a.k.a \\"Tom Mboya\\" was born on August 15, 1930, in Kilima Mbogo in the then British Kenya Colony, to Leonardus Ndiege and Marcella Awour, who were low-income sisal farmers. He studied at Kabaa Catholic school and St. Mary's school, Yala for his A-levels. He later wrote his Cambridge School Certificate in 1946 at Holy Ghost College (later Mangu High School). He attended Royal Sanitary Institute's Medical Training School for Sanitary Inspectors at Nairobi, qualifying as an inspector in 1950. He later enrolled in a certificate course in economics with Efficiency Correspondence College of South Africa. In 1955, he won a one year course in Industrial Management at England's Ruskin College, University of Oxford. ==Career and politics== Mboya started working for the city of Nairobi and became involved with the trade union. While still working as a trade union official, Tom Mboya enrolled for a Matriculation Exemption Certificate with the Efficiency Correspondence College of South Africa, majoring in Economics. In 1955, he went to Ruskin College, University of Oxford to study Industrial Management.David Goldsworthy, Tom Mboya The Man Kenya wanted to Forget, Heinnemann, 1982 at Page 34 While employed by the Nairobi City Council as a sanitary inspector, Mboya was elected as chairman of the African Staff Association. He developed it into a trade union, which became known as The Kenya Local Government Workers Union. When the colonial government refused to recognize the union, Mboya sued for recognition and won. In 1953, during the Mau Mau War for Independence, Jomo Kenyatta and other leaders of the independence party, Kenya African Union (KAU), were arrested. They asked Mboya to take up leadership of the KAU and continue the struggle. However, the government banned the KAU. Mboya then turned to using the trade unions as a platform to fight for independence. He was elected as Secretary General of the Kenya Federation of Labour (KFL), the umbrella body for trade unions in Kenya. In that role, Mboya gave speeches in London and Washington against British atrocities in Kenya. He also organized several strikes seeking better working conditions for African workers. At that point, the colonial government nearly closed down the labour movement in the effort to suppress his activities. Mboya reached out to other labour leaders across the world, more so in the ICFTU, including American A. Philip Randolph, with whom he was close. Mboya raised funds to build a headquarters for the KFL. In 1956, after Mboya had returned from the United Kingdom, the colonial government allowed black Africans to run for office and serve in the Legislative Assembly. Tom Mboya was elected from Nairobi.Bethwell A. Ogot, William Ochieng, Decolonization and Independence in Kenya: 1940 ‚Äì 1963, East African Publishers, 1995, Page 58 He was elected secretary of the African Caucus (called African Elected Members Organization - AEMO) and continued a campaign for independence, as well as seeking freedom for Jomo Kenyatta and other political prisoners. He used his incredible diplomacy skills to get support for the independence movement from foreign countries. In 1961, Jomo Kenyatta was released and together with Oginga Odinga and Mboya, they formed the Kenya African National Union. It negotiated with the United Kingdom and colonial government to set conditions for Kenya's independence in 1964. Mboya was instrumental in the talks. He also designed the flag for the new republic. ==Kenya gains independence== In the Independent Republic of Kenya, Mboya who was a pre-independence Minister of Labor since 1962, was appointed by the New Prime Minister Jomo Kenyatta as the first Cabinet Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs- a post he held from June 1, 1963 until December 1964. He created the National Social Security Fund, Kenya‚Äôs social security scheme. He also established an Industrial Court to hear labor-management cases. When Kenya became a republic on December 12, 1964, the new President Kenyatta appointed Tom Mboya to the Economic Planning and Development Ministry and transferred all functions of his former ministry to the office of Attorney General under Charles Mugane Njonjo. whilst some pseudo sources have claimed that, \\"Together with Finance Minister Mwai Kibaki, he issued Sessional Paper 10, which defined Kenya‚Äôs form of economic policies.\\" The truth is that James Samuel Gichuru was the Minister for Finance from June 1, 1963 until 1966 when Kibaki was a parliamentary secretary (assistant minister) in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry with Julius Gikonyo Kiano PhD as the Cabinet Minister. Tom issued the Sessional Paper No. 10 in April 1965 covering the period of 1964 - 1970 under the title African Socialism and its Application to Planning in Kenya. Kenyatta and Mboya were known advocates of Non A-lined international policy not wanting blanket application of capitalism while completely abhorring scientific socialism. For avoidance of doubt, it was until 1966 when Kibaki was appointed for the first time as Minister for Commerce and Industry. Mboya's development plans at the Ministry were credited for Kenya's development rate of 7%, which was sustained during his tenure as the Planning Minister. ==Marriage and family== He married Pamela Mboya (n√©e Odede) in 1960 at St. Peters Clavers Church, Nairobi.David Goldsworthy, Tom Mboya The Man Kenya wanted to Forget, Heinnemann, 1982 at Page 191 They had five children: Maureen Odero; Nairobi First Lady Dr. Susan Mboya; Luke Mboya; Peter Mboya; Patrick Mboya(who died aged four). After Tom Mboya's death, his widow Pamela Mboya had another son with her brother-in-law, in accordance to Luo tradition, whom she named Tom Mboya, Jr. in his honor. She was appointed as an ambassador. He had another daughter by the name [Alakie Mboya] -a thespian. ==Death and memorials== Mboya was fatally shot by Nahashon Njoroge in 1969 on Government Road (now Moi Avenue) as he was leaving a chemist, but it was reported in Nairobi that Njoroge had died at 3am on 8 November. According to these reports, he went to his death without explaining what he had meant when he asked police after his arrest: \\"Why don‚Äôt you go after the big man?\\" It was due to such statements which suspicions arose that Mboya's shooting was a political assassination. Outrage and despair over his assassination led to riots in the major cities of Kenya. Mboya was buried in an emotional ceremony at his Rusinga Island ancestral home. President Jomo Kenyatta gave a eulogy at Mboya‚Äôs requiem mass, saying of his colleague, \\"Kenya's independence would have been seriously compromised were it not for the courage and steadfastness of Tom Mboya.\\" A statue of Mboya was installed on Moi Avenue, where he was killed, and the nearby busy Victoria Street was renamed Tom Mboya Street in his honour. ==Biography== A monument in honor of Tom Mboya erected at Moi Avenue, Nairobi Thomas Odhiambo Mboya was born on 15 August 1930 in Kilima Mbogo, near Thika town in what was called the White Highlands of Kenya. ===Education=== Mboya was educated at various Catholic mission schools. In 1942, he joined a Catholic Secondary School in Yala, in Nyanza province, St. Mary's School Yala. In 1946, he went to the Holy Ghost College (later Mang'u High School), where he passed well enough to proceed to do his Cambridge School Certificate. In 1948, Mboya joined the Royal Sanitary Institute's Medical Training School for Sanitary Inspectors at Nairobi, qualifying as an inspector in 1950. In 1955, he received a scholarship from Britain's Trades Union Congress to attend Ruskin College, University of Oxford, where he studied industrial management. Upon his graduation in 1956, he returned to Kenya and joined politics at a time when the British government was gaining control over the Kenya Land Freedom Army Mau Mau uprising. ===Political life=== Mboya's political life started immediately after he was employed at Nairobi City Council as a sanitary inspector in 1950. A year after joining African Staff Association, he was elected as its president and immediately embarked at molding the association into a trade union named the Kenya Local Government Workers' Union. This made his employer suspicious, but before they could sack him, he resigned. However, he was able to continue working for the Kenya Labour Workers Union as secretary-general before embarking on his studies in Britain. Upon returning from Britain, he contested and won a seat against incumbent C.M.G. Argwings-Kodhek. In 1957, he became dissatisfied with the low number of African leaders (only eight out of fifty at the time) in the Legislative council and decided to form his own party, the People's Congress Party. At that time, Mboya developed a close relationship with Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana who, like Mboya, was a Pan-Africanist. In 1958, during the All-African Peoples' Conference in Ghana, convened by Kwame Nkurumah, Mboya was elected as the Conference Chairman at the age of 28. In 1959, together with the African-American Students Foundation in the United States, Mboya organized the Airlift Africa project, through which 81 Kenyan students were flown to the U.S. to study at U.S. universities. Barack Obama's father, Barack Obama, Sr., was a friend of Mboya's and a fellow Luo; he received a scholarship through the AASF and occasional grants for books and expenses, although he was not on the first airlift plane in 1959, since he was headed for Hawaii, not the continental U.S.. In 1960, the Kennedy Foundation agreed to underwrite the airlift, after Mboya visited Senator Jack Kennedy to ask for assistance, and Airlift Africa was extended to Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar (now Tanzania), Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and Nyasaland (now Malawi). Some 230 African students received scholarships to study at Class I accredited colleges in the United States in 1960, and hundreds more in 1961‚Äì63. In 1960, Mboya's People's Congress Party joined with Kenya African Union and Kenya Independence Movement to form the Kenya African National Union (KANU) in an attempt to form a party that would both transcend tribal politics and prepare for participation in the Lancaster House Conference (held at Lancaster House in London) where Kenya's constitutional framework and independence were to be negotiated. As Secretary General of KANU, Mboya headed the Kenyan delegation. After Kenya's independence on 1 June 1963, Mboya was elected as an MP for Nairobi Central Constituency (today: Kamukunji Constituency)Center for Multiparty Democracy: Politics and Paliamenterians in Kenya 1944‚Äì2007 and became Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, and later Minister for Economic Planning and Development. In this role, he wrote the important \\"Sessional Paper 10\\" on Harambee and the Principles of African Socialism (adopted by Parliament in 1964), which provided a model of government based on African values. ===Assassination=== He retained the portfolio as Minister for Economic Planning and Development until his death at age 38 when he was gunned down on 5 July 1969 on Government Road (now Moi Avenue), Nairobi CBD after visiting Chaani's Pharmacy. Nahashon Isaac Njenga Njoroge was convicted for the murder and later hanged. After his arrest, Njoroge asked: \\"Why don't you go after the big man?\\" Who he meant by \\"the big man\\" was the late President Jomo Kenyatta and his Kiambu Mafia since Mboya was seen as a possible contender for the presidency. The mostly tribal elite around Kenyatta has been blamed for his death, which has never been subject of a judicial inquiry. Others blame supporters of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga who feared that Mboya was attracting too much support from members of the Luo tribe away from him. During Mboya's burial, a mass demonstration against the attendance of President Jomo Kenyatta led to a big skirmish, with two people shot dead. The demonstrators believed that Kenyatta was involved in the death of Mboya, thus eliminating him as a threat to his political career, although this remains a disputed matter. Mboya left a wife and five children. He is buried in a mausoleum on Rusinga Island which was built in 1970.Joe Ombour, \\"Tombs where great men lie\\", Daily Nation, Weekend Magazine, 5 September 2003 A street in Nairobi is named after him. Mboya's role in Kenya's politics and transformation is the subject of increasing interest, especially with the prominence of American politician Barack Obama. Obama's father, Barack Obama, Sr., was a US-educated Kenyan who benefited from Mboya's scholarship programme in the 1960s, and married during his stay there, siring the future Illinois Senator and President. Obama Sr. had seen Mboya shortly before the assassination, and testified at the ensuing trial. Obama Sr. believed he was later targeted in a hit-and-run incident as a result of this testimony.\\"A father's charm, absence\\", Boston Globe 21 September 2008 ==Personal life== Mboya's father Leonard Ndiege was an overseer at a sisal plantation in Kilima Mbogo. Mboya married Pamela Mboya in 1962 (a daughter of the politician Walter Odede). They had five children. Their daughters are Maureen Odero, a high court judge in Mombasa, and Susan Mboya, a Coca-Cola executive, who continues the education airlift program initiated by Tom Mboya, and is married to former Nairobi governor Evans Kidero. Their sons included Lucas Mboya, and twin brothers Peter (died in a 2004 motorcycle accident) and Patrick (died aged four). After Tom's death, Pamela had one child, Tom Mboya Jr., with Alphonse Okuku, the brother of Tom Mboya. Pamela died of an illness in January 2009 while seeking treatment in South Africa. ==References== ==External links== *Biographical Entry at BlackPast.org * * Lumumba information ‚Äî that could have parted him with Odinga. * Includes Background Memorandum prepared by Senator Kennedy's Office, August 1960. * * * Category:1930 births Category:1969 deaths Category:Kenyan Luo people Category:Assassinated Kenyan politicians Category:Deaths by firearm in Kenya Category: Kenyan trade unionists Category:Academics of Ruskin College Category:People murdered in Kenya Category:Government ministers of Kenya Category:Kenya African National Union politicians Category:Alumni of Mang'u High School Category:Alumni of St. Mary's School Yala Category:Kenyan murder victims Category:City councillors Category:Local political office-holders in Kenya Category:People from Central Province (Kenya) Category:Members of the Legislative Council of Kenya Category:Kenyan Luo politicians ","title":"Tom Mboya"},{"id":"1268884","text":"The cluster of rocks that is Barrett Reef (often known as Barrett's Reef) is one of the most hazardous reefs in New Zealand.

Due to the channelling effect of Cook Strait, which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the Tasman Sea, the currents are strong and fickle and gales are common. Add to this the volume of traffic which uses the channel (including several crossings daily of the inter-island ferries to Picton), and it is not surprising that the reef has a lengthy roll-call of shipwrecks. ===History of vessels damaged, stranded, or wrecked on Barrett Reef=== * 1848 Sobraon, barque, bound for Sydney on Barrett's Reef.

The story focuses on the eponymous protagonist, a Japanese high-school girl who finds herself pulled into various worlds populated by women who consider her appealing. Miyuki-chan in Wonderland appeared as a serial in the manga magazine Newtype from 1993 to 1995, based on the 1865 children's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. Kadokawa Shoten collected the seven chapters into one bound volume and published it in September 1995. While the concept of Miyuki-chan in Wonderland was initially imagined as the first chapter by writer Ohkawa, the team continued with it for the enjoyment it provided. An image album and an original video animation adaptation of the first two chapters were published in 1995. In 2002, Tokyopop announced that it had licensed Miyuki-chan in Wonderland for an English-language translation, and published it in October 2003. It is now out of print. It received a range of critical reaction from reviewers, from praise as cute entertainment to criticism as the worst of Clamp's works. The eponymous protagonist has made cameo appearances in other works by Clamp: the music video Clamp in Wonderland (1994) Clamp School Detectives (1997), and the fantasy manga series Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle (2003‚Äì2009). Viz Media acquired the rights to the manga and digitally published it on September 24, 2014. ==Plot== Miyuki-chan in Wonderland consists of seven, independent chapters linked together by the eponymous protagonist. *: While rushing to high school, Miyuki sees a skateboarding playboy bunny, and falls down a rabbit hole. There she meets various women who find her attractive, and panicking, awakens from her dream. However, as she runs to school, the woman skateboards past her again. *: While combing her hair in front of a mirror, Miyuki finds herself kissed by her reflection and pulled into the mirror, where she meets women who find her attractive. Fleeing from them, she eventually returns to her bedroom. *: Miyuki awakens to find that she has overslept and missed the television broadcast of the film Barbarella (1968). She is then pulled into the television by a pair of legs. Fleeing from the women who consider her attractive, Miyuki wakes up to see a pair of legs emerging from the television. *: Rushing to her part-time work at a diner, Miyuki finds a boxing ring, in which she is pitted against other restaurant's employees. She attempts to escape, only to be caught and blasted. She awakens, having bumped her head on the staff room door, and enters to find the boxing ring. *: Miyuki reads a comic about mah-jongg, when three mah-jongg players appear to play strip mah-jongg with her. One reveals herself to be \\"Mah-Jongg Girl\\", a superheroine, and with her defeat, Miyuki takes her place. She eventually awakens. *: After failing to complete a video game, Miyuki accepts the video game's offer to take over as the heroine and is transported inside the game, where she meets women who find her attractive. Miyuki, however, dies inside the game, and the same game menu appears. *: While watching X in the film theater, Miyuki is swooped into the film, where its characters find her attractive. She awakens in the theater to find that she has now replaced its protagonist, to her shock. ==Development== Miyuki-chan in Wonderland was developed by Clamp‚Äîthe all-female, manga artist team consisting of Satsuki Igarashi, Mokona, Tsubaki Nekoi, and Nanase Ohkawa. Ohkawa conceived the concept of Miyuki-chan in Wonderland, which was supposed to serve as the first chapter. The team, however, decided to continue with the concept, as Ohkawa was fond of it and Mokona enjoyed illustrating the characters. The protagonist was illustrated with her school uniform, as that provided the team with more fan service opportunities during action scenes. In retrospective, the team felt that the manga acted as a showcase for Mokona's \\"sexy, female character designs\\", writing: \\"It was fun, but a little hentai.\\" ==Media== ===Manga=== Written and illustrated by Clamp, the seven chapters of Miyuki-chan in Wonderland appeared as a serial in the manga magazine Newtype from 1993 to 1995. Kadokawa Shoten published the chapters in one bound volume on September 10, 1995, and re-released it on May 1, 2001. Tokyopop licensed Miyuki-chan in Wonderland for an English-language release in North America, and published it on October 5, 2003. It has since gone out of print. The manga has also been translated into other languages, such as Italian by Planet Manga, and German by Carlsen Verlag. ===OVA=== Directed by Seiko Sayama and Mamoru Hamazu, the original video animation (OVA) adaptation of the first two chapters of Miyuki-chan in Wonderland was released by Sony Music Entertainment on June 21, 1995. It was produced by Animate Film, with Toshiyuki Honda as the composer and Tetsuro Aoki as the designer. Ohkawa wrote the script for the adaptation. ADV Films licensed Miyuki-chan in Wonderland for a Region 1 release, and published it in May 2002. ===Other=== An image album based on Miyuki-chan in Wonderland was released on April 1, 1995, by Sony Music Entertainment. ==Reception and legacy== Miyuki-chan in Wonderland received a range of critical reaction. In Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy (2009), Eden Lee Lackner wrote that the manga's notability stems from \\"how it plays with textual boundaries\\"; for example, Miyuki travels through Clamp's adaptation of the fictional worlds of Alice in Wonderland and X. According to her, Miyuki's travels to X land serves as \\"characteristic\\" of Clamp's intersection of its characters and narratives from its different works. Dani Cavallaro in Clamp in Context (2012) stated that Miyuki-chan in Wonderlands \\"most memorable\\" aspect comes from the sense of artistic \\"creative enjoyment\\". Writing for Sequential Tart, Sheena McNeil greatly enjoyed the manga, praising it as entertaining \\"fluff\\". Patrick King of Animefringe wrote that the illustrations contributed the most appeal to the plotless manga, with the inclusion of a bonus section and colored OVA concept-art pages praised as well. In contrast, Katherine Dacey, the former senior manga editor for PopCultureShock, described the manga as \\"the nadir of this talented quartet‚Äôs work\\" in her list of the ten worst manga. According to her, the \\"inane\\" short stories served as \\"just a pretext for CLAMP to draw scantily-clad beauties engaging in vaguely naughty behavior (usually making a pass at the vaguely horrified Miyuki or inviting her to play strip poker).\\" Mason Templar, writing in Manga: The Complete Guide (2007), similarly reviewed the manga, commenting that it was best viewed as an artbook. Erica Friedman, the founder of Yuricon, a lesbian-themed convention, and ALC Publishing, wrote that the settings were \\"loosely based on Lewis Carroll‚Äôs iconic works, games and Clamp‚Äôs own work.\\" According to her, the manga lacked emotion and a true depiction of lesbians, only showing \\"fictitious female beings groping a fictitious female character\\". The anime adaptation also received a range of reviews. Anime News Network's Christopher Macdonald recommended it as nonsensical entertainment, describing it as Clamp's tribute to Alice in Wonderland and its sequel Through the Looking Glass (1871). McNeil praised it as nicely animated entertainment, though it lacked developed characters and a plot. In his review of the anime adaptation, King concluded: \\"It's simply a showcase of some cute and sexy animation designed by CLAMP, no more, no less.\\" He noted the absence of an English-language dub. Chris Beveridge of Mania Entertainment praised the character designs and voice acting, rating the anime C-. Another reviewer for Sequential Tart expressed her lukewarm feelings towards the anime, and wrote that it might appeal to fans of Clamp or art films. While praising the visuals and audio as helping to create a surreal atmosphere, Raphael See of THEM Anime Reviews, in contrast, wrote that the effect was ruined by the sexual nature of the plot; he recommended Dreams (1990) or Robot Carnival (1987) instead. In The Anime Encyclopedia : A Guide to Japanese Animation since 1917 (2001), Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy unfavorably reviewed the anime, describing it as \\"pointlessly kinky.\\" Miyuki has appeared in other works by Clamp. She appears in the video collection Clamp in Wonderland (1994), and makes a cameo appearance in the backgrounds of the fantasy manga series Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle (2003‚Äì2009). == References == ===General references=== * ===Inline citations=== ==External links== *Digital edition of Miyuki-chan in Wonderland at Viz Media's official website *Miyuki-chan in Wonderland at Clamp's official website via Internet Archive * * Category:1993 manga Category:1995 anime OVAs Category:ADV Films Category:Anime based on Alice in Wonderland Category:Comedy anime and manga Category:LGBT in anime and manga Category:Fantasy anime and manga Category:Seinen manga Category:Sex comedy anime and manga Category:Tokyopop titles Category:Yuri (genre) anime and manga Category:Viz Media manga Category:Works by Clamp (manga artists) ","title":"Miyuki-chan in Wonderland"},{"id":"1268900","text":"Theydon Bois is a London Underground station in the village of Theydon Bois in Essex, England.

The language originally diverged from the Medieval Greek of the Byzantine Empire following the Seljuq Turk victory at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. As a result of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in the 1920s, all Cappadocian Greeks were forced to emigrate to Greece where they were resettled in various locations, primarily to Central and Northern Greece. The Cappadocians rapidly shifted to Standard Modern Greek and their language was thought to be extinct since the 1960s. In June 2005, Mark Janse (Ghent University) and Dimitris Papazachariou (University of Patras) discovered Cappadocians in Central and Northern Greece who could still speak their ancestral language fluently. Many are middle-aged, third-generation speakers who take a very positive attitude towards the language, as opposed to their parents and grandparents. The latter are much less inclined to speak Cappadocian and more often than not switch to Standard Modern Greek. ==History and research== Demotic in yellow. Pontic in orange.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. https://archive.org/details/moderngreekinas00hallgoog Original Cappadocian homeland By the fifth century AD, the last of the Indo-European native languages of Asia Minor ceased to be spoken, replaced by Koine Greek. At the same time, the communities of central Asia Minor were becoming actively involved in the affairs of the Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire, and some (now Greek-speaking) Cappadocians, such as Maurice Tiberius (r. 582‚Äì602) and Heraclius (r. 610 to 641), would even rise to become emperors. Cappadocian Greek first began to diverge from the Medieval Greek common language of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire six centuries later, following the Byzantine's defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. This defeat allowed Turkish speakers to enter Asia Minor for the first time, severing Cappadocia from the rest of the Byzantine world.Speros Vryonis The Decline of Medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor, 1971, p. 482 By the 20th century Cappadocian Greek would come to be heavily influenced by Turkish, but unlike Standard Modern Greek, it would not be influenced by Venetian and French from the Frankokratia period, which followed the Fourth Crusade's sack of Constantinople in 1204. The earliest records of the language are in the macaronic poems of Jalal ad- Din Muhammad Rumi (1207‚Äì1273), who lived in Iconium (Konya), and some ghazals by his son Sultan Walad. Interpretation of the Greek language texts is difficult as they are written in Arabic script, and in Rumi's case without vowel points; Dedes' edition (ŒîŒ≠Œ¥ŒµœÇ) is the most recent edition.ŒîŒ≠Œ¥ŒµœÇ, Œî. 1993.

By the early 20th century many Cappadocians had shifted to Turkish altogether (written with the Greek alphabet, Karamanlidika). Where Greek was maintained (numerous villages near Kayseri, including Misthi, Malakopea, Prokopion, Karvali, and Anakou), it became heavily influenced by the surrounding Turkish. However, there are next to no written documents in Medieval or early Modern Cappadocian, as the language was, and still essentially is, a spoken language only. Those educated to read and write, such as priests, would do so in the more classicising literary Greek. The earliest outside studies of spoken Cappadocian date from the 19th century, but are generally not very accurate. One of the first documented studies was Modern Greek in Asia Minor: A study of dialect of Silly, Cappadocia and Pharasa (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1916), by Richard MacGillivray Dawkins (1871‚Äì1955), the first Bywater and Sotheby Professor of Byzantine and Modern Greek Language and Literature at the University of Oxford, based on fieldwork conducted by the author in Cappadocia in 1909‚Äì1911. After the population exchange, several Cappadocian dialects have been described by collaborators of the Center for Asia Minor Studies (ŒöŒ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒøŒΩ ŒúŒπŒ∫œÅŒ±œÉŒπŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫œéŒΩ Œ£œÄŒøœÖŒ¥œéŒΩ) in Athens: Uluaƒüa√ß (I.I. Kesisoglou, 1951), Aravan (D. Phosteris & I.I. Kesisoglou, 1960), Axo (G. Mavrochalyvidis & I.I. Kesisoglou, 1960) and Anaku (A.P. Costakis, 1964), resulting in a series of grammars (although regrettably not all Cappadocian villages were covered). In recent years, the study of Cappadocian has seen a revival following the pioneering work on Language Contact, Creolization, and Genetic Linguistics (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988) by Sarah Grey Thomason and Terrence Kaufman, and a series of publications on various aspects of Cappadocian linguistics by Mark Janse, professor at Roosevelt Academy, who has also contributed a grammatical survey of Cappadocian to a forthcoming handbook on Modern Greek dialects edited by Christos Tzitzilis (Aristotle University of Thessaloniki). The recent discovery of Cappadocian speakers by Janse and Papazachariou will result in the release of a new dictionary and a compilation of texts. Cappadocian Greek is well known from the linguistic literature as being one of the first well documented cases of language death, and in particular the significant admixture of non-Indo-European linguistic features into an Indo-European language. This process was pronounced in southwestern Cappadocia, and included the introduction of vowel harmony and verb-final word order. ==Characteristics== The Greek element in Cappadocian is to a large extent Byzantine, e.g. Œ∏√≠r or t√≠r 'door' from (Ancient and) Byzantine Greek Œ∏œçœÅŒ± (Modern Greek Œ∏œçœÅŒ±), p√≠ka or √©pka 'I did' from Byzantine Greek Œ≠œÄŒøŒπŒ∫Œ± (Modern Greek Œ≠Œ∫Œ±ŒΩŒ±). Other, pre-Byzantine, archaisms are the use of the possessive adjectives m√≥(n), s√≥(n) etc. from Ancient Greek ·ºêŒºœåœÇ, œÉœåœÇ, etc. and the formation of the imperfect by means of the suffix -i≈°k- from the Ancient Greek (Ionic) iterative suffix -(e)sk-. Turkish influence appears at every level. The Cappadocian sound system includes the Turkish vowels ƒ±, √∂, √º, and the Turkish consonants b, d, g, ≈°, ≈æ, t≈°, d≈æ (although some of these are also found in Greek words as a result of palatalization). Turkish vowel harmony is found in forms such as d√º≈°√ºnd«òzu 'I think', aor. 3sg d√º≈°«ònts√º < d√º≈°«òntsi (Malakopi), from Turkish d√º≈ü√ºnmek, pati≈°√°xƒ±s < pati≈°√°xis 'king' (Delmeso), from Turkish padi≈üah. Cappadocian noun morphology is characterized by the emergence of a generalized agglutinative declension and the progressive loss of grammatical gender distinctions, e.g. to n√©ka 'the (neuter) woman (feminine)', genitive n√©ka-ju, plural n√©kes, genitive n√©kez-ju (Uluaƒüa√ß). Another Turkish feature is the morphological marking of definiteness in the accusative case, e.g. l√≠kos 'wolf (nominative / unmarked indefinite accusative)' vs. l√≠ko 'wolf (marked definite accusative)'. Agglutinative forms are also found in the verb system such as the pluperfect √≠rta ton 'I had come' (lit. 'I came I was') (Delmeso) on the model of Turkish geldi idi (geldiydi). Although Cappadocian word order is essentially governed by discourse considerations such as topic and focus, there is a tendency towards the Turkish subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb word order with its typological correlates (suffixation and pre-nominal grammatical modifiers). The commonality among all Greek Cappadocian dialects is that they evolved from Byzantine Greek under the influence of Turkish. On the other hand, those dialects evolved in isolated villages. This has resulted in a variety of Greek Cappadocian dialects. == Revitalisation == Although Cappadocian Greek was once believed to be a dead language, the discovery of a population of speakers has led to an increase in awareness, both within and outside of the Cappadocian community in Greece. In the documentary Last Words, which follows Mark Janse through Cappadocian- speaking villages on the Greek mainland, community members are seen encouraging each other to use their dialect for ordinary things, such as joke telling. The members of these villages, including such notable figures as the bishop, recount being touched by a presentation given in Cappadocian by Janse on a visit to the region. The bishop went so far as to say that Janse's speech \\"has lifted their shame.\\" The revitalisation process is seen through examples such as this, wherein the speakers have begun to take back their identity and embrace their mother tongue. Additionally, younger generations are embracing the power of technology to spread awareness, utilising social media about the language to inform the larger Greek population. ==Dialects== * Northeastern Cappadocian (Sinasos, Potamia, Delmeso) * Northwestern Cappadocian (Silata or Zila, Anaku, Flojita, Malakopi) * Central Cappadocian (Axo; Misthi) (See Misthiotica) * Southwestern Cappadocian (Aravan, Gurzono; Fertek) * Southeastern Cappadocian (Oulagatz (Uluaƒüa√ß), Semendere) ==See also== * Cappadocian Greeks * Cappadocia * Pharasiot Greek * Silliot Greek * Pontic Greek ==References== ==Bibliography== * ŒëŒΩŒ±œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπŒ¨Œ¥Œ∑œÇ, Œí. 1975.

She then stayed there after her return from the Crimean War for some time before returning for visits whilst living in London. After her death in London in 1910, her body was brought by train back to Romsey and her coffin carried from the station to the church at East Wellow where she is buried. ==The school== A school was first established at Embley Park in 1946.

Runic calendar from the Estonian island of Saaremaa with each month on a separate wooden board. A Runic calendar (also Rune staff or Runic Almanac) is a perpetual calendar, variants of which have been used in Northern Europe until the 19th century. A typical runic calendar consisted of several horizontal lines of symbols, one above the other. Special days like solstices, equinoxes, and celebrations (including Christian holidays and feasts) were marked with additional lines of symbols. Runic calendars were written on parchment or carved onto staves of wood, bone, or horn. The oldest one known, and the only one from the Middle Ages, is a staff from Nyk√∂ping, Sweden, believed to date from the 13th century. Most of the several thousand which survive are wooden calendars dating from the 16th and the 17th centuries. During the 18th century, Runic calendars had a renaissance, and calendars dating from around 1800 were made in the form of brass tobacco boxes. The calendar is based on the 19 year-long Metonic cycle, correlating the Sun and the Moon, but the calendar does not prove knowledge of the length of the tropical year or of the occurrence of leap years. The two sliding halves are aligned and set at the beginning of each year by observing the first full moon after the winter solstice. The first full moon also marked the date of Disting, a pagan feast and a fair day. ==Marks== On one line, 52 weeks of 7 days were laid out using 52 repetitions of the first seven runes of the Younger Futhark. The runes corresponding to each weekday varied from year to year. On another line, many of the days were marked with one of 19 symbols representing the 19 Golden numbers, for the years of the Metonic cycle. In early calendars, each of the 19 years in the cycle was represented by a rune; the first 16 were the 16 runes of the Younger Futhark, plus three special runes for the remaining three years. The new moon would fall on that day during that year of the cycle. For example, in the 18th year of the cycle, the new moons would fall on all the dates marked with tvimadur, the symbol for year 18\\\\. Later calendars used Pentadic numerals for the values 1‚Äì19. Because this system needed 19 runes to represent the 19 golden numbers which stood for the 19 years of the perpetual calendar's cycle, the Younger Futhark was insufficient, having only 16 characters. The solution devised was to add three special runes to represent the remaining numbers: x20px (arlaug; Golden Number 17), x20px (tvimadur or tv√≠ma√∞ur; Golden Number 18), and x20px (belgthor; Golden Number 19). A version using Latin alphabet for weekdays and Arabic numerals for the golden numbers was printed in 1498 as part of the Breviarium Scarense. ==Primstav== Primstav from Hallingdal with coat of arms of Norway, 17th century. A primstav is the ancient Norwegian calendar stick. These were engraved with images instead of runes. The images depicted the different nonmoving religious holidays. The oldest primstav still in existence is from 1457 and is exhibited at Norsk Folkemuseum. == Modern use == Adherents of the Estonian ethnic religion (Maausk) have published Runic calendars () every year since 1978.

The firsthand account of Spanish Royal Notary Hernando Riquel says that he introduced himself to the Spanish as \\"Sibunao Lacandola\\", indicating for later Filipino historians that his given name was \\"Bunao\\". However, the word Lakan which in current Tagalog form means gentleman, was a title equivalent to prince meaning he was Prince Dula. He later converted to Christianity and was baptised Carlos Lacandola.The Philippine revolution and beyond: papers from the International Conference on the Centennial of the 1896 Philippine Revolution, Volume 1, National Commission on Culture and the Arts (Philippines), National Centennial Commission (Philippines), Philippine Centennial Commission [and] National Commission for Culture and the Arts, 1998, p. 111 Another common variation of the name is Gat Dula (alternatively spelled as a single word, Gatdula). He is sometimes erroneously referred to as Rajah Lakandula, but the terms \\"Rajah\\" and \\"Lakan\\" have the same meaning, and in this domain the native Lakan title was used, making the use of both \\"Rajah\\" and \\"Lakandula\\" at the same time redundant and erroneous. Along with Rajah Matanda and Rajah Sulayman, he was one of three rajahs who played significant roles in the Spanish conquest of the Pasig River delta polities during the earliest days of the Philippines' Spanish colonial period. While it is unclear whether the entire name \\"Lakandula\\" represented a single titular name during his own lifetime, a few of his descendants in the first few generations after his death came to refer to themselves as the \\"Lakandula of Tondo\\", taking that name on as a noble title. == Name and title == Over time, Lakandula's name has come to be written in several ways. However, according to the firsthand account written by Hernando Riquel, the royal notary who accompanied Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi, the Lord of Tondo specifically identified himself as \\"Sibunao Lacandola, lord of the town of Tondo\\" when he went onboard Legazpi's ship with the lords of Manila on May 18, 1571. The lords of Manila introduced themselves as \\"Rajah Ache the Old and Rajah Soliman the Young, lords and principals of the town of Manila\\" In page 13 of \\"Cracks in the Parchment Curtain\\", preeminent historian William Henry Scott quotes Riquel's original text, which he found in the Spanish archives under \\"Archivo General de Indias Seccion Patronato leg. 24, no 24.\\" The relevant part of the text read: > ...declaracion llamarse Raha Ache el Viejo y Raha Solimane el Mozo, senores > y principales del pueblo de Manila, y Sibunao Lacandola, principal del > pueblo de Tondo...(emphasis added) Modern historians routinely remove the Filipino word \\"si\\", an article used for personal names, from recorded names in this era because Spanish writers who had not yet learned the local languages often mistakenly included it in Filipino names. Sibunao thus likely comes from \\"[Ako] si Bunao\\" = \\"[I] am Bunao\\". Historians thus take this to mean that the Lakan introduced himself as \\"Bunao Lakandula.\\" === Etymology of \\"Lakandula\\" === Banaw was the given name of the lord of Tondo at the time of the Spanish advent, and his title \\"Lakan\\" denoted a \\"paramount ruler\\" (or more specifically, \\"paramount datu\\") of one of the large coastal settlements (known as a \\"bayan\\" or \\"large barangay\\") of the Tagalog people. This leaves the matter of the addendum \\"dula\\" to be settled. This could not have been a family name such as Filipinos use today, because family names were only introduced to the Filipino culture later, by Governor General Narciso Claver√≠a y Zald√∫a on November 11, 1849.Jernegan, Prescott Ford (1905) \\"A short history of the Philippines: for use in Philippine schools\\". pp. 232-234. D. Appleton and Company, New York. Historian Jose N. Sevilla y Tolentino, however, suggested that Dula was not a personal name at all, but a local word for \\"Palace,\\" such that \\"Lakandula\\" was the local-language title, \\"Lord of the Palace\\" of the rulers of Tondo. Analogously, Rajah Ache was also referred to as Rajah Matanda (Old Rajah), while Rajah Sulayman was sometimes referred to as Rajah Muda or Rajamora (Young Rajah). In the Gatdula variant of the name, the word or prefix Gat is a shortened version of the Tagalog honorific \\"Pamagat\\", which at the time meant \\"nobleman,\\" such that the variant literally read \\"Nobleman of the Palace\\", which meant essentially the same thing as the Kapampangan version. In any case, most contemporary historians continue to refer to him as Lakandula. Where historians such as Dery and Scott explain that his given name is Banaw, they then continue to refer to him as Lakandula. Joaquin does something similar, explaining that the Lakan's given name is Banaw, and then proceeding to call him Lakan Dula (separate words) throughout his \\"Manila, My Manila\\" manuscript. === \\"Lakan\\" instead of \\"Rajah\\" === With the term \\"Rajah\\" and \\"Lakan\\" meaning the same thing, the \\"Rajah Lakandula\\" variation of the title was also never used in the original sources pertaining to Lakan Dula, and Filipino historian and national artist for literature Nick Joaquin takes pains to point out that the term Lakan, not Rajah, was used by the rulers of Tondo. == Life before the arrival of the Spanish == Little is known about the early life of Banaw Lakandula before the arrival of Legazpi. According to National Artist Nick Joaquin \\"he is presumed to be of native birth,\\" with mixed Tagalog and Kapampangan descent. Joaquin adds that \\"He was said to be a descendant of King Balagtas.\\" Joaquin further speculates on Lakandula's religious beliefs: > \\"Tondo's Lakan Dula may have been unusual in being neither foreign nor > muslim. This was indicated by his use of the native term Lakan instead of > the foreign title Rajah. Lakan dula can be presumed‚Ä¶ to have been reared in > the anito cults. One guess is that he converted to islam, then changed his > mind and returned to his native faith.\\" Joaquin also expounds on the economic context of Lakandula's reign over Tondo: > \\"Tondo had replaced Namayan as the chief port of entry on Manila Bay. Tondo > was right on the seaside. This was the advantage it had over Namayan, which > was upriver inland. So the merchant ships that came into the bay preferred > to unload their goods at the port of Tondo. And now it was the king of Tondo > who was responsible for sending the merchandise upriver to the lakeside > communities, there to be traded for local products. Tondo was thus the > distributing center, or entrepot, on the delta... At the time of Lakan Dula, > Tondo was at the height of its career as an entrepot‚Ä¶.\\" According to Scott (1982), when ships from China came to Manila bay, Lakandula would remove the sails and rudders of their ships until they paid him duties and anchorage fees, and then he would then buy up all their goods himself, paying half its value immediately and then paying the other half upon their return the following year. In the interim, he would trade these goods with peoples further upstream, the end result being that other locals were not able to buy anything from the Chinese directly, but from Lakandula, who made a tidy profit as a result. William Henry Scott notes that Augustinian Fray Martin de Rada Legaspi says that the Tagalogs were \\"more traders than warriors\\", and elsewhere notes that Maynila's ships got their goods from Tondo and then dominated trade through the rest of the archipelago. People in other parts of the archipelago often referred to Maynila's boats as \\"Chinese\\" (Sina or Sinina) because they came bearing Chinese goods. == Arrival of Legazpi, May 1571 == When Miguel Lopez de Legazpi came to Manila Bay in May 1571, Lakandula was there to meet him. The two first met on May 17, the day after Legazpi's arrival on the bay, when Lakandula and Rajah Matanda came aboard Legazpi's ship to discuss terms with him. Part of these discussions specified that the Spanish would not land in Tondo, and would instead land in Maynila, which had been burned to the ground the year before. Joaquin suggests that Lakandula would \\"have seen that Legaspi was being practical. Burned down and emptied, Maynila would be a better spot to fortify, being more strategic.\\"In fact, Manila wasn't conquered, but it was occupied through a peace pact that joined Legazpi and the three kings Lakandula, Rajah Ache and Rajah Sulayman.the peaceful king takes his Stand Retrieved on 08 Jan 2018 On May 18, 1571, Rajah Sulayman, Rajah Matanda, and Lakan Dula acknowledged the sovereignty of Spain over the islands and proclaimed themselves the vassals of Spain. On the following day, May 19, Legazpi landed in Manila and took ceremonial possession of the land in the presence of Soliman, Matanda, and Lakandula. Lakandula helped make a house for Legazpi, and a fort for the Spanish, giving them fourteen pieces of artillery and twelve jars of gunpowder, a gift much appreciated by the Spanish, who were running low on ammunition. Soon after, Lakandula and his sons became baptized as Catholics. The Spanish had Manila's artillery and arquebuses discharged in honor of the ceremony. Bunao Lakandula took on the name Don Carlos Lacandola after Charles I of Spain.A history of Brunei, Graham E. Saunders, Routledge, 2002, p. 54 == The Battle of Bangkusay, June 1571 == When the Spaniards first came to Manila they were kindly accepted, but over time the natives understood that it had meant subservience to them. It wasn't long before Spanish power in Luzon was challenged. A first battle took place on 24 May 1570 where the natives were defeated.Battle of Bangkusay: A Paradigm of Defiance against Colonial Conquest Retrieved on 08 Jan 2018 A month later, Tarik Sulayman of Macabebe attacked Manila, convincing Rajah Sulayman to join the battle against Legazpi. Macabebe and Sulayman's forces were defeated, and the Datu of Macabebe was killed in what history would record as the Battle of Bangkusay Channel. (The similarity of names has caused some confusion between these two leaders, but Tarik Sulayman and Rajah Sulayman were different individuals ‚Äì one survived the battle, and the other did not.) Lakandula had refused to join Macabebe and Sulayman's coalition, but among the prisoners taken by the Spanish after the battle were two of his nephews and a number of his officers. When questioned, they said that they had been on the scene only as observers, not as combatants. Legazpi let them go to demonstrate his confidence in Lakandula. Joaquin notes that this was a wise choice on Legaspi's part: > \\"If he had been playing a double game before, Lakan Dula now became earnest > in supporting the Spanish. It may be he who persuaded the fugitive Soliman > to surrender and return to the good graces of Legazpi.\\" == Expedition to Pampanga and Bulacan, late 1571 == Later that year, Legaspi sent Martin de Goiti to spread Spanish rule to the peoples of what are now the provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga, particularly the territories of Lubao with Macabebe, Guagua on September 14, 1571. One month later they conquered Calumpit and Malolos in November 14 of the same year. Legazpi conceded these settlements under Spanish rule. He sent Lakandula and Sulayman with him, because, as one account has it, \\"if so great a chief should go with him, when the Tagalogs and Pampangos saw that he had given obedience to His Majesty, they would give it also.\\" The account continues: > \\"Lacandola agreed to go, and served with two ships provided at his cost, and > distinguished himself by performing much service for His Majesty, and went > along so the said Pampangos would give him obedience, as in fact they did.\\" These boats were joangas (karakoa), a type of seacraft capable of carrying 300 men each, which, as Dery points out, were common in Maritime Southeast Asia. ==Attack by Limahong, 1574== Lakandula's close association with the Spanish continued despite Legaspi's death on August 20, 1572, and his replacement as governor by Guido de Lavezares, who had been the colony's treasurer. The possession of the Islands was unsuccessfully disputed by a rival expedition under the command of a Chinese, Li-ma-hong, a pirate, who had been outlawed by the Celestial Emperor of China. Lakandula was on hand to help repel the invading corsair Limahong when he came to try and sack Manila in 1574.Lakandula was able to raise a rebellion against the Spaniards. The natives of Mindoro Island revolted too but all these disorders were solved by a detachment of soldiers.story of Li-ma-hong and his failed attempt to conquer Manila in 1574 Retrieved on 08 Jan 2018 == Death == Mentions of Lakandula's death are few, but Scott indicates that he died in 1575, \\"three years after\\" Legazpi and Rajah Matanda, who both died in 1572. Lakandula's role as ruler of Tondo was then taken up by his grandnephew, and Rajah Soliman's adopted son, Agustin de Legazpi. Agustin de Legazpi, who was married to the cousin of Sultan Bolkiah, would lead Tondo as a territory under Spanish rule until he rose up against them in 1587‚Äì1588 Revolt of the Lakans, and was deposed and killed as a result. According to Fray Gaspar de San Agustin in \\"Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas 1565‚Äì1615\\", as cited by Kimuell-Gabriel (2013), Lakandula had ruled Tondo from an elevated site near Manila bay, facing the shore and fronted by fishermen's dwellings. According to local oral histories, this site eventually became the site of the Sto Ni√±o of Tondo Parish church.https://web.archive.org/web/20070701181357/http://www.manila- map.com/parish_history.html Gray literature' partly based on == Documentary sources == Primary documentary sources about Lakandula are sparse, so much so that there has been debate about the actual name of the Lakan. Dery identifies three types of sources regarding Lakandula: * direct accounts of Legaspi's 1571 conquest, and indirect references from other documents of the period; * a record group in the Philippine National Archives collectively referred to as the \\"Lacandola Documents\\" containing mostly 18th-century genealogical documents; and * folklore, which \\"suggests prior lineage where documentation definitively identifies only descendants\\". === Direct accounts and references from period documents === In his \\"Bibliographic Essay\\" at the end of his book \\"Barangay:Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society\\", William Henry Scott identifies the three accounts directly detailing the events of Lakandula's lifetime: * An account written by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi himself; * An account by royal notary Hernando Riquel who was part of Legazpi's expedition; and * a third account which is anonymous, but which Scott suggests is probably written by royal notary Hernando Riquel. Scott singles this third account out as particularly useful, because it includes careful observations of the islands and people contacted. Scott also identifies other accounts that don't directly refer to that occasion, but provide additional information about conditions at the time. These include two accounts of the Magellan voyage, reports from the attacks on Borneo in 1578‚Äì79, letters to the king from royal auditor Melchor de Avalos, Reports by later Governors General, passing details in sworn testimony about Augustinian activities (the latter two recorded in Blair and Robertson), Correspondence of Augustinian Fray Martin de Rada, the Relacion accounts of Miguel de Loarca and Juan de Plasencia, and the Boxer Codex, which \\"can be dated to 1590 on internal evidence.\\" == Descendants == === Children === Lakan Dula was the most prolific of Luzon's ancient rulers. His descendants are spread out all across the Kapampangan Region during the Spanish colonial era. Genealogical research by Filipino historian Luciano P.R. Santiago indicate that Lakan Dula fathered at least five children: * Batang Dula, the eldest son of Lakan Bunao Dula; * Don Dionisio Capulong,the Datu of Candaba; * Don Magat Salamat, who would later rule Tondo with his cousin Agustin de Legazpi after Lakandula died, and who was then executed by the Spanish in 1588 for his role in the Revolt of the Lakans; * Don Felipe Salonga, the Datu of Pulu; * Do√±a Maria Poloin, his only historically recorded daughter, who married Don Juan Alonso Talabos; and * Don Martin Lakandula who entered the Augustinian Order as a lay brother in 1590. Other documentary sources also mention a \\"Don Luis Taclocmao\\" (or \\"Salugmoc\\"), a supposed son Lakandula of who was killed in the 1603 Chinese rebellion, fighting the Chinese rebels. === Other relations === Local folk legends recount that conquistador Juan de Salcedo fell in love with an 18-year-old noblewoman called \\"Dayang-dayang Gandarapa\\", who was said to be the niece of Lakandula. === Later descendants === In 1990, Filipino historian Luciano P.R. Santiago wrote an article for the Philippine Quarterly of Culture and Society which details the identities and life stories of some of the descendants of Lakan Dula, mostly based on the \\"Lacandola Documents,\\" a collection of legal documents held by the Philippine National Archives. Another Filipino historian, Luis Camara Dery, in his 2001 book \\"A History of the Inarticulate\\", notes that a purported 1539 document called the \\"Will of Fernando Malang Balagtas,\\" which, although its exact provenance has been determined to be doubtful, corroborates the information from the Lacandola documents..The Lacandola of Arayat came from one of the grandchildren of Lakan Dula of Tondo named Dola, who is from San Luis, Pampanga. When Dola married, she insisted to use the surname Lacandola for her children to maintain connection with his grandfather from Tondo and partly, to hide from Spanish authorities.She was married to a Spanish mestizo surnamed Reyes.Eventually, the Reyes - Lacandola was married into a Macapagal. Dery, Scott, and Santiago recount that the privileges accorded to the descendants of Lakan Dula had been discontinued for a while in the aftermath of Lakan Dula's death, because some of the descendants came into conflict with the Spanish authorities. According to Dery, the Balagtas document recounts that these privileges were restored when a Juan Macapagal, who claimed to be a great grandson of Lakan Dula (through Dionisio Capulong's son Juan Gonzalo Capulong), aided the Spanish authorities in suppressing the 1660 Maniago revolt, the 1660-61 Malong revolt, and the 1661 Almazan revolt, performing his role as Master-of-Camp and Datu of Arayat. In 1758, A Gremio de Lakandulas was created to safeguard the rights and privileges of the Kapampangan descendants of Lakan Dula as assured by the Spanish crown. During the British invasion of 1762‚Äì64, the descendants of Lakan Dula, concentrated in the province of Pampanga, formed a company of volunteers to fight the British and were granted autonomy by Governor General Simon de Anda. Macapagal (rare variant: Makapagal) is a Filipino surname derived from the Kapampangan language.The family claims noble descent from the legitimate grandchildren of Lakandula, the last \\"Áéã\\" or King of Tondo \\"Êù±ÈÉΩ\\" (Dongdu). It is the only known branch of the Seludong's royal family to have survived the Majapahit Empire's invasion, the Sultanate of Brunei's pogrom against native royals, Chinese warlord Limahong's massacres, and the fallout from the Tondo Conspiracy. The family survived due to Martin de Goiti's giving of his Mestiza (Half Aztec and Half-Spanish) daughter in marriage to Batang Dula. As time went on, they incorporated the descendants from the two other royal houses: the house of Rajah Matanda (‡§ã‡§Ö‡§ú ‡§Ç‡§Ö‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§¶) and the house of Tariq Suleiman (ÿ≥ŸÑŸäŸÖÿßŸÜ). The family then migrated to Pampanga and Northern Samar after the Spanish assumed control of Manila. By Santiago's genealogical reckoning, prominent Lakan Dula descendants of the 20th century include the former Philippine Presidents Diosdado Macapagal and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, former Philippine Senate President Jovito Salonga, international stage celebrity Lea Salonga, pioneer Filipino industrialist Gonzalo Puyat, and former Philippine Senate President Gil Puyat. == Legacy == The insignia of the Order of Lakandula *The Order of Lakandula is one of the highest honors given by the Republic of the Philippines.

From his base in Mexico City, he led the expedition to Manila ordered by Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi in 1569. He then engaged in battles against Rajah Sulayman, Rajah Matanda, and Lakandula of the kingdoms in Luzon in order to colonise the land. == The Battles for Manila (1570 ‚Äì 1575) == The Spaniards arrived in Luzon on May 8, 1570, and camped on the shores of Manila Bay for several weeks, while forming an alliance with the Muslims. On May 24, 1570, disputes and hostility erupted between the two groups. The Spaniards occupied the city of Tondo where they were greeted with thousands of warriors. There, they defeated most of Tariq Suleiman's (ÿ≥ŸÑŸäŸÖÿßŸÜ), Rajah Matanda's (‡§ã‡§Ö‡§ú ‡§Ö‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§¶), and Lakan Dula's (ÁéãÊùúÊãâ) people. The Spaniards marched their armies towards the Pasig River, and occupied the settlements in Manila on June 6, 1570 and burned them. Guerrilla warfare broke out following the battle, which continued for about ten months. The Spaniards fortified themselves in the area and constructed their military barracks of Fort Santiago, which became their outpost for trade with Mexico. The Spaniards gained control of the settlements on June 24, 1571, after the arrival of Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi in Manila, who agreed to a peace agreement sealed by betrothing one of his half-caste (Half Aztec and Half Spanish) daughters to Batang Dula, heir apparent of Lakan Dula. Eventually their descendants unified the 3 royal houses of Tariq Suleiman, Rajah Matanda and Lakan Dula with the half-Aztec and half Spanish de Goiti family. The Dula y Goiti family married with the Mendoza family who were Catholic Sephardic Hebrews and to mark the dynasty, changed the surname to Dulay. However, upon the commencement of persecutions the Dulay family's descendants changed their surnames even further and thus we have the Salonga and Macapagal families that are known descendants of these royal houses but subsist under a different family name. The Spanish colonization paved the way for the establishment of Manila as a permanent settlement and capital city of the Spanish East Indies. He later explored Pampanga, Pangasinan and founded several Spanish cities in Luzon between the periods of 1571 -1573. De Goiti, along with other soldiers were granted with haciendas (estates) for the lands they had conquered, by Philip II of Spain. In 1574, De Goiti fought in the war during the invasion of about 3,000 Chinese sea pirates who had sailed from the South China sea. Their leader, Limahong, besieged on the Spanish settlements in Manila. De Goiti was killed by these pirates. Most of the Spanish reinforcements came from Vigan and Cebu. Mart√≠n de Goiti's second in command, Juan de Salcedo left Ilocos Sur, after hearing the news and traveled to Manila where he discovered their settlements had been ceded to the pirates. Salcedo's forces attacked and drove the pirates out of Manila. Limahong and his fleets retreated to Pangasinan where they re-organize their forces. In 1575, Salcedo's army marched north to Pangasinan, in pursuit of the pirates, and besieged them for three months. ==Legacy== De Goiti's remains were laid to rest in a tomb inside the San Agustin Church, in Intramuros. == See also == *Battle of Manila (1574) *History of the Philippines ==References== *de Morga, Antonio.

As a prominent religious figure, he played a leading role in many social justice movements and organizations of the twentieth century. Thurman's theology of radical nonviolence influenced and shaped a generation of civil rights activists, and he was a key mentor to leaders within the civil rights movement, including Martin Luther King Jr. Thurman served as dean of Rankin Chapel at Howard University from 1932 to 1944 and as dean of Marsh Chapel at Boston University from 1953 to 1965. In 1944, he co-founded, along with Alfred Fisk, the first major interracial, interdenominational church in the United States. Howard Thurman died on April 10, 1981 in San Francisco, California. ==Early life and education== Howard Thurman was born in 1899 in Florida in Daytona Beach. He spent most of his childhood in Daytona, Florida, where his family lived in Waycross, one of Daytona's three all-black communities. He was profoundly influenced by his maternal grandmother, Nancy Ambrose, who had been enslaved on a plantation in Madison County, Florida. Nancy Ambrose and Thurman's mother, Alice, were members of Mount Bethel Baptist Church in Waycross and were women of deep Christian faith. Thurman's father, Saul Thurman, died of pneumonia when Howard Thurman was seven years old. After completing eighth grade, Thurman attended the Florida Baptist Academy in Jacksonville, Florida. One hundred miles from Daytona, it was one of only three high schools for African Americans in Florida at the time. In 1923, Thurman graduated from Morehouse College as valedictorian. In 1925, he was ordained as a Baptist minister at First Baptist Church of Roanoke, Virginia, while still a student at Rochester Theological Seminary (now Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School). He graduated from Rochester Theological Seminary in May 1926 as valedictorian in a class of twenty-nine students. From June 1926 until the fall of 1928, Thurman served as pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church in Oberlin, Ohio. In the fall of 1928, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he had a joint appointment to Morehouse College and Spelman College in philosophy and religion. During the spring semester of 1929, Thurman pursued further study as a special student at Haverford College with Rufus Jones, a noted Quaker philosopher and mystic. ==Career== Andrew Rankin Memorial Chapel Thurman was selected as the first dean of Rankin Chapel at Howard University in the District of Columbia in 1932. He served there from 1932 to 1944. He also served on the faculty of the Howard University School of Divinity. Thurman traveled broadly, heading Christian missions and meeting with world figures such as Mahatma Gandhi. When Thurman asked Gandhi what message he should take back to the United States, Gandhi said he regretted not having made nonviolence more visible as a practice worldwide and remarked \\"It may be through the Negroes that the unadulterated message of nonviolence will be delivered to the world.\\". In 1944, Thurman left his tenured position at Howard to help the Fellowship of Reconciliation establish the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples in San Francisco. He served as co-pastor with a white minister, Alfred Fisk. Many of their congregation were African Americans who had migrated to San Francisco from Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas for jobs in the defense industry. The church helped create a new community for many in San Francisco. Thurman was invited to Boston University in 1953, where he became the dean of Marsh Chapel (1953‚Äì1965). He was the first black Dean of Chapel at a majority-white university or college in the United States. In addition, he served on the faculty of Boston University School of Theology. Thurman was also active and well known in the Boston community, where he influenced many leaders. After leaving Boston University in 1965, Thurman continued his ministry as chairman of the board and director of the Howard Thurman Educational Trust in San Francisco until his death in 1981. Thurman was a prolific author, writing twenty books on theology, religion, and philosophy. The most famous of his works, Jesus and the Disinherited (1949), deeply influenced Martin Luther King Jr. and other leaders, both black and white, of the modern Civil Rights Movement. Thurman had been a classmate and friend of King's father at Morehouse College. King visited Thurman while he attended Boston University, and Thurman in turn mentored his former classmate's son and his friends. He served as spiritual advisor to King, Sherwood Eddy, James Farmer, A. J. Muste, and Pauli Murray. At Boston University, Thurman also taught Reb Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, who cited Thurman as among the teachers who first compelled him to explore mystical trends beyond Judaism. ==Marriage and family== Thurman married Katie Kelley on June 11, 1926, less than a month after graduating from seminary. Katie was a 1918 graduate of the Teacher's Course at Spelman Seminary (renamed Spelman College in 1924). Their daughter Olive was born in October 1927. Katie died in December 1930 of tuberculosis, which she had probably contracted during her anti-tuberculosis work. On June 12, 1932, Thurman married Sue Bailey, whom he had met while at Morehouse, when Sue was a student at Spelman. Howard and Sue Bailey Thurman's daughter Anne was born in October 1933. Sue Bailey Thurman was an author, lecturer, historian, civil rights activist, and founder of the Aframerican Women's Journal. She died in 1996. ==Honors and legacy== Howard Thurman House in Daytona Beach, Florida Thurman was named honorary Canon of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York City, in 1974.Letter from Howard Thurman to Charles G. Proffitt, March 29, 1974 (Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, Boston Univ.) The Ebony Magazine called Thurman one of the 50 most important figures in African-American history. In 1953 Life rated Thurman among the twelve most important religious leaders in the United States. In 1986, Dean Emeritus George K. Makechnie founded the Howard Thurman Center at Boston University to preserve and share the legacy of Howard Thurman. In 2020, the Center moved to a larger space occupying two floors in the Peter Fuller Building at 808 Commonwealth Avenue. The Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University holds the Howard Thurman Papers and the Sue Bailey Thurman Papers, where they are catalogued and available to researchers. The Howard Thurman Papers Project was founded in 1992. The Project's mission is to preserve and promote Thurman's vast documentary record, which spans 63 years and consists of approximately 58,000 items of correspondence, sermons, unpublished writings, and speeches. The Howard Thurman Papers Project is located at Boston University School of Theology. Howard University School of Divinity named their chapel the Thurman Chapel in memory of Howard Thurman. Howard Thurman's poem 'I Will Light Candles This Christmas' has been set to music by British composer and songwriter Adrian Payne, both as a song and as a choral (SATB) piece. The choral version was first performed by Epsom Choral Society in December 2007. An arrangement for school choirs, which can be performed in one or two parts with piano accompaniment, was first performed in December 2010. ==Works by Howard Thurman== ===Books=== * The Greatest of These (1944) * Deep River: Reflections on the Religious Insight of Certain of the Negro Spirituals (1945) [also published as The Negro Spiritual Speaks of Life and Death (same year)] * Meditation for Apostles of Sensitiveness (1948) * Jesus and the Disinherited (1949) * Deep is the Hunger: Meditations for Apostles of Sensitiveness (1951) * Christmas Is the Season of Affirmation (1951) * Meditations of the Heart (1953) * The Creative Encounter: An Interpretation of Religion and the Social Witness (1954) * The Growing Edge (1956) * Footprints of a Dream: The Story of the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples (1959) * Mysticism and the Experience of Love (1961) * The Inward Journey: Meditations on the Spiritual Quest (1961) * Temptations of Jesus: Five Sermons Given By Dean Howard Thurman in Marsh Chapel, Boston University, 1962 (1962) * Disciplines of the Spirit (1963) * The Luminous Darkness: A Personal Interpretation of the Anatomy of Segregation and the Ground of Hope (1965) * The Centering Moment (1969) * The Search for Common Ground (1971) * The Mood of Christmas (1973) * A Track to the Water's Edge: The Olive Schreiner Reader (1973) * The First Footprints (1975) * With Head and Heart: The Autobiography of Howard Thurman (1979) * For the Inward Journey: The Writings of Howard Thurman (1984) (selected by Anne Spencer Thurman) === Edited Collections === * Fluker, Walter Earl; et al., eds.

Most real functions that are considered and studied are differentiable in some interval. The most widely considered such functions are the real functions, which are the real-valued functions of a real variable, that is, the functions of a real variable whose codomain is the set of real numbers. Nevertheless, the codomain of a function of a real variable may be any set. However, it is often assumed to have a structure of -vector space over the reals. That is, the codomain may be a Euclidean space, a coordinate vector, the set of matrices of real numbers of a given size, or an -algebra, such as the complex numbers or the quaternions. The structure -vector space of the codomain induces a structure of -vector space on the functions. If the codomain has a structure of -algebra, the same is true for the functions. The image of a function of a real variable is a curve in the codomain. In this context, a function that defines curve is called a parametric equation of the curve. When the codomain of a function of a real variable is a finite- dimensional vector space, the function may be viewed as a sequence of real functions. This is often used in applications. ==Real function== The graph of a real function A real function is a function from a subset of \\\\mathbb R to \\\\mathbb R, where \\\\mathbb R denotes as usual the set of real numbers. That is, the domain of a real function is a subset \\\\mathbb R, and its codomain is \\\\mathbb R. It is generally assumed that the domain contains an interval of positive length. ===Basic examples=== For many commonly used real functions, the domain is the whole set of real numbers, and the function is continuous and differentiable at every point of the domain. One says that these functions are defined, continuous and differentiable everywhere. This is the case of: * All polynomial functions, including constant functions and linear functions * Sine and cosine functions * Exponential function Some functions are defined everywhere, but not continuous at some points. For example * The Heaviside step function is defined everywhere, but not continuous at zero. Some functions are defined and continuous everywhere, but not everywhere differentiable. For example * The absolute value is defined and continuous everywhere, and is differentiable everywhere, except for zero. * The cubic root is defined and continuous everywhere, and is differentiable everywhere, except for zero. Many common functions are not defined everywhere, but are continuous and differentiable everywhere where they are defined. For example: * A rational function is a quotient of two polynomial functions, and is not defined at the zeros of the denominator. * The tangent function is not defined for \\\\frac\\\\pi 2 + k\\\\pi, where is any integer. * The logarithm function is defined only for positive values of the variable. Some functions are continuous in their whole domain, and not differentiable at some points. This is the case of: *The square root is defined only for nonnegative values of the variable, and not differentiable at 0 (it is differentiable for all positive values of the variable). ==General definition == A real-valued function of a real variable is a function that takes as input a real number, commonly represented by the variable x, for producing another real number, the value of the function, commonly denoted f(x). For simplicity, in this article a real- valued function of a real variable will be simply called a function. To avoid any ambiguity, the other types of functions that may occur will be explicitly specified. Some functions are defined for all real values of the variables (one says that they are everywhere defined), but some other functions are defined only if the value of the variable is taken in a subset X of ‚Ñù, the domain of the function, which is always supposed to contain an interval of positive length. In other words, a real-valued function of a real variable is a function :f: X \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} such that its domain X is a subset of ‚Ñù that contains an interval of positive length. A simple example of a function in one variable could be: : V : X \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} : X = \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\,:\\\\, 0 \\\\leq x\\\\\\\\} : f(x) = \\\\sqrt{x} which is the square root of x. ===Image=== The image of a function f(x) is the set of all values of when the variable x runs in the whole domain of . For a continuous (see below for a definition) real-valued function with a connected domain, the image is either an interval or a single value. In the latter case, the function is a constant function. The preimage of a given real number y is the set of the solutions of the equation . === Domain === The domain of a function of several real variables is a subset of ‚Ñù that is sometimes explicitly defined. In fact, if one restricts the domain X of a function f to a subset Y ‚äÇ X, one gets formally a different function, the restriction of f to Y, which is denoted fY. In practice, it is often not harmful to identify f and fY, and to omit the subscript Y. Conversely, it is sometimes possible to enlarge naturally the domain of a given function, for example by continuity or by analytic continuation. This means that it is not worthy to explicitly define the domain of a function of a real variable. === Algebraic structure === The arithmetic operations may be applied to the functions in the following way: * For every real number r, the constant function (x)\\\\mapsto r, is everywhere defined. * For every real number r and every function f, the function rf:(x)\\\\mapsto rf(x) has the same domain as f (or is everywhere defined if r = 0). * If f and g are two functions of respective domains X and Y such that contains an open subset of ‚Ñù, then f+g:(x)\\\\mapsto f(x)+g(x) and f\\\\,g:(x)\\\\mapsto f(x)\\\\,g(x) are functions that have a domain containing . It follows that the functions of n variables that are everywhere defined and the functions of n variables that are defined in some neighbourhood of a given point both form commutative algebras over the reals (‚Ñù-algebras). One may similarly define 1/f:(x)\\\\mapsto 1/f(x), which is a function only if the set of the points in the domain of f such that contains an open subset of ‚Ñù. This constraint implies that the above two algebras are not fields. ===Continuity and limit=== Limit of a real function of a real variable. Until the second part of 19th century, only continuous functions were considered by mathematicians. At that time, the notion of continuity was elaborated for the functions of one or several real variables a rather long time before the formal definition of a topological space and a continuous map between topological spaces. As continuous functions of a real variable are ubiquitous in mathematics, it is worth defining this notion without reference to the general notion of continuous maps between topological space. For defining the continuity, it is useful to consider the distance function of ‚Ñù, which is an everywhere defined function of 2 real variables: d(x,y)=x-y A function f is continuous at a point a which is interior to its domain, if, for every positive real number , there is a positive real number such that f(x)-f(a) <\\\\varepsilon for all x such that d(x,a)<\\\\varphi. In other words, may be chosen small enough for having the image by f of the interval of radius centered at a contained in the interval of length centered at f(a). A function is continuous if it is continuous at every point of its domain. The limit of a real-valued function of a real variable is as follows. Let a be a point in topological closure of the domain X of the function f. The function, f has a limit L when x tends toward a, denoted :L = \\\\lim_{x \\\\rightarrow a} f(x), if the following condition is satisfied: For every positive real number Œµ > 0, there is a positive real number Œ¥ > 0 such that :f(x) - L < \\\\varepsilon for all x in the domain such that :d(x, a)< \\\\delta. If the limit exists, it is unique. If a is in the interior of the domain, the limit exists if and only if the function is continuous at a. In this case, we have :f(a) = \\\\lim_{x \\\\rightarrow a} f(x). When a is in the boundary of the domain of f, and if f has a limit at a, the latter formula allows to \\"extend by continuity\\" the domain of f to a. ==Calculus== One can collect a number of functions each of a real variable, say :y_1 = f_1(x)\\\\,,\\\\quad y_2 = f_2(x)\\\\,,\\\\ldots, y_n = f_n(x) into a vector parametrized by x: :\\\\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, \\\\ldots, y_n) = [f_1(x), f_2(x) ,\\\\ldots, f_n(x)] The derivative of the vector y is the vector derivatives of fi(x) for i = 1, 2, ..., n: :\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{y}}{dx} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{dy_1}{dx}, \\\\frac{dy_2}{dx}, \\\\ldots, \\\\frac{dy_n}{dx}\\\\right) One can also perform line integrals along a space curve parametrized by x, with position vector r = r(x), by integrating with respect to the variable x: :\\\\int_a^b \\\\mathbf{y}(x) \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\int_a^b \\\\mathbf{y}(x) \\\\cdot \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{r}(x)}{dx} dx where ¬∑ is the dot product, and x = a and x = b are the start and endpoints of the curve. ===Theorems=== With the definitions of integration and derivatives, key theorems can be formulated, including the fundamental theorem of calculus integration by parts, and Taylor's theorem. Evaluating a mixture of integrals and derivatives can be done by using theorem differentiation under the integral sign. ==Implicit functions== A real-valued implicit function of a real variable is not written in the form \\"y = f(x)\\". Instead, the mapping is from the space to the zero element in ‚Ñù (just the ordinary zero 0): :\\\\phi: \\\\mathbb{R}^{2} \\\\rightarrow \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} and :\\\\phi(x,y) = 0 is an equation in the variables. Implicit functions are a more general way to represent functions, since if: :y=f(x) then we can always define: : \\\\phi(x, y) = y - f(x) = 0 but the converse is not always possible, i.e. not all implicit functions have the form of this equation. ==One-dimensional space curves in ‚Ñùn== Space curve in 3d. The position vector r is parametrized by a scalar t. At r = a the red line is the tangent to the curve, and the blue plane is normal to the curve. ===Formulation=== Given the functions , , ..., all of a common variable t, so that: :\\\\begin{align} r_1 : \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} & \\\\quad r_2 : \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} & \\\\cdots & \\\\quad r_n : \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\\\\\\\\\ r_1 = r_1(t) & \\\\quad r_2 = r_2(t) & \\\\cdots & \\\\quad r_n = r_n(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} or taken together: :\\\\mathbf{r} : \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\,,\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\mathbf{r}(t) then the parametrized n-tuple, :\\\\mathbf{r}(t) = [r_1(t), r_2(t), \\\\ldots , r_n(t)] describes a one-dimensional space curve. ===Tangent line to curve=== At a point for some constant t = c, the equations of the one-dimensional tangent line to the curve at that point are given in terms of the ordinary derivatives of r1(t), r2(t), ..., rn(t), and r with respect to t: :\\\\frac{r_1(t) - a_1}{dr_1(t)/dt} = \\\\frac{r_2(t) - a_2}{dr_2(t)/dt} = \\\\cdots = \\\\frac{r_n(t) - a_n}{dr_n(t)/dt} ===Normal plane to curve=== The equation of the n-dimensional hyperplane normal to the tangent line at r = a is: :(p_1 - a_1)\\\\frac{dr_1(t)}{dt} + (p_2 - a_2)\\\\frac{dr_2(t)}{dt} + \\\\cdots + (p_n - a_n)\\\\frac{dr_n(t)}{dt} = 0 or in terms of the dot product: :(\\\\mathbf{p} - \\\\mathbf{a})\\\\cdot \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{r}(t)}{dt} = 0 where are points in the plane, not on the space curve. ===Relation to kinematics=== Kinematic quantities of a classical particle: mass m, position r, velocity v, acceleration a. The physical and geometric interpretation of dr(t)/dt is the \\"velocity\\" of a point-like particle moving along the path r(t), treating r as the spatial position vector coordinates parametrized by time t, and is a vector tangent to the space curve for all t in the instantaneous direction of motion. At t = c, the space curve has a tangent vector , and the hyperplane normal to the space curve at t = c is also normal to the tangent at t = c. Any vector in this plane (p ‚àí a) must be normal to . Similarly, d2r(t)/dt2 is the \\"acceleration\\" of the particle, and is a vector normal to the curve directed along the radius of curvature. ==Matrix valued functions== A matrix can also be a function of a single variable. For example, the rotation matrix in 2d: : R(\\\\theta) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos \\\\theta & -\\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin \\\\theta & \\\\cos \\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} is a matrix valued function of rotation angle of about the origin. Similarly, in special relativity, the Lorentz transformation matrix for a pure boost (without rotations): : \\\\Lambda(\\\\beta) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\beta ^2}} & -\\\\frac{\\\\beta }{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\beta ^2}} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\frac{\\\\beta }{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\beta ^2}} & \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\beta ^2}} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} is a function of the boost parameter Œ≤ = v/c, in which v is the relative velocity between the frames of reference (a continuous variable), and c is the speed of light, a constant. ==Banach and Hilbert spaces and quantum mechanics== Generalizing the previous section, the output of a function of a real variable can also lie in a Banach space or a Hilbert space. In these spaces, division and multiplication and limits are all defined, so notions such as derivative and integral still apply. This occurs especially often in quantum mechanics, where one takes the derivative of a ket or an operator. This occurs, for instance, in the general time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation: :i \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\Psi = \\\\hat H \\\\Psi where one takes the derivative of a wave function, which can be an element of several different Hilbert spaces. == Complex-valued function of a real variable== A complex-valued function of a real variable may be defined by relaxing, in the definition of the real-valued functions, the restriction of the codomain to the real numbers, and allowing complex values. If is such a complex valued function, it may be decomposed as : = + , where and are real- valued functions. In other words, the study of the complex valued functions reduces easily to the study of the pairs of real valued functions. == Cardinality of sets of functions of a real variable == The cardinality of the set of real-valued functions of a real variable, \\\\mathbb{R}^\\\\mathbb{R}=\\\\\\\\{f:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\\\\\}, is \\\\beth_2=2^\\\\mathfrak{c}, which is strictly larger than the cardinality of the continuum (i.e., set of all real numbers). This fact is easily verified by cardinal arithmetic: > > \\\\mathrm{card}(\\\\mathbb{R}^\\\\mathbb{R})=\\\\mathrm{card}(\\\\mathbb{R})^{\\\\mathrm{card}(\\\\mathbb{R})}= > \\\\mathfrak{c}^\\\\mathfrak{c}=(2^{\\\\aleph_0})^\\\\mathfrak{c}=2^{\\\\aleph_0\\\\cdot\\\\mathfrak{c}}=2^\\\\mathfrak{c} > . Furthermore, if X is a set such that 2\\\\leq\\\\mathrm{card}(X)\\\\leq\\\\mathfrak{c}, then the cardinality of the set X^\\\\mathbb{R}=\\\\\\\\{f:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to X\\\\\\\\} is also 2^\\\\mathfrak{c}, since > > 2^\\\\mathfrak{c}=\\\\mathrm{card}(2^\\\\mathbb{R})\\\\leq\\\\mathrm{card}(X^\\\\mathbb{R})\\\\leq\\\\mathrm{card}(\\\\mathbb{R}^ > \\\\mathbb{R})=2^\\\\mathfrak{c}. However, the set of continuous functions C^0(\\\\mathbb{R})=\\\\\\\\{f:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}:f\\\\ \\\\mathrm{continuous}\\\\\\\\} has a strictly smaller cardinality, the cardinality of the continuum, \\\\mathfrak{c}. This follows from the fact that a continuous function is completely determined by its value on a dense subset of its domain. Thus, the cardinality of the set of continuous real-valued functions on the reals is no greater than the cardinality of the set of real-valued functions of a rational variable. By cardinal arithmetic: > > \\\\mathrm{card}(C^0(\\\\mathbb{R}))\\\\leq\\\\mathrm{card}(\\\\mathbb{R}^\\\\mathbb{Q})=(2^{\\\\aleph_0})^{\\\\aleph_0}=2^{\\\\aleph_0\\\\cdot\\\\aleph_0}= > 2^{\\\\aleph_0}=\\\\mathfrak{c}. On the other hand, since there is a clear bijection between \\\\mathbb{R} and the set of constant functions \\\\\\\\{f:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}: f(x)\\\\equiv x_0\\\\\\\\}, which forms a subset of C^0(\\\\mathbb{R}), \\\\mathrm{card}(C^0(\\\\mathbb{R}))\\\\geq\\\\mathfrak{c} must also hold. Hence, \\\\mathrm{card}(C^0(\\\\mathbb{R}))=\\\\mathfrak{c}. ==See also== *Real analysis *Function of several real variables *Complex analysis *Several complex variables ==References== * * * ==External links== *Multivariable Calculus *L.

","title":"Gili"},{"id":"1268975","text":"Gili Islands & Mount Rinjani, Lombok, Indonesia. The Gili Islands ( [Three Gilis], Kepulauan Gili [Gili Islands]) are an archipelago of three small islands or Gili island triplets ‚Äî Gili Trawangan, Gili Meno and Gili Air ‚Äî just off the northwest coast of Lombok, Indonesia. The islands are a tourist destination. Each island has several resorts, usually consisting of a collection of huts for tourists, a small pool and restaurant. Most local inhabitants live on Trawangan, in a township stretching along its east side just inland (which is also where most recent development is taking place). Automobiles and motorized traffic are prohibited on the islands by local ordinance, so the preferred method of transportation is by foot and bicycle or the horse-drawn carriage called a cidomo. Scuba diving and free diving in and around the Gilis is also common due to the abundance of marine life and coral formations. Most famous diving spots are Shark point, Manta point and Simon's reef.Lonely Planet guide to Bali & Lombok, Lonely Planet Publications, Melbourne, (2005) ==Etymology== The name \\"Gili Islands\\" is a misnomer, because Gili simply means \\"small island\\" in Sasak. As a result, most of the islands around the coast of Lombok have Gili in their names, although confusion is averted by referring (in English) to the other Gilis around the Lombok coast by their proper names only. The Indonesian word for water is Air () and Gili Air was named for being the only island of the three to have subterranean fresh water. This is acknowledged as a finite resource with some resorts and restaurants shipping in the water from the mainland. ==Geography and climate== The Islands are located in the Lombok Strait, to the immediate northwest of Lombok. They extend outward from a tiny peninsula called Sire near to the village of Tanjung on Lombok. Bali lies about 35 km to the west of Gili Trawangan, the islands' most westerly member. Both Bali and Lombok are easily visible from the Gilis in clear weather. Mount Rinjani, Indonesia's second highest volcano, is close by on neighbouring Lombok, and dominates the views towards the east. Due to their close proximity to the Equator, the Islands have a warm, tropical climate with a dry and wet season. With Mount Rinjani to the immediate east on Lombok, and Mount Agung to the west on Bali, The Gilis are somewhat sheltered and actually enjoy a slightly drier microclimate when compared to the surrounding archipelago. Dry Season usually lasts from May until October, with monsoon season starting in November and continuing through to April. Temperatures range between 22 ¬∞C to 34 ¬∞C, with an average annual temperature of around 28 ¬∞C. ==History== Due to their small size and population, and relatively recent settlement of the islands, published sources are limited. Where local knowledge has been used, those cited are elected local officials whose details are listed in the references section. For more detailed regional historical information, visit the Lombok article. For a brief period during the Second World War, occupying Japanese forces used the islands as a lookout post and prisoner of war camp. Relics from this period include the remains of a bunker on the hill of Gili Trawangan, and the wreck of a patrol boat submerged at a depth of 45 m in the bay to the south of Gili Air (now a popular dive site). Permanent settlement only began in the 1970s, mainly due to the lack of fresh water sources before that time. Prior to human settlement, these islands remained pristine wildlife mangrove habitats. Initially, Bugis fishermen used the islands as a stop off location for their voyages around the archipelago. In 1971 the governor of Lombok, Wasita Kusama, began to establish coconut plantations and gave land rights to private companies. 350 inmates from overcrowded Mataram prison were sent to help with the first harvests between 1974 and 1979, many of whom remained on the Islands as permanent settlers.http://marlionllc.com/charm-gili-trawangan/ Following various difficulties with coconut harvests, the private efforts to exploit the islands' plantations were abandoned. The local population grew beyond their allocated bounds (100 hectares) and began to erect homes and businesses on the private, abandoned land. This led to a land dispute that continues to the present. In the 1980s, the islands started to be discovered by backpacker tourists. This was influenced by the exponential rise of tourism in neighbouring Bali. At first, Gili Air (having the most infrastructure at the time) began to transform to cater to this new economy. However, Gili Trawangan soon surpassed it due mostly to its proximity to better dive locations. As the prospects for tourism on the islands began to rise in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the government and investors whose abandoned land had been settled on by an expanding population, began to regain interest in the potential for development. This resulted in a series of evictions and demolishing of local homes and businesses, followed each time by inaction on the part of the developers and the rebuilding of destroyed homes by residents who opposed the eviction. The first tourist accommodation on Gili Trawangan was a small homestay called Pak Majid, built in 1982, by Pak (\\"polite Mr\\") Majid. This was eventually taken over in 2007 and transformed into Pesona Resort and Restaurant (the first Indian restaurant on the Gilis). Most of the locally owned businesses from the 1980s have been acquired by westerners. The longest standing locally owned and operated business is \\"Goodheart\\" resort, originally built in 1987 and rebuilt three times following demolition relating to the ongoing land dispute. Gili Trawangan gained a reputation from the late 1980s to the late 1990s as a party island. Drugs were freely available on the island and its low population and remoteness required no police presence at the time. During the 1990s, the diving industry grew swiftly and the islands began to develop into a world class diving instruction location. This fed local tourism and in the new millennium a wider spectrum of accommodation and entertainment began to be developed that catered to a broader range of visitors. In 2000, a non-profit organisation by the name of Gili Eco Trust was established to help protect the coral reefs surrounding the islands and improve environmental education. It originated as a co-operation between influential members of the local community (Satgas) and the dive shops on Gili Trawangan and was initiated by the owners of Manta Dive. Many projects have since been organised to protect and restore coral reefs, improve waste management, struggle against erosion, treat animals, raise awareness and educate. This was needed as damage had occurred due to a particularly warm El Ni√±o and unsustainable local fishing methods. In 2005, fast boat operations began from neighbouring Bali, the first company being Blue Water Express, they still operate to the islands. Following them, fast boat services from several operators commenced services from various points around Bali and Nusa Lembongan, to the Islands. The fast boat service are : Wahana Gili Ocean, Eka Jaya Fast Boat, BlueWater Express, Mahi Mahi Dewata, Scoot Fast Cruises, Marina Srikandi, and more. , the islands continue to experience rapid growth and development related to the tourism industry. Efforts are being made to preserve marine habitats and remain culturally distinct from neighbouring Bali in this process. The aforementioned land dispute remains unresolved. ==Gili Trawangan== Sunset, Gili Trawangan Gili Trawangan as seen from Gili Meno. Gili Trawangan is the largest of Lombok's Gili Islands and the only one to rise significantly (30 m) above sea level. Measuring 3 km long and 2 km wide, it has a population of around 1500 (see demography). The name Trawangan originates from the Indonesian word Terowongan (Tunnel) due to the presence of a cave tunnel built there during Japanese occupation in World War 2. Japanese presence during the second world war was on elevated topography in the South of the island, where anti-aircraft guns were housed. Only the base of the AA guns remains at the end of the tunnel. Of the Gilis, Trawangan is the most developed and geared towards tourism. The main concentration of settlement, recreation, accommodation and diving business is situated on the eastern side of the island. A local pub, T√≠r na N√≥g claims that Trawangan is the smallest island in the world with an Irish pub. It was previously administered under Lombok Barat Regency along with Senggigi until 2010 when the Gili islands came under the jurisdiction of the new North Lombok Regency (Kabupaten Lombok Utara).http://marlionllc.com/north-lombok-regency/ On Gili Trawangan (as well as the other two Gilis), there are no motorised vehicles. The main means of transportation are bicycles (rented by locals to tourists) and cidomo (a small horse-drawn carriage). For travelling to and from each of the Gilis, locals usually use motorised boats and speedboats. Some of the first inhabitants of Gili Trawangan were fishermen and farmers from Sulawesi. Previous to human settlement Gili Trawangan was covered in forest and deer lived on the island. (Source: Inhabitants of Gili Trawangan ‚Äî no printed source available). The economy of Gili Trawangan centres on tourism, as the island is too small to support any broad scale agriculture, and too remote to allow economically viable industry or commerce. There is a mosque on the island. ===Drug tourism=== Gili Trawangan has had a reputation since the 1980s as a location where drugs are freely available. Psilocybin mushrooms are openly advertised on the island, and a range of harder drugs have been known to be in circulation. Though police presence is low, Indonesian drug laws are extremely harsh and thus strictly speaking drug possession and use is prohibited and carries potentially grave risk (up to and including the death penalty). Although the 'drug tourism' (and tourism in general) began on Gili Trawangan, in the last 10 years finding drugs on Gili Air and Gili Meno has become very open and easy as well. Especially on Gili Air which has more intense psychedelics being sold openly to tourists for beach parties. Gili Trawangan is also the only island out of the 3 Gili Islands that has any active law enforcement. This makes it much more difficult for harder drugs (such as cocaine or ecstasy) to be sold, and deters drug dealers from staying there. Gili Meno and Gili Air have no police and any issues need to be dealt with at the police station in Lombok. ==Gili Meno== Gili Meno is the middle of Lombok's three northwest coast Gilis. Gili Meno has a population of about 500, mainly concentrated on the centre of the island (see section on demography). The main income comes from tourism, coconut plantation and fishing. On the west side of the island there is a small shallow lake that produces salt in the dry season. Until a few years ago there was also a small production of seaweed on the reef at the north end of the island. Gili Meno has swimming beaches all around the island, and a turtle sanctuary. The island attracts fewer tourists than Gili Trawangan and is the quietest and smallest of the islands. However, honeymooners are often drawn to the crystal clear water and idyllic, secluded white beaches. Since early 2017 fresh water was installed on the island and is supplied by underwater pipes from Lombok. Electricity is supplied by underwater cables from Lombok. There are no cars or motorbikes. ==Gili Air== Mount Rinjani from the south coast of Gili Air Gili Air is the second smallest of the islands and the closest to mainland Lombok, making it popular with honeymoon couples and travellers seeking a quiet retreat. It has a population of about 1,800. The island offers excellent snorkelling and scuba diving off its east coast, and turtles can be seen along the coral reef. Other water sports such as Stand Up Paddleboarding and Kitesurfing are also now available. An Indonesian cooking school has opened its door on the harbour in 2015 Gili Cooking Classes. Gili Air also has a public gym. Continued investment in tourism is resulting in rapid development of the islands, and each year sees new resorts and accommodation on the islands while attempting to retain their individual character. Proximity to Gili Meno, the smallest and most secluded of the islands and to Gili Trawangan the largest island, known for its many restaurants and parties, makes Gili Air a destination that combines relative seclusion with adequate services. Both other Islands are a quick boat ride away. ==Transport== There is no motorised transport on the Islands apart from electric scooters. The short distances on land are traversed on foot, by bicycle or Cidomo. The Islands can only be reached by sea, and are frequented by a variety of fast boats operating various routes from Bali. *There are direct boat services from Bali and Lombok to the Gili Islands. * Flights from Ngurah Rai International Airport to Lombok International Airport take about 40 minutes followed by a 2 h taxi ride to Bangsal harbour in Northwest Lombok and a Local boat to the Gili Islands for a further 20-30mins. * Public Ferries depart from Padang Bai (Southeast Bali) every hour, taking a minimum of 4‚Äì5 hours to reach Lembar (Southwest Lombok), after which a taxi can be taken for a 2 h drive to Bangsal harbour where local boats to the Gili Islands await during daylight hours. *Fast boats depart daily from Padang Bai (Southeast Bali), Serangan (South Bali) and Amed (North East Bali) with an average crossing time of 1.5 hours. Booking your e-ticket can be done online at or DuckFerries and will mostly be cheaper than the counter prices. Prices start from US$18 one way and US$32 return trip. == Earthquake disaster == Joko Widodo examining the earthquake damage. The August 2018 Lombok earthquake killed 20 people and injured hundreds more, the earthquake caused significant damage to Lombok island and was the foreshock of a larger earthquake that followed 8 days later. The August 2018 Lombok earthquake occurred on August 5, 2018 and had a moment magnitude of 6.9 and caused catastrophic damage to North Lombok and also caused damage to nearby Bali, The earthquake caused up to 563 deaths and injured hundreds more. ==Gallery== File:Gili Meno West Coast.jpgView of the west coast of Gili Meno looking south ‚Äî Lombok is in the distance File:Gili Trawangan.jpgView of Trawangan Pier and a Cidomo, local transport File:Gili Trawangan Dawn 2.jpgView from the top of the hill on Gili Trawangan just after dawn; foreground is Gili Trawangan, Gili Meno is next and then Gili Air ‚Äî Gunung Rinjani is backlit by the approaching dawn File:Gunung Rinjani from Gili Trawangan 1.jpgView from Gili Trawangan; in the foreground are island hopper boats anchored off Gili Trawangan, Gili Meno is the next island ‚Äî Ginung Rinjani is in the distance File:Gili Trawangan.jpegGili Trawangan ==References== Category:Lesser Sunda Islands Category:Underwater diving sites in Indonesia ","title":"Gili Islands"},{"id":"1268976","text":"The Karamanlides (; ), or simply Karamanlis, are a Greek Orthodox, Turkish- speaking people native to the Karaman and Cappadocia regions of Anatolia. Today, a majority of the population live in Greece, though there is a sizeable diaspora in Western Europe and North America. ==Etymology== Karamanlides were Greek-Orthodox Christians in Central Anatolia who spoke Turkish as their primary language. The term is geographical, derived from the 13th century Beylik of Karaman. This was the first Turkish kingdom to use Turkish as its official language and originally the term would only refer to the inhabitants of the town of Karaman or from the region of Karaman. ==Language== Sille, near Konya. Historically, the Karamanlides spoke Karamanlƒ± Turkish. Its vocabulary drew overwhelmingly from Turkic words with many Greek loan words. The language should not be confused with Cappadocian Greek, which was spoken in the same region during the same timeframe, but is derived from the Greek language. While the official Ottoman Turkish was written in the Arabic script, the Karamanlides used the Greek alphabet for writing its form of Turkish. Such texts are called Karamanlidika (ŒöŒ±œÅŒ±ŒºŒ±ŒΩŒªŒÆŒ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ± / ŒöŒ±œÅŒ±ŒºŒ±ŒΩŒªŒÆŒ¥ŒµŒπŒ± Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒÆ) or Karamanlƒ± Turkish today. Karamanlƒ± Turkish had its own literary tradition and produced numerous published works in print in the 19th century, some of them published by Evangelinos Misailidis, by the Anatoli or Misailidis publishing house (Misailidis 1986, p. 134). Karamanlƒ± writers and speakers were expelled from Turkey as part of the Greek-Turkish population exchange of 1923. Some speakers preserved their language in the diaspora. The writing form stopped being used immediately after the Turkish state adopted the Latin alphabet. A fragment of a manuscript written in Karamanlƒ± was also found in the Cairo Geniza.Julia Krivoruchko Karamanli ‚Äì a new language variety in the Genizah: T-S AS 215.255 http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/Taylor- Schechter/fotm/july-2012/index.html ==Origins== The origins of the Karamanlides have long been disputed, there being two basic theories on the subject. According to one, they are the remnants of the Greek-speaking Byzantine population which, though it remained Orthodox, was linguistically Turkified. The second theory holds that they were originally Turkish soldiers which the Byzantine emperors had settled in Anatolia in large numbers and who retained their language and Christian religion after the Turkish conquests.Vryonis, Speros. Studies on Byzantium, Seljuks, and Ottomans: Reprinted Studies. Undena Publications, 1981, , p. 305. \\"The origins of the Karamanlides have long been disputed, there being two basic theories on the subject.

Early estimates placed the number of Orthodox Christians expelled from central and southern Anatolia at around 100,000.Blanchard, Raoul. \\"The Exchange of Populations Between Greece and Turkey.\\" Geographical Review, 15.3 (1925): 449-56. However, the Karamanlides were numbered at around 400,000 at the time of the exchange.Pavlowitch, Stevan K. A History of the Balkans, 1804-1945.

They numbered some 400,000 at the time of the 1923 exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey.\\" ==Culture== The distinct culture that developed among the Karamanlides blended elements of Orthodox Christianity with a Greek-Ottoman flavor that characterized their willingness to accept and immerse themselves in foreign customs. From the 14th to the 19th centuries, they enjoyed an explosion in literary refinement. Karamanli authors were especially productive in philosophy, religious writings, novels, and historical texts. Lyrical poetry in the late 19th century describes their confusion they felt as a Turkish- speaking people with a Greek ethos,a problem which reminds the German-speaking French people of Lorraine and the French-speaking English people. ==References== ==External links== Category:Cappadocian Greeks Category:Ethnic groups in Greece Category:Ethnic groups in Turkey Category:Anatolia Category:History of Cappadocia Category:Turkish people of Greek descent Category:Turkic Christians ","title":"Karamanlides"},{"id":"1268979","text":"Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor or Isaac Elhanan Spector (; 1817 - March 6, 1896) was a Russian rabbi, posek and Talmudic sage of the 19th century. == Early life == Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor was born in Ros', Belarus (Yiddish: Rosh), then part of the Grodno Governorate of the Russian Empire. His father, Israel Issar, was rabbi of Resh and Yitzchak Elchanan's first teacher. His father had a leaning toward Hasidism. Yitzchak Elchanan made remarkable progress in his Talmudical studies, and was soon famous as an illui (prodigy). At the age of thirteen he married, and settled with his wife's parents in Vilkovisk, where he remained for six years. He was for a short time the pupil of Elijah Schick, and later he studied under Benjamin Diskin, rabbi of Vilkovisk, who, much impressed by his agreeable manners and great ability, accepted him as a pupil and as the fellow student of his son Joshua Leib Diskin, afterward rabbi of Brisk. Spektor received his semikhah (rabbinic ordination) from Benjamin Diskin and from R. Isaac ·∏§aber of Tiktin (later of Suwa≈Çki). The 300 rubles which his wife had brought him as dowry were lost through the bankruptcy of his debtor. Being unable to rely any longer on his father-in-law for support, Spector became rabbi in 1837 of the small adjacent town of Sabelin, with a weekly salary of five Polish gulden. He remained there in great poverty for about two years, when he went to Karlin and introduced himself to R. Jacob of that town (author of \\"Mishkenot Ya'a·∏≥ob\\"), then considered one of the foremost rabbis of Russia. Jacob was so favorably impressed by the extensive learning and the carefulness of the young man that he recommended him to the first community desiring a rabbi, namely, that of Baresa (Biaroza), where the salary was one ruble a week. Spektor entered upon his new charge in 1839, and made rapid progress. A dispute which he had with Rabbi Isaac of Shavel concerning the formula of a document relating to divorce ended when Isaac, who was much older and better known than Spektor, acknowledged Spektor to be in the right. == Rabbinical positions == In 1846, Spektor was chosen as rabbi of Nishvez, Minsk Governorate, but the community of Baresa was unwilling to let him go, and he was obliged to leave the town at night. The salary of his new position, four rubles a week, was a munificent one for those days; and at first many of the older members of the community objected to so young a rabbi. After he had become known, however, his popularity was such that when he decided to accept the rabbinate of Novohrodok (Kovno Governorate), whose community had exonerated him of a false charge made against him by an informer of Nishvez, the people of the latter town wished to restrain him; he had to leave it, as he had left Baresa, stealthily at night. He went to Novohrodok in May, 1851, and remained there until the same month in 1864, when he was appointed chief rabbi of Kovno, which he occupied until his death. Spektor was an indefatigable worker, and in the last forty years of his life, when he was steadily becoming more generally recognized as the foremost rabbinical authority in Russia, he maintained a large correspondence with rabbis, communities, philanthropists, and representative men in many parts of the world, who sought his advice and instruction on all conceivable subjects relating to Jews and Judaism. He early began to take an interest in general Jewish affairs, and his sound reasoning, his liberal views, and his love of peace combined to establish him as one of the great leaders of Russian Jewry. In 1857 he was the youngest member of a committee of rabbis chosen to regulate the management of the Volozhin yeshiva. Ten years later he settled a quarrel which threatened to ruin the Mir Yeshiva. In 1868, he stood at the head of a committee to help the poor during a drought which almost produced a famine, and he allowed as a temporary measure the use of peas and beans in the Passover of that year. In 1875, he decided against the use of the Corfu Citron as Etrog, because of the exorbitant price to which they had risen. In 1879 he arranged, through Prof. A. Harkavy, his former pupil, that three rabbis, Reuben of D√ºnaburg, Lipa Boslansky of Mir, and Elijah Eliezer Grodzenski of Vilna, should be added to the official rabbinical commission, which had hitherto consisted entirely of men of affairs and secular scholars. == Relations with the Russian government == Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor Together with Yisrael Salanter, he bravely fought the harsh decrees of the Russian government and was active in confronting the numerous issues affecting Russian Jewry. Twice Spektor visited St. Petersburg to take part in the conferences held there to consider the situation of the Jews after the riots of 1881. During his second visit, in the summer of 1882, Kovno was partly destroyed by fire, and Spektor collected in the capital a large sum for those who had been ruined by the conflagration. He succeeded in his opposition to the proposed establishment of a new rabbinical school on the plan of those in Vilna and Zhitomir, but he failed in his attempt to induce the government to recognize as the real head of the Jewish communities the synagogue rabbi instead of the government rabbi, who was in reality only a civil functionary and a layman. In 1889, Spektor was elected an honorary member of the Society for the Promotion of Culture Among the Jews of Russia; in the same year he declared himself emphatically opposed to the proposed celebration of his rabbinical jubilee. His efforts to save the Volozhin yeshiva from being closed by the government proved unsuccessful, but his sponsorship of the institution known as \\"Kovnoer Perushim\\" assisted to provide a substitute. His other varied activities included participation in the Kovno kollel and membership of the Hovevei Zion movement. He corresponded with the leading rabbis of western Europe, and was the anonymous friend who induced Samson Raphael Hirsch to write Ueber die Beziehung des Talmuds zum Judenthum (an 1884 defense of Talmudic literature against anti-Semitic slanders in Russia). In his later years he was revered by the Jews of Russia, and came to be considered the pre-eminent halakhic (Jewish law) authority of his time; his death caused mourning in Orthodox communities throughout the world. Spektor died at Kovno on 6 March 1896. Various institutions were named after him, including Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS, part of Yeshiva University) and the Knesses Beis Yitzchok Kaminetz of Baruch Ber Leibowitz. He had three sons: Chayyim, who was the son- in-law of R. Joseph B√∂hmer of Slutzk, and died in Kovno in 1874, aged forty; Benjamin Rabinovich; and Hirsch Rabinovich, who was maggid or preacher of Wilna, and later succeeded his father as rabbi of Kovno. An only daughter, named Rachel, died at an early age in 1876. ==Works== Spektor was the author of the following works, which are considered authoritative by rabbinical scholars: * Be'er Yitzchak, (K√∂nigsberg, 1858), responsa * Ein Yitzchak, (part i., Wilna, 1889; part ii., ib. 1895), responsa * Nachal Yitzchak, (part i., Wilna, 1872; part ii., ib. 1884), on parts of the Shulchan 'Aruk, Choshen Mishpat ==References== *Rabbi Ephraim Shimoff: Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Spektor - Life and letters. *Jacob ha-Levi Lipschitz (Spektor's secretary for twenty-six years), Toledot Yi·∫ì·∏•a·∏≥, Warsaw, 1897 (in Yiddish, Gaon Yi·∫ì·∏•a·∏≥, Wilna, 1899); *Der Israelit, Mayence, 1897, No. 15; *Eisenstadt, Dor Rabbanaw we-Soferaw, iii. 31-33, Wilna, 1901; *Eliezer Hillel Aronson, Erez ba-Lebanon, Frankfort- on-the-Main, 1879; *Rosenfeld, Sha'at ha-Kosher, in A·∏•iasaf, 5659 (1899), pp. 71-80. * ==External links== *Biography Rabbi Yitzchok Elchanan Spektor *Spektor family Category:1817 births Category:1896 deaths Category:19th- century Lithuanian writers Category:19th-century rabbis Category:Belarusian Orthodox rabbis Category:Exponents of Jewish law Category:Haredi rabbis in Europe Category:Lithuanian male writers Category:Lithuanian Orthodox rabbis Category:Writers from Kaunas Category:Later Acharonim Category:Authors of books on Jewish law ","title":"Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor"},{"id":"1268981","text":"Sleep hygiene is a behavioral and environmental practice developed in the late 1970s as a method to help people with mild to moderate insomnia but, , the evidence for effectiveness of individual recommendations is \\"limited and inconclusive\\". Clinicians assess the sleep hygiene of people who present with insomnia and other conditions, such as depression, and offer recommendations based on the assessment. Sleep hygiene recommendations include establishing a regular sleep schedule, using naps with care, not exercising physically or mentally too close to bedtime, limiting worry, limiting exposure to light in the hours before sleep, getting out of bed if sleep does not come, not using bed for anything but sleep and sex, avoiding alcohol as well as nicotine, caffeine, and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime, and having a peaceful, comfortable and dark sleep environment. ==Assessment== Assessing sleep hygiene is important to determine whether an individual has inadequate sleep hygiene disorder. The diagnostic assessment is usually conducted using clinical interview and supplemented by self-report questionnaires and sleep diaries, which are typically kept from one to two weeks, to record a representative sample data. There are also computerized assessments such as the Sleep-EVAL system, which can be employed in the diagnostic process. It features 1,543 possible questions automatically selected according to the individual's previous answers. Practice of sleep hygiene and knowledge of sleep hygiene practices can be assessed with measures such as the Sleep Hygiene Index, Sleep Hygiene Awareness and Practice Scale, or the Sleep Hygiene Self-Test. For younger individuals, sleep hygiene can be assessed by the Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale or the Children's Sleep Hygiene Scale. ==Recommendations== Clinicians choose among recommendations for improving sleep quality for each individual and counselling is presented as a form of patient education.Hauri, P. (2011). Sleep/wake lifestyle modifications: Sleep hygiene. In Barkoukis TR, Matheson JK, Ferber R, Doghramji K, eds. Therapy in Sleep Medicine. Elsevier Saunders, Philadelphia, PA. pp. 151‚Äì60. ===Sleep schedule=== One set of recommendations relates to the timing of sleep. For adults, getting less than 7‚Äì8 hours of sleep is associated with a number of physical and mental health deficits, and therefore a top sleep hygiene recommendation is allowing enough time for sleep. Clinicians will frequently advise that these hours of sleep are obtained at night instead of through napping, because while naps can be helpful after sleep deprivation, under normal conditions naps may be detrimental to nighttime sleep. Negative effects of napping on sleep and performance have been found to depend on duration and timing, with shorter midday naps being the least disruptive. There is also focus on the importance of awakening around the same time every morning and generally having a regular sleep schedule. ===Activities=== Exercise is an activity that can facilitate or inhibit sleep quality; people who exercise experience better quality of sleep than those who do not, but exercising too late in the day can be activating and delay falling asleep. Increasing exposure to bright and natural light during the daytime and avoiding bright light in the hours before bedtime may help promote a sleep-wake schedule aligned with nature's daily light-dark cycle. Activities that reduce physiological arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed has been shown to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised to get out of bed and try something else for a brief amount of time. Generally, for people experiencing difficulties with sleep, spending less time in bed results in deeper and more continuous sleep, so clinicians will frequently recommend eliminating use of the bed for any activities except sleep (or sex). ===Foods and substances=== A number of foods and substances have been found to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding nicotine, caffeine (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain relievers), and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. Smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime. Lastly, limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations. ===Sleep environment=== Arranging a sleep environment that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures have been shown to disrupt continuous sleep. Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, bedding, and pillows, and eliminating a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall asleep. In 2015, a systematic review of studies on mattresses concluded that medium-firm, custom- inflated mattresses were best for pain and neutral spinal alignment. ==Effectiveness== Sleep hygiene studies use different sets of sleep hygiene recommendations, and the evidence that improving sleep hygiene improves sleep quality is weak and inconclusive . Most research on sleep hygiene principles has been conducted in clinical settings, and there is a need for more research on non-clinical populations. The strength of research support for each recommendation varies; some of the more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and trying too hard to fall asleep. There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights. There is support showing positive sleep outcomes for people who follow more than one sleep hygiene recommendation. While there is inconclusive evidence that sleep hygiene alone is effective as a treatment for insomnia, some research studies have shown improvement in insomnia for patients who receive sleep hygiene education in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy practices. ==Special populations== Sleep hygiene is a central component of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Sleep hygiene recommendations have been shown to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of insomnia. Specific sleep disorders may require other or additional treatment approaches, and continuing difficulties with sleep may require additional assistance from healthcare providers. College students are at risk of engaging in poor sleep hygiene and also of being unaware of the resulting effects of sleep deprivation. Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment, college students may be likely to have variable sleep-wake schedules across the week, take naps, drink caffeine or alcohol near bedtime, and sleep in disruptive sleeping environments. Because of this, researchers recommend sleep hygiene education on college campuses. Harvard University, for example, requires all incoming first-year undergraduates to take a short online course on the subject before the fall semester begins.Sleep 101: Harvard Freshmen Required To Take Sleep Course Before School Begins Similarly, shift workers have difficulty maintaining a healthy sleep-wake schedule due to night or irregular work hours. Shift workers need to be strategic about napping and drinking caffeine, as these practices may be necessary for work productivity and safety, but should be timed carefully. Because shift workers may need to sleep while other individuals are awake, additional sleeping environment changes should include reducing disturbances by turning off phones and posting signs on bedroom doors to inform others when they are sleeping. Due to symptoms of low mood and energy, individuals with depression may be likely to have behaviors that are counter to good sleep hygiene, such as taking naps during the day, consuming alcohol near bedtime, and consuming large amounts of caffeine during the day. In addition to sleep hygiene education, bright light therapy can be a useful treatment for individuals with depression. Not only can morning bright light therapy help establish a better sleep-wake schedule, but it also has been shown to be effective for treating depression directly, especially when related to seasonal affective disorder. Individuals with breathing difficulties due to asthma or allergies may experience additional barriers to quality sleep that can be addressed by specific variations of sleep hygiene recommendations. Difficulty with breathing can cause disruptions to sleep, reducing the ability to stay asleep and to achieve restful sleep. For individuals with allergies or asthma, additional considerations must be given to potential triggers in the bedroom environment. Medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair sleep in other ways, so there must be careful management of decongestants, asthma controllers, and antihistamines. ==Implementation== Sleep hygiene strategies include advice about timing of sleep and food intake in relationship to exercise and sleeping environment. Recommendations depend on knowledge of the individual situation; counselling is presented as a form of patient education. As attention to the role of sleep hygiene in promoting public health has grown, there has been an increase in the number of resources available in print and on the internet. Organizations running public health initiatives include the National Sleep Foundation and the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, both of which have created public websites with sleep hygiene resources, such as tips for sleep hygiene, instructional videos, sleep hygiene self-assessments, poll statistics on sleep hygiene, and tools to find sleep professionals. A cooperative agreement between the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine was established in 2013 to coordinate the National Healthy Sleep Awareness Project, with one of their aims being to promote sleep hygiene awareness. ==History== While the term sleep hygiene was first introduced in 1939 by Nathaniel Kleitman, a book published in 1977 by psychologist Peter Hauri introduced the concept within the context of modern sleep medicine.de Biase et al. Sleep Hygiene. Chapter 27 in Sleepiness and human impact assessment. Eds. Garborino LN et al. Springer Milan, 2014. In this book Hauri outlined a list of behavioral rules intended to promote improved sleep. Similar concepts are credited to Paolo Mantegazza who published a related original book in 1864. The 1990 publication of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) introduced the diagnostic category Inadequate Sleep Hygiene. Inadequate sleep hygiene was a subclassification of Chronic Insomnia Disorder in the ICSD-II published in 2005; it was removed from the 2014 ICSD-III along with two other classifications, because \\"they were not felt to be reliably reproducible in clinical practice.\\"Bonnet MH, Arand DL.

For example, advice to simply avoid sleeping pills was included in early sets of recommendations, but as more drugs to help with sleep have been introduced, recommendations concerning their use have become more complex. ==See also== * Chronotype * Circadian rhythm * Dark therapy ==References== ==External links== * Healthy Sleep Category:Sleep Category:Self-care Category:Hygiene ","title":"Sleep hygiene"},{"id":"1268984","text":"The Chronicle Herald is a broadsheet newspaper published in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada owned by Sarah Dennis of Halifax. The largest newspaper company in Nova Scotia and the largest independently owned newspaper company in Canada, The Chronicle Herald was also the highest circulation newspaper in the Atlantic provinces until recently. The newspaper has lost ground to online competitors as well as the free daily StarMetro Halifax (formerly Metro Halifax), which recently became the most-read newspaper in Halifax according to 20152016 readership figures. The paper's newsroom staff were locked out of work from January 2016 until August 2017. Herald management continued to publish using strikebreaker labour, and were accused by the union of refusing to bargain in good faith with the intention of union busting. ==History== Billboard on the former Herald Building in downtown Halifax, 2007 ===Early years=== Founded in 1874 as The Morning Herald, the paper quickly became one of Halifax's main newspapers. The same company also owned the Evening Mail, which was published in the afternoon. Its main competitors were the Chronicle in the morning, and the Star in the afternoon. By 1949 the papers had merged to become The Chronicle-Herald and Mail-Star respectively. ===Graham Dennis era=== Graham W. Dennis took over as publisher of the newspaper in 1954, at age 26, after the death of his father, senator William Henry Dennis, who in turn had succeeded senator William Dennis in running the paper. He led the newspaper for the next half century. Dennis was proud of the paper's independence and rebuffed numerous offers to buy it. He was known as a humanistic employer interested in the welfare of his employees, stating that his proudest moment was the introduction of a pension plan for Herald staff. He had a reputation as an \\"old-school media baron\\" who set up bureaus across Canada and even one in London, England. Dennis considered the paper essential to effecting positive change in Nova Scotia and ensured that it was available across the province. In 1998 the company began producing a Sunday edition called The Sunday Herald, which ran until April 20, 2013. In 2004 The Chronicle-Herald and Mail-Star were merged to form the single The Chronicle Herald. In January 2004, The Chronicle Herald became the first newspaper in Canada, and one of only several in the world, to operate a WIFAG offset press. This development led to an increased use of colour, and changes in font and styling. In 2002 the historic Herald headquarters on Argyle Street was listed for sale for $15 million and sold by the Dennis family to the cable TV mogul Charles Keating. Keating died in 2005. In 2007 Argyle Developments Ltd. purchased the property from his estate. The Chronicle Herald moved in 2008 to one of the buildings on the ex-Maritime Life campus in Armdale. The former Herald buildings were demolished and the site was redeveloped as the Nova Centre, which houses the new Halifax Convention Centre. Armdale. In October 2008, The Chronicle Herald was named one of \\"Canada's Top 100 Employers\\" by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in Maclean's newsmagazine. On February 3, 2009, the paper laid off 24 employees, the first layoffs in the paper's 136-year history. The cuts represented approximately one quarter of its newsroom staff, but it remained the largest newsroom east of Montreal. These cuts impacted the production department where nine employees were laid off. The company stated that these layoffs were the result of a decline in advertising due to the distress of the current economic situation. In 2014, the Herald issued layoff notices to another 20 newsroom employees. ===New management=== Sarah Dennis, daughter of owner Graham Dennis and vice-president since the 1990s, took over as CEO of the newspaper in November 2010. She married Mark Lever in August 2011. Graham Dennis, who ran the newspaper for more than 57 years, died on December 1, 2011 at the age of 84. Sarah Dennis inherited the paper. Lever took over as president and CEO in 2012. Though the newspaper is profitable, Dennis and Lever have aggressively cut costs in recent years. Dennis holds a \\"far less romantic view of the newspaper\\" than her father did, a characteristic that journalist Stephen Kimber said has made cost-cutting easy. Dennis stated: \\"It's a business, and you have to run it like a business. The history is important, but you can't let that determine what you do.\\" Shortly after taking over as CEO, Dennis championed the newspaper's independence, stating: \\"The fact that we‚Äôre not controlled by someone in Ontario makes a big difference in what we can do.\\" She stated that the newspaper would remain independent as long as possible. However, following her father's death Dennis stated that she would entertain offers from potential buyers. Discord erupted in 2011 after the Herald wrote a new contract for freelance journalists that gave the newspaper rights to freelancers' work forever, without any payment for signing over the copyright. Numerous freelancers, including Ralph Surette and Silver Donald Cameron, refused to sign. Dennis stated that the newspaper was simply emulating what other newspapers across the country were doing. The newspaper purchased Bounty Print, a commercial printing company, in 2011. In 2012 they purchased The Casket, a weekly newspaper published in Antigonish, through a Herald sister company, Brace Publishing Limited. The company also launched the glossy Herald Magazine in February 2012. It launched the Cape Breton Star, a weekly newspaper, in Cape Breton in May 2014. Circulation has been in decline. In 2012 the Audit Bureau of Circulations reported circulation of 108,389 weekdays, 112,306 Saturdays and 97,190 SundaysAudit Bureau of Circulations e-Circ data for the six months ending September 30, 2011. Retrieved February 16, 2012. In April 2012 the Sunday edition was discontinued as a cost-cutting measure and the Saturday paper was renamed Weekend. Still, in 2013, Sarah Dennis stated that the newspaper was profitable and that readership was at an all-time high. In September 2014, weekday circulation was estimated at 70,000, with the weekend edition selling 72,000. On-line subscriptions totaled 1,862.Reported in AllNovaScotia.com, May 1, 2015, citing an Audited Media report In February 2015, the Herald locked out its 13 unionized printing press workers, causing the first work stoppage in the company's history. The lockout ended about a month later, after the union agreed to major concessions. ==2016‚Äì17 labour dispute== ===Lockout and bargaining=== On January 23, 2016, 61 members of the Halifax Typographical Union's newsroom and news bureau staff were locked out of the Herald by Dennis and Lever, who went on to hire \\"scab\\" reporters as replacements. The Chronicle Herald refused any concessions offered by the union, and later on the striking staff launched a competing online newspaper called Local Xpress. By September 2016, the number of striking workers was down to 56 as some had sought new employment for financial reasons. The union criticized the Herald for spending more than $400,000 on security (as at September 2016) while demanding cuts in the newsroom, and stated that the real intention of management was to bust the union. The typographical union also accused Sarah Dennis of hiring private investigators to tail and intimidate picketers. In September 2016 the Herald announced that it was shutting down the Cape Breton Star due to \\"a prevailing headwind of union sympathy in industrial Cape Breton\\". The union agreed to wage cuts and increased working hours equating to an hourly pay decrease of 17 per cent, layoffs of a third of unionized staff, a cap on severance pay, reductions in vacation time and mileage allowance, a 25 per cent lower starting wage, and elimination of the defined benefit pension plan founded by Graham Dennis. However, the dispute dragged on with no agreement being reached between the two parties. The newspaper was accused of making unreasonable demands with the aim of breaking the union, and hired lawyers advertising services in union-busting. During a round of bargaining in October 2016, Herald made numerous additional demands, including further cuts to the union's bargaining power, reduced sick leave pay, a further four per cent wage cut, eight more layoffs (amounting to a total of 26 layoffs), and the closure of Local Xpress and the signing-over of all Local Xpress content to the Herald. In November 2016 the union filed a complaint with the Nova Scotia Labour Board accusing the Herald management of \\"bargaining in a manner designed to end union representation\\", preventing an agreement from being reached. As a result of this strike, CEO Mark Lever won rankandfile.ca's annual Scumbag of the Year award for 2016. It was the second time in three years a Nova Scotian won this award. ===Strikebreakers and quality issues=== Throughout the strike, the Halifax Typographical Union used social media to draw light to typographical and factual errors that plagued the paper since the strike began, and alleged that these quality issues were a result of using inexperienced \\"scab\\" staff. In addition, the union and others lambasted the strikebreakers for questionable journalistic practices. The use of strikebreakers is banned in many countries, but Quebec is the only jurisdiction within Canada that outlaws the practice. Several faculty members at the University of King's College, which is well-regarded for its journalism program, advised graduating students against crossing the picket line. The Herald approached several King's students and were rebuffed. Investigative journalist Tim Bousquet, of the Halifax Examiner, questioned the newspaper's practice of printing advertorial content nearly indistinguishable from regular news. Similarly, the union pointed out instances of the \\"scab Herald\\" reprinting press releases nearly verbatim. Of the quality of the newspaper during the strike, Bousquet wrote: \\"Without the professional journalists, the paper is crap [...] The Herald has zero credibility. And the complete abandonment of any journalistic standards is showing in spades.\\" Alex Boutilier of the Toronto Star spoke out after the Herald reprinted one of his articles and attributed it to his name only, with no mention of the Star, making it appear as though he was writing as a strikebreaker. Boutilier stated that he could not find the piece on The Canadian Press news wire while Bousquet commented that aside from the Star, the Herald appears to have been the only other newspaper to print the story. The Herald subsequently removed his byline from the online edition. ===Chebucto Heights controversy=== Controversy surrounding an article published 8 April 2016 online (appearing in print on 9 April) made national headlines. The story alleged that Syrian refugee children attending Chebucto Heights Elementary School were \\"choking, pushing, slapping and verbally abusing their fellow classmates\\". The paper was widely condemned as the story was unverified, having been based on a sole anonymous source, and was written with a highly sensational tone that alleged acts of \\"brutality\\" by children as young as five. It was published anonymously, lacking any byline, and was picked up by right-wing media abroad to bolster anti-refugee sentiment. The superintendent of the Halifax Regional School Board, Elwin LeRoux, stated that he was \\"deeply offended to see the school represented so inaccurately\\". LeRoux stated that the school board had investigated the allegations and had come up empty-handed. In the face of public outcry the newspaper tweaked the article online, removing some details before deleting it from the Herald website altogether on Monday morning. The paper published an editor's note that admitted the story \\"needed more work\\". In the wake of the controversy award- winning non-union columnist Lezlie Lowe quit the newspaper in protest, stating in her farewell column that \\"The story lays bare the worst of the worst xenophobia in our city and our province. It lacks all proportion. Balance eludes it, start to finish.\\" === Regional expansion === On 13 April 2017, Transcontinental announced that it had sold all of its newspapers in Atlantic Canada to SaltWire Network, a newly formed parent company of the Herald. The Halifax Typographical Union called the purchase evidence that the Herald's claim of impending financial collapse was a \\"total fabrication\\". The president of CWA Canada also weighed in, stating of the ongoing labour dispute: \\"This has never been about money. It has been about power and union busting.\\" === Government inquiry and conclusion=== On 13 July 2017, the Department of Labour and Advanced Education announced that it was setting up an Industrial Inquiry Commission, under the provisions of the province's Trade Union Act, to force mediation between the union and the Herald management from 4 August 2017. A union spokesperson called the move \\"long overdue\\" while the Herald's chief operating officer called the announcement \\"puzzling\\". The dispute finally ended in August 2017 when the union voted to ratify a new eight-year deal. The agreement included an increase in the work week from 35 to 37.5 hours, the dismissal of 26 union staff (with 25 returning to the newspaper and one moving to Cape Breton), and wage cuts. == Circulation == The Chronicle Herald has seen like most Canadian daily newspapers a decline in circulation.

GAA is analogous to a baseball pitcher's earned run average (ERA). In Japanese, the same translation (Èò≤Âæ°Áéá) is used for both GAA and ERA, because of this. For ice hockey, the goals against average statistic is the number of goals a goaltender allows per 60 minutes of playing time. It is calculated by taking the number of goals against, multiply that by 60 (minutes) and then dividing by the number of minutes played. The current modification is used by the NHL since 1965 & the IIHF since 1990. When calculating GAA, overtime goals and time on ice are included, whereas empty net and shootout goals are not. It is typically given to two decimal places. The top goaltenders in the National Hockey League currently have a GAA of about 1.85-2.10, although the measure of a good GAA changes as different playing styles come and go. The top goaltenders in the National Lacrosse League however, currently have a GAA of about 10.00, and the top 2005 Western Lacrosse Association goaltenders had a GAA of about 9.00. At their best, elite NCAA water polo goalies have a GAA between 3.00 and 5.00. Since the statistic is highly dependent on the team playing in front of a goalie, save percentage is usually considered a more accurate measure of a goaltender's skill, especially in ice hockey and lacrosse, as it takes into account the number of shots the goaltender has faced. In soccer, since it is considered a part of the goalkeeper's job to coach defenders on proper positioning to prevent opponents' shots, GAA is more commonly used to evaluate goalkeepers than save percentage. ==References== ==External links== Category:Ice hockey statistics ","title":"Goals against average"},{"id":"1268992","text":"The Durham Wasps were an ice hockey team located in Durham and was one of England's most well-known names in ice hockey. The team was bought by Sir John Hall and moved to the neighbouring city of Newcastle Upon Tyne in August 1996. The Newcastle team, after several changes became known as the Newcastle Jesters. ==The History of the Wasps== The Durham Wasps began their prosperous start to hockey just after the war, and were started by Michael Davey of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, along with a few other Canadians, who after the war made their homes in Durham. Ice hockey remained popular in the sixties and seventies, but it exploded with popularity between the eighties and nineties, and the period from around 1982 to 1992 was one to remember for the Wasps. In this period alone they won the Heineken Championship four times, the league championship six times, the Norwich Cup three times, and other trophies like the Autumn and Castle Eden Cups on many other occasions. The Durham Wasps dominated the British League for over 10 years. There was an intense local rivalry with both the Whitley Warriors and the Billingham Bombers. It was a golden period for hockey in the North East with derby matches against the Warriors often resulting in crowds which exceeded the stated capacity of the rink by a considerable margin. With the rise of teams such as the Cardiff Devils and Sheffield Steelers, the Wasps started to struggle to fund a competitive team. At the same time, the rink was in need of significant investment. Around this time, John Hall, then owner of Newcastle United Football Club, laid plans to form a centre of sporting excellence in Newcastle. As part of this he purchased the team with the intention of moving them to a new ice rink in Newcastle. In the meanwhile, the team temporarily played out of the Crowtree Leisure Centre in Sunderland. This proved very divisive amongst Wasps fans with many to this day refusing to watch ice hockey in Newcastle. A replacement team was established in Durham called the Durham City Wasps who played in the English League. This featured some players who the new Wasps owners decided not to retain, as well as players from the junior teams. Unfortunately the team only lasted one season before the costs of maintaining the rink came to a head and the rink was sold to be redeveloped. The plans for a new rink in Newcastle came to nothing so a deal was made which resulted in the Whitley Warriors being evicted from the Telewest Arena to make way for the team. After a season of playing out of Crowtree, Wasps were taken to Newcastle and renamed the Newcastle Cobras. In the next few years they changed owners and names from the Cobras, to the Riverkings, to the Jesters, however, the franchise folded soon after. A new unrelated team, the Newcastle Vipers were founded in 2002 to keep the city's ice hockey heritage alive, but due to low crowds and problems getting regular ice time at the Arena, in November 2010 the Vipers were forced to move in with the 'old enemy' and play for part of their final season out of the Hillheads rink in Whitley Bay. It proved impossible to keep the team going and the 2010/11 season was the last featuring a Newcastle team. ==Revival Games== Originally a one-off game, former Durham Wasps players from the 80s and 90s reformed to play former local rivals Whitley Warriors on 4 May 2008 at Whitley Bay Ice Rink, commemorating the 60th anniversary of the formation of the club, and in support of the ongoing campaign to bring back an ice rink. Over 2,300 fans turned up to witness this encounter which saw Wasps players icing once again including the Johnson brothers, Mario Belanger, Ivor Bennett, Stephen Foster, John Hutley and Karl Walker. The reformed Wasps team won the game 8‚Äì4. A second 'Legends' game was played with Whitley Warriors, Sunday 6 May 2012, again at Whitley Bay, and in memory of former Durham Wasps manager Kenny Swinburne. The Wasps won 5‚Äì2 with Mario Belanger scoring within 30 seconds in the first period. ==Honours== Heineken Premier League Champions *1985, 1986, 1989, 1991, 1992 Heineken British Championship Winners *1987, 1988, 1991, 1992 Autumn Cup Winners *1984, 1988, 1989, 1991 Castle Eden Cup Winners *1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995. ==External links== *Videos of Durham Wasps YouTube Category:Ice hockey teams in England Category:Sport in Durham, England Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 1947 Category:Sports clubs disestablished in 1996 ","title":"Durham Wasps"},{"id":"1268993","text":"Unicase and cased glottal-stop letters The character , called glottal stop, is an alphabetic letter in some Latin alphabets, most notable in several languages of Canada where it indicates a glottal stop sound.

A shot that is deflected wide or blocked by an opponent does not count as a shot on goal; it is recorded as a blocked shot. The player who blocks the shot is credited with a 'blocked shot', and the player who shoots the puck is credited with an 'attempt blocked'. Shots that sail wide or high of the net, and shots that hit the goalpost or crossbar, are not counted as shots on goal; they are counted as 'missed shots'. Additionally, if a goaltender stops a puck that is going wide or high anyway, it is recorded as a 'missed shot'. Since it is not counted as a shot on goal, the goaltender does not get credit for a save. An attempted shot that hits the pipe framing the goal mouth is not counted as a shot on goal, unless the puck goes into the goal without further contact from the team attempting the shot. A puck that is not shot with the intention of scoring (dump in, deflected pass), and ends up stopped by the goalie, should not be counted as a shot on goal. ==Shots on net== A shot on net is any touch of the puck towards the net, that if not for the goaltender intervening, would result in a goal. Blocked shots don't count. If someone shoots the puck and it's tipped, only the \\"tip\\" counts as a shot, and the original shot becomes a \\"pass\\". If a clearing attempt from the other team ends up on net it should be a shot on goal. If someone swats at a rebound and sends it toward the net it should be a shot on goal. Clearing attempts that end up on net should most definitely count and most scorers will count them. In the case of a partially blocked shot, or a tipped shot that was on net and is tipped off net, these are not supposed to be counted as shots on goal, as only the \\"final\\" touch is a \\"shot\\" and the final touch sent those pucks wide. Wrap arounds and stuff attempts can be an issue. If the goalie's pad blocks a wrap around before he gets around far enough, then the puck would go \\"across\\" the crease instead of into the net. Therefore, it shouldn't be regarded as a shot on goal.

Spin labels are normally used as tools for probing proteins or biological membrane-local dynamics using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) technique allows one to monitor a specific region within a protein. In protein structure examinations, amino acid-specific SLs can be used. The goal of spin labeling is somewhat similar to that of isotopic substitution in NMR spectroscopy. There one replaces an atom lacking a nuclear spin (and so is NMR-silent) with an isotope having a spin I eq 0 (and so is NMR-active). This technique is useful for tracking the chemical environment around an atom when full substitution with an NMR-active isotope is not feasible. Recently, spin- labelling has also been used to probe chemical local environment in NMR itself, in a technique known as Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement (PRE). Recent developments in the theory and experimental measurement of PREs have enabled the detection, characterization and visualization of sparsely populated states of proteins and their complexes. Such states, which are invisible to conventional biophysical and structural techniques, play a key role in many biological processes including molecular recognition, allostery, macromolecular assembly and aggregation. ==Applications of spin EPR== Spin labelled fatty acids have been extensively used to understand dynamic organization of lipids in bio-membranes and membrane biophysics. For example, stearic acid labelled with nitroxyl spin label moiety at various carbons (5,7,9,12,13,14 and 16th) with respect to first carbon of carbonyl group have been used to study the flexibility gradient of membrane lipids to understand membrane fluidity conditions at different depths of their lipid bilayer organization. ==References== *Berliner, L.J.

He studied at the University of Edinburgh, where he gained a Ph.D. in Chemistry (1957). He was most famous for his controversial 1985 book Seven Clues to the Origin of Life. The book popularized a hypothesis he began to develop in the mid-1960s‚Äîthat self-replication of clay crystals in solution might provide a simple intermediate step between biologically inert matter and organic life. He inspired other ideas about chemical evolution, including the Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment and the RNA World, all of which are hypotheses that have played important roles in attempts to understand the origin of life. Cairns-Smith also published on the evolution of consciousness, in Evolving the Mind (1996), favoring a role for quantum mechanics in human thought. He died on 26 August 2016.CAIRNS SMITH. ==Clay hypothesis== The clay hypothesis suggests how biologically inert matter helped the evolution of early life forms: clay minerals form naturally from silicates in solution. Clay crystals, as other crystals, preserve their external formal arrangement as they grow, snap, and grow further. Clay crystal masses of a particular external form may happen to affect their environment in ways that affect their chances of further replication. For example, a \\"stickier\\" clay crystal is more likely to silt a stream bed, creating an environment conducive to further sedimentation. It is conceivable that such effects could extend to the creation of flat areas likely to be exposed to air, dry, and turn to wind-borne dust, which could fall randomly in other streams. Thus‚Äîby simple, inorganic, physical processes‚Äîa selection environment might exist for the reproduction of clay crystals of the \\"stickier\\" shape. There follows a process of natural selection for clay crystals that trap certain forms of molecules to their surfaces that may enhance their replication potential. Complex proto-organic molecules can be catalysed by the surface properties of silicates. When complex molecules perform a \\"genetic takeover\\" from their clay \\"vehicle\\", they become an independent locus of replication ‚Äì an evolutionary moment that might be understood as the first exaptation. ==Selected publications== * .

It has been translated into English, Korean, and Chinese. In this fantasy game, the player takes role of a war hero who raises a girl to the age of 18. At the end of the game, the daughter goes into a line of work; what this work is, how much talent she has for it, her marital life, and her overall happiness all depend on the player's actions. ==Gameplay== English version screenshot The game takes place in a fantasy world roughly modelled after medieval Europe. The starting year is given as 1210 K.D. The player's character is a famous warrior who defended the kingdom from an invasion by Lucifon, the Prince of Darkness (a corruption of Lucifer); consequently, he is known throughout the land as a military hero and receives an annual salary from the palace. One night, he receives a communication from a god whose identity is determined by the birthdate the player selects at the beginning of the game. This god bestows upon the mentioned player a child of the heavens, and it is their duty to raise her from the age of 10 to the age of 18, at which point she will enter a line of work; the most desirable outcome is that of a royal princess. The daughter has a set of statistics that fluctuate depending on the activities the player assigns to her schedule, including various part-time jobs, schooling, adventure, and free time. It is these statistics that ultimately determine her final occupation, her skill level in her line of work, and her overall happiness in life; her marital fate is also decided, in part, by these statistics. The game also makes use of some invisible statistics to determine the occurrence of certain special events. The god who visits the father is the daughter's patron god. That patron determines her starting statistics in a way that is loosely related to the god's role in the Roman pantheon; for example, a girl born under Mars begins the game with an advantage in fighting reputation. The game features 74 possible endings. ==Reception== Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"This is the strangest game to hit the U.S. PC market in years, and on a certain level, Ignite should be commended for taking the chance to release it. Whether it can, or maybe even should, find an audience is another matter.\\" ==Legend of Another World== The SNES version of the game, which features a new cast of characters. The daughter does not have a default name, but is named Melody Blue in o Go! Go! Princess, and the player's butler's name is Raphael. The combat and adventure systems are redesigned. In combat, the daughter's actions are now determined by cards that are played during battle, along with the stats built up through schooling and jobs. ==Refine Edition== Along with the original Princess Maker 1, Princess Maker 2 has received a newer \\"refined\\" remake for Windows. The overall graphics and sound quality of the game have been improved, along with various other elements. An English-language version of Princess Maker 2 Refine was released via Steam in Fall 2016. == References == ==External links== *Princess Maker 2 at MobyGames *Story of the failed English translation ===Japanese=== * * Category:1993 video games Category:DOS games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Raising sims Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games featuring non-playable protagonists Category:TurboGrafx-CD games Category:FM Towns games Category:NEC PC-9801 games Category:Windows games ","title":"Princess Maker 2"},{"id":"1269035","text":"The Tonnele Circle is an intersection in Jersey City, New Jersey, United States. It is named after Tonnele [\\"TON-lee\\"] Avenue, the north‚Äìsouth road that runs through it. Entrances and exits are, listed clockwise from north: *Tonnele Avenue north (U.S. Route 1/9) *entrance from Route 139 and Kennedy Boulevard *exit to Route 139 *Tonnele Avenue south *entrance from Pulaski Skyway (U.S. Route 1/9) *Truck US 1/9 *exit to Pulaski Skyway (U.S. Route 1/9) ==History== A pre-2010 picture of the underside of the Pulaski Skyway at Tonnele Circle, with the Tonnele Circle Viaduct (added in 1938, now demolished) on the left. New Tonnele Circle bypass, 2013 Before the Pulaski Skyway was built, the cut through the New Jersey Palisades (now Route 139) ended at Tonnele Circle, where Tonnele Avenue went north and south, and the main road to Newark went west. To the east, just north of the road through the cut, was a connector road to Hudson County Boulevard (now renamed Kennedy Boulevard). When the Skyway was built, the old connection to Tonnele Circle became a left-side exit and entrance ramp to the Circle, with the Skyway passing over the Circle. Right-side exit and entrance ramps were provided between the Skyway and the Circle, with the southbound onramp exiting the circle north of the old road (now TRUCK US 1/9). On September 14, 1938, a direct ramp, known as the Tonnele Circle Viaduct, opened from the cut, passing over Tonnele Circle, to TRUCK US 1/9. This greatly improved traffic, since southbound (westbound) trucks no longer had to pass through the circle. Northbound (eastbound) trucks still do, but they only cross the Tonnelle Avenue south approach, which is relatively minor. A pre-2010 picture of the Tonnele Circle from the air. Its original shape is still visible beneath the Pulaski Skyway and the modifications of 1938 and 1952. In mid-1952, Tonnele Circle was rebuilt. Northbound traffic from TRUCK US 1/9 could now go straight through the circle. Also at that time, or possibly earlier, the offramp from Route 139 was moved to the right side, and entered the Circle where the connector to Hudson County Boulevard had. The connector was modified to only go towards the Circle. The Tonnele Circle was adjusted again in 2005. A ramp was added to permit vehicles heading southbound on Tonnele Avenue to access the Pulaski Skyway without entering the circle. Additionally, ramps around and through the circle were modified to improve traffic flow, and traffic lights were added and recalibrated to reduce the chances of cross traffic being in an intersection simultaneously. In 2011, the New Jersey Department of Transportation completed a new approach route and began to demolish the original U.S. Route 1/9 Truck St. Paul's Viaduct and the Tonnele Circle Viaduct, deemed ‚Äústructurally deficient and functionally obsolete‚Äù. Southbound traffic was routed to the new viaduct on February of that year, with northbound traffic being routed to the new viaduct in September of that year. ==Naming== It is sometimes believed that the circle (and street) gets its name from the Holland Tunnel, since the circle was built for the tunnel. Hagstrom maps even label the circle as Tunnel's Traffic Circle. However, the circle was named after the street, and the street was probably named after a John Tonnele, who died in 1852, or one of his descendants. Information on the Tonnele family is sparse, but at least some of them lived in Jersey City, where the street now runs. The street was named by 1883. There is some confusion about the spelling - whether the name has one 'L' or two - even within Jersey City, and street signs reflect both options. However, the U.S. Postal Service favors \\"Tonnele,\\" which reflects the spelling of the man after whom the street is named.

Organisms that originate from contaminated areas may already be able to break down waste, but perhaps inefficiently and slowly. Bioaugmentation is a type of bioremediation in which it requires studying the indigenous varieties present in the location to determine if biostimulation is possible. After discovering the indigenous bacteria found in the location, if the indigenous bacteria can metabolize the contaminants, more of the indigenous bacterial cultures will be implemented into the location to boost the degradation of the contaminants. Bioaugmentation is the introduction of more archaea or bacterial cultures to enhance the contaminant degradation whereas biostimulation is the addition of nutritional supplements for the indigenous bacteria to promote the bacterial metabolism. If the indigenous variety do not have the metabolic capability to perform the remediation process, exogenous varieties with such sophisticated pathways are introduced. The utilization of bioaugmentation provides advancement in the fields of microbial ecology and biology, immobilization, and bioreactor design. Bioaugmentation is commonly used in municipal wastewater treatment to restart activated sludge bioreactors. Most cultures available contain microbial cultures, already containing all necessary microorganisms (B. licheniformis, B. thuringiensis, P. polymyxa, B. stearothermophilus, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., Flavobacterium, Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Saccharomyces, etc.). Activated sludge systems are generally based on microorganisms like bacteria, protozoa, nematodes, rotifers, and fungi, which are capable of degrading biodegradable organic matter. There are many positive outcomes from the use of bioaugmentation, such as the improvement in efficiency and speed of the process of breaking down substances and the reduction of toxic particles in an area.Huban, C.M. [Betz-Dearborn Inc., and R.D. [Sybron Chemicals Plowman, \\"Bioaugmentation: Put Microbes to Work.‚Äù Chemical Engineering 104.3\\", (1997): n. pag. Print. == Applications == ===Soil remediation=== Bioaugmentation is favorable in contaminated soils that have undergone bioremediation, but still pose an environmental risk. This is because microorganisms that were originally in the environment did not accomplish their task during bioremediation when it came to breaking down chemicals in the contaminated soil. The failure of original bacteria can be caused by environmental stresses, as well as changes in the microbial population due to mutation rates. When microorganisms are added, they are potentially more suited to the nature of the new contaminant, meanwhile the older microorganisms are similar to the older pollution and contamination. However, this is merely one of many factors; site size is also a very important determinant. In order to see whether bioaugmentation should be implemented, the overall setting must be considered. Also, some highly specialized microorganisms are not capable of adapting to certain site settings. Availability of certain microorganism types (as used for bioremediation) may also be a problem. Although bioaugmentation may appear to be a perfect solution for contaminated soil, it can have drawbacks. For example, the wrong type of bacteria can result in potentially clogged aquifers, or the remediation result may be incomplete or unsatisfactory. ===Bioaugmentation of chlorinated solvents=== At sites where soil and groundwater are contaminated with chlorinated ethenes, such as tetrachloroethylene and trichloroethylene, bioaugmentation can be used to ensure that the in situ microorganisms can completely degrade these contaminants to ethylene and chloride, which are non-toxic. Bioaugmentation is typically only applicable to bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes, although there are emerging cultures with the potential to biodegrade other compounds including BTEX, chloroethanes, chloromethanes, and MTBE. The first reported application of bioaugmentation for chlorinated ethenes was at Kelly Air Force Base, TX. Bioaugmentation is typically performed in conjunction with the addition of electron donor (biostimulation) to achieve geochemical conditions in groundwater that favor the growth of the dechlorinating microorganisms in the bioaugmentation culture. ===Niche fitness=== Including more microbes into an environment is beneficial to the speed of the cleanup duration. The interaction and competitions of two compounds influence the performance that a microorganism, original or new, could have. This can be tested by placing a soil that favors the new microbes into the area and then looking at the performance. The results will show if the new microorganism can perform well enough in that soil with other microorganisms. This helps to determine the correct amount of microbes and indigenous substances that are needed in order to optimize performance and create a co-metabolism. ===Coke plant wastewater in China=== An example of how bioaugmentation has improved an environment, is in the coke plant wastewater in China. Coal in China is used as a main energy source and the contaminated water contains harmful toxic contaminants like ammonia, thiocyanate, phenols and other organic compounds, such as mono- and polycyclic nitrogen-containing aromatics, oxygen and sulfur-containing heterocyclics and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. Previous measures to treat this problem was an aerobic-anoxic-oxic system, solvent extractions, stream stripping, and biological treatment. Bioaugmentation has been reported to remove 3-chlorobenzoate, 4-methyl benzoate, toluene, phenol, and chlorinated solvents. The anaerobic reactor was packed with semi-soft media, which were constructed by plastic ring and synthetic fiber string. The anoxic reactor is a completely mixed reactor while the oxic reactor is a hybrid bioreactor in which polyurethane foam carriers were added. Water from anoxic reactor, odic reactor and sedimentation tank were used and had mix-ins of different amount of old and developed microbes with .75 concentration and 28 degree Celsius. The rate of contaminant degradation depended on the amount of microbe concentration. In the enhanced microbial community indigenous microorganisms broke down the contaminants in the coke plant wastewater, such as pyridines, and phenolic compounds. When indigenous heterotrophic microorganisms were added, they converted many large molecular compounds into smaller and simpler compounds, which could be taken from more biodegradable organic compounds. This proves that bioaugmentation could be used as a tool for the removal of unwanted compounds that are not properly removed by conventional biological treatment system. When bioaugmentation is combined with A1‚ÄìA2‚ÄìO system for the treatment of coke plant wastewater it is very powerful. ===Petroleum cleanup=== In the petroleum industry, there is a large problem with how oilfield drilling pit is disposed of. Many used to simply place dirt over the pit, but it is far more productive and economically beneficial to use bioaugmentation. With the use of advanced microbes, drilling companies can actually treat the problem in the oilfield pit instead of transferring the waste around. Specifically, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be metabolized by some bacteria, which significantly reduces environmental damage from drilling activities. Given suitable environmental conditions, microbes are placed in the oilpit to break down hydrocarbons and alongside are other nutrients. Before treatment there was a total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) level of 44,880 ppm, which within just 47 days the TPH was lowered to a level of 10,000 ppm to 6,486 ppm.Barber, T. P., \\"Bioaugmentation for the treatment of oilfield drilling waste.\\", PennWell Conferences and Exhibitions, Houston, TX (United States), 1997 ==Failures and potential solutions== There have been many instances where bioaugmentation had deficiencies in its process. The implementation of bioaugmentation on the environment can pose problems of predation, nutritional competition between indigenous and inoculated bacteria, insufficient inoculations, and disturbing the ecological balance due to large inoculations. Each problem can be solved using different techniques to limit the possibilities of these problems occurring. Predation can be prevented by high initial doses of the inoculated bacteria or heat treatment prior to inoculation whereas nutritional competition can be settled with biostimulation. Insufficient inoculations can be treated by repeated or continual inoculations and large inoculations are resolved with highly monitored dosages of the bacteria. Examples include the introduced bacteria fail to enhance the degradation within the soil, and the bioaugmentation trials fail on the laboratory scale, but succeed on the large scale. Many of these problems occurred because the microbial ecology issues were not taken into consideration in order to map the performance of the bioaugmentation. It is crucial to consider the microbes' ability to withstand the conditions in the microbial community to be placed in. In many of the cases that have failed, only the microbes' ability to break down compounds was considered and less their fitness in existing communities and the resulting competitive stress. It is better to identify the existing communities before looking at the strains needed to break down pollutants. ==See also== *biotransformation *Syntrophomonas zehnderi *Dehalococcoidetes ==References== Category:Microbiology Category:Bioremediation ","title":"Bioaugmentation"},{"id":"1269056","text":"Harry Lee (August 27, 1932 - October 1, 2007) was the long-time sheriff of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.

Borne, Jr. and was re-elected six times, having served twenty-eight years and six months. He is the older brother of Playboy magazine's first Asian-American centerfold, China Lee. ==Gambling== Lee defended gambling and claimed abuses were no more severe that those with addictions to alcohol and tobacco. He earmarked gambling revenues for jail buildings and maintenance. Without video poker, Lee said that Jefferson Parish would lose nearly $4 million annually in public revenues.\\"Lee to spend taxpayer money to promote video poker\\", Minden Press-Herald, October 1, 1996, p. 1. ==Political career== Harry Lee was elected sheriff in 1979, having defeated long-time incumbent Alwynn Cronvich. He was re-elected every four years from 1983 through 2003. In 1987, Lee faced a strong election challenge from Republican Art Lentini (later a state senator), and he was forced into a general election, but he managed to win by 54-46 percent. He was re-elected with no significant opposition in subsequent elections, and he remained a political celebrity within Jefferson Parish. He was credited with keeping the crime rate low for the past twenty- five years, while the rate in neighboring Orleans Parish remains one of the highest in the nation. In 1989, Lee deplored the choice of David Duke and John S. Treen standing as Republicans for the vacancy in state House District 81 created by the resignation of Charles Cusimano, who became a state court judge. To Lee, the showdown in the special election was a choice between \\"a bigot and an asshole.\\"Ron Gomez, My Name is Ron and I'm a Recovering Legislator: Memoirs of a Louisiana State Representative, Lafayette, Louisiana: Zemog Publishing, 2000, p. 223, A Democrat, Lee ran for governor in 1995 but dropped out before the primary. He famously said, \\"why would I want to be governor when I can be king?\\" Lee endorsed Mike Foster, a Republican who came from behind in the polls to win the governorship and to serve two terms.

He also gained a reputation as an anti-corruption reformer while serving as the Parish Attorney for Jefferson Parish. Lee was a political insider in Louisiana, and had close personal contacts with former Governor Edwards and the Boggs family in New Orleans. He often made controversial statements to the local media. He showed unwavering loyalty to his deputies during allegations of police brutality in Jefferson Parish. He had also shown support for other Louisiana politicians during several federal investigations of government corruption, including the investigation and eventual conviction of Edwards. Many of these politicians were personal friends of Lee, but Lee himself was never accused of corruption. The family of Harry Lee is affiliated with the Chinese Presbyterian Church in Kenner.

Most memorably, the morning before Katrina hit New Orleans, Lee appeared on emergency radio, with a message for those who had not yet evacuated: \\"You better haul ass! Y'all should have left yesterday.\\" The previous evening, he had let the community know that his birthday party had been cancelled. Lee was one of the few New Orleans politicians to maintain his pre-Katrina popularity. During the storm, Parish President Aaron Broussard evacuated all parish personnel directly under his control to St. Tammany Parish on the Northshore, including the drainage pump operators. This is widely considered the primary cause of flooding on the Eastbank of Jefferson Parish. However, the Sheriff's Office in Jefferson Parish is independent of the Parish President and operates directly under an elected sheriff. When storm conditions dissipated, Jefferson Parish deputies immediately began patrolling all major commercial roads and even individual neighborhoods in the Parish. Most of the Parish at this time had been evacuated, and communications were nearly non-existent. Parish deputies were the only form of security in the Parish in the first week after the storm. Most of the looting that did take place in Jefferson Parish occurred in Terrytown and Gretna, which borders on Algiers and the Crescent City Connection. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office has jurisdiction over all of unincorporated Jefferson Parish, while incorporated cities such as Gretna, Kenner, Harahan and Westwego have their own independent city governments and police departments. In the first week after the storm, Sheriff Lee and Gretna Police Chief Arthur Lawson Jr ordered Gretna police officers and Jefferson Parish deputies to set up a roadblock on the Crescent City Connection and prevent New Orleans evacuees from crossing. This action has been praised by some Gretna residents but criticized by many Orleans Parish elected officials. Harry Lee was named as a co-defendant in the subsequent lawsuits, as he was directly involved in ordering the bridge barricaded. == Death == Lee died five days after returning from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston for his latest round of treatment for leukemia. His death came less than three weeks before he hoped to win an eighth term in office. Lee had qualified to run in the October 20 primary against Harahan Police Chief Peter Dale and contractor Julio Castillo. State law requires qualifying to reopen if a candidate dies before the election is held. On September 30, WWL-TV reported that Lee was hospitalized in serious condition due to complications from leukemia. Lee was reportedly having breathing problems and was taken to the Ochsner Medical Center. He died at 10:44 a.m. on October 1, 2007, and was interred four days later at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans.Daylong farewell to Harry Lee ends with F-15 flyover, gun salute at New Orleans cemetery, Times-Picayune, October 5, 2007Harry Lee, Outspoken Louisiana Sheriff, Dies at 75 Shortly after Lee's death, the primary election for sheriff was moved from October 20 to November 17, and Newell Normand, a Republican, was appointed as the interim sheriff.

When he was seven years old, his mother nursed him through a serious bout of pneumonia and died of the illness herself. His grieving father sent Marlin's two older brothers to private school, and Marlin was sent to his Aunt Laura's farm in Pittsburg, Kansas. He attended public school there through eighth grade. In the fall of 1919, he entered Wentworth Military Academy. There, Perkins demonstrated his fascination with snakes by keeping blue racers in his room. One afternoon, while exercising them on a lawn at the back of the barracks, he was spotted by a faculty officer and got in trouble for handling them. Perkins briefly attended the University of Missouri, but quit school to become a laborer at the Saint Louis Zoological Park. He rose through the ranks, becoming the reptile curator in 1928. After being hired as a curator of the Buffalo Zoological Park in Buffalo, New York, Perkins was eventually promoted to director in 1938. He then served as director at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, Illinois, from 1944 until 1962, when he returned to the St. Louis Zoo, this time as director. During his time at the Lincoln Park Zoo, Perkins joined Sir Edmund Hillary as the zoologist for Hillary's 1960 Himalayan expedition to search for the legendary Yeti. Perkins was the host of Zoo Parade, a television program that originated from the Lincoln Park Zoo on NBC station WNBQ-TV (now WMAQ-TV) when he was the director there. During a rehearsal of Zoo Parade, he was bitten by a timber rattlesnake, one of several bites from venomous snakes Perkins suffered throughout his career (over the years he was also bitten by a cottonmouth and a Gaboon viper). Although the incident occurred during a pre-show rehearsal and was not filmed, it has become something of an urban legend, with many people \\"remembering\\" seeing Perkins receive the bite on television. As a result of his work on Zoo Parade Perkins was offered the job in 1963 for which most North Americans remember him: host of the nature show Wild Kingdom. The fame he gained in his television career allowed him to become an advocate for the protection of endangered species, and through Wild Kingdom he gave many Americans their first exposure to the conservation movement. Perkins also helped establish the Wild Canid Survival and Research Center (WCSRC) near St. Louis in 1971. This wolf sanctuary has been instrumental in breeding wolves for eventual re- placement into their natural habitats. Perkins retired from active zookeeping in 1970 and from Wild Kingdom in 1985 for health reasons. Perkins remained with the Saint Louis Zoo as Director Emeritus until his death on June 14, 1986, when he died of cancer. ==Commemorations== In 1990, Marlin Perkins was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. A statue of Perkins also stands in Central Park in his hometown of Carthage, Missouri. Perkins received an American Education Award in 1974. He was also granted honorary doctoral degrees from the University of Missouri‚ÄîColumbia; Northland College in Ashland, Wisc.; Rockhurst College in Kansas City, Mo.; MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Ill.; and the College of St. Mary in Omaha, Nebr. ==Personal life== He married his first wife, Elise More, in 1933 and their daughter, Suzanne, was born in 1937. Marlin and Elise were married for 20 years and divorced in 1953. He married his wife Carol in 1960; they were married until his death from lymphatic cancer on June 14, 1986. ==References== == Further reading == ==External links== * Marlin Perkins at the Saint Louis Zoo * *Marlin Perkins at the Saint Louis Walk of Fame * Category:1905 births Category:1986 deaths Category:20th-century American scientists Category:20th- century zoologists Category:American zoologists Category:Reptile attack victims Category:Deaths from cancer in Missouri Category:Scientists from Buffalo, New York Category:People from Carthage, Missouri Category:Scientists from St. Louis Category:Saint Louis Zoo people Category:Wentworth Military Academy and College alumni Category:Zookeepers Category:Zoo curators Category:Zoo directors ","title":"Marlin Perkins"},{"id":"1269061","text":"Heinrich Rudolf Hermann Friedrich von Gneist (13 August 1816 ‚Äì 22 July 1895) was a German jurist and politician. Born in Berlin, he was the son of a judge attached to the city's Kammergericht (Court of Appeal). Gneist made significant influence on his student Max Weber and also contributed to Japan's first constitution through his communication with It≈ç Hirobumi. == Biography == After receiving his secondary education at the gymnasium at Eisleben in Prussian Saxony, Gneist entered the Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin in 1833 as a student of jurisprudence, and became a pupil of the famous Roman law teacher Savigny. Proceeding to the degree of doctor juris in 1838, young Gneist immediately established himself as a Privatdozent in the faculty of law. He had, however, already chosen the judicial branch of the legal profession as a career, and having while yet a student acted as Auscultator, was admitted Assessor in 1841. He soon found leisure and opportunity to fulfill a much-cherished wish, and spent the next few years on an extended tour of Italy, France and England. He used his Wanderjahre for the purposes of comparative study, and on his return in 1844 was appointed extraordinary professor of Roman law in the University of Berlin, and thus began a professorial connection which ended only with his death. The first fruits of his activity as a teacher were seen in his brilliant work, Die formellen Vertr√§ge des heutigen r√∂mischen Obligationen-Rechtes (Berlin, 1845). Pari passu with his academic labors he continued his judicial career, and became in due course successively assistant judge of the superior court and of the supreme tribunal. But to a mind constituted such as his, the want of elasticity in the procedure of the courts was galling. In the preface to his Englische Verfassungsgeschichte, Gneist writes that he was brought up \\"in the laborious and rigid school of Prussian judges, at a time when the duty of formulating the matter in litigation was entailed upon the judge who personally conducted the pleadings, I became acquainted both with the advantages possessed by the Prussian bureau system as also with its weak points.\\" Feeling the necessity for fundamental reforms in legal procedure, he published, in 1849, his Trial by Jury, in which, after pointing out that the origin of that institution was common to both Germany and England, and showing in a masterly way the benefits which had accrued to the latter country through its more extended application, he pleaded for its freer admission in the tribunals of his own country. The period of storm and stress in 1848 afforded Gneist an opportunity for which he had yearned, and he threw himself with ardor into the constitutional struggles of Prussia. Although his candidature for election to the National Assembly of that year was unsuccessful, he felt that the die was cast, and, deciding upon a political career, in 1850 retired from his judicial position. Entering the ranks of the National Liberal Party, he began both in writing and speeches actively to champion their cause, now busying himself pre-eminently with the study of constitutional law and history. In 1853 his Adel und Rittershaft was published in England, and in 1857 the Geschichte und heutige Gestalt der √Ñmter in England, a pamphlet primarily written to combat the Prussian abuses of government, but which the author also claimed had not been without its effect in modifying certain views that had until then ruled in England itself. In 1858 Gneist was appointed ordinary professor of Roman law. Also in 1858, he commenced his parliamentary career by his election for Stettin to the Prussian House of Representatives, in which assembly he sat thenceforward uninterruptedly until 1893. Joining the Left, he at once became one of its leading spokesmen. His chief oratorical triumphs are associated with the early period of his membership of the House; two noteworthy occasions being his violent attack (September 1862) upon the government budget in connection with the reorganization of the Prussian army, and his defense (1864) of the Polish chiefs of the Province of Posen, who were accused of high treason. He was a great admirer of the English constitution, and during 1857 to 1863 published Das heutige englische Verfassungs- und Verwaltungsrecht (Contemporary English constitutional law and administration). This work aimed at exercising political pressure upon the government of the day by contrasting English and German constitutional law and administration. Bust of Rudolf von Gneist in the Reichsgericht building in Leipzig In 1868 Gneist became a member of the North German parliament, and acted as a member of the commission for organizing the federal army, and also of that for the settlement of controversial ecclesiastical questions. On the establishment of German unity his mandate was renewed for the Reichstag, and there he served as an active and prominent member of the National Liberal party, until 1884. In the Kulturkampf he sided with the government against the attacks of the Clericals, whom he bitterly denounced, and whose implacable enemy he ever showed himself. In 1879, together with his colleague, H√§nel, he violently attacked the motion for the prosecution of certain socialist members, which as a result of the vigor of his opposition was almost unanimously rejected. He was parliamentary reporter for the committees on all great financial and administrative questions, and his profound acquaintance with constitutional law caused his advice to be frequently sought, not only in his own but also in other countries. In Prussia he greatly influenced legislation, the reform of the judicial and penal systems and the new constitution of the Evangelical Church being largely his work. In 1875, he was appointed a member of the supreme administrative court (Oberverwaltungsgericht) of Prussia, but only held office for two years. He was also consulted by the Japanese government when a constitution was being introduced into that country. In 1882, Japanese Prime Minister of Japan It≈ç Hirobumi and a delegation from Japan visited Europe to study the government systems of various western nations. They met Gneist in Berlin, and he instructed them in constitutional law for a six-month period. The Constitution of the Empire of Japan reflects Gneist's conservatism in limiting the powers of the parliament, and strengthening those of the cabinet. His student, Albert Mosse, was later dispatched to Japan as a legal advisor to the Meiji government. In 1882 was published his Englische Verfassungsgeschichte (trans. History of the English Constitution, London, 1886), which may perhaps be described as his '. It placed the author at once on the level of such writers on English constitutional history as Hallam and Stubbs, and supplied English jurisprudence with a text-book almost unrivalled in its of historical research. In 1888 one of the first acts of the ill-fated Friedrich III, German Emperor, who as crown prince had always shown great admiration for Gneist, was to ennoble him, and attach him as instructor in constitutional law to his son, Wilhelm II, German Emperor. The last years of his life were full of energy, and, in the possession of all his faculties, he continued his academic labors until a short time before his death. Perhaps it should not be said that Gneist's career as a politician was entirely successful. In a country where parliamentary institutions are the living exponents of the popular will he might have risen to a foremost position in the state; as it was, the party to which he allied himself could never hope to become more than what it remained, a parliamentary faction, and the influence it for a time wielded in the counsels of the state waned as soon as the Social-Democratic party grew to be a force to be reckoned with. It is as a writer and a teacher that Gneist is best known to posterity. He was a jurist of a special type: to him law was not mere theory, but a living force; and this conception of its power animates all his schemes of practical reform. As a teacher he exercised a magnetic influence, not only for the clearness and cogency of his exposition, but also because of the success with which he developed the talents and guided the aspirations of his pupils. He was a man of noble bearing, religious, and imbued with a stern sense of duty. He was proud of being a Junker, and throughout his writings, despite their liberal tendencies, may be perceived the loyalty and affection with which he clung to monarchical institutions. == Works == Gneist was a prolific writer, especially on the subject he had made peculiarly his own, that of constitutional law and history, and among his works, other than those above named, may be mentioned the following: *' (Berlin, 1867) *' (Berlin, 1867) * Die Eigenart des Preussischen Staats (1878) *' (Berlin, 1872, and 2nd edition, 1879) *' (Leipzig, 1880) *' (Berlin, 1886); in English translation, The English Parliament (London, 1886; 3rd edition, 1889) *' (Berlin, 1893) *' (Berlin, 1895) *' (Berlin, 1895) See O.

Later on in Diablo, it portrays Ida and his interactions with various people after his absence from the force due to an eye disease while getting wind of mysterious deaths of villagers living in the fictional Amakura Island in Japan's Ishikawa Prefecture in the year 2008 while assisting a police detective in initially trying to figure out who or what was responsible for their deaths after it was reported back in 2007. == Plot == ===Jiraishin: Ice Blade=== Kyoya Ida is a hard-nosed detective from the Shinjuku Police precinct, known to use lethal force to solve cases whenever they need to be solved. He works in a bleak, gritty representation of Shinjuku alongside his partner Tsuyoshi Yamaki in hunting down suspects and arresting them before he was killed in the line of duty. Ida was later assigned to another partner named Eriko Aizawa, the two working together to solve cases pertaining to the city's interests. ===Jirashin Diablo=== In the year 2008, Ida was beginning to suffer from the effects of Keratoconus after leaving the police force. He later gets wind of mysterious deaths of an unknown plague that killed the villagers in Ishikawa Prefecture's Amakura Island when he meets up with Taichi Kogure, a detective of the Ishikawa Police precinct and a now grown up Aya Koike, who is a known information handler in the underworld. == Publication == The manga was serialized in Monthly Afternoon and compiled into 19 volumes published by Kodansha, which started from October 23, 1993 to January 21, 2000 with the first three volumes sold for 509 Yen before the rest were sold for 530 Yen. Reprints came with 10 volumes in bunkoban from May 9, 2003 to September 12, 2003 for 798 Yen with another reprint in aizoban from February 23, 2009 to November 20, 2009 for 1,000 Yen. The North American version of the manga, retitled Ice Blade, was serialized in Tokyopop's MixxZine, but it was discontinued after three volumes. When Jiraishin was serialized as Ice Blade in MixxZine, there were instances of censorships in some of its panels as it was a new magazine when it was released and did not wish to offend potential distributors. For France and French-speaking countries/territories, G√©n√©ration Comics was the publisher before it was taken over by Panini Comics. For Italy, Stars Comics published all 19 volumes. In Germany and German-speaking countries and territories, Carlsen Comics was the publisher. In South Korea, Samyang Comics published Jiraishin in its entirety. In Taiwan, it was published by Tong Li Comics under the Youth Comic series label. Jiraishin Diablo was serialized in good! Afternoon magazine and compiled in three volumes. == Reception == Cassiel Kelner of Aesthesticism.com praised the manga as a study on human nature, \\"reminding [readers] just what people really are capable of\\". Serdar Yegulalp of Advanced Media Network compares Jiraishin to 'Miami Vice as the \\"blood, grit, and sin spatter so thickly that it‚Äôs a miracle you don‚Äôt get your fingers dirty when you turn the pages\\". It won an award in the General Category under the 23rd Kodansha Manga Awards in 1999. ==References== == External links == * Category:1992 manga Category:2010 manga Category:Kodansha manga Category:Seinen manga Category:Tokyopop titles ","title":"Ice Blade"},{"id":"1269112","text":"Eleftheria Arvanitaki (Greek: ŒïŒªŒµœÖŒ∏ŒµœÅŒØŒ± ŒëœÅŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒπœÑŒ¨Œ∫Œ∑) (born October 17, 1957 in Piraeus) is a Greek folk singer.

He was educated at Schulpforta and at the University of Leipzig, where he studied law. In 1743 he became private secretary to his relative, von Spener, the Saxon ambassador at the Danish court. In 1748 he was made professor extraordinary at the academy of Sor√∏, where he died on August 13, 1749. ==Works== Schlegel was a contributor to the Bremer Beitr√§ge and for some time, while he was living in Denmark, edited a weekly periodical, Der Fremde. With his dramas as well as with his critical writings he did much to prepare the way for Lessing, by whom his genius was warmly appreciated. He wrote two lively and well-constructed comedies, Der Triumph der guten Frauen and Die stumme Sch√∂nheit, the former in prose, the latter in alexandrines. Hermann and Canut (both in alexandrines) are generally considered his best tragedies. His works were edited (in 5 vols., 1761‚Äì1770) by his brother, J. H.

The theory of SDSL is based on the specific reaction of spin labels with amino acids. A spin label's built-in protein structure can be detected by EPR spectroscopy. SDSL is also a useful tool in examinations of the protein folding process. ==Spin labeling== proxyl-MTS spin labeled yeast iso-1-cytochrome c. Spin label is attached to Cysteine 102 residue. Site- directed spin labeling (SDSL) was pioneered in the laboratory of Dr. W.L. Hubbell. In SDSL, sites for attachment of spin labels are introduced into recombinantly expressed proteins by site-directed mutagenesis. Functional groups contained within the spin label determine their specificity. At neutral pH, protein thiol groups specifically react with the functional groups methanethiosulfonate, maleimide, and iodoacetamide, creating a covalent bond with the amino acid Cys. Spin labels are a unique molecular reporter, in that they are paramagnetic (contain an unpaired electron). Spin labels were first synthesized in the laboratory of H. M. McConnell in 1965. Since then, a variety of nitroxide spin labels have enjoyed widespread use for the study of macromolecular structure and dynamics because of their stability and simple EPR signal. The nitroxyl radical (N-O) is usually incorporated into a heterocyclic ring (e.g. pyrrolidine), and the unpaired electron is predominantly localized to the N-O bond. Once incorporated into the protein, a spin label's motions are dictated by its local environment. Because spin labels are exquisitely sensitive to motion, this has profound effects on its EPR spectrum. The assembly of multi-subunit membrane protein complexes has also been studied using spin labeling. The binding of the PsaC subunit to the PsaA and PsaB subunits of the photosynthetic reaction center, Photosystem I, has been analyzed in great detail using this technique. Dr. Ralf Langen's group showed that SDSL with EPR (University of Southern California, Los Angeles) can be used to understand the structure of amyloid fibrils and the structure of membrane bound Parkinson's disease protein alpha-synuclein. A 2012 study generated a high resolution structure of IAPP fibrils using a combination of SDSL, pulse EPR and computational biology. ==References== Category:Analytical chemistry Category:Spectroscopy Category:Protein methods ","title":"Site-directed spin labeling"},{"id":"1269126","text":"Peter Spencer Bowness, Baron Bowness, (born 19 May 1943) is a British Conservative politician, solicitor, and life peer.

The term was used from 1562. Wojsko kwarciane was formed from earlier obrona potoczna units. The term \\"quarter\\" in the name of the army () comes from the type of the tax paid for their upkeep (kwarta tax): a quarter of income from the regals lands (kr√≥lewszczyzny) was supposed to be used for that purpose. As monarchs usually leased their land to szlachta (or merchants, or Jews) for short-term benefits, they didn't have direct control over cash flow and this often resulted in corruption and delayed payment of military wages. Military commanders (hetmans) often had to pay the wages of wojsko kwarciane and hired mercenaries from their own purse. Sometimes disgruntled unpaid units formed confederacies (see konfederacja) in order to lawfully collect their wages by force. The standing numbers of wojsko kwarciane varied by peacetime and wartime. On average during peacetime the army totalled about 2500 cavalry. It was a relatively small army when compared with other contemporary countries, especially considering the Commonwealth's huge area. In effect, Commonwealth armies were almost always stretched thin defending its territory from its aggressive neighbours (Sweden, Russia and Ottoman Empire vassals).

It stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and Raul Julia, along with supporting performances by Byron Mann, Damian Chapa, Kylie Minogue, Ming-Na Wen and Wes Studi. Loosely following the plot of Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, the film focuses on the efforts of Colonel Guile (Van Damme) to bring down General M. Bison (Juli√°), the military dictator and drug kingpin of Shadaloo City who aspires to conquer the world with an army of genetic supersoldiers, while enlisting the aid of street fighters Ryu (Mann) and Ken (Chapa) to infiltrate Bison's empire and help destroy it from within. The film was a commercial success, with a worldwide box office gross approximately three times its production costs, and its home video releases and television broadcasts were also profitable, with the film earning Capcom a return of () from the box office and home media, but the film itself was not well-received by critics or fans of the games for its campy tones, use of characters and unfaithfulness to the source material. Ra√∫l Juli√°'s performance as M. Bison, however, was met with widespread critical acclaim and garnered him a posthumous nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Saturn Awards, while the film was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film. The film was also Julia's final theatrical performance, as he died of a stroke two months before the film's release; the film is dedicated to his memory. An intended reboot, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li, was released in 2009 to critical and commercial failure, while a much more positively-received British television series focusing on Ryu and Ken, Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist, was released in 2014. ==Plot== In the Southeast Asian nation of Shadaloo, civil war has erupted between the forces of drug lord-turned General M. Bison and the Allied Nations led by Colonel William F. Guile. Bison has captured several A.N. relief workers, and via a live two-way radio broadcast, demands Guile secure a US$20 billion ransom in three days. Guile refuses and vows to track Bison down and place him on trial for his crimes, but his assistant, Sergeant Cammy, is only partially able to pinpoint Bison's location to the river-delta region outside the city. One hostage is Guile's friend Sergeant Carlos \\"Charlie\\" Blanka, who Bison orders taken to his lab for his captive doctor and scientist, Dhalsim, to turn into the first of his supersoldiers. Though Charlie is severely disfigured by the procedure, Dhalsim secretly alters his cerebral programming to maintain Charlie's humanity. American con artists Ryu Hoshi and Ken Masters attempt to swindle arms dealer Viktor Sagat by providing him with fake weaponry. Sagat sees through the ruse and has Ryu fight his cage champion, Vega, but Guile bursts in and arrests everyone present for violating a curfew. In the prison grounds, Guile witnesses Ryu and Ken fighting Sagat's men, and recruits them to help him find Bison in exchange for their freedom, since Sagat is Bison's arms supplier. They are given a homing device and win Sagat's trust by staging a prison escape and faking Guile's death. However, news reporter Chun-Li, whose father was killed by Bison, and her crew, former sumo wrestler E. Honda and boxer Balrog, who are out for revenge against Sagat for ruining their careers, stumble across the plan, and over Guile's objections, attempt to assassinate the two warlords at a party. To maintain Bison's trust, Ryu and Ken stop the assassination and reveal the conspirators to Bison. Returning to his base, Bison inducts Ryu and Ken into his organization and orders Honda and Balrog imprisoned and Chun-Li taken to his quarters. Ryu and Ken break Balrog and Honda out of confinement and rush to confront Bison, who is fighting Chun- Li, but Bison escapes and releases sleeping gas, sedating them all. Guile plans his assault on Bison's base. He is impeded by the Deputy Secretary of the A.N., who informs Guile that the decision has been made to pay Bison the ransom, but Guile and his loyal troops nevertheless proceed with the mission. At the base, Dhalsim is found out by a security guard; during the ensuing fight, Charlie is released, and he kills the guard to protect Dhalsim. Guile arrives and sneaks into the lab, where he encounters Charlie. Guile prepares to shoot Charlie to end his suffering, but Dhalsim stops him. Bison prepares to kill the hostages by unleashing Charlie on them, but Guile emerges and engages Bison's guards until the remaining A.N. forces arrive. After Bison makes it clear that he will not surrender peacefully, Guile orders his allies to rescue the hostages and engages Bison in a personal duel. As Guile and Bison fight, Ryu and Ken defeat Sagat and Vega. Bison's computer expert Dee Jay flees through a secret passage, joined by Sagat, while Bison's bodyguard, Zangief, engages Honda in a fight until learning from Dee Jay that Bison was the true enemy, and sides with Ryu and Ken to save the hostages. Guile gains the upper hand against Bison and kicks him into a bank of hard drives, electrocuting him. A revival system restores Bison and he reveals that his suit is powered by electromagnetism, enabling him to fly and fire electricity. Bison takes control of the fight, beating Guile viciously, and moves to deal the death blow, but Guile counters by kicking Bison into his monitor wall, finishing him off and overloading the base's energy field. The hostages are rescued, but Guile stays behind to convince Dhalsim and Charlie to return with him. They refuse, with Dhalsim wishing to atone for his part in mutating Charlie. Guile flees the exploding base and reunites with his comrades. In a post-credits scene, Bison is revived once again amidst his ruined command center to try his hand at world conquest one more time. ==Cast== *Jean-Claude Van Damme as Colonel Guile *Raul Julia as Bison *Ming-Na Wen as Chun-Li *Damian Chapa as Ken *Kylie Minogue as Cammy *Simon Callow as A.N.

Hawk *Kenya Sawada as Captain Sawada *Jay Tavare as Vega *Peter Tuiasosopo as Honda *Wes Studi as Sagat *Joe Bugner as Bison's Torturer ==Production== The film's production budget was (), with Capcom alone financing most of the budget. Because Capcom was co- financier of the film, every aspect of the production required their approval. Among other points, they mandated a December 1994 release date, which required the cast and crew to maintain an aggressive filming schedule. DeSouza says he wrote the initial draft of the script overnight, being made aware that Capcom executives were in Los Angeles on short notice and because he himself was a fan of the game. Capcom had long envisioned Jean-Claude Van Damme as Guile and asked him to be cast. Ra√∫l Juli√° claimed in an interview that he accepted the role of Bison because his children are huge fans of the video game series and helped him prepare for the role. After Van Damme and Juli√° were cast as Guile and Bison, most of the casting budget had been spent. Van Damme's fee alone took nearly $8 million of the film's $35-million budget. This meant that the majority of other parts had to go to little-known or unknown actors, such as Byron Mann, Damian Chapa, Peter Navy Tuiasosopo and Grand L. Bush. Kylie Minogue was cast as Cammy as a result of the Australian Actors' Guild wanting Steven E. de Souza to hire an Australian actor. By the time he received the request the only part not cast was that of Cammy. De Souza first learned of Minogue from her cover photo on a \\"World's 30 Most Beautiful People\\" edition of Who magazine. Japanese actor Kenya Sawada appeared in the film as a part of a promotional contract with Capcom. The cast's physical training was handled by Hollywood trainer and world karate champion Benny Urquidez. Charlie Picerni was hired as the stunt coordinator; he took the job with the condition that he would need ample time to train the cast. De Souza agreed; however plans were switched once it was learned that Ra√∫l Juli√° was suffering from cancer. Initially plans were to shoot Juli√°'s less intensive scenes first while the rest of the cast would train with Picerni, however upon seeing Juli√°, de Souza realized that they could not show him in his current weakened state and was forced to switch the filming around. This led to an environment where the cast would be trained only right before their scenes‚Äîsometimes only hours ahead. De Souza stated that he did not want to make a generic martial arts movie and described the film as cross between Star Wars, James Bond and a war film. In addition, he indicated that he also did not want to shoehorn in elements from the games, citing the previous year's poorly received Super Mario Bros. film as an example. De Souza said that he avoided the supernatural elements and powers from the games but would hint at their use for a sequel. Street Fighter was filmed mostly in Queensland, Australia along the famous Gold Coast during the second and third quarters of 1994 with most of the interiors and exteriors filmed on soundstages in Brisbane. Some exterior scenes were filmed in Bangkok, Thailand which were used as the backdrop for the fictitious Shadaloo City. The Bangkok scenes were filmed first, in the second quarter of 1994, with filming in Australia beginning after three weeks in Bangkok. DeSouza envisioned the attack on Bison's hide-out to include helicopters but was unable to do so due to the political instability in the neighbouring Myanmar, which is why the AN troops attack via boats instead. This was referenced in the film's final script. The MPAA gave the first submitted cut of the film an R classification which was unacceptably high for Capcom, who had stated from the start that it should be a PG-13 film. After various cuts were made a G rating‚Äîaccording to de Souza‚Äîwas given which was bumped up to PG-13 with the addition of an expletive in post production. In a post-credits scene, Bison's computer is reactivated from solar power and the revival system restores Bison again. His fist smashes through the rubble and a computer screen is shown selecting \\"World Domination: Replay\\", setting the stage for a sequel. This scene was omitted from the theatrical release \\"out of deference to Raul Julia\\". ==Music== ===Soundtrack=== A soundtrack was released on December 6, 1994 by Priority Records featuring mostly rap music. The soundtrack found mild success, peaking at #135 on the Billboard 200 and #34 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums. Upon its release on home video in the United Kingdom, the soundtrack was given away free with every purchase of the VHS tape at branches of Tesco for a limited period. Although this was the only way for anybody in the UK to purchase the CD, \\"Straight to My Feet\\" by Hammer was still released as a single, which charted #57 in the UK. ===Score=== Graeme Revell composed the film's score, an hour of which was released by Var√®se Sarabande. Revell ignored previously existing music from the franchise. The music differs from Revell's more popular style, most notably with the absence of pervasive electronic elements, and is entirely orchestral as the score is performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. The campy style of the film is reflected in the score's parody cues. The music during the scene where Ryu faces Vega in the cage fight quotes Georges Bizet's Habanera from the opera Carmen, and a theme heard throughout the score, particularly in the track \\"Colonel Guile Addresses the Troops\\", is reminiscent of Bruce Broughton's main theme for Tombstone. ==Release== Street Fighter had opened in New York and Los Angeles on December 23, 1994. ===Box office=== The film earned $3,124,775 on its opening day. It grossed $9,508,030 on its opening weekend, ranking at #3 behind Dumb and Dumber and The Santa Clause at the box office. On its second weekend it grossed $7,178,360 and dropped down to #7. The film grossed $33,423,521 at the domestic box office and $66,000,000 at the international box office, making a total of $99,423,521 worldwide. ===Home media=== The film was released on the VHS format in 1995, initially for video rental stores. In the United States, the film sold more than 250,000 rental tapes in 1995. The film was also broadcast on cable television, and later released on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital streaming. The film's home video releases and television broadcasts have been profitable for Capcom, which earned a return of () from the film's box office and home media revenue. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== Amidst the film's negative critical reception, Ra√∫l Juli√°'s performance as Bison was widely praised, and garnered him a posthumous nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor. The film was his last theatrical performance, and he personally chose it as his children were huge fans of the game series. Leonard Maltin gave the film his lowest rating, writing that \\"even Jean-Claude Van Damme fans couldn't rationalize this bomb.\\"Maltin, Leonard (2009), p. 1333. Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide. . Signet Books. Accessed June 20, 2010. Richard Harrington of The Washington Post said the film was \\"notable only for being the last film made by Ra√∫l Juli√°, an actor far too skilled for the demands of the evil warlord, Gen. M. Bison, but far too professional to give anything less than his best.\\" Critic Stephen Holden of The New York Times referred to the film as \\"a dreary, overstuffed hodgepodge of poorly edited martial arts sequences and often unintelligible dialogue\\". Writing for Variety, Emanuel Levy stated that the film \\"suffers from the same problems that impaired ‚ÄúSuper Mario Bros.‚Äù: It‚Äôs noisy, overblown and effects-laden and lacks sustained action or engaging characters.\\" Levy commented on Julia, referring to it as \\"his weakest performances, accentuating each and every syllable as if he were reciting a Shakespearean role of grand emotional range. It‚Äôs too bad, for this is the accomplished actor‚Äôs last film, and it is dedicated to him.\\" Leslie Felperin of Sight & Sound described Kylie Minogue as Cammy \\"hilarious miscasting as a military wench with Heidi plaits. The merest glimpse of her holding a bazooka and looking mean is enough to induce giggles in the most dour of viewers.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B‚àí\\" on an A+ to F scale. It holds a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 40 critic reviews, with the consensus reading, \\"Though it offers mild entertainment through campy one-liners and the overacting of the late Raul Julia, Street Fighters nonstop action sequences are not enough to make up for a predictable, uneven storyline.\\" === Awards === In 2009, Time listed the film on their list of top ten worst video games movies. GameTrailers ranked the film as the eighth worst video game film of all time. The film also received two nominations at the Saturn Awards: Best Science Fiction Film and Best Supporting Actor (a posthumous nomination for Ra√∫l Juli√°). ==Related media== A one shot comic book adaptation of the film, titled Street Fighter: The Battle for Shadaloo, was published by DC Comics in 1995. The comic was drawn by Nick J. Napolitano and written by Mike McAvennie. A Japanese one-shot manga adaptation by Takayuki Sakai was also published in the June 1995 issue of CoroCoro Comics Special. Two video games based on the film were produced. The first was a coin-operated arcade game titled Street Fighter: The Movie, produced by American developer Incredible Technologies and distributed by Capcom. The second was a home video game developed by Capcom also titled Street Fighter: The Movie, released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. Despite sharing the same title, neither game is a port of the other, although they both used the same digitized footage of the films cast posing as the characters in each game. Capcom also announced that an \\"enhanced port\\" was being created for the Sega 32X by their newly formed USA research and development department. This version was never released. Many plot elements of the film, such as Blanka's identity and Dhalsim's role as a scientist, were reused in the American-produced 1995 Street Fighter animated series, a follow- up to this film which combined story aspects of the film with those in the games. ==References* * * Category:1994 films Category:1990s action comedy films Category:1990s science fiction comedy films Category:1990s martial arts films Category:War comedy films Category:American action comedy films Category:American films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films adapted into comics Category:Films adapted into video games Category:Films directed by Steven E. de Souza Category:Films scored by Graeme Revell Category:Live-action films based on video games Category:Films set in Thailand Category:Films shot in Queensland Category:Foreign films shot in Thailand Category:Martial arts comedy films Category:Martial arts science fiction films Category:Street Fighter films Category:Underground fighting films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:1994 comedy films ","title":"Street Fighter (1994 film)"},{"id":"1269169","text":"Johnstone William \\"John\\" Thwaites (born 15 October 1955), is a former Australian politician, and served as Deputy Premier of the state of Victoria from 1999 to 2007. ==Early life == Thwaites was born in Oxford, in the United Kingdom, and came to Australia as a child with his family. He was educated at Melbourne Grammar School and Monash University, Melbourne, where he graduated in science and law. He practised as a barrister before entering politics. He was a ministerial advisor to Labor Party state government ministers Jim Kennan and Andrew McCutcheon before being elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for the seat of Albert Park. == Local council and Mayor == Thwaites was elected to the South Melbourne City Council in 1985 and served until 1993, and was Mayor in 1991‚Äì92. He is married to Melanie Eagle, who was mayor of the neighbouring city of St Kilda at the same time. Both councils are now part of the City of Port Phillip. Thwaites and Eagle have one son. == State Parliament == Thwaites entered Parliament at the 1992 election, as member for the inner city seat of Albert Park. Labor, having been in office for ten years, suffered a landslide defeat at the hands of the Liberal Party under Jeff Kennett. In the last three years of its term, Labor, under Joan Kirner, had presided over a sharp recession and a series of financial disasters including the forced sale of the State Bank of Victoria, and the collapse of Pyramid Building Society. Most commentators expected Labor to be in opposition for many years. In the greatly reduced Labor Caucus, Thwaites gained rapid promotion. He became Shadow Minister for Health in January 1994, Shadow Minister for Health and Community Services in April 1996, and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in December 1996. Thwaites belonged to neither of the dominant factions of the Victorian Labor Party, the right-wing Labor Unity or the left-wing Socialist Left, and was an acceptable compromise candidate as Deputy to the then Opposition Leader, John Brumby. Labor was again heavily defeated at the 1996 election, and it became apparent that the party could not recover under Brumby's leadership. Thwaites had been a loyal deputy to Brumby, although in March 1999 he supported moves to have Brumby resign. Thwaites could not become Leader himself because he had a small factional base, but instead supported Steve Bracks for the leadership. As Shadow Minister for Health, Thwaites campaigned against the Kennett Government‚Äôs cuts to health and the privatisation of ambulance services. He used Freedom of Information documents to highlight long delays in hospital emergency departments and health budget cuts. (‚ÄúAustin in patient crisis, says Labor‚Äù, The Age, 3 October 1996.) Thwaites also highlighted concerns about privatisation of ambulance dispatching to a private company, Intergraph, which the Auditor General found ‚Äúat best involved serious mismanagement or, at worst, constituted corrupt activity‚Äù. (‚ÄúState backs Intergraph reports bid‚Äù, The Age, 3 September 1999). The Intergraph affair and concerns about hospital privatisation and ambulance services were major issues in the 1999 state election. (‚ÄúSelloffs the big difference‚Äù The Age 9 September 1999. ‚ÄúAmbulance scandal threatens Kennett‚Äù The Age 28 September 1999). === Deputy Leader === In September 1999 Bracks polled surprisingly well in the election, and three rural independent members gave Labor the opportunity to govern as a minority government. As Deputy Leader, Thwaites became Deputy Premier and was given the senior Health portfolio, with a mandate to increase funding to the public health system which had been the subject of cutbacks under the Liberal government. He was also Minister for Planning from 1999 to February 2002. Shortly after taking office, Thwaites cancelled the proposed privatisation of the Austin Hospital and announced plans for the government to rebuild the hospital with public funds. (‚ÄúLabor to cancel Austin hospital privatisation‚Äù The Age 28 October 1999) (‚ÄúCan the new government fix health? The Age 20 November 1999). Like all state health ministers, he had only limited success in reducing waiting lists at public hospitals, but did succeed in restoring the numbers of nurses. One of Thwaites first actions as Health Minister was to ban smoking in restaurants (‚ÄúButt out‚Äù Herald Sun 27 November 1999.) He later introduced legislation to ban smoking in gaming venues. (‚ÄúSmokers butt out at pokies‚Äù Herald Sun 30 August 2002). As Planning Minister, Thwaites put controls on high-rise development around Port Phillip Bay and introduced a residential planning code, Rescode, to preserve neighbourhood character in planning decisions. (‚ÄúLimits put on bayside high-rise‚Äù Herald Sun 14 December 1999.) He also initiated Melbourne 2030, a 30 year strategy plan for Melbourne. After the November 2002 state election, at which Labor was returned with a record majority, Thwaites was appointed Minister for Environment, Water and Victorian Communities. Thwaites‚Äô term as Minister for Water coincided with the millennium drought in southeast Australia that put significant pressure on urban and rural water supplies. Premier Steve Bracks and Thwaites led a major water saving campaign commencing in 2003 that by 2006 had reduced water use per head by 22 per cent compared to the 1990s. Thwaites introduced major reforms to water policy and legislation in Victoria including giving the environment a statutory right to water, reforming irrigation water rights and establishing sustainable water planning strategies. He also oversaw programs to return environmental flows to the Murray, Snowy and Thomson rivers. In 2007, after Victoria had experienced its worst year of drought and the lowest streamflows in the state‚Äôs history, Premier Steve Bracks and Thwaites announced the Our Water Our Future plan which included a new desalination plant at Wonthaggi, modernising Victoria‚Äôs irrigation system to save water lost through inefficiencies, expanding a water grid across Victoria and increased recycling and water conservation. As Minister for Environment, Thwaites introduced measures to lower greenhouse emissions and water consumption. Victoria was the first state to introduce five-star energy efficiency requirements for new homes together with incentives for rainwater tanks and solar hot water. Thwaites also oversaw a major expansion of Victoria‚Äôs National Park system including creation of the Great Otway National Park, and removed cattle grazing from the Alpine National Park. In the second term of the Bracks Government, Thwaites led the development of the Government‚Äôs social justice strategy, A Fairer Victoria working with other social policy ministers. The strategy committed $788 million in the 2005 state budget and $818 million in the 2006 budget to tackle disadvantage across a range of areas including early childhood development, mental health, disability, and community development. It was described by the head of the Brotherhood of St Laurence as ‚Äúan unprecedented effort to make Victoria a better place for those who are disadvantaged and vulnerable.‚Äù Thwaites was re- elected at Victorian elections 2006 with a comfortable but slightly reduced majority. While there was some speculation he might be dumped as Deputy Premier, Premier Bracks has supported him continuing in this role. In the cabinet re-shuffle after the election he became minister for climate change but lost the portfolio of Victorian communities.New faces for Cabinet  Herald Sun ==== White Anting ==== In June 2007, rumours of Steve Bracks resigning as premier, a series for leaks from inside government about Mr Thwaites and his family been given free accommodation, lift passes, food and drink at ski resorts over the last five years without declaring it.

Opposition pushes for probe of Thwaites' free holidays Thwaites backs Brumby as leader Documents obtained under freedom-of- information laws show Thwaites made 17 taxpayer-funded visits to Victoria's snowfields and national parks between 2003 and 2007. He had eight stays at Tidal River on Wilsons Promontory, five trips to Mount Hotham and two each to Mount Buller and Falls Creek in the four years he was environment minister. Expenses for the trips, which each required at least one night's accommodation, totalled more than $17,500. Thwaites ski trips cost taxpayers $17500 === Resignation === When Premier Steve Bracks announced his surprise resignation on 27 July 2007, only hours later Thwaites announced he too would resign.Victorian deputy premier quits too  National Breaking News  News.com.au He said he had been Deputy Leader of the Parliamentary Labor Party in Victoria for ten years and it was now time \\"to give someone else a go and bring in some new blood\\".Thwaites follows Bracks into retirement - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) He officially resigned on 30 July 2007. ==Post-Deputy Premiership career== Since leaving politics, Thwaites has become a Professor at Monash University and Chair of its Sustainability Institute and ClimateWorks Australia. Thwaites has also been appointed to a number of senior board positions including President, Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI), Chair Australian Building Codes Board, Chair the Climate Group Ltd,, Chair Peter Cullen Trust and director Green Building Council of Australia and Fair Trade Australia New Zealand. He was also a consultant to Maddocks Solicitors with specialty areas of practice in environment, water and climate change between 2008 and 2015.Maddocks (2008). Sustainability & Climate Change Team at Maddocks . Retrieved 13 October 2008. In 2011, Thwaites was appointed as Chair of the Australian Building Codes Board, the body responsible for developing and managing Australia's building regulations. In 2012, he was appointed as Chair of the National Sustainability Council that provides independent advice to the Australian Government on sustainability issues and produces independent reports on sustainability indicators and trends. Thwaites is currently the Chair of Melbourne Water, which manages Melbourne‚Äôs water, sewerage, drainage and waterway health, and sits on a number of water advisory bodies. Thwaites has been appointed to a number of reviews and advisory bodies for the Australian and state governments. In 2016, the Victorian Government appointed him with the Hon Terry Mulder and Patricia Faulkner AO to conduct an independent review of retail electricity and gas markets. The review recommended major reforms to energy pricing for households and small business including a ‚Äúno frills‚Äù electricity price to be regulated by the Essential Services Commission, the end of misleading marketing, and requiring retailers to fix offer prices for 12 months. The Victorian Government has now implemented most of these reforms. In 2017, amidst public concern about flammable cladding on buildings, Thwaites was appointed with former Victorian Premier Ted Baillieu to co-chair the Victorian Cladding Taskforce to oversee the investigation and audit of buildings with dangerous cladding. Following recommendations of the Cladding Taskforce, the Victorian Government conducted a statewide audit of multi-story buildings, boosted enforcement of building regulations and announced a $600 million plan to remove dangerous cladding from buildings. Since leaving politics, Thwaites has worked with governments, business and academics to promote sustainable development and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In 2012, he was appointed by the Australian Government as Chair of the National Sustainability Council to provide independent advice to the Government on sustainability issues. The Council produced the Sustainable Australia Report 2013. He currently chairs the National Sustainable Development Council which in 2018 produced the Transforming Australia: SDG Progress report on Australia‚Äôs progress in implementing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. He is currently Co-Chair of the Leadership Council of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) launched by the Secretary General of the United Nations to mobilise universities in support of the Sustainable Development Goals. In July 2020, Thwaites was appointed to The Lancet Covid-19 Commission which aims to speed up global and equitable solutions to the pandemic. ==References== Category:1955 births Category:People educated at Melbourne Grammar School Category:Living people Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Victoria Category:Monash Law School alumni Category:Deputy Premiers of Victoria Category:Members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly Category:Monash University faculty Category:20th-century Australian lawyers Category:21st-century Australian politicians ","title":"John Thwaites (Australian politician)"},{"id":"1269172","text":"George Smalridge circa 1714 George Smalridge (alias Smallridge; 18 May 1662 ‚Äì 27 September 1719) was Bishop of Bristol (1714‚Äì1719). ==Life== Smalridge was born at Lichfield, son of the Sheriff of Lichfield Thomas Smalridge, George received his early education, this being completed at Westminster School and at Christ Church, Oxford. His political opinions were largely modelled on those of his friend Francis Atterbury, with whom he was associated at Oxford and elsewhere. After being a tutor at Christ Church, he was minister of two chapels in London, and for six or seven years he acted as deputy for William Jane, the regius professor of divinity at Oxford; his Jacobite opinions, however, prevented him from securing this position when it fell vacant in 1707. In 1711, he was made dean of Carlisle Cathedral and canon of Christ Church, and in 1713 he succeeded Atterbury as dean of Christ Church. In the following year he was appointed bishop of Bristol, but retained his deanery. In 1715 Smalridge refused to sign the declaration against the pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart, defending his action in his Reasons for not signing the Declaration. In other ways also he showed animus against the house of Hanover, but his only punishment was his removal from the post of lord almoner to the king. The bishop was esteemed by Swift, Steele, Whiston and other famous men of his day, while Dr Johnson declared his sermons to be of the highest class. ==Works== *Sixty Sermons, preached on Several Occasions, 1726.

In 1648 he was chosen to be Recorder of London, and he was one of the four counsel appointed to conduct the case against Charles I in January 1649, but illness prevented him from discharging this duty. However, a few days later he took part in the prosecution of James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton and other leading Royalists. Steele was elected MP for the City of London in 1654. He was Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1655, and was made lord chancellor of Ireland in 1656. After the fall of Richard Cromwell he was one of the five commissioners appointed in 1659 to govern Ireland. At the end of this year he returned to England, but he refused to sit on the committee of safety to which he had been named.

It is the capital of Chalkidiki. ==Geography== Polygyros town (pop. 6,121 at the 2011 census) is built in the shape of an amphitheatre on a plateau on the south west side of the mountain Cholomontas. It is south of Greek National Road 16 (Thessaloniki - Arnaia). Polygyros is located SE of Thessaloniki, NE of Nea Moudania, NW of Sithonia and SW of Arnaia. The municipal unit (the municipality before 2011) has a population of 10,721 inhabitants and a land area of 470.933 km¬≤. Other large villages in the municipal unit are Kal√Ωves Polyg√Ωrou (1,333), √ìlynthos (1,111), Taxi√°rchis (903), and Vr√°stama (700). ==Name== There are different speculations about the origin of Polygyros' name. Some claim that it comes from the combination of poly (much) and geros (strong), because of the healthy climate. Others believe that the words poly and ieros (sacred) have given the present name, because of an ancient temple in the area. Also an old landowner, named Polyaros, offers a possible etymology. According to another possible etymology, the name derives from poly and gyros (round), possible due to the town's amphitheatric position.Babiniotis, G. (1998). Lexiko tis Neas Ellinikis Glossas. Kentro Lexikologias. Athina. ==Municipality== The municipality Polygyros was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 4 former municipalities, that became municipal units:Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior *Anthemountas *Ormylia *Polygyros *Zervochoria The municipality has an area of 947.417 km2, the municipal unit 470.933 km2. ==History== Archaeological Museum of Polygyros Polygyros town hall View of a square Saint Nicholas church in Polygyros ===Antiquity=== Some situate in the broader area of modern Polygyros the ancient city of Apollonia. Apollonia was one of the 32 cities, which, under the leadership of the Olynthus, constituted the Koinon ton Chalkideon (Chalkidian League). The Koinon was destroyed in 379 BCE by the Spartans, while in 348 BCE Philipp II of Macedon annexed the whole Chalcidice into the Macedonian Kingdom.

In 1430, as the rest of the Eastern Roman Empire, Polygyros was conquered by the Ottomans and belonged to the Sanjak of Thessaloniki. On 17 May 1821 the people of Polygyros rose against the Ottoman authority and managed, temporarily, to expel the Ottoman guard. Polygyros, such as other villages of the peninsula, were burned by the Ottomans. Many residents of Polygyros also took part in the 1854's unsuccessful revolutionary movement against the Ottomans. ===Modern Era=== Finally, on November 2, 1912 the Greek army, as one of the victors of the First Balkan War, entered Polygyros and incorporated the town in the Greek State. ==Culture== Polygyros is famous for its carnival celebrations, which attracts visitors from all over Greece. A nearby location called Panagia (Virgin Mary) is the setting of a famous religious celebration on August 15. Also, cultural societies are active in the fields of folk music and dance. Classic and modern music is cultivated in the municipal conservatory. There is a Folklore Museum in the town, opened in 1998. ===Sports=== Niki (victory) is the name of Polygyros' football club, which participates in the Greek National Fourth Division Professional League. AOP (Athletic Club of Polygyros) is the local basketball team, participant in the Third National Basketball Division. ==Landmarks== The Archaeological Museum of Polygyros has exhibits containing findings from all over Halkidiki and referring to paleolithical and neolithical age, geometric, archaic, classic, hellenistic and Roman period. *Archaeological Museum of Polygyros ==Historical population== { class= !

Both lines are operated by the Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe AG, who also operate the city's tram, bus and ferry networks. ==History== Although the construction of the line has been discussed and planned since 1873, the permit to build the railway was not issued until 1893. The railway was opened on October 26, 1895, and was originally run by a steam engine. In 1910 the line was converted to run on electricity, and in 1912 its operation was transferred to the Dresden municipal tramways, whose successors still operate it. During the bombing of Dresden on the 13 February 1945, the lower station of the funicular was destroyed. However the lines cars had been moved for safety into the line's tunnels and survived. Major renewals took place in 1978 and 1993. On January 6, 2014, the line was again closed for a major refurbishment of both the cars and the line.

Jab≈Çonowski was a candidate for the Polish Throne following the death of King John III Sobieski. A talented and skillful political and military leader, Jab≈Çonowski participated in the War with Sweden during The Deluge, then with the Cossacks and Muscovy. He took part in the Chocim campaign of 1673 and participated in the Vienna expedition of 1683. He led the right wing of Polish cavalry forces at the Battle of Vienna. He also stopped the Tatars at Lw√≥w in 1695. In 1692 Jab≈Çonowski built the stronghold and the neighbouring town of Okopy ≈öwiƒôtej Tr√≥jcy. During the Royal election of 1697, he supported Augustus II, later in opposition to the King. His daughter Anna Jab≈Çonowska, who married Rafa≈Ç Leszczy≈Ñski, was the mother of King Stanis≈Çaw I. ==Biography== ===Early life, studies and first commands=== Stanis≈Çaw was son of the Lord Sword-Bearer Jan Jab≈Çonowski (1600‚Äì1647) and Anna Ostror√≥g, the daughter of author and scholar Jan Ostror√≥g. Jab≈Çonowski began his military career in 1655, leading several battles against Russia and the Cossacks. In 1657 he took part in the war against Moldavia and George II R√°k√≥czi. Later he distinguished himself during the war with Sweden (1656), known as \\"The Deluge\\", fighting under the command of the great general Stefan Czarniecki. In 1659 he fought in Polish occupied Ukraine under the command of Stanis≈Çaw \\"Rewera\\" Potocki and Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski. From 1664 he was the voivode (governor) of Ruthenia and in later years he fought against the invading Turks and Tatars, alongside with Hetman John Sobieski (future King John III). He took part in the Polish-Cossack-Tatar War of 1666‚Äì71, he commanded a unit belonging to Sobieski, most notably, at the battle of Podhajce. ===Professional military career=== After the unexpected abdication of King John II Casimir in 1668, Jab≈Çonowski supported the candidacy of the French prince Louis, Grand Cond√© to the Polish crown. In 1673 he led the successful charge of the Polish winged hussars at Chocim and in 1674 he successfully defeated the Turkish garrison in Kamieniec Podolski. In 1675 Jab≈Çonowski defended the city of Z≈Çocz√≥w against the Turks and in 1676 he commanded a part of the Polish army near ≈ªurawno. At the Battle of Vienna he commanded the Polish right wing of the allied forces. Monument to Hetman Jab≈Çonowski in Lw√≥w (now Lviv) During the 1673 election, Jab≈Çonowski, being fierce supporter of John Sobieski, greatly contributed to Sobieski's election as king. In 1676 Jab≈Çonowski was nominated as the Field Hetman of the Polish forces and from then on became the protector the south- eastern provinces of the Kingdom of Poland, known as Kresy or Kresy Wschodnie (lit. Eastern Borderlands). In 1683 the Sejm (parliament) granted him the Hetman's baton. Previously, however, because in 1681 he was active in political life, he was accused of being part of several intrigues against King John III. For this reason, the king didn't allow the parliament to grant him any titles. In the following years he participated in all the battles on the south-eastern fringe; in 1685 he led the unsuccessful expedition to Bukovina and in 1686 he took part in an expedition to Wallachia. In 1692 he became the castellan of Krak√≥w. In the same year he unsuccessfully besieged Kamieniec Podolski, which has previously fallen into enemy hands. In 1694 he took part in the campaign near the town of U≈õcieczko where he crushed the allied Tatar and Turkish forces. In 1695 he took part in the great defeat of the last Tatar army at the Battle of Lw√≥w, for which the people of the city erected a monument and a statue with the likeness of Hetman Jab≈Çonowski. In his honor, one of the main streets of the city was renamed to Hetma≈Ñska ‚Äì literally meaning Hetman's Avenue. After the death of King John III Sobieski (1696) he was one of the leading candidates for the crown, however due to the intervention of the Russian and Saxon forces, the Elector of Saxony, Augustus II the Strong, was chosen instead. In 1699 the Ottomans returned the city and fortress of Kamieniec Podolski, which was again lost during the unsuccessful reign of Michael I. Jab≈Çonowski's long life was marked by a large sacrifice, primarily as a warrior, and for the purposes of the war he did not spare any of his own, private money, for which he enjoyed great success and popularity among his soldiers and political allies. He died on April 3, 1702. ==Battle of Vienna and relationship with Sobieski== Hetman Jab≈Çonowski, painted by Piotr Micha≈Çowski In the Battle of Vienna Jab≈Çonowski commanded the right wing of the Polish army. In the subsequent years, the heavy burden of command in the expedition against the Turks and Tartars affected both Jab≈Çonowski and the King. Popular among his soldiers, he spent large sums of money on military expeditions and from his own resources maintained garrisons and frontier fortresses. These fortresses not only protected the country's eastern borderlands, but also protected his own assets located within the Ruthenian Voivodeship. During the reign of John III, Jab≈Çonowski believed that after the death of the monarch he would receive the crown. In 1687, during the long illness of John III, Queen Maria Kazimiera hinted that while widowed she could marry the Hetman. After the death of Sobieski in the year 1696, Jab≈Çonowski supported the candidacy of Prince James Sobieski, but the majority of the nobility at the election in 1697 was in the favour of the Saxon Elector Frederick Augustus I, later crowned as Augustus II. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Ma≈Ça Encyklopedia Wojskowa, 1967, Wydanie I ==External links== * by Rafal Heydel-Mankoo Category:Secular senators of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth Category:Castellans of Krak√≥w Category:Polish people of the Russo-Polish War (1654‚Äì1667) Category:1634 births Category:1702 deaths Category:Ruthenian nobility of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth Stanislaw Jan Category:People of the Great Turkish War Category:Field Crown Hetmans Category:Great Crown Hetmans ","title":"Stanis≈Çaw Jan Jab≈Çonowski"},{"id":"1269214","text":"Carpet Museum of Iran, Tehran Located in Tehran, beside Laleh Park, and founded in 1976, the Carpet Museum of Iran exhibits a variety of Persian carpets from all over Iran, dating from the 16th century to the present.

After the war, he studied medicine and eventually reached the rank of chief doctor in the University gynaecological clinic. He joined the Nazi party in 1933 and later was appointed professor of gynaecology at the University of K√∂nigsberg. He carried out research on female fertility hormones (particularly progesterone) and their application as infertility treatments, obtaining a Habilitation for this work in 1937.Robert Jay Lifton, \\"The Nazi doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide\\", Basic Books, 2000, ; pp. 271‚Äì278 of the online edition and references there, http://www.holocaust-history.org/lifton/LiftonT271.shtml He received the rank of SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer of the Reserve.Robert Jay Lifton: √Ñrzte im Dritten Reich, Klett-Cotta, Stuttgart 1988, S. 312. ==Human experiments at Auschwitz== In 1942 he approached Heinrich Himmler, who knew of him through treatment of a senior SS officer's wife and asked him for an opportunity to perform mass sterilizations on women for his experiments. Himmler agreed, and in December 1942 Clauberg moved to Auschwitz concentration camp. His laboratory was in a part of the Block 10 in the main camp. Clauberg's goal was to find an easy and cheap method to sterilize women. He injected formaldehyde preparations into their uteruses‚Äîwithout anesthetics. His test subjects were Jewish and Romani women who suffered permanent damage and serious infections. Some of the subjects died because of the tests. Estimates of those who were sterilized are around 700. Himmler wanted to know how much time it would take to sterilize 1000 Jewish women in that way. Clauberg's answer was satisfactory: One doctor with 10 assistants should be able to conduct sterilization of a few hundred, or even a few thousand, Jews in one day. ==POW, 1945‚Äì1955== When the Red Army approached the camp, Clauberg moved to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp to continue his experiments on Romani women. Soviet troops captured him there in 1945. After the war in 1948, Clauberg was put on trial in the Soviet Union and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. In 1955, he was released (but not pardoned) by the Soviet Union under the Adenauer-Bulganin prisoner exchange agreement, with the final group of about 10,000 POWs and civilian internees., ==Medical career, arrest and death, 1955‚Äì1957== He returned to West Germany, where he was reinstated at his former clinic based on his prewar scientific output. Bizarre behavior, including openly boasting of his \\"achievements\\" in \\"developing a new sterilization technique at the Auschwitz concentration camp\\", destroyed any chance he might have had of staying unnoticed. In 1955, after public outcry from groups of survivors, Clauberg was arrested and put on trial. He died before trial on August 9, 1957 in Kiel Germany. == Clauberg test == The Clauberg test is an obsolete bioassay to assess progestational activity based on the conversion of proliferative endometrium to secretory endometrium in immature rabbits. ==See also== * Block 10 * Josef Mengele ==References== == Bibliography == * Ernst Klee: Auschwitz, die NS-Medizin und ihre Opfer. 3.

Eduard Sch√∂nfeld (December 22, 1828May 1, 1891) was a German astronomer. ==Education== Sch√∂nfeld was born at Hildburghausen, in the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, where he had a distinguished career at the gymnasium. On leaving the gymnasium, he desired to devote himself to astronomy, but abandoned the idea in deference to his father's wishes. He went first to Hanover, and afterwards to Kassel to study architecture, for which he seems to have had little inclination. 1849 found him studying chemistry under Bunsen at Marburg, where his love for astronomy was revived by Gerling's lectures. In 1851 he visited the Bonn Observatory and studied astronomy under Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander. In 1853 he was appointed assistant, and in the following year won a doctor's degree with his treatise Nova elementa Thetidis. At Bonn he took an important part in preparing the Durchmusterung of the northern heavens. He took up the investigation of the light-changes in variable stars, devoting to this work nights which, on account of moonlight, were unsuitable for zone observations. The results of these researches were published in the Sitz. Berich. Wien. Akad. vol. xlii. ==Mannheim Observatory== For a short time he was a Privatdozent at Bonn, but in 1859 he was appointed director of the Mannheim Observatory. The instrumental equipment of that observatory was somewhat antiquated, his largest telescope being a small refractor of 73 lines aperture, but he selected a line of work to suit the instruments at his disposal, observing nebulae and variable stars and keeping a watch on comets and new planets. The results of his observations of nebulae are contained in two catalogues published in the Astronomische Beobachtungen der Grossherzoglichen Sternwarte zu Mannheim, 1st and 2nd parts (1862 and 1875), and those of his variable star observations appeared in the Jahresberichte des Mannheimer Vereins f√ºr Naturkunde, Nos. 32 and 39 (1866 and 1875). ==Bonn Observatory== On the death of Argelander, which occurred on February 17, 1875, Sch√∂nfeld was appointed to succeed him as director of the Bonn Observatory, and soon after his appointment he began his last and greatest piece of work, the extension, on Argelander's plan, of the survey of the heavens down to 23 degrees of south declination. The experience gained on the northern survey under Argelander's direction enabled Sch√∂nfeld to introduce some improvements in the methods employed, which increased the accuracy of this work, which was practically accomplished in March 1881, some revision only remaining to be done. These zone observations afforded 363,932 separate places of stars, and form the groundwork of the catalogue of 133,659 stars between 2 and 23 degrees south declination, which was published in 1886 as the eighth volume of the Bonn observations. ==Affiliations== Sch√∂nfeld was a member of the Astronomische Gesellschaft from its foundation in 1863, being a member of council up to 1869, and in 1875 becoming editor of its publications and secretary in conjunction with Winnecke. In 1878 he was elected a Foreign Associate of the Royal Astronomical Society. ==Legacy== Minor planet 5926 Sch√∂nfeld is named in his honor. ==Notes== ==References== * Category:1828 births Category:1891 deaths Category:German astronomers Category:Members of the Prussian Academy of Sciences Category:People from Saxe-Meiningen Category:University of Hanover alumni Category:University of Marburg alumni Category:University of Bonn faculty Category:People from Hildburghausen ","title":"Eduard Sch√∂nfeld"},{"id":"1269227","text":"Heteromyidae is a family of rodents consisting of kangaroo rats, kangaroo mice, pocket mice and spiny pocket mice. Most heteromyids live in complex burrows within the deserts and grasslands of western North America, though species within the genus Heteromys are also found in forests and their range extends down as far as northern South America. They feed mostly on seeds and other plant parts, which they carry in their fur-lined cheek pouches to their burrows. Although they are very different in physical appearance, the closest relatives of the heteromyids are pocket gophers in the family Geomyidae. ==Description== There are about fifty-nine members of the family Heteromyidae divided among six genera. They are all small rodents, the largest being the giant kangaroo rat (Dipodomys ingens) with a body length of and a tail a little longer than this. In many species the tail is tufted and is mainly used for balance. Other adaptations include partially fused vertebrae in the neck, short fore limbs and much enlarged bullae (bubble-shaped bones in the skull). The skulls vary widely across the group but they are all thin and papery and do not have the robust cranial crests and ridges found on the skulls of members of the family Geomyidae. The skull has other peculiarities. There is an extra hole that penetrates the rostrum, distinctive occluded teeth and the masseter muscle, which moves the lower jaw, is set far forward on the snout, an arrangement found in squirrels, beavers, pocket gophers, heteromyids and a few other groups. The dental formula is teeth in total. In the kangaroo rats, the teeth continue to grow all the time, being worn away as the animal chews. The molars have two-lobed cusps. The upper incisors are grooved and the enamel on the molars is quickly worn away by chewing leaving the dentine exposed. In the kangaroo rats they are unrooted but in the pocket mice they have roots. Fur-lined cheek pouches are a feature across the family Heteromyidae. They have openings near the mouth and extend backwards along the sides of the neck. The fur on the animal's body is in general short and fine and often matches in colour the soil of the region in which the animal lives, being some shade of buff, pale brown, reddish-brown or grey. The spiny pocket mice have coarser fur and spiky bristles on the back near the tail. ==Distribution== Heteromyids are endemic to the western United States, Mexico, Central America and northwestern South America. They are creatures of open country, mostly specialising in prairies, arid lands and desert fringes, but the spiny pocket mice are found in both wet and dry tropical forests in Central and northwestern South America. During the Oligocene, the extent of arid lands across the United States was greater than it is today and these animals occurred more widely. Fossils of kangaroo rats are known from the Pliocene. ==Behaviour== The kangaroo rats, kangaroo mice and pocket mice are adapted for life in deserts and other arid environments where they largely feed on dry seeds. Kangaroo rats have no need to drink because they are able to extract sufficient water from metabolising their food, obtaining half a gram of water from each gram of seeds eaten. They carry most of the seeds they find back to their burrows in exterior cheek folds lined with fur rather than in cheek pouches inside the mouth as do hamsters. This is because carrying the food in the mouth would involve wetting it and moisture needs to be conserved as much as possible in dry environments. Most species store the seeds they gather in special chambers in the burrow where they absorb moisture from the humid air. Others, such as Merriam's kangaroo rat, bury them in shallow caches in the open air. It has been found that there is little hoarding done in the winter but that food is most commonly stored in the autumn and spring. Heteromyds use sight and olfactory clues to locate possible food and then use their fore-feet to manipulate objects. Kangaroo mice make greater use of clumped food where wind or water has concentrated seeds in shallow depressions or around rocks while pocket mice hunt around under vegetation or debris for individual food items. It has been found that pocket mice forage more efficiently than kangaroo rats and this is thought to be due to the fact that they handle their finds more and are better able to distinguish between food and non-food items. These animals excavate long burrow systems with passages, chambers and multiple entrances. They are largely nocturnal, feeding and moving about at night and resting deep in their burrows during the day. Here it is cooler and more humid which conserves moisture and the animals may temporarily block the entrances to augment this. They are able to concentrate their urine to a viscous consistency which further reduces water loss. Under extreme conditions, some are able to aestivate in chambers under ground. Kangaroo rats have large hind feet with long metatarsals and no first digits. With these they bound around not using their fore feet at all for locomotion. Pocket mice are smaller and can also move with leaps but they normally run around on four limbs. Members of the genus Heteromys, the spiny pocket mice, move around on all fours and do not leap at all. ==Ecology== Kangaroo rats and pocket mice form a part of the diet of many predatory creatures. They are eaten by foxes, coyotes, snakes and birds. They have acute hearing and can detect the approaching swoop of an owl or the movements of a snake. Many can leap to avoid the predators as they seek the safety of their burrows. The largest kangaroo rats can leap in a single bound. In the Sonoran Desert there are many closely related species of heteromyid mice and rats. Each has its own niche in the environment which means that they do not unnecessarily compete with each other for the limited available resources. Bailey's pocket mouse climbs into plants and bushes in order to find seeds and berries still attached to the plant.

The facility includes two transmission towers. The old tower was built between 1936 and 1937. It is 53 metres high (including its antenna mast, which no longer exists, it had a height of 95 metres) and has an observation deck, which can be reached by elevator. This tower was intended to be used after 1939 for TV transmissions to central Germany, but due to the beginning of World War II, it was transformed into a radar facility. Unlike most modern TV towers, the old tower looks like a block of flats with a square cross section. The arrangement of the windows in the observation deck is similar to those in the restaurant in the Radio tower Berlin. In 1973 a new TV tower was built on Brocken. This 123-meter, freestanding steel-tube tower stands on three legs, which hold shafts for cable and stairways for personnel access. Above the legs are three decks for directional radio transmission aerials. The new TV tower is not accessible to the public. While Germany was divided into East and West, the Brocken transmitter was used for TV and FM-transmissions, even though it lay in the restricted area of the east-west frontier (on the Eastern Side). Its location so close to the border enabled it to be received in parts of the West. In the first half of the 1990s the transmitting aerial of the old tower was removed and replaced by a radome holding air traffic control radar equipment.

Therefore, the information flow is only in one direction, and it is not until the end of the chain that errors, changes and corrections can be relayed to the start of the sequence, causing estimated costs to be under predicted. This can cause many problems; such as time consumption due to many modifications being made as each stage does not take into account the next. This method is hardly used today, as the concept of concurrent engineering is more efficient. Traditional engineering is also known as over the wall engineering as each stage blindly throws the development to the next stage over the wall. ==Lean manufacturing== Traditional manufacturing has been driven by sales forecasts that companies need to produce and stockpile inventory to support. Lean manufacturing is based on the concept that production should be driven by the actual customer demands and requirements. Instead of pushing product to the marketplace, it is pulled through by the customers' actual needs. ==Sequential engineering stages== # Research # Design # Manufacture # Quality Control # Distribution # Sales ==Disadvantages of sequential engineering== # This orderly step-by-step process will bring control to complex projects but is very slow. # In today‚Äôs highly competitive market place this can lead to product failures and lost sales. ==See also== *Waterfall model ==References== Category:Engineering concepts Category:Product management Category:Supply chain management ","title":"Traditional engineering"},{"id":"1269246","text":"Concurrent engineering (CE) is a work methodology emphasizing the parallelization of tasks (i.e. performing tasks concurrently), which is sometimes called simultaneous engineering or integrated product development (IPD) using an integrated product team approach. It refers to an approach used in product development in which functions of design engineering, manufacturing engineering, and other functions are integrated to reduce the time required to bring a new product to market. ==Introduction== A 2008 publication described concurrent engineering as a new design management system that has matured in recent years to become a well-defined systems approach to optimizing design and engineering cycles.Ma, Y., Chen, G. & Thimm, G.; \\"Paradigm Shift: Unified and Associative Feature-based Concurrent Engineering and Collaborative Engineering\\", Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, Concurrent engineering has been implemented in a number of companies, organizations, and universities, most notably in the aerospace industry. Beginning in the early 1990s, CE was also adapted for use in the information and content automation field, providing a basis for organization and management of projects outside the physical product development sector for which it was originally designed. Organizations such as the European Space Agency's Concurrent Design Facility make use of concurrent design to perform feasibility studies for future missions. The basic premise for concurrent engineering revolves around two concepts. The first is the idea that all elements of a product's life- cycle‚Äîfrom functionality, production, assembly, testing, maintenance, environmental impact, and finally disposal and recycling‚Äîshould be taken into careful consideration in the early design phases.Kusiak, Andrew; Concurrent Engineering: Automation, Tools and Techniques The second concept is that design activities should all be occurring at the same time, i.e., concurrently. The idea is that the concurrent nature of these activities significantly increases productivity and product quality.Quan, W. & Jianmin, H., A Study on Collaborative Mechanism for Product Design in Distributed Concurrent Engineering IEEE 2006. DOI: 10.1109/CAIDCD.2006.329445 This way, errors and redesigns can be discovered early in the design process when the project is still flexible. By locating and fixing these issues early, the design team can avoid what often become costly errors as the project moves to more complicated computational models and eventually into the actual manufacturing of hardware.Kusiak, Andrew, Concurrent Engineering: Automation, Tools and Techniques As mentioned above, part of the design process is to ensure that the product's entire life cycle is taken into consideration. This includes establishing user requirements, propagating early conceptual designs, running computational models, creating physical prototypes, and eventually manufacturing the product. Included in this process is taking into full account funding, workforce capability, and time requirements. A 2006 study claimed that a correct implementation of the concurrent design process can save a significant amount of money, and that organizations have been moving to concurrent design for this reason. It is also highly compatible with systems thinking and green engineering. Concurrent engineering replaces the more traditional sequential design flow, or \\"Waterfall Model\\".\\"The standard waterfall model for systems development\\", NASA Webpage, November 14, 2008Kock, N. and Nosek, J., \\"Expanding the Boundaries of E-Collaboration\\", IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, Vol 48 No 1, March 2005. In Concurrent Engineering an iterative or integrated development method is used instead.Ma, Y., Chen, G., Thimm, G., \\"Paradigm Shift: Unified and Associative Feature-based Concurrent Engineering and Collaborative Engineering\\", Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, The Waterfall method moves in a linear fashion, starting with user requirements and sequentially moving forward to design and implementation, until you have a finished product. In this design system, a design team would not quickly look backward or forward from the step it is on to fix or anticipate problems. In the case that something does go wrong, the design usually must be scrapped or heavily altered. The concurrent or iterative design process encourages prompt changes of tack, so that all aspects of the life cycle of the product are taken into account, allowing for a more evolutionary approach to design.Royce, Winston, \\"Managing the Development of Large Software Systems\\", Proceedings of IEEE WESCON 26 (August 1970): 1-9. The difference between the two design processes can be seen graphically in Figure 1. Traditional \\"Waterfall\\" or Sequential Development Method vs. Iterative Development Method in concurrent engineering. A significant part of the concurrent design method is that the individual engineer is given much more say in the overall design process due to the collaborative nature of concurrent engineering. Giving the designer ownership is claimed to improve the productivity of the employee and quality of the product, based on the assumption that people who are given a sense of gratification and ownership over their work tend to work harder and design a more robust product, as opposed to an employee that is assigned a task with little say in the general process. ===Challenges associated with concurrent design=== Concurrent design comes with a series of challenges, such as implementation of early design reviews, dependency on efficient communication between engineers and teams, software compatibility, and opening up the design process.Kusiak, Andrew, \\"Concurrent Engineering: Automation, Tools and Techniques\\" This design process usually requires that computer models (computer aided design, finite element analysis) are exchanged efficiently, something that can be difficult in practice. If such issues are not addressed properly, concurrent design may not work effectively.Rosenblatt, A. and Watson, G. (1991). \\"Concurrent Engineering\\", IEEE Spectrum, July, pp 22-37. It is important to note that although the nature of some project activities project imposes a degree of linearity‚Äîcompletion of software code, prototype development and testing, for example‚Äîorganizing and managing project teams to facilitate concurrent design can still yield significant benefits that come from the improved sharing of information. Service providers exist that specialize in this field, not only training people how to perform concurrent design effectively, but also providing the tools to enhance the communication between the team members. ==Elements== ===Cross-functional teams=== Cross- functional teams include people from different area of the workplace that are all involved in a particular process, including manufacturing, hardware and software design, marketing, and so forth. ===Concurrent product realization=== Doing several things at once, such as designing various subsystems simultaneously, is critical to reducing design time and is at the heart of concurrent engineering. ===Incremental information sharing=== Incremental information sharing helps minimize the chance that concurrent product realization will lead to surprises. \\"Incremental\\" meaning that as soon as new information becomes available, it is shared and integrated into the design. Cross-functional teams are important to the effective sharing of information in a timely fashion. ===Integrated project management=== Integrated project management ensures that someone is responsible for the entire project, and that responsibility is not abdicated once one aspect of the work is done. ==Definition== Several definitions of concurrent engineering are in use. The first one is used by the Concurrent Design Facility (ESA): The second one is by Winner, et al., 1988: ==Using C.E.== Currently, several companies, agencies and universities use CE.

After studying law at Vienna, in 1829 Schmerling entered the public service, and during the next eighteen years was constantly occupied, chiefly in Lower Austria. In 1847, as a member of the lesser nobility, he entered the Estates of Lower Austria and took an active part in the Liberal movement for administrative and constitutional reform of which they were the center. On the outbreak of the revolution in Vienna in March 1848, when the mob broke into the Assembly, Schmerling was one of the deputation which carried to the palace the demands of the people, and during the next few days he was much occupied in organizing the newly formed National Guard. At the end of the month he was sent by the ministry to Frankfurt as one of the men of public confidence. He soon succeeded Count Colloredo as president of the Confederate Diet, and in this capacity officially transferred to Archduke John, who had been elected regent of Germany, the powers of the Diet on 12 July 1848. For this he was violently attacked in the National Assembly by the extreme Radicals; but on this and other occasions (he had himself been elected to the National Assembly) he defended himself effectively because he depended not on eloquence but on a recognition of what has been called the irony of facts to which the parliament as a whole was so blind. Schmerling was the first and the most influential member of the ministry which the Regent formed; from 15 July he held the ministry of the interior and foreign affairs, and it was almost entirely due to him that, at least for while, this phantom government maintained some appearance of power and dignity. With the resignation of Prince Carl zu Leiningen on 5 September 1848, the Regent requested Schmerling to form a new ministry after Frederick Dahlmann had failed to do so. A defeat in the parliament when he defended the armistice of Malm√∂ led to his resignation; but he was immediately called to office again, with practically dictatorial power, in order to quell the revolt which broke out in Frankfurt on September 18. His courage and resolution averted what nearly became a terrible catastrophe. It was his hope to establish in Germany the supremacy of a Liberal and reformed Austria. This brought him into opposition to the party of Prussian supremacy; and when they attained a majority, he resigned, and was succeeded by Heinrich von Gagern. He remained at Frankfurt, holding the post of Austrian envoy, and was the leader of the (the party supporting the idea of Greater Germania) until the dissolution of the Kremsier Parliament showed that the forces of reaction had conquered at Vienna and shattered all hopes of Austria attaining the position he had hoped for her. After the abortive election of king Frederick William IV of Prussia to be emperor, he, with the other Austrians, were ordered to leave Frankfurt by the Austrian government on 5 April 1849. On his return to Vienna he became minister of justice, and the reforms which he carried out added to his reputation. His popularity among all Liberals was increased by his resignation in 1851, as a protest against the failure of the government to establish the constitution they had promised. During the-next few years he was judge of the supreme court of appeal. When his forecast was fulfilled, and the system of absolutism broke down, he became minister in January 1862. His first act was the publication of the constitution by which the whole of the empire was to be organized as a single state with a parliamentary government. The experiment failed, chiefly because of the opposition of the Croatians and Magyars, whom he bitterly offended by his celebrated saying that Hungary could wait. Faults of manner, natural in a man whose life had been spent as an official and a judge, prevented him from keeping together the German Liberals as a strong and united party; he was opposed by a powerful faction at court, and by the Clerical leaders. After the first few months, emperor Franz Joseph I gave him only a very lukewarm support; and with his retirement in 1865 the attempt to carry out the ideals of Joseph II to Germanize while he liberalized the whole of the empire, and to compel Hungarians, Poles, Czechs and Croatians to accept a system in which the government of the whole should be carried on by a German-speaking parliament and bureaucracy, failed. The constitution of 1862, though suspended on Schmerling's fall, was still regarded as legally valid for the Cisleithanian territories, and is the basis on which the present constitution for half the empire was framed. On his retirement he returned to his judicial duties; in 1867 he was made life-member of the Upper House (Herrenhaus) in the Reichsrat, of which he became vice-president, and in 1871 president. This post he laid down in 1879, and came forward as leader of the Liberal German opposition to the administration of Count Taaffe. In 1891 he retired from public life, and died at Vienna on May 23, 1893. In 1835 Schmerling married , a daughter of field marshal lieutenant Freiherr von Koudelka. She was distinguished by her literary and artistic abilities, at that time rare in the Austrian capital, but she died young in 1840, leaving two daughters. ==Notes== * * Arneth, Anton v.

Karl von Schmidt (January 12, 1817 ‚Äì August 25, 1875) was a Prussian cavalry general. == Life == Schmidt was born at Schwedt on the Oder in the Province of Brandenburg, and entered the 4th Ulans as a second lieutenant in 1834. Schmidt's long regimental service was varied by staff service and instructional work, and in the mobilization of 1859 he had the command of a landwehr cavalry regiment. In 1863 he was made colonel of the 4th Cuirassiers, which he commanded in the, for the cavalry arm, uneventful campaigns in the Second Schleswig War of 1864 and the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. He then commanded a newly raised regiment of Schleswig-Holstein troops, the 16th Hussars, but at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War he was still an obscure and perhaps a mistrusted officer, though his grasp of every detail of cavalry work was admitted. But an opportunity for distinction was grasped in the cavalry fighting around Mars-la-Tour (August 16), in which he temporarily led a brigade and was severely wounded. He was soon promoted major-general and succeeded to the temporary command of his division on the disablement of its leader. In this post Schmidt did brilliant work in the campaign on the Loire, and even in the winter operations towards Le Mans, and earned a reputation second to none amongst the officers and men of his arm. After the war he took a leading part in the reorganization of the Prussian cavalry, which in ten years raised its efficiency to a point far beyond that of any other cavalry in Europe. In 1875, though his health was failing, he refused to give up the conduct of certain important cavalry manoeuvres with which he had been entrusted. But a few days of heavy work in the field brought on a fatal illness, and he died at Danzig on the 25 August 1875. In 1889 the 4th Ulans, in which his regimental service was almost entirely spent, were given the name ‚Äúvon Schmidt‚Äù. Schmidt's drill and manoeuvre instructions were codified and published after his death by his staff officer, Captain von Vollard Bockelberg, who was authorized by Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia to do so. An English translation, Instructions for Cavalry, was published by the War Office. Schmidt himself wrote a pamphlet, Auch ein Wunder die Ausbildung der Cavallerie (1862). The original German edition of the Instructions for Cavalry is prefaced by a memoir of Schmidt's life and services, written by Major Kaehler. ==Notes== ==References== * Category:1817 births Category:1875 deaths Category:People from Schwedt Category:People from the Province of Brandenburg Category:German untitled nobility Category:Major generals of Prussia Category:Cavalry commanders Category:Prussian people of the Austro-Prussian War Category:German military personnel of the Franco- Prussian War ","title":"Karl von Schmidt"},{"id":"1269265","text":"Keith Joseph Bullock FTSE (1931‚Äì2015) was an engineer and academic at the University of Queensland. == Early life == Bullock was born in Brisbane, Queensland in 1931. He attended Moorooka State School and the Church of England Grammar School. Bullock enrolled in the engineering program at the University of Queensland in 1948, gaining his B.E. with first class honours in 1952. He won a number of prizes and the Alfred Henry Darker scholarship. == Career == Bullock was employed as a demonstrator after graduation. He commenced his PhD under supervisor Professor Mansergh Shaw. Bullock graduated with his PhD in 1957, the first engineering student to complete a PhD at the University of Queensland. His thesis studied the physical properties and milling of sugar cane with an aim to improve the costs and efficiency of machinery within sugar mills, particularly in Australia. His research was enabled by grants from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the Sugar Research Institute, and led to improvements in milling processes. Bullock married physiotherapist and fellow UQ graduate Margaret Roberts in 1957 and they moved to Boston, USA to take up a Fulbright Fellowship he was offered at Harvard University. He would pursue research there in addition to teaching graduate classes. Bullock continued his association with Harvard University as a guest lecturer. Bullock and his family returned to Australia in 1960, where he took a position as a lecturer at the University of Queensland in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Bullock pursued research in a number of areas including hybrid and electric transmissions for cars and heavy duty road vehicles to reduce fuel usage and emissions. In the 1970s he pioneered research into hybrid vehicles, converting a Ford Falcon to run on a small internal combustion engine with battery and flywheel energy storage, with Dr Duncan Gilmore. He and Dr Frank Grigg, worked on a re-design of power trains used in underground load haul dump vehicles. He produced designs for submarines, buses and freight train locomotives. He developed a number of power system design improvements. Bullock became Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering in 1975, and became Dean of Engineering in 1983. He encouraged the relocation of research into hypersonic test facilities to Queensland. Bullock retired from the university in 1991 and continued in private work for Transport Energy Systems, a company which he established the same year. Bullock died in 2015, and was survived by his wife Margaret and their two children. == Memberships and awards == * Member, American Society of Mechanical Engineering * Member, Society of Automotive Engineers of Australasia * Fellow, Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (including Chairman of Queensland branch) * Fellow, Institute of Engineers Australia * Rodda Award for outstanding work on a multi-purpose hybrid vehicle in 1982 * SAE Excellence Award (J.E.

He climbed eleven of the fourteen eight-thousand- metre peaks, many of them alone or by previously unclimbed routes, but disappeared during a solo attempt to make the first winter ascent of Makalu, the world's fifth highest mountain. Jean-Christophe Lafaille (left) and David Callaway at Shishapangma base camp ==Early career== Born in Gap, Hautes-Alpes, Lafaille's background was in sport climbing, and as a teenager he climbed extensively at C√©√ºse and played a part in turning it into one of the world's best known climbing venues. In 1989 he became the first Frenchman to solo a climb graded 7c+, and one of the first to climb 8c graded routes. In the early 1990s, Lafaille qualified as a mountain guide and began mountaineering in the Alps. He made a number of difficult ascents on the Mont Blanc massif, including the first solo climb of Divine Providence on the Grand Pilier d'Angle, one of the hardest routes on the massif. ==Self-rescue on Annapurna== The South Face of Annapurna On the strength of his climbs in the Alps, Lafaille was invited on an expedition to Annapurna by Pierre B√©ghin, one of the leading French climbers of the day. The pair attempted the mountain's vast South Face following the monsoon season in October 1992 in Alpine style, with no Sherpa support, pre-stocked campsites or fixed ropes on the upper mountain. They had reached a height of 7,400 metres when bad weather forced them to descend. The pair made a series of abseils down the face, but due to their lightweight approach they had little protective equipment and were often forced to abseil from a single anchor to conserve equipment. On the fourth or fifth abseil, B√©ghin fell to his death when the single cam he was using as an anchor became dislodged from the rock. B√©ghin had been carrying most of the pair's technical equipment, including all the ropes, and Lafaille was left alone on the face, a vertical mile above safety. With great difficulty, Lafaille managed to climb down the 75 degree face to the pair's last bivouac site, where he found 20 metres of thin rope, allowing him to make short abseils down some of the hardest parts. With no technical equipment to use as anchors he was forced to entrust his weight to tent pegs or, on one occasion, a plastic bottle. He finally reached what should have been the relative safety of the top of a fixed rope which he and Beghin had installed on a steep rock band, but almost immediately he was struck by a falling rock, which broke his right arm. Disabled and helpless, he lay on a ledge for two days in the hope that other climbers would rescue him. However, while there was a Slovenian team attempting a route on a different part of the South Face, they judged that a rescue attempt would be too dangerous to undertake, so help never came. The cruellest thing about the ordeal, Lafaille said, was being able to see life in the valley below, and by night, the flashbulbs of trekkers' cameras. In spite of this, he later agreed that the Slovenians had made the right decision in not trying to save him. Eventually, with all hope of rescue gone, Lafaille resolved to continue down alone. He initially tried to continue abseiling, but unable to control the rope with only one hand and his teeth he reverted to downclimbing one-handed, and was utterly exhausted when he reached the Slovenian team's base camp. By that time the climbers at the base of the mountain had given up hope for him, and his first wife, V√©ronique, had already been told that he had died. Reinhold Messner later said that the survival instinct he showed was of the sort which defines the best mountaineers. English translation available at http://www.ukclimbing.com/articles/page.php?id=181 ==Subsequent career== Les Drus, where Lafaille made his hardest Alpine climb After Annapurna, Lafaille resolved never to climb again, but during his long physical and psychological recovery he began scrambling in the foothills of the Alps, and eventually returned to extreme climbing. In the Alps he carried out an enchainment of nine north faces in fifteen days, skiing from mountain to mountain, and made the first ascent of the Lafaille Route on the Petit Dru, which at the time was considered the hardest route in the Alps, but his most important climbs were in the Himalaya. A year after his accident on Annapurna, he climbed Cho Oyu, and then in 1994 he climbed a new route, solo, on the north face of Shishapangma. It was the first of many solo ascents of 8000 meter peaks, including consecutive ascents of Gasherbrum I and Gasherbrum II in four days in 1996, and Manaslu in 2001. Annapurna remained an obsession for Lafaille, and he would later call his autobiography Prisoner of Annapurna. He returned to the mountain three times. The first time he made a solo attempt on the British line on the South Face, which failed due to poor snow conditions. In 1998 he returned to the same route with a larger team, but the expedition was abandoned when a team member was killed in an avalanche. He finally reached the summit in 2002 with Alberto I√±urrategi via the long, committing east ridge. By 2003 Lafaille had decided to try to climb all fourteen 8000-metre peaks; but unlike many of the mountaineers who take on this goal, he had no desire simply to climb them by well established routes, in large expeditions and with bottled oxygen. He preferred to continue trying to achieve new routes or solo ascents, or to climb in the more demanding winter season. In 2003 he climbed Nanga Parbat, Dhaulagiri (solo) and Broad Peak in a two-month period. The last of these nearly killed him when he fell into a crevasse and then developed high altitude pulmonary edema. He was rescued by Ed Viesturs and Denis Urubko. In December 2004 he made a solo ascent of Shishapangma. It was intended to be the first winter ascent of the mountain, but he reached the summit on 11 December which was seen as too early to be classed as a true winter ascent. By this point he had completed eleven of the fourteen peaks, and needed Everest, Kanchenjunga and Makalu to complete his goal. ==Death on Makalu== Makalu, scene of Jean-Christophe Lafaille's last climb Lafaille's last climb was one of his boldest. In December 2005 he began a solo attempt to climb Makalu (8462m), the only 8000-metre peak in Nepal not to have seen a winter ascent. It was a goal which would have been considered suicidal a few years previously, but for Lafaille the danger was an important part of the experience. He commented > \\"I find it fascinating that our planet still has areas where no modern > technology can save you, where you are reduced to your most basic - and > essential - self. This natural space creates demanding situations that can > lead to suffering and death, but also generate a wild interior richness. > Ultimately, there is no way of reconciling these contradictions. All I can > do it try to live within their margins, in the narrow boundary between joy > and horror. Everything on this earth is a balancing act.\\" Over four weeks in December and January, he hauled loads up the mountain, entirely alone above his advance base camp at 5300m, but was forced to retreat from the col at Makalu La by strong winds, which destroyed his tent and twice blew him into the air. However, after two weeks at base camp the weather improved, and on 24 January he set off up the mountain. His only means of communication was a satellite phone, which he used to speak to his wife several times a day. By the morning of the 27th he was camped on a small ledge around 1000m below the summit, and told his wife that he would try to reach the top that day. He was never heard from again. Alone on the mountain in winter, with no climbers in the world sufficiently acclimatised to reach his high camp, there was no possibility of a rescue attempt. His base camp team gave up hope of him returning alive after he had been missing for a week, and a later helicopter flight over the mountain failed to find any sign of him. His body has not been found and his exact fate is unknown. He left his wife, Katia, and two children. ==References== 10\\\\.

Fernald State School, later the Walter E. Fernald Developmental Center (aka Fernald Developmental Center or simply Fernald), was the Western hemisphere's oldest publicly funded institution serving people with developmental disabilities. Originally a Victorian sanatorium, it became a \\"poster child\\" for the American eugenics movement during the 1920s. It later was the scene of medical experiments in the 20th century. Investigations into this research led to new regulations regarding human research in children. The school occupies a property off Trapelo Road in Waltham, Massachusetts. ==History== ===Early history=== The Fernald Center, originally called the Experimental School for Teaching and Training Idiotic Children, was founded in Boston by reformer Samuel Gridley Howe in 1848 with a $2,500 appropriation from the Massachusetts State Legislature. The school gradually moved to a new permanent location in Waltham between 1888 and 1891. It would eventually comprise 72 buildings total, located on . At its peak, some 2,500 people were confined there, most of them \\"feeble-minded\\" boys. Under its third superintendent, Walter E. Fernald (1859‚Äì1924), an advocate of eugenics, the school was viewed as a model educational facility in the field of mental retardation. It was renamed in his honor in 1925, following his death the previous year. The institution was involved in several different procedures that used the residents as test subjects some of which include sterilization and radiation experimentation. The institution did serve a large population of children with cognitive disabilities (referred to as ‚Äúmentally retarded children‚Äù), but The Boston Globe estimates that upwards of half of the inmates tested with IQs in the normal range. In the 20th century, living conditions were spartan or worse; approximately 36 children slept in each dormitory room. There were also reports of physical and sexual abuse. ===Nuclear medicine research in children=== The Fernald School was the site of the 1946‚Äì53 joint experiments by Harvard University and MIT that exposed young male children to tracer doses of radioactive isotopes. Documents obtained in 1994 by the United States Department of Energy revealed the following details: *The experiment was conducted in part by a research fellow sponsored by the Quaker Oats Company. *MIT Professor of Nutrition Robert S. Harris led the experiment, which studied the absorption of calcium and iron. *The boys were encouraged to join a \\"Science Club\\", which offered larger portions of food, parties, and trips to Boston Red Sox baseball games. *The 57 club members ate iron-enriched cereals and calcium-enriched milk for breakfast. In order to track absorption, several radioactive calcium tracers were given orally or intravenously. *Radiation levels in stool and blood samples would serve as dependent variables. *In another study, 17 subjects received iron supplement shots containing radioisotopes of iron. *Neither the children nor their parents ever gave adequate informed consent for participation in a scientific study. The Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, reporting to the United States Department of Energy in 1994, reported on these experiments: > In 1946, one study exposed seventeen subjects to radioactive iron. The > second study, which involved a series of seventeen related subexperiments, > exposed fifty-seven subjects to radioactive calcium between 1950 and 1953. > It is clear that the doses involved were low and that it is extremely > unlikely that any of the children who were used as subjects were harmed as a > consequence. These studies remain morally troubling, however, for several > reasons. First, although parents or guardians were asked for their > permission to have their children involved in the research, the available > evidence suggests that the information provided was, at best, incomplete. > Second, there is the question of the fairness of selecting institutionalized > children at all, children whose life circumstances were by any standard > already heavily burdened. It has been claimed that the highest dose of radiation that any subject was exposed to was 330 millirem the equivalent of less than one year's background radiation in Denver. A 1995 class-action suit resulted in a 1998 District court decision awarding the victims a $1.85 million settlement from MIT and Quaker. The school also participated in studies of thyroid function in patients with Down Syndrome and their parents. This study showed that their iodine metabolism was similar to normal controls. ===Reform lawsuit=== This situation changed in the 1970s, when a class action suit, Ricci v. Okin, was filed to upgrade conditions at Fernald and several other state institutions for persons with mental retardation in Massachusetts. U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Louis Tauro, who assumed oversight of the case in 1972, formally disengaged from the case in 1993, declaring that improvements in the care and conditions at the facilities had made them \\"second to none anywhere in the world\\". A result for Fernald residents of the class action suit which took effect in 1993 was the provision of \\"a guaranteed level of care, regardless of cost, to compensate for decades of neglect and abuse\\". ===Twenty-first century=== The buildings and grounds survived into the 2000s as a center for mentally disabled adults, operated by the Massachusetts Department of Mental Retardation. In 2001, 320 adults resided at Fernald, with ages ranging from 27 to 96 years and an average age of 47 years. According to a December 13, 2004 article in the Boston Globe, Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney announced in 2003 that the facility would be closed and the land sold by 2007. In 2003, a coalition of family advocates and state employee unions began a campaign to save Fernald and asked Judge Tauro to resume his oversight of the \\"Ricci v. Okin\\" class action lawsuit that had led to improvements at Fernald and the other state facilities beginning in the 1970s. In an August 14, 2007 ruling, Judge Tauro ordered the Department of Mental Retardation to consider the individual wishes of all 185 institution residents before closing the facility. However, in September 2007, the new administration of Governor Deval Patrick appealed Tauro's ruling to the First Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston. In a statement, the Patrick administration contended that Fernald had become too expensive to continue to operate and that equal or better care could be provided in private, community-based settings for the remaining Fernald residents. The administration's cost claims have been disputed by the Fernald League for the Retarded, Inc., the Massachusetts Coalition of Families and Advocates for the Retarded, Inc. (COFAR) and other family-based organizations, which have continued to advocate for the preservation of Fernald as a site for ICF/MR-level care for its current residents. Those advocacy organizations have proposed a \\"postage-stamp\\" plan under which Fernald would be scaled back in size and the remaining portion of the campus sold for development. The Patrick administration, however, has declined to negotiate with those Fernald advocates, and has pressed ahead with its appeal and closure plans. A significant portion of the Waltham campus, encompassing its facilities established through Fernald's tenure, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Fernald was the subject of a 2005 documentary film \\"Front Wards, Back Wards\\" directed by W.C. Rogers, which has been shown on some PBS television stations. , Fernald remained open with 13 residents living on grounds, the oldest of whom was 84 years old and a resident since the age of 19. It was reported to cost approximately per client per year, or about four times the United States national average for state- supported institution. The Fernald Center's last resident was discharged on Thursday, November 13, 2014, after a protracted legal and political battle which cost the Commonwealth of Massachusetts over $40 million in additional costs over the projected closure date of 2010. Remaining residents were integrated into community services or other state-operated programs. The land was purchased by the city of Waltham, which is exploring the possibility of a new high school on the site. ==Current status== The state sold the property to the city of Waltham in 2014 for $3.7 million, retaining some rights to profit from future leases. and with some historical preservation conditions. As of 2019, despite considering use of the property as a high school or police station, it remains vacant. ==See also== *Human experimentation in the United States *Templeton Developmental Center, another state facility originally established under Fernald's tenure *National Register of Historic Places listings in Waltham, Massachusetts *Metropolitan State Hospital (Massachusetts), the state hospital located across the street at 475 Trapelo Road *Wrentham State School, Massachusetts' last remaining large scale institution for the developmentally disabled *Belchertown State School, a similar state institution that existed from 1922-1992 and was built to alleviate overcrowding at Wrentham and Fernald. ==References== ==Further reading== *D'Antonio, Michael.

At an early age he was engaged at the Royal Theatre, Berlin, where he soon rose to play leading comedy parts. His reputation as a comedian grew with his success in such roles as Zierl in the Einfahrt vom Lande, Peter in the Kapellmeister von Venedig, Schikaneder in his own revision of Mozart's Der Schauspieldirektor and Basilio in Le Nozze di Figaro, and he became the favourite of Berlin. In 1845 he was appointed head of the Royal opera in Berlin. The same year he adapted Mozart's singspiel Der Schauspieldirektor, replacing Gottlieb Stephanie's libretto with his own which included the characters of Mozart, Emmanuel Schikaneder, Mozart's sister-in-law Aloysia Lange among others.

The edition is Les Aventures du Capitaine Hatteras au P√¥le Nord, type \\"Aux deux √©l√©phants\\". Pierre-Jules Hetzel (January 15, 1814 ‚Äì March 17, 1886) was a French editor and publisher. He is best known for his extraordinarily lavishly illustrated editions of Jules Verne's novels, highly prized by collectors today. ==Biography== Born in Chartres, Eure-et-Loir, Hetzel studied law in Strasbourg, and founded a publishing company in 1837. He was the publisher of Honor√© de Balzac, whose Com√©die humaine began to be appear in 1841, and of Victor Hugo and √âmile Zola. In 1843, he founded the Nouveau magazine des enfants (\\"New Children's Magazine\\"). Hetzel was a well-known republican, and in 1848 he became chief of cabinet for Alphonse de Lamartine (then minister of Foreign Affairs), and afterward for the minister of the Navy. He went into self-imposed exile in Belgium after the coup d'√©tat which ushered in the Second Empire, and there he continued his political and editorial activities, notably by clandestinely publishing Hugo's Les Ch√¢timents, a harsh pamphlet against the Second Empire. When the political regime was changed in France, he returned home and published Proudhon and Baudelaire. An important edition of the tales by Charles Perrault, illustrated by Gustave Dor√©, dates from this period. He founded the Biblioth√®que illustr√©e des Familles (\\"The Family Illustrated Library\\"), which was renamed to Le Magasin d'√©ducation et de r√©cr√©ation (\\"Education and Entertainment Magazine\\") in 1864. His goal was to have scientists, authors and illustrators collaborating to create educational works for the whole family. Hetzel's fame comes mostly for his editions of the Voyages extraordinaires (\\"Extraordinary Journeys\\") by Jules Verne. The stories were originally published in biweekly chapters as a series in his Magasin. Once all chapters of a story were printed there, the story would appear in book form. Typically this happened towards the end of the year so the books could be purchased as Christmas presents for older children. Originally, there were three editions: one economical, without illustrations; another one in small format, with a few illustrations; and a third one in a bigger in-octavo format and richly illustrated. It is the last edition that is now very popular among book collectors. Hetzel discovered Jules Verne, but scholars still debate to what extent Hetzel \\"made\\" Verne, or if it was Verne who \\"made\\" Hetzel's publishing career. Each benefited from the other, and their relationship went beyond that of author and publisher. Hetzel rejected Verne's 1863 manuscript for Paris in the Twentieth Century because he thought it presented a vision of the future that was far too negative and unbelievable for contemporary audiences, though to many present-day scholars the story was remarkably accurate in its predictions. Verne locked the manuscript away and no longer wrote futuristic, dystopian stories. Paris in the Twentieth Century was first published in France in 1994. Hetzel was an atheist. Writing under the pseudonym P.-J. Stahl, he was the author of many stories for children and young people. He died in Monte Carlo in 1886. After Hetzel's death, the publishing business was directed by his son and was later purchased by Hachette in 1914. ==See also== For more examples of the pictures featured in the books: * Captain Nemo * Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas * Nautilus ==References== ==External links== *Les Cartonages Hetzel (in French).

It was patented in 1990 and approved for medical use in 1997. ==Medical uses== ===Hypertension=== As with other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, candesartan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Candesartan has an additive hypertensive effect when combined with a diuretic, such as chlortalidone. It is available in a combination formulation with a low dose of the thiazide diuretic hydrochlorothiazide. Candesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination preparations are marketed under various trade names including Atacand HCT, Hytacand, Blopress Plus, Advantec and Ratacand Plus. ===Congestive heart failure=== Results from the CHARM study (early 2000s) demonstrated the morbidity and mortality reduction benefits of candesartan therapy in congestive heart failure. ===Prehypertension=== In a four-year randomized controlled trial, candesartan was compared to placebo to see whether it could prevent or postpone the development of full-blown hypertension in people with so-called prehypertension. During the first two years of the trial, half of participants were given candesartan, and the others received placebo; candesartan reduced the risk of developing hypertension by nearly two-thirds during this period. In the last two years of the study, all participants were switched to placebo. By the end of the study, candesartan had significantly reduced the risk of hypertension, by more than 15%. Serious adverse effects were more common among participants receiving placebo than in those given candesartan. ===Prevention of atrial fibrillation=== A meta-analysis found that candesartan reduces risk of atrial fibrillation in persons with systolic left ventricular dysfunction or with left ventricular hypertrophy.Healey, Jeff S., Adrian Baranchuk, Eugene Crystal, Carlos A. Morillo, Michael Garfinkle, Salim Yusuf, and Stuart J. Connolly. \\"Prevention of atrial fibrillation with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers: a meta-analysis.\\" Journal of the American College of Cardiology 45, no. 11 (2005): 1832-1839. (This was also true of other angiotensin receptor blockers and of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). ===Diabetic retinopathy=== Use of antihypertensive drugs, including candesartan, in patients with diabetic retinopathy, has been demonstrated to slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy. ===Migraine prophylaxis=== Candesartan is effective for prophylaxis of migraine. ==Adverse effects== As with other drugs that inhibit the renin‚Äìangiotensin system, if candesartan is taken by pregnant women during the second or third trimester, it can cause injury and in some cases, death of the developing fetus. Symptomatic hypotension may occur in people who take candesartan and are volume-depleted or salt-depleted, as can also occur when diuretics are coadministered. Reduction in renal glomerular filtration rate may occur; people with renal artery stenosis may be at higher risk. Hyperkalemia may occur; people who are also taking spironolactone or eplerenone may be at higher risk. For label updates see FDA index page for IND 020838 Anemia may occur, due to inhibition of the renin‚Äìangiotensin system. As with other angiotensin receptor blockers, candesartan can rarely cause severe liver injury. right ==Chemistry and pharmacokinetics== Candesartan is marketed as the cyclohexyl 1-hydroxyethyl carbonate (cilexetil) ester, known as candesartan cilexetil. Candesartan cilexetil is metabolised completely by esterases in the intestinal wall during absorption to the active candesartan moieity. The use of a prodrug form increases the bioavailability of candesartan. Despite this, absolute bioavailability is relatively poor at 15% (candesartan cilexetil tablets) to 40% (candesartan cilexetil solution). Its IC50 is 15 Œºg/kg. ==History== The compound known as TCV-116 (candesartan) was studied by Japanese scientists using standard laboratory rats. Animal studies were published showing the effectiveness of the compound in 1992‚Äì1993, with a pilot study on humans published in the summer of 1993. ==Names== The prodrug candesartan cilexetil is marketed by AstraZeneca and Takeda Pharmaceuticals, commonly under the trade names Blopress, Atacand, Amias, and Ratacand. It is available in generic form. ==References== Category:Angiotensin II receptor antagonists Category:Tetrazoles Category:Benzimidazoles Category:Ethers Category:Carboxylic acids Category:Biphenyls Category:AstraZeneca brands Category:Takeda Pharmaceutical Company brands ","title":"Candesartan"},{"id":"1269325","text":"Abraham Mapu Abraham Mapu (1808 in Vilijampolƒó, Kaunas1867 in K√∂nigsberg, Prussia) was a Lithuanian novelist. He wrote in Hebrew as part of the Haskalah (enlightenment) movement. His novels, with their lively plots encompassing heroism, adventure and romantic love in Biblical settings, contributed to the rise of the Zionist movement. ==Biography== Born into a Jewish family, as a child Mapu studied in a cheder where his father served as a teacher. He married in 1825. For many years he was an impoverished, itinerant schoolmaster. Mapu gained financial security when he was appointed teacher in a government school for Jewish children. He worked as a teacher in various towns and cities, joined the Haskalah movement, and studied German, French and Russian. He also studied Latin from a translation of the Bible to that language, given him by his local rabbi. Statue of Abraham Mapu in Kaunas He returned in 1848 to Kaunas and self-published his first historical novel, Ahavat Zion. This is considered one of the first Hebrew novels. He began work on it in 1830 but completed it only in 1853. Unable to fully subsist on his book sales, he relied on the support of his brother, Matisyahu. In 1867 he moved to K√∂nigsberg due to illness, published his last book, Amon Pedagogue (Amon means something like Mentor), and died there. ==Evaluation== Mapu is considered the first Hebrew novelist. Influenced by French Romanticism, he wrote intricately plotted stories about life in ancient Israel, which he contrasted favorably with 19th-century Jewish life. His style is fresh and poetic, almost Biblical in its simple grandeur. ==Legacy== The romantic- nationalistic ideas in his novels later inspired David Ben-Gurion and others active in the leadership of the modern Zionist movement that led to the establishment of the state of Israel. The American Hebrew poet, Gabriel Preil, references Mapu in one of his works, and focuses on the two writers' native Lithuania.

A well-known Israeli novel called \\"The Children from Mapu Street\\" (\\"◊î◊ô◊ú◊ì◊ô◊ù ◊û◊®◊ó◊ï◊ë ◊û◊ê◊§◊ï\\") also celebrates his name. In Kaunas A. Mapu street a joyful statue of A.

As a child he took piano and baritone horn lessons. He later said in an interview that he would have preferred violin lessons, but the violin had to be rented and the baritone horn was available free of charge. In high school he played the tuba, as well as the guitar and the banjo, and sang in the church choir. In 1965‚Äì66 he attended Boston University, where he studied acting. In Boston he met Walter Powers and Willie Alexander of the Grass Managerie. In 1966‚Äì67, he played with the Grass Managerie and other bands in New York, California, and Boston. ===The Velvet Underground=== ====1968‚Äì1970==== Yule first met the Velvet Underground at his River Street apartment in Boston, which he rented from their road manager, Hans Onsager, and where the band would sometimes stay when they played in the city. Yule's improving guitar technique caught the ear of Sterling Morrison.Jovanovic, pp. 126‚Äì27 When John Cale left the Velvet Underground at the behest of Lou Reed in 1968, Yule joined the band (then consisting of Reed, Morrison and Maureen \\"Moe\\" Tucker) as Cale's replacement. Yule made his first studio appearance on their third album, The Velvet Underground (1969), playing bass and organ. As well as singing lead vocals on the ballad \\"Candy Says\\", which opens the album, he harmonizes with Reed on \\"Jesus\\" and co-sings the chorus of the album's penultimate track, \\"The Murder Mystery\\", with Maureen Tucker. His contribution to the LP was considerable, and his vocals would later come in handy on the road. When Reed's voice became strained from touring, Yule would sing lead on several songs. While Cale had been a more experimental bass player, Yule was considered more technically proficient on the instrument and his distinct melodic style suited Reed's desire to move the band into a more mainstream direction. His lead vocals can be heard on the song \\"She's My Best Friend\\" which was recorded in 1969 and later appeared on the outtakes compilation VU, and on the band's fourth album, Loaded (1970), Yule's role became even more prominent, singing the lead vocals on several songs on the LP (\\"Who Loves the Sun\\", \\"New Age\\", \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\", and \\"Oh! Sweet Nuthin'\\"), and playing six instruments (including keyboard and drums). Yule's brother Billy also joined in on the sessions as a drummer, as regular drummer Maureen Tucker was pregnant and therefore absent for most of the recording. His lead vocals can also be heard on the song \\"Ride Into the Sun\\", which was featured on the Fully Loaded CD reissue of Loaded that was released in 1997. ====1970‚Äì73 (Loaded tour and final Velvet Underground shows)==== Lou Reed left the Velvet Underground during their summer residency at the New York club Max's Kansas City in August 1970. With band manager Steve Sesnick looking to fill pending bookings, and with the upcoming release of Loaded in November of that year, Yule, Tucker and Morrison decided to continue performing as the Velvet Underground to promote the album. Yule took over lead vocals and switched his main instrument from bass to guitar, and Walter Powers was recruited as the Velvets' new bass guitarist. Following the release of Loaded in Europe in the spring of 1971, Morrison left the group in August to resume his academic studies in Texas, and was replaced by Willie Alexander on keyboards. Alexander, Powers and Tucker left the Velvets in late 1972 after being forced out by manager Steve Sesnick prior to a handful of European shows to promote Loaded in Europe. With no original band members left, and with a group of quickly assembled musicians, Yule played the final shows as the Velvet Underground in 1972. With Ian Paice of Deep Purple and some session musicians, Yule recorded the album Squeeze in late 1972. It was released in February 1973, and is in essence a Doug Yule solo album, though presented as a Velvet Underground album due to band manager Steve Sesnick's contractual agreement with Polydor, and due to the success of Live at Max's Kansas City, which had received positive reviews the previous year. After two final shows in early 1973 (billed by the promoter as \\"The Velvet Underground\\", against Yule's wishes), the band was officially retired. ====Lou Reed session work (1974‚Äì1976)==== In 1974 Reed contacted Yule to contribute a melodic bass track on his solo album Sally Can't Dance (1974), on the song \\"Billy\\", which closes the album, and Yule joined Reed's band for the subsequent US and European tour as his guitar player. Following the tour the band dissolved, but Yule was called back by Reed in 1975 to record several guitar and bass tracks for his upcoming album Coney Island Baby, the 30th anniversary re-issue of which includes the bonus tracks that feature Yule on bass and guitar. ====1976‚Äì1978 (Elliot Murphy, American Flyer and hiatus from music)==== In early 1976 Yule played guitar on Night Lights (1976) by Elliott Murphy, and joined the band American Flyer later that year as their drummer and background singer. American Flyer was an active country rock band from 1976 to 1978, and the band also featured the guitarist Steve Katz of Blood, Sweat & Tears. After securing a major-label contract with United Artists, and managing to interest George Martin enough to bring him on board as their producer, American Flyer's debut album American Flyer debuted at #87 on the Billboard Top 200, and they even scored a minor hit with their single \\"Let Me Down Easy\\" which debuted at #80 in 1976. Despite the promise showed on their first album, their follow-up album Spirit of a Woman failed to chart as high, and did not carry the momentum the label expected, and the band decided to fold. After American Flyer disbanded, Yule retired from doing music full-time, and became a cabinetmaker and a luthier of violins. ===1990‚Äìpresent=== When the Velvet Underground reformed in the early 1993, Sterling Morrison had campaigned for Yule's involvement, but Lou Reed and John Cale ultimately overruled him, thus leaving Yule off the band's six-week reunion tour of Europe, and the subsequent live album Live MCMXCIII. Following the continual interest in the Velvet Underground, and partly due to the publicity of the band's released box set Peel Slowly and See in 1995, Yule, who had by then moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, returned to public life, again giving interviews to journalists and various fanzines about his time in the Velvet Underground. He also wrote an obituary for Sterling Morrison, who had died in 1995. Yule was not included along with the original line-up for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when the Velvet Underground were inducted in 1996. However, Yule remains a member of the Velvet business partnership, and continued to give the occasional interview about his time in the group. After having taken up the violin, Yule began to record music again in 1997. A song called \\"Beginning To Get It\\" appeared on the benefit compilation A Place to Call Home in 1998. He played some concerts in 2000, while the live album Live in Seattle was released in Japan in 2002. He featured on Tucker's live album Moe Rocks Terrastock. On August 31, 2006, Yule performed for the first time in public in New York City in over 30 years with Mark Gardener of Ride at Pianos. On December 8, 2009, he appeared with Reed and Tucker at the New York Public Library, to commemorate the publishing of The Velvet Underground ‚Äì New York Art, a collection of rare photographs of the band's first performance in New York City to Andy Warhol's cover designs. They conducted a Q&A; with a sold- out live audience, and David Fricke acted as moderator to the event. ==Personal life== Yule currently lives in Wallingford, Seattle with his partner Beth, his son Dan, and two dogs. ==Discography== ===With the Velvet Underground=== * The Velvet Underground (1969) * Loaded (1970) * Live at Max's Kansas City (1972) * Squeeze (1973) * 1969: The Velvet Underground Live (1974) * VU (outtakes compilation, 1985 [1968‚Äì1969]) * Another View (outtakes compilation, 1986 [1967‚Äì1969]) * Chronicles (compilation, 1991) * Peel Slowly and See (box set, 1995 [1965‚Äì1970]) * Final V.U. 1971-1973 (live box set, 2001 [1971‚Äì1973]) * Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes (live, 2001 [1969]) * The Very Best of the Velvet Underground (best of, 2003 [1966‚Äì1970]) * The Complete Matrix Tapes (live, 2015 [1969]) ===With Lou Reed=== * Sally Can't Dance (1974) * Coney Island Baby: 30th Anniversary Edition (1975, 2005) * Between Thought and Expression: The Lou Reed Anthology (1992) ===With American Flyer=== * American Flyer (1976) * Spirit of a Woman (1977) ===Solo=== * Live in Seattle (2002) ===With RedDog=== * Hard Times (2009) * Nine-Tail Cat (2011) ===Other=== * Elliott Murphy: Night Lights (1976) * Maureen Tucker: Moe Rocks Terrastock (2002) * The Loves: ...Love You (2010) ==References== ==External links== *Doug Yule ‚Äì Violin page *RedDog ‚Äì RedDog home page *Doug Yule ‚Äì fansite *Velvet Underground Squeeze ‚Äì essay about the later, Yule-led days of the Velvet Underground and their final album *Doug Yule Interview ‚Äì from 1994 *Interview from 2008 about the Velvet Underground and folk music *Doug Yule Interview from Perfect Sound Forever Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:People from Great Neck, New York Category:American rock bass guitarists Category:American male bass guitarists Category:American rock keyboardists Category:American rock songwriters Category:American organists Category:American male organists Category:American rock singers Category:American multi-instrumentalists Category:American rock guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American male singer-songwriters Category:The Velvet Underground members Category:Musicians from New York (state) Category:Bowed string instrument makers Category:Guitarists from New York (state) Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:20th-century American pianists Category:American Flyer (band) members Category:American male pianists Category:21st-century American keyboardists Category:21st- century organists Category:20th-century American keyboardists Category:20th- century American male musicians Category:20th-century male singers Category:21st-century American male musicians Category:21st-century male singers ","title":"Doug Yule"},{"id":"1269328","text":"Pivka (, , ) is a small town in Slovenia in the Pivka Basin in the Karst region.

The name of the settlement was changed from ≈†ent Peter na Krasu (literally, 'Saint Peter in the Karst') to Pivka in 1952. The name was changed on the basis of the 1948 Law on Names of Settlements and Designations of Squares, Streets, and Buildings as part of efforts by Slovenia's postwar communist government to remove religious elements from toponyms.Spremembe naselij 1948‚Äì95. 1996.

It was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in 1988. ==Medical uses== Felodipine is used to treat high blood pressure and stable angina. It should not be used for people who are pregnant, have acute heart failure, are having a heart attack, have an obstructed heart valve, or have obstructions that block bloodflow out of the heart. For people with liver failure the dose needs to be lowered, because felodipine is cleared by the liver. ==Adverse effects== The only very common side effect, occurring in more than 1/10 people, is pain and swelling in the arms and legs. Common side effects, occurring in between 1% and 10% of people, include flushing, headache, heart palpitations, dizziness and fatigue. Felodipine can exacerbate gingivitis. == Interactions == Felodipine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4, so substances that inhibit or activate CYP3A4 can strongly effect how much felodipine is present. CYP3A4 inhibitors, which increase the amount of felodipine available per dose, include cimetidine, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, HIV protease inhibitors, and grapefruit juice.. CYP3A4 activators, which decrease the amount of felodipine available per dose, include phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, barbiturates, efavirenz, nevirapine, and Saint John's wort. ==Mechanism of action== Felodipine is a calcium channel blocker. Felodipine has additionally been found to act as an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, or as an antimineralocorticoid. Different calcium channels are present in vascular tissue and cardiac tissue; an in vitro study on human vascular and cardiac tissues comparing how selective various calcium channel blockers are for vascular compared to cardiac tissue found the following vascular/cardiac tissue ratios: mibefradil 41, felodipine 12; nifedipine 7, amlodipine 5, and verapamil 0.2. ==Chemistry== Felodipine is a member of the 1,4-dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers. It is a racemic mixture, and is insoluble in water but is soluble in dichloromethane and ethanol. ==History== The Swedish company H√§ssle, a division of Astra AB, discovered felodipine; it filed a patent application in 1979 claiming felodipine as an antihypertensive drug. Astra partnered this drug and others with Merck & Co. in the US under a 1982 agreement between the companies. The drug was approved by the FDA in 1991 after a three and a half year review; the drug entered a very crowded market the included the other calcium channel blockers nifedipine, verapamil, nicardipine, and isradipine. The FDA gave the drug a 1C rating, meaning that it found little difference between felodipine and the drugs already approved for the same use. In 1994 Astra AB and Merck changed their partnership to a joint venture called Astra Merck, and in 1998 Astra (by that time, AstraZeneca) bought out Merck's rights in the joint venture. The first generics became available in Sweden in 2003 and in the US in 2004. In April 2016, AstraZeneca announced that they were selling the right to market felodipine in China to China Medical System Holdings for $310 million; AZ would continue to manufacture the drug. ==Society and culture== As of 2016, felodipine was marketed under many brand names worldwide: Auronal, Cardioplen, Catrazil, Dewei, Dilahex, Enfelo, Erding, Fedil, Fedisyn, Feldil, Felicipin, Felo, Felocard, Felocor, Feloday, Felodil, Felodin, Felodip, Felodipin, Felodipina, Felodipine, Felodipino, Felodistad, Felogard, Felohexal, Felop, Felopine, Felostad, Feloten, Felotens, Felpin, Flodicar, Flodil, Keliping, Keydipin, Lodistad, Modip, Munobal, Nirmadil, Parmid, Penedil, Perfudal, Phelop, Phenodical, Plendil, Plentopine, Polo, Presid, Preslow, Prevex, Renedil, Sistar, Splendil, Stapin, Topidil, Vascalpha, Versant, and XiaoDing. The combination of felodipine and candesartan was marketed as Atacand. The combination of felodipine and ramipril was marketed as Delmuno, Tazko, Triacor, Triapin, Triasyn, Tri-Plen, Unimax, and Unitens. The combination of felodipine and enalapril was marketed as Lexxel. The combination of felodipine and metoprolol was marketed as Logimat, Logimax, and Mobloc. == References == Category:Antimineralocorticoids Category:Calcium channel blockers Category:Dihydropyridines Category:AstraZeneca brands Category:Carboxylate esters Category:Chloroarenes ","title":"Felodipine"},{"id":"1269334","text":"Nayantara Sahgal (born 10 May 1927) is an Indian writer who writes in English.

Pandit was also a classical scholar who had translated Kalhana's epic history Rajatarangini into English from Sanskrit. He was arrested for his support of Indian independence and died in Lucknow prison jail in 1944, leaving behind his wife (Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit) and their three daughters Chandralekha Mehta, Nayantara Sehgal and Rita Dar. Sahgal's mother, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, was the daughter of Motilal Nehru and sister of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Vijayalakshmi had been active in the Indian freedom struggle, had been to jail for this cause and in 1946, was part of the first team representing newly formed India that went to the then newly formed United Nations, along with M.C.Chagla., Tenth Edition, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, 2000, After India achieved independence, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit served as a member of India's Constituent Assembly, the governor of several Indian states, and as India's ambassador to the Soviet Union, the United States, Mexico, the Court of St. James, Ireland, and the United nations. Sahgal (right) with Frida Kahlo (centre) in Mexico City (1947) Sahgal attended a number of schools as a girl, given the turmoil in the Nehru family during the last years (1935‚Äì47) of the Indian freedom struggle. Ultimately, she graduated from Woodstock School in the Himalayan hill station of Landour in 1943 and later in the United States from Wellesley College (BA, 1947), which she attended along with her sister Chandralekha, who graduated 2 years earlier in 1945. She has made her home for decades in Dehradun, a town close to Landour where she had attended boarding school (at Woodstock). ==Marriage and career== Nayantara Sahgal speaking at the launch of Mistaken Identity by HarperPerennial in Delhi, November 2007 Sahgal has been married twice, first to Gautam Sehgal and later to E.N. Mangat Rai, a Punjabi Christian who was an Indian Civil Service officer. Though part of the Nehru family, Sahgal developed a reputation for maintaining her independent critical sense. Her independent tone, and her mother's, led to both falling out with her cousin Indira Gandhi during the most autocratic phases of the latter's time in office in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s. Gandhi cancelled Sahgal's scheduled appointment as India's Ambassador to Italy within days of her return to power. Not one to be intimidated, Sahgal in 1982 wrote a scathing, insightful account of Gandhi's rise to power. Gita Sahgal, the writer and journalist on issues of feminism, fundamentalism, and racism, director of prize-winning documentary films, and human rights activist, is her daughter. On 6 October 2015, Sahgal returned her Sahitya Akademi Award to protest what she called \\"increasing intolerance and supporting right to dissent in the country\\", following the murders of rationalists Govind Pansare, Narendra Dabholkar and M. M. Kalburgi, and the Dadri mob lynching incident; for this she was praised in 2017 by Karima Bennoune, United Nations monitor for cultural rights. In September 2018 she was elected as a Vice President of PEN International ==Bibliography== *Prison and Chocolate Cake (memoir; 1954) *From Fear Set Free (memoir; 1963) *A Time to Be Happy (novel; 1963) *This Time of Morning (novel; 1965) *Storm in Chandigarh (novel; 1969) *The Freedom Movement in India (1970) *Sunlight Surrounds You (novel; 1970) (with Chandralekha Mehta and Rita Dar i.e. her two sisters; this was the daughters' tribute to their mother) *The Day in Shadow (novel; 1971) *A Voice for Freedom (1977) *Indira Gandhi's Emergence and Style (1978) *Indira Gandhi: Her Road to Power (novel; 1982) *Plans for Departure (novel; 1985) *Rich Like Us (novel; 1985) *Mistaken Identity (novel; 1988) *A Situation in New Delhi (novel; 1989) *Lesser Breeds (novel; 2003) * Relationship (collection of letters exchanged between Nayantara Sahgal and E.N.Mangat Rai;1994) * Before freedom: Nehru's letters to his sister 1909-1947 (edited by Nayantara Sahgal) *The Fate of Butterflies (novella; 2019) ==See also== *Nehru-Gandhi family *Political Families of The World ==References== ==Further reading== *Ritu Menon, \\"Out of line: A literary and political biography of Nayantara Sahgal. 2014\\". *Asha Choubey, \\"The Fictional Milieu of Nayantara Sahgal: A Feminist Perspective.

It contains budesonide, a steroid and formoterol, a long-acting Œ≤2-agonist (LABA). The product monograph does not support its use for sudden worsening or treatment of active bronchospasm. However, a 2020 review of the literature does support such use. It is used by breathing in the medication. Common side effects include throat pain, influenza, runny nose, and a yeast infection of the mouth. There were concerns that the LABA component increases the risk of death in children with asthma, however these concerns were removed in 2017. Therefore, this combination is only recommended in those who are not controlled on an inhaled steroid alone. There is tentative evidence that typical doses of inhaled steroids and LABAs are safe in pregnancy. Both formoterol and budesonide are excreted in breast-milk. Budesonide/formoterol was approved for medical use in the United States in 2006. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In the United States, as of 2017, the wholesale cost of an inhaler is about US$30. In the United Kingdom, the cost as of 2015, was about for a unit with 120 doses. In 2017, it was the 74th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than ten million prescriptions. ==Medical uses== ===Maintenance=== Budesonide/formoterol has shown efficacy to prevent asthma attacks. It is unclear if budesonide/formoterol differs from fluticasone and salmeterol in chronic asthma. ===Exacerbation=== The combination is approved in the United States only as a maintenance medication in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, a 2020 review of the literature does support use as needed during acute worsening in those with mild disease, and as maintenance followed by extra doses during worsening. Use for both maintenance and as needed treatment is also known as single maintenance and reliever therapy ( SMART) and is a well-established treatment. It has been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations that require oral corticosteroids, hospital visits better than maintenance inhaled corticosteroids alone at a higher dose, or inhaled corticosteroid at the same or higher dose with a long acting bronchodilator (LABA)), with a short-acting bronchodilator (SABA) as a reliever. More studies using budesonide/formoterol SMART in children are needed. ==Side effects== ===Common (up to 1 in 10 people)=== *Mild throat irritation *Coughing *Hoarseness *Oral candidiasis (thrush. significantly less likely if the patient rinses their mouth out with water after inhalations) *Headache Often mild, and usually disappear as the medication continues to be used: * Heart palpitations * Trembling ===Uncommon (up to 1 in 100 people)=== *Feeling restlessness, nervous, or agitated *Disturbed sleep *Feeling dizzy *Nausea *Tachycardia (fast heart rate) *Bruising of the skin *Muscle cramps ===Rare (up to 1 in 1,000 people)=== *Rash *Itchiness *Bronchospasm (tightening of the muscles in the airways causing wheezing immediately after use of the medication, which is possibly sign of an allergic reaction and should be met with immediate medical attention) *Hypokalemia (low levels of potassium in the blood) *Heart arrhythmia ===Very rare (up to 1 in 10,000 people)=== *Depression *Changes in behaviour, especially in children *Chest pain or tightness in chest *Increase in blood glucose levels *Taste changes, such as an unpleasant taste in the mouth *Changes in blood pressure ===Other=== With high doses for a long period of time. * Reduced bone mineral density, causing osteoporosis * Cataracts * Glaucoma * Slowed rate of growth in children and adolescents * Dysfunction of the adrenal gland, which affects the production of various hormones === Allergic reaction === * Angioedema (swelling of the face, mouth, tongue, and/or throat. Difficulty swallowing. Hives. Difficulty breathing. Feeling of faintness) * Bronchospasm (sudden acute wheezing or shortness of breath immediately after use of medication. The patient should use their reliever medication immediately.) ==Society and culture== ===Doses=== Unopened Symbicort Turbuhaler (left) and opened (middle and right) Symbicort in the United States is a metered-dose inhaler and is available in 160/4.5mcg and 80/4.5mcg per actuation. In the European Union, Australia, Canada, Israel, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere the combination is available as a dry powder inhaler in the following doses: 50/3 (40/2.25), 100/3 (80/2.25), 100/6 (80/4.5), 200/6 (160/4.5) and 400/12 (320/9), where the larger number is the dose per actuation of budesonide (in micrograms) and the lower number the dose of formoterol (also in micrograms). ===Market=== Budesonide/formoterol formulation was introduced in Sweden in 2000. It was approved for use in the United States in July 2006. It is now approved for use in at least 70 countries, yielding global sales in excess of $1 billion in 2005, and now approximately $3.7 billion per annum. Budesonide/formoterol was approved for use in the European Union in April 2014. There are several patents related to the drug; some of them are already expired. It was initially marketed by AstraZeneca. == References == == External links == * * * Category:Combination drugs Category:Respiratory agents Category:AstraZeneca brands Category:World Health Organization essential medicines Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Budesonide/formoterol"},{"id":"1269353","text":"Philosophy in the Bedroom (La philosophie dans le boudoir) is a 1795 book by the Marquis de Sade written in the form of a dramatic dialogue. Though initially considered a work of pornography, the book has come to be considered a socio-political drama. Set in a bedroom, the two lead characters make the argument that the only moral system that reinforces the recent political revolution is libertinism, and that if the people of France fail to adopt the libertine philosophy, France will be destined to return to a monarchic state.\\"The Marquis de Sade: A Very Short Introduction\\" by John Phillips, 2005. In the chapter titled \\"Fifth Dialogue\\", there is a lengthy section where the character Chevalier reads a philosophical pamphlet titled \\"Frenchmen, Some More Effort If You Wish To Become Republicans\\". The pamphlet clearly represents Sade's philosophy on religion and morality, a philosophy he passionately hopes the citizens of France will embrace and codify into the laws of their new republican government.\\"Philosophy in the Bedroom\\" by Marquis de Sade, translated by Joachim Neugroschel, 2006. Continually throughout the work, Sade makes the argument that one must embrace atheism, reject society's beliefs about pleasure and pain, and further makes his argument that if any crime is committed while seeking pleasure, it cannot be condemned.\\"Philosophy in the Bedroom\\" by Marquis de Sade, translated by Richard Seaver and Austryn Wainhouse, 2002. ==Characters== *Eug√©nie, a 15-year-old girl who at the beginning of the dialogue is a virgin, na√Øve of all things sexual, who has been brought up by her mother to be well-mannered, modest, decent and obedient. *Madame de Saint-Ange, a 26-year-old libertine woman who is the owner of the house and bedroom in which the dialogue is set. She invites Eug√©nie for a two-day course on being libertine. *Le Chevalier de Mirval, Madame de Saint-Ange's 20-year-old brother. He aids his sister and Dolmanc√© on the ordeal of \\"educating\\" Eug√©nie. *Dolmanc√©, a 36-year-old atheist and bisexual (though with a strong preference for men), and friend of Le Chevalier's. He is Eug√©nie's foremost teacher and \\"educator\\". *Madame de Mistival, Eug√©nie's provincial, self-righteous mother. *Augustin, Madame de Saint-Ange's eighteen or twenty year-old gardener. Summoned to assist in the sexual activities in the fifth dialogue. ==Plot== In the introduction, the Marquis de Sade exhorts his readers to indulge in the various activities in the play. He says that the work is dedicated to \\"voluptuaries of all ages, of every sex\\" and urges readers to emulate the characters. \\"Lewd women\\", he writes, \\"let the voluptuous Saint-Ange be your model; after her example, be heedless of all that contradicts pleasure's divine laws, by which all her life she was enchained.\\" He then urges \\"young maidens\\" to copy Eug√©nie; \\"be as quick as she to destroy, to spurn all those ridiculous precepts inculcated in you by imbecile parents\\". Finally, he urges male readers to \\"study the cynical Dolmanc√©\\" and follow his example of selfishness and consideration for nothing but his own enjoyment. Dolmanc√© is the most dominant of the characters in the dialogue. He explains to Eug√©nie that morality, compassion, religion, and modesty are all absurd notions that stand in the way of the sole aim of human existence: pleasure. Like most of Sade's work, Philosophy in the Bedroom features a great deal of sex as well as libertine philosophies. Although there is some torture, the dialogue contains no actual murder, unlike many of Sade's works. Dolmanc√© and Madame de Saint-Ange start off by giving Eug√©nie their own brand of sex education, explaining the biological facts and declaring that physical pleasure is a far more important motive for sex than that of reproduction. Both characters explain that she will not be able to feel \\"true pleasure\\" without pain. Then they eagerly get down to the practical lessons, with Le Chevalier joining them in the fourth act and swiftly helping to take away Eug√©nie's virginity. Eug√©nie is instructed on the pleasures of various sexual practices and she proves to be a fast learner. As is usually the case in Sade's work, the characters are all bisexual, and sodomy is the preferred activity of all concerned, especially Dolmanc√©, who prefers male sexual partners and will not have anything other than anal intercourse with females. Madame de Saint-Ange and her younger brother, the Chevalier, also have sex with one another, and boast of doing so on a regular basis. Their incest ‚Äî and all manner of other sexual activity and taboos, such as sodomy, adultery and homosexuality ‚Äî is justified by Dolmanc√© in a series of energetic arguments that ultimately boil down to \\"if it feels good, do it\\". The Marquis de Sade believed this was his ultimate argument: if a crime (even murder) took place during one's desire for pleasure, then it could not be punished by law. He was backed in this thought through his belief that Hobbes was wrong about mankind, that mankind is neither good or evil, it is his will that is ultimately evil. (Sodomy was illegal and punishable by death in France at the time the dialogue was written, and Sade himself was convicted of sodomy in 1772.) The corruption of Eug√©nie is actually at the request of her father, who has sent her to Madame de Saint-Ange for the very purpose of having his daughter stripped of the morality her virtuous mother taught her. The dialogue is split into seven parts, or \\"dialogues\\", and was originally illustrated by Sade himself. There is a lengthy section within the fifth dialogue titled \\"Yet Another Effort, Frenchmen, If You Would Become Republicans\\", in which the Marquis de Sade argued that, having done away with the monarchy in the French Revolution, the people of France should take the final step towards liberty by abolishing religion too. \\"Frenchmen, I repeat it to you: Europe awaits her deliverance from specter and censer alike. Know well that you cannot possibly liberate her from royal tyranny without at the same time breaking for her the fetters of religious superstition; the shackles of the one are too intimately linked to those of the other; let one of the two survive, and you cannot avoid falling subject to the other you have left intact. It is no longer before the knees of either an imaginary being or a vile impostor a republican must prostrate himself; his only gods must now be courage and liberty. Rome disappeared immediately Christianity was preached there, and France is doomed if she continues to revere it\\". In the final act, Eug√©nie's mother, Madame de Mistival, arrives to rescue her daughter from the \\"monsters\\" who have corrupted her. Eug√©nie's father, however, warns his daughter and friends in advance and urges them to punish his wife, whose person and virtue he clearly loathes. Madame de Mistival is horrified to find that not only did her husband arrange for their daughter's corruption, but Eug√©nie has already lost any moral standards she previously possessed, along with any respect or obedience towards her mother. Eug√©nie refuses to leave and Madame de Mistival is soon stripped, beaten, whipped and raped, her daughter taking an active part in this brutality and even declaring her wish to kill her mother. Dolmanc√© eventually calls in for a servant who has syphilis to rape Eug√©nie's mother. Eug√©nie sews up her vagina and Dolmanc√© her anus to keep the polluted seed inside and she is then sent home in tears, knowing her daughter has been lost to the corrupt, libertine mentality of Dolmanc√© and his accomplices. ==Legacy== Spanish director Jes√∫s Franco has made two films based on Philosophy in the Bedroom: Eugenie‚Ä¶ The Story of Her Journey into Perversion (1970) and Eugenie (Historia de una perversi√≥n) (1980). Italian director Aurelio Grimaldi also filmed it, as L'educazione sentimentale di Eugenie (2005). In 2003, a play based on Philosophy in the Bedroom titled \\"XXX\\" was staged in a number of European cities. It featured live simulated sex and audience interaction that caused some controversy. ==Footnotes== ==References== *Justine, Philosophy in the Bedroom and Other Writings (1965) Arrow Books () *Marquis de Sade for Beginners (1995) Stuart Hood and Graham Crowley, Icon Books, () * The Sadeian woman: and the ideology of pornography (1978) Angela Carter, Pantheon Books () * Marquis de Sade: His Life and Works (2002) Iwan Bloch, The Minerva Group, Inc., () pp. 206‚Äì209 ==External links== *Original French text at Wikisource *Full-text (PDF) at sin.org * La philosophie dans le boudoir, ouvrage posthume de l'Auteur de Justine, vol. 1, vol. 2, a Londres, Aux d√©pens de la Compagnie, 1795.

Formoterol has an extended duration of action (up to 12 h) compared to short-acting Œ≤2 agonists such as salbutamol (albuterol), which are effective for 4 h to 6 h. LABAs such as formoterol are used as \\"symptom controllers\\" to supplement prophylactic corticosteroid therapy. A \\"reliever\\" short-acting Œ≤2 agonist (e.g., salbutamol) is still required, since LABAs are not recommended for the treatment of acute asthma. It was patented in 1972 and came into medical use in 1998. It is also marketed in the combination formulations budesonide/formoterol and mometasone/formoterol. ==Side effects== In November 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a health advisory alerting the public to findings that show the use of long-acting Œ≤2 agonists could lead to a worsening of wheezing symptoms in some patients. At the current time, available long-acting Œ≤2 agonists include salmeterol, formoterol, bambuterol, and sustained-release oral salbutamol. Combinations of inhaled steroids and long-acting bronchodilators are becoming more widespread ‚Äì combination preparations include fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol. ==Mechanism of action== Inhaled formoterol works like other Œ≤2 agonists, causing bronchodilation by relaxing the smooth muscle in the airway so as to treat the exacerbation of asthma. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Inhaler for a powder based in budesonide and formoterol It is marketed in three forms: a dry-powder inhaler (DPI), a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) and an inhalation solution, under various brand names including Atock, Atimos/Atimos Modulite, Foradil/Foradile, Oxeze/Oxis, and Perforomist. * Foradil/Foradile capsules for oral inhalation (Schering-Plough in the U.S., Novartis rest of world) * Oxeze/Oxis Turbuhaler Dry powder inhaler (DPI) (AstraZeneca) * Atock (Astellas) * Atimos/Atimos Modulite Metered-dose inhaler (MDI) (Chiesi) * Perforomist inhalation solution (Mylan N.V.) ==Uses and combinations== * Arformoterol ((R,R)-(‚àí)-formoterol) ‚Äî an enantiopure compound used in the management of COPD * Combination drugs: ** Aclidinium bromide/formoterol ** Budesonide/formoterol ** Mometasone furoate/formoterol ==ReferencesCategory:Beta2-adrenergic agonists Category:Phenol ethers Category:Phenols Category:Schering-Plough brands Category:Merck & Co. brands Category:AstraZeneca brands Category:Novartis brands Category:Formamides Category:Substituted amphetamines Category:Phenylethanolamines pnb:ÿ¢ŸÖŸà ÿØÿ±€åÿß ","title":"Formoterol"},{"id":"1269376","text":"This is a list of ski areas and resorts in Iran.

In June 1942, Blobel was put in charge of Sonderaktion 1005, with the task of destroying the evidence of Nazi atrocities in Eastern Europe. After the war, he was convicted at the Einsatzgruppen Trial and executed. ==Early life== Born in the city of Potsdam, Blobel fought in the First World War, in which by all accounts he served well, being decorated with the Iron Cross first class. After the war, Blobel studied architecture and practiced this profession from 1924 until 1931, when upon losing his job he joined the Nazi Party, the SA, and the SS (he had joined all of these by 1 December 1931). Early war-time ID issued to Paul Blobel by the \\"Volkswohlfahrt\\", Nazi Germany's welfare organization. ==SS career== Blobel in SS uniform In 1933 Blobel joined the police force in D√ºsseldorf. In June 1934 he was recruited into the SD Security Service. During World War II, following Operation Barbarossa, in June 1941 Blobel became the commanding officer of Sonderkommando 4a of Einsatzgruppe C, active in Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Both, Einsatzgruppen and the Order Police battalions were responsible for massacres of Jews behind the Wehrmacht lines in the Soviet Union. The murder campaign included all political and racial undesirables. In August 1941 Blobel was put in charge of creating a Nazi ghetto in Zhytomyr to enclose around 3,000 Jews who were murdered a month later.Ogorreck, Ralf (2010). Les Einsatzgruppen, Tallandier, p. 150, On 10 or 11 August 1941, Friedrich Jeckeln ordered him, on behalf of Adolf Hitler, to exterminate the entire Jewish population.Ogorreck, Ralf, op. cit. p. 203. On 22 August 1941, the Sonderkommando murdered Jewish women and children at Bila Tserkva with the consent of Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau, commander of the 6th Army. SS- Obersturmf√ºhrer August H√§fner testified at his own 1942 trial: Blobel, in conjunction with Reichenau's and Friedrich Jeckeln's units, organised the Babi Yar massacre in late September 1941 in Kiev,Christopher Browning: The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy, September 1939 - March 1942 (With contributions by J√ºrgen Matth√§us), Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2004. pp. 291‚Äì292 where 33,771 Jews were murdered. In November 1941, Blobel received and activated the first gas vans at Poltava. Blobel was relieved of his command on 13 January 1942, officially for health reasons, but mostly due to his alcoholism. In June 1942 he was put in charge of Aktion 1005, with the task of destroying the evidence of all Nazi atrocities in Eastern Europe. This entailed exhumation of mass graves, then incinerating the bodies. Blobel developed efficient disposal techniques such as alternating layers of bodies with firewood on a frame of iron rails. In October 1944 he headed an anti-partisan group in Yugoslavia. Gitta Sereny related the conversation about Blobel she once had with one-time Chief of the Church Information Branch at the Reich Security Head Office, Albert Hartl. ==Trial and conviction== Blobel is sentenced to death at the Einsatzgruppen trial, 10 April, 1948. Up to 59,018 killings are attributable to Blobel, though during testimony he was alleged to have killed 10,000‚Äì15,000 people. He was later sentenced to death by the U.S. Nuremberg Military Tribunal in the Einsatzgruppen trial. He was hanged at Landsberg Prison shortly after midnight on June 7, 1951.\\"Five death sentences were confirmed: the sentence against Oswald Pohl, as well as those passed against the leaders of the Mobile Killing Units, Paul Blobel, Werner Braune, Erich Neumann and Otto Ohrlendorf. ...

His career in motoring started with the Ford Motor Company in 1977, as a graduate trainee from the University of Wales with a degree in Economics. Working first in Sales and then Market Research, in 1978, he was moved to Product Development as Product Planner. He helped develop a variety of models over the next 12 years, including several performance models like the Ford Escort Cosworth, the RS200 and others. He also spent a spell at Aston Martin in the early 1990s whilst the company was under Ford ownership, overseeing the development and launch of the critically acclaimed DB7 model and switch from manufacturer of handbuilt-only vehicles at the traditional Newport Pagnell site to a higher-volume producer at a new factory operation at Bloxham. Following this spell at Aston Martin, he returned to Ford in 1995, taking over as director of Service Engineering within the Customer Service Division, his time there being most noticeable for an early television appearance in a combative appearance opposite Anne Robinson on the BBC's Watchdog programme, robustly defending Ford's handling of a safety recall campaign for brake servo assist pumps in its diesel car range. Fry joined Prodrive as Managing Director in January 2001, upon the persuasion of David Richards, where he has been responsible for leading Prodrive's expansion into outsourced engineering services. Within four months of his appointment, Prodrive Automotive Technology had a full order book for 2001 and major steps had been taken to grow the company in the UK and beyond with the acquisition of the Tickford Group. This expansion saw Fry become Group Managing Director overseeing both the company's engineering and racing operations. In January 2002, he was appointed Managing Director of BAR F1 in addition to his Prodrive responsibilities. Fry achieved his first victory as a manager/chief executive of a Formula 1 team when Jenson Button took the chequered flag at the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix. On the 15 June 2012 Nick Fry received an Honorary Doctorate from Cranfield University in recognition of his services to motorsport.

It is the main business and financial centre of Lagos in Lagos State, Nigeria. Victoria Island is one of the most exclusive and expensive areas to reside in Lagos. The town and island lie within the boundaries of the Eti-Osa Local Government Area (LGA). Victoria Island ==History== A large part of the Island was originally part of jurisdiction of the Oniru chieftaincy family of Lagos with tenants inhabiting the land. In 1948, the Lagos Executive Development Board paid 250,000 pounds as compensation for the land acquired from the Oniru family and an additional 150,000 pounds as compensation for the inhabitants and shrines destroyed. The inhabitants were later resettled at Maroko village. Victoria Island was originally surrounded entirely by water. It was bordered by the Atlantic Ocean on the south, the mouth of the Lagos Lagoon on the West, the Five Cowrie Creek to the north North, and swamps on the East. The colonial government began the process of filling in the eastern swamps to reduce mosquito breeding areas. This created a land bridge between Victoria Island and Lekki Peninsula ending its existence as a true island. After independence, successive state governments expanded this development, culminating in the construction of a highway connecting Victoria Island to Epe. This activity, along with the rapid commercialization of Victoria Island, served to stimulate residential development along the Lekki-Epe corridor, starting with Lekki Phase 1. The area of the land bridge, composed of the former swampland, became a large slum called Maroko Town which housed many of the new migrants to Lagos State. Residents of the Island complained about this problem, leading the military Governor of the State, Raji Rasaki, to forcibly remove the residents on 14 July 1990, resulting in numerous injuries. Governor Rasaki and his armed security forces caused the eviction of as many as 300,000 residents, some of whom had legal title to their property. This new area established after the evictions was called Victoria Island Annex. It was cleared and sold to residential buyers. Subsequent reclamation expanded the area to the extent that Victoria Island Annex is now connected to the Lekki Peninsula. This new, enlarged area is referred to as ‚ÄúOniru Estate‚Äù after the ruling family of the area. ==Modern history== Victoria Island Originally designated an upscale residential area, failing infrastructure and overcrowding in the old business district on Lagos Island and lax zoning enforcement in Victoria Island led to a mass migration of businesses over the last twenty-five years. Today, Victoria Island is one of Nigeria's busiest centres of banking and commerce, with most major Nigerian and international corporations headquartered on the Island. The Island has continued to rapidly develop and along with Ikoyi, is a favourite spot for Nigerians and foreigners to live and play. However the influx of banks and other commercial ventures has changed the formerly serene atmosphere of the Island. Longtime residents complain about the increase in traffic and influx of street traders who cater to local bank employees and businessmen. A new project being developed by the Chagoury Group includes the Eko Atlantic City, located next to Victoria Island. The project is being built on reclaimed land that has been lost to coastal erosion. ==Economy== Business District, Victoria Island Guaranty Trust Bank and Access Bank plc have their headquarters on the island, Halliburton and IBM operate offices on Victoria Island. A Hewlett Packard office for West Africa is also located in Victoria Island. ==Maroko Town demolition== The displaced former residents of Maroko Town have pursued redress within the Nigerian justice system, without success. In 2008, a human rights organization, Social and Economic Rights Action Centre (SERAC), filed a complaint with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights on behalf of the Moroko people. Activists and displaced Maroko residents continue to hold Maroko Remembrance Day each year on 14 July.http://www.serac.org/Publications/E-Newsletter%20Volume%201,%20issue%202.pdf ==Diplomatic missions== Victoria Island hosts most of the diplomatic presence in Lagos, many of which were previously the embassies to Nigeria prior to the move of the capitol to Abuja. The now consulates, embassy branch offices, or Deputy High Commissions on Victoria Island include Benin, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Lebanon, the Netherlands, Russia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. ==Education== The British International School Lagos,\\"Contact Us.\\" British International School Lagos.

It is provided in the form of a capsule or tablet taken by mouth for Parkinson's disease and as a patch applied to skin for depression. Selegiline acts as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and increases levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain. At typical clinical doses, selegiline is a selective and irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), increasing levels of dopamine in the brain. In larger doses, it loses its specificity and also inhibits MAO-A, increasing levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the brain. ==Medical uses== ===Parkinson's disease=== In its pill form, selegiline is used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.Selegiline oral label. Updated December 31, 2008 It is most often used as an adjunct to drugs such as levodopa (L-DOPA), although it has been used off-label as a monotherapy. The rationale for adding selegiline to levodopa is to decrease the required dose of levodopa and thus reduce the motor complications of levodopa therapy. Selegiline delays the point when levodopa treatment becomes necessary from about 11 months to about 18 months after diagnosis. There is some evidence that selegiline acts as a neuroprotectant and reduces the rate of disease progression, though this is disputed. Selegiline has also been used off-label as a palliative treatment for dementia in Alzheimer's disease. ===Depression=== Selegiline is also delivered via a transdermal patch used as a treatment for major depressive disorder.Emsam label Last revised Sept 2014. Index page at FDA A quantitative review published in 2015 found that for the pooled results of the pivotal trials, the number needed to treat (a sign of effect size, so a low number is better) for the patch for symptom reduction was 11, and for remission, was 9. The number needed to harm (inverse of the NNT, a high number here is better) ranged from 387 for sexual side effects to 7 for application site reaction. With regard to the likelihood to be helped or harmed (LHH), the analysis showed that the selegiline patch was 3.6 times as likely to lead to a remission vs. a discontinuation due to side effects; the LHH for remission vs. incidence of insomnia was 2.1; the LHH for remission vs. discontinuation due to insomnia was 32.7. The LHH for remission vs. insomnia and sexual dysfunction were both very low. ===Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder=== Selegiline has been used in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ===Special populations=== For all human uses and all forms, selegiline is pregnancy category C: studies in pregnant lab animals have shown adverse effects on the fetus but there are no adequate studies in humans. ==Side effects== Side effects of the tablet form in conjunction with levodopa include, in decreasing order of frequency, nausea, hallucinations, confusion, depression, loss of balance, insomnia, increased involuntary movements, agitation, slow or irregular heart rate, delusions, hypertension, new or increased angina pectoris, and syncope. Most of the side effects are due to a high dopamine signaling, and can be alleviated by reducing the dose of levodopa. The main side effects of the patch form for depression include application-site reactions, insomnia, diarrhea, and sore throat. The selegiline patch carries a black box warning about a possible increased risk of suicide, especially for young people, as do all antidepressants since 2007. ==Interactions== Both the oral and patch forms come with strong warnings against combining selegiline with drugs that could produce serotonin syndrome, such as SSRIs and the cough medicine dextromethorphan. Selegiline in combination with the opioid analgesic pethidine is not recommended, as it can lead to severe adverse effects. Several other synthetic opioids such as tramadol and methadone, as well as various triptans, are contraindicated due to potential for serotonin syndrome. Birth control pills containing ethinylestradiol and a progestin increase the bioavailability of selegiline by 10- to 20-fold. High levels can lead to loss of MAO-B selectivity, and selegiline may begin inhibition MAO-A as well. This increases susceptibility to side effects of non-selective MAOIs, such as tyramine-induced hypertensive crisis and serotonin toxicity when combined with serotonergic medications. Both forms of the drug carry warnings about food restrictions to avoid hypertensive crisis that are associated with MAO inhibitors. The patch form was created in part to overcome food restrictions; clinical trials showed that it was successful. Additionally, in post-marketing surveillance from April 2006 to October 2010, only 13 self-reports of possible hypertensive events or hypertension were made out of 29,141 exposures to the drug, and none were accompanied by objective clinical data. The lowest dose of the patch method of delivery, 6 mg/24 hours, does not require any dietary restrictions. Higher doses of the patch and oral formulations, whether in combination with the older non-selective MAOIs or in combination with the reversible MAO-A inhibitor moclobemide, require a low-tyramine diet. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Selegiline is a selective inhibitor of MAO-B, irreversibly inhibiting it by binding to it covalently. It exerts effects by blocking the breakdown of dopamine, thus increasing its activity. Its possible neuroprotective properties may be due to protecting nearby neurons from the free oxygen radicals that are released by MAO-B activity. At higher doses, selegiline loses its selectivity for MAO-B and inhibits MAO-A as well. Selegiline also inhibits CYP2A6 and can increase the effects of nicotine as a result. Selegiline also appears to activate œÉ1 receptors, having a relatively high affinity for these receptors of approximately 400 nM. ===Pharmacokinetics=== Selegiline has an oral bioavailability of about 10%, which increases when ingested together with a fatty meal, as the molecule is fat soluble. Selegiline and its metabolites bind extensively to plasma proteins (at a rate of 94%). They cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and enter the brain, where they most concentrated at the thalamus, basal ganglia, midbrain, and cingulate gyrus. Selegiline is mostly metabolized in the intestines and liver; it and its metabolites are excreted in the urine. Buccal administration of selegiline results in 5-fold higher bioavailability, more reproducible blood concentration, and produces less amphetamine metabolites than the oral tablet form. ====Metabolism==== Selegiline is metabolized by cytochrome P450 to L-desmethylselegiline and levomethamphetamine. Desmethylselegiline has some activity against MAO-B, but much less than that of selegiline. It is thought to be further metabolized by CYP2C19. Levomethamphetamine is converted to levoamphetamine. Due to the presence of these metabolites, people taking selegiline may test positive for \\"amphetamine\\" or \\"methamphetamine\\" on drug screening tests. While the amphetamine metabolites may contribute to selegiline's ability to inhibit reuptake of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, they have also been associated with orthostatic hypotension and hallucinations. The amphetamine metabolites are hydroxylated and, in phase II, conjugated by glucuronyltransferase. A newer anti-Parkinson MAO-B inhibitor, rasagiline, metabolizes into 1(R)-aminoindan, which has no amphetamine-like characteristics. ====Patch==== Following application of the patch to humans, an average of 25% to 30% of the selegiline content is delivered systemically over 24 hours. Transdermal dosing results in significantly higher exposure to selegiline and lower exposure to all metabolites when compared to oral dosing; this is due to the extensive first- pass metabolism of the pill form and low first-pass metabolism of the patch form. The site of application is not a significant factor in how the drug is distributed. In humans, selegiline does not accumulate in the skin, nor is it metabolized there. ==Chemistry== Selegiline belongs to the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical families. It is also known as L-deprenyl, as well as (R)-(‚Äì)-N,Œ±-dimethyl-N-(2-propynyl)phenethylamine or (R)-(‚Äì)-N-methyl-N-2-propynylamphetamine. The compound is a derivative of levomethamphetamine (L-methamphetamine) with a propargyl group attached to the nitrogen atom. This detail is borrowed from pargyline, an older MAO-B inhibitor of the phenethylamine group. Selegiline is the levorotatory enantiomer of the racemic mixture deprenyl. Selegiline is synthesized by the alkylation of (‚Äì)-methamphetamine using propargyl bromide.J. Knoll, E. Sanfai, (1966).J. Hermann Nee Voeroes, Z. Ecsery, G. Sabo, L. Arvai, L. Nagi, O. Orban, E. Sanfai, (1986)B. Brunova, M. Ferenc, (1989) Another clinically used MAOI of the amphetamine class is tranylcypromine. center ==History== Following the discovery that the tuberculosis drug iproniazid elevated the mood of people taking it, and the subsequent discovery that the effect was likely due to inhibition of MAO, many people and companies started trying to discover MAO inhibitors to use as antidepressants. Selegiline was discovered by Zoltan Ecseri at the Hungarian drug company, Chinoin (part of Sanofi since 1993), which they called E-250. Chinoin received a patent on the drug in 1962 and the compound was first published in the scientific literature in English in 1965. Work on the biology and effects of E-250 in animals and humans was conducted by a group led by J√≥zsef Knoll at Semmelweis University which was also in Budapest. Emsam transdermal patch, 6mg/24hr dose Deprenyl is a racemic compound a mixture of two isomers called enantiomers. Further work determined that the levorotatory enantiomer was a more potent MAO-inhibitor, which was published in 1967, and subsequent work was done with the single enantiomer L-deprenyl. In 1971, Knoll showed that selegiline selectively inhibits the B-isoform of monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) and proposed that it is unlikely to cause the infamous \\"cheese effect\\" (hypertensive crisis resulting from consuming foods containing tyramine) that occurs with non-selective MAO inhibitors. A few years later, two Parkinson's disease researchers based in Vienna, Peter Riederer and Walther Birkmayer, realized that selegiline could be useful in Parkinson's disease. One of their colleagues, Prof. Moussa B.H. Youdim, visited Knoll in Budapest and took selegiline from him to Vienna. In 1975, Birkmayer's group published the first paper on the effect of selegiline in Parkinson's disease. In the 1970s there was speculation that it could be useful as an anti-aging drug or aphrodisiac. In 1987 Somerset Pharmaceuticals in New Jersey, which had acquired the US rights to develop selegiline, filed a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA to market the drug for Parkinson's disease in the US. While the NDA was under review, Somerset was acquired in a joint venture by two generic drug companies, Mylan and Bolan Pharmaceuticals. Selegiline was approved for Parkinson's disease by the FDA in 1989. In the 1990s, J. Alexander Bodkin at McLean Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, began a collaboration with Somerset to develop delivery of selegiline via a transdermal patch in order to avoid the well known dietary restrictions of MAO inhibitors. Somerset obtained FDA approval to market the patch in 2006. ==Society and culture== In E for Ecstasy (a book examining the uses of the street drug ecstasy in the UK) the writer, activist and ecstasy advocate Nicholas Saunders highlighted test results showing that certain consignments of the drug also contained selegiline. Consignments of ecstasy known as \\"Strawberry\\" contained what Saunders described as a \\"potentially dangerous combination of ketamine, ephedrine and selegiline,\\" as did a consignment of \\"Sitting Duck\\" Ecstasy tablets. David Pearce wrote The Hedonistic Imperative six weeks later after starting taking selegiline. In Gregg Hurwitz's novel Out of the Dark, selegiline (Emsam) and tyramine-containing food were used to assassinate the president of the United States. ==Veterinary use== In veterinary medicine, selegiline is sold under the brand name Anipryl (manufactured by Zoetis). It is used in dogs to treat canine cognitive dysfunction and, at higher doses, pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH). (PDF) Canine cognitive dysfunction is a form of dementia that mimics Alzheimer's disease in humans. Geriatric dogs treated with selegiline show improvements in sleeping pattern, reduced incontinence, and increased activity level; most show improvements by one month. Though it is labeled for dog use only, selegiline has been used off-label for geriatric cats with cognitive dysfunction. Selegiline's efficacy in treating pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism has been disputed. Theoretically, it works by increasing dopamine levels, which downregulates the release of ACTH, eventually leading to reduced levels of cortisol. Some claim that selegiline is only effective at treating PDH caused by lesions in the anterior pituitary (which comprise most canine cases). The greatest sign of improvement is lessening of abdominal distention. Side effects in dogs are uncommon, but they include vomiting, diarrhea, diminished hearing, salivation, decreased weight and behavioral changes such as hyperactivity, listlessness, disorientation, and repetitive motions. Selegiline does not appear to have a clinical effect on horses. ==References== Category:Alkyne derivatives Category:Antiparkinsonian agents Category:Dopamine reuptake inhibitors Category:Enantiopure drugs Category:Euphoriants Category:Monoamine oxidase inhibitors Category:Neuroprotective agents Category:Nootropics Category:Phenethylamines Category:Prodrugs Category:Sigma receptor ligands Category:Stimulants Category:Substituted amphetamines Category:Treatment and management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Category:World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited substances ","title":"Selegiline"},{"id":"1269442","text":"Petrila (; ) is a town in the Jiu Valley, Hunedoara County, Transylvania, Romania.

The name of the town was noted in 1733 as coming from the Latin word ‚Äúpetrinus‚Äù (\\"pietros\\" in Romanian), which can be translated into English to mean ‚Äúof stone‚Äù, a reference to the large coal deposits in the area that would become a profitable export in the Industrial Revolution. The exploitation of coal deposits in and around Petrila made the town grow as a single-industry town, revolving either around the mining of coal or the processing of the coal mined there, which is listed under the grade ‚ÄúPitcoal‚Äù. Mining operations began in 1840, but the town would remain sparsely populated until the arrival of Western Moldavian workers forced to relocate by the former president of Romania Nicolae Ceau»ôescu under Communist rule. The restructuring of the economy since 1989 has led to a decrease in production and supply for the region, including Petrila. It was the site in recent times of the Petrila Mine disaster, wherein two methane gas explosions in a coal mine on November 15, 2008 killed at least 12 miners and/or rescue workers. This is not the first time this millennium a coal mine in Petrila has suffered such an incident; another similar incident occurred in 2001. ==Economy== The mining in the town began in 1840 and the peak production of coal was in 1984 1,255,240 tonnes, since then it decreased to 504,000 tonnes. ==Population== As of 2011, it had a population of 21,373.

The family is cosmopolitan, and includes about 250 species in 14 genera, classified into two subfamilies: the Linoideae and Hugonioideae (often recognized as a distinct family, the Hugoniaceae). Leaves of the Linaceae are always simple; arrangement varies from alternate (most species) to opposite (in Sclerolinon and some Linum) or whorled (in some Hesperolinon and Linum species). The hermaphroditic, actinomorphic flowers are pentameric or, very rarely, tetrameric (e.g., Radiola linoides, Linum keniense). In the Linoideae, the largest genus is Linum, the flaxes, with 180‚Äì200 species including the cultivated flax, Linum usitatissimum. Members of the Linoideae include herbaceous annuals and perennials, as well as woody subshrubs, shrubs, and small trees (Tirpitzia) inhabiting temperate and tropical latitudes of Eurasia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. The largest genus of the Hugonioideae is Hugonia (about 40 species); the Hugonioideae are woody vines, shrubs, and trees, and are almost entirely tropical in distribution. In addition to their growth habits and geographic distributions, the Linoideae and Hugonioideae can be differentiated by the number of fertile stamens (five in the Linoideae, 10 in the Hugonioideae) and fruit type (capsules in the Linoideae, fleshy drupe-like fruits in the Hugonioideae).

The oldest source for T√∫athal's story, a 9th-century poem by Mael Mura of Othain, says that his father, F√≠acha Finnolach, was overthrown by the four provincial kings, Elim mac Conrach of Ulster, Sanb (son of Cet mac M√°gach) of Connacht, Foirbre of Munster and Eochaid Ainchenn of Leinster, and that it was Elim who took the High Kingship. During his rule Ireland suffered famine as God punished this rejection of legitimate kingship. T√∫athal, aided by the brothers Fiacha Cass√°n and Findmall and their 600 men, marched on Tara and defeated Elim in battle at the hill of Achall. He then won battles against the Ligmuini, the Gaili√≥in, the Fir Bolg, the Fir Domnann, the Ulaid, the Muma, the Fir √ìl n√âcmacht and the √ârainn, and assembled the Irish nobility at Tara to make them swear allegiance to him and his descendants.T.

Warner, \\"Tuathal Techtmar: A Myth or Ancient Literary Evidence for a Roman Invasion?\\", Emania 13, 1995, pp. 23‚Äì32 Later versions of the story suppress the involvement of the provincial nobility in the revolt, making the \\"subject peoples\\" the peasants of Ireland. The Lebor Gab√°la √ârennR. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, pp. 307‚Äì321 adds the detail of T√∫athal's exile. His mother, Eithne Imgel, daughter of the king of Alba (originally meaning Britain, later Scotland), was pregnant when F√≠achu was overthrown, and fled to her homeland where she gave birth to T√∫athal. Twenty years later T√∫athal and his mother returned to Ireland, joined up with Fiacha Cass√°n and Findmall, and marched on Tara to take the kingship. The Annals of the Four MastersAnnals of the Four Masters M9-106 features a similar revolt a few generations earlier, led by Cairbre Cinnchait, against the High King Crimthann Nia N√°ir. On this occasion Crimthann's son Feradach Finnfechtnach is the future king who escaped in his mother's womb, although the Annals claim he returned to reclaim his throne only five years later. The story repeats itself a few generations later with Elim's revolt against F√≠achu, and the exile and return of T√∫athal. Geoffrey KeatingGeoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar √âirinn 1.38, 39, 40 harmonises the two revolts into one. He has Crimthann hand the throne directly to his son, Feradach, and makes Cairbre Cinnchait, whose ancestry he traces to the Fir Bolg, the leader of the revolt that overthrew F√≠achu, killing him at a feast. The pregnant Eithne flees as in the other sources. Cairbre rules for five years, dies of plague and is succeeded by Elim. After Elim had ruled for twenty years, the 20- or 25-year-old T√∫athal was prevailed upon to return. He landed with his forces at Inber Domnainn (Malahide Bay). Joining up with Fiacha Cass√°n and Findmall and their marauders, he marched on Tara where he was declared king. Elim gave battle at the hill of Achall near Tara, but was defeated and killed. T√∫athal fought 25 battles against Ulster, 25 against Leinster, 25 against Connacht and 35 against Munster. The whole country subdued, he convened a conference at Tara, where he established laws and annexed territory from each of the four provinces to create the central province of M√≠de (Meath) around Tara as the High King's territory. He built four fortresses in Meath: Tlachtga, where the druids sacrificed on the eve of Samhain, on land taken from Munster; Uisneach, where the festival of Beltaine was celebrated, on land from Connacht; Tailtiu, where Lughnasadh was celebrated, on land from Ulster; and Tara, on land from Leinster. He went on to make war on Leinster, burning the stronghold of Aillen (D√∫n Ailinne) and imposing the b√≥rama, a heavy tribute of cattle, on the province. One story says this was because the king of Leinster, Eochaid Ainchenn, had married T√∫athal's daughter Dairine, but told T√∫athal she had died and so was given his other daughter, Fithir. When Fithir discovered Dairine was still alive she died of shame, and when Dairine saw Fithir dead she died of grief. T√∫athal, or his wife Baine, is reputed to have built R√°th M√≥r, an Iron Age hillfort in the earthwork complex at Clogher, County Tyrone. He died in battle against Mal mac Rochride, king of Ulster, at Mag Line (Moylinny near Larne, County Antrim). His son, Fedlimid Rechtmar, later avenged him. ==Historical context== ===Dates=== The Annals of the Four Masters gives the date of T√∫athal's exile as AD 56, his return as 76 and his death as 106. Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar √ârinn broadly agrees, dating his exile to 55, his return to 80 and his death to 100. The Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn places him a little later, synchronising his exile with the reign of the Roman emperor Domitian (81‚Äì96), his return early in the reign of Hadrian (122‚Äì138) and his death in the reign of Antoninus Pius (138‚Äì161). ===The first of the Goidels?=== The scholar T.

O'Rahilly suggested that, as in many such \\"returned exile\\" stories, T√∫athal represented an entirely foreign invasion which established a dynasty in Ireland, whose dynastic propagandists fabricated an Irish origin for him to give him some spurious legitimacy. In fact, he proposed that T√∫athal's story, pushed back to the 1st or 2nd century BC, represented the invasion of the Goidels, who established themselves over the earlier populations and introduced the Q-Celtic language that would become Irish, and that their genealogists incorporated all Irish dynasties, Goidelic or otherwise, and their ancestor deities into a pedigree stretching back over a thousand years to the fictitious M√≠l Esp√°ine.O'Rahilly 1946, pp. 161‚Äì170 ===Romans in Ireland?=== Taking the native dating as broadly accurate, another theory has emerged. The Roman historian Tacitus mentions that Agricola, while governor of Roman Britain (AD 78‚Äì84), entertained an exiled Irish prince, thinking to use him as a pretext for a possible conquest of Ireland.Tacitus Agricola 24 Neither Agricola nor his successors ever conquered Ireland, but in recent years archaeology has challenged the belief that the Romans never set foot on the island. Roman and Romano-British artefacts have been found primarily in Leinster, notably a fortified site on the promontory of Drumanagh, fifteen miles north of Dublin, and burials on the nearby island of Lambay, both close to where T√∫athal is supposed to have landed, and other sites associated with T√∫athal such as Tara and Clogher. However, whether this is evidence of trade, diplomacy or military activity is a matter of controversy. It is possible that the Romans may have given support to T√∫athal, or someone like him, to regain his throne in the interests of having a friendly neighbour who could restrain Irish raiding.Vittorio di Martino, Roman Ireland, The Collins Press, 2006 The 2nd-century Roman poet Juvenal, who may have served in Britain under Agricola, wrote that \\"arms had been taken beyond the shores of Ireland\\",Juvenal, Satires 2.159‚Äì160 and the coincidence of dates is striking. ==Family tree== ==See also== *Hibernia *Drumanagh *Hiberno-Roman relations ==References== ==External links== *Hibernia Romana: What did the Romans ever do for us? ‚Äì an article about the Drumanagh \\"Roman fort\\" controversy *Dr Warner reviews his theories on ‚Äòthe Roman invasion of Ireland‚Äô Category:Cycles of the Kings Category:Legendary High Kings of Ireland Category:People from County Westmeath ","title":"T√∫athal Techtmar"},{"id":"1269453","text":"Greek National Road 44 (, abbreviated as EO44) is a single carriageway road in central Greece.

It is an injectable gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRH agonist). Structurally, it is a decapeptide. It is the natural GnRH decapeptide with two substitutions to inhibit rapid degradation. Goserelin stimulates the production of the sex hormones testosterone and estrogen in a non-pulsatile (non-physiological) manner. This causes the disruption of the endogenous hormonal feedback systems, resulting in the down-regulation of testosterone and estrogen production. It was patented in 1976 and approved for medical use in 1987. ==Medical uses== 10.8mg implant syringe Goserelin is used to treat hormone-sensitive cancers of the breast (in pre- and peri-menopausal women) and prostate, and some benign gynaecological disorders (endometriosis, uterine fibroids and endometrial thinning). In addition, goserelin is used in assisted reproduction and in the treatment of precocious puberty. It may also be used in the treatment of male-to-female transgender peopleDittrich R, Binder H, Cupisti S, Hoffmann I, Beckmann MW, Mueller A. Endocrine treatment of male-to- female transsexuals using gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes 2005;113:586‚Äì92. and is favoured above other anti- androgens in some countries, such as the UK. It is available as a 1-month depot and a long-acting 3-month depot. Goserelin is administered by subcutaneous injection as an implant every 28 days for the duration of treatment. ==Side effects== Goserelin may cause a temporary increase in bone pain and symptoms of prostatic cancer during the first few weeks of treatment. This is known as the tumour flare effect, and is the result of an initial increase in luteinizing hormone production, before the receptors are desensitised and hormonal production is inhibited. The symptoms will disappear, with hormonal inhibition. It is therefore advisable to co-treat with an antiandrogen during the first 2‚Äì3 weeks of goserelin treatment, particularly in patients with pre-existing bone symptoms. Goserelin may cause bone pain, hot flushes, headache, stomach upset, depression, difficulty urinating (isolated cases), weight gain, swelling and tenderness of breasts (infrequent), decreased erections and reduced sexual desire. Bone pain can be managed symptomatically, and erectile dysfunction can be treated by vardenafil (Levitra) or other similar oral therapies, although they will not treat the reduced sexual desire. The rates of gynecomastia with goserelin have been found to range from 1 to 5%. Short-term memory impairment has also been reported in women and may in some cases be severe, but this effect disappears gradually once treatment is discontinued.Newton CR, Yuzpe AA, Timmon IS, Slota MD. Memory complaints: a side effect of continued exposure to gonadotropin- releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa).

Adverse effects of leuprolide acetate depot treatment. Fertil Steril. 1993;59(2):448-450. ==Pharmacology== Goserelin is a synthetic analogue of a naturally occurring gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Bioavailability is almost complete by injection. Goserelin is poorly protein- bound and has a serum elimination half-life of two to four hours in patients with normal renal function. The half-life increases with patients with impaired renal function. There is no significant change in pharmacokinetics in subjects with liver failure. After administration, peak serum concentrations are reached in about two hours. It rapidly binds to the GnRH receptor cells in the pituitary gland thus leading to an initial increase in production of luteinizing hormone and thus leading to an initial increase in the production of corresponding sex hormones. This initial flare may be treated by co- prescribing/co-administering an androgen receptor antagonist such as bicalutamide (Casodex). Eventually, after a period of about 14‚Äì21 days, production of LH is greatly reduced due to receptor downregulation, and sex hormones are generally reduced to castrate levels. ==Chemistry== Goserelin is a GnRH analogue and decapeptide.

Upon reaching the hilly terrain where the aviators were hiding, Lassen made several attempts to recover the aviators, but dense tree cover, enemy weapons fire and intermittent illumination frustrated his efforts. Lassen turned on the landing lights of the helicopter, despite the danger of revealing his position to the enemy. After the pilots made their way to the helicopter and with his bullet-riddled helicopter dangerously low on fuel, Lassen evaded further antiaircraft fire before landing safely at sea on board the with only five minutes of fuel left in the helicopter's fuel lines.

In 2000, at the age of 17, she shot to fame with the release of her debut single \\"Gotta Tell You\\", which reached the top five in Ireland, United Kingdom and the United States. It has since been listed in Billboards 100 Greatest Choruses of the 21st Century. Her album of the same name was released later that year and reached number four in Ireland and number nine in the UK. She has had seven top five hits in Ireland and six top ten hits in the United Kingdom. Mumba has also pursued an acting career, making her film debut in the 2002 film The Time Machine, as well as appearing in a number of Irish independent films.Samantha Mumba filmography at the Internet Movie Database She returned to music in 2013, and announced plans to release a second album in 2019. ==Early life and education== Mumba was born in Dublin, Ireland.All Music Guide to Soul, p. 486. . Her father, Peter Mumba, is from Zambia and was formerly an aircraft engineer; her mother is Irish. Mumba attended Dublin's Billie Barry Stage School from the age of three to fifteen. When Mumba was 15 she was discovered on a RT√â TV talent show Let Me Entertain You by Irish music executive Louis Walsh (manager of Boyzone and Westlife). Walsh was impressed by her talent and she was signed to Polydor Records. She subsequently spent several months moving between Denmark, Sweden, UK, and Ireland, where she co-wrote and recorded her debut album, Gotta Tell You. She eventually dropped out of school to focus on her music career, explaining that it was becoming difficult to stay in school and work on her music. ==Career== Mumba sings contralto.Rock N Roll Gold Rush: A Singles Un-Cyclopedia, by Maury Dean Her first single, \\"Gotta Tell You\\", was released in 2000 and peaked at number one in Ireland and New Zealand, number two in the UK, number three in Australia, and number four in the US, as well as reaching the top twenty in several countries across Europe. \\"Gotta Tell You\\" has since been listed in Billboards 100 Catchiest Choruses of the 21st Century At the age of 17 Mumba released her debut album, Gotta Tell You, in late 2000. The album reached the top ten in both Ireland and the UK, and number 67 on the Billboard 200. Following the success of Gotta Tell You, she was chosen to play Mara in The Time Machine. Directed by Simon Wells, H.G.Wells' great-grandson, Samantha co-starred with Guy Pearce and her real-life brother, Omero. At the Teen Choice Awards in 2001 and 2002, she was nominated for Choice Music: Best Breakout Artist and Choice Movie: Best Breakout Artist for the film The Time Machine, respectively. Mumba and fellow teen star Aaron Carter performed a concert at Disney MGM Studios for the Disney Channel titled Aaron Carter and Samantha Mumba in Concert, which was then released on DVD. A year later, she and Carter also appeared on an episode of All That. In 2001, Mumba contributed to the track \\"You Raise Me Up\\" by the Celtic Tenors. An EP titled Samantha Sings Christmas was released at Christmas 2001, which included covers of \\"White Christmas\\" and \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\\". Samantha Sings Christmas was also included as a bonus disc on some editions of Gotta Tell You. In 2002, Mumba released a new single \\"I'm Right Here\\". The video features Damian Marley, son of Bob Marley. The single became Mumba's fifth UK and Irish top five single. Rumours circulated that Mumba was getting ready to release a second album, Woman and that due to the poor sales of the lead single \\"I'm Right Here\\" in the US and a short lived time on the UK chart, she was dropped from her label. However, Mumba has since confirmed she was unable to release any new material anyway, due to contract restrictions following the restructure of Polydor Records, which resulted in her being dropped. In 2007, she stated on the Late Late Show that there never was a second album, and the tracks leaked on the internet were attempts by her to find a new sound. Mumba's second venture into films was in 2003, where she appeared in the film Spin the Bottle. In October 2006, a compilation album, The Collection, was released. The album features songs from Gotta Tell You, B-sides and two new tracks including her single \\"I'm Right Here\\".

On 16 August 2013 she appeared on the RT√â television show The Hit to compete for a spot in the show's final. The song selected for chart battle was \\"Somebody Like Me\\" which was released on iTunes immediately afterwards and competed against \\"Thinking of You\\" by Irish band Republic of Loose. The song peaked at number five on the Irish Singles Chart, marking her first hit single in 11 years. On 25 June 2015, Mumba played a gig as part of the Dublin Pride Festival. In early 2017, she participated in a celebrity version of MasterChef Ireland and went on to fill in as co-host on The 6 O'Clock Show while Lucy Kennedy took maternity leave. In 2018, she made her comeback onto British television, firstly as a guest and then a panellist on Loose Women and has confirmed her return to music, sharing pictures of herself in the studio with the likes of Wanya Morris and MNEK. In January 2019 she confirmed that she hoped to release a second album before the end of the year, but this did not happen. ==Modelling== Shortly after the success of Gotta Tell You, Mumba became the face of Reebok appearing in print advertising in the UK and Ireland for the Quest range.ShowbizIreland: Samantha Mumba's Quest To Be J-LO , Showbizireland.com, retrieved 28 May 2008 Around the same time, Mumba was also seen as the face of the fashion designer Louise Kennedy's spring/summer collection.

One of five members of the Genus Colobus which are the black-and-white colobuses. Among all African colobus monkey species, the King colobus (and the Western Red Colobus) is the westernmost species on the continent of Africa. It eats mainly leaves, but also fruits and flowers. Though it is arboreal, it eats primarily on the ground. It lives in small groups consisting of 3 to 4 females and 1 to 3 males, plus their young. These groups maintain distance from one another through territorial calling. ==Etymology== The word 'Colobus' comes from the Greek word for 'mutilated', as all Colobus monkeys only have a short stump where the thumb would be. The word 'poly' comes from the Greek word for 'many.' The word 'komos' comes from the Greek celebration of unrestrained singing. A possible subspecies known as C. p. dollmani can be found but is most likely a hybrid with C. vellerosus. ==Description== ===Body Size=== The male king colobus grows to a head-and-body length of , with a tail of between . The female is slightly smaller. Males weigh an average of 9.90 kg and females weigh an average of 8.30 kg. ===Coloration=== The body is black, the limbs and fingers are long and the tail is white. There is a fringe of silvery hair around the face as well as long white \\"epaulettes\\" on its shoulders. The king colobus can be distinguished from other members of the Colobus genus by the placement of its white markings. The king colobus has white only on its whiskers, chest, and tail, and its tail is not covered by a tuft. ==Distribution and habitat== The king colobus monkey is found in lowland and montane tropical rainforests. The region in which they inhabit is limited to a small range on the Ivory Coast up to Gambia. They can also be found in Senegal, through Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Much of the habitat of the ‚ÄúC. polykomos‚Äù has been destroyed by humans for farming and secondary forests have begun to fill in this area. The forest habitats of the organism experiences significant dry seasons and two rainfall peaks. This area is dominated by leguminous trees. ==Behaviour and Biology== ===Diet=== Diet consists mainly of arboreal leaves, but includes fruit and flowers depending on the season. It can be found foraging on the groundand typically stays within a foraging path of approximately 500 meters. ===Social structure=== It lives in small groups of less than 4 females and 1 to 3 males. Unlike males, females interact closely: males rarely interact and try to show dominance. ===Activity=== The king colobus have an average home range of 22 hectares with some overlap between groups. Groups rarely encounter other groups of the same species but when they do, males engage in aggressive displays. Territorial calling is a common form of aggression but can also be a warning to the group of predators. ===Reproduction=== The king colobus live in a unimale (polygynous) and multimale (polygynandrous) mating system. Some groups have shown year round births while others have shown births in relation to the dry seasons. The average gestation period is 175 days and the females produce 1 offspring every 20 months. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at approximately 730 days or 2 years. Females provide the parental care by providing milk, grooming, protection and carry the newborns as they cannot walk immediately. . ===Lifespan=== King Colobus have been shown to live approximately 23.5 years in captivity and possibly around 30 years in the wild. ==Status and Conservation== The king colobus has a moderate-sized range; it used to be a common and widespread species but numbers have declined over the last few decades. The main cause for the decline is hunting which is threatening and fragmenting populations. The 19th century exhibited hunting of the ‚ÄúC. polykomos‚Äù for its fur. There is also a continuing decline in the quality and quantity of the forested habitat where it lives; it seems to be largely restricted to primary forest and gallery forest, although it sometimes visits secondary forest. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being endangerd. Maintaining this species in captivity has mostly failed and focus has been on managing the habitats to prevent further degradation and habitat destruction that could harm the species. ==References== ==External links== king colobus Category:Mammals of West Africa king colobus Category:Taxa named by Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann ","title":"King colobus"},{"id":"1269516","text":"The Bierpinsel, or beer brush as some people call it, is a 47 meter high building that fitted in 1970s Steglitz, with its futuristic architecture.

Before joining the Nazi Party in 1932, he worked as a teacher and editor. == Nazi career == In 1936, he joined the SS and became involved in the SD administration. In 1940, he was appointed the senior commander of security in Paris. In 1942, the jurisdiction under his control stretched from northern France to Belgium. He was promoted to the rank of Standartenf√ºhrer in the same year. Knochen was involved in the deportation of French Jews to concentration camps and was responsible for the execution of thousands of Frenchmen. He was responsible for the arrest and torture of SOE agents. During the plot to assassinate Hitler of July 20, 1944, together with the top security man in Paris, SS General Carl Oberg, he was arrested by Army troops under the command of Paris military governor, General Carl-Heinrich von St√ºlpnagel. He was released after the coup collapsed. Following the liberation of Paris, Knochen was transferred to the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler and he was degraded to the rank of SS Grenadier. == Post-war trials, sentences, and reprieve == In March 1947, a British Military Court sentenced Knochen to death for the murder of a number of British parachute troops on or around 9 August 1944. However, on 16 September 1948, the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, and further commuted in February 1950 to 21 years imprisonment. He was extradited to France in 1954 and sentenced to death. The sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. After he obtained a presidential pardon in 1958, Knochen was released on November 28, 1962 by President Charles de Gaulle, simultaneously with his former chief Carl Oberg. Back in Germany he retired to Baden-Baden and died a free man in 2003.

The castle's name was first noted in 1265 and was rebuilt for the last time in 1432 by the craftsmen's guild that worked in the town.

It is also being studied for other types of cancer. It has been used for Albright syndrome. Tamoxifen is typically taken daily by mouth for five years for breast cancer. Serious side effects include a small increased risk of uterine cancer, stroke, vision problems, and pulmonary embolism. Common side effects include irregular periods, weight loss, and hot flashes. It may cause harm to the baby if taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM) and works by decreasing the growth of breast cancer cells. It is a member of the triphenylethylene group of compounds. Tamoxifen was initially made in 1962, by chemist Dora Richardson. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Tamoxifen is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 251st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions. ==Medical uses== ===Dysmenorrhea=== Tamoxifen has been used effectively to improve blood flow, reduce uterine contractility and pain in dysmenorrhea patients. ===Breast cancer=== Tamoxifen is used for the treatment of both early and advanced estrogen receptor- positive (ER-positive or ER+) breast cancer in pre- and post-menopausal women. Additionally, it is the most common hormone treatment for male breast cancer. It is also approved by the FDA for the prevention of breast cancer in women at high risk of developing the disease. It has been further approved for the reduction of contralateral (in the opposite breast) cancer. The use of tamoxifen is recommended for 10 years. In 2006, the large STAR clinical study concluded that raloxifene is also effective in reducing the incidence of breast cancer. Updated results after an average of 6.75 years of follow up found that raloxifene retains 76% of tamoxifen's effectiveness in preventing invasive breast cancer, with 45% fewer uterine cancers and 25% fewer blood clots in women taking raloxifene than in women taking tamoxifen. ===Infertility=== Tamoxifen is used for ovulation induction to treat infertility in women with anovulatory disorders. It is given at days three to seven of a woman's cycle. Tamoxifen improves fertility in males with infertility by disinhibiting the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis (HPG axis) via ER antagonism and thereby increasing the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and increasing testicular testosterone production. ===Gynecomastia=== Tamoxifen is used to prevent and treat gynecomastia. It is taken as a preventative measure in small doses, or used at the onset of any symptoms such as nipple soreness or sensitivity. Other medications are taken for similar purposes such as clomifene and the anti-aromatase drugs which are used in order to try to avoid the hormone- related adverse effects. ===Early puberty=== Tamoxifen is useful in the treatment of peripheral precocious puberty, for instance due to McCune‚ÄìAlbright syndrome, in both girls and boys. It has been found to decrease growth velocity and the rate of bone maturation in girls with precocious puberty, and hence to improve final height in these individuals. ===Available forms=== Nolvadex (tamoxifen) 20 mg tablets. Tamoxifen is available as a tablet or oral solution.Product Information: tamoxifen citrate oral tablets, tamoxifen citrate oral tablets. Watson Laboratories (per manufacturer), Corona, CA, 2011.Product Information: SOLTAMOX(R) oral solution, tamoxifen citrate oral solution. Midatech Pharma US Inc (per FDA), Raleigh, NC, 2018. ==Contraindications== Tamoxifen has a number of contraindications, including known hypersensitivity to tamoxifen or other ingredients, individuals taking concomitant coumarin-type anticoagulant therapy, and women with a history of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism). ==Side effects== A report in September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and tibolone used to treat breast cancer significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects. ===Endometrial cancer=== Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Even though it is an antagonist in breast tissue it acts as partial agonist on the endometrium and has been linked to endometrial cancer in some women. Therefore, endometrial changes, including cancer, are among tamoxifen's side effects. With time, risk of endometrial cancer may be doubled to quadrupled, which is a reason tamoxifen is typically only used for five years. The American Cancer Society lists tamoxifen as a known carcinogen, stating that it increases the risk of some types of uterine cancer while lowering the risk of breast cancer recurrence. ===Cardiovascular and metabolic=== Tamoxifen treatment of postmenopausal women is associated with beneficial effects on serum lipid profiles. However, long-term data from clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a cardioprotective effect. For some women, tamoxifen can cause a rapid increase in triglyceride concentration in the blood. In addition, there is an increased risk of thromboembolism especially during and immediately after major surgery or periods of immobility. Use of tamoxifen has been shown to slightly increase risk of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. ===Liver toxicity=== Tamoxifen has been associated with a number of cases of hepatotoxicity. Several different varieties of hepatotoxicity have been reported. Tamoxifen can also precipitate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in obese and overweight women (not in normal weight women) at an average rate of 40% after a year use with 20mg/day. ==Research== ===Prevention of bone loss=== A beneficial side effect of tamoxifen is that it prevents bone loss by acting as an ER agonist (i.e., mimicking the effects of estrogen) in this cell type. Therefore, by inhibiting osteoclasts, it prevents osteoporosis. When tamoxifen was launched as a drug, it was thought that tamoxifen would act as an ER antagonist in all tissue, including bone, and therefore it was feared that it would contribute to osteoporosis. It was therefore very surprising that the opposite effect was observed clinically. Hence tamoxifen's tissue selective action directly led to the formulation of the concept of SERMs. ==Overdose== Acute overdose of tamoxifen has not been reported in humans. In dose-ranging studies, tamoxifen was administered at very high doses in women (e.g., 300 mg/m2) and was found to produce acute neurotoxicity including tremor, hyperreflexia, unsteady gait, and dizziness. These symptoms occurred within three to five days of therapy and disappeared within two to five days of discontinuation of therapy. No indications of permanent neurotoxicity were observed. QT prolongation was also observed with very high doses of tamoxifen. There is no specific antidote for overdose of tamoxifen. Instead, treatment should be based on symptoms. == Interactions == Patients with variant forms of the gene CYP2D6 (also called simply 2D6) may not receive full benefit from tamoxifen because of too slow metabolism of the tamoxifen prodrug into its active metabolites. On 18 October 2006, the Subcommittee for Clinical Pharmacology recommended relabeling tamoxifen to include information about this gene in the package insert.Information about CYP2D6 and tamoxifen from DNADirect's website Certain CYP2D6 variations in breast cancer patients lead to a worse clinical outcome for tamoxifen treatment. Genotyping therefore has the potential for identification of women who have these CYP2D6 phenotypes and for whom the use of tamoxifen is associated with poor outcomes. Recent studies suggest that taking the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), and sertraline (Zoloft) can decrease the effectiveness of tamoxifen, as these drugs compete for the CYP2D6 enzyme which is needed to metabolize tamoxifen into its active forms. A U.S. study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting in 2009 found that after two years, 7.5% of women who took only tamoxifen had a recurrence, compared with 16% who took either paroxetine, fluoxetine or sertraline, drugs considered to be the most potent CYP2D6 inhibitors. That difference translates to a 120% increase in the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Patients taking the SSRIs; Celexa (citalopram), Lexapro (escitalopram), and Luvox (fluvoxamine), did not have an increased risk of recurrence, due to their lack of competitive metabolism for the CYP2D6 enzyme. A newer study demonstrated a clearer and stronger effect from paroxetine in causing the worst outcomes. Patients treated with both paroxetine and tamoxifen have a 67% increased risk of death from breast cancer, from 24% to 91%, depending on the duration of coadministration. Recent research has shown that 7‚Äì10% of women with breast cancer may not receive the full medical benefit from taking tamoxifen due to their genetic make-up. DNA Drug Safety Testing can examine DNA variations in the CYP2D6 and other important drug processing pathways. More than 20% of all clinically used medications are metabolized by CYP2D6 and knowing the CYP2D6 status of a person can help the doctor with the future selection of medications.Information about Tamoxitest and how DNA testing can help in the selection of the best treatment methodology from Genelex's website Other molecular biomarkers may also be used to select appropriate patients likely to benefit from tamoxifen. Tamoxifen interacts with certain other antiestrogens. The aromatase inhibitor aminoglutethimide induces the metabolism of tamoxifen. Conversely, the aromatase inhibitor letrozole does not affect the metabolism of tamoxifen. However, tamoxifen induces the metabolism of letrozole and significantly reduces its concentrations. ==Pharmacology== ===Pharmacodynamics=== ====Selective estrogen receptor modulator activity==== Crystallographic structure of afimoxifene (carbon = white, oxygen = red, nitrogen = blue) complexed with ligand binding domain of estrogen receptor alpha (ERŒ±) (cyan ribbon).; Tamoxifen acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), or as a partial agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs). It has mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity, with its profile of effects differing by tissue. For instance, tamoxifen has predominantly antiestrogenic effects in the breasts but predominantly estrogenic effects in the uterus and liver. In breast tissue, tamoxifen acts as an ER antagonist so that transcription of estrogen-responsive genes is inhibited. Tamoxifen has relatively little affinity for the ERs itself and instead acts as a prodrug of active metabolites such as afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen; 4-OHT) and endoxifen (N-desmethyl-4-hydroxytamoxifen). These metabolites have approximately 30 to 100 times greater affinity for the ERs as tamoxifen itself. Tamoxifen has 7% and 6% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤, respectively, whereas afimoxifene has 178% and 338% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤, respectively. Hence, afimoxifine has 25-fold higher affinity for the ERŒ± and 56-fold higher affinity for the ERŒ≤ than tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is a long- acting SERM, with a nuclear retention of the ER‚Äìtamoxifen complex of greater than 48 hours. Afimoxifene binds to ER, the ER/tamoxifen complex recruits other proteins known as co-repressors, and the complex then binds to DNA to modulate gene expression. Some of these proteins include NCoR and SMRT. Tamoxifen function can be regulated by a number of different variables including growth factors. Tamoxifen needs to block growth factor proteins such as ErbB2/HER2 because high levels of ErbB2 have been shown to occur in tamoxifen resistant cancers. Tamoxifen seems to require a protein PAX2 for its full anticancer effect. In the presence of high PAX2 expression, the tamoxifen/ER complex is able to suppress the expression of the pro- proliferative ERBB2 protein. In contrast, when AIB-1 expression is higher than PAX2, tamoxifen/ER complex upregulates the expression of ERBB2 resulting in stimulation of breast cancer growth. Afimoxifene binds to ER competitively (with respect to the endogenous agonist estrogen) in tumor cells and other tissue targets, producing a nuclear complex that decreases DNA synthesis and inhibits estrogen effects. It is a nonsteroidal agent with potent antiestrogenic properties which compete with estrogen for binding sites in breast and other tissues. Tamoxifen causes cells to remain in the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle. Because it prevents (pre)cancerous cells from dividing but does not cause cell death, tamoxifen is cytostatic rather than cytocidal. Tamoxifen has been found to decrease insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels by 17 to 38% in women and men. Suppression of IGF-1 production in the liver is a well-known action of estrogens and SERMs. A 10 mg/day dosage of tamoxifen is nearly as effective as a 20 mg/day dosage in suppressing IGF-1 levels. The effects of tamoxifen on breast cancer Ki-67 expression, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, and IGF-1 levels are dose-dependent across a dosage range of one to 20 mg/day in women with breast cancer. Tamoxifen is antigonadotropic in postmenopausal women and partially suppresses levels of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in such women. However, it has progonadotropic effects in premenopausal women and increases estrogen levels by 6-fold in them. Due to the nature of tamoxifen as a competitive ER ligand, this increase in estrogen levels is liable to interfere with the antiestrogenic efficacy of tamoxifen. ====Other activities==== Afimoxifene is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) with relatively low affinity (100‚Äì1,000 nM, relative to 3‚Äì6 nM for estradiol). Norendoxifen (N,N-didesmethyl-4-hydroxytamoxifen), another active metabolite of tamoxifen, has been found to act as a potent competitive aromatase inhibitor (IC50 = 90 nM), and may also be involved in the antiestrogenic activity of tamoxifen. In addition to its activity as a SERM, tamoxifen is a potent and selective protein kinase C inhibitor, and is active in this regard at therapeutic concentrations. This action is thought to underlie the efficacy of tamoxifen in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Tamoxifen is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. ===Pharmacokinetics=== Tamoxifen is rapidly and extensively absorbed from the intestines with oral administration. The oral bioavailability of tamoxifen is high at approximately 100%, which is suggestive of minimal first-pass metabolism in the intestines and liver. Following intake, peak levels of tamoxifen occur after three to seven hours. Steady state levels of tamoxifen are reached typically after three to four weeks but possibly up to 16 weeks of daily administration. Steady state levels of afimoxifene are achieved after 8 weeks of daily tamoxifen administration. The volume of distribution of tamoxifen is 50 to 60 L/kg and its clearance has been estimated as 1.2 to 5.1 L/hour. High concentrations of tamoxifen have been found in breast, uterus, liver, kidney, lung, pancreas, and ovary tissue in animals and humans. Levels of tamoxifen in the uterus have been found to be 2- to 3-fold higher than in the circulation. The plasma protein binding of tamoxifen and afimoxifene is greater than 99%. A majority of tamoxifen is bound to albumin. Tamoxifen itself is a prodrug is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 into active metabolites such as afimoxifene and endoxifen. Tamoxifen and its metabolites undergo conjugation, including glucuronidation and sulfation. Tamoxifen may inhibit its own metabolism. Tamoxifen has a long elimination half-life of typically five to seven days, with a range of four to eleven days. Similarly, the half-life of afimoxifene is 14 days. Conversely, the half-life of endoxifen is 50 to 70 hours. The long half-lives of tamoxifen and afimoxifene are attributed to their high plasma protein binding as well as to enterohepatic recirculation. Upon discontinuation of treatment, levels of tamoxifen and its metabolites persist in the circulation for at least 6 weeks. Tamoxifen is excreted in bile and is eliminated in feces, while small amounts are eliminated in urine. ==Chemistry== Tamoxifen is a nonsteroidal SERM of the triphenylethylene family and was structurally derived from diethylstilbestrol- like estrogens and antiestrogens such as chlorotrianisene and ethamoxytriphetol. Initially, clomifene was synthesized, and tamoxifen was developed subsequently. Tamoxifen is closely related structurally to other triphenylethylenes, such as clomifene, nafoxidine, ospemifene, toremifene, and numerous others. Other SERMs, like raloxifene, are structurally distinct from tamoxifen and other triphenylethylenes. ==History== In the late 1950s, pharmaceutical companies were actively researching a newly discovered class of anti-estrogen compounds in the hope of developing a morning-after contraceptive pill. Arthur L Walpole was a reproductive endocrinologist who led such a team at the Alderley Park research laboratories of ICI Pharmaceuticals. It was there in 1962 that chemist Dora Richardson first synthesized tamoxifen, back then known as ICI-46,474, when she was looking to create triphenylethylene derivatives for the contraceptive pill project that her team was researching. This compound was originally created to work as an estrogen inhibitor, but instead was found to stimulate ovulation in participants of the drug testing trial. Walpole and his colleagues filed a UK patent covering this compound in 1962, but patent protection on this compound was repeatedly denied in the US until the 1980s. Tamoxifen did eventually receive marketing approval as a fertility treatment, but the class of compounds never proved useful in human contraception. A link between estrogen and breast cancer had been known for many years, but cancer treatments were not a corporate priority at the time, and Walpole's personal interests were important in keeping support for the compound alive in the face of this and the lack of patent protection. It was only when Walpole threatened to leave his position that corporate decided to allow trials and testing for Tamoxifen as a drug that could be used to treat breast cancer. Without Walpole's effort towards defending the work that his team had done in discovering a possibly revolutionary source for breast cancer treatment, Tamoxifen could have become a discarded or under-researched idea. Walpole's team consisted of Dora Richardson and G.A. Snow, who worked on the chemistry portion of the project, along with G.E. Paget and J.K. Walley, who focused primarily on the biological side. Tamoxifen is one of three drugs in an anti-angiogenetic protocol developed by Dr. Judah Folkman, a researcher at Children's Hospital at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Folkman discovered in the 1970s that angiogenesis ‚Äì the growth of new blood vessels ‚Äì plays a significant role in the development of cancer. Since his discovery, an entirely new field of cancer research has developed. Clinical trials on angiogenesis inhibitors have been underway since 1992 using many different drugs. The Harvard researchers developed a specific protocol for a golden retriever named Navy who was cancer-free after receiving the prescribed cocktail of celecoxib, doxycycline, and tamoxifen ‚Äì the treatment subsequently became known as the Navy Protocol. Furthermore, tamoxifen treatment alone has been shown to have anti-angiogenetic effects in animal models of cancer which appear to be, at least in part, independent of tamoxifen's ER antagonist properties. Other antiestrogens, such as ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) and clomifene (MRL-41), were assessed for treatment of breast cancer and found to be effective before tamoxifen, but were plagued with toxicity issues. The first clinical study of tamoxifen took place at the Christie Hospital in 1971, and showed a convincing effect in advanced breast cancer, but nevertheless ICI's development programme came close to termination when it was reviewed in 1972. In an unpublished article from the early days of the trial, Dora Richardson documented her team's excitement about tamoxifen's effects in counteracting infertility problems and the early positive effects found in breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, this work was not well received by everyone, as the team was supposed to be looking for a contraceptive pill. Tamoxifen's further development may have been bolstered by a second clinical study by Harold W.C. Ward at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. Ward's study showed a more definitive response to the drug at a higher dosage. Walpole also may have helped to convince the company to market tamoxifen for late stage breast cancer in 1973. He was also instrumental in funding V. Craig Jordan to work on tamoxifen. In 1972, ICI Pharmaceuticals Division abandoned development of tamoxifen for financial reasons. The drug was subsequently reinvented from a failed contraceptive, to become tamoxifen, the gold standard for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer and the pioneering medicine for chemprevention for high risk women. Two books, Estrogen Action, Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators and Women's Health (Imperial College Press 2013) and Tamoxifen Pioneering Medicine in Breast Cancer (Springer 2013) tell this story. 1980 saw the publication of the first trial to show that tamoxifen given in addition to chemotherapy improved survival for patients with early breast cancer. In advanced disease, tamoxifen is now only recognized as effective in ER+ patients, but the early trials did not select ER+ patients, and by the mid 1980s the clinical trial picture was not showing a major advantage for tamoxifen. Nevertheless, tamoxifen had a relatively mild side-effect profile, and a number of large trials continued. The pharmacology of SERMs was discovered, defined, and deciphered during the 1980s A clinical strategy was described that led to the creation of SERMs as a group of multifunctional medicines aimed at the treatment or prevention of many conditions in postmenopausal women, e.g. osteoporosis and breast cancer. This story is told in: V. Craig Jordan, ed. 2013. \\"Estrogen Action, Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators and Women's Health\\" Imperial College Press, Singapore. The early sales of tamoxifen in both the UK and in the U.S. far exceeded ICI's original estimate, but despite this, at the annual portfolio review ICI's board members still asserted that \\"there was no market for cancer\\", leaving the drug's marketing success to rely on its clinical results and clinicians and scientists interests in it. Shortly after, Dora Richardson published a history of Tamoxifen that, unusually for that type of paper, included personal accounts and letters from patients who attributed their healing to the drug. It is by giving voice to cancer patients using Tamoxifen, and so helping to push it forward, by justifying it both morally and scientifically to corporations. It was not until 1998 that the meta-analysis of the Oxford-based Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group showed definitively that tamoxifen saved lives in early breast cancer. ==Society and culture== ===Brand names=== Tamoxifen is marketed primarily under the brand name Nolvadex, but is also available under a variety of other brand names throughout the world. ===Economics=== Global sales of tamoxifen in 2001 were $1,024 million. Since the expiration of the patent in 2002, it is widely available as a generic drug around the world. , tamoxifen was the world's largest selling hormonal drug for the treatment of breast cancer. ==Research== In McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) tamoxifen has been used to treat premature puberty and the consequences of premature puberty. Tamoxifen has been seen to decrease rapid bone maturation which is the result of excessive estrogen and alter predicted adult height (PAH). The same effects have also been seen in short pubertal boys. However, one in vitro study in 2007 and later an in vivo study in 2008 have shown that tamoxifen induces apoptosis in growth plate chondrocytes, reduces serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels and causes persistent retardation of longitudinal and cortical radial bone growth in young male rats, leading the researchers to express concern giving tamoxifen to growing individuals. Tamoxifen has been studied in the treatment of the rare conditions of retroperitoneal fibrosis and idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis. It has also been proposed as part of a treatment plan for Riedel's thyroiditis. Tamoxifen is used as a research tool to trigger tissue- specific gene expression in many conditional expression constructs in genetically modified animals including a version of the Cre-Lox recombination technique. Tamoxifen may be effective in the treatment of mania in people with bipolar disorder. This is thought to be due to blockade of protein kinase C (PKC), an enzyme that regulates neuron activity in the brain. Researchers believe PKC is overactive during the mania in bipolar patients. , endoxifen, a major active metabolite of tamoxifen with a fourfold more potent PKC inhibition, was in phase III clinical trials for bipolar disorder. == References == ==Further reading== * == External links == * Category:Aromatase inhibitors Category:AstraZeneca brands Category:Chemopreventive agents Category:Glycine receptor agonists Category:GPER agonists Category:Hepatotoxins Category:Hormonal antineoplastic drugs Category:IARC Group 1 carcinogens Category:Mood stabilizers Category:Phenol ethers Category:Prodrugs Category:Progonadotropins Category:Selective estrogen receptor modulators Category:Triphenylethylenes Category:World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited substances Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Tamoxifen"},{"id":"1269565","text":"Double dot or .. may refer to: * Double dotting in a dotted note * Ellipsis (computer programming) * Leader (typography) * A second derivative in Newton's notation * A parent directory in a relative path ","title":"Double dot"},{"id":"1269585","text":"Location of Enskede-√Örsta Enskede-√Örsta was a borough (stadsdelsomr√•de) in the southern part of Stockholm, Sweden from 1998 to 1 January 2007.

He was born in , a city in Khorasan in eastern Persia. Both his grandfather and his father, Baha al-Din, had held the post of sahib-divan or Minister of Finance for Muhammad Jalal al- Din and √ñgedei Khan respectively. Baha al-Din also acted as deputy c. 1246 for his immediate superior, the emir Arghun, in which role he oversaw a large area including Kingdom of Georgia. Juvayni too became an important official of the empire. He visited the Mongol capital of Karakorum twice, beginning his history of the Mongols conquests on one such visit (c. 1252-53). He was with Ilkhan Hulagu in the 1256 campaign at the taking of Alamut and was responsible for saving part of its celebrated library. He had also accompanied Hulagu during the sack of Baghdad in 1258, and the next year was appointed governor of Baghdad, Lower Mesopotamia, and Khuzistan. Around 1282, Juvayni attended a Mongol quriltai, or assembly, held in the Ala-Taq pastures northeast of Lake Van. He died the following year in Mughan or Arran in Azerbaijan. 150 years after the castle of Alamut became the headquarters of the Nizaris,  øA·π≠ƒÅ-Malik Juwaynƒ´, who was H≈´lƒÅg≈´ KhƒÅn‚Äôs attendant and historian, visited the well-known Alamut library. He tells us about the plethora of Ismaili religious books and texts he found there, writing about the extensive literary production. However, when the Mongols invaded Alamut and destroyed the Ismaili capital, the library of Alamut was burned. Only copies of the Qur æƒÅn and a few other treatises were saved. Juvayni's brother was the powerful Shams al-Din Mohammad Sahib-Divan, who had served as Minister of Finance under Hulagu and Abaqa Khan. A skillful leader in his own right, Shams al-Din also had influential in-laws: his wife Khoshak was the daughter of Avag Mkhargrdzeli, Lord High Constable of Georgia, and Gvantsa, a noblewoman who went on to become queen of Georgia. Juvayni's own position at court and his family connections made him privy to information unavailable to other historians.

Altitude training is the practice by some endurance athletes of training for several weeks at high altitude, preferably over above sea level, though more commonly at intermediate altitudes due to the shortage of suitable high-altitude locations. At intermediate altitudes, the air still contains approximately 20.9% oxygen, but the barometric pressure and thus the partial pressure of oxygen is reduced. Depending on the protocols used, the body may acclimate to the relative lack of oxygen in one or more ways such as increasing the mass of red blood cells and hemoglobin, or altering muscle metabolism. Proponents claim that when such athletes travel to competitions at lower altitudes they will still have a higher concentration of red blood cells for 10‚Äì14 days, and this gives them a competitive advantage. Some athletes live permanently at high altitude, only returning to sea level to compete, but their training may suffer due to less available oxygen for workouts. Altitude training can be simulated through use of an altitude simulation tent, altitude simulation room, or mask-based hypoxicator system where the barometric pressure is kept the same, but the oxygen content is reduced which also reduces the partial pressure of oxygen. Hypoventilation training, which consists of reducing the breathing frequency while exercising, can also mimic altitude training by significantly decreasing blood and muscle oxygenation.Xavier Woorons, \\"Hypoventilation training, push your limits!\\", Arpeh, 2014, 176 p () == Background history == Altitude training in a low- pressure room in East Germany The study of altitude training was heavily delved into during and after the 1968 Olympics, which took place in Mexico City, Mexico: elevation . It was during these Olympic Games that endurance events saw significant below-record finishes while anaerobic, sprint events broke all types of records. It was speculated prior to these events how the altitude might affect performances of these elite, world-class athletes and most of the conclusions drawn were equivalent to those hypothesized: that endurance events would suffer and that short events would not see significant negative changes. This was attributed not only to less resistance during movement‚Äîdue to the less dense air‚Äîbut also to the anaerobic nature of the sprint events. Ultimately, these games inspired investigations into altitude training from which unique training principles were developed with the aim of avoiding underperformance. ==Training regimens== Athletes or individuals who wish to gain a competitive edge for endurance events can take advantage of exercising at high altitude. High altitude is typically defined as any elevation above . ===Live-high, train-low=== One suggestion for optimizing adaptations and maintaining performance is the live-high, train-low principle. This training idea involves living at higher altitudes in order to experience the physiological adaptations that occur, such as increased erythropoietin (EPO) levels, increased red blood cell levels, and higher VO2 max, while maintaining the same exercise intensity during training at sea level. Due to the environmental differences at high altitude, it may be necessary to decrease the intensity of workouts. Studies examining the live-high, train-low theory have produced varied results, which may be dependent on a variety of factors such as individual variability, time spent at high altitude, and the type of training program. For example, it has been shown that athletes performing primarily anaerobic activity do not necessarily benefit from altitude training as they do not rely on oxygen to fuel their performances. A non-training elevation of and training at or less has shown to be the optimal approach for altitude training. Good venues for live-high train-low include Mammoth Lakes, California; Flagstaff, Arizona; and the Sierra Nevada, near Granada in Spain. Altitude training can produce increases in speed, strength, endurance, and recovery by maintaining altitude exposure for a significant period of time. A study using simulated altitude exposure for 18 days, yet training closer to sea-level, showed performance gains were still evident 15 days later. Opponents of altitude training argue that an athlete's red blood cell concentration returns to normal levels within days of returning to sea level and that it is impossible to train at the same intensity that one could at sea level, reducing the training effect and wasting training time due to altitude sickness. Altitude training can produce slow recovery due to the stress of hypoxia. Exposure to extreme hypoxia at altitudes above can lead to considerable deterioration of skeletal muscle tissue. Five weeks at this altitude leads to a loss of muscle volume of the order of 10‚Äì15%. ===Live- high, train-high=== In the live-high, train-high regime, an athlete lives and trains at a desired altitude. The stimulus on the body is constant because the athlete is continuously in a hypoxic environment. Initially VO2 max drops considerably: by around 7% for every 1000 m above sea level) at high altitudes. Athletes will no longer be able to metabolize as much oxygen as they would at sea level. Any given velocity must be performed at a higher relative intensity at altitude. ===Repeated sprints in hypoxia === In repeated sprints in hypoxia (RSH), athletes run short sprints under 30 seconds as fast as they can. They experience incomplete recoveries in hypoxic conditions. The exercise to rest time ratio is less than 1:4, which means for every 30 second all out sprint, there is less than 120 seconds of rest. When comparing RSH and repeated sprints in normoxia (RSN), studies show that RSH improved time to fatigue and power output. RSH and RSN groups were tested before and after a 4-week training period. Both groups initially completed 9‚Äì10 all-out sprints before total exhaustion. After the 4 week training period, the RSH group was able to complete 13 all out sprints before exhaustion and the RSN group only completed 9. Possible physiological advantages from RSH include compensatory vasodilation and regeneration of phosphocreatine (PCr). The body's tissues have the ability to sense hypoxia and induce vasodilation. The higher blood flow helps the skeletal muscles maximize oxygen delivery. A greater level of PCr resynthesis augments the muscles power production during the initial stages of high-intensity exercise. RSH is still a relatively new training method and is not fully understood. ===Artificial altitude=== Altitude simulation systems have enabled protocols that do not suffer from the tension between better altitude physiology and more intense workouts. Such simulated altitude systems can be utilized closer to competition if necessary. In Finland, a scientist named Heikki Rusko has designed a \\"high-altitude house.\\" The air inside the house, which is situated at sea level, is at normal pressure but modified to have a low concentration of oxygen, about 15.3% (below the 20.9% at sea level), which is roughly equivalent to the amount of oxygen available at the high altitudes often used for altitude training due to the reduced partial pressure of oxygen at altitude. Athletes live and sleep inside the house, but perform their training outside (at normal oxygen concentrations at 20.9%). Rusko's results show improvements of EPO and red- cell levels. Artificial altitude can also be used for hypoxic exercise, where athletes train in an altitude simulator which mimics the conditions a high altitude environment. Athletes are able to perform high intensity training at lower velocities and thus produce less stress on the musculoskeletal system. This is beneficial to an athlete who suffered a musculoskeletal injury and is unable to apply large amounts of stress during exercise which would normally be needed to generate high intensity cardiovascular training. Hypoxia exposure for the time of exercise alone is not sufficient to induce changes in hematologic parameters. Hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations remain in general unchanged. There are a number of companies who provide altitude training system, most notably Hypoxico, Inc. who pioneered the artificial altitude training systems in the mid 1990s. A South African scientist named Neil Stacey has proposed the opposite approach, using oxygen enrichment to provide a training environment with an oxygen partial pressure even higher than at sea level. This method is intended to increase training intensity. == Principles and mechanisms == Altitude training works because of the difference in atmospheric pressure between sea level and high altitude. At sea level, air is denser and there are more molecules of gas per litre of air. Regardless of altitude, air is composed of 21% oxygen and 78% nitrogen. As the altitude increases, the pressure exerted by these gases decreases. Therefore, there are fewer molecules per unit volume: this causes a decrease in partial pressures of gases in the body, which elicits a variety of physiological changes in the body that occur at high altitude. The physiological adaptation that is mainly responsible for the performance gains achieved from altitude training, is a subject of discussion among researchers. Some, including American researchers Ben Levine and Jim Stray-Gundersen, claim it is primarily the increased red blood cell volume. Others, including Australian researcher Chris Gore, and New Zealand researcher Will Hopkins, dispute this and instead claim the gains are primarily a result of other adaptions such as a switch to a more economic mode of oxygen utilization. ===Increased red blood cell volume=== Human red blood cells At high altitudes, there is a decrease in oxygen hemoglobin saturation. This hypoxic condition causes hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) to become stable and stimulates the production of erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone secreted by the kidneys, EPO stimulates red blood cell production from bone marrow in order to increase hemoglobin saturation and oxygen delivery. Some athletes demonstrate a strong red blood cell response to altitude while others see little or no gain in red cell mass with chronic exposure. It is uncertain how long this adaptation takes because various studies have found different conclusions based on the amount of time spent at high altitudes. While EPO occurs naturally in the body, it is also made synthetically to help treat patients suffering from kidney failure and to treat patients during chemotherapy. Over the past thirty years, EPO has become frequently abused by competitive athletes through blood doping and injections in order to gain advantages in endurance events. Abuse of EPO, however, increases RBC counts beyond normal levels (polycythemia) and increases the viscosity of blood, possibly leading to hypertension and increasing the likelihood of a blood clot, heart attack or stroke. The natural secretion of EPO by the human kidneys can be increased by altitude training, but the body has limits on the amount of natural EPO that it will secrete, thus avoiding the harmful side effects of the illegal doping procedures. ===Other mechanisms=== Other mechanisms have been proposed to explain the utility of altitude training. Not all studies show a statistically significant increase in red blood cells from altitude training. One study explained the success by increasing the intensity of the training (due to increased heart and respiration rate). This improved training resulted in effects that lasted more than 15 days after return to sea level. Another set of researchers claim that altitude training stimulates a more efficient use of oxygen by the muscles. This efficiency can arise from numerous other responses to altitude training, including angiogenesis, glucose transport, glycolysis, and pH regulation, each of which may partially explain improved endurance performance independent of a greater number of red blood cells. Furthermore, exercising at high altitude has been shown to cause muscular adjustments of selected gene transcripts, and improvement of mitochondrial properties in skeletal muscle. In a study comparing rats active at high altitude versus rats active at sea level, with two sedentary control groups, it was observed that muscle fiber types changed according to homeostatic challenges which led to an increased metabolic efficiency during the beta oxidative cycle and citric acid cycle, showing an increased utilization of ATP for aerobic performance. Due to the lower atmospheric pressure at high altitudes, the air pressure within the breathing system must be lower than it would be at low altitudes in order for inhalation to occur. Therefore, inhalation at high altitudes typically involves a relatively greater lowering of the thoracic diaphragm than at low altitudes. ==See also== *Effects of high altitude on humans ==References== Category:Exercise physiology Category:Sports medicine ","title":"Altitude training"},{"id":"1269631","text":"Fulvestrant, sold under the brand name Faslodex among others, is a medication used to treat hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression as well as HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer in combination with palbociclib in women with disease progression after endocrine therapy. It is given by injection into a muscle. Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) and was first-in-class to be approved. It works by binding to the estrogen receptor and destabilizing it, causing the cell's normal protein degradation processes to destroy it. Fulvestrant was approved for medical use in the United States in 2002. ==Medical uses== ===Breast cancer=== Fulvestrant is used for the treatment of hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer or locally advanced unresectable disease in postmenopausal women; it is given by injection. A 2017 Cochrane review found it is as safe and effective as first line or second line endocrine therapy. It is also used to treat HR- positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with palbociclib in women with disease progression after first-line endocrine therapy. Due to the medication's having a chemical structure similar to that of estrogen, it can interact with immunoassays for blood estradiol concentrations and show falsely elevated results. This can improperly lead to discontinuing the treatment. ===Early puberty=== Fulvestrant has been used in the treatment of peripheral precocious puberty in girls with McCune‚ÄìAlbright syndrome. ==Contraindications== Fulvestrant should not be used in women with kidney failure or who are pregnant. ==Side effects== Very common (occurring in more than 10% of people) adverse effects include nausea, injection site reactions, weakness, and elevated transaminases. Common (between 1% and 10%) adverse effects include urinary tract infections, hypersensitivity reactions, loss of appetite, headache, blood clots in veins, hot flushes, vomiting, diarrhea, elevated bilirubin, rashes, and back pain. In a large clinical trial, the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with fulvestrant was 0.9%. ==Pharmacology== ===Pharmacodynamics=== Fulvestrant is an antiestrogen which acts as an antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER) and additionally as a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD). It works by binding to the estrogen receptor and making it more hydrophobic, which makes the receptor unstable and misfold, which in turn leads normal processes inside the cell to degrade it. In addition to its antiestrogenic activity, fulvestrant is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), albeit with relatively low affinity (10‚Äì100 nM, relative to 3‚Äì6 nM for estradiol). ===Pharmacokinetics=== Fulvestrant is slowly absorbed and maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached after about 5 days and the terminal half- life is around 50 days. Fulvestrant is highly (99%) bound to plasma proteins including very low density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and high density lipoprotein. It appears to be metabolized along the same pathways as endogenous steroids; CYP3A4 may be involved, but non-cytochrome routes appear to be more important. It does not inhibit any CYP450 enzymes. Elimination is almost all via feces. Fulvestrant does not cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier in animals and may not in humans as well. Accordingly, no effects of fulvestrant on brain function have been observed in preclinical or clinical research. ==Chemistry== Fulvestrant is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol. An alkyl-sulfinyl moiety was added to the endogenous estrogen receptor ligand. It was discovered through rational drug design, but was selected for further development via phenotypic screening. ==History== Fulvestrant was the first selective estrogen receptor degrader to be approved. It was approved in the United States in 2002 and in Europe in 2004. ==Society and culture== ===NICE evaluation=== The U.K. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) said in 2011 that it found no evidence Faslodex was significantly better than existing treatments, so its widespread use would not be a good use of resources for the country's National Health Service. The first month's treatment of Faslodex, which starts with a loading dose, costs ¬£1,044.82 ($1,666), and subsequent treatments cost ¬£522.41 a month. In the 12 months ending June 2015, the UK price (excluding VAT) of a month's supply of anastrozole (Arimidex), which is off patent, cost 89 pence/day, and letrozole (Femara) cost ¬£1.40/day.UK Department of Health Commercial Medicines Unit Electronic Medicines Information Tool, London, 2015UK‚Äôs NICE says no to AstraZeneca breast cancer drug Faslodex, The Pharma Letter, 10 November 2011National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence Guidance Breast cancer (metastatic) - fulvestrant ===Patent extension=== The original patent for Faslodex expired in October 2004.

Because fulvestrant cannot be given orally, efforts have been made to develop SERD drugs that can be taken by mouth, including brilanestrant and elacestrant. The clinical success of fulvestrant also led to efforts to discover and develop a parallel drug class of selective androgen receptor degraders (SARDs). == References == == External links == * Category:Antiestrogens Category:AstraZeneca brands Category:Estranes Category:GPER agonists Category:Hormonal antineoplastic drugs Category:Organofluorides Category:Peripherally selective drugs Category:Selective estrogen receptor degraders Category:World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited substances ","title":"Fulvestrant"},{"id":"1269655","text":"The Sender Feldberg/Black Forest (transmitter Black Forest) is a transmission facility for FM and TV in Feldberg, Black Forest, Germany.

An impersonator is someone who imitates or copies the behavior or actions of another. There are many reasons for impersonating someone: *Entertainment: An entertainer impersonates a celebrity, generally for entertainment, and makes fun of their personal lives, recent scandals and known behavior patterns. Especially popular objects of impersonation are Elvis Presley (see Elvis impersonator), Michael Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, and Lenin. Entertainers who impersonate multiple celebrities as part of their act, can be sorted into impressionists and celebrity impersonators. *Crime: As part of a criminal act such as identity theft. This is usually where the criminal is trying to assume the identity of another, in order to commit fraud, such as accessing confidential information, or to gain property not belonging to them. Also known as social engineering and impostors. *Decoys, used as a form of protection for political and military figures. This involves an impersonator who is employed (or forced) to perform during public appearances, to mislead observers. *Sowing discord, causing people to fight, or dislike each other for social, business or political gain. *Companionship: a rental family service provides actors portraying friends or family for platonic purposes. ==Celebrity impersonators== Thriller at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival with performers from Step It Up and Dance. A Madonna wannabe, an impersonator of Madonna's 1980s looks and fashion style. Celebrity impersonators are entertainers who look similar to celebrities and dress in such a way as to imitate them. Impersonators are known as look-alikes, impressionists, imitators tribute artists and wannabees. The interest may have originated with the need or desire to see a celebrity who has died. One of the most prominent examples of this phenomenon is the case of Elvis Presley. There are claimed to be more Elvis impersonators and tribute artists in the world than for any other celebrity. Edward Moss has appeared in movies and sitcoms, impersonating Michael Jackson. Tom Jones has attracted his share of impersonators from different places around the world.

It is a purely statistical concept, not defined by any municipal or county boundaries. Larger urban areas synonymous with cities or towns ( for both terms) for statistical purposes have a minimum of 10,000 inhabitants.. The same statistical definition is also used for urban areas in the other Nordic countries. In 2018, there were nearly two thousand urban areas in Sweden, which were inhabited by 87% of the Swedish population. Urban area is a common English translation of the Swedish term . The official term in English used by Statistics Sweden is, however, \\"locality\\" (). It could be compared with \\"census-designated places\\" in the United States. ==History== Until the beginning of the 20th century, only the towns/cities were regarded as urban areas. The built-up area and the municipal entity were normally almost congruent. Urbanization and industrialization created, however, many new settlements without formal city status. New suburbs grew up just outside city limits, being de facto urban but de jure rural. This created a statistical problem. The census of 1910 introduced the concept of \\"densely populated localities in the countryside\\". The term t√§tort (literally \\"dense place\\") was introduced in 1930. The municipal amalgamations placed more and more rural areas within city municipalities, which was the other side of the same problem. The administrative boundaries were in fact not suitable for defining rural and urban populations. From 1950 rural and urban areas had to be separated even within city limits, as, e.g., the huge wilderness around Kiruna had been declared a \\"city\\" in 1948. From 1965 only \\"non-administrative localities\\" are counted, independently of municipal and county borders. In 1971 \\"city\\" was abolished as a type of municipality. ==Terminology== Map of Sweden showing all urban areas (cities and towns) with a population of more than 20,000 (Mora is not correct; Varberg and Falkenberg missing). Urban areas in the meaning of t√§tort are defined independently on the division into counties and municipalities, and are defined solely according to population density. In practice, most references in Sweden are to municipalities, not specifically to towns or cities, which complicates international comparisons. Most municipalities contain many localities (up to 26 in Kristianstad Municipality), but some localities are, on the other hand, multimunicipal. Stockholm urban area is spread over 11 municipalities. When comparing the population of different cities, the urban area (t√§tort) population is to prefer ahead of the population of the municipality. The population of, e.g., Stockholm should be accounted as about 1.2 million rather than the approximately 800,000 of the municipality, and Lund rather about 75,000 than about 110,000. ==Swedish definitions== ===Terms used for statistical purposes=== * () is the central concept used in statistics. The definition is agreed upon in the Nordic countries: An urban area is any village, town or city with a population of at least 200, for which the contiguous built-up area meet the criterion that houses are not more than 200 meters apart when discounting rivers, parks, roads, etc. ‚Äì without regard to the ward, municipal or county boundaries. Delimitation of localities are made by Statistics Sweden every three years starting 2015 on a trial basis, previously they were made every five years. * () is a rural locality with 50‚Äì199 inhabitants in a contiguous built-up area with no more than 150 meters between houses. The concept is rarely used outside the field of statistics, where it is used for settlements just below the limit defined for . * Centralort () is mostly used in the meaning municipal seat or municipal center of service, commerce and administration for an area. ===Popular and traditional terms=== * Storstad () is a term usually reserved for Sweden's three largest cities: Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm√∂. Statistics Sweden uses the term metropolitan area () for these three cities and their immediate surroundings and municipalities.Statistics Sweden. Population in the metropolitan areas on Dec. 31, 2002 and 2003, SCB Befolkningsstatistik del 1-2, 2003. Retrieved 2 December 2007. * Stad () is the term avoided by Statistics Sweden, however, it roughly corresponds to urban areas with a population greater than 10,000. Judicially, the term stad has been obsolete since 1971, and is now mostly used describing localities which used to be chartered towns. The statistical category \\"large town\\" used by Statistics Sweden include municipalities with more than 90,000 inhabitants within a 30 km radius from the municipality centre.Statistics Sweden.Press release , Household budget survey (HBS), 2006-06-01 Nr 2006:079A. Retrieved 2 December 2007. There is also a category medelstor stad \\"middle large town\\". * K√∂ping () was also abolished as an official term in 1971 in governmental and statistical contexts, and is only rarely kept in use by laymen, although it has survived as part of the names of several smaller towns. The meaning was a locality with an intermediary legal status below that of a town. * Municipalsamh√§lle () was a term in use between 1875 and 1971, but it is no longer used outside of historical contexts. In 1863, Sweden was divided into 2,500 municipalities, whereof 89 were towns, 8 were market towns (k√∂pingar) and the rest rural municipalities (\\"landskommuner\\"). A \\"municipalsamh√§lle\\" was an administrative centre for one or several rural municipalities, with special regulations and privileges in common with towns. The term became obsolete in 1971 when the different types of municipalities were abandoned and a standard form for all municipalities was introduced. * Samh√§lle () is a common concept used by for urban areas that are intermediary in size between a town and a village. The term \\"samh√§lle\\" is also used in Swedish to denote \\"society\\", \\"community\\" or \\"state\\". (Compare: Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft.) A samh√§lle does not necessarily meet the criteria for the current t√§tort - or even sm√•ort concept. * By () is a traditional term but may in colloquial use refer to a suburb or town of considerable size. If at all used in the context of statistics, it must be assumed that the size of a by is smaller than that of a sm√•ort. (NB! Not to be confused with the same word in Danish and Norwegian, where it means town, while a village is called landsby.) ===Seasonal areas and suburbs=== * Fritidshusomr√•de () is in statistical context an area with less than 50 permanent inhabitants but at least 50 houses (in practice: weekend cottages/summer houses) meeting the criterion that they are not more than 150 metres apart. About a third of Sweden's \\"second homes\\" are located in such areas. The term belongs also to everyday usage, although less strictly defined. * F√∂rstad and f√∂rort () are much used terms with a somewhat negative connotation. ==Statistics== Before 2015 delimitation of localities were made by Statistics Sweden every five years, since then it is trialling a three-year update period. The number of urban areas in Sweden increased by 56 to 1,956 in 2010. A total of 8,016,000 ‚Äì 85 per cent ‚Äì of the Swedish population lived in an urban area; occupying only 1,3 per cent of Sweden's total land area, and the most populous urban area is Stockholm at 1,4 million people. ==See also== *Urban areas in the Nordic countries **List of urban areas in the Nordic countries *List of cities in Sweden *List of metropolitan areas in Sweden *List of municipalities of Sweden *List of urban areas in Sweden *Largest urban areas of the European Union *Geography of Sweden ==References== ==External links== *Statistics Sweden (Swedish) Category:Types of country subdivisions Category:Demographics of Sweden ","title":"Urban areas in Sweden"},{"id":"1269664","text":"Laurenz Meyer thumb Laurenz Meyer (* February 15, 1948, in Salzkotten, North Rhine-Westphalia) is a German politician (Christian Democratic Union or CDU). From 2000 to 2004 he was General Secretary of the CDU. ==Education and career== After his Abitur (school leaving) examinations in 1968 Meyer completed a course of study in economics at the University of M√ºnster, leaving in 1975 as a qualified economist. He was then employed at Vereinigte Elektrizit√§tswerke Westfalen, or VEW AG (which was later taken over by the RWE group) in Dortmund. He was most recently employed here as RWE's commercial director in the Arnsberg regional office. ==Family== Laurenz Meyer is married and has four daughters. He is separated from his wife and lives with his partner in Hamm. ==Party== Meyer has been a member of the CDU since 1968. From 1997 to 2001 he was State Treasurer of the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia. Meyer has belonged to the Federal Executive of the CDU since April 2000 and was General Secretary of the CDU from November 20, 2000 to December 22, 2004. ==Elected representative== Meyer was on the Hamm city council from 1975 to 1995 and was CDU leader on the council from 1989 to 1995. In 1994 he campaigned for the office of Lord Mayor, but lost to J√ºrgen Wieland, the candidate of the SPD (Social Democratic Party). From 1990 until 2003 Meyer was a member of the state parliament (Landtag) of North Rhine-Westphalia. Here he was party spokesperson for economic issues from 1990 to 1999, deputy leader from 1997 to 1999 and leader of the CDU in the state parliament from February 23, 1999, to June 2, 2000. After losing the 2000 election Meyer had to give up his office as party leader to J√ºrgen R√ºttgers. From June 6 to December 6, 2000 Meyer was then deputy speaker of the state parliament of North Rhine- Westphalia. Since 2002 Laurenz Meyer has been a member of the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag). He entered parliament by being on the CDU's party list for North Rhine-Westphalia, in Germany's proportional representation electoral system. ==RWE Affair and Resignation== On December 10, 2004 it was reported that Meyer (nicknamed Laurenz Nimmersatt, \\"Gluttonous Laurenz\\") was receiving power from RWE (which had taken over his former employer VEW in 2000) at a discounted employee rate, although he had parted company with the group in 1999. One week later new allegations surfaced, according to which he was receiving payments from RWE even while he was General Secretary of the CDU. Meyer described these as \\"special dividends\\". In addition Meyer was still receiving earnings as deputy speaker in the North Rhine-Westphalian state parliament and was thus receiving three salaries. The \\"Bild am Sonntag\\" newspaper reported on December 19 that CDU boss Angela Merkel had stripped her General Secretary of his powers. Close party colleagues demanded his resignation. On December 20 Meyer announced that he would donate the amount in question (81,800 euros) to the charity SOS Children's Villages. After pressure from the party's rank and file Laurenz Meyer resigned as General Secretary on December 22, 2004. The reason for his resignation was that contrary to his description the special payment was not a severance pay since Meyer returned to the company only after the CDU defeat at the North Rhine-Westphalian election in May 2000. This fact and the false information he provided to Angela Merkel made him untenable for the party. The received payments admitted by him and the announcement of a donation to SOS-Kinderd√∂rfer were especially unable to pacify the party's branches in North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig- Holstein, which were involved with their area's election campaigns. As a Member of Parliament, Meyer continued to receive the usual salary of 7,009 euros a month (7,960 ‚Ç¨ as of 2012, 8,252 ‚Ç¨ as of 2013), plus the tax-free monthly expense allowance of 3,551 euros (4.123 ‚Ç¨ in 2013). Furthermore, he may reactivate his employment contract with the RWE energy company, from which he last drew an annual income of 112,381 euros. On December 23, 2004 RWE announced the result of an internal investigation into the payments made to Meyer. It found that 160,000 of 250,000 DM were unjustified and had been made by VEW as a result of a \\"communication error\\". In a statement on December 17 Meyer had described this payment as \\"legally correct\\", but also admitted \\"...I have nevertheless become aware of the fact that many people have a problem understanding that at that time I accepted this money, since I went back into the company...\\". ==References== This article draws heavily on the corresponding article in the German-language Wikipedia. ==External links== * \\"German Opposition Deputy Resigns\\", in English * Laurenz Meyer's Website, in German * Biography at the website of the German Bundestag, in German Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:People from Salzkotten Category:Christian Democratic Union of Germany politicians Category:Members of the Bundestag for North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Members of the Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia Category:21st-century German politicians Category:Members of the Bundestag 2005‚Äì2009 Category:Members of the Bundestag 2002‚Äì2005 Category:Members of the Bundestag for the Christian Democratic Union of Germany ","title":"Laurenz Meyer"},{"id":"1269672","text":"Sharaf al-Din Ali Yazdi, Timur besieges the Georgian Castle of Gorin Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi or Sharif al-Din Ali‚Äô Yazdi () (born Yazd, Iran‚Äîdied 1454, Yazd), also known by his pen name Sharaf, was a 15th-century Persian scholar who authored several works in the arts and sciences, including mathematics, astronomy, enigma, literature such as poetry, and history, the Zafarnama, a life of Timur, being his most famous(539).

Doyle ranked \\"The Adventure of the Second Stain\\" eighth in his list of his twelve favourite Holmes stories. ==Synopsis== The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for European Affairs consult Holmes on a matter of utmost delicacy. Lord Bellinger, the Prime Minister, and the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope, the Secretary of State for European Affairs, come to Holmes in the matter of a document stolen from Hope's dispatch box, which he kept at home in Whitehall Terrace when not at work. If divulged, this document could bring about very dire consequences for all Europe, even war. They are loath to tell Holmes at first the exact nature of the document's contents, but when Holmes declines to take on their case, they tell him that it was a rather injudicious letter from a foreign potentate. It disappeared from the dispatch box one evening when Hope's wife was out at the theatre for four hours. No one in the house knew about the document, not even the Secretary's wife. None of the servants could have guessed what was in the box. Holmes decides to begin with some spies known to him, and is then astonished to hear from Dr. Watson that one of those that he names, Eduardo Lucas, has been murdered. Before Holmes has a chance to act, Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope, the European Secretary's wife, arrives unexpectedly at 221B Baker Street. She asks Holmes insistently about the stolen document's contents, but Holmes only reveals to her that there would be very unfortunate consequences if the document were not found. Lady Hilda also begs Holmes to tell her husband nothing of her visit. Holmes's spy hunt does not go well. Four days after the murder, French police arrest the probable culprit of it, a woman whom Lucas has married in Paris under an alias. She was seen in London near Lucas's house the night of the crime, but she is now useless as a witness because she has gone insane. Inspector Lestrade calls Holmes to the murder scene to examine something odd. Lucas bled over a drugget, and the blood soaked through it, but curiously there is no bloodstain on the floor under the drugget. However, there is one under the opposite edge of the carpet. It can only mean that the constable guarding the crime scene has been foolish enough to let someone in, and leave them alone while they moved things in the room including the carpet. Holmes tells Lestrade to take the constable to a back room and obtain a confession, which he does vigorously. Meanwhile, Holmes pulls the unfastened carpet aside and quickly finds a hiding place in the floor, but it is empty. The errant constable tells Holmes that the unauthorized visitor was a young woman. She apparently fainted at the sight of the blood, but had left while the constable went out to fetch some brandy to revive her. As Holmes is leaving Lucas's house, he shows the constable a photograph and he recognizes it as the visitor. The second stain allowed Holmes to infer that the parquet floor concealed a secret hiding place. Holmes goes to the Hope household and confronts Lady Hilda, accusing her of the theft. At first she denies everything, but is forced to admit her wrongdoing under threat of certain scandal. Lady Hilda admits that Lucas was blackmailing her with a compromising letter written by her years earlier, and demanded the contents of her husband's dispatch box for the return thereof (an unnamed spy within her husband's own office had made Lucas aware of the document). Lady Hilda went to Lucas's house to do the business when, as it happened, his wife from Paris showed up and confronted him about his affair, believing that Lady Hilda was his mistress. Lady Hilda hurriedly left. She returned, however, to fetch the stolen document after her visit to Holmes convinced her that she needed to do so. She hands the document to Holmes. At Holmes's suggestion, the document is put back in the dispatch box using Lady Hilda's duplicate key. When Hope arrives back home with the Prime Minister, Holmes pretends to believe that the evidence has convinced him that the document must still be in the box. It is soon found, and Hope rejoices that it was only a mistake. In this way, the lost document is restored without Lady Hilda's part in the affair being revealed‚Äîthough at the possible price of making her husband look a bit stupid. The Prime Minister, however, is no fool. He can see that there is an underlying story, but Holmes simply responds, \\"We also have our diplomatic secrets.\\" ==Background== This case was first mentioned in \\"The Adventure of the Naval Treaty\\". In \\"The Naval Treaty\\", Watson says that this case has \\"interest of such importance and implicates so many of the first families in the kingdom that for many years it will be impossible to make it public.\\" On the other hand, Watson also refers there to \\"Monsieur Dubuque of the Paris police, and Fritz von Waldbaum, the well-known specialist of Dantzig, both of whom had wasted their energies upon what proved to be side- issues\\" who do not appear in the published version of the story. In My Dear Holmes, a biography of Holmes by Gavin Brend, Brend hypothesises that their mention suggests there could be a second adventure featuring a \\"second stain\\". Some scholars have speculated that the \\"foreign potentate\\" who wrote the missing letter was Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, whose foreign policy was controversial in Britain. A reference in this same story makes it clear that \\"The Adventure of the Second Stain\\" is set in July 1888, in the middle of summer, whereas Watson says in the published version of \\"The Second Stain\\" that the case happened in autumn. Watson states that, due to Holmes's retirement, the detective has been trying to avoid publicity, and only allowed Watson to publish the story because the doctor had \\"promised\\" to in \\"The Adventure of the Naval Treaty.\\" A spy called Oberstein appears both in this story and in \\"The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\\" (again listed as one of the three most prominent agents in London), set seven years later. ==Publication history== \\"The Adventure of the Second Stain\\" was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in December 1904, and in the US in Collier's on 28 January 1905.Smith (2014), p. 148. The story was published with eight illustrations by Sidney Paget in the Strand, and with six illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in Collier's.Cawthorne (2011), p. 135. It was included in the short story collection The Return of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the US in February 1905 and in the UK in March 1905.Cawthorne (2011), p. 110. ==Adaptations== ===Film and television=== A short silent film adapted from the story was released in 1922 as part of the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Watson, and featuring Dorothy Fane as Lady Hope and Wallace Bosco as Eduardo Lucas. Teddy Arundell played Inspector Hopkins in this short film and other films in the series. The story was adapted for a 1951 TV episode of Sherlock Holmes, starring Alan Wheatley as Holmes. The story was adapted for the 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing. The episode is now lost. The story was adapted in the Granada Television series The Return of Sherlock Holmes, starring Jeremy Brett, in 1986. The story was also adapted in the Soviet TV film The Twentieth Century Approaches (1986), the last television film in the series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. An episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century was based on the story. The episode, titled \\"The Adventure of the Second Stain\\", aired in 2001. ===Radio=== A radio adaptation aired as an episode of the American radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode was adapted by Edith Meiser and aired on 23 June 1932, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 43. Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, that aired on 29 January 1940.Dickerson (2019), p. 89. Another episode in the same series adapted from the story aired on 4 January 1942.Dickerson (2019), p. 104. John Gielgud played Holmes and Ralph Richardson played Watson in a radio adaptation of the story that aired on the BBC Light Programme in November 1954. It also featured Raf De La Torre as Lord Bellinger and John Cazabon as Lestrade. The production aired in January 1955 on NBC radio.Dickerson (2019), p. 285. Michael Hardwick dramatised the story as a radio adaptation for the BBC Home Service, as part of the 1952‚Äì1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson, with Simon Lack as Trelawney Hope and Barbara Mitchell as Mrs Hudson. The adaptation aired in 1967. \\"The Second Stain\\" was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1993 by Bert Coules as part of the 1989‚Äì1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Jeremy Clyde as Trelawney Hope and Sabina Franklyn as Lady Hilda. The story was adapted as a 2013 episode of The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a series on the American radio show Imagination Theatre, starring John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * * * ==External links== * * Second Stain, The Adventure of the Category:1904 short stories Category:Short stories adapted into films Category:Fiction set in 1888 Category:Works originally published in The Strand Magazine ","title":"The Adventure of the Second Stain"},{"id":"1269692","text":"Jakub Sobieski (May 5, 1590 - June 23, 1646) was a Polish noble, parliamentarian, diarist, political activist, military leader and father of King John III Sobieski. He was the son of castellan and voivode Marek Sobieski and Jadwiga Snopkowska. == Biography == Jakub Sobieski Sobieski was educated in Krak√≥w and Paris. He was a famed orator and parliamentarian. He participated in the military expedition (Dymitriads) against Russia in 1617-1618 (wounded during the assault of Moscow), and was a member of the War Council (Rada wojenna) of King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV. He took part in negotiations with Muscovy in the Truce of Deulino in 1618. Subsequently, he fought in the Chocim expedition against the Ottoman Empire in 1621, and the expedition against Abazy Pasa in 1633. He was one of the negotiations with Sweden in the Treaty of Stuhmsdorf (Sztumska Wie≈õ) in 1635. After his marriage to Zofia Teofillia Dani≈Çowicz his wealth increased significantly, as Zofia brought in her inheritance after the ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski family and part of the Dani≈Çowski family estates, including ≈ª√≥≈Çkiew Castle. ===Official career === He was courtier since 1617, Krajczy of the Crown since 1626, Podczaszy of the Crown since 1636, voivode of Belz Voivodeship since 1638 and of Ruthenian Voivodeship since 1641 and castellan of Krak√≥w since 1646. Starost of Trembowla, Krasnystaw, Jawor√≥w, Stryj, Ka≈Çusz, Bar and Gniewo. Elected Deputy to seven Sejms between 1623 and 1632, as Sejm Marshal he led the ordinary Sejm in Warsaw on January 24 - March 5, 1623 and on January 27 - March 10, 1626, the extraordinary Sejm in Warsaw on June 27 - July 18, 1628 and the Election Sejm in Warsaw on September 24 - November 15, 1632. == Character == He was considered by his contemporaries a wise and honorable person. Member of many commissions and diplomatic bodies, he often acted as a mediator or as a guardian of orphaned children. In politics, he usually supported king's plans, but was also a defender of the nobility rights and religious tolerance. ==Children== * Marek became starost. * John became Marshal, Hetman and King of Poland. * Katarzyna married W≈Çadys≈Çaw Dominik Zas≈Çawski and Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. * Anna Rozalia became a Benedictine nun in Lw√≥w. ==Works== Commentariorum chotinensis belli libri tres During the Chocim expedition in 1621 he wrote a diary called Commentariorum chotinensis belli libri tres (Pamiƒôtnik wojny chocimskiej - Diary of the Chocim War), which was published in 1646 in Danzig. It was used by Wac≈Çaw Potocki as a basis for his epic poem, Transakcja wojny chocimskiej (The Progress of the War of Chocim). He authored Commentariorum Chotinensis belli libri tres (1646) and instructions for his sons journeying to Krak√≥w (1640) and France (1645) which are seen as a prime example of liberal education of that era. ==See also== *Zolochiv Castle ==External links== * Jakub Sobieski, entry from PSB * Jakub Sobieski, the King's Father at the Wilan√≥w Palace Museum ==References== Category:Secular senators of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth Category:1590 births Category:1646 deaths Jakub Category:Castellans of Krak√≥w Category:Polish people of the Polish‚ÄìMuscovite War (1605‚Äì1618) Category:17th-century Polish people ","title":"Jakub Sobieski"},{"id":"1269693","text":"DBI may refer to: *dBi, decibel isotropic *DBI (gene), the gene encoding diazepam binding inhibitor in humans *DBI Beverage, a subsidiary of Ingram Entertainment *DBI, a company founded by David Belt which now operates as DBI Projects and DBI Construction Consultants *Beck Depression Inventory, a psychological test used to measure depression levels *Dahabshil Bank International, Somalia *Data Bus Inversion - a method of power saving in DDR4 *Davies‚ÄìBouldin index, a metric for evaluating clustering algorithms *Davie- Brown Index, an independent index for brand marketers *Delaware Biotechnology Institute, University of Delaware, U.S. *Doppelg√§nger brand image, Doublewalker in marketing *Dubai, a city in the United Arab Emirates *Dynamic binary instrumentation, a technique to change programs *ISO 639:dbi or Doka, a Plateau language of Nigeria *Perl DBI, a database interface for Perl *Phenformin, by the trade name DBI ","title":"DBI"},{"id":"1269698","text":"Goldbergturm The Goldbergturm is a 51 metre high water tower on the Goldberg (gold mountain) at in Sindelfingen, Germany.

The most obvious presentation of ocular (eye) injuries is redness and pain of the affected eyes. This is not, however, universally true, as tiny metallic projectiles may cause neither symptom. Tiny metallic projectiles should be suspected when a patient reports metal on metal contact, such as with hammering a metal surface. Corneal foreign body is one of the most common preventable occupational hazard.Onkar A. Commentary: Tackling the corneal foreign body. Indian J Ophthalmol 2020;68:57-8. Intraocular foreign bodies do not cause pain because of the lack of nerve endings in the vitreous humour and retina that can transmit pain sensations. As such, general or emergency department doctors should refer cases involving the posterior segment of the eye or intraocular foreign bodies to an ophthalmologist. Ideally, ointment would not be used when referring to an ophthalmologist, since it diminishes the ability to carry out a thorough eye examination. Flicking sand, flying pieces of wood, metal, glass and stone are notorious for causing much of the eye trauma. Sporting balls such as cricket ball, lawn tennis ball, squash ball, shuttlecock, and other high speed flying objects can strike the eye. The eye is also susceptible to blunt trauma in a fistfight. Children‚Äôs games such as bow-and-arrows, bb guns and firecrackers can lead to eye trauma. Road traffic accidents (RTAs) with head and facial trauma may also have an eye injury - these are usually severe in nature with multiple lacerations, shards of glasses embedded in tissues, orbital fractures, severe hematoma and penetrating open-globe injuries with prolapse of eye contents. Other causes of intraocular trauma may arise from workplace tools or even common household implements, including bottle-caps suddenly propelling at great force. About 5.3 million cases of foreign bodies in the eyes occurred in 2013. ==Presentation== ===Complications=== Multiple complications are known to occur following eye injury: corneal scarring, hyphema, iridodialysis, post-traumatic glaucoma, uveitis cataract, vitreous hemorrhage and retinal detachment. The complications risk is high with retinal tears, penetrating injuries and severe blunt trauma. ==Diagnosis== The goal of investigation is the assessment of the severity of the ocular injury with an eye to implementing a management plan as soon as is required. The usual eye examination should be attempted, and may require a topical anesthetic in order to be tolerable. Many topical agents cause burning upon instillation. Proxymetacaine has been found to have the best tolerance. Depending on the medical history and preliminary examination, the primary care physician should designate the eye injury as a true emergency, urgent or semi-urgent. ===Classification === Eye injury by impact of small plastic body Based on the injury to the eyewall (outer fibrous coat of the eye consisting of cornea and sclera) *Closed globe injury: the eye globe is intact, but the seven rings of the eye have been classically described as affected by blunt trauma. Types include contusion and lamellar laceration * Open globe injury: there is a full thickness injury of the eye wall (cornea and sclera) It includes A) Globe rupture: caused by blunt trauma and is an inside-out injury. B) Globe laceration: a full-thickness wound caused by sharp objects. It includes 1)Penetrating trauma: the globe integrity is disrupted by a full-thickness entry wound and may be associated with prolapse of the internal contents of the eye. Such injuries are often referred to as a Globe fracture or a Globe rupture, although these can be incurred by blunt trauma as well. 2) Perforating trauma: the globe integrity is disrupted in two places due to an entrance and exit wound (through and through injury). This is a quite severe type of eye injury. Other types include * Blowout fracture of the orbit is caused by blunt trauma, classically described for fist or ball injury, leading to fracture of the floor or medial wall of the orbit due to sudden increased pressure on the orbital contents. * Muscular Entrapment Fracture of the orbital bones can lead to muscular entrapment limiting gaze in one direction. ===Emergency=== An emergency must be treated within minutes. This includes chemical burns of both the conjunctiva and cornea. ===Urgent=== An urgent case must be treated within hours. This includes penetrating globe injuries; corneal abrasions or corneal foreign bodies; hyphema (must be referred); eyelid lacerations that are deep, involve the lid margin or involve the lacrimal canaliculi; radiant energy burns such as arc eye (welder's burn) or snow blindness; or, rarely, traumatic optic neuropathy. ===Semi-urgent=== Semi-urgent cases must be managed within 1‚Äì2 days. They include orbital fractures and subconjunctival hemorrhages. ==Management== ===Irrigation=== The first line of management for chemical injuries is usually copious irrigation of the eye with an isotonic saline or sterile water. In the cases of chemical burns, one should not try to buffer the solution, but instead dilute it with copious flushing. ===Patching=== Depending on the type of ocular injury, either a pressure patch or shield patch should be applied. Up until circa 1987, pressure patches were the preferred method of treatment for corneal abrasions in non-contact lens wearers; Multiple controlled studies conducted by accredited organizations such as the American Academy of Ophthalmology have shown that pressure patching is of little or no value in healing corneal abrasions and is actually detrimental to healing in some cases. A Cochrane Review found that patching simple corneal abrasions may not improve healing or reduce pain. Pressure patching should never be used on an individual presenting with a corneal abrasion who has a history of contact lens wear. In this circumstance, a virulent infection caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is at a clearly delineated increased risk for occurrence. These infections can cause blindness within 24 ‚Äì 48 hours and there is a possibility that the infection can move into the peri-orbital socket, resulting in the need for evisceration of the eyeball. In rare cases, the infection can enter the brain and cause death to the patient. In cases of globe penetration, pressure patches should never be applied, and instead a shield patch should be applied that protects the eye without applying any pressure. If a shield patch is applied to one eye, the other eye should also be patched due to eye movement. If the uninjured eye moves, the injured eye will also move involuntarily possibly causing more damage. ===Suturing=== In cases of eyelid laceration, sutures may be a part of appropriate management by the primary care physician so long as the laceration does not threaten the canaliculi, is not deep, and does not affect the lid margins. ==Recovery== Eating certain products and using special routines may help recovery. ==Epidemiology== A recent study estimated that from 2002‚Äì2003 there were 27,152 injuries in the United States related to the wearing of eyeglasses. The same study concluded that sports-related injuries due to eyeglasses wear were more common in those under the age of 18 and that fall-related injuries due to wearing eyeglasses were more common in those aged 65 and over. Although eyeglasses-related injuries do occur, prescription eyeglasses and non-prescription sunglasses have been found to \\"offer measurable protection which results in a lower incidence of severe eye injuries to those wearing [them]\\". ==See also== * Black eye * Chemical eye injury * United States Eye Injury Registry * Wilderness medical emergencies ==References== Category:Eye injury ","title":"Eye injury"},{"id":"1269715","text":"Hyp or HYP may refer to: HYP Technologies.

Heoroweard is a character who appears in Beowulf and also in Norse legends, where he is named Hj√∂rvar√∞r or Hiartuar. If he existed in real life, his name would have been Proto-Norse *Heruwarduz. In the Norse sources, Hereoweard rebelled against Hro√∞ulf/Hr√≥lf Kraki and killed him, but otherwise the sources vary greatly. This is an account of the differences: In the paraphrase of Bjarkam√°l in the Gesta Danorum of Saxo Grammaticus, his army consisted of Swedes in one line and of Geats in another line. This information does not appear in any other sources. Several sources mention that he was married to Skuld, who according to Angrim's summary of the lost Skj√∂ldunga saga was the daughter of A√∞ils the Swedish king (called Eadgils in Beowulf). However, according to the Chronicon Lethrense and Hr√≥lf Kraki's saga, she was the daughter of Helgi (Halga), whereas Saxo is vague whether it was Adils or Helgi who was her father. Hr√≥lf Kraki's saga does not mention where he came from, but according to Arngr√≠mur J√≥nsson, Heoroweard was the king of √ñland and according to Saxo, he became Hr√≥lf's jarl in Sweden, whereas in the Chronicon Lethrense, he was German and the jarl of Sk√•ne. In Beowulf, he is the son of Heorogar, the elder brother of Halga (Helgi) and Hro√∞gar (Hr√≥ar). (Consequently, he had greater right to the Danish throne than Hr√≥lf Kraki (Hro√∞ulf), and it is not surprising that he was the one who slew Hr√≥lf.) He is mentioned only once, at lines 2160-2161. Beowulf, in the act of giving to his lord Hygelac the armor of Heorogar (which Hrothgar had given to Beowulf as a reward), repeats what Hrothgar told him: \\"No sooner would Heorogar give it to his son, valiant Heoroweard, though he was true to him...\\" He did not survive long after Hr√≥lfs death. According to Arngr√≠mur J√≥nsson's epitome of Skj√∂ldunga saga, Hr√≥lf Kraki's saga and the Chronicon Lethrense, he was killed shortly after. According to Hr√≥lf Kraki's saga, he was killed during the battle, and according to the other sources, he became king but was killed the same day. ==Succession== According to Arngr√≠mur, Hereoweard was succeeded by R√∂rek (called Hre√∞ric in Beowulf), the cousin of Hr√≥lf's father, but he was attacked by Valdar. They shared the kingdom so that R√∂rek kept Zealand, whereas Valdar took Sk√•ne. This version does not fit Bjarkimal as it relates that R√∂rik had been killed by Hr√≥lf. According to Hr√≥lf Kraki's saga, Skuld inherited the kingdom but was killed by the Geatish king Thorir Houndsfoot and by Yrsa's men. The kingdom then passed into the hands of Hr√≥lf's daughters. According to Saxo, it is H√∂√∞r, A√∞ils' brother who became the king of both Denmark and Sweden. In the Chronicon Lethrense, it is Haki, son of Hamund, who became the king of Denmark, but the other sources who mention him place him centuries earlier. ==Comments== The Danish scholar Axel Olrik (1903) has proposed a solution to why the sources vary. According to Beowulf, Adils gains the Swedish throne aided by the Geats. In Heoroweard's case, he is a pretender who gains the Danish throne aided by the Swedes. This is why Heoroweard is easily made jarl of Swedes, as in Saxo's patriotic tradition Swedish rulers are frequently appointed and dethroned. In order to make this possible, Saxo, or his tradition, had to make Adils defeated by the Danes and losing his kingdom. In Arngr√≠mur's Icelandic tradition, which had a more clear conception of the Swedish line of kings, Heoroweard could not be made ruler of Sweden, and so he was named as the ruler of a kingdom on the fringe of Sweden, √ñland, a kingdom which was known to be independent, but whose line of kings was no longer known. In Arngr√≠mur and the Chronicon Lethrense, Heoroweard is the son- in-law of Adils, married to his daughter Skuld, whereas Hr√≥lf Kraki's saga makes him the son-in-law of Helgi (according to Olrik, he could not be married to his own cousin). The account shows that Heoroweard had close connection with Adils and Olrik suggests that the real reason behind Hr√≥lfs voyage to Uppsala was Adils' support of Heoroweard. However, according to Snorri, Hr√≥lf died during the Swedish king √ñsten's reign. If both Snorri and Olrik are right, the Swedish king who supported Hereoweard when attacking and killing Hr√≥lf may not have been Adils, but √ñsten. See also Origins for Beowulf and Hr√≥lf Kraki for more on the historical background of these characters. ==References== Nerman, B. Det svenska rikets uppkomst. Stockholm, 1925.

They were used from 1955 to 1994 to carry a 220 kilovolt (150 kilovolt until 1971) power line across the Strait of Messina, between the Scilla substation in Calabria on the Italian mainland at and the Messina-Santo substation in Sicily at . ==Design== The two pylons, built in 1955, are both free-standing steel towers. Each stands on an cross-shaped base and is equipped with a crossbar that carries four conductors at a height of , and another V-shaped structure at the top which carries two additional conductors in addition to ground wires. In contrast to more conventional pylon design, the corners of the pylons are arranged diagonally along the direction of the course of the line. The pylons of Messina were the model for the Elbe Crossing 1 in Germany and were, until the completion of Elbe Crossing 2, the tallest pylons in the world. They did however have the longest span of any hydroelectric crossing ever built at 3646 metershttps://www.atlasobscura.com/places/pylons- messina#:~:text=Climb%20the%20dead%20electric%20pylons%20of%20Messina.&text;=The%20line%20has%20a%20span,Sicily%2C%20and%20one%20at%20Porticello., even greater than that of the current record holder the Zhoushan Island Overhead Powerline Tie at 2,700 meters. The span was able to be so large because there wasn't a need for a high clearance, the conductors weren't as heavy and because the east tower was built on elevated ground approximately 163 m (536 ft) asl, giving the tower a total elevation of 396 m (1,300 ft) above sea level. After their completion, the oscillation of the structures and their maximum deflections were determined in a very unusual manner: engineers mounted three rockets with a thrust of 9800 kilonewtons on top of the pylons and ignited them.Turmbauwerke, Bauverlag GmbH, Wiesbaden, 1966 The line had switching stations at each end of the span. At the Calabrian station, Cannitello, (), the conductors were fixed tightly to a strainer portal. At the Sicilian station at Torre Faro (), the conductors were strained by a device providing constant force, which was situated in a building with two inspiring towers. == Conductors == Until 1971, the electrical service consisted of a single 150 kV three-phase AC system. Four conductors, of which one was used as backup, were installed on the crossbar of the pylon. In 1971 the voltage was increased to 220 kV and two additional conductors were installed at the bottom site of the V-shaped pinnacles. This gave a total transmission capacity of 300 MW. Conductors consisting of steel and aluminium with a diameter of 27.8 mm were used. They had an aluminium cross section of 45 mm2 and a steel cross section of 305 mm2. The minimum height of the conductors over the Strait of Messina was 70 metres, to allow large ships to pass safely below. This, together with the span of , required a tension force of 608 N/mm2 in the conductor cables. Antivibration ropes were used to dampen oscillations. By the early 1980s, this transmission capacity was no longer sufficient. It could not be increased by using bundle conductors or more conductive cables, as bundle conductors tend to have much greater wind-induced oscillations than single conductors, which can result in short circuits in such a long span. Normal overhead lines use conducting cables with a larger aluminium portion but these do not have the tensile strength needed for this span. In 1985 a 380 kV three- phase AC submarine cable with a maximum transmission capacity of 1000 MW was laid underneath the Strait of Messina. The electrical crossing was decommissioned in 1993 and the conductors were removed a year later. ==Today== The former electricity pylon at Torre Faro has been open to visitors since 2006 After the removal of the power lines, the pylons remain with protected status as historical monuments and are used for meteorological measurements, high distance rescue training and telecommunications. Since 2006, it has been possible to visit the pylon on the Sicilian shore; access to the top is by a stairway with 1,250 steps. The switching stations at both ends of the span still exist. The former anchor portal at Cannitello Switching Station is still in place but the tensioning system at Torre Faro has been dismantled. The unused power line from Scilla substation to Cannitello remains, while the line from Torre Faro Switching Station to Messina-Santo substation may be completely dismantled. ==Messina Strait submarine cable== The submarine cable across the Strait of Messina was laid in 1985. It has a total transmission capacity of 1000 MW and is a part of the single-circuit 380 kV powerline between Rizziconi substation on the Calabrian mainland () and Sorgente substation on Sicily (). It starts at the end of the overhead line south of Villa San Giovanni (), enters the sea at , reaches Sicily in Messina () and ends north of Messina (), where the overhead line to Sorgente starts. The cable consists of 4 conductors, one of which serves as a reserve. ==Second 380 kV cable == Plans were announced in July 2010 to build a second 380 kV power line between Sorgente and Rizziconi in 2015.

It is often grouped together with second-generation cephalosporins and has a similar antibacterial spectrum, but with additional anti-anaerobe coverage. Cefotetan was developed by Yamanouchi. It is marketed outside Japan by AstraZeneca with the brand names Apatef and Cefotan. == Adverse effects == The chemical structure of cefotetan, like that of several other cephalosporins, contains an N-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT or 1-MTT) side chain. As the antibiotic is broken down in the body, it releases free NMTT, which can cause hypoprothrombinemia (likely due to inhibition of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase) and a reaction with ethanol similar to that produced by disulfiram (Antabuse), due to inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase. ==Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility== Cefotetan has a broad spectrum of activity and has been used to treat bacterial infections of the bone, skin, urinary tract, and lower respiratory tract.

He was prolific both in Moscow, Russia, and in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. ==Biography== Born in Moscow, Russia, Korndorf studied composition with Sergei Balasanyan at the Moscow Conservatory from 1965 to 1970. During these years, he wrote a one-act opera A tale on... () based on the work of Semyon Kirsanov. In 1973, Korndorf completed post-graduate studies with his opera Feast in the Time of Plague based on the play of the same name by Alexander Pushkin. He studied conducting with Leo Ginsburg from 1967 to 1979 and taught composition and orchestration at the Conservatory from 1972 to 1991. In 1973, he became a member of the Union of Composers and the Moscow Presidium of the Soviet Composers' Union. He was a co-founder and deputy president of the New Association for Contemporary Music (ACM). His early works were written in a traditional and academic manner until he adopted an atonal post-expressionist style. Later, he turned to a kind of minimalist repetitive aesthetic, notable in his Confessiones (1979) for double bass and twelve wind instruments, and in Jarilo (1981) an extensive piece for piano and tape. Korndorf developed this aesthetic further in his large-scale works such as the three Hymns (1987‚Äì1990), his 3rd and 4th Symphonies, and the opera MR (Marina and Rainer) based on correspondence between Marina Tsvetaeva and Rainer Maria Rilke. In 1991, Korndorf left Russia for Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he began experimenting with electro-acoustic media. In Canada, he became an associate composer of the Canadian Music Centre and an associate of the Canadian League of Composers. He taught composition at the University of British Columbia towards the end of his life. A champion of Korndorf's music, Russian conductor Alexander Lazarev has performed and recorded most of his work. Korndorf died suddenly while playing soccer with friends in 2001. He was 54. ==Selected works== *Concertino for viola and string orchestra (1970) *Sonata for viola solo (1970) *Feast in the Time of Plague ‚Äì one-act opera after Alexander Pushkin (1972) *Symphony 1 ‚Äì for full symphony orchestra (1975) *Confessiones ‚Äì for 14 players and tape (1979) *Symphony No. 2 ‚Äì for full symphony orchestra (1980) *Movements ‚Äì for percussion ensemble (1981) *Primitive music ‚Äì for twelve saxophones (1981) *Yarilo ‚Äì for piano and tape (1981) *Yes!! ‚Äì ritual for three singers, chamber ensemble and tape (1982) *Singing ‚Äì for mezzo-soprano and tape (1982) *Tristful Songs ‚Äì for chamber choir and percussion (1 player) (1983) *Con Sordino ‚Äì for 16 string instruments and harpsichord (1984) *Lullaby ‚Äì for two pianos (1984) *Brass-quintet for two trumpets, horn, trombone and tuba (1985) *Concerto capriccioso ‚Äì for violoncello solo, string orchestra and percussion (1986) *Amoroso ‚Äì for 11 players (1986) *The Dance in Metal in Honour of John Cage ‚Äì for one percussion player (1986) *In Honour of Alfred Schnittke (AGSCH) ‚Äì string trio for violin, viola and violoncello (1986) *Hymn I Sempre Tutti ‚Äì for full symphony orchestra (1987) *Hymn II ‚Äì for full symphony orchestra (1987) *MR (Marina and Rainer) ‚Äì chamber opera in one act after J.

She is one of the country's most widely recognized and awarded female country singers of the 1990s, winning the Canadian Country Music Association's Fans' Choice Award twice (1993 and 1995). In 2011, Wright was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame. Wright's primary success has been in her native Canada, where she has charted more than twenty-five singles, including six Number One hits: \\"Take It Like a Man\\", \\"One Time Around\\", \\"Guitar Talk\\", \\"One Good Man\\", \\"Nobody's Girl\\" and \\"Crank My Tractor\\". She also had chart success in the United States in the 1990s, landing in the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts with \\"Take It Like a Man\\" at No. 10, \\"He Would Be Sixteen\\" at No. 31 and \\"New Kind of Love\\" at No. 32\\\\. ==Career== ===Early life=== Michelle Wright was born on July 1, 1961 in Chatham, Ontario. Wright grew up in the small nearby town of Merlin where her parents were both local music performers. By 1980, when Wright was in college studying counseling for the mentally disadvantaged, she joined a local band with whom she performed until 1983. That year Wright started her own band. She performed with her own band until 1988. In 1985, while performing with her band, Wright signed a record deal with Savannah Records. The next year she released her debut single, \\"I Want to Count on You\\", which peaked at No. 48 on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart. Wright's debut album, Do Right by Me, was issued in 1988 and produced seven more singles, including Wright's cover of the 1974 Andy Kim hit, \\"Rock Me Gently\\", which reached No. 7 on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart. The album's success in Canada led to a record contract with Arista Nashville. Wright became one of the label's flagship artists. ===1990‚Äì1993: Breakthrough success=== In April 1990, Wright's first American single, \\"New Kind of Love\\", was issued and became her first \\"Top Five\\" hit in Canada, in addition to peaking at No. 32 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in the United States. Her second album, Michelle Wright, was released in July 1990. To support the album, Wright was added as an opening act to Kenny Rogers 1991 tour. The album became a success in Canada. That year, 1990, Wright was awarded Female Artist of the Year by the Canadian Country Music Association. The following year she was awarded Album of the Year for Michelle Wright, Single of the Year for \\"New Kind of Love\\", and Female Artist of the Year again by the Canadian Country Music Association. Due to the success of her album Michelle Wright and single \\"New Kind of Love,\\" Wright relocated to Nashville, Tennessee in 1991 to spend more time advancing her career. When in Nashville, Wright began to record her third album, Now and Then, released in May 1992. The album's first single, \\"Take It Like a Man\\", became an instant hit, reaching No. 1 in Canada on the RPM Country Tracks chart and No. 10 in the United States on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. In Canada, the song also crossed over to the adult contemporary charts, peaking at No. 18\\\\. The song received the Single of the Year award from the Canadian Country Music Association in late 1992. In 1993, the album earned Wright the award for Top New Female Vocalist from the Academy of Country Music. She appeared on the CBS television special, Women of Country, where she performed \\"Take It Like a Man\\" and the Mary Chapin Carpenter song, \\"The Hard Way,\\" with several other artists including Carpenter. Now and Then went on to produce six more singles, including the Canadian number one hits \\"One Time Around\\" and \\"Guitar Talk\\". The album also contained the single, \\"He Would Be Sixteen\\", which reached No. 31 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart and No. 3 on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart. It was awarded Single of the Year by the Canadian Country Music Association in 1993. Also in 1993, Wright won the Fans' Choice Award from Canadian Country Music Association, which she would also win in 1995. ===1994‚Äì1999: Further success=== In 1994, Wright released the first single from her upcoming album, \\"One Good Man\\", which became her fourth number one single in Canada; but it didn't reach the top 40 in the United States. Wright's fourth album, The Reasons Why, was released in September 1994 in Canada. Plans for the album to be released in the United States were delayed and eventually cancelled. The album was also released in Europe after a Wright completed a successful tour in mid-1994. In early 1995, Wright embarked on a 40-city tour in Canada, which at that time was the most extensive tour in the history of country music in Canada. In August 1996, Wright released her fifth album, For Me It's You, following the release of the first single, \\"Nobody's Girl\\", which reached No. 1 on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks and No. 57 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. The album marked Wright's first album to be released in the American market in four years. The album went on to be successful in Canada, producing three Top Five singles in \\"Crank My Tractor\\", \\"The Answer Is Yes\\", and \\"What Love Looks Like\\". The album was not a success in the United States. In a 1997 interview with Jam!, Wright admitted that she was \\"very disappointed\\" and \\"not happy with what [U.S. radio] did with this album\\". During 1997, Wright was awarded the C.F. Martin Humanitarian Award by the Canadian Country Music Association for her international work with the Special Olympics; her successful fundraising efforts for St. Joseph's Hospital in Chatham, Ontario, the hospital where she was born; and her support for the Manitoba flood relief fund. In 1999, U.S. radio welcomed Wright back when her 1997 duet with pianist Jim Brickman was released to radio. The song, \\"Your Love\\", failed at country radio, but gave Wright her only American adult contemporary hit when the song peaked at No. 19 on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. Despite the song's success at AC radio, it would be Wright's last charting single in the United States. In October 1999, Wright's first greatest hits album, The Greatest Hits Collection, was released in Canada. The album included two new songs, \\"I Surrender\\" and \\"When I Found You\\", both of which were Top Ten hits on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart. In 2000, Arista Nashville released the American version of her 1999 greatest hits album in the United States. The album contained a different track list than the Canadian version. The album was Wright's final release with Arista Nashville. ===2000‚Äìpresent: Success today=== In 2002, Wright was transferred to RCA Records/ViK. Recordings. That year she released her sixth studio album, Shut Up and Kiss Me, in June 2002. The album showed Wright in a more pop-driven styled than her previous work. Wright co-wrote eight of the album's twelve songs, and recorded songs by successful songwriters such as Shelly Peiken, who wrote pop singer Christina Aguilera's 1999 hit, \\"What a Girl Wants\\". Shut Up and Kiss Me also contained a more pop-oriented version of her 2000 single, \\"I Surrender.\\" This version had been used for the song's music video and pop radio release. In 2004, Wright started her annual Christmas tour, Dreaming of a Wright Christmas. A year later Wright signed with Icon Records and in October 2005, she released her first Christmas album, A Wright Christmas in Canada.

In June 2006, Wright returned to country music by releasing her first new album in four years, Everything and More in Canada. In 2007, Everything and More was made available digitally in United States. In 2011, Savannah Music Canada released Wright's first live album, The Wright Songs: An Acoustic Evening with Michelle Wright. The album features seventeen tracks, including singles and unreleased album cuts. Wright released a new single, \\"Another Good Day,\\" to Canadian country radio on April 24, 2012. She released a new single entitled \\"Strong\\" to radio in April 2013. Wright's first album of original material in seven years, Strong, was released on July 9, 2013. In 2015, Wright signed with Chuck Thompson, President of the Nashville- based Thompson Entertainment Group, for management. In 2018, she signed with Navigator Records and the label released her first brand new music since the release of Strong. \\"Lovin' This Day\\" and \\"Attitude Is Everything\\" were released as singles with an \\"old-school\\" A side song and a B side song configuration across all digital platforms on the Navigator Records label. For 2019, Navigator released Wright's recording of the holiday classic \\"Silver Bells,\\" produced by fellow Candian Bob Funk, to launch the A Wright Christmas: 2019 with concert dates across Alberta and Ontario. ===Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame Induction=== In 2011, Wright was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame at a special gala dinner and award ceremony in Hamilton, Ontario. Wright, the year's artist inductee, was recognized for her outstanding contributions to Canada's country music landscape. Wright has been acknowledged within the collections of the National Music Centre in Calgary, Alberta since 2014. ===Other work=== Wright appeared as a country music star in an episode in Season 4 of the Canadian TV series Due South.

It was built with ¬£21 million of public funding, including ¬£15.75 million from the UK National Lottery and additional money from the European Regional Development Fund and City Challenge. The Gallery is funded by Walsall Council and Arts Council England; this funding is further supplemented by its own income generation. Admission is free. Its first Director was Peter Jenkinson. In May 2005, former BALTIC director Stephen Snoddy was appointed as Director. ==Architecture== Designed by the architects Caruso St John after winning an international design competition, it opened in January 2000, replacing the town's old gallery and an arts centre that had been closed by the Council almost a decade earlier. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 5 May 2000, during her visit to the West Midlands. The New Art Gallery's stark building won several architectural awards and attracted over 237,000 visitors in its opening year. In 2000, the gallery was shortlisted for the prestigious Sterling Architecture Prize. The five-story building is clad in pale terracotta and has a floor area of . The interior of the Gallery features a heavy use of concrete and 75mm thick douglas fir wooden cladding. The public square surrounding the building was designed by Richard Wentworth and Catherine Yass. The Gallery has been seen as an attempt to encourage regeneration in the local area. The architecture has been both praised and criticised, described as \\"almost flawless\\" by the RIBA and \\"extraordinarily good\\" by Hugh Pearman but also castigated by John Stewart-Young as an \\"architectural indulgence\\", an impressive building that lacks consideration of how the wider public will use it. Cited in The essayist Theodore Dalrymple described the interior as resembling both \\"a fascist foreign ministry\\" and \\"a sauna of gigantic proportions\\". There have been a number of minor alterations to the building since its opening, including changing of the ground floor retail area into a cafe, and addition of more windows around its entrance. In 2006, Floor 4 of the gallery was transformed from a restaurant area into a new gallery space. The gallery space with 8m high ceiling has enabled the Gallery to present a further programme of exhibitions, in addition to its main temporary exhibition galleries. This has included exhibitions by regional and internationally renowned artists including David Batchelor, Richard Billingham and Leo Fitzmaurice. In 2012, artist Sarah Staton was commissioned to design a new sculpture terrace for the Gallery, opening to the public later that same year the space converted a previously underused area of patio on floor 4. ==Collections== Sorrow The Gallery houses the fixed Garman Ryan Collection of sculptures and paintings by modern masters including a large selection of work by Jacob Epstein and many significant works by European artists including Vincent Van Gogh, Claude Monet, Turner, Corot, Renoir and Constable represented in prints, sketches, drawings, paintings and sculptures.A Shared Vision: The Garman Ryan Collection, by Shelia McGregor, Merrell Publishershttp://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/collections-and-library The collection was donated to the people of Walsall in 1973 by Epstein's late wife Kathleen Garman (Lady Epstein) and her friend Sally Ryan. In 2006, the gallery acquired the Epstein Archive, a collection of photographs, manuscripts, sketches and correspondence between Jacob Epstein and his family and friends, patrons, buyers and galleries. In 2009 Bob and Roberta Smith was commissioned to work alongside Archive Curator Neil Lebeter to reveal the previously undocumented and unseen Epstein Archive to audiences.

The works that comprise this collection transfer ownership to Walsall Council from the Contemporary Art Society in 2014. In 2007, the New Art Gallery was awarded ¬£1million through the Art Fund International to collect international contemporary art on the theme of the metropolis. This has included the acquisition of works by Jochem Hendricks, Grazia Toderi, Dynita Singh, Zhang Enli, Christiane Baumgartner, Barry McGee and Nicolas Provost. ==Exhibitions== The temporary exhibition galleries on the third and fourth floor are dedicated to exhibiting contemporary and historic art.

Maj. Gen. Ormsby M. Mitchel received orders to take his division to Huntsville, Alabama, to repair railroads in the area. Soon, he occupied more than 100 miles along the Nashville & Chattanooga and Memphis & Charleston railroads. In May, Mitchel and his men sparred with Maj. Gen.

Gen. James Negley with a small division to lead an expedition to capture Chattanooga. This force arrived before Chattanooga on June 7. Negley ordered the 79th Pennsylvania Infantry out to reconnoiter. It found the Confederates entrenched on the opposite side of the river along the banks and atop Cameron Hill. Negley brought up two artillery batteries to open fire on the Rebel troops and the town and sent infantry to the river bank to act as sharpshooters. The Union bombardment of Chattanooga continued throughout June 7 and until noon on June 8. The Confederates replied, but it was uncoordinated since the undisciplined gunners were allowed to do as they wished. On June 10, Smith, who had arrived on June 8, reported that Negley had withdrawn and the Confederate loss was minor. This attack on Chattanooga was a warning that Union troops could mount assaults when they wanted. The attack also prompted Edmund Kirby Smith to withdraw Confederate troops from other areas to defend Chattanooga. This redeployment of troops allowed George W. Morgan to capture the Cumberland Gap on June 18, 1862. ==Battlefield preservation== The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield.

The crossing consists of 16 pylons: two suspension pylons, both 158 metres (518 feet) tall, that carry the line over the Bay of C√°diz, two strainer portals built of concrete, and at each strainer portal a group of 6 monopolar strainers, which are used to carry the conductors from the strainer portal to the first standard line tower (at the northern end of the span) respectively to the switchyard of C√°diz Substation (at the southern end of the span). The strainer portal at the southern end is situated close to C√°diz Substation, that of the northern end at Matagorda. The rest of the line consists of pylons with three crossbars carrying six conductors. The powerline crossing does not use a ground conductor in the span section despite its great height. == Design and construction == Each tower is a hollow mast resembling a truncated cone (or frustum). The diameter of the frustum decreases from 20.7 metres at the base to six metres at the top. The towers, which rest on reinforced concrete plinths carry on their pinnacle a single crossbar with rhomboid profile, on which the insulators carrying the conductors are fixed. A helical staircase winds its way up the interior of the structure to the top. This unconventional design was conceived and designed by Italian engineer Alberto M. Toscano. It was chosen because Spanish steel mills were unable to produce massive steel carriers at the time, and importing such carriers was impossible in Francoist Spain. The construction was carried out under the supervision and direction of Remo Scalla, a close friend of Toscano. The same team of Toscano, the designer, and Scalla, the builder, also joined forces in building the Pylons of Messina which support the lines that span the Strait of Messina, between Calabria, on the mainland of Italy, and the island of Sicily. The C√°diz project started during the latter part of 1957 and concluded in 1960. Upon completion, the towers were acquired by the Spanish National Institute of Industry. thumb == See also == * Costa de la Luz * List of towers * The Shukhov Tower on the Oka River near Nizhniy Novgorod, Russia, has a similar design == References == == External links == * * http://www.skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b45670 * http://www.skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b45671 * Google Maps: Matagorda Pylon (Pylon on Mainland) * Google Maps: Puntales Pylon (Pylon at Cadiz) * Panoramio: picture. * A set on Flickr. * Picture of the strainer Category:Buildings and structures in Andalusia Category:Electric power infrastructure in Spain Cadiz Category:Towers in Spain Category:Powerline river crossings Category:Towers completed in 1960 Category:Energy in Andalusia ","title":"Pylons of C√°diz"},{"id":"1269758","text":"Bhojpur () is one of two urban municipalities in Bhojpur District of Province No. 1 of Nepal.

Some of these troops were diverted while returning to Britain from India, others were sent from garrisons in the Mediterranean and elsewhere. Lieutenant General Sir George White was appointed to command this enlarged force. White was 64 years old and suffered from a leg injury incurred in a riding accident. Having served mainly in India, he had little previous experience in South Africa. ==Outbreak of war== Contrary to the advice of several British officials such as Sir Alfred Milner, the High Commissioner for Southern Africa, the Boer governments were not over-awed by the despatch of British troops to Natal. Instead, they regarded it as evidence of Britain's determination to seize control of the Boer republics. The Transvaal government under President Paul Kruger considered launching an attack in September, but President Steyn of the Orange Free State, who would later become the spiritual heart of the Boer resistance, dissuaded them for several weeks while he tried to act as intermediary. With the complete breakdown in negotiations, both republics declared war and attacked on 12 October. A total of 21,000 Boers advanced into Natal from all sides.Pakenham, p.106 White had been advised to deploy his force far back, well clear of the area of northern Natal known as the \\"Natal Triangle\\", a wedge of land lying between the two Boer republics.Pakenham, pp. 97, 107 Instead, White deployed his forces around the garrison town of Ladysmith, with a detachment even further forward at Dundee. The entire British force could concentrate only after fighting two battles at Talana Hill and Elandslaagte. As the Boers surrounded Ladysmith, White ordered a sortie by his entire force to capture the Boer artillery. The result was the disastrous Battle of Ladysmith, in which the British were driven back into the town having lost 1,200 men killed, wounded, or captured. ==Siege== Sketch map of the positions in November 1899 The Boers then proceeded to surround Ladysmith and cut the railway link to Durban. Major General French and his Chief of Staff, Major Douglas Haig escaped on the last train to leave, which was riddled with bullets. This town was then besieged for 118 days. White knew that large reinforcements were arriving, and could communicate with British units south of the Tugela River by searchlight and heliograph. He expected relief soon. Meanwhile, his troops carried out several raids and sorties to sabotage Boer artillery. Louis Botha commanded the Boer detachment which first raided Southern Natal, and then dug in north of the Tugela to hold off the relief force. On 15 December 1899, the first relief attempt was defeated at the Battle of Colenso. Temporarily unnerved, the relief force commander, General Redvers Henry Buller, suggested that White either break out or destroy his stores and ammunition and surrender. White could not break out because his horses and draught animals were weak from lack of grazing and forage, but also refused to surrender. On Christmas Day 1899, the Boers fired into Ladysmith a carrier shell without fuze, which contained a Christmas pudding, two Union Flags and the message \\"compliments of the season\\". The shell is still kept in the museum at Ladysmith. ==Battle of Wagon Hill (or Platrand)== Imperial Light Horse Memorial on Platrand Ladysmith () ‚Äî at the location of the Battle of Wagon Hill in which 30 men from the regiment died and whose names are engraved on the monument. The Boers around Ladysmith were also growing weak from lack of forage. With little action, many fighters took unauthorised leave or brought their families into the siege encampments. Eventually, with the Tugela in flood, preventing Buller from giving any support, some younger leaders persuaded Joubert to order a storming attempt on the night of 5 January 1900, before another relief attempt could be made. The British line south of Ladysmith ran along a ridge known as the Platrand. The occupying British troops had named its features Wagon Hill to the west and to the east Caesar's Camp (after features near Aldershot, well known to much of the British army). Under Ian Hamilton, they had constructed a line of forts, sangars and entrenchments on the reverse slope of the Platrand, of which the Boers were unaware. In the early hours of 6 January 1900, Boer storming parties under General C.J. de Villiers began climbing Wagon Hill and Caesar's Camp. They were spotted and engaged by British working parties who were emplacing some guns. The Boers captured the edge of both features, but could not advance further. British counter-attacks also failed. At noon, de Villiers made another attack on Wagon Hill. Some exhausted defenders panicked and fled, but Hamilton led reserves to the spot and recaptured some empty gun pits. Late in the afternoon, a terrific rainstorm broke, and the Boers withdrew under cover of it. The British suffered 175 killed and 249 wounded. 52 dead Boers were left in the British positions, but their total casualties were not recorded. ==Later siege and relief== The Relief of Ladysmith. Painting by John Henry Frederick Bacon (1868‚Äì1914) Rejoicing in St. Andrews, Canada upon receipt of the news of the relief of Ladysmith While Buller made repeated attempts to fight his way across the Tugela, the defenders of Ladysmith suffered increasingly from shortage of food and other supplies, and from disease, mainly enteric fever or typhoid, which claimed among many others, the life of noted war correspondent G.W. Steevens. The Boers had long before captured Ladysmith's water supply, and the defenders could use only the muddy Klip River. Towards the end of the siege, the garrison and townsfolk were living largely on their remaining draught oxen and horses (mainly in the form of \\"chevril\\", a meat paste named after the commercial beef extract \\"Bovril\\"). Eventually, Buller broke through the Boer positions on 27 February. Following their succession of reverses, his troops had developed effective tactics based on close cooperation between the infantry and artillery. After the protracted struggle, the morale of Botha's men at last broke and they and the besiegers retreated, covered by another huge thunderstorm. Buller did not pursue, and White's men were too weak to do so. The first party of the relief column, under Major Hubert Gough and of which Winston Churchill was a part, rode in on the evening of 28 February.Churchill, W.S. London to Ladysmith via Pretoria, London: Longmans, Green & Co. 1900, pp. 208‚Äì10 White reportedly greeted them saying, \\"Thank God we kept the flag flying\\". ==Aftermath== Varieties of ammunition collected at Ladysmith The relief was widely celebrated, followed by much larger celebrations after the Siege of Mafeking. There were four Victoria Crosses awarded during the siege: John Norwood on 30 October 1899, at Wagon Hill on 6 January 1900, Herman Albrecht and Robert James Thomas Digby- Jones (who both died), and James Edward Ignatius Masterson. ==Medical treatment during the siege== Early in the siege an agreement between George Stuart White and Piet Joubert led to the creation of the neutral Intombi Military Hospital some outside Ladysmith. This was run by Major General (later Sir) David Bruce and his wife Mary.Stirling's Talking Stones During the siege, the number of beds in the hospital camp grew from the initial 100 to a total of 1900. A total of 10,673 admissions were received and treated at Intombi. One train per day was allowed to carry wounded from Ladysmith to Intombi. ==Notable casualties during the siege== * Arthur Stark, author of The Birds of South Africa, was killed after being hit by an unexploded Boer shell in the Royal Hotel. * George Warrington Steevens, British author and war correspondent, of enteric fever. ==See also== *Battle of Ladysmith *Relief of Ladysmith *Clive MacDonnell Dixon *Military history of South Africa, specifically the Second Boer War *William Henry Wright ==References== ==Bibliography== * Available as . * Kruger, Rayne; Goodbye Dolly Gray, New English Library, 1964. * McElwee, William; The Art of War: Waterloo to Mons, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1974. . * Pakenham, Thomas; The Boer War, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1979, . * Reitz, Deneys (1929).

It is one of four remaining finch-billed Hawaiian honeycreepers, and is closely related to the smaller Nihoa finch. The Laysan finch is named for Laysan, the island to which it was endemic on its discovery. It was subsequently introduced to a few other atolls, and its historical range included some of the main islands. ==Description== The Laysan finch is a large honeycreeper with a heavy bill. Overall the male has yellow plumage with a whitish belly and a grey neck. The female is duller than the male, with brown streaking. It is almost impossible to confuse the Laysan finch with any other bird in the field as it is the only passerine species found on the few islands it lives on. ==Range and behavior== ===Range=== On its discovery the Laysan finch was an endemic resident of the small island of Laysan, along with the Laysan rail (Porzana palmeri), the Laysan honeycreeper (Himatione fraithii), the Laysan duck (Anas laysanensis), and the Laysan millerbird (Acrocephalus familiaris familiaris). Populations were introduced to several islands, including Pearl and Hermes Atoll, where the species persists, and Midway Atoll, where it survived until the introduction of rats. The fossil record shows that the finch once had a greater range in Hawaii, reaching as far as Oahu, and that birds on Laysan represent a relict population. ===Behavior=== The Laysan finch nests in vegetation, laying three eggs in a cup-shaped nest. These are incubated for 16 days by the female, the male in turn feeding the female. The chicks fledge after three weeks, and are cared for by the parents for another three weeks. The Laysan finch is a generalist, feeding on seeds, small insects, fruit, carrion (of seabirds and Hawaiian monk seals), and the eggs of nesting seabirds. While unable to break into the eggs of the larger seabirds (such as albatross and boobies) they will scavenge from them. They actively take the eggs of smaller seabirds such as those of white tern (Gygis alba) and the endemic Laysan duck (Anas laysanensis). ==Conservation== The Laysan finch is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN because of its highly restricted range and vulnerability to extremes of weather, and it is considered endangered by the State of Hawaii and U.S. government. It survived the devastating effects of the introduction of domestic rabbits (unlike the Laysan millerbird, honeycreeper and rail) by taking carrion and seabird eggs. Laysan is now part of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge. The population is considered stable with the biggest threat being uncontrollable climate change. ==Gallery== File:Telespiza cantans Laysan Island.jpgOn Laysan Image:TelespizaCantansKeulemans.jpgIllustration File:Telespiza cantans -Laysan, Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, USA -three-8.jpgHabitat File:TelespizaFlavissima Ei.jpgNest ==References== * Morin, M.

Cilliers is depicted standing on a gun carriage making the Blood River vow. Kroonstad (Afrikaans directly translated \\"Crown City\\") is the third largest city in the Free State (after Bloemfontein and Welkom) and lies two hours drive on the N1 from Gauteng. Maokeng is an area within Kroonstad, and is occasionally used as a synonym of the town itself. It is the second-largest commercial and urban centre in the Northern Free State (after Welkom), and an important railway junction on the main line from Cape Town to Johannesburg. Maokeng is Sesotho and means \\"place of the thorn trees (mimosa trees)\\". ==History== Kroonstad was established in 1855 by the Irish pioneer Joseph Orpen, and was the first founded after the independence of the Orange Free State. While ' means \\"crown\\", this was in fact the name of a horse that had drowned in the nearby ford. A lover of animals, Orpen had witnessed the incident, and named the infant settlement in honour of the unfortunate creature. Similarly, the ford in question came to be known as Kroondrift. During the Second Boer War, from 13 March to 11 May 1900, the city became the capital of the Orange Free State, and subsequently the site of a British concentration camp to contain Boer women and children. ==Economy== The main industry of Kroonstad is agriculture. It is the centre of a rich agricultural district, producing maize, wheat, dairy and meat products and wool. The Bloemhoek Dam lies just east of the town and supplies much of its water needs. A caravan park and many more camp sites on the banks of the willow-lined Vals River (Valsrivier) are frequented by anglers and watersport enthusiasts. ==Leisure== Leisure opportunities are plentiful in Kroonstad, where visitors can enjoy golf on the 18-hole course in the town, lion tours and interaction with lion and tiger cubs at the Boskoppie Lion and Tiger Park, fishing in the well stocked Vals River or on the Bloemhoek Dam, and boating on the Serfontein Dam. Horseriding, gliding and hiking trails are also available. ==Transport== ===Road=== Kroonstad lies directly on the N1, and bypasses the town to the east. Other regional roads in the town are the R34 to Odendaalsrus (south- west), the R76 to Steynsrus (south-east), the R721 to Vredefort (north-west) and the R82 to Heilbron (north-east). ===Rail=== Kroonstad Railway Station serves the town and is located on the important railway junction from Cape Town to Johannesburg via Bloemfontein. On 4 January 2018, a passenger train, operated by Shosholoza Meyl, collided with a truck on a level crossing near Kroonstad/Hennenman. The train was derailed, and at least one of the carriages caught fire. Twenty people were killed and 260 were injured. ===Air=== Kroonstad is served by a small airport with no passenger flights. ==Shopping== Shopping in Kroonstad is characterised by typical high street shopping. The development of the new Kroonstad Waterfront Mall is underway, Maokeng Mall, Panorama Plaza, Checkers Centre, Shoprite Centre and Pick'n'Pay centre. ==General attractions== Kroonstad is said to be one of the Free State‚Äôs loveliest towns and lies on the banks of the Vals River, a tributary of the Vaal, roughly two hours‚Äô drive from Johannesburg. It is situated in an area characterised by open spaces and an abundant variety of vegetation that makes it particularly beautiful. Kroonstad is a quaint town that serves as a good stop over en route between Johannesburg and Bloemfontein, lying as it does at virtually the halfway mark. Kroonstad offers an array of activities that include flea markets, a tea garden, fishing on the Vals River or at the Bloemhoek Dam, walking trails and lion tours and lion and tiger interaction at Boskoppie Lion and Tiger park. Today, as an important administrative, agricultural and educational centre, Kroonstad still boasts much of the inherent rugged beauty which led the Voortrekkers to establish the town where they did. Sporting facilities of all kinds are well catered for, notably for jukskei, an Afrikaner folk sport. The headquarters of the SA Jukskei Council has been established here since 1951. The city is rich in historical sights; several historic buildings and statues, a former concentration camp, the Sarel Cilliers Museum (although currently inactive) and other places of national interest can be found here. Kroonstad is an important agricultural service centre in the Free State with a predominantly agricultural-orientated economy served by a modern toll-road. This brings the PWV Region within two hours drive from Kroonstad as well as being accessible from the North West, Bloemfontein and the Eastern Free State. ==Historical sites== Correspondents await the arrival of Lord Roberts during the Second Boer War, 1901 The Bloemspruit Monument commemorates those who died in the Kroonstad Concentration Camp, A Garden of Remembrance commemorates Allied soldiers fallen in the two World Wars. A blockhouse south of the city is a reminder of later stages of the Second Boer War. Stone corbelled huts, refuges for the prehistoric inhabitants of the region, occur in various locations about the city. In addition, fossils and San rock art are present in the region. ==Notable people== * Banele Gaza, Record Producer * Sid James, actor * David Kau, Comedian * Steve Komphela, football coach * Antjie Krog, poet * Pallo Jordan, Former ANC Politician * Teboho Mahlatsi, writer, co-creator, film producer * Fana Mokoena, actor & EFF politician * Jeffrey Ntuka, football player * Max du Preez, journalist * Levy Sekgapane, operatic tenor * Al J Venter, writer and journalist * Robbie Wessels, singer * Mantoa Tshabala- Msimang, Former ANC Politician * Mosiuoa Lekota, Former ANC Politician * Winkie Direko, Former ANC Politician ==Coat of arms== By 1931, the Kroonstad municipal council had assumed a coat of arms.The arms were depicted on a cigarette card issued in 1931.

Unlike other marmosets, Wied's marmoset lives in groups consisting of 4 or 5 females and 2 or 3 males (plus children). They are matriarchal, and only the dominant female is allowed to mate. Like other marmosets, the offspring are always born in pairs. ==Diet== This monkey supplements its diet of sap with fruit, nectar, flowers and seeds, as well as spiders and insects. Since these are harvested from the middle and lower part of the forest, Wied's marmoset often travels and forages in the company of the golden-headed lion tamarin, which forages in the canopy. ==Natural Predators== Wied's marmoset is eaten by birds of prey (the harpy eagle, the gray hawk, the roadside hawk and the white-tailed hawk), felines (the jaguar, jaguarundi and ocelot) and snakes. ==Behavior== Wied's marmoset is highly social, spending much of its time grooming. It has individually distinctive calls, and it communicates through gestures and olfactory markings as well. ==Appearance== The coloring of Wied's marmoset is mostly black, with white markings on cheeks and forehead. It has rings on its tail and black tufts of fur coming out of its ears. ==Chimerism== Wied's marmoset at southern Bahia. Chimeric individuals carry two or more genetic cell lines in their bodies, each of which stems from a separate and genetically distinct zygote. This chimerism is the result of cell lines exchanged between siblings in utero. These two original zygotes were fertilized by two different sperm, which potentially came from more than one male. Therefore, chimeric individuals exhibit a phenotype that is the result of more than one genotype, and potentially more than one father. Researchers first discovered chimerism in the bone marrow of marmosets in the 1960s. More recent work has shown that chimerism can occur in all cell lines, including germ cells. This allows for the possibility of horizontal inheritance. In other words, individuals could pass on the genotype that is different from their majority (or self) genotype. Consider a father marmoset was chimeric in his germ line. This father could potentially pass on his secondary cell line (the majority or self cell line of his brother) to his offspring. In this way, this father's offspring would be more genetically similar to their uncle than to their father. Since chimerism changes the degrees of relatedness between individuals, it also changes the adaptive value of certain behaviors, like cooperatively raising young. It has been proposed that chimerism creates a system that makes it evolutionarily advantageous for an individual to cooperate to raise its siblings; this closely matches to the way marmoset social systems have been observed to function in the wild. ==References== ==External links== * Animal Diversity Web: Callithrix kuhlii Wied's marmoset Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Wied's marmoset Wied's marmoset ","title":"Wied's marmoset"},{"id":"1269828","text":"The Battle of Caer Caradoc was the final battle in Caratacus's resistance to Roman rule. Fought in 50 AD, the Romans defeated the Britons and thus secured the southern areas of the province of Britannia. ==Location== Caratacus chose a battlefield in hilly country, placing the Britons on the higher ground. His forces were probably primarily made up of warriors from the Ordovices, though there may have been some Silures as well. This position made both approach and retreat difficult for the Romans, and comparatively easy for his own forces. Where the slope was shallow, he built rough stone ramparts, and placed armed men in front of them. In front of them was a river which appeared difficult to cross, but in the event the Roman troops crossed it easily. ==The battle== The Roman commander, Publius Ostorius Scapula, was reluctant to assault the British lines, but the enthusiasm of his men won him over. The river was crossed without difficulty. The Roman soldiers came under a rain of missiles, but employed the testudo formation to protect themselves and dismantled the stone ramparts. Once inside the defences, the Romans broke through in bloody fighting. The Britons withdrew to the hilltops, but the Romans kept up the pursuit. The Britons' lines broke, and they were caught between the heavily armed legionaries and the lightly armed auxiliaries. ==Aftermath== Caratacus's wife, son, and daughter were captured and his brother surrendered, but Caratacus himself escaped. He fled north, seeking refuge among the Brigantes. The Brigantian queen, Cartimandua, however, was loyal to Rome, and she handed him over in chains. He was exhibited as part of the Emperor Claudius's Roman triumph in Rome. He gave a speech which persuaded the emperor to spare him and his family. His defeat was publicly likened by the Senators to some of Rome's greatest victories, and Ostorius Scapula was awarded triumphal ornaments for defeating him. ==Suggested sites== The site of the battle is unknown. The hill fort on Caer Caradoc Hill in Shropshire is connected with the battle by virtue of its name. Local legend places it at British Camp in the Malvern Hills. However, the Severn, though visible from the latter location, is too distant to fit Tacitus's description of the site, and the Severn is not visible from the former location. A position just west of Caersws, where the remains of earthworks still stand, has also been suggested, as has a location near Chapel Lawn, Shropshire. ==References== *Tacitus, Annals 12:33-38 *Sheppard Frere, Britannia: a History of Roman Britain, 3rd edition, 1978, p. 64 Category:50 Caer Caradoc Caer Caradoc 50 Caer Caradoc 50 Caer Caradoc Category:History of Shropshire Category:1st century in Great Britain Category:50s in the Roman Empire Category:1st-century battles ","title":"Caratacus's last battle"},{"id":"1269829","text":"Taplejung or Phungling Municipality is a municipality and the headquarters of Taplejung District in the Mechi Zone of Nepal.

Taple was the medieval Limbu king who used to rule the area and \\"jung\\" in Limbu language means fort. Literally, Taplejung means Fort of King Taple. ==Geography== Taplejung is in northeastern Nepal; the Tamur River flows through the district. The area is home of Kangchenjunga (8586 m), the third highest mountain in the world. Taplejung has an airstrip with commercial flights to Biratnagar and Kathmandu. A road connects the district headquarters with the Tarai plains. Most of the population are involved in agriculture, and the vegetation zones range from sub-tropical to temperate forests, alpine meadows, and snow, and ice. Taplejung is one of the most beautiful areas in eastern Nepal, with a spectacular landscape, Himalayan peaks of heights above 7000 meters and a wide range of flora and fauna. Alpine grassland, rocky outcrops, dense temperate and subtropical forests, and no river valleys make up the region. Taplejung occupies an area ranging from 670 meters to 8586 meters (Mt. Kangchenjunga) above sea level. Kumbhakarna is an outlier of Kangchenjunga. Offering some of the most spectacular Himalayan landscapes with 13 of the world‚Äôs highest mountain peaks rising above 7000 m, Taplejung plays host to the longest blue glacier in the world, the Yalung, and a high biodiversity rate. This area is home to a diverse range of ethnic groups like the Limbu, Tibetans, Sherpas, Gurung, Magars, Newars and Tamangs. The Kanchenjunga Conservation Area (KCA) in the eastern Himalaya boasts some of the most stunning scenery in all of Nepal. Traditional farming practices are a way of life here. There are rich forests with more than 250 species of bird and animal life. There are a number of high mountain lakes in Olangchung Gola. The area is made up of alpine grass lands, rocky outcrops, dense temperate and sub-tropical forests, and low river valleys with the Kanchenjunga as its crown and is home to one of the original homelands of the indigenous Limbu people. == Demography == The main inhabitants of Taplejung are Limbu, Chhetri, Tamang, Brahman, Sherpa, Bhote, Newar, and Gurung. == Transportation == Taplejung Municipality is linked with roadway and airway. It is connected to rest of the country through the Mechi Highway, a 268-km road which begins in Kechana of Jhapa district and ends in Taplejung. Passenger buses and jeeps to Taplejung are easily available in Birtamod. Suketar Airport has flights from Biratnagar and Kathmandu. == Media == To promote local culture Taplejung has 3 FM radio stations: Radio Tamor - 102.0 MHz which is a community radio station, Taplejung F.M. - 94.0 MHz and Radio Faktanglung 89.8 MHz. ==Culture== Residents practise integrated early animist religions. Agriculture, animal husbandry and tourism are the major means of livelihood for Limbu people. In the higher altitudes, one can find sherpa people where they arrived from Tibet more than 400 years ago. These sherpas have a distinct culture and tradition from those in Solukhumbu District in the Sagarmatha region. The icons of the cultural heritage are monasteries, chhortens, temples and prayer walls. And to add to the flavour, the festivals of all of these people living in harmony only serve to make the native culture livelier. ==Pathibhara Devi Temple== One of the major attractions is the Pathibhara Devi Temple. This little-known region attracts tourists seeking spiritual fulfillment and blessings from the powerful Pathibhara Devi. Kiranti, Hindus and Buddhists reach the temple for celebrations during special occasions. The trek to pathibhara Devi (3794 m) combined with the natural and cultural experiences of the region make the visit a unique exhilarating experience. It takes a day to reach the temple on foot from Taplejung Bazaar. On the way to the temple are many species of rhododendron which are unique. ==Notable person== *Chhurim, mountaineer, first woman to climb Everest twice in the same season. * Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe: Limbu martyr and legend. * Sukra Raj Sonyok: Politician *Til Kumar Menyangbo Limbu: Politician *Surya Man Gurung:Politician *Ghar Singh Yangden *Sanduk Ruit ==References== *http://cbs.gov.np/?p=2444 *https://web.archive.org/web/20141027133326/http://cbs.gov.np/wp- content/uploads/2014/04/01%20Taplejung_VDCLevelReport.pdf ==External links== *UN map of the municipalities of Taplejung District Category:Populated places in Taplejung District Category:Nepal municipalities established in 2014 Category:Cities, towns and urban municipalities in Province No. 1 Category:Hill stations in Nepal ","title":"Taplejung"},{"id":"1269831","text":"Roosta or Rustah (in Persian: ÿ±Ÿàÿ≥ÿ™ÿß) was the name of a district in Isfahan area in Iran attested in historical sources.

With Chivas, Garc√≠a made a last minute goal against his current team Chiapas F.C.. This secured Chivas a semi-final berth, where it played against Pachuca and managed another last minute goal. During the 2007 Draft Santos Laguna acquired him from Chiapas F.C. ==References== * Johnny Garcia at MedioTiempo.com Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Guadalajara, Jalisco Category:Association football defenders Category:Mexican footballers Category:C.D.

He opened a wrestling school with Ken Anderson, brother Ariya Daivari, Molly Holly, and Arik Cannon in Minneapolis, Minnesota, called The Academy: School of Professional Wrestling. == Professional wrestling career == === Early career === Daivari grew up admiring Mick Foley and Bret Hart. His childhood hero was Shawn Michaels. He participated in his first professional wrestling match at age 15. He started his career in the upper midwest independent scene. He is known for representing Iran for international title matches. On October 19, 1998, Daivari appeared on Nitro as a fan being interviewed by Mike Tenay. He appeared on the February 26, 2003, episode of Explosion and wrestled a tag team match against Mike Sanders and Glenn Gilberti with Ken Anderson. He also appeared on the October 5, 2003, episode of Sunday Night Heat as Shawn Daivari, losing his match against Tommy Dreamer. He also made four appearances for independent promotion Ring of Honor (ROH) between April and July 2004. === World Wrestling Entertainment === ==== Manager (2004‚Äì2005) ==== Daivari signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in August 2004 and debuted on the December 13 episode of Raw alongside Muhammad Hassan as Khosrow Daivari, later shortened to Daivari. Their gimmick was that of two Arab Americans who were tired of the prejudice and stereotypes they were receiving after the 9/11 attacks. Ironically, Daivari would scream instructions in Persian to Hassan when working as his manager, though this was often described as \\"Arabic\\" on broadcasts. In the weeks leading up to their debut, the two men would appear on Raw in vignettes promoting their hatred towards \\"America\\". In the following weeks, they would back up their words with actions, initiating a feud with Raw announcers Jim Ross and Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler. At WrestleMania 21 on April 3, 2005, Daivari and Hassan were involved in an angle with Hulk Hogan. While attacking injured wrestler Eugene, Hogan came to the ring and ejected both men from the ring. The following night on Raw, Daivari and Hassan interrupted Shawn Michaels during a promo. The two attacked Michaels and left him helpless in the ring. This led to Daivari's first singles match in WWE, on the April 11, 2005, episode of Raw. Although Michaels was heavily favored, Daivari, with help from Hassan, got the upset win. Enraged, Michaels demanded a match against both Daivari and Hassan. Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff refused to grant a handicap match, but instead ordered Michaels to find a partner. That partner turned out to be Daivari and Hassan's WrestleMania foe Hulk Hogan. On the April 18, 2005, episode of Raw, Michaels was once again double teamed by Daivari and Hassan until Hogan appeared to make the save. Hogan accepted Michaels' offer to tag and the match was set for the Backlash pay-per-view on May 1, 2005. At Backlash, Hogan and Michaels picked up the win which led to friction between the two since Hassan blamed Daivari for the loss. The next night on Raw, Hassan verbally and physically attacked Daivari leaving their future as a team in question. Daivari wrestling with Val Venis Both Daivari and Hassan were later drafted to SmackDown! on June 23, 2005, as part of a package deal. On the July 7, 2005 episode of SmackDown!, then General Manager Theodore Long put Daivari in a match against The Undertaker for that night, and Muhammad Hassan in a match against The Undertaker at The Great American Bash. Daivari was squashed easily in that match, after which Hassan began to pray on the ramp, summoning five masked men to the ring. The masked men beat and strangled The Undertaker into submission, and Hassan put him in the camel clutch. Afterward, the masked men carried Daivari off like a martyr. The controversial imagery aired unedited in North America despite the terrorist attacks in London earlier that day, but was removed from the Australian and UK broadcasts. This episode of SmackDown! was unusually taped on Monday and, at the time, aired on Thursday, so the skit was taped three days before the attack occurred. In late July, UPN requested that WWE keep the Muhammad Hassan character off of their network. WWE complied, effectively removing him from SmackDown! at The Great American Bash. After Hassan lost in a match with The Undertaker, Hassan was given the Last Ride through an open stage ramp onto a concrete floor. It was reported that he sustained serious injuries and had to be rushed to a nearby medical facility; this was an angle aimed to \\"kill off\\" the character. Although Hassan would eventually retire from professional wrestling, Daivari reported to WWE's Deep South Wrestling (DSW) developmental territory for training and repackaging. He returned from DSW and, after working in Minneapolis, made his debut in September 2005 on Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) TV returning as his \\"Sheik\\" Daivari persona. On November 7, 2005, Daivari returned to Raw, acting as Kurt Angle's anointed special guest referee in the tag team match between Shawn Michaels and John Cena against Angle and Chris Masters. During the match, Daivari favored Angle and Masters, who won the match via disqualification when Michaels was caught with a chair Angle brought in. On November 21, 2005, Kurt Angle announced that Daivari was to be the referee for all his future matches, including his WWE Championship match against John Cena for the title at Survivor Series. Mr. McMahon rescinded that at the kangaroo court trial of Eric Bischoff on Raw on December 5, 2005. Daivari remained aligned with Kurt Angle as his manager. On the January 13, 2006, episode of SmackDown!, Angle and Daivari were drafted to SmackDown!, where Angle won the World Heavyweight Championship that same night. Angle later revealed that his contract on Raw had expired, which allowed them to switch brands. Angle was already signed to face Shawn Michaels on Raw, however this non-title match went ahead, but Daivari would accidentally cost Angle the match against Michaels. Afterwards, Daivari and Angle argued, but when Daivari slapped Angle, he was Angle Slammed over the ropes and down to the floor on the outside of the ring. During the break, on WWE.com Unlimited, an enraged Angle made it known that Daivari's services were no longer needed. A short time later, Daivari faced his former client in a match, during which Mark Henry, the number one contender for Angle's title, attacked Angle. After the match, Daivari officially announced that he was now managing Henry and continued to manage Henry during his feud with The Undertaker. Daivari would not be seen on television in the weeks leading up to WrestleMania 22 when, at Saturday Night's Main Event XXXII, he suffered a chokeslam and Tombstone Piledriver at the hands of The Undertaker onto the lid of a casket. ==== Managing The Great Khali (2006‚Äì2007) ==== Daivari managed The Great Khali in 2006 On the April 7, 2006, episode of SmackDown!, Daivari made his return bringing in the debuting The Great Khali to attack The Undertaker during his match with Mark Henry. The next week, Daivari officially presented him to the crowd, hyping him as an \\"unstoppable monster\\". Over the following weeks, Daivari would accompany Khali to the ring as he attacked various SmackDown! superstars. This would all lead up to a match with The Undertaker at Judgment Day on May 21, 2006, which Khali would end up winning. Daivari and Khali appeared as guests on Piper's Pit on the June 2, 2006, episode of SmackDown!, in which Roddy Piper made fun of Khali, who supposedly couldn't speak English. Eventually Piper stood on the bottom rope, attempting to match height with Khali, he managed to say: \\"If this was twenty years ago\\", before Khali grabbed him by the throat. Daivari made Khali put Piper down and straightened Piper's jacket disrespectfully, at which Piper slapped Daivari, but was then given a chop by Khali. The Undertaker was the original guest on the Pit, but he declined the invitation a few days before. Daivari continued to accompany The Great Khali to the ring when Khali wrestled or attacked other wrestlers, but when The Great Khali became inactive due to injury, Daivari was taken off the road as well. Daivari and The Great Khali were moved to the ECW brand officially when they made their ECW debuts on the October 31, 2006, episode of ECW on Sci Fi, in which Daivari defeated \\"The Reject\\" Shannon Moore. Daivari's original theme music was used as well as his Persian rants on the microphone. Afterwards, Moore was manhandled by The Great Khali. Daivari continued his winning streak over the next several weeks with The Great Khali usually following up the contest with a chokebomb on Daivari's opponent. At December to Dismember on December 3, 2006, Daivari got a victory over Tommy Dreamer following a schoolboy roll-up. Dreamer then chased Daivari all the way to the back, but The Great Khali appeared and caught Dreamer, planting him on the steel ramp with a chokebomb. On January 8, 2007, The Great Khali debuted on Raw without Daivari. The following night, however, Daivari accompanied Khali to the ring for his match against Dreamer on ECW on Sci Fi. Daivari returned to SmackDown! on February 9, 2007, defeating then Cruiserweight Champion Gregory Helms in a non-title match. He wrestled in a Cruiserweight Open for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship at No Way Out, won by Chavo Guerrero. He began wrestling in the Cruiserweight division. He was involved in a feud between Kane and The Great Khali, once again promoting Khali in March 2007. His first match against Kane involved him being dragged backstage by Kane's chain and hook leaving his back with multiple bruises. A few weeks later, Daivari had a rematch with Kane and was again defeated. ==== Cruiserweight Championship pursuit (2007) ==== Daivari returned to SmackDown! a few months later, teaming up with Chavo Guerrero and Jamie Noble against Jimmy Wang Yang, Paul London and Brian Kendrick in a losing effort. On the June 15, 2007, episode of SmackDown!, Daivari competed in a fatal four-way number one contender match for the Cruiserweight Championship, which he lost to Yang and also involved Shannon Moore and Noble. Daivari was drafted back to Raw in the supplemental draft on June 17, 2007. He re-debuted on the June 18, 2007, episode of Raw, losing to Jeff Hardy. On the July 30, 2007 episode of Raw, Daivari was defeated by Cody Rhodes who had to win his match or else being fired from WWE. Daivari's losing streak continued when he failed to win the position of General Manager of Raw by been eliminated early in the battle royal the week after Rhodes defeated him. Daivari then started to get on a roll on Heat (Raw's sister show) being victorious against Super Crazy and \\"Hacksaw\\" Jim Duggan. His return to Raw on September 17, 2007 saw him lose to Duggan in a flag match. On October 16, 2007, Daivari was released from his WWE contract. ==== Sporadic appearances and producer role (2011, 2018‚Äì2020) ==== On May 3, 2011, Daivari made his WWE return by competing in a dark match before the SmackDown tapings, losing to Ted DiBiase. In 2018, Daivari made his second return to WWE during a segment at Greatest Royal Rumble in Saudi Arabia where he and his brother, Ariya Daivari, were driven out of the ring by four new Saudi recruits. He was later hired by WWE as a producer in January 2019, and was eventually released on April 15, 2020 as part of budget cuts stemming from the COVID-19 Pandemic. === Independent circuit (2007‚Äì2008) === Daivari, as Sheik Abdul Bashir, with the TNA X Division Championship belt Daivari made his debut for Professional Championship Wrestling in Arlington, Texas, at PCW's Heroes 2 Legends event in November 2007. He wrestled J.T. Lamotta and \\"Jiggle-O\\" James Johnson in a triple threat match for the PCW Cruiserweight Championship, which Lamotta won. He returned to PCW on February 23, 2008, at PCW's Big Bang '08 event to again wrestle a triple threat match for the PCW Cruiserweight Championship, this time against Robert Evans and Aaron Eagle, who won and became the new champion. On September 6, 2008, it was announced by The Bussey Brothers that Daivari would return on September 20, 2008, to team with them to take on Aaron Eagle and a partner of his choosing. Eagle had chosen Action Jackson to be his tag team partner. However, Jackson was injured at the hands of Mace Malone. PCW World Heavyweight Champion, Mike Foxx, who was supposedly suspended and also Eagle's main rival, surprisingly saved Eagle from an attack and announced he would be Eagle's partner. The stipulation was that if Eagle did not win, he could never get another PCW World Heavyweight Championship shot again. On September 20, Daivari and The Busseys defeated Eagle and Foxx when Foxx turned on Eagle and Daivari debuted his new finisher move, the WMD ‚Äì Weapon of Mass Destruction (a DDT to a kneeling opponent), for the victory. Afterwards, Foxx announced he would give Eagle one final title shot at Sick 'n' Twisted on October 11. On April 4, 2008, Daivari made his AMW debut in a triple threat match against Wally Darkmon and Robert Evans for the AMW Light Heavyweight Championship. Daivari won the match to become the new AMW Light Heavyweight Champion. During most of 2008, he feuded with Wally Darkmon and on September 12, 2008, he lost the AMW Light Heavyweight Championship to Darkmon in a casket match. In June 2008, Davari took part in an Irish Whip Wrestling (IWW) event in the ESB Arena of Dublin, Ireland, where he lost in the main event to Mandrake for the IWW International Heavyweight Championship. === Total Nonstop Action Wrestling === ==== X Division Champion (2008‚Äì2009) ==== Kip James Daivari debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on the June 12, 2008, episode of Impact! as the captain to Team International in 2008's World X Cup Tournament. Daivari then signed a contract with TNA. On the July 24, 2008, episode of Impact!, after the conclusion of the X Cup, it was announced that he had joined the TNA roster under the name of Sheik Abdul Bashir. Retaining his anti-American gimmick and also adding a bullying mean streak, he quickly established himself as a heel after helping Petey Williams retain the TNA X Division Championship over Consequences Creed at Hard Justice on August 10, 2008, as well as delivering promos to draw heat. His official debut match on Impact! was a victory over Jay Lethal. Bashir won the X Division Championship at No Surrender on September 14, 2008, by defeating Williams and Creed in a three-way match. At Bound for Glory IV on October 12, 2008, Bashir defeated Creed in another match for the X Division Championship. On the October 23, 2008, live episode of Impact!, Bashir successfully defended the X Division Championship against Jay Lethal. After the match, he attacked Rhino after being confronted by him over his political views. Bashir at a TNA house show in Dublin, Ireland in January 2009 On October 30, 2008, it was announced that Daivari was taken to \\"wrestler court\\" at the week's Impact! tapings following a rib he played on Kip James during a flight they shared. Daivari pulled aside a flight attendant, who then announced over the loud speaker that Kip was celebrating his 65th birthday. He was taken to wrestler court because it was determined that he hadn't spent enough time in the company to pull a rib on a veteran. Brother Ray served as the judge while B.G. James represented Kip and Brother Devon represented Daivari, and agent Pat Kenney served as the bailiff for the proceedings. Daivari was found guilty and was required to supply the locker room beer and booze, which he did on Tuesday night after the tapings.TNA Wrestler Taken to \\"Court\\" After Playing Joke Retrieved on October 30, 2008. On the November 13, 2008, episode of Impact!, Bashir lost the X Division Championship to Eric Young. During the match, Bashir shoved TNA Official Shane Sewell to the mat after Sewell questioned Bashir and the TNA audience of Bashir's actions during the match. Sewell became enraged, removed his shirt and attacked Bashir, which led Eric Young to hit his Death Valley driver on Bashir and pinning him for the win and the championship. However, Bashir was awarded the championship back the following week due to Sewell's interference, thus continuing his original title reign and making Young's title reign null and void. Sewell helped Young to defeat Bashir for the title for the second time at Final Resolution on December 7, 2008, ending Bashir's reign at 84 days. After the match, Bashir bloodied Sewell and tried to leave with the championship belt, but was stopped by Jim Cornette who announced that he had decided to vacate the championship. At Genesis on January 11, 2009, Sewell defeated Bashir in a grudge match that ended their feud. ==== The World Elite and departure (2009) ==== In July 2009, Bashir formed an alliance with Eric Young, Kiyoshi and The British Invasion (Doug Williams, Brutus Magnus and Rob Terry) known as The World Elite. They were also later joined by Homicide. At Final Resolution on December 20, 2009, Bashir took part in the \\"Feast or Fired\\" match and was able to pick up one of the four briefcases. However, the briefcase he had picked up included a pink slip, which led to him being immediately fired from the company. Daivari would later say he originally signed a two-year extension with the understanding that Jeff Jarrett would be his boss, but after Jarrett stepped down a month later, he could not see eye to eye with the new management and asked for his release. === Return to ROH (2010‚Äì2011) === Daivari made his return to ROH on February 5, 2010, at the tapings of Ring of Honor Wrestling on HDNet, once again portraying an anti-American heel. At the March 6 tapings, he joined Prince Nana's stable The Embassy. On June 19, 2010, at Death Before Dishonor VIII, he participated in a gauntlet match for Roderick Strong's ROH World Championship.

He was probably born in 1501, since his age is given as 14 in a document of 1515, and he was probably born near Poitiers. He served as a singer in the papal chapel from 1514, when he arrived there in the care of Carpentras, until 1520 when he left never to return. Since much of his music was published in the 1530s and later, he may have still been alive then and working elsewhere; presumably had he been still working in association with the papal chapel, there would be records of his employment. Penet is most famous as the composer of Descendit angelus Domini, a four-voice motet which was used both by Palestrina and Costanzo Porta as source material for mass composition. The motet circulated widely in Europe and apparently was quite popular; Penet can be seen as a kind of Renaissance one-hit wonder on the strength and popularity of this refined, elegant composition. He also wrote two settings of the Magnificat which have survived, another motet (Virgo prudentissima), as well as a handful of secular chansons, all of which are settings of current popular tunes. == References and further reading == * Article \\"Hilaire Penet,\\" in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.

It is described in the Qur'an in Surah 4:4. Regulations: *While intended to be a permanent state, it can be terminated by the husband engaging in the Talaq process or the wife seeking a Khula. *The couple inherit from each other. *A legal contract is signed when entering the marriage.

It is also known as tahleel marriage and is a practice in which a woman, after being divorced by triple talaq, marries another man, consummates the marriage, and gets divorced again in order to be able to remarry her former husband. This practice is not from sharia law and is haram. === NikƒÅ·∏• Ijtimaa === Nikah ijtimaa, or combined marriage, is a form of marriage practiced in pre-Islamic Arabia, in which multiple men would have intercourse with a woman, and if she bore a child, she would choose one of the men to be the father of the child.Although the Salafi Islamic scholar, Muhsin Khan, did not translate it in the English, the original Arabic text has Ayesha (Sahih Bukhari, Volume 2 Chapter 37, pages 44-45) This form of marriage was outlawed by Islam, which requires that any man and woman be married prior to sexual intercourse.Although the Salafi Islamic scholar, Muhsin Khan, did not translate it in the English, the original Arabic text has Ayesha (Sahih Bukhari, Volume 2 Chapter 37, pages 44-45) ===Nikah Istibdaa=== Nikah Istibdaa is a marriage ( ŸÜ⁄©ÿßÿ≠ ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿ®ÿ∂ÿßÿπ) in which a husband would send his wife to another person, usually of noble lineage, to have sexual relations with him. The husband would refrain from sexual relations with his wife until she became pregnant by the other man. Afterwards, the man would claim paternity of the conceived child. This was done to get a child of noble breed. It was eradicated by Islam.Sahih Bukhari 5127 ===NikƒÅ·∏• Misyar=== NikƒÅ·∏• Misyaar is a nikƒÅ·∏• for Sunnis carried out via the normal contractual procedure, with the specificity that the husband and wife give up several rights by their own free will, such as living together, equal division of nights between wives in cases of polygamy, the wife's rights to housing, and maintenance money (\\"nafaqa\\"), and the husband's right of homekeeping, and access etc. The difference between this and Mut'ah is that Mut'ah has the condition of a definite time period and a separation date prior to a marriage contract. Sunnah Scholars have said it is permissible to marry a woman with the intention of getting divorced, if the wife is not informed or expecting a divorce during a marriage contract.Misyar marriage ===NikƒÅ·∏• Mut‚Äòah=== NikƒÅ·∏• mut‚Äòah (Arabic: ŸÜŸÉÿßÿ≠ ŸÖÿ™ÿπÿ©) is a temporary marriage. There is controversy on the Islamic legality of this type of marriage, since Sunnis believe it was abrogated by Muhammad or Umar, while Shias do not hold this view. According to Shia Hadith: Ali (r) said ‚ÄòHad Umar not banned Mut‚Äôah then the only person to fornicate would have been a disgraceful person, since Mut‚Äôah is easy, and one can attain the objective, there would have then been no need to indulge in haraam acts. It is clear that if Mut‚Äôah‚Äôs abrogation was Sahih then Jabir would not have opposed Omar, and that if Islamic prophet outlawed it, the Companions would not have practiced it during the reign of Abu Bakr. Someone asked Abdullah bin Umar (about Mut‚Äôah) saying: ‚ÄòYour father prohibited it. (Ibn Umar replied): ‚ÄòIs the order of the Messenger of Allah, more deserving to be followed, or the order of my father?‚Äô . However, similar to normal marriages that are common among Sunnis and Shi'ias, the woman still is given her mahr, and the woman must still observe the iddah, a period of time where the woman cannot remarry. This is to ensure that there is no pregnancy from the ex-husband and thus clarifies paternal lineage. Quran 4:24 (Pickthall)- And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom your right hands possess. It is a decree of Allah for you. Lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned, so that ye seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock, not debauchery. And those of whom ye seek content (by marrying them), give unto them their portions as a duty. And there is no sin for you in what ye do by mutual agreement after the duty (hath been done). Lo! Allah is ever Knower, Wise.Quran Surah An-Nisaa ( Verse 24 ) ===NikƒÅ·∏• ShighƒÅr=== NikƒÅ·∏• ShighƒÅ is marriage (ŸÜ⁄©ÿßÿ≠ ÿ¥ÿ∫ÿßÿ±) in which two men would exchange their daughters, sisters or other close women for marriage without paying mahr. It was prohibited by Muhammad.Sahih Bukhari 6960 ===Interfaith marriage=== Muslim males may marry a non-Muslim female, specifically, one from the \\"People of the Book\\", which includes Judaism and Christianity. Conversion is optional for the woman, but she is nonetheless charged with having a proper understanding of her respective faith as well as engaging in its true and thorough practise. Muslim women have been forbidden from marrying non-Muslims to avoid her and her offspring being coerced to change her religion after marriage. ==Restrictions on marriage== ===Polygyny=== Muslim men are allowed to practise polygyny, that is, they can have more than one wife at the same time, up to a total of four, per Sura 4 Verse 3. Polyandry, the practice of a woman having more than one husband, by contrast, is not permitted. One of the main reasons for this would be the potential questioning of paternal lineage. The Quran states: (30:21): ‚ÄúAnd among His signs is that He has created for you, from your selves, mates, that you may incline towards them and find rest in them, and He has engendered love and tenderness between you. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect.‚Äù ===Permissible age=== Sahih Muslim permits marriage once a person reaches sexual maturity (i.e.: menstruation, voice changing, wet dreams) (baligh). Sexual maturity in Sharia law is typically understood to mean puberty.Islam and the Everyday World: Public Policy Dilemmas Page 102, Sohrab Behdad, Farhad Nomani, Farhad Nomani 2006 At the same time, intercourse is forbidden until they are able to physically bear it.Requirement for Marriage ===Other religions=== Traditionally, Muslim jurists hold that Muslim women may only enter into marriage with Muslim men. The Qur'an explicitly allows Muslim men to marry chaste women of the People of the Book, a term which includes Jews and Christians. ===Arranged and forced marriages=== An engagement may be arranged between families for their children, but Islamic requirements for a legal marriage include the requirement that both parties, bride, groom and guardian for the bride (wali), give their legal consent. A marriage without the consent of the bride or performed under coercion is illegal according to the majority of scholars. If a girl has not attained the age of puberty, the vast majority of scholars hold that she cannot be married; and many stipulate that it must be in her best interest in order to be considered a valid marriage. There is some dispute as to whether or not an under-age bride can leave her family's custody and be transferred to her husband's custody, if she has not yet reached puberty. Some evidence supporting both sides can be seen in the following narrations from Muhammad: Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 62, Number 65 Narrated 'Aisha: that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old. Hisham said: I have been informed that 'Aisha remained with the Prophet for nine years (i.e. till his death). Sahih Bukhari 7.18 Narrated 'Ursa: The Prophet asked Abu Bakr for 'Aisha's hand in marriage. Abu Bakr said \\"But I am your brother.\\" The Prophet said, \\"You are my brother in Allah's religion and His Book, but she (Aisha) is lawful for me to marry.\\" However, evidence from other Islamic sources seems to suggest that this is not something allowed for all Muslims; rather specifically for Muhammad. The evidence for this view is as follows: Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet said: \\"A non-virgin woman may not be married without her command, and a virgin may not be married without her permission; and it is permission enough for her to remain silent (because of her natural shyness).\\" [Al-Bukhari:6455, Muslim & Others] It is reported in a hadith that A'ishah related that she once asked the Prophet: \\"In the case of a young girl whose parents marry her off, should her permission be sought or not?\\" He replied: \\"Yes, she must give her permission.\\" She then said: \\"But a virgin would be shy, O Messenger of Allaah!\\" He replied: \\"Her silence is [considered as] her permission.\\" [Al-Bukhari, Muslim, & Others] It appears that the permission of an under-age bride is indeed necessary for her marriage to be considered valid; the above narrations seem to clearly make the approval of the bride a condition for a valid marriage contract. ===Adulterers=== Islam does not give adulterous men the right to marry a chaste woman, nor may an adulterous woman marry a chaste man, except if the matter has not gone to court and the two purify themselves of this sin by sincere repentance., Javed Ahmed Ghamidi, Mizan, Chapter:The Social Law of Islam, Al-Mawrid ===Other=== A woman or man may propose marriage directly or through an intermediary (matchmaker). Recognition or celebration of same-sex marriage is completely unjustified in the view of Islamic law. Islam forbids homosexuality in Qur'anic injunctions and Islamic tradition. A marriage is registered by the Qadi who performs the short ceremony. Unlike the wedding ring in Western societies, there is no visible sign worn to show a woman or a man is married. However, some Muslims have found the wedding ring to be a non-religious tradition and have used a ring. ===Mahr=== Mahr is a mandatory gift given by the groom to the bride. Unlike a bride price, however, it is given directly to the bride and not to her father. Although the gift is often money, it can be anything agreed upon by bride and groom such as a house or viable business that is put in her name and can be run and owned entirely by her if she chooses. ===Islamic marriage contract=== A Muslim marriage is not a sacrament, but a simple, legal agreement in which either partner is free to include conditions. These conditions are stipulated in a written contract. Violating any of the conditions stipulated in this contract is legal grounds for a partner seeking divorce. The first part of the Nikah, \\"marriage ceremony\\", is the signing of the marriage contract itself. Various traditions may differ in how Nikah is performed because different groups accept different texts as authoritative. Therefore, Sunnis will likely accept the hadith of Muhammad al- Bukhari, while Shia will have their own collections, for example Furu al-Kafi, thus producing different procedures. This contract requires the consent of both parties. There is a tradition, outside of the religion, in some Muslim countries to pre-arrange a marriage for young children. However, the marriage still requires consent for the wedding to legally take place. Divorce is not forbidden as a last resort, but the dissolution of the contract Talaq, is often described as the most disliked of permissible things in Islam and should be used as a last resort. ==Walima== The Walima is a dinner given by the groom's side of the family to celebrate the welcoming of the bride to the family. It is a strong sunnah (the repetition of an action of Muhammad) and it is recommended to be held the earliest possible day after the Nikah. ==Behavior within marriage== ===Spousal rights and obligations=== Islam advocates a role-based relationship between husband and wife. \`Abd Allah ibn \`Umar narrated: It puts the main responsibility of earning over the husband. Both are obliged to fulfill the other's sexual needs. Both are obliged to treat each other with kindness. ====Separate accommodation for wife==== The wife has the right to live in separate accommodation with her husband and children, if she does not want to share it with anyone like her in-law or relatives. This is the view of most of the Hanafi, Shaafa‚Äôi and Hanbali fuqaha. She also has the right to refuse to live with her husband's father, mother and siblings. Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar: That he heard Allah's Apostle saying, \\"Everyone of you is a guardian and is responsible for his charge; the ruler is a guardian and is responsible for his subjects; the man is a guardian in his family and responsible for his charges; a woman is a guardian of her husband's house and responsible for her charges; and the servant is a guardian of his master's property and is responsible for his charge.\\" I definitely heard the above from the Prophet and think that the Prophet also said, \\"A man is a guardian of his father's property and responsible for his charges; so everyone of you is a guardian and responsible for his charges.\\" [Sahih Bukhari] This indicates that a wife is responsible for the house of her husband. Also that a man should be the guardian of his family, i.e., after his marriage he moves out of his father's house, and runs his own family affairs and is guardian of his family. In a joint family, typically the head is either the father of the husband, or mother of the husband. This also indicates that a husband should look after his parent's house, as \\"a man is a guardian of his father's property\\". So the wife should not object to her husband when he is looking after affairs of his parents.Rights of Spouses and issues with joint family ====Sexuality==== Sexuality in Islam is largely described by the Qur'an, Islamic tradition, and religious leaders both past and present as being confined to marital relationships between men and women. While most traditions discourage celibacy, all encourage strict chastity and modesty (see haya) with regards to any relationships across gender lines, holding forth that intimacy as perceived within Islam (encompassing a swath of life more broad than strictly sex) is to be reserved for marriage. Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud narrated: While adulterous relationships are strictly forbidden, permissible sexual relationships within marriage are described in Islamic sources as great wells of love and closeness for the couple involved. Sexual relationship between married couples are even source of rewards from God as doing the opposite, i.e., satisfying sexual needs through illicit means, has punishment. Specific occasions (most notably daytime fasting (see sawm) and menstruation) are times forbidden for intercourse, though not for other ways of touching and being close to one another. Anal sex with one's wife is also strictly prohibited. Islam has an open and playful approach to sex, Article titled ‚ÄúSex: What Muslim women really want in the bedroom‚Äù, by Shelina Janmohamed, The Telegraph, May 2, 2013, accessed on 23 September 2015., 100 Interesting Facts About ‚Ä¶ so long as it is within marriage, free of lewdness, fornication and adultery. ===Gender roles=== The Qur'an asserts that there are innate differences between women and men.\\"And the male is not like the female.\\" Therefore, Islam places different rights over the husband and wife. Some similar rights which both the husband and wife owe to each other are: * The right to enjoy each other. * The right to inherit from each other. * The right of confirmation of the lineage of their children. Some rights which the husband owes to his wife are: * The dower (Mahr) * Support * Kind and proper treatment * Marital relations * Privacy * Justice between multiple wives * To be taught her religion * Defense of her honor Some rights which the wife owes to her husband are: * Being head of the household * To be obeyed in all that is not disobedience to Allah * Marital relations * That she not allow anyone in the house of whom he disapproves * That she not leave the house without his permission * That she protect his property * To be thanked for his efforts * That she can only undertake a voluntary fast with his permission These are some of the rights which spouses owe one another.Rights of spousesSee Section 18 ==See also== *Beena a form of marriage used in pre-Islamic Arabia *Islamic views on slavery#Concubinage *Marriage and wedding customs in Islam *The Sermon for Necessities *Women in Islam ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Marriage in Islamic Law * E-Book: Marriage A Form of Ibada * E-Book: Wedding Customs and Non-Islamic Traditions * Rights of husband and wife, and issues with joint family system * The Etiquettes of Muslim Marriage * Islamic Philosophy of Marriage * VIDEO: British Man and French Woman talk about Becoming Muslims and how they got married. * VIDEO: A French Muslim Convert Talks about Hijab and Marriage * crescentlife.com's \\"Fundamentals of a happy marriage\\", a Muslim view of marriage structured around \\"21 F's\\", words beginning in F such as Faith, Forgiving, Forget, Forbearance, and so on.

Jaffe and Josh Lerner. Princeton University Press published the book in 2004. The authors of the book outline changes made to the patent system in the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s which they say has led to a situation in which patents have become extremely powerful economic weapons, and are being issued irresponsibly and at an unreasonable rate. The end result, the authors claim, is that American innovation is being stifled unintentionally as a result of a few simple bureaucratic changes (centralizing the appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and making patent application fees the primary source of revenue for the United States Patent and Trademark Office). The authors argue that the establishment of the CAFC has led to judicial \\"tunnel vision\\"; because the judges of the CAFC are only asked to rule on matters of intellectual property, they come to value the current patent system too highly, and tend to side disproportionately with patent-holders. The authors frame the current debate about patents in historical terms, citing both times when patents were freely granted as royal favors, such as the Elizabethan era in England, as well as times when patents were impossible to obtain, or in the case of the Netherlands in the 1830s, completely abolished. == References == * * == See also == * Sealed crustless sandwich Category:Works about intellectual property law Category:Works about patent law Category:Economics of intellectual property Category:2004 non- fiction books ","title":"Innovation and Its Discontents"},{"id":"1269885","text":"A lion-faced Chnuphis figure found on a Gnostic gem in Bernard de Montfaucon's L'antiquit√© expliqu√©e et repr√©sent√©e en figures, often associated with Yaldabaoth.

The majority of the Newfoundland Railway's operations were not economically self-sustaining, requiring significant subsidization; however, it was only after the construction of the Trans-Canada Highway across the island in the early 1960s that the railway began to see serious declines in traffic. At the same time, CN took over the Newfoundland Railway's ferry service between North Sydney, Nova Scotia and Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and promptly began to improve the service, bringing in vessels dedicated to carrying automobiles and trucks throughout the 1950s-1970s. By the early 1970s, CN faced increased scrutiny from federal politicians complaining about the railway's continuous losses. Successive federal governments of the period had frequently forced the company to undertake various endeavours in the national interest, often at the expense of business and economic logic. As a result, CN sought to restructure itself, placing many of these operations into separate subsidiaries to clarify the accounting behind their existence. Restructuring applied to operations which lost money and required subsidization, or which were not part of CN's core freight railway business. In 1977, all east coast ferries operated by CN were transferred to a new CN Subsidiary, CN Marine. Passenger rail services were transferred to the new Crown corporation, Via Rail, and in 1979, all of CN's freight railway operations on Newfoundland, along with the CN Roadcruiser Bus service and CN's trucking operation, were placed into a new division named Terra Transport. ==CN on Newfoundland== CN's operations on Newfoundland revolved around the former Newfoundland Railway, which was the longest narrow- gauge railway in North America, stretching approximately 1000 km across the island, from the ferry terminal in Port aux Basques to the provincial capital at St. John's. Many of the island's largest communities developed along the main line, largely because of their location; as a result, the Trans-Canada Highway paralleled its route in many places. Rail operations in Newfoundland remained economically unfeasible because of slow service times, a side effect of the narrow-gauge format. CN invested heavily in track improvements during the 1950s-1960s, but the narrow-gauge operation could not compete with the flexibility of trucks. Significant time was lost at Port aux Basques, where standard-gauge railway cars from mainland North America were lifted off their bogies and onto narrow-gauge bogies for use on Newfoundland. In some cases this was not possible, and the rail car contents were unloaded and reloaded onto narrow-gauge cars. CN's operation of dedicated railway car ferries was an additional expense. CN operated a main line passenger train, the Caribou, from St. John's to Port aux Basques. Nicknamed the Newfie Bullet, the Caribou operated until June 1969, when it was replaced by the CN Roadcruiser bus service started in the Fall of 1968. With the demise of the Caribou, the only passenger services remaining on the island were mixed freight and passenger trains on the Bonavista, Carbonear, and Argentia branch lines, and on the main-line between Bishop's Falls and Corner Brook. Terra Transport would continue to operate mixed passenger/freight service on the branch lines until 1984. The mainline service between Corner Brook and Bishop's Falls made its last run on 30 September 1988. The Roadcruiser bus service ran until 29 March 1996, when it was sold to DRL Coachlines of Triton, Newfoundland. The most significant change made under the Terra Transport subsidiary was the move to the carriage of less-than-carload (LCL) freight. A large fleet of distinctive green intermodal shipping containers were ordered and used in place of boxcars. These containers were stacked on flatcars of mainland trains, fitted onto the decks inside the ferries, and then placed on flatcars of trains in Newfoundland, or transported entirely by truck. During the mid-1980s, trains composed almost entirely of the distinctive TT containers were common. The handling time for freight dropped considerably, as containers could be easily removed from the trains in each community and the loading/unloading at Port aux Basques was significantly improved over standard freight cars. Another significant change the closure and abandonment all of CN's branch lines in the province by 1984, leaving only the main line operational. Despite these changes, Terra Transport was unable to turn a profit for CN and the federal government. Specialized ferries were still needed for carrying non-LCL railway cars, and by the mid-1980s were approaching the end of their operational life and required replacement. The election of a Conservative federal government brought about the elimination of subsidies for money-losing operations. In 1986, one of two remaining railcar ferries was sold off as the government converted CN Marine into Marine Atlantic, completely separating the rail and ferry services. Terra Transport operations were largely captive on Newfoundland and would specialize in handling import/export LCL and inter- island non-LCL freight. ==Abandonment== In 1987, the federal government deregulated the railway industry in Canada and CN promptly applied to abandon its Newfoundland operations under Terra Transport. The political firestorm which followed saw the federal and provincial governments negotiate a one-time payout of $800 million (CAD) from Ottawa to St. John's to fund highway improvements under the Trans-Canada Highway Program and the Regional Trunk Road Agreement. The agreements were signed in December 1987; however, continuing public outcry and legal challenges kept the railway operational for several months. On 20 June 1988, it was officially announced that the railway would cease operations as of 1 September 1988. Some freight trains still ran until late September, with the last scheduled run on 29 September 1988. The last scheduled passenger train ran on 30 September 1988, from Bishops Falls to Corner Brook. Following official abandonment, the railway operated salvage trains, dismantling track in remote locations; some salvage trains were still operating in the summer of 1990. Most of the track was removed and scrapped by November 1990. CN no longer has any operations in the Province of Newfoundland. In the fall of 1996 CN contracted out its intermodal trucking operation to Clarke Transport, which is now the local agent for CN. Since 1997, the old railbed has been reclaimed as the Newfoundland T'Railway Provincial Park. == External links == * Railway-Coastal Museum Category:1979 establishments in Newfoundland and Labrador Category:1988 disestablishments in Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Defunct Newfoundland and Labrador railways Category:Canadian National Railway subsidiaries Category:3 ft 6 in gauge railways in Canada Category:Narrow gauge railways in Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Former Crown corporations of Canada ","title":"Terra Transport"},{"id":"1269890","text":"Wood Street is a railway station on the Chingford branch of the Lea Valley lines, located in Upper Walthamstow in the London Borough of Waltham Forest, east London. It is down the line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between and . It has been operated by London Overground since 2015. It is also occasionally known as \\"Walthamstow Wood Street\\". The station is in Travelcard Zone 4. ==History== The station was opened in 1873 by the Great Eastern Railway. On 13 February 1919 there was an accident at Wood Street when a passenger train ran into an empty stock train. Five people were injured ‚Äì none seriously. The cause was a signal failure. In 1923 the Great Eastern Railway became part of the London and North Eastern Railway, which in turn was merged into British Railways Eastern Region following nationalisation in 1948. When construction of the London Underground's Victoria line was given parliamentary approval in 1955, the plan was to build the line past Walthamstow Central station to Wood Street, where the line would surface to terminate next to the British Railways station, on land previously used as a coal depot. Before construction work started, a decision was made in 1961 to omit the section beyond Walthamstow Central. The line was electrified in 1960, and electric services commenced on 12 November. At first Class 305 EMUs were used, but initial technical problems led to their replacement by Class 302 and Class 304 EMUs. The station had a goods depot, which closed on 6 May 1968. In April 1994 Railtrack took over responsibility for the operation of the infrastructure. Train services have been operated since then by West Anglia Great Northern, National Express East Anglia, Abellio Greater Anglia and, , by London Overground. ===Engine shed=== There was an engine shed located just north of Wood Street which was a sub-shed of Stratford TMD and was built in 1878. The engine shed was a two road affair with space for 6 tank locomotives ‚Äì there was also a short siding for coal wagons. An additional siding was added c1934. By the 1950s the staff complement was 36 drivers, 36 Firemen and six Passed Cleaners although recruitment for what was a hard dirty job became more difficult during that decade. On 1 January 1922 the allocation consisted of three GER Class M15 2-4-2Ts (later LNER Class F4), two GER Class C72 (later LNER Class J68) and eleven GER Class S56 (later LNER class J69) 0-6-0T engines. In later years the main allocation of the shed was tank engines for working suburban services to and from London Liverpool Street and from the 1920s the allocation was exclusively the LNE N7 0-6-2T locomotives. The shed was closed in 1960 when the line was electrified. ==Services== Trains are operated by London Overground. The typical off-peak weekday service pattern is: *4 trains per hour (tph) to London Liverpool Street; *4 tph to Chingford. ==Connections== London Buses routes 230 and W16 serve the station. ==References== ==External links== Category:Railway stations in the London Borough of Waltham Forest Category:Former Great Eastern Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1873 Category:Railway stations served by London Overground Category:Railway depots in London Category:Walthamstow Category:Unbuilt London Underground stations Category:Proposed London Underground stations ","title":"Wood Street railway station"},{"id":"1269895","text":"Coat of arms of the Gorchakov family Gorchakov, or Gortchakoff (), is a Russian princely family of Rurikid stock, descended from the Rurikid sovereigns of Peremyshl, Russia. ==Aleksey Gorchakov== The family first achieved prominence during the reign of Catherine II.

In 1820 he suppressed an insurrection in the Caucasus, for which service he was raised to the rank of major-general. In 1828‚Äì1829 he fought under Prince Peter von Wittgenstein against the Turks, won an action at Aidos, and signed the treaty of peace at Adrianople. In 1839 he was made governor of Eastern Siberia, and in 1851 retired into private life. When the Crimean War broke out he offered his services to the emperor Nicholas, by whom he was appointed general of the VI army corps in the Crimea. He commanded the corps in the battles of Alma and Inkerman. He retired in 1855 and died at Moscow, on March 18, 1868. ==Mikhail Gorchakov== Prince Mikhail Dmitrievich (1795‚Äì1861), brother of the last named, was appointed commander- in-chief of the Russian troops which occupied Moldavia and Wallachia after the outbreak of the Crimean War. In 1854 he crossed the Danube and besieged Silistria, but was superseded in April by Prince Ivan Paskevich, who, however, resigned on June 8, when Gorchakov resumed the command. In 1855 Gorchakov was appointed commander-in-chief of the Russian forces in the Crimea in place of the disgraced Prince Menshikov. Gorchakov's defence of Sevastopol, and final retreat to the northern part of the town, which he continued to defend till peace was signed in Paris, were conducted with lack of energy. In 1856 he was appointed governor-general of Poland in succession to Prince Paskevich. He died at Warsaw on May 30, 1861, and was buried, in accordance with his own wish, at Sevastopol. == Alexander Gorchakov == Prince Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov (1798‚Äì1883) served as Chancellor of the Russian Empire (in office from 1867) during the reign of Emperor Alexander II (). He was educated at the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum, where he had the poet Alexander Pushkin as a school- fellow. In 1820‚Äì22 he accompanied Foreign Minister Karl Nesselrode to the Holy Alliance congresses at Troppau, Laibach, and Vienna. Gorchakov was appointed Foreign Minister in April 1856 soon after the end of the Crimean War of 1853 to 1856; he represented the Russian Empire at the Paris Congress of 1856. His main objective was to restore Russia's international prestige after the bitter defeat. At first he steered the country towards an alliance with Napoleon III of France, but rebuffed by the latter's support of the January Uprising in Poland, joined his archrival Otto von Bismarck in setting up the League of the Three Emperors in 1873. Following France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871, Gorchakov succeeded in his long-term goal or revising the key clauses of the Paris Treaty, especially those containing Russia's interests in the Black Sea. The aged chancellor was so disgusted by the modification of the Treaty of San Stefano at the Berlin Congress of 1878 that in 1882 he laid down all his offices and settled into retirement. He died some months later. ==References== ==External links== * Gorchakov genealogy Gorchakov Category:Gorchakov family Category:Russian commanders of the Napoleonic Wars Gorchakov, Mikhail Category:Russian noble families ","title":"Gorchakov"},{"id":"1269900","text":"In mathematics, the Legendre chi function is a special function whose Taylor series is also a Dirichlet series, given by : \\\\chi_ u(z) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{z^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)^ u}.

Whereas the word economy suggests that people in a community possess a common and congruent set of values and goals, catallaxy suggests that the emergent properties of a market (prices, division of labor, growth, etc.) are the outgrowths of the diverse and disparate goals of the individuals in a community. Aristotle was the first person to define the word \\"economy\\" as ‚Äòthe art of household management‚Äô.Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1141b.32 As is still a common method of explanation today, Aristotle tried to explain complex market phenomena through an analogy between a household and a state, take for example the modern analogy between the national debt of a country's government and a simple consumer's credit card debt. Aristotle used a common Greek word 'oikonomia' that meant \\"to direct a single household,\\" and used it to mean the management of an entire city-state.Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1140b.10 The word catallaxy aims to provide a more accurate and inclusive word for the market phenomenon of groups of households, in which participants are free to pursue diverse ends of their own. After being discussed by Ludwig von Mises the term catallaxy was later made popular by Friedrich Hayek who defines it as \\"the order brought about by the mutual adjustment of many individual economies in a market\\".Hayek, F.

He was a professor emeritus at Claremont McKenna College and Claremont Graduate University and a distinguished fellow of the Claremont Institute. Robert P. Kraynak says his \\"life work was to develop an American application of Leo Strauss's revival of natural-right philosophy against the relativism and nihilism of our times.\\"Robert P. Kraynak, \\"HARRY V. JAFFA.\\" Review of Politics 77#2 (2015): 169-169. Jaffa wrote on topics ranging from Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas to Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill and natural law. He has been published in the Claremont Review of Books, the Review of Politics, National Review, and the New York Times. His most famous work, Crisis of the House Divided: An Interpretation of the Issues in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, written in 1959, has been described as \\"the greatest Lincoln book ever.\\" Jaffa was a formative influence on the American conservative movement, challenging notable conservative thinkers including Russell Kirk, Richard M. Weaver, and Willmoore Kendall on Abraham Lincoln and the founding of the United States. He debated Robert Bork on American constitutionalism. He died in 2015. ==Early life and education== Jaffa as a child, with his parents in the early 1920s Jaffa was born in New York City on October 7, 1918, to Arthur Solomon Jaffa and Frances Landau Jaffa; his middle name is a reference to World War I, which ended with the same year he was born. His family was Jewish. Note: this quote is from the authors' introductory essay, not from the interviews. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature from Yale University and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in political philosophy from The New School for Social Research. As a PhD student, he became interested in Abraham Lincoln after discovering a copy of the Lincoln‚ÄìDouglas debates in a used bookshop. Jaffa was one of Leo Strauss' first PhD students. His dissertation on Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas later became his first book, Thomism and Aristotelianism. There, he argues that the Christian beliefs of Aquinas influenced Aquinas' work on Aristotle. Alasdair MacIntyre describes the book as \\"an unduly neglected minor modern classic.\\" ==Career== Jaffa taught at Ohio State from 1951 through 1964, before moving to Claremont.http://ashbrook.org/wp- content/blogs.dir/1/files_mf/1402063193jaffa_070323_speech.mp3 ===Founding of the United States=== Jaffa believed the American founders, including Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington established the nation on political principles traceable from Locke to Aristotle. While he believed that governments are instituted to protect rights, he acknowledged the higher ends they serve, primarily happiness. The Declaration of Independence says Jaffa points out that safety and happiness are the principal virtues of Aristotelian political life in his Politics. Jaffa also points to Federalist No. 43, in which James Madison declares that safety and happiness are the aims of all political institutions, and George Washington's first inaugural address as cementing the link between human happiness and government and therefore the ancient roots of the American founding. ===Abraham Lincoln scholarship=== Jaffa has written two books dealing exclusively with Abraham Lincoln. His first, Crisis of the House Divided: An Interpretation of the Issues in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, was written in 1959. Forty years later, he followed it with A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War. Jaffa has also written a number of essays on Lincoln for the Claremont Institute, National Review, and other scholarly journals. Before Jaffa, most conservative scholars, including M. E. Bradford, Russell Kirk, and Willmoore Kendall believed that Lincoln's presidency represented a substantial growth in federal power and limitation on individual rights. Jaffa also believes that the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution share a relationship whereby the latter is intended to preserve the principles of the former. This belief has garnered criticism from legal scholars, particularly Robert Bork. ====Crisis of the House Divided==== Crisis of the House Divided, by Harry V. Jaffa In Crisis of the House Divided, Jaffa discusses the Lincoln‚ÄìDouglas debates that occurred on the eve of the American Civil War. During the 1850s, concern over the spread of slavery into the territories and into the free states became the primary concern of American politics. Stephen A. Douglas proposed the doctrine of popular sovereignty, which removed congressional authority over slavery's expansion into the territories and allowed the citizens of each territory to decide whether or not slavery would be legal there. In contrast, Lincoln believed that popular sovereignty was another example of tyranny of the majority. Lincoln argued that a majority could not sanction the enslavement of other men due to the Founding principle that \\"All men are created equal,\\" which slavery violated. Both men squared off in a contest for Illinois' Senate seat in 1858. In the book, Jaffa explains the philosophical underpinnings of both Lincoln and Douglas' arguments. According to Catherine H. Zuckert, Jaffa \\"aimed at nothing less than bringing to bear on America the methods and substance of the Straussian revival of the Socratic tradition of political philosophy.\\" Like Strauss, Jaffa observed the tendency of modernity to degenerate moral and political philosophy, which he found in Douglas' appeal to popular sovereignty. Jaffa also believed that Lincoln challenged Douglas' argument with an Aristotelian or classical philosophical position derived from the Declaration of Independence and its contention that \\"all men are created equal.\\" ====A New Birth of Freedom==== A New Birth of Freedom was to be the first of a projected two-volume commentary on the Gettysburg Address. The first volume focuses on Lincoln's First Inaugural Address and his July 4, 1861, address to Congress. Jaffa argues that the Gettysburg Address is not a self-contained work but \\"a speech within a drama. It can no more be interpreted apart from the drama than, let us say, a speech by Hamlet or MacBeth can be interpreted apart from Hamlet or MacBeth. The Gettysburg Address is a speech within the tragedy of the Civil War, even as Lincoln is its tragic hero. The Civil War is itself an outcome of tragic flaws‚Äîbirthmarks, so to speak‚Äîof the infant nation.\\" Jaffa describes human equality as America's \\"ancient faith\\" and contends that the Declaration of Independence reflects the principles of natural law. According to Jaffa, Lincoln's task was to restore America's political faith, saving the Union from the historicism of the Confederacy. Jaffa considers the political philosophy of John C. Calhoun the backbone of the Confederacy's new constitution and its notion of human inequality. According to him, Calhoun believed that equality was only a prescriptive attribute on the part of the states, not a natural right of human persons. By extension, Calhoun believes that human equality is derived from the relationship between equal states and not equal persons. Jaffa therefore believes that Calhoun's understanding of equality differs greatly from the American founders. ===Debating Lincoln=== Jaffa has debated many conservative and libertarian critics of Abraham Lincoln. In the mid-1960s, he argued for Lincoln's conservative legacy in the pages of The National Review with Frank Meyer, who maintained that Lincoln opened the door to unlimited expansion of federal power. In his book, Storm Over the Constitution (1999), he formulated a theory of constitutional law, incorporating the Declaration of Independence. The theory was criticized for being overly philosophical, rather than legal, despite being presented as a legal argument. His approach was especially critical of figures such as William Rehnquist and Robert Bork, who responded to Jaffa in The National Review. Jaffa has also criticized the scholarship of other prominent conservatives including Russell Kirk, Richard Weaver, M.E. Bradford, and Willmoore Kendall. Most recently, Jaffa debated libertarian author Thomas DiLorenzo. ====Debate with Thomas DiLorenzo==== Jaffa and Thomas DiLorenzo debated each other on May 7, 2002 in an event hosted by the Independent Institute. Each man made a statement followed by a rebuttal by the other, ending with questions and answers from the audience. Jaffa's argument was divided into four sections: * The South Was a Closed Society: For the 1860 Presidential Election, in 10 of the 11 states that became the Confederate States, Lincoln was not on the ballot, denying him at least the 100,000 votes of those who later went north to join the Union Army, possibly more. Jaffa points out that in the Cooper Union Address, Lincoln concluded that the South would be satisfied only if all anti-slavery sentiment was removed from the state constitutions in the eight free states that had laws preventing free blacks from being kidnapped as slaves. The man accused of being a slave could summon no witnesses, and had no counsel. Jaffa said that \\"if the federal commissioner decided he was a slave, he [the commissioner] was paid $10, and if he decided he was a free man, he was paid $5. It's hard to imagine any law passed in either Nazi Germany or Stalin's Russia that was more inconsistent with the principles of civil liberty than the Fugitive Slave Act.\\" * The Right of Secession Is Not the Right of Revolution: Jaffa distinguished revolution from secession. Revolution, he argues, is explained under the Declaration of Independence. It states, \\"Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends [the security of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness], the people have a right to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government [such] as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.\\" In contrast, the Confederacy claimed the right of secession, as the Confederacy believed that such a right existed under the Constitution. Jaffa argues that the Confederacy claimed secession instead of revolution because its rights were not being violated by the federal government. However, he also notes that the states that ratified the Constitution also agreed to adhere to the results of all elections and that by seceding from the Union, the Confederacy violated this basic promise. * Prelude to Southern Secession: Jaffa believed that the initial act of secession took place at the 1860 Democratic Convention. According to him, the seven states of the Deep South, the same seven states that seceded after Lincoln's election and before his inauguration, demanded as a plank in the Democratic platform, without which they would not support Douglas, a slave code for the territories. When the Convention refused to grant this demand, the delegates of the seven states left the Convention. In this section of the debate, Jaffa points out that slavery was aggressively expanding with the repeal of the Missouri Compromise by the Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act. Also, the Dred Scott case allowed slave owners to take slaves into the territories and demand Federal government protection for slavery in those areas. Jaffa claims that this was one of the largest expansions of federal power. * The Lincoln‚ÄìDouglas Debates: Jaffa argued that Douglas accepted the Dred Scott decision. There, Chief Justice Taney said that the right to own slaves is expressly affirmed in the Constitution. However, Lincoln said in the debates that it was implied but not expressly affirmed. Lincoln said to Douglas that by accepting Taney's opinion that slavery is expressly affirmed in the Constitution, one is under an obligation to give the slave owners the implementation of this right. The possibilities for the expansion of slavery were almost endless, according to Jaffa. Because Douglas would not subscribe to the slave code, the South left the party, which was enough to elect Abraham Lincoln. ===Criticism of Robert Bork=== Jaffa argues that former Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork advances a theory of American constitutionalism that is in fundamental tension with the principles of the Declaration of Independence. According to him, Bork believes that the Constitution and the Declaration are separate documents that were never intended to inform one another. Jaffa argues that Bork's argument represents legal positivism and moral relativism akin to that expressed by John C. Calhoun and the Confederacy during the Civil War. ===National Review=== Jaffa was close friends with William F. Buckley, publishing a number of articles on Lincoln in National Review throughout his career. He credits Buckley with allowing him to publish when he had been blacklisted by liberal journals and neoconservative publications after a dispute with Irving Kristol. However, Jaffa disagreed with many of the writers then publishing for the magazine including Russell Kirk and Frank Meyer. According to him, these men and other writers there rejected the principles of the Declaration of Independence and its main contention that \\"all men are created equal.\\" Jaffa has spent his lifetime stressing the importance of the Declaration to conservatives and liberals alike. ===Barry Goldwater campaign=== During the 1964 presidential campaign, Jaffa, who was serving as a speechwriter to Republican candidate Barry Goldwater, penned the line, \\"Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice, and moderation in the pursuit of justice is not a virtue\\" in his acceptance speech for the Republican presidential nomination. Although Goldwater claimed repeatedly that the line originated in a speech by Cicero, it appears nowhere in Cicero's works, and was in fact authored by Jaffa. ==Death== Jaffa died at Pomona Valley Hospital on January 10, 2015, the same day as his fellow Straussian and rival Walter Berns. ==Personal life== Jaffa married Marjorie Etta Butler in 1942; she died in 2010. ==Bibliography== ===Books=== * Thomism and Aristotelianism, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1952). * Crisis of the House Divided: An Interpretation of the Issues in the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1959). * How to Think about the American Revolution: A Bicentennial Cerebration (Carolina Academic Press, 1978). * Original Intent & the Framers of the Constitution, (Washington, D.C.: Regnery Publishing, Inc., 1994). * Shakespeare's Politics, ed. by Harry V.

The theory was first proposed by two authors working independently: Hans KuhnHans Kuhn, Rolf Hachmann and Georg Kossack, V√∂lker zwischen Germanen und Kelten. Schriftquellen, Bodenfunde und Namengute zur Geschichte des n√∂rdlichen Westdeutschlands um Christi Geburt, Neum√ºnster, Karl Wachholz, 1962. (German) and Maurits Gysseling, whose proposal included research indicating that another language may have existed somewhere in between Germanic and Celtic in the Belgian region.J.B. Berns (2004) Gysseling, M. Biography. (Dutch) The term Nordwestblock itself was coined by Hans Kuhn,Rolf Hachmann, Georg Kossack and Hans Kuhn. V√∂lker zwischen Germanen und Kelten, 1986, p. 183-212 who considered the inhabitants of the area neither Germanic nor Celtic and so attributed it to the people a distinct ethnicity or culture up to the Iron Age. == Language hypotheses == Concerning the language spoken by the Iron Age Nordwestblock population, Kuhn speculated on linguistic affinity to the Venetic language, other hypotheses connect the Northwestblock with the Raetic (\\"Tyrsenian\\") or generic Centum Indo-European (Illyrian, \\"Old European\\"). Gysseling suspected an intermediate Belgian language between Germanic and Celtic, that might have been affiliated to Italic. According to Luc van Durme, a Belgian linguist, toponymic evidence to a former Celtic presence in the Low Countries is nearly utterly absent.Oude taaltoestanden in en om de Nederlanden. Een reconstructie met de inzichten van M. Gysseling als leidraad. In: Handelingen van de Koninklijke commissie voor Toponymie en Dialectologie. LXXV/2003 Kuhn noted that since Proto-Indo-European (PIE), /b/ was very rare, and since that PIE /b/, via Grimm's law, is the main source of regularly inherited /p/ in words in Germanic languages (except after fricatives such as *sp-), the many words with /p/ occurring must have some other language as source. Similarly, in Celtic, PIE /p/ disappeared and in regularly-inherited words did not reappear in p-Celtic languages except as a result of proto- Celtic *k ∑ becoming *p. All that taken together means that any word starting with a /p/ in a Germanic language that is not evidently borrowed from either Latin or a p-Celtic language, such as Gaulish, must be a loan from another language. Kuhn ascribes those words to the Nordwestblock language. Linguist Peter Schrijver speculates on the reminiscent lexical and typological features of the region from an unknown substrate whose linguistic influences may have influenced the historical development of the (Romance and Germanic) languages of the region. He assumes the pre-existence of pre-Indo-European languages linked to the archeological Linear Pottery culture and to a family of languages featuring complex verbs, of which the Northwest Caucasian languages might have been the sole survivors. Although assumed to have left traces within all other Indo-European languages as well, its influence would have been especially strong on Celtic languages originating north of the Alps and on the region including Belgium and the Rhineland.Peter Schrijver. Keltisch en de buren: 9000 jaar taalcontact, University of Utrecht, March 2007. It is uncertain when Germanic began to gain a foothold in the area. The Nordwestblock region north of the Rhine is traditionally conceived as belonging to the realms of the Northern Bronze Age, with the Harpstedt Iron Age generally assumed to represent the Germanic precedents west of the Jastorf culture.J.P. Mallory, In Search of the Indo-Europeans, p. 87 The general development converged with the emergence of Germanic within other previously Northern Bronze Age regions to the east, maybe also involving a certain degree of Germanic cultural diffusion. The local continuity of the Frisian areas was not substantially affected by pre-Roman or Celtic immigration.Op zoek naar de Kelten, Nieuwe archeologische ontdekkingen tussen Noordzee en Rijn. Leo Verhart, 2007. From about the 1st century CE, that region saw the development of the \\"Weser-Rhine\\" group of West Germanic dialects which gave rise to Old Frankish from the 4th century. The issue still remains unresolved and so far no conclusive evidence has been forwarded to support any alternative. Mallory considers the issue a salutary reminder that some anonymous linguistic groups that do not fully obey the current classification may have survived to the beginning of historical records. == Prehistoric composition == The archaeological case for the Nordwestgroup hypothesis makes reference to a time as early as 3000 BCE. The following prehistoric cultures have been attributed to the region and are compatible with but do not necessarily prove the Nordwestblock hypothesis. The Bell Beaker culture (2700‚Äì2100 BCE) is thought to originate from the same geographic area, as early stages of the culture apparently derived from early Corded Ware culture elements, with the Netherlands/Rhineland region as probably the most widely accepted site of origin (J. P. Mallory, EIEC p. 53).thumb200pxEuropean early Iron Age cultures: The Bell Beaker culture locally developed into the Bronze Age Barbed Wire Beaker culture (2100‚Äì1800 BCE). In the 2nd millennium BCE, the region was at the boundary between the Atlantic and Nordic horizons, split up in a northern and a southern region, roughly divided by the course of the Rhine. To the north emerged the Elp culture (1800-800 BCE), featuring an initial tumulus phase showing a close relationship to other Northern European tumulus groups (sharing pottery of low quality: K√ºmmerkeramik) and a subsequent smooth local transformation to the Urnfield culture (1200‚Äì800 BCE). The southern region became dominated by the Hilversum culture (1800‚Äì800 BCE), which apparently inherited the previous Barbed Wire Beaker cultural ties with Britain. From 800 BCE onward, the area was influenced by the Celtic Hallstatt culture. The current view in the Netherlands holds that subsequent Iron Age innovations did not involve substantial Celtic intrusions but featured a local development from Bronze Age culture.Leo Verhart. Op Zoek naar de Kelten, Nieuwe archeologische ontdekkingen tussen Noordzee en Rijn, 2006, p67. . In the final centuries BCE, areas formerly occupied by the Elp culture emerge as the probably-Germanic Harpstedt culture west of the Germanic Jastorf culture, and the southern parts become assimilated to the Celtic La T√®ne culture, as is consistent with Julius Caesar's account of the Rhine forming the boundary between Celtic and Germanic tribes. Later, the Roman retreat resulted in the disappearance of imported products like ceramics and coins and a return to virtually-unchanged local Iron Age production methods. To the north, people continued to live in the same three-aisled farmhouse, and to the east, completely-new types of buildings arose. More to the south, in Belgium, archaeological results of the period point to immigration from the north.J. H. F. Bloemers & T. van Dorp. Pre-en Protohistorie van de Lage Landen. De Haan/Open Universiteit, 1991, pp. 329‚Äì338, , NUGI 644. == Roman era == With the onset of historical records (Tacitus, 1st century), the area was generally called the border region between Celtic (Gaulish) and Germanic influence. Tribes located in the area include the Batavians, Belgae, Chatti, Hermunduri, Cheruscii, Salii, Sicambri, Tencteri and Usipetes or Usipii. Caesar took the course of the Rhine to be the boundary between Gauls and Germans (Germanic people) but also mentioned that a large part of the Belgae had ancestry from east of the Rhine and that one part were even known collectively as \\"Germani\\" (the so-called \\"Germani cisrhenani\\"). The Belgae were therefore considered Gaulish (the Usipetes Germanic etc.) because of their position with respect to the Rhine, and not in the modern linguistic sense of the terms. Some of those tribes would later join the Frankish confederation. == See also == * Ambrones * Archaeology of Northern Europe * Dutch mythology * Germanic substrate hypothesis * Old Europe (archaeology) == References == * Hans Kuhn, Vor- und fr√ºhgermanische Ortsnamen in Nord-Deutschland und in den Niederlanden, Westf√§lische Forschungen 12, pp. 5 ‚Äì 44, 1959.

From 2004 until 2008 he was president of the Coalition of the Left of Movements and Ecology, commonly known as Synaspismos. He was parliamentary leader of the wider Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA). ==Biography== ===Early life=== Born on 22 May 1950 in Athens, Alavanos has been politically active since his youth. During the military dictatorship of 1967-1974, Alavanos participated in the student movement against the regime; as a result his military service deferment was revoked and he was briefly incarcerated in the EAT/ESA military prison. ===Political career=== He was elected to the European Parliament in 1981 with the Communist Party of Greece and again in 1989, 1994 and 1999 with Synaspismos. In the 2004 Greek legislative election, Alavanos was elected MP in Athens. Since Nikos Konstantopoulos, his predecessor in Synaspismos' leadership, announced his intention not to be a candidate for another term, Alavanos announced his own candidacy for the office. The party congress elected him president on 12 December 2004. In the 2007 Greek legislative election, running as leader of SYRIZA, which more than doubled its parliamentary seats, he was narrowly elected an MP in Heraklion, Crete. On 27 November 2007, Alavanos announced that he would not apply for a renewal of his presidency of Synaspismos at its 5th party congress in February 2008, due to private reasons.Synaspismos press release He was replaced by Alexis Tsipras. In February 2011 he left Synaspismos and founded the Front of Solidarity and Overthrow with other former members of Coalition of the Radical Left. Communist Organization of Greece, Internationalist Workers' Left, Movement for the United in Action Left and Anticapitalist Political Group joined the front, but they left it in 2012 due to political disputes. He again founded a new political party in 2013, founding Plan B specifically to contest the 2014 European Parliament election in Greece. The party's platform is centered on exiting Greece from the eurozone. ===Personal life=== Alekos Alavanos is an economist.

BR-277, as well as BRs 369 and 376, which form a triangle within the state of Paran√°, were granted to private companies in 1997, at the beginning of the era of road concessions in Brazil. The contracts are valid until 2021. Initially, 995 km of roads in Paran√° should be duplicated, and the population was promised that the State would have First World highways, strongly boosting economic growth. But additions were soon signed that removed duplications and other works from the contracts. The duplication commitment fell from 995 to 616 km. To make matters worse, in 2019, what had been doubled was no more than 300 km, even with toll rates rising every year. The MPF (Federal Public Ministry) then carried out Operation Integration, which showed that the changes made to the contracts are part of a millionaire kickback scheme. The companies paid at least R $ 35 million in fees to achieve these changes in contracts. The estimated diversion of money in the toll system amounts to R $ 8.4 billion. Some of those cited by the MPF to receive these fees are: Jaime Lerner, Roberto Requi√£o and Beto Richa, all former governors of the State of Paran√°, and the concessionaires Rodonorte, Econorte, Ecovia, Ecocataratas, Caminhos do Paran√° and Viapar.

The German Christians, an antisemitic and racist pressure group and Kirchenpartei,A Kirchenpartei (church party) in German Protestantism is a group nominating candidates in a list for church elections and compares roughly to nominating groups in the Church of Sweden. gained enough power on boards of the member churches to be able to install Ludwig M√ºller to the office of Reichsbischof in the 1933 church elections. The German Evangelical Church Confederation was subsequently renamed the German Evangelical Church. In 1934, the German Evangelical Church suffered controversies and internal struggles which left member churches either detached or reorganised into German Christians-led dioceses of what was to become a single, unified Reich Church compatible with Nazi ideology for all of Nazi Germany. In 1935, in wake of controversies and church struggles, the Ministry for Church Affairs removed Ludwig M√ºller and installed a committee headed by Wilhelm Zoellner to lead the confederation. As a result, the German Evangelical Church regained partial support as some of member churches that left rejoined. In 1936, the Zoellner committee denounced German Christians and increasingly leaned towards the Confessing Church and its positions. In 1937, the Nazis removed the Zoellner committee and reinstalled German Christians into the leading position. In 1937-1945, the German Evangelical Church was controlled by German Christians and the Ministry. It was no longer considered a subject to the Kirchenkampf (struggle of the churches) to Adolf Hitler. It officially disbanded in 1945. It was succeeded by the Evangelical Church in Germany in 1948. ==Name== It is also known in English as the Protestant Reich Church () and colloquially as the Reich Church (). ==Overview== In 1933, the German Christians took leadership in some member churches of the German Evangelical Church Confederation. A new designation was voted on and adopted, with the organisation now being called the German Evangelical Church. In its early stages, it remained a loose confederation of churches just like its predecessor. It included a vast majority of Protestants in what was now Nazi Germany, excluding those affiliated with the free churches like the Evangelical Lutheran Free Church. In a 1933 voting to the Reichssynode, the German Christians were able to elect Ludwig M√ºller, a pro-Nazi pastor, to the office of Reichsbischof (\\"Reich Bishop\\").Schneider, Thomas M. Reichsbischof Ludwig M√ºller: eine Untersuchung zu Leben und Pers√∂nlichkeit. (=Arbeiten zur kirchlichen Zeitgeschichte, Series B: Darstellungen; 19.) (384 pp) G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1993 On December 20, 1933, M√ºller merged the church's Protestant Youth organisations into the Hitler Jugend without consulting their leadership or any member churches. Many in the German Evangelical Church resisted this idea and a discussion began. M√ºller tried to silence it by introducing discipline and using powers of the elected office. His attempts failed, prompting Adolf Hitler to meet with Protestant leaders on January 25, 1934. Although the meeting ended with Protestant churches declaring their loyalty to the state, removing M√ºller was not a subject to discussion for Hitler. After that, member churches began to either reorganise or detach from the German Evangelical Church. Initially, there was little resistance to the attempt to introduce elements of Nazi ideology into church doctrine. Most of the resistance came from confessing communities (bekennende Gemeinden) within \\"intact\\" and \\"destroyed churches\\" (see below) and the Pfarrernotbund (Emergency Covenant of Pastors) led by pastor Martin Niem√∂ller. In consequence of the 1934 meeting, many member churches distanced themselves from the increasingly Nazi-controlled Reich Church due to controversies pertaining to its constitution, the nazification of its theology, leadership, incorporation of its Youth organisations into the Hitler Jugend, etc. Such churches became neutral or followed the Protestant opposition to Nazism that established an alternative umbrella organisation of their own that became known as the Confessing Church. \\"Unification, World Wars, and Nazism\\" The Reich Church ultimately ended up being a confederation of those German Protestant churches that espoused a single doctrine named Positive Christianity, which was compatible with Nazism. Although it aimed to eventually become a unified Protestant state church for all of Nazi Germany, this attempt utterly failed as the German Evangelical Church became fractured into various groups that bore an unclear legal status in relation to each other: *churches with a German Christians-dominated governing board reorganising them into dioceses of the Reich Church led by German Christians (\\"dioceses of the German Evangelical Church\\" [Bist√ºmer der Deutschen Evangelischen Kirche] in official usage, or \\"destroyed churches\\" [zerst√∂rte Kirchen] in the parlance of the Confessing Church) *churches with a governing board without a German Christian majority merging them as members of the Reich Church, but rejected M√ºller as its leader (the Churches of Bavaria, of Hanover, of Westphalia, and of W√ºrttemberg) (\\"intact churches\\" [intakte Kirchen] in Confessing Church parlance) *the Confessing Church that saw itself as the true Protestant church for all of Germany, provided resistance to the German Christians-led German Evangelical Church and to its so-called dioceses (\\"destroyed churches\\"), and acted on principles of the \\"1934 church emergency law of Dahlem\\" that deemed the constitution of the German Evangelical Church \\"shattered\\" (the \\"Confessing Church\\", Bekennende Kirche) M√ºller's influence declined after more constant clashes in the German Evangelical Church, triggering the foundation of the Ministry for Church Affairs led by Hans Kerrl on July 16, 1935. A decree issued by Kerrl in September 1935, appointed a committee led by Wilhelm Zoellner (Church of Westphalia) to head the Reich Church instead of M√ºller. It was received positively by intact churches and even confessing parts of the German Evangelical Church. In 1936, the committee denounced the teachings of the German Christians-controlled Church of Thuringia, and the regime feared that the Confessing Church would gain more support due to this. In February 1937, the committee was removed by the Nazis and leading figures of the Protestant resistance like Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Martin Niem√∂ller and others were arrested. In 1939, M√ºller tried to regain his position in the German Evangelical Church but failed to do so. After 1937, the German Evangelical Church was not considered an issue in the Kirchenkampf by the Nazis as it became heavily controlled by the Ministry until 1945. In August 1945, the German Evangelical Church was officially dissolved by the council of the newly founded Protestant umbrella organisation called the Evangelical Church in Germany. ==Beginnings, German Christians and Nazi influence (1933-1934)== Under the Weimar Republic, the system of state churches disappeared with the German monarchies. At this point, the unification of the Protestant churches into a single organisation seemed like a possibility, albeit a remote one. Since unification, clergy and ecclesiastical administrators had discussed a merger, but one had never materialised due to strong regional self-confidence and traditions as well as the denominational fragmentation of Lutheran, Calvinist and United churches. In 1920, Swiss Protestant churches came together in the Schweizerischer Evangelischer Kirchenbund (SEK). Following their example, the then 28 territorially defined German Protestant churches founded the Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchenbund (DEK) in 1922. This was not a merger into a single church but a loose federation of independent ones. The founding of the German Evangelical Church was the result of work by the Kirchenpartei of the German Christians who had gained a large majority at the 1933 church elections.The 1933 German Protestant Church Elections: Machtpolitik or Accommodation? by Shelley Baranowski. Church History, Vol. 49, No. 3 (Sep., 1980), pp. 298-315\\\\. Cambridge University Press on behalf of the American Society of Church History. In September 1934, the merger finally failed when the synods of two of the 28 churches, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria right of the river Rhine, the portion of Bavaria which forms today's Free State (without the Palatinate left of the Rhine), and the Evangelical State Church in W√ºrttemberg, refused to dissolve their church bodies as independent entities, and the Berlin-based Landgericht I court restored the largest church body, the by then already merged Evangelical Church of the Old-Prussian Union by its resolution in November the same year, thus resuming independence. Consequently, the German Evangelical Church, created as a merger, then continued to exist as a mere umbrella. ==Controversies, internal struggles and conflict with the Confessing Church (1934-1937)== Some Protestant functionaries and laymen opposed the unification. Many more agreed but wanted it under Protestant principles, not imposed by Nazi partisans. The Protestant opposition had organised first among pastors by way of the Emergency Covenant of Pastors and then--including laymen --developed into grassroots meetings establishing independent synods by January 1934. At the first Reich's Synod of Confession (erste Reichsbekenntnissynode) held in Wuppertal-Barmen between 29‚Äì31 May 1934, it called itself the Confessing Church. On July 16, 1935, Hanns Kerrl was appointed Reichsminister for Church Affairs, a newly created department.Barbara Kr√ºger and Peter Noss, \\"Die Strukturen in der Evangelischen Kirche 1933-1945\\", in: Kirchenkampf in Berlin 1932-1945: 42 Stadtgeschichten, Olaf K√ºhl-Freudenstein, Peter Noss, and Claus Wagener (eds.), Berlin: Institut Kirche und Judentum, 1999, (Studien zu Kirche und Judentum; vol. 18), pp. 149‚Äì171, here p. 160. He started negotiations to find a compromise and dropped the extreme German Christians, trying to win moderate Confessing Christians and respected neutrals. On September 24, 1935, a new law empowered Kerrl to legislate by way of ordinances within the German Evangelical Church, circumventing any synodal autonomy.The law was euphemistically called Act on Safeguarding the German Evangelical Church (, or colloquially Sicherungsesetz. Cf. Kr√ºger and Noss, pp. 149-171, here p. 161. Kerrl managed to gain the very respected Wilhelm Zoellner (a Lutheran, until 1931 General Superintendent of the old-Prussian ecclesiastical province of Westphalia) to form the Reich's Ecclesiastical Committee (Reichskirchenausschuss, RKA) on October 3, 1935, combining the neutral and moderate groups to reconcile the disputing church parties. The official German Evangelical Church became subordinate to the new bureaucracy, and M√ºller lost power but still retained the now meaningless titles of German Reich's Bishop and old-Prussian State Bishop. In November, Kerrl decreed the parallel institutions of the Confessing Church were to be dissolved, a move which was protested and ignored by Confessing Church leaders. On December 19, Kerrl issued a decree which forbade all kinds of Confessing Church activities, namely appointments of pastors, education, examinations, ordinations, ecclesiastical visitations, announcements and declarations from the pulpit, separate financial structures and convening Synods of Confession; further the decree established provincial ecclesiastical committees.Kr√ºger and Noss, pp. 149‚Äì171, here p. 161. Thus, the brethren councils had to go into hiding, and Kerrl successfully wedged the Confessing Church. The Gestapo increased its suppression, undermining the readiness for compromises among the Confessing Church. Zoellner concluded that this made his reconciliatory work impossible and criticised the Gestapo activities. He resigned on February 2, 1937, paralysing the Ecclesiastical Committee which lost all recognition among the opposition.Kr√ºger and Noss, pp. 149‚Äì171, here p. 163. Kerrl now subjected M√ºller's chancery of the German Evangelical Church directly to his ministry and the national, provincial and state ecclesiastical committees were soon after dissolved.Kr√ºger and Noss, pp. 149‚Äì171, here p. 164. ==German Christian takeover until dissolution (1937-1945)== Although the church was initially supported by the regime, the Nazis eventually lost interest in the experiment after it failed to supplant or absorb traditional Protestant churches. After 1937, relations between the Reich Church and the Nazi government began to sour. On November 19, 1938, as reported on in the Ludington Daily News, YHWH was ordered to be erased from Protestant churches within the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union by Friedrich Werner, the president of its executive board (Evangelical Supreme Church Council; EOK). His order said the name of the 'God of Israel' (which contemporarily has Judaic connotations) must be obliterated wherever it was displayed in Protestant churches. On September 1, 1939, Kerrl decreed the separation of the ecclesiastical and the administrative governance within the official Evangelical Church. The German Christian Friedrich Werner, president of EOK, won over August Marahrens, State Bishop of the \\"intact\\" Church of Hanover, and the theologians Walther Schultz, a German Christian, and Friedrich Hymmen, vice president of the Old-Prussian Evangelical Supreme Church Council, to form an Ecclesiastical Council of Confidence (Geistlicher Vertrauensrat). This council exercised ecclesiastical leadership for the church from early 1940 and afterwards.Kr√ºger, Barbara & Noss, Peter (1999) \\"Die Strukturen in der Evangelischen Kirche 1933-1945\\", in: K√ºhl-Freudenstein, Olaf, et al.

As to co-operation between the Protestant churches in Germany, strong resentments prevailed, especially among the Lutheran church bodies of Bavaria right of the river Rhine, the Hamburgian State, Hanover, Mecklenburg, Saxony, and Thuringia, against any unification after the experiences during Nazi rule. It was decided to replace the former German Federation of Protestant Churches with the new umbrella Evangelical Church in Germany, provisionally led by the Council of the Evangelical Church in Germany, a naming borrowed from the Reich's brethren council organisation. ==Reichsbisch√∂fe== * Friedrich von Bodelschwingh (1933) * Ludwig M√ºller (1933-1945) ==See also== * Kirchenkampf * Religious views of Adolf Hitler * Hitler's Table Talk * Religion in Nazi Germany * Confessing Church * Karl Fezer ==References== Notes Bibliography * Baranski, Shelley. \\"The 1933 German Protestant Church Elections: Machtpolitik or Accommodation?\\".

John Wyer (11 December 1909 in Kidderminster, England ‚Äì 8 April 1989 in Scottsdale, Arizona, United States), was an English automobile racing engineer and team manager. He is mainly associated with cars running in the light blue and orange livery of his longtime sponsor Gulf Oil. ==Biography== As team manager and team owner, Wyer won the 24 Hours of Le Mans several times. His first victory came in the 1959 edition, in his tenth anniversary as Aston Martin team manager, along with Roy Salvadori and Carroll Shelby, win with the DBR1. The team made their base for Le Mans at the Hotel De France from 1953 - 1975. The race cars would be tended within the courtyard and garage adjacent to the hotel before being driven to and from the circuit on the road for practice, qualifying and the race. The team also won the 1000 km N√ºrburgring over three consecutive years. In 1963 he left Aston Martin for Ford Advanced Vehicles (FAV) In 1964. After dismal results with the GT40s in their first two years, mainly dealing with reliability due to mechanical failure, the Ford GT40 programme was handed over to Holman Moody and Carroll Shelby to compete against Ferrari, with the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans victory being the most famous, as well as 1967. Ford closed FAV after the 1966 season, and John Wyer and John Willment formed J.W. Automotive Engineering Ltd (JWA) to take over the Slough factory and continued to build production GT40s on Ford's behalf. As Wyer was the well known team manager and present at race tracks, it was assumed that JW stands for John Wyer even though it is for John Willment, as stated by Willment's brother-in-law Hans Herrmann. With backing from Gulf Oil and their team manager J-O Bockman, Wyer created the Ford- powered Mirage M-1, a prototype that won the 1967 1000 km Spa. Due to a rule change that came in effect for 1968, prototypes were limited to 3,000 cc, while sportscars could have 5,000 cc if at least 50 were built. This applied to the two-year-old Ford GT40s, which were modified by Wyer. As a surprise, Wyer won the World Sportscar Championship for Ford in 1968 even though the 2,200 cc Porsche 907 were considered favourites at the beginning of the season. The superior power of the 302 cubic inch (4,942 cc) V8 in the GT40s allowed them to win on fast tracks, and especially at Le Mans two years in a row from 1968 (Pedro Rodr√≠guez and Lucien Bianchi) and 1969 (Jacky Ickx and Jackie Oliver), even though they were outclassed at twistier tracks. When it became apparent the GT40 would become obsolete after 1969, Wyer switched to the new Porsche 917. Wyers' team became the factory's main partner and was a major factor in developing the wedge-shaped Kurzheck tail of the 1970 917K which made the car much more stable than the original 1969 version. Battling with the works Ferrari 512's and the other Porsche teams, the JWA Gulf-Porsche 917's, raced by Jo Siffert, Brian Redman, Leo Kinnunen, Pedro Rodr√≠guez, Richard Attwood, Herbert Mueller and Derek Bell, earned seven out of Porsche's nine victories in the 10 races of the 1970 season, and five out of Porsche's eight victories in the 11 races of the 1971 season. During this period, the team's best result at Le Mans was second place in 1971. In fiction, a Gulf- Porsche 917K won in the cult Steve McQueen movie Le Mans, making the Gulf colours even more famous. In 1972, 5-litre sports cars like the 917s were banned, and the 3,000 cc Porsche 908 prototypes were also dropped by the factory as the new weight limit was too high, removing the 908's advantage that balanced their lack of power. Wyer adopted the new 3.0-litre regulations and started building Gulf-Mirage prototypes again, using a Formula One Cosworth DFV engine. The successful F1-engine was considered unsuited for endurance racing as vibrations took their toll after several hours, so necessitating modifications. After three years of attempts, Jacky Ickx and Derek Bell achieved what would be Wyers' last win at Le Mans in 1975. The following year, John Wyer retired from automotive competition and sold his team to Harley Cluxton's Grand Touring Cars operation. ==References== Category:1909 births Category:1989 deaths Category:British automotive engineers ","title":"John Wyer"},{"id":"1270010","text":"John Paul Jenkins (born 1981) is a local politician in Wales, in the United Kingdom. He is a county councillor for the Elli ward of Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, and a town councillor for the same ward on Llanelli Town Council. He stood for election as a candidate of the Conservative Party for both authorities. ==Background== Jenkins was educated at Graig Comprehensive School, Llanelli, before studying social policy at the University of Wales, Swansea. == Political career == Jenkins was elected at the local elections on 10 June 2004. As of 2006, he was the youngest elected representative in Carmarthenshire. Before becoming a councillor, Jenkins was chosen by the Conservative Party in 2002 to be its candidate for the Llanelli constituency at the 2003 election to the National Assembly for Wales. However, in March 2003, just two months before polling day, Jenkins was reported to have made homophobic remarks on an internet forum. The story was first reported in the Western Mail and subsequently on the BBC Wales news. Jenkins withdrew his candidacy although he claimed that his remarks had been taken out of context and that, \\"a lot of selective editing was carried out somewhere between my actual comments being made and the reporting of my remarks in the Western Mail and subsequently the BBC.\\" Later in 2003, Jenkins started his campaign for election to Carmarthenshire County Council. Running with the slogan \\"Standing up for Llanelli\\" Jenkins won election to Carmarthenshire County Council and Llanelli Town Council in 2004. As of 2006, he serves on Carmarthenshire County Council's Planning Committee and Social Justice Scrutiny Committee, the latter being the committee that scrutinises the Council's equal opportunity policies. He is also a Carmarthenshire Local Education Authority appointed governor of Bryngwyn Comprehensive School in Dafen, Llanelli. He also serves on Llanelli Town Council's Selwyn Samuel Management Committee and is a Minor Authority appointed governor of Old Road County Primary School in Llanelli. ===Second resignation=== On 15 February 2006, Jenkins was selected by the Conservative Party to contest the Carmarthen West and Pembrokeshire South constituency, to take place in 2007. The seat is seen as a winnable seat for the Conservatives, as opposed to the Llanelli constituency where Jenkins was intending to stand for in 2003. However, the following day, Jenkins resigned as a Conservative candidate for the second time. While attacks from opposition parties to Jenkins' selection were inevitable they were less than ferocious. Jenkins later commented that he was forced to resign by David Cameron who feared Jenkins' selection would undermine Cameron's attempt to re-brand the Conservative Party as inclusive to homosexuals. Jenkins subsequently announced that following his resignation as a candidate he was also quitting the Conservative Party because of what he saw as the Conservative Party's unfair treatment towards him. Jenkins claimed that he had been encouraged to apply to become a pre-approved Conservative candidate by the Party's group leader in the Welsh Assembly, Nicholas Bourne, had been subsequently pre-approved by the Conservative Party as a candidate and then selected to fight the Carmarthen West and Pembrokeshire South constituency by the local party in that seat but that the potential controversy that his selection could have caused and the effect on David Cameron's image led David Cameron to demand his resignation as a candidate despite the Conservative Party in Wales giving Jenkins its full backing. At the 2008 county council election Jenkins was re-elected by the Elli ward, but standing as an Independent. In August 2012 Jenkins got into trouble again for his comments on social media when he suggested on Twitter to an unemployed woman that she get work as an escort, then describing a well- known footballer as a \\"pervert\\". A complaint was made to the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales. ==References== * News stories relating to alleged homophobia: * Reports of second resignation: * Scotsman.com article published before Jenkins' resignation * Official Conservative Party website noting Jenkins' election as a Conservative Councillor in 2004 Accessed 19 March 2006 == External links == * Official website Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Councillors in Wales Category:People from Llanelli Category:Members of Carmarthenshire County Council ","title":"John Jenkins (Welsh politician)"},{"id":"1270015","text":"Sablon (in French) is a fine sand used as an abrasive and may refer to the following: == Surname == * Edmond Tarb√© des Sablons, (1838-1900), French journalist and man of letters * Germaine Sablon (1899‚Äì1985), French singer and film actress, sister of Jean Sablon * Jean Sablon (1906‚Äì1994), popular French singer and actor ==Toponyms== * Sablon (Brussels), an area in the historic center of Brussels, Belgium * Sablon, a neighborhood of Metz * Les Sablons (Paris M√©tro), a station of the Paris Metro located in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France * Blanc-Sablon, Quebec, municipality on North-Shore in Quebec, Canada ","title":"Sablons"},{"id":"1270019","text":"The Pontiac Grand Am is a mid-size car and later a compact car that was produced by Pontiac. The history of Grand Am starts with Pontiac executives noting incursion into the US market by Mercedes and BMW. Notably, the American sports car was usually without luxury features and the luxury car without sport features. Foreign makes mixed these features. Pontiac hybridized the Trans Am with the Grand Prix to create the Grand Am. Built on the A-body platform, the intended GTO body was re-badged and fitted with the Grand Prix interior. As the 1973 was produced, OPEC levied an oil embargo to the USA. This resulted in a dichotomy of buyers: total luxury or total economy. Since Grand Am was a ‚Äúin-betweener ‚Äú, its sales died and it was discontinued in 1975. The Grand Am had two separate three-year runs in the 1970s: from 1973 to 1975, and again from 1978 to 1980. It was based on the GM A platform. Production of the Grand Am was canceled in 1980 when it was replaced by the Pontiac 6000. The Grand Am was reintroduced in 1985 when it replaced the Pontiac Phoenix. It became Pontiac's best selling car and was later replaced by the Pontiac G6, so named as it was intended to be the 6th generation of the Grand Am. All 1973‚Äì1975 Grand Ams were built in Pontiac, Michigan at Pontiac's main assembly plant. The 1978-1980 Grand Ams were built in Pontiac, Michigan at Pontiac's main assembly plant and in Atlanta, Georgia at GMAD Lakewood. All Grand Ams between 1985 and 2005 were built in Lansing, Michigan at the Lansing Car Assembly. ==1973‚Äì1975== The original Grand Am was introduced in the fall of 1972 as a 1973 model. It was based on the GM A platform (A-body) along with other cars such as the Chevrolet Chevelle, Pontiac LeMans, Pontiac GTO, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, and the Buick Century. The GM A-body platform had major design revisions in 1973 that included the elimination of pillarless hardtops due to proposed Federal rollover standards, but with frameless windows similar to that of a hardtop. No convertibles were produced due to the rollover standards (that never were enacted). In addition to Federal emissions regulations, new safety standards required a impact-resistant front bumper and a impact-resistant rear bumper, which increased to for 1974. ===1973=== 1973 Grand Am The Grand Am, coined by Pontiac with a name derived from two other cars in its lineup (\\"Grand\\" signifying \\"Grand Prix luxury\\" and \\"Am\\" for \\"Trans Am performance\\") was designed as America's answer to European luxury/sport sedans and available as a four-door Colonnade sedan or a two-door Colonnade coupe. A total of 43,136 Grand Ams were built during the first year of production (both two-door and four-door models). The Grand Am could be had with a standard 2-bbl V8 engine with single exhaust producing , an optional 4-bbl version of this engine with single exhaust producing that was only available with a 4-speed manual transmission, an optional 4-bbl version of this engine with dual exhaust producing , or an optional 4-bbl with dual exhaust . Availability of Super Duty version of the 4-bbl 455 V8 did not materialize. The engine displacement, expressed in liters, was displayed on the bootlid in an effort to accentuate the car's supposedly European character. All engines were available with a Turbo-hydramatic 400 automatic transmission as standard equipment. A 4-speed manual transmission was available with the 400/4-bbl engine in 1973 and 1974, but this was not popular. The 1973 Pontiac Grand Am style had a unique flexible urethane front fascia center nose (known as the 'Endura' nose) that was squeezable and could return to its original shape following a minor collision along with the new energy-absorbing bumpers, a total of six grille openings with vertical bars, round front turn signals with a cross-hair design, horizontal rear tail lights, and chrome rear bumper. Additionally, Grand Ams featured a Radial Tuned Suspension (RTS) as standard equipment that included radial-ply tires, Pliacell shock absorbers, and front and rear sway bars. The springs were advertised as being computer selected. The Grand Am was one of only three GM cars to have standard radial tires and appropriate suspension tuning in 1973, with the others being the Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon and Chevrolet Monte Carlo S. The Grand Am included Strato bucket seats upholstered in Naugahyde vinyl or corduroy cloth featuring manual recliners and adjustable lumbar supports - both features common on European-style sports/luxury sedans, but unusual for American cars of that time. Also included were an instrument panel from the Pontiac Grand Prix featuring a Rally gauge cluster with fuel, oil, water and volt gauges (a tachometer or fuel economy gauge was optional, and on cars so equipped, the clock was moved to a space on the lower instrument panel under the radio), three-spoke padded steering wheel with brushed-stainless spokes, and Genuine Crossfire African Mahogany trim on the dash facing, radio and clock surrounds, as well as the center console between the front seats. Grand Ams also were among the first U.S.-built cars with a turn-signal mounted headlight dimmer switch that had been common on imported cars for decades. Other standard equipment included concealed windshield wipers, a front stabilizer bar, and an in-the-windshield radio antenna. Upscale options included air conditioning, tinted glass, power windows-locks-seat, rear defogger, various sound systems, and tilt-steering-wheel. AM/FM stereo with a tape player was optional. Pontiac also produced a single 1973 Grand Am station wagon as a feasibility study. This was a LeMans wagon converted to a Grand Am. A functional ram-air induction system was developed for the Pontiac A-bodies utilizing twin NACA openings in the hood, but the option was dropped due to inability to pass federally mandated drive-by noise standards. A few functional Ram Air systems were sold over the counter. The twin-scoop NACA hood was an option for any Pontiac A-body for all three years, but was non- functional. In a Popular Mechanics Owners survey, 67% rated the build quality as good to excellent and 79% liked the handling. However, 22.1% disliked the fuel economy. ===1974=== 1974 Grand Am hardtop, rear 1974 Grand Am hardtop Described as \\"The mid-sized Pontiac with Foreign Intrigue ... American Ingenuity\\" on the front cover of the four-page 1974 Grand Am brochure that featured a green four-door sedan, only minor styling changes highlighted this year's model including a redesigned nose and grille with 12 openings with horizontal bars. The 1974 Grand Am's rear-end styling was redesigned for the new 5 mph crash standards and had vertical rear taillights with relocated license plate and fuel filler above the bumper. Engine and transmission offerings were the same as 1973, but four-speed manual transmissions were no longer offered in California, where only the Turbo Hydra-matic automatic was available. Inside, the genuine African crossfire mahogany trim on the instrument panel was replaced by a simulated material due to delamination problems on the 1973 models but the real wood was continued on the center console, optional console clock, and radio bezel. Engine choices were 2-barrel single exhaust producing , 400 cubic inch 4-barrel single exhaust producing , 400 cubic inch 4-barrel dual exhaust producing , and 455 cubic inch 4-barrel dual exhaust producing . Sales were down more than 50 percent due to the 1973 oil crisis, and while the recession continued, prices increased for all 1974 model cars. Only 17,083 Grand Ams were built. ===1975=== The 1975 Grand Am looked the same as the 1974 model, but had vertical front grille bars, a body- colored rear bumper, and a catalytic converter single-exhaust, which mandated the use of unleaded fuel, along with GM's High Energy Ignition and other items promoted as part of Pontiac's maximum mileage system. In addition to the standard roofline with louvered rear side windows, Grand Am coupes with the optional vinyl roof could be ordered with a full triangular rear side window or a vertical opera window similar to that found on the Grand Prix. Inside, the Strato bucket seats received revised vertical trim patterns, the adjustable lumbar support controls were dropped, and only the passenger seat had a recliner, a \\"safety practice\\" which would continue at GM for a decade. New this year as a no-cost option was a 60/40 bench seat with center armrest. Engines were also detuned to meet the 1975 emission regulations with the compression ratio dropping to a new low of 7.6 to 1 on some engines. Standard was the V8 with two-barrel carburetor, optional were a 400, or a - both with four-barrel carburetors. Turbo Hydra-matic was standard equipment and the only transmission offered this year. Performance from 0-60 was 7.7 seconds. A total of 10,679 Grand Ams were built in 1975 and the series was dropped after this year due to declining sales and rising gas prices as a result of the 1973 oil crisis. Also a factor leading to the Grand Am's cancellation, were plans for all 1976 Pontiac A-body cars receiving the newly approved rectangular headlights, which would necessitate a complete redesign of the Grand Am's Endura nose and Pontiac officials decided that the expense of such a redesign could not be justified based on low production numbers. The basic GM A-body design remained until 1977. ===Production=== * 1973 Grand Am 2 door 34,445 * 1973 Grand Am 4 door 8,691 * 1973 Total 43,136 * 1974 Grand Am 2 door 13,961 * 1974 Grand Am 4 door 3,122 * 1974 Total 17,083 * 1975 Grand Am 2 door 8,786 * 1975 Grand Am 4 door 1,893 * 1975 Total 10,679 ===Engines=== *1973‚Äì1975 V8 with 2-barrel carburetor (standard engine, others were optional) *1973‚Äì1975 V8 with 4-barrel carburetor *1973‚Äì1974 V8 with 4-barrel carburetor, 4-speed (not available in California) *1973‚Äì1975 V8 with 4-barrel carburetor Notes: *A SD-455 equipped engineering prototype Grand Am was built and tested, but was later dismantled and destroyed. *1973 engines may have point or unitized ignition. *1974 engines may have point or unitized ignition or starting around May 1, 1974, HEI ignition. *1975 engines have HEI ignition. *1975 was the first year for the catalytic converter. ==1978‚Äì1980== ===1978=== Second generation Grand Am rear view The Grand Am returned for 1978 based on the Grand Prix's G platform, downsized from the previous generation, and offered in both two- and four-door models featuring a vertical bar grille and other trimmings to differentiate it from the LeMans, upon which it was based. Like the 1973-75 models, this generation of Grand Ams also featured standard radial tires plus an upgraded Radial Tuned Suspension with front and rear sway bars. Interiors were similar to the Grand LeMans with either a standard notchback bench seat, optional 60/40 bench or Strato bucket seats with console and recliner on passenger side, an optional tachometer, and a choice of either cloth or Morrokide vinyl upholstery. Standard equipment included power steering, power front disc brakes, Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, full instrumentation and Pontiac's V8 engine with two-barrel carburetor producing . Optional was a 4-bbl version, along with numerous extra cost items such as snowflake wheels, whitewall or white-lettered tires, power windows and seats, tilt steering wheel, sunroof, and cruise control. In California, where more stringent emission regulations made Pontiac V8 engines unavailable since 1977, Chevrolet V8 engines were substituted including a standard V8 with two-barrel carburetor or optional four-barrel version with . ===1979=== 1979 Pontiac Grand Am Very few changes were made for 1979 other than the normal trim revisions and the demotion of the standard powertrain to a Buick V6 and floor- mounted three-speed manual transmission as standard equipment. The 301 V8, rated at https://www.hotrod.com/articles/hppp-0710-1979-pontiac-grand-am/ with a two-barrel carburetor or with four-barrel, and Turbo Hydra-matic transmission were now optional. In terms of appearance, the only difference was that the park/signal and marker lenses were changed to amber ones.Gunnell and Kowalke, p. 155 New for 1979 was a four-speed manual available with the 150-horsepower 301 four-barrel in 49 states. In California, only an automatic transmission was available and engine offerings included the standard Buick V6 engine with two-barrel carburetor and or optional Chevrolet 305 V8 rated at with four-barrel carb. The wood-grained instrument panel was replaced by brushed aluminum trim, while the gauge faces changed from silver with black letters and numbers to black with white letters and numbers. The same seating choices in either cloth or Morrokide trims were offered including the standard notchback bench seat, or optional 60/40 bench or Strato bucket seats with console. An AM/FM CB radio combo was available and a heated rear window was optional. In 1979, the Grand Am was featured in the NASCAR Grand National circuit. ===1980=== The year 1980 was the finale for the second-generation Grand Am. The four-door sedan was dropped, leaving only the two-door coupe, which received only minor appearance changes. Strato bucket seats in cloth or Morrokide upholstery were standard equipment along with a center console with floor shifter for the Turbo Hydra-matic transmission. The V6 engine, two- barrel V8s and manual transmissions were dropped leaving the four-barrel Pontiac 301 V8 with the only engine offered in 49 states or, in California, the Chevrolet 305 V8. Slow sales of the Grand Am led to its discontinuation after the 1980 model year. In the first year of the NASCAR Busch Series (1982) the championship was won by Jack Ingram, in a 1980 Grand Am. ==1985‚Äì1991== For the 1985 model year, Pontiac reused the Grand Am name for a new compact car to replace the aging and unpopular Phoenix (based on GM's X Body) using the new- for-1985 N Body. The Grand Am shared the same front-wheel drive platform as the Buick Somerset (renamed Skylark in 1987) and the Oldsmobile Calais. Initially, the Grand Am was available in base or LE trim in coupes only. The 2.5 L Tech IV was standard, while a 3.0 L Buick V6 was optional. A 5-speed manual was standard, and a 3-speed automatic was optional, the latter required if the V6 engine was ordered. In 1986, a sedan and sportier SE trim were added. The SE trim had the V6 engine standard, lower body cladding, composite headlamps, a slightly revised interior with the different cloth used on all seats and door panel inserts, analog instrumentation (base and LE models had digital), and came standard with 14\\" aluminum wheels. 1985 LE coupe 1988 sedan, rear view 1991 sedan 1987 models brought more power to the base engine, and a new Turbocharged four-cylinder engine taken from the Sunbird GT. The 2.0L turbo engine became the base engine for the SE model for 1987. If one were to get the turbo engine, then the turbo boost gauge would take the place of the voltmeter. Popular Mechanics did the quarter-mile with the Turbo engine and five-speed manual in 15.73 seconds and the automatic transmission 16.02 seconds. They noted large amounts of torque steer from a dead stop. This was also the last year that the Buick sourced 3.0 L engine would be available in the Grand Am, as it was discontinued in mid-1987. New for styling were composite front headlights, but only on the LE models. For 1988, front seat belts were moved from the b-pillars to the doors, to meet the passive restraint mandate for 1989. The Quad-4 LD2 engine became available for Grand Am's in 1988, replacing the previous model years 3.0L V6 on the options list. It is worth noting that 'Sport buckets' borrowed from the Trans Am GTA, were added to the options list this year for SE's. Other options included a Driver Information Center, an electronic trunk release, and a moon roof. The base model was dropped after this model year.

Newbold was historically a village in its own right, but was incorporated into Rugby in 1932. The name is derived from the Saxon Niowebold ('New house'). The ancient parish of Newbold-on-Avon contained the nearby settlements of Harborough Parva, Cosford, Long Lawford and Little Lawford. The latter three became separate civil parishes in the 19th century, while Harborough Parva was transferred to Harborough Magna parish in 1931. The older part of the village of Newbold sits on a hill north of the Avon on the B4112 road, and contains some old buildings, including some red brick 18th-century houses and some timber-framed buildings from the 17th century. The church of St Botolph in the old village dates from the 15th century, and is grade I listed and stands on the site of an earlier church. Newbold grew considerably during the 20th century, with a number of modern housing and industrial estates having been built to the east of the old village at the foot of the hill, around the Avon valley. The Oxford Canal runs immediately to the north of Newbold, here it runs through the 250-metre-long Newbold Tunnel; This tunnel was built in 1829 as part of a scheme to straighten out the winding canal, and it replaced an older tunnel which dated from 1777 on the original route, which ran at a right-angle to the newer tunnel. The southern portal of the abandoned tunnel can be seen next to the churchyard, it is now bricked up but with two holes to allow for bats to enter. There is a canalside pub at Newbold, the Barley Mow (a second one The Boat having now closed). There is also another pub called the Newbold Crown closer to the centre of the village. There are some former limestone quarries in the Newbold area. One of them has been converted into a nature reserve, known as Newbold Quarry Park. Another park named Newbold Centenary Park opened in 2016 off Parkfield Road: built on the site of former allotments, it was so named to mark the centenary of the First World War. The main secondary school in Newbold is the Avon Valley School, which was formerly known as Newbold Grange High School until the early-1990s. Newbold is home to Newbold-on-Avon RFC.

A climbing guide and ski instructor, Terray was active in mountain combat against Germany during World War II. After the war, he became well known as one of the best Chamonix climbers and guides, noted for his speedy ascents of some of the most notorious climbs in the French, Italian, and Swiss Alps: the Walker Spur of the Grandes Jorasses, the south face of the Aiguille Noire de Peuterey, the north-east face of Piz Badile, and the north face of the Eiger. Terray, frequently with climbing partner Louis Lachenal, broke previous climbing speed records. Terray was a member of Maurice Herzog's 1950 expedition to the Nepalese Himalayan peak, Annapurna, the highest peak climbed at the time, and the first 8000-meter peak climbed (although British climbers George Mallory, Andrew Irvine, George Finch, Geoffrey Bruce, Henry Morshead, Teddy Norton and Howard Somervell had reached higher altitudes on Mount Everest during the 1920s). Terray did not reach the summit of Annapurna, but together with the Sherpa Adjiba he aided summiteers Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal down from the mountain. Both Herzog and Lachenal experienced extreme frostbite and subsequently underwent amputations. Despite these events, the French team returned to Paris to huge public acclaim, and Herzog's expedition book Annapurna became an international bestseller. Terray made the second ascent of the North Face of the Eiger in 1947, with Louis Lachenal. He was also one of the main participants in the great attempt to rescue four climbers trapped on the north face of the Eiger in 1957. This mission forms the subject of Jack Olsen's famous book, The Climb Up To Hell, in which Terray's skill and bravery receive special mention. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Terray made a number of first ascents in Peru, including the highest unclimbed peak in the central Andes at the time, Huantsan. He also made first ascents of lower but more difficult peaks, including Willka Wiqi, Soray, Tawllirahu, and Chakrarahu/Chacraraju, possibly the hardest peak in the Peruvian Andes and considered unclimbable at the time. One of Terray's finest achievements was the first ascent of Jannu in Nepal in 1962. He also climbed the Nilgiris near Annapurna, and led the successful 1964 first ascent of Mount Huntington, in the Alaska Range, by the northwest ridge. Terray organised a rescue attempt of two climbers stranded on Mont Blanc in December 1956. For this he was expelled from the Chamonix Guide's Association, which had refused to participate in the rescue from the start on the grounds that the risk to the rescuers would be too great. Due to the fact that no other guides would accompany him, Terray set out a small team of amateurs. They were turned back on 1 January 1957 either by poor weather or on the understanding that a helicopter would attempt a rescue the following day. Terray was highly critical of the Chamonix Guide Association's inaction when the alarm had first been raised. Terray died on a rock climb in the Vercors, south of Grenoble, on 19 September 1965, several years after the publication of his climbing memoir, Conquistadors of the Useless. His grave is situated in Chamonix, France. A traffic circle is named for him in Chamonix, WSW of town. ==Bibliography== * * * ==References== Category:1921 births Category:1965 deaths Category:People from Grenoble Category:French mountain climbers Category:Mountaineering deaths Category:Sport deaths in France Category:People associated with the Eiger Category:Sportspeople from Is√®re ","title":"Lionel Terray"},{"id":"1270058","text":"An Empacher 8+ racing shell from Harvard University at thumb Empacher (company name Bootswerft Empacher GmbH) is a manufacturer of boats. Today, they produce racing shells for the sport of rowing. ==History== Originally building sailing yachts, Willy Empacher founded his boatyard with Wilhelm Karlisch during 1923 in K√∂nigsberg, East Prussia. The boatyard was the largest east of Berlin during the 1930s. They built boats for Germany during the war, but in 1945 the family fled their town and reached Eberbach, Germany in 1947. Willy started a new business at the Seibert boat-yard in Eberbach repairing and making small boats. In 1952 they started producing racing rowing shells, an enterprise that has become their main business today. The business took off after Jochen Mei√üner won the silver medal while racing in an Empacher single scull during the 1968 Summer Olympics. They built mainly moulded cedarwood racing shells, but collaborated with BASF to produce the world's first plastic shell in 1956. Empacher built the first plastic to receive a gold medal during the 1972 Munich Olympics. This was also the first race worthy sandwich-build plastic boat. This process includes using a wood frame to create the boat hull and then filling with it with composite material. Hans Empacher, Willy's eldest son, took over the business in 1970. Hans optimized the company by creating internal competition and promoting plastic boat construction. Upon the death of his brother Rainer in October 2018, Helmut Empacher became the sole owner of the business. ==Boats== Boats built by Empacher are easily identified by their pale yellow color and black trim. Empacher produce every FISA-recognized racing boat category. The company tries to produce two new boat designs every year. ===Manufacturing=== Empacher, as all other racing shell manufacturers, have replaced wooden boats with carbon fibre and honeycomb sandwich constructions. The nomex honeycomb reinforces the kevlar/carbon fibre inner and outer frames. Empacher uses a vacuum bag technique to bond the outer layers with the honeycomb core. Combining kevlar and epoxy resin creates a tear and impact resistant outer shell. Empacher reinforces the gunwale with an additional carbon layer and carbon foam frames. Empacher offers a wide range of boat molds for each category (such as eights and coxless fours) and rigger options. Different molds suit different weight racing categories. A lightweight rowing team would use a different mould than an openweight team. Also depending on the team's needs, classical multi-stay aluminium riggers, carbon two stay riggers of carbon fibre, aluminium wing rigger, and carbon wing riggers are offered. Wing riggers are used for sweep rowing. ===Successes=== Empacher rowing shells are used by a large number of crews rowing in international competitions, including World Championships and the Summer Olympics. Overall, Empacher boats have received 64% of the wins in all race categories during 2013.http://www.empacher.com/images/13e.jpg In the eights, all crews but the USA (who used a Hudson) used Empacher boats during the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Olympics. In the 2012 London Olympics, Empacher boats won almost all boat categories with ten out of fourteen gold medals.http://www.empacher.com/images/19.jpg ===Competition=== Other big racing shell manufacturers include companies such as: Hudson, WinTech, Pocock, Janousek, and Filippi. ==See also== *Racing Shells ==References== ==External links== * Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1923 Category:Manufacturing companies of Germany Category:Rowing equipment manufacturers Category:1923 establishments in Germany ","title":"Empacher"},{"id":"1270063","text":"muMATH is a computer algebra system (CAS), which was developed in the late 1970s and early eighties by Albert D.

The partition was followed by a number of Polish uprisings during the period. ==Background== Following the First Partition of Poland in 1772, in an attempt to strengthen the significantly weakened Commonwealth, King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski put into effect a series of reforms to enhance Poland's military, political system, economy, and society. These reforms reached their climax with the enactment of the May Constitution in 1791, which established a constitutional monarchy with separation into three branches of government, strengthened the bourgeoisie and abolished many of the nobility's privileges as well as many of the old laws of serfdom. In addition, to strengthen Poland's international standings, King Stanislaus signed the Polish-Prussian Pact of 1790, ceding further territories to Prussia in exchange for a military alliance. Angered by what was seen as dangerous, Jacobin-style reforms, Russia invaded Poland in 1792, beginning the War in Defense of the Constitution. Abandoned by her Prussian allies and betrayed by Polish nobles who desired to restore the privileges they had lost under the May Constitution, Poland was forced to sign the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, which ceded Dobrzyn, Kujavia, and a large portion of Greater Poland to Prussia and all of Poland's eastern provinces from Moldavia to Livonia to Russia, reducing Poland to one-third of her original size before the First Partition. Outraged with the further humiliation of Poland by her neighbors and the betrayal by the Polish nobility, and emboldened by the French Revolution unfolding in France, the Polish masses quickly turned against the occupying forces of Prussia and Russia. Following a series of nationwide riots, on March 24, 1794, Polish patriot Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko took command of the Polish armed forces and declared a nationwide uprising against Poland's foreign occupiers, marking the beginning of the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising. Catherine II and Frederick William II were quick to respond and, despite initial successes by Kosciuszko's forces, the uprising was crushed by November 1794. According to legend, when Kosciuszko fell off of his horse at the Battle of Maciejowice, shortly before he was captured, he said \\"Finis Poloniae\\", meaning in Latin \\"[This is] the end of Poland.\\" ==Terms== Austrian, Prussian, and Russian representatives met on October 24, 1795, to dissolve the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, with the three conquering powers signing a treaty to divide the region on January 26, 1797. This gave the Habsburg Monarchy control of the Western Galicia and Southern Masovia territories, with approximately 1.2 million people; Prussia received Podlachia, the remainder of Masovia, and Warsaw, with 1 million people; and Russia received the remaining land, including Vilnius and 1.2 million people. Unlike previous partitions, no Polish representative was party to the treaty. The Habsburgs, Russia, and Prussia forced King Stanislaus to abdicate and retire to St. Petersburg, where he died as Catherine II's trophy prisoner in 1798. The victors also agreed to erase the country's name: > \\"In view of the necessity to abolish everything which could revive the > memory of the existence of the Kingdom of Poland, now that the annulment of > this body politic has been effected ... the high contracting parties are > agreed and undertake never to include in their titles ... the name or > designation of the Kingdom of Poland, which shall remain suppressed as from > the present and forever ...\\"Davies, Norman. God's Playground: A History of > Poland. Revised Edition ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2005. ==Aftermath== Part of the permanent exhibition dedicated to the partitions of Poland at the Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw The Third Partition of Poland ended the existence of an independent Polish and Lithuanian state for the next 123 years. Immediately following the Third Partition, the occupying powers forced many Polish politicians, intellectuals, and revolutionaries to emigrate across Europe, in what was later known as the Great Emigration. These Polish nationalists participated in uprisings against Austria, Prussia, and Russia in former Polish lands, and many would serve France as part of Napoleon's armies. In addition, Polish poets and artists would make the desire for national freedom a defining characteristic of the Polish Romanticist movement. Poland briefly regained semi-autonomy in 1807 when Napoleon created the Duchy of Warsaw, but this effectively ended with the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The Congress created the Kingdom of Poland, sometimes called Congress Poland, as a Russian puppet state. Even this, however, came to an end after a Polish insurrection in 1831, at which point Russia dissolved the Congress Kingdom and exacted multiple punitive measures on the Polish populace. In 1867, Russia made Poland an official part of the Russian Empire, as opposed to a puppet state. Poland would not regain full independence until the end of World War I when the signing of the Treaty of Versailles and the collapse of the Russian Empire allowed for the resurrection of Polish national sovereignty. ==See also== *Administrative division of Polish territories after partitions *Administrative division of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in the course of partitions *Fourth Partition of Poland ==References== ===Footnotes=== ===Bibliography=== * Davies, Norman.

Located on the shores of the Balsem√£o River, the municipality has a population of 26,691,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 165.42 km2. With origins before the Roman occupation of the Iberian Peninsula, Lamego is known for its historic city center, having a long history as a principal city of the former Tr√°s-os-Montes e Alto Douro Province. Legend holds that the first Portuguese Cortes were held in Lamego, in 1143. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Lamego is based in the city center. ==Etymology== The toponymic name Lamego was derived from Lamaecus, a name Roman-Hispanic derivative to indicate the possessor of agrarian titles in the 3rd century around the local castle.M. Gon√ßalves da Costa (1977), p.45 ==History== Lamego Castle, with origins in the 5th century. The area around Lamego was inhabited by Ligures and Turduli, and during the Roman presence it was occupied by Coelerni, which left behind several monuments. Due to the placement of the castle, it is likely that a castro originally existed on the site. During the Inquiri√ß√µes (Inventory/Enquiries) of King Afonso (during the 13th century) there was reference to the Castro de Lameco, referred to as a medieval fortification. Destroyed by the Romans, the inhabitants were forced to descend into the valley and cultivate the land, as part of the Roman reorganization of the land. ===Middle Ages=== Lamego became Catholic when the Visigothic king Rekared I converted to Catholicism. In 569, during the Council of Lugo, there appeared references to Sardin√°rio the Bishop of Lamego. During the reign of Sisebuto (612-621), the Visigothic monarch coined currency from Lamego, indicating the importance of the region to commerce and culture. Just outside the city center is the tiny 7th century S√£o Pedro de Balsem√£o Chapel, a Visigothic chapel believed to be the oldest in Portugal (and second oldest in Europe). A region alternated between peace and war in the following years as Christians and Muslims fought the territory during the Reconquista, until Ferdinand I of Le√≥n and Castile conquered the region definitively on 29 November 1057. As a consequence the bishopric was moved after these events (to later be restored in 1071). In 1128, the nascent national Egas Moniz, had his tenancy in Lamego while his residence was in Britiande, as master of the Riba‚ÄìDouro, between Paiva and T√°vora (in addition to the lands of C√¥a). The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption, built in 1129. The most significant moment in the town's history was in 1139, when nobles declared Afonso Henriques to be Portugal's first king. The town's Gothic cathedral was built by him, although only the Romanesque tower is left from the original building, with its carved Renaissance portal and fine cloister dating from the 16th and 18th centuries. The 12th-century castle preserves a fine keep and a very old and unusual cistern with monograms of master masons. King Sancho I issued a charter of independence in 1191, as the local community grew around two poles: the ecclesiastical parishes of S√© and Castelo. In 1290, King Denis provided a market charter to the city, attracting merchants from Castile and Granada with their oriental spices and textiles. Lamego had a privileged positioned on the routes from western Iberia, as a transit point within the settlements of the Al√©m-Douro, Braga and Guimar√£es, from Alc√¢ntara and M√©rida to C√≥rdoba and Seville. It was also one of the preferred routes on the Saint James Way pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. But, two events changed the economic and social circumstances in the region: the conquest of Granada which drove the last of the Moors from the Peninsula; and the discovery of the maritime connection to India, which resulted in a slow decline for the region. ===Early modern era=== Sanctuary of Our Lady of Rem√©dios, built in 1750. Manuel I of Portugal issued a foral (charter) in 1514. Also in the 16th century, Manuel de Noronha (one of the more notable prelates of Lamego) was appointed the Bishop of Lamego, occupying the role for the next 18 years and referred to the \\"great builder\\", responsible for the cult of Nossa Senhora dos Rem√©dios (Our Lady of Remedies). In the 17th and 18th century, the solares (country estates) were slowly constructed in Lamego, resulting from the wine commerce down the Douro. The economic growth of viticulture along the Douro resulted in the issuance of a writ by Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal, to designate the area as the Regi√£o Demarcada do Douro and the establishment of the Companhia Geral da Agricultura das Vinhas do Alto Douro (General Company of the Wine Agriculture of the Upper Douro). In 1835, Lamego was the capital of the district, but lost this title to Viseu (December 1835), under the authority of the King's Minister Lu√≠s Mouzinho de Albuquerque. In 1919, in an attempt to restore the monarchy, Lamego became the capital of the district for 24 days. During the second half of the 19th century, during the presidency of the Viscount of Guedes Teixeira, Lamego begins a process of modernization with the construction of new avenues. After the establishment of the First Republic, during the presidency of Alfredo de Sousa, Lamego undergoes a new phase of building, including the construction a bridge over the Coura River. ==Twin towns ‚Äì sister cities== * Bouchemaine, France ==Geography== ===Human geography=== Administratively, the municipality is divided into 18 civil parishes (freguesias): * Lamego (Almacave e S√©) * Av√µes * Bigorne, Magueija e Pretarouca * Britiande * Cambres * Cep√µes, Meijinhos e Melc√µes * Ferreirim * Ferreiros de Av√µes * Figueira * Lalim * Lazarim * Parada do Bispo e Valdigem * Penaj√≥ia * Penude * Samod√£es * Sande * V√°rzea de Abrunhais * Vila Nova de Souto d'El-Rei ==Economy== Our Lady of Rem√©dios Park. The principal activities in this region are tied to the service sector, with commerce and agriculture also representing an important part of the economy. In particular viticulture, since the municipality (and other municipalities in the region) have been designated as part of the Denomina√ß√£o de Origem Controlada (DOC), a control used to classify wine products as a locally produced product of origin, for national and international marketing. Lamego has a large shopping centre, with approximately 30 main shops, three malls of medium-size and several small traditional shops. Industrial activities are concentrated in the industrial zone in the parish of V√°rzea de Abrunhais. Lamego textiles are also promoted but tend to be small-scale production runs, with few medium- to large- companies involved in mass-production. The tourist sector is primarily associated with the monuments and religious buildings, and has been a growing part of the local economy. The extension of the A24 motorway has been important in attracting more visitors and businesses to the region. ==Culture== Ribeiro Concei√ß√£o Theatre. Lamego is considered one of the principal cities of the Portuguese Barroque, for its numerous churches, palaces, and civic buildings. The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lamego and has a cathedral. The following cultural institutions are based in Lamego: *Ribeiro Concei√ß√£o Theatre *Lamego City Museum *Lamego Municipal Library *Lamego Image Archive *Clav'Art *APC - Amigos Pela Cultura *ArqDoc ‚Äì Lamego Document Archive The film Abraham's Valley (1993) is set in and around Lamego. ==Notable people== Gentil Guedes Gomes. *Gaius Appuleius Diocles, Roman charioteer (104-146) *Egas Moniz, nobleman of the second County of Portugal (1080 - 1146) *Jos√© Augusto Guedes Teixeira, Civil Governor of Porto District (1843 - 1890) *Fausto Guedes Teixeira, poet (1871 - 1940) *Gentil Guedes Gomes, writer (1896 - 1970) *Fernando Monteiro de Amaral, 7th President of the Assembly of the Republic (1925 - 2009) *M√°rio Lemos Pires, last Governor of Portuguese Timor (1930 - 2009) *Jo√£o Botelho, film director (1949) *√Ålvaro Magalh√£es, writer (1951) *Jos√© Maria Pedroto, footballer for F.C.

Because assault requires intent, it is considered an intentional tort, as opposed to a tort of negligence. Actual ability to carry out the apprehended contact is not necessary. In Criminal Law an assault is defined as an attempt to commit battery, requiring the specific intent to cause physical injury. ==Comparison to battery== As distinguished from battery, assault does not need to involve actual contact; it only needs intent to make or threaten contact and the resulting apprehension.Cullison v. Medley, 570 N.E.2d 27 (Ind. 1991) At one point, the common law understanding of assault required more than words alone, it also required an overt act. This understanding has changed, while words alone can't be construed as assault, words coinciding with actions or circumstances that would put a person in reasonable apprehension that a harm or offensive contact was likely to occur would.Restatement (Third) of Torts: Inten. Torts to Persons ¬ß 103 DD (2014) For example, an actor shouting \\"I'm going to kill you\\" while not moving but in complete shadow and with a knife in their hand could be interpreted as assault. Additionally, Fear is not required for an assault to occur, only anticipation of subsequent battery. A battery can occur without a preceding assault, such as if a person is struck in the back of the head. An assault can be an attempted battery. ==Elements== Three elements must be established in order to establish tortious assault: first, there must be a positive act by the defendant;. second, the plaintiff had reasonable apprehension (the requisite state of mind) of immediate physical contact,. and third, the defendant's act of interference was intentional (the defendant intended the resulting apprehension).. But intent for purposes of civil assault can be either general or specific. Specific intent means that when the defendant acted, he or she intended to cause apprehension of a harmful or unwanted contact. General intent means that the defendant knew with substantial certainty that the action would put someone in apprehension of a harmful or unwanted contact. While the law varies by jurisdiction, contact is often defined as harmful if it objectively intends to injure, disfigure, impair, or cause pain. The act is deemed offensive if it would offend a reasonable person's sense of personal dignity. While imminence is judged objectively and varies widely on the facts, it generally suggests there is little to no opportunity for intervening acts.R v Knight (1988) 35 A Crim R 314, Zanker v Vartzokas (1988) 34 A Crim R. Lastly, the state of apprehension should be differentiated from the general state of fear, as apprehension requires only that the person be aware of the imminence of the harmful or offensive act. In Australia, the test for proving tortious assault is formulated as requiring 'proof of an intention to create in another person an apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact' . ==Defenses== Assault can be justified in situations of self-defense or defense of a third party where the act was deemed reasonable. It can also be justified in the context of a sport where consent may be given or implied. An act of assault may also be privileged, meaning that the person who commits the assault had the legal right to do so and cannot be sued, as might occur if a police officer draws a firearm on a criminal suspect. Lastly, automatism (e.g., sleep walking) acts to negate the intent element as someone acting while asleep is not acting voluntarily. ==See also== *Assault *Battery (crime) *Battery (tort) ==References== Category:Tort law Category:Civil law (common law) Category:Lawsuits ","title":"Assault (tort)"},{"id":"1270081","text":"Saint-Amant may refer to: ==People== *Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant (1800‚Äì1872), French chess player *Antoine Girard de Saint-Amant (1594‚Äì1661), French poet ==Places== *St. Amant, Louisiana, United States *communes in France: **Saint-Amant, Charente, in the Charente d√©partement **Saint-Amant-de- Boixe, in the Charente d√©partement **Saint-Amant-de-Bonnieure, in the Charente d√©partement **Saint-Amant-de-Nou√®re, in the Charente d√©partement **Saint- Amant-Roche-Savine, in the Puy-de-D√¥me d√©partement **Saint-Amant-Tallende, in the Puy-de-D√¥me d√©partement ==Other== *St. Amant (horse), winner of the 1904 Epsom Derby. *St. Amant Winery, located in Woodbridge, CA. *St. Amant's, hotel/restaurant/marina, Britt, Ontario. ==See also== *Saint-Amand (disambiguation) *Saint-Amans (disambiguation) *Saint Amand ","title":"Saint-Amant"},{"id":"1270083","text":"Colonization of the Congo basin refers to the European colonization of the Congo Basin of tropical Africa. It was the last part of the continent to be colonized. By the end of the 19th century, the Basin had been carved up by European colonial powers, into the Congo Free State, the French Congo and the Portuguese Congo (modern Cabinda Province of Angola). ==Early European exploration== Map of explorations in the Congo (in the course of the 19th century) One by one the other great mysteries had been explored: * The coasts by Prince Henry the Navigator's Portuguese sailors in the 15th century. * The Blue Nile by James Bruce in 1773. * The remote upper Niger by Mungo Park in 1796. * The vast Sahara by competitors Laing, Cailli√©, and Clapperton in the 1820s. * The fever-ridden mangroves of the lower Niger by the brothers Richard and John Lander in 1830. * Southern Africa and the Zambezi by Livingstone and John Clafton in the 1850s. * The upper Nile by Burton, Speke, and Baker in a succession of expeditions between 1857 and 1868. Though the Congo had been one of the first to be attempted, it remained a mystery. Since the 15th century, European explorers had sailed into the broad Congo estuary, planning to fight their way up the falls and rapids that begin only inland, and then travel up the river to its unknown source. All failed. The rapids and falls, had they known it, extended for inland, and the terrain close by the river was impassable, and remains so to this day. Repeated attempts to travel overland were repulsed with heavy casualties, accidents, conflicts with natives, and, above all, disease saw large and well-equipped expeditions got no further than or so past the western-most rapid, the legendary Cauldron of Hell. ==Stanley's exploration== The Congo Free State It was not until 1867 that the Congo was explored by Europeans, and even then it was not from the sea, but from the other side of the African continent. Setting out from Zanzibar, Henry Morton Stanley, a British-born American journalist and explorer aimed to find the famous Dr. Livingstone. Livingstone had not been heard from in several years and was, in fact, exploring the upper reaches of a great navigable inland river called the Lualaba, which Livingstone hoped was connected to the Nile, but which turned out to be the upper Congo. After leaving Livingstone, Stanley sailed for 1,000 miles (1,600 km) down the Lualaba (Upper Congo) to the large lake he named Stanley Pool (now called Pool Malebo). Then, rather than perish in the impenetrable country of the cascades, Stanley took a wide detour overland to come within striking distance of the Portuguese trading station at Boma on the Congo estuary. ==Prelude to conquest== ===Henry Morton Stanley=== Henry Morton Stanley, above, found Dr. Livingstone in Africa and brought tales back to Europe When Stanley returned to Europe in 1878, he had not only found Dr. Livingstone (an event remembered to this day), resolved the last great mystery of African exploration, and ruined his health: he had also opened the heart of tropical Africa up to the outside world. This was to be his most enduring legacy. Stanley was lionised across Europe. He wrote articles, appeared at public meetings, lobbied the rich and powerful tirelessly; and always his theme was the boundless opportunity for commercial exploitation of the lands he had discovered or, in his own words, to \\"pour the civilisation of Europe into the barbarism of Africa\\". \\"There are 40,000,000 nude people\\" on the other side of the rapids, Stanley wrote, \\"and the cotton-spinners of Manchester are waiting to clothe them... Birmingham's factories are glowing with the red metal that shall presently be made into ironwork in every fashion and shape for them... and the ministers of Christ are zealous to bring them, the poor benighted heathen, into the Christian fold.\\" Europe was less than keen on the idea: the great European scramble for Africa had not yet begun. Outside of the Cape of Good Hope and the Mediterranean coast, Europe had no African colonies of any significance. The focus of the great powers was still firmly on the lands that had made Europe's fortune: the Americas, the East Indies, India, China, and Australasia. There seemed no economic sense to investing energy in Africa when the returns from other colonies were likely to be both richer and more immediate. Nor was there a strong humanitarian interest in the continent now that the American slave trade had been extinguished. Stanley was applauded, admired, decorated--and ignored. === King Leopold II of Belgium === King Leopold II's determination to conquer a piece of Africa sent Stanley back to establish the Congo Free State It is at this point that Leopold II of Belgium took a part. In Peter Forbath's words, Leopold was: > A tall, imposing man ... enjoying a reputation for hedonistic sensuality, > cunning intelligence (his father once described him as subtle and sly as a > fox), overweening ambition, and personal ruthlessness. He was, nevertheless, > an extremely minor monarch in the realpolitik of the times, ruling a totally > insignificant nation, a nation in fact that had come into existence barely > four decades before and lived under the constant threat of losing its > precarious independence to the great European powers around it. He was a > figure who, one might have had every reason to expect, would devote himself > to maintaining his country's strict neutrality, avoiding giving offence to > any of his powerful neighbours, and indulging his keenly developed tastes > for the pleasures of the flesh, rather than one who would make a profound > impact on history. Yet, in the most astonishing and improbable way > imaginable, he managed virtually single-handedly to upset the balance of > power in Africa and usher in the terrible age of European colonialism on the > black continent.Forbath, P. The River Congo: The Discovery, Exploration, and > Exploitation of the World's Most Dramatic River, 1991 (Paperback). Harper & > Row. . As a constitutional monarch, Leopold was charged with the usual constitutional duties of opening parliaments, greeting diplomats, and attending state funerals. He had no power to decide policy. But for over 20 years he had been agitating for Belgium to take its place among the great colonial powers of Europe. Leopold noted, \\"Our frontiers can never be extended into Europe.\\" However, he added, \\"since history teaches that colonies are useful, that they play a great part in that which makes up the power and prosperity of states, let us strive to get one in our turn.\\"Ewans, Martin (2002). European Atrocity, African Catastrophe: Leopold II, the Congo Free State and Its Aftermath. London, Curzon Press, p.27. At various times, he launched unsuccessful schemes to buy an Argentine province, to buy Borneo from the Dutch, rent the Philippines from Spain, or establish colonies in China, Vietnam, Japan, or the Pacific islands. When the 1860s explorers focused attention on Africa, Leopold schemed to colonise Mozambique on the east coast, Senegal on the west coast, and the Congo in the centre. None of these schemes came anywhere near fruition: the government of Belgium resolutely resisted all Leopold's suggestions, seeing the acquisition of a colony as a good way to spend large amounts of money for little or no return. Leopold's eventual response was extraordinary in its hubris and simplicity. If the government of Belgium would not take a colony, then he would simply do it himself, acting in his private capacity as an ordinary citizen. ===Brussels Geographic Conference=== In 1876, Leopold II sponsored an international geographical conference in Brussels, inviting delegates from scientific societies all over Europe to discuss philanthropic and scientific matters such as the best way to coordinate map making, to prevent the re-emergence of the west coast slave trade, and to investigate ways of sending medical aid to Africa. The conference was a sham: at its close, Leopold proposed that they set up an international benevolent committee to carry on, and modestly agreed to accept the chairman's role. He created a baffling series of subsidiary shell organisations, culminating in the cunningly named International African Association (), which had a single shareholder: Leopold himself. For the look of things, he held one more meeting the following year, but from that time on, the International African Association was simply a front for Leopold's ambition. ===Stanley as Leopold's agent=== Soon after Stanley returned from the Congo, Leopold tried to recruit him. Stanley, still hopeful for British backing, brushed him off. However, Leopold persisted and eventually Stanley gave in. Leopold II, it seemed, was the only European willing to finance Stanley's dream: the building of a railway over the Crystal Mountains from the sea to Stanley Pool, from which river steamers could reach 1,000 miles (1,600 km) into the heart of Africa.Henry Morton Stanley (2011). The Congo and the Founding of Its Free State: A Story of Work and Exploration. Cambridge University Press. p.20. Stanley, much more familiar with the rigours of the African climate and the complexities of local politics than Leopold ‚Äî Leopold II never set foot in the Congo ‚Äî persuaded his patron that the first step should be the construction of a wagon trail and a series of forts. Leopold agreed and in deepest secrecy, Stanley signed a five-year contract at a salary of ¬£1,000 a year, and set off to Zanzibar under an assumed name. To avoid discovery, materials and workers were shipped in by various roundabout routes, and communications between Stanley and Leopold were entrusted to Colonel Maximilien Strauch.Hochschild, Adam (October 6, 2005). \\"In the Heart of Darkness\\". The New York Review of Books. Retrieved September 22, 2017. It was only at this point that Stanley was informed of the magnitude of Leopold's ambition: Stanley was not merely to construct a series of trading stations, he was to secretly carve out an entire nation. The instructions were direct and to the point: \\"It is a question of creating a new State, as big as possible, and of running it. It is clearly understood that in this project there is no question of granting the slightest political power to the negros. That would be absurd.\\" Apparently finding nothing reprehensible about Leopold's ambitions, Stanley set about his task with a will. For all his social shortcomings in European society, he was undoubtedly the right man for the job. Within three years, his capacity for hard work, his skill at playing one social group off against another, his ruthless use of modern weaponry to kill opponents, and above all his relentless determination opened the route to the Upper Congo. In later years, Stanley would write that the most vexing part of his duties was not the work itself, nor negotiating with the natives, but keeping order amongst the ill- assorted collection of white men he had brought with him as overseers, who squabbled constantly over small matters of rank or status. \\"Almost all of them\\", he wrote, \\"clamoured for expenses of all kinds, which included ... wine, tobacco, cigars, clothes, shoes, board and lodging, and certain nameless extravagances\\" (by which he meant attractive slaves to warm their beds). Exhausted, Stanley returned to Europe, only to be sent straight back by Leopold, who promised him an outstanding assistant: Charles 'Chinese' Gordon (who did not in fact take up Leopold's offer but chose instead to go to meet his fate at Khartoum). \\"It is indispensable\\", instructed Leopold, \\"that you should purchase for the ' (i.e., Leopold himself) as much land as you can obtain\\". Having established a beachhead on the lower Congo, in 1883 Stanley set out upriver to extend Leopold's domain, employing his usual methods: negotiations with local chiefs buying sovereignty in exchange for bolts of cloth and trinkets; playing one tribe off another; and if need be, simply shooting an obstructive chief and negotiating with his cowed successor instead. However, as he approached Stanley Falls at the junction between the Congo proper and the Lualaba (close to the general vicinity of Central Africa where he had found Livingstone six years before), it soon became clear that Stanley's men were not the only intruders. ===Dealings with Zanzibari slave traders=== Zanzibari slave trader Tippu Tip raided villages to enslave their people in advance of Stanley's arrival Tippu Tip, the most powerful of the Zanzibari slave traders of the 19th century, was well known to Stanley, as was the social chaos and devastation that slave-hunting brought. It had only been through Tippu Tip's help that Stanley had found Livingstone (who himself had survived years on the Lualaba by virtue of Tippu Tip's friendship). Now, Stanley discovered, Tippu Tip's men had reached still further west in search of fresh populations to enslave. Four years before, the Zanzibaris had thought the Congo deadly and impassable, and warned Stanley not to attempt to go there, but when Tippu Tip learned in Zanzibar that Stanley had survived, he was quick to act. Villages throughout the region had been burned and depopulated. Tippu Tip had raided 118 villages, killed 4,000 Africans, and, when Stanley reached his camp, had 2,300 slaves, mostly young women and children, in chains ready to transport halfway across the continent to the markets of Zanzibar. Having found the new ruler of the upper Congo, Stanley negotiated an agreement with Tippu Tip to allow him to build his final river station just below Stanley Falls (which prevented vessels sailing further upstream).Bennett, Norman Robert. Arab vs. European: Diplomacy and war in Nineteenth-Century East Central Africa. New York: Africana Publishing Company, 1986. At the end of his physical resources, Stanley returned home, to be replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Francis de Winton, formerly a British Army officer. ==See also== *Belgian Congo *French Congo *Portuguese Congo *Scramble for Africa *Congo Reform Association *Congo Free State *Congo river steamers ==References== ==External links== * Oasis Kodila Tedika et Francklin Kyayima Muteba, The sources of growth in DRC before independence.

The union amended the earlier act of the Union of Krewo (1385) and confirmed the Ostr√≥w Agreement (1392). Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, became fully in charge of the Lithuanian affairs, while W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, King of Poland, reserved the rights of an overlord. After the death of Vytautas, Lithuania was to be ruled by W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço or his legal heir. The union is generally seen as strengthening of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union. ==Background== Both W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, King of Poland, and Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, sought to renew the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union, which had existed since 1385. In 1399, Queen Jadwiga of Poland died due to childbirth complications, leaving W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço king of a foreign land and without an heir. If Polish nobles forced W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço to abdicate the throne, he would return to Lithuania demanding the throne of the Grand Duke. Vytautas would be forced either to return to Duchy of Trakai or launch another civil war. The same year Vytautas suffered a major defeat in the Battle of the Vorskla River against the Golden Horde and faced rebellions in the Principality of Smolensk, Republic of Pskov, and Velikiy Novgorod. ==Provisions== Negotiations began in late December 1400 in Hrodna. The union was signed in three separate acts: one by W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço (the original of which did not survive), another by Vytautas and the Lithuanian nobles (in Vilnius on 18 January 1401), and the third by the Polish Royal Council (in Radom on 11 March 1401). It is significant that for the first time the Lithuanian nobles issued a political act in their own name, not merely as witnesses to the Grand Duke's treaties. Vytautas was instituted as the Grand Duke of Lithuania (magnus dux) while his cousin W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, King of Poland, retained the rights of an overlord (supremus dux). The union legalized Vytautas status as an actual ruler of Lithuania and his right to use title of \\"grand duke\\" (what he was doing before but not in correspondence with Poland)Frost 2015, p. 93 However, this independence was to be temporary ‚Äì after Vytautas' death Lithuania was to be governed by W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço or his legal heir and will become part of the kingdom and crown of Poland. The Polish and Lithuanian nobles agreed not to elect a new King of Poland without consulting each other. At the time neither W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço nor Vytautas had heirs, but each hoped to sire legitimate sons that would inherit both the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy (eventually it would be Jogaila who would succeed in this). Vytautas also renewed his vows to Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, to the crown, kingdom, and inhabitants of Poland and promised to aid them when necessary. ==Aftermath and evaluations== The renewed alliance stabilized the situation, allowing Vytautas to launch an offensive against the Teutonic Knights and to initiate the first Samogitian uprising. Eventually, the joint Polish‚ÄìLithuanian forces achieved a decisive victory against the Knights in the Battle of Grunwald in 1410. The treaty has been variously interpreted by Lithuanian and Polish historians. Some argued that it was a diplomatic failure on Vytautas' part, as the union blocked the path to his possible coronation as King of Lithuania. Others saw it as a concession by the Poles when their plan to fully incorporate the Grand Duchy into the Kingdom of Poland failed. A third school of thought considered the union to be a mutual compromise: Lithuania abandoned plans for full independence, while Poland abandoned plans for full incorporation of Lithuania into a unitary state. Some more recent academic works tend not to overestimate the union's importance and see it as mere codification of the actual Polish‚ÄìLithuanian relations that had existed since 1392. Other researchers emphasize the fact that Lithuanians were included into election of new Polish monarch. With the death of Jadwiga Poland lost last ruler with a hereditary right to rule, Polish nobles reserved for themselves right to elect new king upon his death, even the rights of his possible son with newly married Anne of Cejle, granddaughter of Kazimierz III, were not guaranteed. Inclusion of Lithuanian nobles into future election can be seen as inclusion of them into \\"community of the realm\\" (communitas regni) embodied in Poland by the notion of \\"the crown of the kingdom of Poland\\" (corona regni Poloniae).Frost 2015, p. 96 ==References== == Bibliography == * Category:1400s in law Vilnius and Radom Category:15th century in Poland Category:1401 in Europe Category:15th century in Lithuania Category:1400s treaties Category:Personal unions ","title":"Pact of Vilnius and Radom"},{"id":"1270088","text":"The Kills are an English-American rock duo formed by American singer Alison \\"VV\\" Mosshart and English guitarist Jamie \\"Hotel\\" Hince. They are signed to Domino Records. Their first four albums, Keep On Your Mean Side, No Wow, Midnight Boom, and Blood Pressures, all reached the UK album chart. Their fifth and most recent studio album, Ash & Ice, was released in 2016 and reached the UK Top 20 album chart. ==Career== The Kills in October 2016 Mosshart and Hince both played in other bands before they formed The Kills in 2001. Mosshart was previously the vocalist of punk rock band Discount, while Hince featured in rock bands such as Scarfo and Blyth Power. Mosshart encountered Hince when her band was touring England, where Hince was \\"staying in the flat upstairs from where [she] was staying\\" in London. Mosshart insisted on forming a band with Hince and \\"really persisted, and eventually we started writing and he encouraged me\\". Hince supplied her with a four-track tape recorder and insisted she write music as well as lyrics while on tour with her band. The two continued to exchange music ideas by sending each other tapes. Discount disbanded in 2000, and Mosshart moved to London in the same year. Before settling on a name, Mosshart and Hince performed as \\"VV\\" and \\"Hotel\\", respectively, Hince explaining that they \\"named each other off the top of our heads as a stupid romantic ode to the pop art scene\\". The duo opted for The Kills as it \\"sounded like a band that could exist in any decade\\". Using the ideas on the tapes, Mosshart and Hince began to write minimalist songs with the aid of a drum machine. In 2001 they showcased their new songs on a demo tape; however, the pair shunned approaches from major record labels. Recording as VV and Hotel, they contributed the song \\"Restaurant Blouse\\" to the compilation If the Twenty-First Century Did Not Exist, It Would Be Necessary to Invent It. Shortly after this they recorded their debut release, the Black Rooster EP, which saw release on British indie label Domino Records and was picked up for distribution by Dim Mak Records in the United States. Following international touring, they entered Toe Rag Studios, where the White Stripes had recorded their album Elephant, to record their debut album Keep on Your Mean Side, mostly on 8-track, in just 2 weeks. Distributed in the US and UK by Rough Trade Records, the album was similar in style to the EP, veering from the Velvets-esque stomp of \\"Wait\\" to the noisy, dirty garage punk blues of \\"Fuck the People\\" and dark psychedelia of \\"Kissy Kissy\\". The record was well received by the music press, though the White Stripes comparisons would not go away. Mosshart chain-smoked while singing, rarely speaking to the audience; at a New York City show following the ban on public smoking, Mosshart went on stage with three bottles of water, lit up a cigarette and proceeded to smoke constantly from the first song to the last note of the set. In 2004 Mosshard and Hince bought a house together in Dalston. In 2005, \\"Monkey 23\\" was used in \\"De battre mon c≈ìur s'est arr√™t√©\\", where it played over the closing credits. It was also featured in season three of Peaky Blinders. In 2006, \\"Kissy Kissy\\" was used in Children of Men, where it was described in-universe as \\"a blast from the past all the way back to 2003, that beautiful time when people refused to accept the future is just around the corner\\". Their second album, No Wow, was released by Domino Records on February 21, 2005. Featuring an artier, less \\"guitar rock\\" sound, the record embraced post punk influences and sounded even more stripped down than Keep on Your Mean Side. Originally written to be performed on a Moog, the band was forced to change directions and record it primarily using a guitar after Hince's Moog broke and couldn't be repaired before entering the studio. A 40-minute DVD documentary was included with a limited number of copies and features interview, performance and on the road footage shot on tour. The first single, \\"The Good Ones\\", from No Wow, was released on February 7, 2005 and reached number 23 in the UK Singles Chart, which is their highest charting single in that chart to date. Mosshart features in the title track of Placebo's album Meds. She also features on the Primal Scream album Riot City Blues. Midnight Boom was released in March 2008. Its music was used throughout many American TV shows, including 90210. A big selection of songs from the album were featured in the hit television series Gossip Girl, and also, their track \\"Sour Cherry\\" was featured as the soundbed for Season Two's official trailer. \\"Sour Cherry\\" was also featured in the Footloose trailer, as well as in the 2008 rom-com The House Bunny. The album also picked up new mainstream success for the band with various TV performances in the UK; appearing on Later With Jools Holland, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, T4, The Album Chart Show, Sound, Live From Abbey Road, and From The Basement. On October 21, 2008, \\"Cheap and Cheerful\\" was used on the show House during the opening scene of the episode \\"Lucky Thirteen\\". \\"Cheap and Cheerful\\" can also be heard on the NHL 09 soundtrack. It was later used in the Fendi's TV commercial for the \\"Fan di Fendi\\" perfume (2010). \\"U.R.A. Fever\\" was played during a love scene in the 2010 movie The Losers. Only the chorus of the song is played. \\"U.R.A. Fever\\" was heard in the 2010 film Welcome to the Rileys, as well as appearing on its soundtrack. It is also heard on the 2011 movie Catch .44 (partially) and the 2012 movie Detention. The bonus song \\"Night Train\\" appeared in the 2009 remake of the film Friday The 13th and in the 2012 American drama film What Maisie Knew, along with \\"Hook and Line\\". The song \\"What New York Used to Be\\" was used in the film Push. Mosshart at the 2016 Festival Internacional de Benic√†ssim On September 11, 2009, it was announced on the band's MySpace page that they had begun work on their fourth studio album though no release date had been set. \\"Black Balloon\\" from their \\"Black Balloon EP\\", released in 2009, was featured in the Season 2 episode of The Good Wife, \\"Net Worth\\", on February 15, 2011. The Kills' fourth studio album, Blood Pressures, was released in April 2011. A video for the first single from Blood Pressures, \\"Satellite\\", was released on February 9, 2011, followed By Future Starts Slow, Baby Says, The Last Goodbye, and Wild Charms on September 2012. \\"Future Starts Slow\\" was also used in a promotion for the episode \\"The Wait Is Almost Over\\" of hit TV series True Blood (season 4). The song from the same album \\"Damned If She Do\\" was also used in the promotion of The Vampire Diaries third season, and has received positive reviews from the fans. \\"The Last Goodbye\\" was used in the 2012 film Just Like A Woman, starring Sienna Miller. \\"Future Starts Slow\\" appears in the trailer for the 2012 action thriller film Contraband, a March 2012 episode of the Vampire Diaries, in a promotion and, beginning with the second episode, was used as the theme music for the 2012 TV series Political Animals (miniseries), was used towards the end of episode 16, season 2 of Person of Interest and featured in the season 1 finale of Altered Carbon. They contributed a cover of \\"Dreams\\" to the Fleetwood Mac tribute compilation \\"Just Tell Me That You Want Me\\", set for release on August 14, 2012 through Hear Music and Concord Music Group. In September the duo published the photo book Dream & Drive, created together with the photographer Kenneth Capello. It coincided with an exhibition at the Milk Gallery, London. Paris Spleen: The Kills Live at L'Olympia, the film of their show from November 2011 was released on 20 September 2013 in partnership with the French clothing company Equipment. The Kills were set to go on a small American tour with Queens of the Stone Age in December 2013. In the same year, Hince suffered an injury to his left hand when a car door closed on it. He lost the use of his middle finger and had to have a number of operations. This resulted in change in playing style and equipment. Shortly after the announcement of the shows, the band's record label, Domino Records confirmed that the duo were working on their next album. In May 2014, Mosshart said that they were looking for a new sound and that this new album will be completely different from the others. She noted that \\"You never know what's going to happen with a record when you're writing. It could be done all of a sudden in two months, or it could take another year. You get on these tangents, and you find new directions. You kind of follow the scent wherever it's taking you. Sometimes it takes a long time. Sometimes it's fast as hell.\\" The Kills were part of the line-up for Coachella 2016. The Kills fifth studio album, Ash & Ice, was released on 3 June 2016. A new single titled \\"Doing It to Death\\" was released in March 2016. The duo embarked on a lengthy world tour, but were forced to cancel European festival dates after Mosshart suffered with pneumonia.. In 2017 the group were the support act for Guns N' Roses during the UK leg of their world tour. ==Influences== The band has cited Royal Trux, PJ Harvey, the Velvet Underground, Sleater-Kinney, Fugazi, The Clash, The Rolling Stones, Nirvana, Pixies, Bikini Kill, and Sonic Youth as influences. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Keep on Your Mean Side (2003) * No Wow (2005) * Midnight Boom (2008) * Blood Pressures (2011) * Ash & Ice (2016) ==ReferencesThe Kills at Dim Mak Records Category:American indie rock groups Category:British indie rock groups Category:Rock music duos Category:Rough Trade Records artists Category:Third Man Records artists ","title":"The Kills"},{"id":"1270090","text":"Academic administration is a branch of university or college employees responsible for the maintenance and supervision of the institution and separate from the faculty or academics, although some personnel may have joint responsibilities. Some type of separate administrative structure exists at almost all academic institutions. Fewer institutions are governed by employees who are also involved in academic or scholarly work. Many senior administrators are academics who have advanced degrees and no longer teach or conduct research. ==Key responsibilities== Key broad administrative responsibilities (and thus administrative units) in academic institutions include: * Admissions * Supervision of academic affairs such as hiring, promotion, tenure, and evaluation (with faculty input where appropriate); * Maintenance of official records (typically supervised by a registrar); * Maintenance and audit of financial flows and records; * Maintenance and construction of campus buildings and grounds (the physical plant); * Safety and security of people and property on the campus (often organized as an office of public safety or campus police); * Supervision and support of campus computers and network (information technology). * Fundraising from private individuals and foundations (\\"development\\" or \\"advancement\\") * Research administration (including grants and contract administration, and institutional compliance with federal and state regulations) * Public affairs (including relations with the media, the community, and local, state, and federal governments) * Student services such as disability services, career counselling and library staff. ==Administrative titles== The chief executive, the administrative and educational head of a university, depending on tradition and location, may be termed the university president, the provost, the chancellor (the United States), the vice-chancellor (many Commonwealth countries), principal (Scotland and Canada), or rector (Europe, Russia, Asia the Middle East and South America). An administrative executive in charge of a university department or of some schools, may be termed a dean or some variation. The chief executive of academic establishments other than universities, may be termed headmaster or head teacher (schools), director (used to reflect various positions ranging from the head of an institution to the head of a program), or principal, as used in primary education. ==Administrative communication== Like other professional areas, academic administration follows a specialized and often highly abstract terminology. This terminology often depends on that used in military strategy (as in Strategic Planning) and business management (including Public Relations).Richard Utz, \\"Against Adminspeak,\\" Chronicle of Higher Education, June 24, 2020. ==By country== Academic administrations are structured in various ways at different institutions and in different countries. ===Australia=== Full-time tertiary education administrators emerged as a distinct role in Australia from the mid-1970s, as institutions sought to deal with their increasing size and complexity, along with a broadening of their aspirations.Conway, Maree. 'Defining administrators and new professionals.' PERSPECTIVES, VOLUME 4, NUMBER 1, 2000: pp. 4-5. As the professionalism of tertiary administrators has developed, there has been a corresponding push to recognise the uniqueness and validity of their role in the academic environment.GORNALL, L. (1988) \`New professionals‚Äô: changes and occupational roles in higher education. perspectives, 3(2), pp. 44-49.Conway, Maree and Ian Dobson. 'Fear and Loathing in University Staffing: The Case of Australian Academic and General Staff.' Journal of Higher Education Management and Policy, Volume 15, No. 3,: pp. 123.133. , general staff comprised over half the employees at Australian universities. Around 65% of these are female. There has recently been a shift in the preferred nomenclature for non-academic staff at Australian universities, from \\"general staff\\" to \\"professional staff\\". It has been argued that the changing in role of the professional staff has been due to the changing work that they are performing, as professional staff assist students with technology. The overarching body for all staff working in administration and management in Australia is the Association for Tertiary Education Management. ===United Kingdom=== ====Administrative structures==== The structures for administration and management in higher education in the United Kingdom vary significantly between institutions. Any description of a general structure will therefore not apply to some or even many institutions, and therefore any general statement of structures may be misleading. Not all UK universities have the post of Registrar. The Director of Finance may report to the Registrar or directly to the Vice-Chancellor, whilst other senior posts may or may not report to the Registrar. This next tier of senior positions might include Directors of Human Resources, Estates, and Corporate Affairs. The Academic Registrar is often included in this next tier. Their role is mostly to accomplish student-facing administrative processes such as admissions, student records, complaints, and graduation. ====Professional associations==== The overarching body for all staff working in administration and management in the UK is the Association of University Administrators. ===United States=== ====Presidents and chancellors==== In the United States, a college or university is typically supervised by a President or Chancellor who reports regularly to a Board of Trustees (made up of individuals from outside the institution) and who serves as Chief Executive Officer. Most large colleges and universities now use an administrative structure with a tier of vice presidents, among whom the Provost (or Vice President for Academic Affairs, or Academic Dean) serves as the chief academic officer. Remuneration of presidents and chancellors The ten highest- paid administrators at private colleges earn an average of about $2.5 million per year, while at public colleges the figure is $1.4 million. These figures includes both base pay and other income. ==== Deans ==== Deans may supervise various and more specific aspects of the institution, or may be CEOs of entire campuses. They may report directly to the president or chancellor. The division of responsibility among deans varies widely among institutions; some are chiefly responsible for clusters of academic fields (such as the humanities or natural sciences) or whole academic units (such as a graduate school or college), while others are responsible for non-academic but campus- wide concerns such as minority affairs. In some cases a provost supervises the institution's entire academic staff, occupying a position generally superior to any dean. In other instances the Dean of a College may be the equivalent to a Provost or Vice Chancellor or Vice President for Academic Affairs. Below deans in the administrative hierarchy are heads of individual academic departments and of individual administrative departments. These heads (commonly styled \\"chairs\\" or \\"directors\\") then supervise the faculty and staff of their individual departments. ==== Departmental Chairs ==== The Chair of a department is typically a tenured or at least tenure-track faculty member, supported by administrative staff. ==== Administrative staff ==== All levels of the university have administrative staff, reporting to Chancellors, Presidents, Provosts, Deans, and Departmental Chairs. ==References== ==Further reading== * Why Are Campus Administrators Making So Much Money? and The $7 Million University President, by Lawrence S.

The first acts were signed in 1432 during the Lithuanian Civil War of 1431‚Äì1435. The acts confirmed the Union of Vilnius and Radom (1401). The Union established Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis as the Grand Duke of Lithuania and re- established W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço's seniority and dynastic interest in Lithuania. ==Background== After death of Vytautas in 1430, the Lithuanian nobles unilaterally selected ≈†vitrigaila as the new Grand Duke. This violated the terms of the Union of Horod≈Ço of 1413, where Lithuanians promised not to elect a new Grand Duke without an approval from Poland. The Polish nobles were outraged and demanded that ≈†vitrigaila acknowledged fealty to his brother W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, King of Poland. ≈†vitrigaila refused and the conflict grew into a civil war. In September 1431, Poland and Lithuania signed a two- year truce; however, on 31 August 1432, a group of nobles deposed ≈†vitrigaila in support of Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis, brother of Vytautas. Sigismund resumed policy of union with Poland. A Polish delegation, sent to Lithuania by W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço and led by Zbigniew Ole≈õnicki, Bishop of Krak√≥w, pronounced Sigismund as the Grand Duke of Lithuania for life on 30 September 1432. Sigismund swore loyalty to Poland in an act, signed in Grodno (Hrodna) on 25 October 1432. W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço confirmed both acts on 3 January 1433. Sigismund had to reconfirm his loyalty to these provisions on 20 January 1433, 27 February 1434, 6 December 1437 and 31 October 1439. Collectively all these acts are known as the Union of Grodno. ==Provisions== The Union established a clear lord‚Äìvassal relationship between W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço (styled dominus nostra and frater seniorus) and Sigismund (styled supremus princeps ad tempora vitae). The act in essence confirmed the Union of Vilnius and Radom (1401) and granted Sigismund the same rights as Vytautas enjoyed during his reign. After Sigismund's death, Lithuania was to return to the King of Poland; thus the Union of Grodno abandoned provisions of the Union of Horod≈Ço (1413), which envisioned that the Lithuanian nobility would elect their new Grand Duke with consent of the Polish nobles. Sigismund promised not to seek the Lithuanian crown and his son Michael ≈Ωygimantaitis had no dynastic rights to the throne of Lithuania. Thus Jagie≈Ç≈Ço's dynastic interest in Lithuania was re-established, which is explained by the fact that in 1413 he had no children, while in 1432 he had two sons (W≈Çadys≈Çaw III and Casimir IV). Sigismund also made territorial concessions to Poland, which received contested Podolia and part of Volhynia (except for Lutsk and Volodymyr- Volynskyi). After Sigismund's death entire Volhynia was to unconditionally pass to Poland. ==Aftermath== In 1435 Sigismund won the decisive Battle of Pabaiskas thus ending the Lithuanian Civil War of 1431‚Äì1435. He established himself in Lithuania and began distancing from pro-Polish policies. Sigismund took advantage of dynastic struggle between the Jagiellons and the Habsburg dynasty over the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1437‚Äì1438 and attempted to form an anti-Polish coalition with the Teutonic Knights. The plan failed and Sigismund was forced to re-confirm the Union of Grodno in 1437 and 1439. Despite the declarations, after Sigismund's murder in 1440, the Lithuanians unilaterally elected Casimir IV Jagiellon as their Grand Duke. The union between Poland and Lithuania was broken until 1447, when Casimir also became King of Poland. ==References== Category:1432 in Europe Category:15th century in Lithuania Grodno Category:1430s treaties Category:15th century in Poland Category:History of Grodno ","title":"Union of Grodno (1432)"},{"id":"1270137","text":"The Act of Mielnik or Union of Mielnik was an attempt to unite the Kingdom of Poland with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1501. It was not ratified by the Lithuanian Seimas or by the Polish Sejm (see ≈Åaski's Statute). The Act of Mielnik remained just a political project. Despite the failure to unify two countries into a single state, Poland and Lithuania were under a personal union until the Union of Lublin of 1569. ==Provisions== After death of John I Albert, King of Poland, his brother Alexander Jagiellon, Grand Duke of Lithuania, became the most suitable candidate for the new king. Such a move would revive the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union, a personal union between the two states. However, Alexander's ambitions went further. The Act of Mielnik was drafted by Polish and Lithuanian diplomats on 3 October 1501 in Piotrk√≥w and confirmed on 23 October 1501 by Alexander (who was already elected as the Polish King but not yet crowned) and few members of the Lithuanian Council of Lords. On 30 October, twenty-seven Lithuanian nobles and boyars agreed to abide by the Union of Melnik. The act declared that Poland and Lithuania would be united into a single state with one ruler, one parliament (Great Sejm), one monetary system, and one army. The separate and independent position of the Grand Duke of Lithuania was eliminated, transferring the title to King of Poland. It meant that Alexander gave up his hereditary rights to the throne of the Grand Duchy. Such declaration sharply contrasted with the Union of Krak√≥w and Vilna of 1499, which envisioned the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union as an alliance of two equal partners. ==Jagiellon ambitions== Such a declaration reflected changed priorities of the Jagiellon dynasty. In Lithuania, their patrimony, the Jagiellons had hereditary rights, while in Poland they had to be elected by the nobles. Earlier Jagiellons saw Lithuania as their stronghold to ensure their power in Poland and therefore supported Lithuania's independence from Poland. However, as the Kings were educated and lived mostly in Poland, they began to focus on Polish affairs often regarding Lithuanian matters as secondary. As Jagiellons became monarchs of Kingdom of Hungary and Kingdom of Bohemia, they became interested in uniting the two countries into one, strengthening their positions for further dynastic expansion in Eastern and Central Europe. However, the Act of Melnik was not supported by Alexander's brother Vladislas II, King of Bohemia and Hungary. ==Ratification== The Act attracted only limited support among the Lithuanian nobles, chiefly voivode of Trakai Jan Jurjewicz Zabrzezi≈Ñski and Bishop of Vilnius Wojciech Tabor. Some Lithuanians hoped for Polish assistance in the Muscovite‚ÄìLithuanian Wars, especially after the defeat in the Battle of Vedrosha. Most nobles, including Grand Chancellor Miko≈Çaj Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, Bishop of Samogitia Martynas Lintfaras, regent of Navahrudak Albrecht Go≈°tautas, were against the Act. The Act required that it would be ratified by the Lithuanian Seimas. However, the war with the Grand Duchy of Moscow postponed the Seimas until 1505 and by that time Alexander himself showed much less interest in ratifying the Act. It was hoped that the Act of Melnik could be ratified by the Polish Sejm in Radom in 1505. However, the Lithuanian Seimas in Brest rejected the Act and did not authorize the Lithuanian delegates to the Sejm in Radom to discuss the Act. ==See also== *Privilege of Mielnik ==References== Category:1501 in Lithuania Category:1501 in Poland Mielnik Category:1501 treaties ","title":"Union of Mielnik"},{"id":"1270138","text":"Painting commemorating Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union; ca. 1861.

It produces a current in its secondary which is proportional to the current in its primary. Current transformers, along with voltage or potential transformers, are instrument transformers. Instrument transformers scale the large values of voltage or current to small, standardized values that are easy to handle for measuring instruments and protective relays. The instrument transformers isolate measurement or protection circuits from the high voltage of the primary system. A current transformer provides a secondary current that is accurately proportional to the current flowing in its primary. The current transformer presents a negligible load to the primary circuit. Donald G. Fink, H. Wayne Beatty (ed), Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, Eleventh Edition, Mc-Graw Hill,1978, 0-07-020974-X, pp. 10-51 - 10-57 Current transformers are the current-sensing units of the power system and are used at generating stations, electrical substations, and in industrial and commercial electric power distribution. ==Function== Basic operation of current transformer SF6 110 kV current transformer TGFM series, Russia metering equipment for three-phase 400-ampere electricity supply Zero-phase-sequence current transformer A current transformer has a primary winding, a core and a secondary winding, although some transformers, including current transformers, use an air core. While the physical principles are the same, the details of a \\"current\\" transformer compared with a \\"voltage\\" transformer will differ owing to different requirements of the application. A current transformer is designed to maintain an accurate ratio between the currents in its primary and secondary circuits over a defined range. The alternating current in the primary produces an alternating magnetic field in the core, which then induces an alternating current in the secondary. The primary circuit is largely unaffected by the insertion of the CT. Accurate current transformers need close coupling between the primary and secondary to ensure that the secondary current is proportional to the primary current over a wide current range. The current in the secondary is the current in the primary (assuming a single turn primary) divided by the number of turns of the secondary. In the illustration on the right, 'I' is the current in the primary, 'B' is the magnetic field, 'N' is the number of turns on the secondary, and 'A' is an AC ammeter. Current transformers typically consist of a silicon steel ring core wound with many turns of copper wire as shown in the illustration to the right. The conductor carrying the primary current is passed through the ring. The CT's primary, therefore, consists of a single 'turn'. The primary 'winding' may be a permanent part of the current transformer, i.e. a heavy copper bar to carry current through the core. Window-type current transformers are also common, which can have circuit cables run through the middle of an opening in the core to provide a single-turn primary winding. To assist accuracy, the primary conductor should be centered in the aperture. CTs are specified by their current ratio from primary to secondary. The rated secondary current is normally standardized at 1 or 5 amperes. For example, a 4000:5 CT secondary winding will supply an output current of 5 amperes when the primary winding current is 4000 amperes. This ratio can also be used to find the impedance or voltage on one side of the transformer, given the appropriate value at the other side. For the 4000:5 CT, the secondary impedance can be found as , and the secondary voltage can be found as . In some cases, the secondary impedance is referred to the primary side, and is found as . Referring the impedance is done simply by multiplying initial secondary impedance value by the current ratio. The secondary winding of a CT can have taps to provide a range of ratios, five taps being common. Current transformer shapes and sizes vary depending on the end user or switch gear manufacturer. Low-voltage single ratio metering current transformers are either a ring type or plastic molded case. Split-core current transformers either have a two-part core or a core with a removable section. This allows the transformer to be placed around a conductor without having to disconnect it first. Split-core current transformers are typically used in low current measuring instruments, often portable, battery-operated, and hand-held (see illustration lower right). == Use == Many digital clamp meters utilize a current transformer for measuring alternating current (AC). Current transformers are used extensively for measuring current and monitoring the operation of the power grid. Along with voltage leads, revenue-grade CTs drive the electrical utility's watt-hour meter on many larger commercial and industrial supplies. High-voltage current transformers are mounted on porcelain or polymer insulators to isolate them from ground. Some CT configurations slip around the bushing of a high-voltage transformer or circuit breaker, which automatically centers the conductor inside the CT window. Current transformers can be mounted on the low voltage or high voltage leads of a power transformer. Sometimes a section of a bus bar can be removed to replace a current transformer. Often, multiple CTs are installed as a \\"stack\\" for various uses. For example, protection devices and revenue metering may use separate CTs to provide isolation between metering and protection circuits and allows current transformers with different characteristics (accuracy, overload performance) to be used for the devices. The burden (load) impedance should not exceed the specified maximum value to avoid the secondary voltage exceeding the limits for the current transformer. The primary current rating of a current transformer should not be exceeded or the core may enter its non linear region and ultimately saturate. This would occur near the end of the first half of each half (positive and negative) of the AC sine wave in the primary and would compromise the accuracy. == Safety == Current transformers are often used to monitor high currents or currents at high voltages. Technical standards and design practices are used to ensure the safety of installations using current transformers. The secondary of a current transformer should not be disconnected from its burden while current is in the primary, as the secondary will attempt to continue driving current into an effective infinite impedance up to its insulation break-down voltage and thus compromise operator safety. For certain current transformers, this voltage may reach several kilovolts and may cause arcing. Exceeding the secondary voltage may also degrade the accuracy of the transformer or destroy it. Energizing a current transformer with an open circuit secondary is equivalent to energizing a voltage transformer (normal type) with a short circuit secondary. In the first case the secondary tries to produce an infinite voltage and in the second case the secondary tries to produce an infinite current. Both scenarios can be dangerous and damage the transformer. == Accuracy == The accuracy of a CT is affected by a number of factors including: * Burden * Burden class/saturation class * Rating factor * Load * External electromagnetic fields * Temperature * Physical configuration * The selected tap, for multi- ratio CTs * Phase change * Capacitive coupling between primary and secondary * Resistance of primary and secondary * Core magnetizing current Accuracy classes for various types of measurement and at standard loads in the secondary circuit (burdens) are defined in IEC 61869-1 as classes 0.1, 0.2s, 0.2, 0.5, 0.5s, 1 and 3. The class designation is an approximate measure of the CT's accuracy. The ratio (primary to secondary current) error of a Class 1 CT is 1% at rated current; the ratio error of a Class 0.5 CT is 0.5% or less. Errors in phase are also important, especially in power measuring circuits. Each class has an allowable maximum phase error for a specified load impedance. Current transformers used for protective relaying also have accuracy requirements at overload currents in excess of the normal rating to ensure accurate performance of relays during system faults. A CT with a rating of 2.5L400 specifies with an output from its secondary winding of twenty times its rated secondary current (usually ) and 400 V (IZ drop) its output accuracy will be within 2.5 percent. === Burden === The secondary load of a current transformer is termed the \\"burden\\" to distinguish it from the primary load. The burden in a CT metering electrical network is largely resistive impedance presented to its secondary winding. Typical burden ratings for IEC CTs are 1.5 VA, 3 VA, 5 VA, 10 VA, 15 VA, 20 VA, 30 VA, 45 VA and 60 VA. ANSI/IEEE burden ratings are B-0.1, B-0.2, B-0.5, B-1.0, B-2.0 and B-4.0. This means a CT with a burden rating of B-0.2 will maintain its stated accuracy with up to 0.2 Œ© on the secondary circuit. These specification diagrams show accuracy parallelograms on a grid incorporating magnitude and phase angle error scales at the CT's rated burden. Items that contribute to the burden of a current measurement circuit are switch-blocks, meters and intermediate conductors. The most common cause of excess burden impedance is the conductor between the meter and the CT. When substation meters are located far from the meter cabinets, the excessive length of cable creates a large resistance. This problem can be reduced by using thicker cables and CTs with lower secondary currents (1 A), both of which will produce less voltage drop between the CT and its metering devices. ===Knee-point core-saturation voltage=== The knee- point voltage of a current transformer is the magnitude of the secondary voltage above which the output current ceases to linearly follow the input current within declared accuracy. In testing, if a voltage is applied across the secondary terminals the magnetizing current will increase in proportion to the applied voltage, until the knee point is reached. The knee point is defined as the voltage at which a 10% increase in applied voltage increases the magnetizing current by 50%. For voltages greater than the knee point, the magnetizing current increases considerably even for small increments in voltage across the secondary terminals. The knee-point voltage is less applicable for metering current transformers as their accuracy is generally much higher but constrained within a very small range of the current transformer rating, typically 1.2 to 1.5 times rated current. However, the concept of knee point voltage is very pertinent to protection current transformers, since they are necessarily exposed to fault currents of 20 to 30 times rated current.Anon, Protective Relays Application Guide Second EditionThe General Electric Company Limited of England, 1975 Section 5.3 ===Phase shift=== Ideally, the primary and secondary currents of a current transformer should be in phase. In practice, this is impossible, but, at normal power frequencies, phase shifts of a few tenths of a degree are achievable, while simpler CTs may have phase shifts up to six degrees. For current measurement, phase shift is immaterial as ammeters only display the magnitude of the current. However, in wattmeters, energy meters, and power factor meters, phase shift produces errors. For power and energy measurement, the errors are considered to be negligible at unity power factor but become more significant as the power factor approaches zero. At zero power-factor, any indicated power is entirely due to the current transformer's phase error. The introduction of electronic power and energy meters has allowed current phase error to be calibrated out. ==Construction== Bar-type current transformers have terminals for source and load connections of the primary circuit, and the body of the current transformer provides insulation between the primary circuit and ground. By use of oil insulation and porcelain bushings, such transformers can be applied at the highest transmission voltages. Ring-type current transformers are installed over a bus bar or an insulated cable and have only a low level of insulation on the secondary coil. To obtain non-standard ratios or for other special purposes, more than one turn of the primary cable may be passed through the ring. Where a metal shield is present in the cable jacket, it must be terminated so no net sheath current passes through the ring, to ensure accuracy. Current transformers used to sense ground fault (zero sequence) currents, such as in a three-phase installation, may have three primary conductors passed through the ring. Only the net unbalanced current produces a secondary current - this can be used to detect a fault from an energized conductor to ground. Ring-type transformers usually use dry insulation systems, with a hard rubber or plastic case over the secondary windings. For temporary connections, a split ring-type current transformer can be slipped over a cable without disconnecting it. This type has a laminated iron core, with a hinged section that allows it to be installed over the cable; the core links the magnetic flux produced by the single turn primary winding to a wound secondary with many turns. Because the gaps in the hinged segment introduce inaccuracy, such devices are not normally used for revenue metering. Current transformers, especially those intended for high voltage substation service, may have multiple taps on their secondary windings, providing several ratios in the same device. This can be done to allow for reduced inventory of spare units, or to allow for load growth in an installation. A high-voltage current transformer may have several secondary windings with the same primary, to allow for separate metering and protection circuits, or for connection to different types of protective devices. For example, one secondary may be used for branch overcurrent protection, while a second winding may be used in a bus differential protective scheme, and a third winding used for power and current measurement. ==Special types== Specially constructed wideband current transformers are also used (usually with an oscilloscope) to measure waveforms of high frequency or pulsed currents within pulsed power systems. Unlike CTs used for power circuitry, wideband CTs are rated in output volts per ampere of primary current. If the burden resistance is much less than inductive impedance of the secondary winding at the measurement frequency then the current in the secondary tracks the primary current and the transformer provides a current output that is proportional to the measured current. On the other hand, if that condition is not true, then the transformer is inductive and gives a differential output. The Rogowski coil uses this effect and requires an external integrator in order to provide a voltage output that is proportional to the measured current. ==Standards== Ultimately, depending on client requirements, there are two main standards to which current transformers are designed. IEC 61869-1 (in the past IEC 60044-1) & IEEE C57.13 (ANSI), although the Canadian and Australian standards are also recognised. ==High voltage types == Current transformers are used for protection, measurement and control in high-voltage electrical substations and the electrical grid. Current transformers may be installed inside switchgear or in apparatus bushings, but very often free- standing outdoor current transformers are used. In a switchyard, live tank current transformers have a substantial part of their enclosure energized at the line voltage and must be mounted on insulators. Dead tank current transformers isolate the measured circuit from the enclosure. Live tank CTs are useful because the primary conductor is short, which gives better stability and a higher short-circuit current rating. The primary of the winding can be evenly distributed around the magnetic core, which gives better performance for overloads and transients. Since the major insulation of a live-tank current transformer is not exposed to the heat of the primary conductors, insulation life and thermal stability is improved. A high-voltage current transformer may contain several cores, each with a secondary winding, for different purposes (such as metering circuits, control, or protection).Protective Relays Application Guide, (The General Electric Company Limited of England, 1975) pages 78-87 A neutral current transformer is used as earth fault protection to measure any fault current flowing through the neutral line from the wye neutral point of a transformer. == See also == * Instrumentation * Transformer types * Current sensing techniques ==References== * == External links == * Introduction to Current Transformers * Testing Current Transformers Category:Electric transformers Category:Electronic test equipment ","title":"Current transformer"},{"id":"1270191","text":"Verus (died 219) was a Roman usurper.

Eisenhower, Barry Goldwater, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan.\\"Reagan picks up endorsement of former Demo governor\\", Minden Press-Herald, November 3, 1980, p. 1 ==Early life and education== Kennon was born in rural Dubberly, south of Minden, the seat of government of Webster Parish. He was the fifth child of Floyd Kennon (1871‚Äì1966), who was born the year that Webster Parish was established, and the former Annie Laura Bopp. The Kennons operated an Independent Grocers Alliance store in Minden.Minden Herald, October 12, 1934, p. 3 After Floyd Kennon's retirement, the store was managed by two sons, Francis Edward Kennon Sr., and Webb Kennon. Young Bob Kennon was an avid Boy Scout (See Scouting in Louisiana.) who attained the rank of Eagle Scout. He graduated in 1919 from Minden High School, then a comparatively new institution. Thereafter, he attended Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, where he procured numerous honors. At the end of his freshman year, he received an award for the best academic record in his class. He was captain of his company in Reserve Officers Training Corps and the vice president of the Interfraternity Council. He was on the debate team and wrote for the campus newspaper, The Daily Reveille. He earned his first letter playing center for the LSU Tigers football team. He helped to organize the university tennis team and was one of the first two people to letter in tennis at LSU, from which he graduated in June 1923. Kennon graduated from the Louisiana State University Law Center in May 1925. A month later at the age of twenty-two, he passed the bar exam. Kennon wed the former Eugenia Sentell (December 27, 1908-May 24, 2002), a graduate of Louisiana Tech University (then Louisiana Polytechnic Institute) in Ruston, who taught home economics. Descended from a prominent family in Bossier Parish, Mrs. Kennon was a sister of the Minden physician Charles Sherburne Sentell Sr. (1904‚Äì1972). She was a wonderful hostess and was able to cultivate several friendships that later played key roles in her husband's campaigns. The Kennons had three sons, Robert Jr. (born 1938), a lawyer, and Charles Sentell \\"Charlie\\" Kennon (born 1940), a physician, both in Baton Rouge, and Kenneth Wood \\"Kenwood\\" Kennon (born 1943), also a lawyer, who resides in St. Francisville in West Feliciana Parish. Kenneth Kennon is the father of author Alexandra Kennon. Dr. Charles Sentell's wife, Sallie Hutton Sentell (1917-2013), a native of Minden, was the first woman ordained as a ruling elder in the Minden Presbyterian Church. ==Municipal politics== By the time Kennon was twenty-three, he had successfully challenged Minden Mayor Connell Fort and became for a time the youngest mayor in the United States.\\"Robert F. Kennon Elected Youngest Mayor in State\\", Webster Signal-Tribune and Springhill Journal, Historical Edition, 1926 In his brief time as mayor, Kennon was elected vice president of the Louisiana Municipal Association.Kennon advertisement, Minden Press, January 4, 1952, p. 5 Under Mayor Kennon, the status of Minden was upgraded by Governor Henry Fuqua from that of town to city. Although his term was generally considered to have been successful, Kennon did not seek reelection in 1928. He was succeeded as mayor by a clothing merchant, Henry L. Bridges, who in one election would defeat a later state lieutenant governor, Coleman Lindsey. Kennon's relationship with Connell Fort did not end with the 1926 municipal election. Seven years later when Kennon was district attorney for the 26th Judicial District (Bossier and Webster parishes), Fort's son, John L. Fort (1906‚Äì1992), subsequently the long-time operator of a news stand in Minden, shot to death Abraham Brisco Nation (1886‚Äì1933), a Minden city councilman who had quarreled politically with Mayor Fort. In 1932, Fort had returned to office for a third nonconsecutive term. Nation was the father of twelve children and a foreman for the Louisiana and Arkansas Railway in Minden. John Fort was first incarcerated in Caddo Parish but then held in the Bossier Parish jail for two years. The grand jury never reported a true bill, and Kennon decided not to pursue charges against Fort despite the testimony of two eyewitnesses to the shooting, John L. Garrett and J.R. Murph, then the secretary of the city council.Earlene Mendenhall Lyle, The Minden Cemetery: A Peaceful Resting Place, June 2004, pp. 4, 67, 88\\"[John] Fort Will Be Held in Caddo Parish on Murder Charges,\\" Webster Signal-Tribune, November 14, 1933, p. 1 ==District attorney and then judge== In 1930, Kennon won the election for district attorney of Bossier and Webster parishes by defeating his fellow Democrat Arthur M. Wallace, 2,995 to 1,825.\\"Official Vote of Webster and Bossier Parishes\\", Minden Herald, September 18, 1930, p. 1 He held the position for ten years and one month. His successor as DA was his law partner, Graydon K. Kitchens Sr. (1903‚Äì1988), a native of Stamps, Arkansas who was reared in La Salle Parish, who held the seat until January 13, 1942.List of District Attorneys from Webster Parish, Webster Parish Centennial Booklet, 1971, p. 17; Graydon K. Kitchens, Jr., was from 1976 to 1996 a city, ward, and state court judge based in Minden. DA Kennon attained the rank of lieutenant colonel in the National Guard, making him one of the highest-ranked officers. Further active with the Masonic lodge, Kennon was named \\"Grand Master\\" of the organization in 1936 and cited for his long-term membership in 1986. The Kennons lived in this house (built 1940) at 813 Jefferson Street in Minden Kennon took advantage of his growing circle of influential friends and in 1940 ran for justice of the state's Second Circuit Court of Appeal, based in Shreveport. With 46 percent of the ballots, he nearly won outright in the first primary. In the Democratic runoff, he faced the incumbent judge, Harmon Caldwell Drew, a fellow resident of Minden. The Drew family, one of the first to live in Webster Parish long before its establishment, has held judicial positions in north Louisiana for five generations, including besides H. C. Drew, Richard Maxwell Drew, Richard Cleveland Drew, R. Harmon Drew Sr., and current Circuit Judge Harmon Drew Jr.. The Kennon-Drew race was vigorously contested with considerable mudslinging. Kennon won by a margin of nine thousand votes,Kennon advertisement, Minden Press, January 4, 1952, p. 5 but he did not carry either his home parish of Webster or neighboring Bossier Parish. The circuit judgeship would not become vacant until 1942. At the time in Louisiana, it was customary to allow more than a year between election and the beginning of judicial terms. As an active member of the National Guard, Kennon was soon called to duty in 1941 as colonel of the XIII Corps of the Ninth Army. He could not hence assume the circuit judgeship until he returned from duty in World War II in May 1945. Drew continued to serve as justice until Kennon returned to claim his seat, part of that time under appointment to the Louisiana Supreme Court, where he served from 1945‚Äì1947, having replaced A. T. Higgins. ==Gubernatorial race, 1948== In October 1947, Judge Kennon entered the 1948 gubernatorial primary election as a self-proclaimed candidate \\"independent of contending political faction,\\" referring to Long and anti-Long groups then organized in state politics. The Kennon platform was dedicated to \\"economy, honesty, and efficiency\\" with a \\"progressive postwar program for Louisiana, its industries, farms, roads, schools, and institutions.\\"Minden Herald, October 3, 1947, p. 11 Kennon opened his campaign on October 10 at the Webster Parish Fair. His intraparty ticket mates, all World War II veterans, included Rufus Fontenot of Crowley for secretary of state, J. David McNeill of New Orleans for attorney general, Col. Jules H. Deshotels of Kaplan for lieutenant governor, Daniel Champagne of New Orleans for state treasurer, and Allison Kolb of Baton Rouge for state auditor.Minden Herald, January 9, 1948, p. 3 In that race, Kennon spoke against ad valorem property taxes at the state level.\\"Kennon Advocates Ad Valorem Tax Death for State\\", Minden Herald, November 14, 1947, p. 1 However, Kennon was overshadowed by two better-known former governors who secured the coveted runoff positions, Earl Kemp Long and Sam Houston Jones, who carried the endorsement of the New Orleans Times-Picayune. Kennon had claimed that he, not Jones, could defeat Long.\\"Bob Kennon Says Jones, Morrison Losing Out in La.\\", Minden Herald, November 21, 1947, p. 1 A fourth candidate was U.S. Representative James H. Morrison of Hammond. Long in turn won a convincing rematch over Jones, who had unseated Long eight years earlier. None of the Kennon-endorsed candidates was elected to a statewide office. Kennon closed his primary campaign at the Minden High School auditorium\\"Kennon Rally to End First Primary Race\\", Minden Herald, January 16, 1948, p. 1 but still lost Webster Parish in the returns. ==U.S. Senate campaign, 1948== When U.S. Senator John H. Overton died in office, a special election was called to fill the seat for a two-year term extending through January 1951. Fresh from his race for governor, Kennon challenged Russell B. Long, the older son of the legendary Huey Pierce Long Jr., who not quite thirty was still a few days too young to take office at the time of the election. Kennon said state politics should be \\"reshuffled after the bad deal\\" of the Long victory in the 1948 gubernatorial race. He urged \\"mature representation\\" in the District of Columbia. The Kennon senatorial platform called for $50 per month old-age pensions, a veterans' housing program, forestry and soil conservation measures, and expansion of the Rural Electrification Administration. He also avowed that as a senator, he would work to \\"cut red tape\\" in government operations.\\"Kennon Scores One-Family Rule\\", Minden Herald, July 30, 1948, p. 1 The outcome was close, but Long prevailed, 264,143 (51 percent) to Kennon's 253,668 (49 percent). Long's plurality was hence 10,475 votes. As with the earlier gubernatorial primary, Kennon lost his own Webster Parish in the Senate race against Long, 4,096 to 2,994.Minden Herald, September 3, 1948, p. 1 Based on the Senate returns, many in the anti-Long faction began to consider Kennon once again as a possible gubernatorial candidate in 1951. After he defeated Clem S. Clarke, an oilman from Shreveport and the first Republican to seek the Senate seat from Louisiana since implementation of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1914, Russell Long served in the Senate with little opposition until he announced his retirement, effective January 1987. ==Gubernatorial matters== Later Kennon home on Pennsylvania Avenue in Minden In 1952, despite major opposition within the Democratic primary, Kennon won his party's nomination in a runoff with state District Judge Carlos Spaht of Baton Rouge, who had the backing of some of the organizers of outgoing Governor Earl Long. Kennon polled 482,302 votes (61.4 percent) to Spaht's 302,743 (38.6 percent). Spaht's running-mate for lieutenant governor was a future governor, John Julian McKeithen, then a 33-year-old state representative from Columbia in Caldwell Parish south of Monroe. McKeithen was defeated for lieutenant governor by C. E. \\"Cap\\" Barham, a state senator and an attorney from Ruston, the seat of Lincoln Parish. Barham stood to the left of Kennon politically and ran first on the intraparty ticket with U.S. Representative Hale Boggs of Louisiana's 2nd congressional district, who finished third in the gubernatorial balloting. Kennon and Boggs thereafter ran on a common ticket of convenience in 1952. Elmer David Conner (1905-1965), a farmer and businessman from Jennings in Jefferson Davis Parish, had been Kennon's unsuccessful first choice for lieutenant governor.Minden Herald, December 7, 1951, p. 1 Conner was named director of the Louisiana Department of Commerce and Industry in the Kennon administration. In the following low-turnout general election in the spring of 1952, Kennon trounced Republican Harrison Bagwell, an attorney from Baton Rouge, 118,723 (96 percent) to 4,958 (4 percent). Prior to Bagwell, the previous Republican gubernatorial candidate in Louisiana had been Etienne J. Caire, a sugar cane farmer and businessman from St. John the Baptist Parish polled 4 percent of the vote, the same as Bagwell, in Caire's challenge of Huey Pierce Long Jr., in 1928. Kennon was sworn into office as governor on May 13, 1952, by Chief Justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court John B. Fournet.Minden Herald, May 16, 1952, p. 1 As a delegate to the 1952 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Kennon led a walkout of the Louisiana delegation, most of whose members opposed the party's civil rights plank, a point that he used in his advertising for the failed gubernatorial comeback bid in the fall of 1963.Minden Press, December 2, 1963, p. 4 Governor Kennon was often said to have conducted his office as if he were instructed by a \\"civics textbook.\\"Michael L. Kurtz, \\"Gov. Robert F. Kennon: Government by the Civics Book,\\" North Louisiana History, Vol. 12 Nos. 2-3 (Spring-Summer 1981) pp. 52-61 In addition to his interest in state sovereignty, Kennon pushed to procure voting machines to all Louisiana precincts to replace paper ballots still used in some rural parishes. Such machines were designed to eliminate the periodic problem of vote-stealing. Kennon expanded Louisiana state civil service with help from the New Orleans attorney Charles E. Dunbar, who had authored the original reform measure in 1940 under the Sam Jones administration. In 1955, Kennon was named chairman of the National Governors Conference.Minden Press, December 2, 1963, p. 4 In the 1956 gubernatorial election, Kennon, ineligible to succeed himself, supported Fred Preaus, an automobile dealer from Farmerville, the seat of Union Parish in north Louisiana, who had been Kennon's highway director. Preaus also vowed a \\"strong stand on segregation.\\"Minden Herald, December 8, 1955, p. 1 Another segregationist candidate, James M. McLemore, an Alexandria businessman, however, claimed that Kennon had done little to stem pending desegregation. According to McLemore, the Kennon administration had been \\"like an ostrich with the head buried in the sand\\" and had provided \\"no leadership\\" to halt racial integration.J. M. McLemore Outlines Plan on Segregation\\", Minden Herald and Webster Review, December 22, 1955, p. 2 McLemore had finished fourth in the 1952 primary and then endorsed Kennon in the race against Judge Spaht. \\"Cap\\" Barham, meanwhile never politically close to Kennon despite their sharing of the intraparty ticket in the 1952 runoff election, sought reelection as lieutenant governor (Only governors were then term-limited in Louisiana.) on the deLesseps Story Morrison ticket. Morrison, then the mayor of New Orleans was a former law partner of Barham's 1952 ticket mate, Hale Boggs.Minden Herald and Webster Review\\", December 8, 1955 After his governorship, Kennon and his wife resided for the remainder of their lives in Baton Rouge, where he maintained a law practice. Kennon appointed his former law partner in Minden, Graydon K. Kitchens Sr., also a graduate of the LSU Law Center, to the Louisiana Tax Commission. Earl Long, however, convinced the state legislature to remove Kitchens from the panel so that Long could make his own appointment.\\"Graydon Kitchens Booted from Post by Legislature\\", Minden Herald, May 24, 1956, p. 1 Kennon also named a Minden supporter, Leland G. Mims, to a vacancy on the Webster Parish Police Jury. Mims in 1965-1967 was president of the Police Jury Association of Louisiana.\\"Mims Will Not Seek Another Term\\", Minden Press-Herald, undated 1975 article ==Third gubernatorial campaign, 1963== Kennon's term ended in the spring of 1956, and he was succeeded by his long-time political rival, Earl Long, who defeated Morrison and Kennon's endorsed choice, Fred Preaus, the former state highway director from Farmerville in Union Parish. For his lieutenant governor running-mate, Preaus chose Morrison's city council colleague, A. Brown Moore, a decorated veteran of World War II and a New Orelans lawyer and businessman. Kennon attempted without success to run for governor again in 1963. One of his early primary rivals that year, Frank Voelker Jr., former chairman of the Louisiana Sovereignty Commission, left the race to manage Kennon's campaign.The Minden Press, September 23, 1963, p. 16 Three LSU scholars described Kennon as \\"the traditional anti-Long type: respectable, business-oriented, an exponent of governmental quietism, and an advocate of 'good government' administrative reform.\\"William C. Havard, Rudolf Heberle, and Perry H. Howard, The Louisiana Elections of 1960, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Studies, 1963, p. 98 Francis Dugas, a lawyer from Thibodaux in Lafourche Parish, ran for lieutenant governor on the Kennon ticket.Lake Charles American-Press, December 3, 1963, p. 26 In a runoff contest from which Dugas was eliminated, the position went to former Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives C. C. Aycock of Franklin in St. Mary Parish. In the Democratic primary, Kennon ran fourth (127,870 votes or 14.1 percent). He was therefore eliminated from a runoff between Public Service Commissioner John ‚â†‚âàMcKeithen of Columbia in Caldwell Parish and the more liberal contender, former New Orleans Mayor deLesseps Morrison Sr. Some observers theorized that the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, which occurred two weeks before the primary election, may have weakened Kennon's prospects because Kennon had in a televised address criticized policies of both President Kennedy and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. He called the Kennedys \\"young, misguided men.\\" He indicated that he could again bolt the Democratic Party in the 1964 presidential election though as it quickly developed the Kennedy assassination changed the national political picture.\\"Kennon Indicates He Will Bolt Democratic Party Rather Than Support Kennedy\\", The Minden Press, August 26, 1963, p. 1 Kennon was weakened by the presence of the fifth-place candidate, veteran Education Superintendent Shelby M. Jackson, a strong segregationist and a native of Concordia Parish in eastern Louisiana, whose votes are believed to have come primarily at the expense of Kennon and therefore worked to deny Kennon the coveted runoff position against Morrison. Jackson was the vocal segregationist among the five candidates, as Kennon discussed \\"state sovereignty\\", which some saw as a code word for segregation. Even if half of Jackson's votes had otherwise gone to Kennon, then Kennon, and not McKeithen, would have entered the runoff with Morrison. Jackson's supporters were also believed in many cases to have been previous backers of the 1959 segregationist gubernatorial hopeful, William M. Rainach of Claiborne Parish. Another candidate in the race was former State Representative Claude Kirkpatrick from Jefferson Davis Parish, who had headed the Department of Public Works under outgoing Governor Jimmie Davis. Kirkpatrick's widow, Edith Killgore Kirkpatrick, is a native of Claiborne Parish and a past political figure in her own right. Others in the race included outgoing State Representative Louis J. Michot of Lafayette, a future education superintendent. McKeithen won the runoff and the ensuing general election. Kennon did not endorse either runoff candidate. His nephew, Edward Kennon (a son of F. E. Kennon Sr.), a Shreveport developer and a later member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission, stumped for the Roman Catholic and pro- Kennedy \\"Chep\\" Morrison, who had endorsed Kennon in the 1951-1952 election cycle after the elimination of Morrison's first choice, his former law partner, U.S. Representative Hale Boggs of New Orleans. ==Death== Kennon died in 1988 at the age of eighty-five. He and his wife, are not interred at the Minden Cemetery but in the Young Family Cemetery in Port Hudson in East Baton Rouge Parish. Tombstone of Governor and Mrs. Robert F.

The constituent databases are interconnected via a computer network and may be geographically decentralized. Since the constituent database systems remain autonomous, a federated database system is a contrastable alternative to the (sometimes daunting) task of merging several disparate databases. A federated database, or virtual database, is a composite of all constituent databases in a federated database system. There is no actual data integration in the constituent disparate databases as a result of data federation. Through data abstraction, federated database systems can provide a uniform user interface, enabling users and clients to store and retrieve data from multiple noncontiguous databases with a single query‚Äîeven if the constituent databases are heterogeneous. To this end, a federated database system must be able to decompose the query into subqueries for submission to the relevant constituent DBMSs, after which the system must composite the result sets of the subqueries. Because various database management systems employ different query languages, federated database systems can apply wrappers to the subqueries to translate them into the appropriate query languages. ==Definition== McLeod and Heimbigner\\" were among the first to define a federated database system in the mid 1980s. A FDBS is one which \\"define[s] the architecture and interconnect[s] databases that minimize central authority yet support partial sharing and coordination among database systems\\". This description might not accurately reflect the McLeod/Heimbigner definition of a federated database. Rather, this description fits what McLeod/Heimbigner called a composite database. McLeod/Heimbigner's federated database is a collection of autonomous components that make their data available to other members of the federation through the publication of an export schema and access operations; there is no unified, central schema that encompasses the information available from the members of the federation. Among other surveys,\\" practitioners define a Federated Database as a collection of cooperating component systems which are autonomous and are possibly heterogeneous. The three important components of an FDBS are autonomy, heterogeneity and distribution. Another dimension which has also been considered is the Networking Environment Computer Network, e.g., many DBSs over a LAN or many DBSs over a WAN update related functions of participating DBSs (e.g., no updates, nonatomic transitions, atomic updates). == FDBS architecture == A DBMS can be classified as either centralized or distributed. A centralized system manages a single database while distributed manages multiple databases. A component DBS in a DBMS may be centralized or distributed. A multiple DBS (MDBS) can be classified into two types depending on the autonomy of the component DBS as federated and non federated. A nonfederated database system is an integration of component DBMS that are not autonomous. A federated database system consists of component DBS that are autonomous yet participate in a federation to allow partial and controlled sharing of their data. Federated architectures differ based on levels of integration with the component database systems and the extent of services offered by the federation. A FDBS can be categorized as loosely or tightly coupled systems. * Loosely Coupled require component databases to construct their own federated schema. A user will typically access other component database systems by using a multidatabase language but this removes any levels of location transparency, forcing the user to have direct knowledge of the federated schema. A user imports the data they require from other component databases and integrates it with their own to form a federated schema. * Tightly coupled system consists of component systems that use independent processes to construct and publicize an integrated federated schema. Multiple DBS of which FDBS are a specific type can be characterized along three dimensions: Distribution, Heterogeneity and Autonomy. Another characterization could be based on the dimension of networking, for example single databases or multiple databases in a LAN or WAN. === Distribution === Distribution of data in an FDBS is due to the existence of a multiple DBS before an FDBS is built. Data can be distributed among multiple databases which could be stored in a single computer or multiple computers. These computers could be geographically located in different places but interconnected by a network. The benefits of data distribution help in increased availability and reliability as well as improved access times. ==== Heterogeneity ==== Heterogeneities in databases arise due to factors such as differences in structures, semantics of data, the constraints supported or query language. Differences in structure occur when two data models provide different primitives such as object oriented (OO) models that support specialization and inheritance and relational models that do not. Differences due to constraints occur when two models support two different constraints. For example, the set type in CODASYL schema may be partially modeled as a referential integrity constraint in a relationship schema. CODASYL supports insertion and retention that are not captured by referential integrity alone. The query language supported by one DBMS can also contribute to heterogeneity between other component DBMSs. For example, differences in query languages with the same data models or different versions of query languages could contribute to heterogeneity. Semantic heterogeneities arise when there is a disagreement about meaning, interpretation or intended use of data. At the schema and data level, classification of possible heterogeneities include: * Naming conflicts e.g. databases using different names to represent the same concept. * Domain conflicts or data representation conflicts e.g. databases using different values to represent same concept. * Precision conflicts e.g. databases using same data values from domains of different cardinalities for same data. * Metadata conflicts e.g. same concepts are represented at schema level and instance level. * Data conflicts e.g. missing attributes * Schema conflicts e.g. table versus table conflict which includes naming conflicts, data conflicts etc. In creating a federated schema, one has to resolve such heterogeneities before integrating the component DB schemas. ==== Schema matching, schema mapping ==== Dealing with incompatible data types or query syntax is not the only obstacle to a concrete implementation of an FDBS. In systems that are not planned top-down, a generic problem lies in matching semantically equivalent, but differently named parts from different schemas (=data models) (tables, attributes). A pairwise mapping between n attributes would result in n (n-1) \\\\over 2 mapping rules (given equivalence mappings) - a number that quickly gets too large for practical purposes. A common way out is to provide a global schema that comprises the relevant parts of all member schemas and provide mappings in the form of database views. Two principal approaches depend on the direction of the mapping: # Global as View (GaV): the global schema is defined in terms of the underlying schemas # Local as View (LaV): the local schemas are defined in terms of the global schema Both are examples of data integration, called the schema matching problem. === Autonomy === Fundamental to the difference between an MDBS and an FDBS is the concept of autonomy. It is important to understand the aspects of autonomy for component databases and how they can be addressed when a component DBS participates in an FDBS. There are four kinds of autonomies addressed: * Design Autonomy which refers to ability to choose its design irrespective of data, query language or conceptualization, functionality of the system implementation. Heterogeneities in an FDBS are primarily due to design autonomy. * Communication autonomy refers to the general operation of the DBMS to communicate with other DBMS or not. * Execution autonomy allows a component DBMS to control the operations requested by local and external operations. * Association autonomy gives a power to component DBS to disassociate itself from a federation which means FDBS can operate independently of any single DBS. The ANSI/X3/SPARC Study Group outlined a three level data description architecture, the components of which are the conceptual schema, internal schema and external schema of databases. The three level architecture is however inadequate to describing the architectures of an FDBS. It was therefore extended to support the three dimensions of the FDBS namely Distribution, Autonomy and Heterogeneity. The five level schema architecture is explained below. === Concurrency control === The Heterogeneity and Autonomy requirements pose special challenges concerning concurrency control in an FDBS, which is crucial for the correct execution of its concurrent transactions (see also Global concurrency control). Achieving global serializability, the major correctness criterion, under these requirements has been characterized as very difficult and unsolved. Commitment ordering, introduced in 1991, has provided a general solution for this issue (See Global serializability; See Commitment ordering also for the architectural aspects of the solution). == Five Level Schema Architecture for FDBSs == The five level schema architecture includes the following: * Local Schema is basically the conceptual model of a component database expressed in a native data model. * Component schema is the subset of the local schema that the owner organisation is willing to share with other users of the FDBS and it is translated into a common data model. * Export Schema represents a subset of a component schema that is available to a particular federation. It may include access control information regarding its use by a specific federation user. The export schema helps in managing flow of control of data. * Federated Schema is an integration of multiple export schemas. It includes information on data distribution that is generated when integrating export schemas. * External schema is extracted from a federated schema, and is defined for the users/applications of a particular federation. While accurately representing the state of the art in data integration, the Five Level Schema Architecture above does suffer from a major drawback, namely IT imposed look and feel.

The river was used to transport lumber to sawmills downstream. Later, the Victoria Railway was built along the river. The old railway bed is now a recreational trail. The river was given its name after a forest fire in the region left the river's water with an unusual colour. ==Fish species== There are three major species of fish in the river including walleye, muskie and smallmouth bass. All three tend to grow smaller than those in the nearby lakes, however they may be legally caught according to local regulations.

A youth center or youth centre, often called youth club, is a place where young people can meet and participate in a variety of activities, for example table football, association football (US soccer, UK football), basketball, table tennis, video games, occupational therapy and religious activities. Youth clubs and centres vary in their activities across the globe, and have diverse histories based on shifting cultural, political and social contexts and relative levels of state funding or voluntary action. == Young social groups == Many youth clubs are set up to provide young people with activities designed to keep them off the streets and out of trouble, and to give them a job and an interest in activity.

They share a property with pronouns, because their referents must be supplied by context; but, unlike a pronoun, they may be used with no referent‚Äîthe important part of the communication is not the thing nominally referred to by the placeholder, but the context in which the placeholder occurs. In their Dictionary of American Slang (1960), Stuart Berg Flexner and Harold Wentworth use the term kadigan for placeholder words. They define \\"kadigan\\" as a synonym for thingamajig. The term may have originated with Willard R. Espy, though others, such as David Annis, also used it (or cadigans) in their writing. Its etymology is obscure‚ÄîFlexner and Wentworth related it to the generic word gin for engine (as in the cotton gin). It may also relate to the Irish surname Cadigan. Hypernyms (words for generic categories; e.g., \\"flower\\" for tulips and roses) may also be used in this function of a placeholder, but they are not considered to be kadigans. == Examples == Placeholder words exist in a highly informal register of the English language. In formal speech and writing, words like accessory, paraphernalia, artifact, instrument, or utensil are preferred; these words serve substantially the same function, but differ in connotation. Most of these words can be documented in at least the 19th century. Edgar Allan Poe wrote a short story entitled \\"The Literary Life of Thingum Bob, Esq\\"., showing that particular form to be in familiar use in the United States in the 1840s. In Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado, W. S. Gilbert makes the Lord High Executioner sing of a \\"little list\\" which includes: > ... apologetic statesmen of a compromising kind, > Such as: What d'ye call him: Thing'em-bob, and likewise: Never-mind, > and 'St: 'st: 'st: and What's-his-name, and also You-know-who: > The task of filling up the blanks I'd rather leave to you. Some fields have their own specific placeholder terminology. For example, \\"widget\\" in economics, engineering and electronics, or \\"Blackacre\\" and \\"John Doe\\" or \\"Jane Doe\\" in law. \\"X-ray\\" was originally a placeholder name for an unexplained phenomenon. === Companies and organizations === * \\"Ace\\" and \\"Acme\\" were popular in company names as positioning words in alphabetical directories. They were generic, laudatory of whatever products they were used to promote and appeared at the beginning of most alpha-sorted lists. The Acme Corporation of cartoon fame is one placeholder example. (Acme is a regular English word from the Ancient Greek , meaning summit, highest point, extremity or peak, and thus sometimes used for \\"best\\".) * \\"Mom and Pop\\" (in the United States) are occasional placeholders for the individual owners of a generic small family-owned business * High Street (UK) or Main Street (US) for the business district of a small town or village, often contrasted as a commercial business entity against Threadneedle Street, City of London in the UK or Wall Street, New York City in America. * \\"Advent corporation\\" is a term used by lawyers to describe an as yet unnamed corporation, while legal incorporation documents are being prepared. In the case of Advent Corporation, founder Henry Kloss decided to adopt this placeholder name as the formal legal name of his new company. * \\"NewCo\\" or \\"Newco\\" is used in a similar way in the UK for an as-yet-unnamed company. * Fictional brands such as Morley are often used in television and cinema as placeholders to avoid unintended product placement. \\"Brand X\\" has been used in television advertisements as a generic brand representing any other brand than the one being advertised. * \\"XYZ Widget Company\\" has long been used in business and economics textbooks as a sample company. Also used as engraving text example on items such as plaques, trophy plates, etc. Occasionally appears on customizable promotional materials including stationery templates, business cards, advertising signage, cups, backpacks, and other \\"swag\\" samples. * \\"Contoso\\" is used as a fictional business in Microsoft's training materials. * \\"Oceanic Airlines\\" is used as a fictional airline in several films, TV programmes, and comic books, typically when it is involved in a disaster or another event with which actual airlines would prefer not to be associated. * \\"Octan\\" is used by The Lego Group as a fictional oil company. Before 1992, they used real life oil companies Shell Oil and Esso. === Computing === Placeholder names are commonly used in computing: * Foo, Bar, Baz, and Qux (and combinations thereof) are commonly used as placeholders for file, function and variable names. Foo and bar are derived from foobar. * Hacker slang includes a number of placeholders, such as frob which may stand for any small piece of equipment. To frob, likewise, means to do something to something. In practice it means to adjust (a device) in an aimless way. * Alice and Bob, alternatives for 'Person A'/'Person B' when describing processes in telecommunications; in cryptography Eve (the eavesdropper) is also added. * J. Random X (e.g. J. Random Hacker, J. Random User) is a term used in computer jargon for a randomly selected member of a set, such as the set of all users. Sometimes used as J. Random Loser for any not-very-computer-literate user. * Johnny/Jane Appleseed, commonly used as a placeholder name by Apple. ====Domain names==== Certain domain names in the format example.tld (such as example.com, example.net, and example.org) are officially reserved as placeholders for the purpose of presentation. Various example reserved IP addresses exist in IPv4 and IPv6, such as in IPv4 documentation and in IPv6 documentation. === Geographical locations === Placeholders such as Main Street, Your County, and Anytown are often used in sample mailing addresses. Ruritania is commonly used as a placeholder country. Something-stan, where something is often profanity, is commonly used as a placeholder for a Middle Eastern or South Asian country or for a politically disliked portion of one's own country. Example - Carjackastan Timbuktu, which is also a real city, is often used to mean a place that is far away, in the middle of nowhere, and/or exotic. Podunk is used in American English for a hypothetical small town regarded as typically dull or insignificant, a place that you have likely never heard of, though still in the United States. Another example is East Cupcake to refer to a generic small town in the Midwestern United States. Similarly, the boondocks or the boonies are used in American English to refer to very rural areas without many inhabitants. In New Zealand English, Woop Woops (or, alternatively, Wop-wops) is a (generally humorous) name for an out-of-the-way location, usually rural and sparsely populated. The similar Australian English Woop Woop, (or, less frequently, Woop Woops) can refer to any remote location, or outback town or district. Another New Zealand English term with a similar use is Waikikamukau (\\"Why kick a moo-cow\\"), a generic name for a small rural town. McCloy, Nicola (2006). Whykickamoocow: Curious New Zealand Place Names. New Zealand: Random House. . In British English, Bongo Bongo Land (or Bongo-bongo Land) is a pejorative term used to refer to Third World countries, particularly in Africa, or to a fictional such country. === Legal === * In ancient Roman law, the names Aulus Agerius and Numerius Negidius were used to represent the plaintiff and the defendant. The names were both wordplays, respectively meaning \\"I set in motion\\" and \\"I refuse to pay\\". The model instruction to judges for civil suits began with si paret Numerium Negidium Aulo Agerio sestertium decem milia dare oportere, meaning \\"if it appears that Numerius Negidius ought to pay Aulus Agerius ten thousand sesterces...\\". *In the United States and Canada, John Doe and the variations Jane Doe (for females) and John Roe or Richard Roe (for a second party): used in legal action and cases when the true identity of a person is unknown or must be withheld for legal reasons. Jane Roe was used for the then-unidentified plaintiff (Norma Leah McCorvey) in one of the most famous legal cases in United States history, Roe v. Wade. These parties also appear in the legal fictions of the action in ejectment, which was the usual proceeding to quiet title to real property under common law pleading. * Mopery: used in informal legal discussions as a placeholder for some infraction, when the exact nature of the infraction is not important. * Blackacre and its neighbors Whiteacre, Greenacre, Brownacre, Greyacre, Pinkacre, etc. are used as placeholders for parcels of real property, usually on Law School examinations and the several State Bar Exams. They are sometimes located in Acre County in the fictional State of Franklin. * Fnu Lnu is used by authorities to identify unknown suspects, the name being an acronym for First Name Unknown, Last Name Unknown. If a person's first name is known but not the last, they may be called \\"John Lnu\\" or \\"Fnu Doe\\", and an unidentified person may be \\"Fnu Lnu\\". For example, a former interpreter for the United States military was charged as \\"FNU LNU\\", and a mute man whose identity could not be determined was arrested and charged with burglary in Harris County, Texas under the name \\"FNU-LNU\\" (charges were later dropped because authorities could not communicate with the man). Fnu-Lnu conjunctions may also be used if the person has only a single name, as in Indonesian names. The name has been considered a source of humor when \\"Fnu Lnu\\" has been mistaken for the actual name of a person. === Medicine === * St. Elsewhere is often used as a placeholder name for any regional hospital or other care facility from which an admitted patient was referred. The medical slang is honored in the name of the 1980s television show of the same name. * GOMER (get out of my emergency room) is a name in medical slang for any patient who continually uses emergency room services for non-emergency conditions; its use is informal and pejorative. * Element names from the periodic table are used in some hospitals as a placeholder for patient names, ex. Francium Male. === Military === Often used in example names and addresses to indicate to the serviceman where to put his own details. * Tommy Atkins, the generic name for a soldier of the British Army. Also, colloquially, Bill Oddie, rhyming slang on the nickname 'squaddie'. * In the US Army and Air Force, Private (or Airman) Tentpeg and Snuffy are commonly used in examples (to explain various procedures) or cautionary tales. In the Marine Corps, Lance Corporal Schmuckatelli serves the same purpose. * In the US Coast Guard, a generic Coast Guardsman is referred to as Joe Coastie (or Jane). * In the Coast Guard, Navy, and Marines, a hypothetical member who has his act together is A.J. Squared-Away. * In the Canadian Armed Forces, the generic name for a soldier is Private/Corporal/rank Bloggins In the British Army, the fictional Loamshire Regiment is used as a placeholder to provide examples for its procedures such as addressing mail or specimen charges for violations of military law. === Numbers === * Umpteen is any annoyingly large number, as in the phrase \\"for the umpteenth time\\". * Placeholder telephone numbers are often allocated from ranges such as 555 (where +1-areacode-555-1212 is reserved in North America for directory assistance applications) to avoid generating misdialled calls to working numbers. In the United Kingdom, Ofcom has set aside a range of numbers in larger geographic area codes, as well as fictional area code 01632 (0632 having been the code for Newcastle upon Tyne until replaced by 091 in the 1980s), for dramatic use. * Common placeholders for postcodes in Canada include A1A 1A1 (a real postal code for Lower Battery Road, St. John's, Newfoundland) and K1A 0B2 (Canada Post Place in Ottawa). H0H 0H0 is reserved by Canada Post for fictional use (specifically for the mythical Santa's workshop). In the United States, the ZIP Code 90210 (from TV series Beverly Hills 90210) is frequently used. Numeric codes with repeated or sequential digits like 12345 (a General Electric plant in Schenectady, New York), or 99999-9999 (unused but in a prefix range for the vicinity of Ketchikan, Alaska) may also appear. 00000, which lies in an unused prefix range, can be used without confusion. * In computing, some magic numbers (and other uses of hexadecimal numbers) apply hexspeak to create memorable hexadecimal values. === People === * Joe Bloggs * John/Jane Doe * Joe Schmoe * Tom, Dick and Harry === Spoken and written language === * Lorem ipsum: Simulated text used to fill in for written content in a page layout design == See also == * 555 (telephone number) * Expletive attributive * Generic you * List of placeholder names by language * Nonce word * Sampo * Syntactic expletive * The Thing-Ummy Bob * Variable and attribute (research) * Filler ==References== * Espy, W., An Almanac of Words at Play (Clarkson Potter, 1979) * Flexner, S.

Smith Street and Atlantic Avenue are the neighborhood's main commercial districts. The Brooklyn High School of the Arts is in the neighborhood on Dean Street and Third Avenue. The neighborhood is part of Brooklyn Community District 2 and is served by the NYPD's 84th Precinct.84th Precinct. ==History== Boerum Hill is named for the colonial farm of the Boerum family, which occupied most of the area during early Dutch settlement. Most of the housing consists of three- story row houses built between 1840 and 1870. Despite the \\"hill\\" in the name, the neighborhood is relatively flat; some parts sit atop former marshes that bordered Gowanus Creek. In the 1950s, all the neighborhoods south of Atlantic Avenue and west of Prospect Park were known generically as South Brooklyn. Boerum Hill in particular was sometimes called \\"North Gowanus.\\" The name \\"Boerum Hill\\" was coined in early 1964 by Boerum Hill Association founder Helen Buckler, referencing the name of the colonial farmers. From the early 1970s till about 2003, Boerum Hill was populated mostly by working class and middle-class families. In recent decades, since about the late 1990s, gentrification has changed the neighborhood to one of mostly upper-class individuals, though working-class families still reside in the immediate area. In the early twentieth century, many of the buildings were run as boarding houses. Nearby was the union hall for ironworkers, who came to the city to work on bridges and skyscrapers. The north end of Smith Street was the center of New York City's Mohawk community, who came mostly from Akwesasne and Kahnawake, Mohawk reserves in Quebec, Canada. (Akwesasne extends across national boundaries into New York state.) Many of the Mohawk men were ironworkers, while their wives worked at a variety of jobs and created the community for their families. For 50 years, the Mohawk families called their neighborhood \\"Little Caughnawaga,\\" after the homeland of Kahnawake. Many families would travel back to Kahnawake in the summer.Article about Reaghan Tarbell and her documentary, To Brooklyn and Back: A Mohawk Journey, PBS, 2 November 2009, accessed June 2010 Smith Street commercial strip The Boerum Hill Historic District was first recognized and designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on November 20, 1973, after many years of advocacy by the Boerum Hill Association.

One of the members of the broader Coregonus artedi species complex of ciscoes, it is native to the Great Lakes of Canada and the United States. Its population has been declining and it has disappeared from some of its earlier haunts. The last reported population was restricted to Georgian Bay off Lake Huron in Canada. It is thought that declines in the population of this fish may be linked with the arrival of the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), in the Great Lakes. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the conservation status of this fish as \\"critically endangered\\", and possibly extinct. ==Description== Reaching a maximum recorded length of 36 cm (14 in) and a maximum recorded weight of 540 g (1 lb 3 oz), the shortnose cisco is distinguished from the other whitefishes by its thicker body (nearly circular in cross-section), short head (the source of the fish's common name), and small eye. ==Ecology== Like many Coregonus species, the shortnose cisco is poorly understood, and little is known about its breeding or life-cycle except that it spawns in the spring at the lake bottom; the oldest specimen collected was eight years of age. The fish feeds on crustaceans, molluscs, and zooplankton. ==Status== It is native to the Great Lakes, formerly occurring in Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Ontario in Canada and the United States. The IUCN considers C. reighardi to be Critically Endangered on the basis of plummeting population, caused by environmental degradation. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Province of Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources, however, consider the species already extinct, on the basis that no specimen has been collected since 1985. The species was last confirmed present in Lake Ontario in 1964, in Lake Michigan in 1974, and in Georgian Bay in 1985. Predation by the alien sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), in combination with commercial overfishing, has contributed to the fish's drastic reduction in numbers and possible extirpation. ==References== * *Division of Endangered Species.

After his parents returned to Britain, he was evacuated to Canada during the Second World War where he remained to finish his education at McGill University in Montreal. He gained experience as a local radio broadcaster and appeared on television in plays and documentaries, before returning to Britain. Returning to the UK in 1953, Allen made his film debut in Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder (1954). He subsequently appeared in character roles in many films, including Captain Clegg, The Wild Geese, The Sea Wolves, Puppet on a Chain, and Who Dares Wins. He was also the lead actor in the Associated Rediffusion adventure series Crane (1963‚Äì65) and in the BBC-1 series Brett (1971). Allen played Moriarty's deputy Colonel Sebastian Moran in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and The Return of Sherlock Holmes. He made regular appearances in ITC television series during the 1960s and early 1970s, including The Baron, The Champions, Gideon's Way and UFO (\\"Timelash\\" 1971), although he never had an ongoing role in any of these series. He made one episode of The Saint alongside Roger Moore in \\"The Man Who Could Not Die\\" broadcast July 1965 in the UK. Allen also worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company in a number of stage roles, along with many BBC productions. In 1967 he and his wife Sarah Lawson appeared together playing a married couple in the science fiction film Night of the Big Heat. He and Lawson also played husband and wife in the BBC radio series Stand By For West based on the John Creasey novels about Scotland Yard Chief Inspector Roger West. Allen's distinctive, authoritative voice was familiar across the United Kingdom, even amongst those who did not recognise him as an actor. He dubbed Leon Greene, who played Rex, in the 1968 Hammer film The Devil Rides Out. He narrated the British Government's Protect and Survive series of public information films in the 1970s; some of his lines in that production were re- recorded and sampled into the single \\"Two Tribes\\" by the band Frankie Goes to Hollywood. He was also the voiceover artist for Vic and Bob's comedy series Vic Reeves Big Night Out, The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer and Shooting Stars, and appeared in and voiced numerous commercials for house builder Barratt Homes and car manufacturers Ford and British Leyland among many others. His voice-over work led him to start up his own business, running a very successful recording studio for voice-over work. He also narrated the first series of Blackadder, and appeared in the last episode 'The Black Seal' as Edmund's nemesis, Phillip of Burgundy ‚Äì known to his enemies as 'The Hawk'. He provided the narration (the voice of Captain Star) for the 1989 children's series TUGS. Allen remained uncredited for his work, which was revealed in an interview with the show's producer Robert D. Cardona. In 2005, he became the voice of the British television channel E4, providing voiceovers for many of its idents and promotions. Some of the slogans are rather irreverent. These include: * Only we has got Six Chuffing Feet (to advertise the final series of Six Feet Under) * Paris squashed against Britney in your gaff (to advertise The Simple Life and Britney and Kevin: Chaotic back-to-back; 'gaff' is British slang for 'home') * Big Shiny Films in your Dinky Little Home (to advertise films) * Chucking Spunky Tunes in Your Tellybox (to advertise E4 Music, the channel's music television strand) * Shamelessly importing Cool Stuff (referring to shows including Lost and the aforementioned Six Feet Under) * Watch the piggies squeal! (advertising Big Brother Diary Room Uncut) In 2005, he did an altered re-recording of the Two Tribes version of the Protect and Survive narration for German cover band Welcome to the Pleasuredome, which is featured in their live performances. Also, not long before his death, he narrated parody versions of these films for Kerrang! TV. He was also the voice of the Christian O'Connell Breakfast Show on XFM, the late show on 103.2 Power FM, Hirsty's Daily Dose on Galaxy Yorkshire and briefly Virgin Radio. ==Personal life== Allen married actress Sarah Lawson in 1960, together the couple had two sons, Stephen and Stuart.https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/aug/09/guardianobituaries.film ==Death== Allen died on the morning of 28 July 2006 at age 79.Obituary in Times online, 8 August 2006 He is survived by his wife and two sons. ==Filmography== * Blackbeard the Pirate (1952) - Undetermined Role (uncredited) * Battle Circus (1953) - British Officer (uncredited) * World for Ransom (1954) - Soldier (uncredited) * Dial M for Murder (1954) - Detective Pearson * Confession (1955) - Corey * Cross Channel (1955) - Hugo Platt * King's Rhapsody (1955) - Richard's Companion in Theatre Box (uncredited) * 1984 (1956) - Inner Party Official * Wicked as They Come (1956) - Willie * The Baby and the Battleship (1956) - Mate (uncredited) * High Tide at Noon (1957) - Charles MacKenzie * The Long Haul (1957) - Joe Easy * The Mark of the Hawk (1957) - Gregory * High Hell (1958) - Luke Fulgham * The Man Who Wouldn't Talk (1958) - Jim Kennedy * Dunkirk (1958) - Sergeant on Parade Ground * Tread Softly Stranger (1958) - Paddy Ryan * I Was Monty's Double (1958) - Col.

For hockey and lacrosse, its seating capacity is 11,215. The arena opened on October 18, 1955, as the Rochester Community War Memorial. It was renovated in the mid-1990s and reopened as The Blue Cross Arena at the War Memorial, on September 18, 1998. It is home to the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League and the Rochester Knighthawks of the National Lacrosse League. ==History== Monroe Community College graduation at the Blue Cross Arena The arena was built on a downtown site as a replacement for Edgerton Park Arena, bounded by Exchange Boulevard on the west, East Broad Street on the north, the Genesee River on the east and Court Street on the south. The property was formerly the home of the Kimball Tobacco Co. and other retail buildings. Originally named the Rochester Community War Memorial, the arena opened on October 18, 1955. The building included a full stage on the south end and an exhibition hall located on the basement level. One of the members of the construction team was a young Robert Marella, who later achieved fame as professional wrestler Gorilla Monsoon. The arena's first tenant was the Rochester Royals NBA basketball team, who played their final two seasons in Rochester at this arena. They were joined by the Americans the next year, who have played in the arena for 63 consecutive seasons. On March 13, 1996, renovations to expand the arena took place, eliminating the permanent stage at the south end of the building. On July 24, 1998, Blue Cross Blue Shield and City officials announced that the name of the renovated arena would be Blue Cross Arena at the War Memorial. On September 18, 1998, the arena reopened to the public during a formal ribbon cutting/rededication ceremony. DeWolff Partnership Architects completed the project as Architects of Record with Rossetti Architects in a consultant relationship. C.E. DeWolff, Senior Partner of DeWolff Partnership, Geno Rossetti of Rossetti Architects, were Design Associates who collaborated on features of the design.City of Rochester Agreement 021363 June 28, 1995 and AIA Doc. C141 September 15, 1995 In 2018, the city terminated the arena management contract with long term operator SMG who had been running the arena since 2000. In July 2018, the city reached an agreement with Pegula Sports and Entertainment, owners of the Americans, Buffalo Sabres and Buffalo Bills and operators of KeyBank Center in Buffalo to operate the arena beginning on August 1, 2018. Shortly after the Pegula takeover the arena received updates of a new center scoreboard, a new ribbon board at the stage end of the arena and enhancements to the audio and video equipment. There are plans for expansion along the Exchange Boulevard side of the arena that will make room for additional office space and improved locker room facilities as well as planned upgrades to the bathrooms, new concessions and a restaurant. Blue Cross Arena's portable stage, which measures 80 feet deep by 80 feet wide, is said to be deeper than, and is nearly the same size as, the proscenium stage at Radio City Music Hall across the state in New York City. ==Notable events== Wrestlers gather on the floor of the Blue Cross Arena at the start of the 46th NYSPHSAA Wrestling Championships on March 8, 2008. The first event at the facility was a public trade show held in the exhibition hall and featured such famous Rochester-based companies as Eastman Kodak, Haloid (now Xerox), Bausch & Lomb, General Railway Signal and Rochester Products. It hosted the 1956 NBA All-Star Game, the two-month finals of the American Bowling Congress tournament in both 1956 and 1966. A semifinal game and the final game of the ECAC Upstate-Southern Region Tournament, an NCAA Division I men's college basketball tournament organized by the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), took place at the War Memorial in 1978; the tournament champion received an automatic bid to the 1978 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. World Wrestling Entertainment has run many shows at the arena. Most notably several television taping and a Pay Per View event. In 1990, at a television taping, Mr. Perfect won the Intercontinental title from The Texas Tornado In 1994, Diesel (Kevin Nash) beat Razor Ramon for the Intercontinental title On July 28, 2007, the CIFL Championship Game was held in the arena. It was the first arena football game played in the venue since the Rochester Brigade folded in 2003. Local high school basketball games are played here, most notably the New York State Public High School Section V (5) Championships at the end of each season. Additionally, the arena is the home of high school cheerleading championships each year. The arena also hosts college basketball, and Section V hockey and wrestling. On Saturday and Sunday, March 8‚Äì9, 2008, the Blue Cross Arena played host to the 46th NYSPHSAA Wrestling Championships, just the second time the annual interscholastic event has been held in the Rochester area. The arena attendance record of 11,650 was set December 3, 2003 when Syracuse University defeated St. Bonaventure University in men's basketball. St. Bonaventure has hosted one of its home games in Rochester every year since 2002. In 2016, the arena hosted the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastics Champions. On May 18, 2019, the arena held their first MMA event UFC Fight Night: dos Anjos vs. Lee. In addition to sporting events, the arena hosts a wide variety of entertainment events, including live concerts, ice shows and the circus. The Rolling Stones played here in a concert that lasted only 7 minutes on November 1, 1965. Led Zeppelin played to a standing room audience concert on September 11, 1971Democrat and Chronicle The Grateful Dead's performance, on November 5, 1977, was recorded and later released as a live album, entitled Dick's Picks Volume 34. Part of the Grateful Dead's performance on September 2, 1980 is included as bonus tracks on Dick's Picks Volume 21. The band performed at the arena ten times between 1973 and 1985. Footage from Phish's documentary Bittersweet Motel, was filmed here on December 11, 1997. ===Ice hockey=== Amerks vs the Binghamton Senators in 2005 Aside from the Rochester Americans, who play their home games in the arena, the Blue Cross Arena has played host to several notable ice hockey events and games. On November 12, 2003, the Buffalo Sabres and the defending Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils played the first National Hockey League regular season game in the venue. The game was made possible by then Sabres owner Tom Golisano, who hails from Rochester, and featured two Rochester natives: Brian Gionta of the Devils and Rory Fitzpatrick of the Sabres. It ended in a 2‚Äì2 tie. A second regular season game was held at the arena on October 26, 2005, with the Sabres falling to the Washington Capitals, 3‚Äì2 with 8,552 in attendance. On March 23, 2006, Atlantic Hockey, an NCAA Division I Men's ice hockey league, announced that its league tournaments in 2007, 2008, and 2009 would be held at the Blue Cross Arena. 2007 was the first time the tournament was held at a neutral site. The league continued to hold their tournament there each year through 2018 when it then moved to Buffalo's LECOM Harborcenter. Additionally, the 2007 NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey East Regional was held at the Blue Cross Arena. Attendance was low due to high ticket prices and distance from large Division I programs. The Rochester Institute of Technology men's hockey team has played periodic regular-season games at Blue Cross Arena instead of at their smaller on-campus rink, due to the large capacity. Every year, the Blue Cross Arena hosts regular season Section V high school hockey games and the Section V Basketball championship. ==See also== * Edgerton Park Arena ==References== ==External links== * Category:1955 establishments in New York (state) Category:American Basketball Association (2000‚Äìpresent) venues Category:Arena football venues Category:Atlantic Hockey Tournament Category:Basketball venues in New York (state) Category:College ice hockey venues in the United States Category:Continental Basketball Association venues Category:Former National Basketball Association venues Category:Gymnastics venues in New York (state) Category:Indoor arenas in New York (state) Category:Indoor ice hockey venues in New York (state) Category:Indoor lacrosse venues in the United States Category:Indoor soccer venues in New York (state) Category:Mixed martial arts venues in New York (state) Category:Pegula Sports and Entertainment Category:Professional wrestling venues in New York (state) Category:Rochester Americans Category:Rochester Knighthawks Category:Rochester Royals Category:St. Bonaventure Bonnies basketball Category:Sports venues in Rochester, New York Category:Sports venues completed in 1955 Category:The Basketball League venues Category:Wrestling venues in New York (state) ","title":"Blue Cross Arena"},{"id":"1270309","text":"Reichenbach an der Fils is a town in the Esslingen district in Baden- W√ºrttemberg in southern Germany. ==History== Reichenbach was mentioned for the first time in 1268.

Together with Ivan Me≈°troviƒá (1883‚Äì1962), he was the most prominent of Yugoslav sculptors of his day. ==Biography== Rosandiƒá was born in the Dalmatian city of Split, Austria-Hungary, the son of a stoneworker. His family name, Rosandiƒá originates from Podgora a small coastal village in Southern Dalmatia about 70 km south of Split. During the early years in Split, Rosandiƒá learnt to carve in wood as well as stone and was much inspired by the younger Me≈°troviƒá who had moved there from Otavice. Both sculptors studied overseas before returning to Split, Rosandiƒá touring Italy and exhibiting in Milan in 1906 and Belgrade in 1912. Something of their parallel development and underlying rivalry can be understood from their respective projects to combine sculpture and architecture. Both constructed a mausoleum, Rosandiƒá for the Petrinoviƒá family (Supetar, on the island of Braƒç off Split) and Me≈°troviƒá to the Raƒçiƒá family (Cavtat, south of Dubrovnik). Each exhibit the influence of Dalmatian history, but while Me≈°troviƒá's mausoleum is based on the principle of simplicity, Rosandiƒá richly ornamented his building with a blend of Gothic and Renaissance motifs to express a more national character. Statue of Stone Thrower (1935), National Museum of Serbia With the outbreak of World War I, Rosandiƒá left for London where he exhibited at the Grafton Galleries in 1917 and later in Brighton and Edinburgh. During World War II, Rosandiƒá settled in Belgrade. He was interned by the German occupation forces during the war, but was later released through the intervention of Dragomir Jovanoviƒá. Rosandiƒá later testified at the Belgrade Process. Rosandiƒá was a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1948. He founded a prominent school in Belgrade known as the \\"Master Workshop\\". Amongst the many artists and public personalities that frequented the workshop was Henry Moore, during his exhibition in Belgrade in March 1955. In his maturity, Rosandiƒá executed two of his greatest masterpieces: the pair of stone statues of a man struggling with a horse, which flank the entrance to the Federal Parliament building in Belgrade (today Parliament of Serbia), and a massive stone frieze of figures for a monument in Subotica, Vojvodina, Serbia (1952). Many of his bronze projects at this time were cast in the Vo≈ædovac foundry and other works by his hand can be found at the Toma Rosandiƒá Memorial Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade.

Scholars agree that the termination of the demilitarisation of the Black Sea was Gorchakov's greatest accomplishment but add that he stayed too long as foreign minister. == Early life and career == Gorchakov was born at Haapsalu, Governorate of Estonia, and was educated at the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum, where he had the poet Alexander Pushkin as a school-fellow. He became a good classical scholar, and learned to speak and write in French with facility and elegance. Pushkin in one of his poems described young Gorchakov as Fortune's favoured son, and predicted his success.–°–∞–π—Ç –ú–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ñ–æ–Ω–¥–∞ –∫–∞–Ω—Ü–ª–µ—Ä–∞ –ì–æ—Ä—á–∞–∫–æ–≤–∞ On leaving the lyceum Gorchakov entered the foreign office under Count Nesselrode. His first diplomatic work of importance was the negotiation of a marriage between the grand duchess Olga and the crown prince Charles of Wurttemberg. He remained at Stuttgart for some years as Russian minister and confidential adviser of the crown princess. He foretold the outbreak of the revolutionary spirit in Germany and Austria, and was credited with counselling the abdication of Ferdinand in favour of Francis Joseph. When the German Confederation was re-established in 1850 in place of the parliament of Frankfurt, Gorchakov was appointed Russian minister to the diet. It was here that he first met Prince Bismarck, with whom he formed a friendship which was afterwards renewed at St Petersburg. The emperor Nicholas found that his ambassador at Vienna, Baron Meyendorff, was not a sympathetic instrument for carrying out his schemes in the East. He therefore transferred Gorchakov to Vienna, where the latter remained through the critical period of the Crimean War. Gorchakov perceived that Russian designs against Turkey, which was supported by Britain and France, were impracticable, and he counselled Russia to make no more useless sacrifices, but to accept the basis of a pacification. At the same time, although he attended the Paris conference of 1856, he purposely abstained from affixing his signature to the treaty of peace after that of Count Orlov, Russia's chief representative. For the time, however, he made a virtue of necessity, and Alexander II, recognising the wisdom and courage which Gorchakov had exhibited, appointed him minister of foreign affairs in place of Count Nesselrode.–†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ ‚Äî –∏–¥–µ–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–æ—Ç–∏–∑–º–∞.–ò–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤ –ê. –ê. ¬´–†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è –Ω–µ —Å–µ—Ä–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è, –†–æ—Å—Å–∏—è —Å–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥–æ—Ç–∞—á–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è¬ª // –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è –ª–∏–Ω–∏—è, 12.03.2014 == Minister of foreign affairs == Not long after his accession to office, Gorchakov issued a circular to the foreign powers in which he announced that Russia proposed, for internal reasons, to keep herself as free as possible from complications abroad, and he added the now historic phrase, La Russie ne boude pas; elle se recueille ('Russia is not sulking, she is composing herself'). During the January Uprising in Poland, Gorchakov rebuffed the suggestions of Britain, Austria and France for assuaging the severities employed in quelling it, and he was especially acrid in his replies to Earl Russell's despatches. The Prussian support was assured by the Alvensleben Convention. In July 1863 Gorchakov was appointed Chancellor of the Russian Empire, expressly in reward for his bold diplomatic attitude towards an indignant Europe. The appointment was hailed with enthusiasm in Russia.–≠–°–ë–ï/–ì–æ—Ä—á–∞–∫–æ–≤ A rapprochement now began between the courts of Russia and Prussia, and in 1863, Gorchakov smoothed the way for the occupation of Holstein by German troops. That seemed equally favourable to Austria and Prussia, but it was the latter power that gained all the substantial advantages. When conflict arose between Austria and Prussia in 1866, Russia remained neutral and permitted Prussia to reap the benefits arising from the conflict and establish its supremacy in Germany. In 1867 Russia and the United States concluded the sale of Alaska, a process which had begun as early as 1854 during the Crimean War. Gorchakov was not against the sale but always advocated for careful and secret negotiations, seeing the eventuality of the sale but not the immediate necessity. When the Franco-German War of 1870-1871 broke out, Russia argued for the neutrality of Austria. An attempt was made to form an anti-Prussian coalition, but it failed because of the cordial understanding between the German and the Russian chancellors. In return for Russia's service in preventing Austrian support being given to France, Gorchakov looked to Bismarck for diplomatic support on the Eastern Question, and he received an instalment of the expected support when he successfully denounced the Black Sea clauses of the Treaty of Paris (Treaty of London (1871)). That was justly regarded by him as an important service to his country and one of the triumphs of his career, and he hoped to obtain further successes with the assistance of Germany. However, the cordial relations between the cabinets of St Petersburg and Berlin did not last much longer. Pushkin's doodle representing Alexander Gorchakov In 1875, Bismarck was suspected of having designs to again attack France, and Gorchakov let him know, in a way that was not meant to be offensive but roused his indignation that Russia would oppose any such scheme. The tension thus produced between the two statesmen was increased by the political complications of 1875‚Äì1878 in Southeastern Europe, which began with the Herzegovian insurrection and culminated at the Congress of Berlin. Gorchakov hoped to use the complications of the situation in such a way as to recover, without war, the portion of Bessarabia ceded by the treaty of Paris, but he soon lost control of events, and the Slavophile agitation produced the Russo-Turkish campaign of 1877-78. The Peace of San Stefano, drafted by Gorchakov, Alexander Nelidov, and Nikolai Ignatiev. redrew Ottoman boundaries to further Russia's economic and strategic plans. A key goal was control of the port city of Batumi on the eastern shore of the Black Sea, in addition to several strategic points in the Caucasus. Most important Bulgaria was greatly enlarged to serve as the dominant power in the Balkans, and be under Russian control. France, Germany and Austria objected and radically reduced Russia's gains at the Berlin Congress (13 June to 13 July 1878). Gorchakov was honored as first plenipotentiary but he left to the second plenipotentiary, Count Shuvalov, not only the task of defending Russian interests but also the responsibility and odium for the concessions which Russia had to make to Britain and Austria. He had the satisfaction of seeing the lost portion of Bessarabia restored to Russia but at the cost of greater sacrifices than he anticipated. On the whole Russia was humiliated again. Gorchakov considered the treaty the greatest failure of his official career. He continued to hold the post of foreign minister, but lived chiefly abroad, with Dmitry Milyutin taking responsibility for foreign affairs. ==Later life== Gorchakov resigned formally in 1882 and was succeeded by Nicholas de Giers. He died at Baden-Baden and was buried at the family vault in Strelna Monastery. == Assessment == Prince Gorchakov devoted himself mostly to foreign affairs but also took some part in the great internal reforms of Alexander II's reign: for example he submitted four projects of emancipation reform and also presented to analysis of the foreign experience of various reforms to Alexander II.see. –í. –õ–æ–ø–∞—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ –ì–æ—Ä—á–∞–∫–æ–≤, –ñ–ó–õ, –ú. 2004 As a diplomat, he displayed many brilliant qualities: adroitness in negotiation, incisiveness in argument and elegance in style. His statesmanship, though marred occasionally by personal vanity and love of popular applause, was far- seeing and prudent. In the latter part of his career, his main object was to raise the prestige of Russia by undoing the results of the Crimean War, and it may fairly be said that he greatly succeeded. ==See also== * Internationalization of the Danube River ==References== == Bibliography == * Clark, Chester W. \\"Prince Gorchakov and the Black Sea Question, 1866 A Russian Bomb that did not Explode.\\" American Historical Review (1942) 48#1: 52-60. online * Golicz, Roman, \\"The Russians shall not have Constantinople: English Attitudes to Russia, 1870‚Äì1878\\", History Today (November 2003) 53#9 pp 39-45. * Hauner, Milan. \\"Central Asian geopolitics in the last hundred years: a critical survey from Gorchakov to Gorbachev.\\" Central Asian Survey 8.1 (1989): 1-19. * Jelavich, Barbara.

She is a canonical name of Brazilian Modernism, one of the great female poets in the Portuguese language, and is widely considered the best female poet from Brazil, though she combatted the word poetess because of gender discrimination. She traveled in the Americas in the 1940s, visiting the United States, Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile. In the summer of 1940 she gave lectures at the University of Texas, Austin. She wrote two poems about her time in the capital of Texas, and a long (800 lines) very socially aware poem \\"USA 1940\\", which was published posthumously. As a journalist her columns (cr√¥nicas, or chronicles) focused most often on education, but also on her trips abroad in the western hemisphere, Portugal, other parts of Europe, Israel, and India (where she received an honorary doctorate). As a poet, her style was mostly neosymbolist and her themes included ephemeral time and the contemplative life. Even though she was not concerned with local color, native vernacular, or experiments in (popular) syntax, she is considered one of the most important poets of the second phase of the Brazilian Modernism, known for nationalistic vanguardism. As a teacher she did much to promote educational reforms and advocated the construction of children's libraries. Between 1935 and 1938 she taught at the short-lived federal-district university in Rio. ==Biography== An ink drawing of Meireles disembarking in Lisbon, by her first husband, Fernando Correia Dias. Meireles was \\"orphaned at age three and raised by her maternal grandmother\\" (Tapscott 160). As a poet, she made her debut at the age of eighteen, with Espectros (1919). It has been described as \\"an airy and vague poetry, languid and fluid, set in an atmosphere of shadows and dreams.\\" The collection of seventeen sonnets dealt with various historical personages. Although her next collections included lyrics in free verse, she still preferred traditional forms and symbolism. Between 1919 and 1927 she contributed to the magazines √Årvore Nova and Terra do Sol. She was a key figure in the spiritual and transcendental magazine Festa. The Festa poets supported more traditional expression and universality than the futurists and avant-garde writers of S√£o Paulo, whose Modern Art Week in 1922 caused much controversy. Meireles always retained symbolist traits. Especially Portuguese poetry interested her. She visited Portugal in 1934 and lectured there on Brazilian literature at the universities of Lisbon and Coimbra. After 14 years without publishing a book of poetry, Meireles published one of her major works, Viagem [Voyage] (1939), which marked her poetic maturity. The book had received the annual Poetry Prize from the Brazilian Academy of Letters in 1938. The title refers to a spiritual journey where life and poetry join together. Meireles was a devout Catholic, but did not emphasize her religious or social stands. In the 1940s Meireles traveled widely and the sea became for her an important image. Mar Absoluto (1942) was sea poetry with the qualities of so-called pure poetry. In 1953 she participated in a symposium on the work of Gandhi, and India had a great influence on her work. She had taught herself both Hindi and Sanskrit. Romanceiro da Inconfid√™ncia (1953) was written in the style of medieval Iberian ballads. The work draws its subject from the first colonial attempt at Brazilian Independence, in Minas Gerais in 1789, and centers on the leader of the uprising, Joaquim Jos√© da Silva Xavier, who was hailed as another Jesus Christ. Girofl√™, Girofl√° (1956) was based on the author's journeys to India and Italy. Meireles was a prolific contributor to Brazilian periodicals, and for a time she served as education editor of Rio's Diario de Notic√≠as. She translated into Portuguese such diverse writers as Maeterlinck, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Anouilh, Ibsen, Tagore, Rilke, Virginia Woolf, and Pushkin. Her other works include plays and children's books. Cec√≠lia Meireles died of cancer in Rio de Janeiro on 9 November 1964, two days after her 63rd birthday. During her career Meireles was affected by many of the literary movements of her time. However, her poetry always remained intensely personal. In October 2009 she was one of the three featured authors at the Primeiro Congresso de Escritoras Brasileiras em Nova Iorque (First Congress of Brazilian Women Writers in New York) at the Centro Cultural Brasil / Brazilian Endowment for the Arts in Midtown Manhattan. ==Sources== * Karen Pe√±a, Poetry and the Realm of the Public Intellectual: The Alternative Destinies of Gabriela Mistral, Cecilia Meireles, and Rosario Castellanos (2008); * Darlene Sadlier, Imagery and Theme in the Poetry of Cec√≠lia Meireles (1983); * John Nist, The Modernist Movement in Brazil (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1967). * Raymond Sayers, \\"The Poetic Universe of Cecilia Meireles.\\" In Romance Studies Offered to Francis Rogers (1981) * Marta Peixoto, \\"The Absent Body: Female Signature and Poetic Convention in Cecilia Meireles.\\" Bulletin of Hispanic Studies 65.1 (1988). * Stephen Tapscott (Ed.), \\"Twentieth century Latin American poetry: A bilingual anthology\\" (160).

Ludy in command. ==Service history== ===Pre-World War I=== Assigned to the Atlantic Squadron, Lamson operated along the east coast and in the Caribbean from 1910-1916 participating in torpedo exercises, fleet maneuvers, and coastal patrol. Departing Key West, Florida on 7 May 1916, the destroyer arrived Dominican Republic two days later to support the Marines sent by President Woodrow Wilson to protect American interests during the Dominican revolt. She returned to Key West in mid-June before sailing on the 28th for Vera Cruz. She joined other American ships in Mexican waters, as the Mexican political situation was still in turmoil. Following her return to Key West on 11 July, Lamson operated along the east coast and in the Gulf of Mexico until the United States entered World War I. ===World War I=== During the early months of the war, she patrolled the coastline before preparing for oversea service. Arriving Ponta Delgada, Azores on 26 July 1917, the destroyer performed escort and patrol duty for the next three months. Lamson departed the Azores on 6 October for escort operations out of Brest, France. She assisted survivors of Finland on 28 October after the merchant ship had been torpedoed by a German submarine. The destroyer continued escort and patrol operations for the rest of the war, and aided in the victory of Allied forces by neutralizing the German U-boat threat to convoys. After the Armistice, Lamson departed Brest on 11 December 1918 and arrived at Charleston, South Carolina on 31 December. She decommissioned on 15 July 1919 and was sold on 21 November. ==Noteworthy commanding officers== * Lieutenant Herbert F.

The Beaver has had some of its stories being picked up by the national press. One thousand copies are published and distributed around campus every other Tuesday during term time. Articles are also published online daily. The Beaver is governed its society which is free for any LSE student to join. The paper is made up of sections News, Comment and Features in addition to its magazine Flipside. The Beaver also produces Beaver Sound, a multimedia podcast platform. ==History== Named after the school's mascot, the beaver, which was chosen \\"as representing an industrious animal with social habits\\", The Beaver newspaper was first published in its recognised format on 5 May 1949, and is one of the oldest student newspapers in the UK. The British Library of Political and Economic Science holds print and digital archives of the paper dating back to this first issue, which was christened by George Bernard Shaw, one of the LSE's founders. Since then it has gone through several makeovers, survived LSE's turbulent history and emerged to be one of the most respected and widely read student newspapers in the UK. ==News== The Beavers news section has consistently been among the strongest in UK student media, consisting of LSE, University of London and Higher Education stories from across Britain, sometimes being quoted in the national press, including The Guardian and The Telegraph. ==Comment== Comment publishes pieces discussing issues that are relevant to the LSE community, political analysis, social commentary, original cartoons, and debate. The extensive range of articles and letters featured reflects the broad readership of the paper. Contributions to the Comment section have been wide-ranging and varied, from former LSE Director Sir Howard Davies to lay students. The name of the section was changed from Opinion to Comment in 2013. ==Features== The Features section of the paper deals with international relations, politics and strategic affairs. Interviews are a quintessential part of the section, and previous interviews conducted by Taryana Odayar have been with Economics Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen; ministers such as Marcelo Neri, the former Brazilian Minister of Strategic Affairs; North Korean defector Hyeonseo Lee; Dr Mattia Romani, Managing Director for Country and Sector Economics at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; and academics such as German Historian Sonke Neitzel.

During most of its history, Transbrasil was owned by local entrepreneur Omar Fontana. Its aircraft usually featured a colorful livery, remarkably with a rainbow on the tail fin.\\"Aviation Design\\".\\" Retrieved on October 12, 2011. Transbrasil base was Brasilia International Airport in Brasilia.\\"World Airline Directory.\\" Flight International. March 30, 1985. 127.\\" Retrieved on June 17, 2009. From the 1970s and until its demise in 2002, Transbrasil was usually the third largest Brazilian airline after Varig and VASP, serving both domestic and international routes. ==History== ===The First Years as Sadia (1955‚Äì1972)=== Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont Airport in 1973 Transbrasil was born in the State of Santa Catarina as a sister company of S/A Ind√∫stria e Com√©rcio Conc√≥rdia, better known by its acronym Sadia. In 1953 Omar Fontana, one of the sons of the founder of Sadia Attilio Fontana noticed a Douglas DC-3 that remained parked at Joa√ßaba Airport, near Conc√≥rdia, the whole weekend. Omar Fontana came up with the idea of leasing the aircraft for transporting the products of Sadia to S√£o Paulo. In 1954 Sadia acquired its own Douglas DC-3 and flights became daily, having Omar as one of the crew members. However, since it was not an airline with regular schedule, it could not receive subventions from the government. In order to avoid this restriction, on January 5, 1955 he created Sadia S/A ‚Äì Transportes A√©reos. The first regular flight was operated on March 16, 1956. TransBrasil BAC 1-11 series 500 at S√£o Paulo Congonhas Airport in 1975 Sadia enlarged Conc√≥rdia Airport so that a Douglas DC-3 could operate with full load and created the first route from Conc√≥rdia to Videira, Florian√≥polis, S√£o Paulo-Congonhas. A short time later, Sadia was also operating to Londrina, Bauru, Ribeir√£o Preto and Bras√≠lia. Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante of Transbrasil at Rio Santos Dumont airport in 1975 In November 1957, Sadia established a partnership with Real Transportes A√©reos and became a feeder airline at Florian√≥polis. Whereas Linneu Gomes got 50% of the shares of Sadia, Omar Fontana became part of the board of Real, where he gained airline experience. At this time Sadia moved headquarters to S√£o Paulo and expanded services to Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont and Porto Alegre. This partnership ended in 1961 with the demise of Real and Fontana bought back the shares he had earlier sold to Gomes. In 1962 Sadia bought TASSA ‚Äì Transportes A√©reos Salvador and increased its presence in Bahia. In 1967 most of Sadia network was eligible to receive subventions from the Federal government and aiming at those subventions Sadia bought five Handley Page Dart Heralds. In 1968 Sadia joined the shuttle service () between Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont and S√£o Paulo-Congonhas airports, operated since 1959 by Varig, Cruzeiro do Sul and VASP. This service was abandoned only in 1999. The first jet airliner type to be introduced into the fleet of Sadia, a stretched BAC One-Eleven Series 500, entered into service on September 17, 1970. In 1972 the name of the airline was changed to Transbrasil S/A Linhas A√©reas and its headquarters were moved to Bras√≠lia.

By 1979, its fleet consisted only of 727-100s. * 1983 - Its first Boeing 767-200 is delivered, and Transbrasil starts its international operations, initially with charter flights - and from 1989, with regular service - to Miami, Orlando and Washington D.C.. ===Apogee and Downturn (1983‚Äì2003)=== Boeing 737-300 Transbrasil. Boeing 727-100 Transbrasil In 1990 Transbrasil fleet consisted of three 767-200, three Boeing 707 for cargo and passenger service (operated by its affiliated company, Aerobrasil) and 15 leased Boeing 737-300 and -400. In addition to domestic flights to most of the larger Brazilian cities, Transbrasil offered regular and charter service to Miami, Orlando, New York, Washington, Buenos Aires, Vienna, Amsterdam, London and even Beijing. During some time, due to discounted ticket prices and an aggressive commercial strategy Transbrasil surpassed VASP as the second largest Brazilian airline. Despite its growing market share, Transbrasil was already experiencing financial problems. In 1987 after a formal request of its chairman Omar Fontana, Brazilian government took over Transbrasil management. However, soon Fontana started to disagree with the Brazilian Air Force officers nominated to run the company and in 1989 the intervention was cancelled. After Fontana stepped out from Transbrasil management due to health issues, the company was run by his son-in-law Celso Cipriani - a former police officer with no previous experience on airline management. Cipriani tenure on Transbrasil was controversial, and he has been formally charged with fraud, embezzlement of funds and property and mismanagement since then. On January 14, 1994, Transbrasil created its regional subsidiary Interbrasil STAR to operate as feeder-carrier. Services started on July 3, 1995. In addition to the management problems, Transbrasil was also facing other difficulties, specially the reduced or no profit from its international routes, severe competition from other companies in the domestic front (specially TAM, a former air taxi company with a growing fleet) and growing expenses. By late 2001, despite several government loans, Transbrasil was amassing huge debts with several suppliers. When Shell refused to further supply fuel without payment, Transbrasil's then aging and reduced fleet was grounded on 3 December 2001. It never returned to the air, and was declared bankrupt in 2003 at the request of one of its major debtors - GE Capital Aviation Services. ===After Bankruptcy (2003‚Äì2010)=== TransBrasil planes abandoned at Bras√≠lia International Airport since 2001 On 16 September 2009 the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court began the analysis of the legality of the bankruptcy of Transbrasil. The bankruptcy was confirmed on 2 October 2009. That same year, the Public Ministry was preparing to file charges against the senior management of the company. The main accused being Celso Cipriani, who allegedly committed crimes that hastened the company's demise. In 2010, the debt which caused the bankruptcy of Transbrasil was invalidated by the Court of Justice of S√£o Paulo. ==Destinations== ==Fleet== A Transbrasil Boeing 767-200ER at John F.

The aircraft went off course, struck a hill and exploded. Probable causes are misjudgment of speed and distance, inadequate flight supervision, failure to initiate a go-around and improper operation of the engines. Of the 58 passengers and crew aboard, 3 passengers survived. *21 March 1989: Flight 801, a cargo Boeing 707-349C registration PT-TCS, flying from Manaus to S√£o Paulo-Guarulhos, crashed at the district of Vila Barros in Guarulhos, shortly before touch-down at runway 09R. That day, at 12:00 the runway was going to be closed for maintenance and the crew decided to speed up procedures to touch-down before closure (it was already 11:54). In a hurry, one of the crew members, by mistake, activated the air-dynamic brakes and the aircraft lost too much speed to have enough aerodynamic support (Stall). As a consequence the aircraft crashed at approximately 2 km from the airport. There were 25 fatalities which of these three were crew members and 22 were civilians on the accident site. As well as the 22 fatalities, there were also over 200 injured on the ground.

He was appointed to the United States Naval Academy on 20 September 1858, with the rank of acting-midshipman, the first Oregonian to receive an appointment. After graduating in 1862, completing his training on active duty, he saw action in the Civil War. Promoted to lieutenant on August 1, 1862, he commanded the gunboat McPherson (1999) in joint Army-Navy operations on the Nansemond River, and played an important role in the capture of batteries at Hill's Point in April 1863. On 2 May 1864, at the New York Navy Yard, Lamson commissioned the gunboat , a former blockade runner captured off Wilmington, North Carolina, in November 1863. He spent the next seven months commanding Gettysburg while stationed off the Cape Fear River, as part of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, capturing several ships. Lamson was in the forefront of the attacks on Fort Fisher, which stood at the entrance of the Cape Fear River protecting the approach to Wilmington. In December 1864, an attempt was made to reduce the fort by means of a \\"powder boat\\" ‚Äì in effect a floating bomb. The plan, concocted by General Benjamin F. Butler, called for the steamer to be loaded with 215 tons of gunpowder and sailed under the walls of the fort and detonated, destroying the fortifications and stunning the garrison into submission. On the night of December 23/24, the Louisiana, under Commander Alexander Rhind, was towed by , commanded by Lamson, to within 300 yards of the fort. Rhind set the fuzes and he and his crew abandoned ship, and were picked up by Wilderness, which promptly sailed for safety. After 80 minutes the ship finally exploded. Unfortunately the tide and an offshore breeze had moved the Louisiana further away from the fort, and the explosion had no effect. During the second attack, on January 15, 1865, after a preliminary naval bombardment, Lamson led a landing party of sailors and marines from Gettysburg, as part of a naval force assaulting the sea face of Fort Fisher, while the army attacked the landward face. Lamson and his men were pinned down under the ramparts of the fort by enemy fire, spending the night in a ditch. However, the attack by the navy diverted enough of the defenders to make the army assault successful, and the fort was taken. Lamson's friend and fellow officer Samuel W. Preston was killed in the assault.Fletcher (2011) Lamson resigned from the Navy on July 6, 1866, and returned to Oregon, where he was appointed to be clerk of U.S. Customs. On January 9, 1895, he was reappointed lieutenant and placed on the retired list on April 15, 1895. Lamson died in Portland, Oregon, on 14 August 1903, and is buried at the River View Cemetery there. ==Namesakes== Three U.S. Navy destroyers have been named in his honor. ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * * : : Category:1838 births Category:1903 deaths Category:Union Navy officers Category:People from Burlington, Iowa Category:United States Naval Academy alumni Category:United States Navy officers Category:People of Iowa in the American Civil War Category:People of Oregon in the American Civil War Category:Burials at River View Cemetery (Portland, Oregon) Category:Oregon pioneers ","title":"Roswell Lamson"},{"id":"1270451","text":"Sch√∂nefeld may refer to: ==Places in Germany== *Sch√∂nefeld, a municipality of Brandenburg near Berlin *Leipzig-Sch√∂nefeld, a quarter of Leipzig, Saxony *Sch√∂nefeld (Beelitz), a village in the town Beelitz, Brandenburg *Sch√∂nefeld (Niederg√∂rsdorf), a village in the municipality Niederg√∂rsdorf, Brandenburg *Sch√∂nefeld (Nuthe-Urstromtal), a village in the municipality Nuthe- Urstromtal, Brandenburg ==Transportation== *Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld Airport, one of Berlin's two main airports. *Berlin Sch√∂nefeld Flughafen station, the railway station of the airport *Autobahnkreuz Sch√∂nefeld, a German road interchange between the motorways A10, A13, A113 ==See also== *Sch√∂nfeld (disambiguation) ","title":"Sch√∂nefeld (disambiguation)"},{"id":"1270453","text":"The Uwharrie Mountains ()Talk Like A Tarheel, from the North Carolina Collection's website at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The Uwharries were once a coastal mountain range; isostasy has slowly raised the eastern seabed until today they lie in the Piedmont of North Carolina over 150 miles from the coast. Formed approximately 500 million years ago by accretion along the Gondwanan tectonic plate, they are thought to have once peaked at some 20,000 feet,uwharries.com before eroding to a maximum of just over 1,100 ft. The range's high point is High Rock Mountain (1,188 feet/362 meters as measured by the NC Geodetic Survey), in southwestern Davidson County. The Uwharries lie within the Southeastern mixed forests ecoregion. They give their name to the Uwharrie National Forest. Once entirely cleared for timber and farmland, the mountains were designated a U.S. National Forest in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy. The woodlands have since returned, providing a haven for a diversity of wildlife, recreational facilities, and numerous Native American archeological sites. In 1799, the discovery of gold at the nearby Reed Gold Mine in Cabarrus County led to America's first gold rush.

The new airport is currently under construction and also to be located in Sch√∂nefeld, partly on land now occupied by the existing airport. In the north, Sch√∂nefeld adjoins to the Berlin boroughs of Tempelhof-Sch√∂neberg, Neuk√∂lln, and Treptow-K√∂penick with the localities of Lichtenrade, Gropiusstadt, Buckow, Rudow, Altglienicke, and Bohnsdorf.

Sconenfelde, then a possession held by the Lords of Selchow, is documented in the 1375 Landbuch (domesday book) of Emperor Charles IV, when he also ruled as Elector of Brandenburg. The village church, rebuilt in 1904/05 according to plans designed by Franz Heinrich Schwechten, includes a large Baroque altar. Waltersdorf and Wa√ümannsdorf also have village churches dating to the first half of the 13th century. From 1933 onwards the Henschel aircraft company moved from Johannisthal Air Field to Sch√∂nefeld and had three runways laid out next to the village. More than 14,000 warplanes were built at the site until 1945, when the premises were occupied by the Red Army. In the Gro√üziethen cemetery is a memorial to 200 prisoners of war and forced laborers who died during World War II. The Soviet Air Forces used the air field from 1946, one year later the Soviet Military Administration ordered the buildup of a civil air service supplying East Berlin.

The right includes not only visiting places, but changing the place where the individual resides or works.Kees Groenendijk, Elspeth Guild, and Sergio Carrera, Illiberal Liberal States: Immigration, Citizenship and Integration in the EU (2013), p. 206: \\"[F]reedom of movement did not only amount to the right to travel freely, to take up residence and to work, but also involved the enjoyment of a legal status characterised by security of residence, the right to family reunification and the right to be treated equally with nationals\\". Such a right is provided in the constitutions of numerous states, and in documents reflecting norms of international law. For example, Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights asserts that: * \\"Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.\\" * \\"Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.\\" Some people and organizations advocate an extension of the freedom of movement to include a freedom of movement ‚Äì or migration ‚Äì between the countries as well as within the countries. The freedom of movement is restricted in a variety of ways by various governments and may even vary within the territory of a single country. Such restrictions are generally based on public health, order, or safety justifications and postulate that the right to these conditions preempts the notion of freedom of movement. ==Common restrictions== Restrictions on international travel on people (immigration or emigration) are commonplace.Dowty, Alan. Closed Borders: the Contemporary Assault on Freedom of Movement. Yale University Press, 1989. Within countries, freedom of travel is often more limited for minors, and penal law can modify this right as it applies to persons charged with or convicted of crimes (for instance, parole, probation, registration). In some countries, freedom of movement has historically been limited for women, and for members of disfavored racial and social groups. Circumstances, both legal and practical, may operate to limit this freedom. For example, a nation that is generally permissive with respect to travel may restrict that right during time of war. Restrictions may include the following: * national and regional official minimum wage tariff barriers to labour-market entry (free movement or migration of workers); * official identity cards (internal passports, citizenship licenses) that must be carried and produced on demand; * obligations on persons to register changes of address or of partner with the state authorities; * protectionist local/regional barriers to housebuilding and therefore settlement in particular districts; * trespassing into another individual's property. * motor vehicle normative road and highway design, in which pedestrian and bicycle access is severely restricted or absent ===Freedom of movement between private properties=== In some jurisdictions, questions have arisen as to the extent to which a private owner of land can exclude certain persons from land which is used for public purposes, such as a shopping mall or a park. There is also a rule of law that a landowner whose property has no public access can be awarded an easement to cross private land if necessary to reach his own property. Conversely, public nuisance laws prevent alternate use of public streets designated for public transit from being used for block parties and playing basketball. Parents or other legal guardians are typically able to restrict the movements of minor children under their care, and of other adults who have been legally deemed incompetent to govern their own movement. Employers may legally set some restrictions on the movements of employees, and terminate employment if those restrictions are breached. ===Domestic restrictions=== Governments may generally sharply restrict the freedom of movement of persons who have been convicted of crimes, most conspicuously in the context of imprisonment. Restrictions may also be placed on convicted criminals who are on probation or have been released on parole. Persons who have been charged with crimes and have been released on bail may also be prohibited from traveling. A material witness may also be denied the right to travel Though travelling to and from countries is generally permitted (with some limitations), most governments restrict the length of time that temporary visitors may stay in the country. This can be dependent on country of citizenship and country travelled to among other factors. In some instances (such as those of refugees who are at risk of immediate bodily harm on return to their country or those seeking legal asylum), indefinite stay may be allowed on humanitarian grounds, but in most other cases, stay is generally limited. One notable exception to this is the Schengen Area, where citizens of any country in the EU generally enjoy indefinite stay in other EU countries. Furthermore, restrictions on the right to relocate or live in certain areas of a country have been imposed in several countries, most prominently China. In a child custody dispute, a court may place restrictions on the movement of a minor child, thereby restricting the ability of the parents of that child to travel with their child. ===Entrance restrictions in certain countries=== The British Government asks travelers arriving at London Stansted Airport not to destroy their travel documents, in order to be able to adjudicate their eligibility to enter the country The Visa Restrictions Index ranks countries based on the number of other countries its citizens are free to enter without visa. Most countries in the world require visas or some other form of entrance permit for non-citizens to enter their territory. Those who enter countries in defiance of regulations requiring such documentation are often subject to imprisonment or deportation.Eileen, D. (2016). Freedom of Movement. Diplomatic Law. doi:10.1093/law/9780198703969.003.0024 ===Exit restrictions in certain countries=== Most countries require that their citizens leave the country on a valid passport, travel document issued by an international organization or, in some cases, identification document. Conditions of issuance and the governments' authority to deny issuance of a passport vary from country to country. Under certain circumstances, countries may issue travel documents (such as laissez-passer) to aliens, that is, to persons other than their own citizens. Having a passport issued does not guarantee the right to exit the country. A person may be prohibited to exit a country on a number of reasons, such as being under investigation as a suspect, serving a criminal sentence, being a debtor in default, or posing a threat to national security. This applies to aliens as well. In some countries prohibition to leave may take the form of revocation of a previously issued passport. For example, the United States of America may revoke passports at will.See Haig v. Agee, Passport Act of 1926. Some countries, such as the former Soviet Union, further required that their citizens, and sometimes foreign travelers, obtain an exit visa to be allowed to leave the country. Currently, some countries require that foreign citizens have valid visas upon leaving the country if they needed one to enter. For example, a person who overstayed a visa in Czech Republic may need to obtain an exit visa. In Russia, the inconvenience goes even further as the legislation there does not formally recognize residency permits as valid visas; thus, foreign citizens lawfully residing in Russia need to obtain \\"exit-entry\\" visas in order to do a trip abroad. This, in particular, affects foreign students, whose original entry visas expire by the time they return home. Citizens of the People's Republic of China who are residents of the mainland are required to apply for exit and entry endorsements in order to enter the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau (and SAR residents require a Home Return Permit to visit the mainland). Since 2016, residents of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have been required to deposit their passports with the police. Each trip abroad must be approved by the government, which is more difficult for members of the Uyghur ethnic group. Saudi Arabia and Qatar require all resident foreigners, but not citizens, to obtain an exit visa before leaving the country. ==History== === Europe === When Augustus established the Roman Empire in 27 BC, he assumed monarchical powers over the new Roman province of Egypt and was able to prohibit senators from traveling there without his permission. However, Augustus would also allow more liberty to travel at times. During a famine in 6 AD, he attempted to relieve strain on the food supply by granting senators the liberty to leave Rome and to travel to wherever they wished.Cassius Dio, Roman History, Book LV, 26. In England, in 1215, the right to travel was enshrined in Article 42 of the Magna Carta: :It shall be lawful to any person, for the future, to go out of our kingdom, and to return, safely and securely, by land or by water, saving his allegiance to us, unless it be in time of war, for some short space, for the common good of the kingdom: excepting prisoners and outlaws, according to the laws of the land, and of the people of the nation at war against us, and Merchants who shall be treated as it is said above. In the Holy Roman Empire, a measure instituted by Joseph II in 1781 permitted serfs freedom of movement. The serfs of Russia were not given their personal freedom until Alexander II's Edict of Emancipation of 1861. At the time, most of the inhabitants of Russia, not only the serfs but also townsmen and merchants, did not have freedom of movement and were confined to their places of residence.\\"Pale of Settlement\\" === United Nations Declaration === After the end of hostilities in World War II, the United Nations was established on October 24, 1945. The new international organization recognized the importance of freedom of movement through documents such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966). Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly, reads, :The text of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State. :(2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country. Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights incorporates this right into treaty law: :(1) Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence. :(2) Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own. :(3) The above-mentioned rights shall not be subject to any restrictions except those provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order (ordre public), public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other rights recognized in the present Covenant. :(4) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country. The ICCPR entered into force for the initial ratifying states on 23 March 1976, and for additional states following their ratification. In 1999, the U.N. Human Rights Committee, which is charged with interpreting the treaty, issued its guidelines for Article 12 of the ICCPR in its \\"General Comment No. 27: Freedom of Movement\\". While the treaty sets out the freedom of movement in broad and absolute terms, part four of Article 12 of the ICCPR admits that these freedoms may be restricted for a variety of reasons in the public interest. This clause is often cited to justify a wide variety of movement restrictions by almost every country that is party to it. === COVID-19 === During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, restrictions on freedom of movement were implemented by many of the world's governments. ==Examples of free movement arrangements between countries== === European Union === European Union Freedom-of-Movement Area Within the European Union, residents are guaranteed the right to freely move within the EU's internal borders by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the European Parliament and Council Directive 2004/38/EC of 29 April 2004. Union residents are given the right to enter any member state for up to three months with a valid passport or national identity card. If the citizen does not have a travel document, the member state must afford them every facility in obtaining the documents. Under no circumstances can an entry or exit visa be required. There are some security limitations and public policy restrictions on extended stays by EU residents. For instance, a member state may require that persons register their presence in the country \\"within a reasonable and non-discriminatory period of time\\". In general, however, the burden of notification and justification lies with the state. EU citizens also earn a right to permanent residence in member states they have maintained an uninterrupted five-year period of legal residence. This residency cannot be subject to any conditions, and is lost only by two successive years absence from the host nation. Family members of EU residents, in general, also acquire the same freedom of travel rights as the resident they accompany, though they may be subject to a short-stay visa requirement. Furthermore, no EU citizen may be declared permanently persona non grata within the European Union, or permanently excluded from entry by any member state. ==== Workers ==== The freedom of movement for workers is a policy chapter of the acquis communautaire of the European Union. It is part of the free movement of persons and one of the four economic freedoms: free movement of goods, services, labour and capital. Article 45 TFEU (ex 39 and 48) states that: # Freedom of movement for workers shall be secured within the Community. # Such freedom of movement shall entail the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. # It shall entail the right, subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health: #: (a) to accept offers of employment actually made; #: (b) to move freely within the territory of Member States for this purpose; #: (c) to stay in a Member State for the purpose of employment in accordance with the provisions governing the employment of nationals of that State laid down by law, regulation or administrative action; #: (d) to remain in the territory of a Member State after having been employed in that State, subject to conditions which shall be embodied in implementing regulations to be drawn up by the Commission. # The provisions of this article shall not apply to employment in the public service.Treaty of Rome (consolidated version). EUR-Lex ===Schengen Area=== A different arrangement amongst 26 European countries, covers some but not all European Union member states together with some non-member states. The arrangement allows visa-free travel between the countries in this area, in general without border controls. A foreign national who holds a visa issued by any of these countries can travel freely within the area. === Australia and New Zealand === The Trans- Tasman Travel Arrangement between Australia and New Zealand allow citizens of each country to freely move between the two countries. The arrangements also extend to holders of permanent resident and resident return visas of Australia. === United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Isle of Man and Channel Islands === The Common Travel Area arrangements allow citizens of the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, and other British nationals resident in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, to travel freely in this area. The arrangements also extend to certain foreign nationals who hold visas issued by these countries. === Union State of Russia and Belarus === Freedom of movement between Russia and Belarus for local citizens exists similar to that which exists for British and Irish citizens within the British Isles. ==Protection of right to freedom of movement in specific countries== === Asia === ==== Burma/Myanmar ==== The military regime in Burma has been criticized for allegations of restrictions to freedom of movement. These include restrictions on movement by political dissidents, women, and migrant workers. ==== China (mainland) ==== Hongping, Shennongjia District - within a section of Hubei province closed to foreign visitorsIn the mainland of the People's Republic of China, the Hukou system of household registration makes internal migration difficult, especially for rural residents to move to urban areas. Many people move to places in which they don't have a local hukou, but local governments can restrict services like subsidized schooling, subsidized housing, and health insurance to those with local hukou. The system was used as far back as the Han Dynasty for tax collection, and more recently in the People's Republic to control urbanization. The Hukou system has also lead many municipal governments to disregard the welfare of migrant workers as measures of wellbeing and economic progress are based almost exclusively on conditions for those with a local hukou.Maurer-Fazio, M., Connelly, R., & Tran, N. T. (2015). Negative native-place stereotypes and discriminatory wage penalties in China's migrant labour markets. In Handbook of Chinese Migration: Identity and Wellbeing (pp. 71-104). No, MA: Edward Elgar Publishing, Inc. Also, Chinese citizens are allowed to go from the mainland to Hong Kong or Macau only for travel, but not for residence unless they obtain the \\"one-way permit' from Chinese authorities. Currently, the issuance of the \\"one-way permit\\" is limited to 150 per day. The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy claimed in 2000 that people in Tibet had to promise not to criticize the Chinese Communist Party before receiving official permission to leave for India or Nepal. Additionally, it alleged that people of Han descent in Tibet have a far easier time acquiring the necessary permits to live in urban areas than ethnic Tibetans do.\\"Racial Discrimination in Tibet (2000)\\". Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy. Archived from the original on 2 September 2010. ==== Hong Kong and Macau ==== As a part of the one country, two systems policy proposed by Deng Xiaoping and accepted by the British and Portuguese governments, the special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau retained separate border control and immigration policies with the rest of the PRC. Chinese nationals had to gain permission from the government before travelling to Hong Kong or Macau, but this requirement was officially abolished for each SAR after its respective handover. Since then, restrictions imposed by the SAR governments have been the limiting factor on travel. Under Basic Law of Hong Kong article 31, \\"Hong Kong residents shall have freedom of movement within the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and freedom of immigration to other countries and regions. They shall have freedom to travel and to enter or leave the Region. Unless restrained by law, holders of valid travel documents shall be free to leave the Region without special authorization.\\" ==== India ==== * Freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India though reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in the interest of the general public, for example, restrictions may be imposed on movement and travelling, so as to control epidemics. * Freedom to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India, which is subject to reasonable restrictions by the State in the interest of the general public, or for protection of the scheduled tribes because certain safeguards, as are envisaged here, seem justified to protect indigenous and tribal peoples from exploitation and coercion. ====Israel==== An internal Israeli checkpoint near the town of Bethlehem. Israeli Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, which has quasi-constitutional status, declares that \\"there shall be no deprivation or restriction of the liberty of a person by imprisonment, arrest, extradition or otherwise\\"; that \\"all persons are free to leave Israel\\"; and that \\"every Israeli national has the right of entry into Israel from abroad\\". In practice, \\"withhold departure from the country\\" orders are liberally issued by Israel courts, including on non-custodial fathers who are not in arrears in child support. In March 2012 a corruption scandal exposed the quasi-legal reality of Israeli passport control, as two officials were arrested for allegedly having taken bribes to circumvent court ordered \\"no exit\\" travel abroad bans. Freedoms of movement in Israel are not similarly protected and a source of much controversy in the Palestinian West Bank and, to a lesser extent, Gaza Strip. ==== Japan ==== The Constitution provides for the freedom of movement within the country, foreign travel, immigration, and repatriation, and the Government generally respects them in practice. Citizens have the right to travel freely both within the country and abroad, to change their place of residence, to emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily. Citizenship may be forfeited by naturalization in a foreign country or by failure of persons born with dual nationality to elect citizenship at the required age. The law does not permit forced exile, and it is not used.\\"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006\\". U.S. Department of State. 2007-03-06.

In 2015 Kuwait Airways cancelled its route between New York and London following a decision by the U.S. Department of Transportation that the airline had engaged in discrimination by refusing to sell tickets to Israeli citizens. Direct flights between the US and Kuwait are not affected by this decision as Israeli citizens are not allowed to enter Kuwait. ==== North Korea ==== Travel to North Korea is tightly controlled. The standard route to and from North Korea is by plane or train via Beijing. Transport directly to and from South Korea was possible on a limited scale from 2003 until 2008, when a road was opened (bus tours, no private cars). Freedom of Movement within North Korea is also limited, as citizens are not allowed to move around freely inside their country.United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (July 2, 2008). \\"UNHCR Freedom in the World 2008 - North Korea\\".

In August 2005, Amnesty International released an \\"appeal case\\", citing several freedom of movement restrictions including exit restriction without explanation, refusal to issue passports to political dissidents, detention, restriction from entering certain structures, denial of travel documents, and denial of nationality.Syria: Unable to Move: Freedom of Movement restricted for Human Rights Defenders (and Others)  Amnesty International The United Nations Human Rights Committee issues regular reports on human rights in Syria, including freedom of movement. There are certain restrictions on movement placed on Women, for example Syrian law now allows males to place restrictions on certain female relatives. Women over the age of 18 are entitled to travel outside of Syria, however a woman's husband may file a request for his wife to be banned from leaving the country. From July 2013, in certain villages in Syria (such as Raqqa and Deir el-Zour), ISIS no longer allow women to appear in public alone, they must be accompanied by a male relative/guardian known as a mahram. People who tried to leave ISIS territory were routinely tortured and executed.The Guardian, Double-layered Veils and Despair, 17th February 2015 ==== Palestine ==== Palestinians queue to pass through a checkpoint between neighborhoods in the city of Hebron.The restriction of the movement of Israelis and Palestinians in Israel and the West Bank by Israel and the Palestinian National Authority is one issue in the Israel-Palestine conflict. In the mid-1990s, with the implementation of the Oslo Accords and the division of the West Bank into three separate administrative divisions, Israeli freedom of movement was limited by law. Israel says that the regime of restrictions is necessary to protect Israelis both in Israel proper and in the West Bank. Checkpoints exist throughout and at entrances and exits to the West Bank that limit the movement of non-Israelis on the basis of nationality, age, and sex among other criteria.Checkpoints, Physical Obstructions, and Forbidden Roads.

On btselem.org ===Africa=== Freedom of movement laws and restrictions vary from country to country on the African continent, however several international agreements beyond those prescribed by the United Nations govern freedom of movement within the African continent. The African Charter on Human and People's Rights Article 12 outlines various forms of movement-related freedoms. It asserts: # Every individual shall have the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of a State provided he abides by the law. # Every individual shall have the right to leave any country including his own, and to return to his country. This right may only be subject to restrictions, provided for by law for the protection of national security, law and order, public health or morality. # Every individual shall have the right, when persecuted, to seek and obtain asylum in other countries in accordance with laws of those countries and international conventions. # A non-national legally admitted in a territory of a State Party to the present Charter, may only be expelled from it by virtue of a decision taken in accordance with the law. # The mass expulsion of non-nationals shall be prohibited. Mass expulsion shall be that which is aimed at national, racial, ethnic or religious groups. The ideals of the Charter are, in principle, supported by all signatory governments, though they are not rigorously followed. There have been attempts to have intellectuals recognized as having special freedom of movement rights, to protect their intellectual ideals as they cross national boundaries. Beyond the African Charter on Human and People's Rights, the Constitution of South Africa also contains express freedoms of movement, in section 21 of Chapter 2. Freedom of movement is guaranteed to \\"everyone\\" in regard to leaving the country but is limited to citizens when entering it or staying in it. Citizens also have a right to a passport, critical to full exercise of the freedom of movement internationally.Certification of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 [1996 ZACC 26], 1996 (4) SA 744, 1996 (10) BCLR 1253 (6 September 1996), Constitutional Court (South Africa) === Europe === ==== Ireland ==== In the Republic of Ireland, the Thirteenth Amendment was adopted in November 1992 by referendum in order to ensure freedom of movement in the specific circumstance of a woman traveling abroad to receive an abortion. However, with the successful repeal of the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution on the 25th of May 2018, which ensures the right to an abortion, this previous amendment is no longer necessary. ==== Italy ==== In Italy, freedom of movement is enshrined in Article 16 of the Constitution, which states: \\"Every citizen has the right to reside and travel freely in any part of the country, except for such general limitations as may be established by law for reasons of health or security. No restriction may be imposed for political reasons. Every citizen is free to leave the territory of the republic and return to it, notwithstanding any legal obligations.\\" The Svalbard area is an entirely visa- free zone. ==== Norway (Svalbard) ==== Uniquely, the Norwegian special territory of Svalbard is an entirely visa-free zone under the terms of the Svalbard Treaty. ==== Poland ==== Polish nationals holding dual citizenship are required to use Polish travel documents (a Polish passport or, within the European Union, a Polish National ID card (Dow√≥d osobisty) while travelling in the Schengen Area. Poland requires all Polish citizens (including foreign citizens who are, who can be claimed to or are suspected to hold Polish citizenship) to enter and depart Poland using Polish travel documents. ==== Russia ==== The Russian Constitution in article 27 states that \\"1. Everyone who is lawfully in the territory of the Russian Federation has the right to freely move and choose a place of stay or living. 2. Everyone may freely exit the territory of the Russian Federation. [Every] citizen of the Russian Federation may return onto the territory of the Russian Federation without hindrance.\\" Freedom of movement of Russian citizens around the country is legally limited in a number of situations, including the following: * In closed cities (mainly nuclear research centers) and border-adjacent areas. Special permits are necessary for both visiting and settling there. * In certain areas near Russia's international border. * Emergency or quarantine areas. * In the interests of justice (imprisonment, bailiff's order, arrest, undertaking not to leave during a criminal investigation etc.). * Conscription. Since the abandonment of propiska system in 1993, new legislation on registration was passed. Unlike propiska which was a permit to reside in a certain area, registration as worded in the law is merely notification. However, administrative procedures developed \\"in implementation\\" of the registration law imposed such conditions on registration which effectively made it depending on the landlord's assent. However, since landlords are often not willing to register tenants or guests in their properties, many internal migrants are prevented from performing their legal duty to register. Before 2004, it was common for police to fine those having failed to register within 3 working days at a place of stay. In 2004, the maximum permitted registration lag was raised to 90 days making prosecution practically infeasible, removing practical obstacles to free movement. Nevertheless, since registration is the primary source of one's address for legal purposes, many internal migrants still are de facto second-class citizens deprived of their right to vote, obtain a passport or driver's license etc. The Russian citizens' right to leave Russia may be legally suspended on a number of reasons including: * Having had access to classified documents while working for the state or the military, during the time when access is granted and up to 5 years afterwards. This limitation is commonly included as a provision in one's contract of employment. * In the interests of justice (imprisonment, bailiff's order, undertaking not to leave etc.). * If the person is subject to conscription. Russia does not recognize (though doesn't explicitly forbid) dual citizenship. Russian citizens possessing foreign citizenship may not enter or leave Russia on foreign travel documents. Russian citizens living abroad may get stuck in Russia if they need to obtain a passport while on visit to Russia; the legal term for issuance of a passport may be up to 4 months under some circumstances. Russian consular offices do not grant visas to foreign passport holders who are (or are suspected to be) Russian citizens. ==== United Kingdom ==== Britons have long enjoyed a comparatively high level of freedom of movement. Apart from Magna Carta, the protection of rights and liberties in this field has tended to come from the common law rather than formal constitutional codes and conventions, and can be changed by Parliament without the protection of being entrenched in a constitution. It has been proposed that a range of specific state restrictions on freedom of movement should be prohibited under a new or comprehensively amended Human Rights Act. The new basic legal prohibitions could include: road tolls and other curbs on freedom of travel and private vehicle ownership and use; personal identity cards (internal passports, citizenship licenses) that must be produced on demand for individuals to access public services and facilities; and legal requirements for citizens to register changes of address or partner with the state authorities.‚ÄúThe Legal Protection Of Democracy & Freedom: The Case For A New Written Constitution & Bill Of Rights\\", in Lewis F. Abbott, British Democracy: Its Restoration & Extension, ISR/Google Books, 2006. . === North America === ==== Canada ==== The Constitution of Canada contains mobility rights expressly in section 6 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The rights specified include the right of citizens to leave and enter the country and the right of both citizens and permanent residents to move within its boundaries. However, the subsections protect poorer regions' affirmative action programs that favour residents who have lived in the region for longer. Section 6 mobility rights are among the select rights that cannot be limited by the Charter's notwithstanding clause. Canada's Social Union Framework Agreement, an agreement between governments made in 1999, affirms that \\"All governments believe that the freedom of movement of Canadians to pursue opportunities anywhere in Canada is an essential element of Canadian citizenship.\\" In the Agreement, it is pledged that \\"Governments will ensure that no new barriers to mobility are created in new social policy initiatives.\\"Government of Canada, Social Union, News Release, \\"A Framework to Improve the Social Union for Canadians: An Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Governments of the Provinces and Territories, February 4, 1999,\\" URL accessed 20 December 2006. ==== United States ==== Freedom of movement under United States law is governed primarily by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution which states, \\"The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\\" As far back as the circuit court ruling in Corfield v. Coryell, 6 Fed. Cas. 546 (1823), freedom of movement has been judicially recognized as a fundamental Constitutional right. In Paul v. Virginia, 75 U.S. 168 (1869), the Court defined freedom of movement as \\"right of free ingress into other States, and egress from them.\\" However, the Supreme Court did not invest the federal government with the authority to protect freedom of movement. Under the \\"privileges and immunities\\" clause, this authority was given to the states, a position the Court held consistently through the years in cases such as Ward v. Maryland, 79 U.S. 418 (1871), the Slaughter-House Cases, 83 U.S. 36 (1873) and United States v. Harris, 106 U.S. 629 (1883).Duster, Michael J. \\"Criminal Justice System Reform Symposium: Note: Out of Sight, Out of Mind: State Attempts to Banish Sex Offenders.\\" Drake Law Review. 53:711 (Spring 2005).\\"Note: Membership Has Its Privileges and Immunities: Congressional Power to Define and Enforce the Rights of National Citizenship.\\" Harvard Law Review. 102:1925 (June 1989). Internationally, ¬ß 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (currently codified at 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1185), it is unlawful for a United States citizen to enter or exit the United States without a valid United States passport. ===Oceania=== ==== Australia ==== No federal Australian legislation guarantees freedom of movement within the Commonwealth of Australia. Various Australian laws restrict the right on various grounds. \\\\- No longer Active Until 1 July 2016, Norfolk Island had immigration controls separate from those of the remainder of Australia and a permit was required for Australian citizens or residents to enter.

The Artillery Brigade trained conscripts and regular personnel for wartime artillery duties. In addition, it provided weather service in the Niinisalo region, and trained most of the Finnish Defence Forces' dogs. The total strength of the brigade was some 800 conscripts and 400 regular civilian and military personnel. On 1 January 2015, it was merged with the Pori Brigade. The Artillery Brigade consisted (in 2001‚Äì2013) of the Satakunta Artillery Regiment, the Reconnaissance Battalion, the Artillery School, and the Satakunta Military Band. Every year, some 1,600 conscripts were trained by the brigade. The Satakunta Artillery Regiment fielded two cannon batteries, with equipment ranging from 122 mm light howitzers to 155 mm cannons and a support battery consisting entirely out of communications personnel and spotters. The regiment continues as a part of the Pori Brigade. The Reconnaissance Battalion fielded a heavy rocket launcher battery, a UAV battery, a headquarters battery as well as a UAV reconnaissance battery. The conscripts participated in several live-fire exercises in the nearby firing range at Pohjankangas, before the two- or three-week-long national live-fire artillery exercise held once a year in Rovaj√§rvi firing range in Lapland. In 2013, as a preliminary of the merger with the Pori Brigade, the 3rd Infantry Company was established as a part of the Reconnaissance Battalion. In 2015, the Reconnaissance Battalion was disbanded and its functions divided between Finland Proper Logistics Battalion, Satakunta Artillery Regiment and Ostrobothnia Jaeger Battalion. The Artillery School, which was a part of the Artillery Brigade, provided university-level education for future artillery officers and continuing education for artillery regular personnel.

Its fixed five-car consist was also the end of an era; the popularity of the early streamliners was their undoing, because the trains could not be lengthened or shortened to handle varying loads. It was the last streamliner built with the power car articulated with the train; future streamliners featured a matched but separable locomotive.The train was painted in a two-tone green livery, \\"Cypress Green\\" on the nose and below the window sills with \\"Cedar Green\\" above, separated by an aluminum strip. Extensive aluminum trim was applied. ==Consist== The train's fixed consist was: * Car 121: Power car including driving cab, Winton 201-A 16-cylinder engine and generator, auxiliary generator, and train heating boiler. Below the floor, the first truck was powered, but the second, articulated with the second car, was not. A fuel tank was also mounted between the trucks. * Car 122: Storage, Baggage and Mail car of which approximately half was the mail compartment. * Car 123: Coach including conductor's office, seating 56. * Car 124: Coach including restrooms, seating 60. * Car 125: Diner-Lounge-Observation including restrooms, kitchen, dining area seating 8, and observation lounge seating 20. All passenger-carrying cars were air-conditioned, with radio communication between them. Full width rubber diaphragms joined the cars, and all cars were articulated (sharing a truck with the neighboring car). == Operation == IC 121 operated the Green Diamond service between 1936-1947\\\\. The Green Diamond began each morning with an 8:55 AM departure as Train 50 from St. Louis Union Station, arriving at IC's Central Station in Chicago at 1:50 PM. The train was then turned and serviced, for a 5:00 PM return as Train 51, arriving back in St. Louis by 9:55 PM. Seven stops were made en route, and the train ran to a 4-hour 55 minute schedule, being by far the fastest of IC's three trains on that route. Wartime in 1943 added an extra 15 minutes to the schedule to cope with traffic congestion, but the train was otherwise unchanged. On September 29, 1946, with the full dieselization of all Chicago-St.Louis passenger service, the Green Diamond was changed to train Nos. 20 and 21, the reservation requirement was dropped, and the timetable no longer referred to the train as a distinct trainset. Unsurprisingly, the trainset was withdrawn from service on February 28, 1947, being replaced by a new Green Diamond, an E-unit-hauled streamliner with regular lightweight cars. The trainset was shipped to the ICRR's shops at Paducah, Kentucky, for a complete overhaul, which took two months. The train emerged still in two-tone green, but with the Green Diamond names completely removed. It re-entered service on April 27, 1947, as the Miss-Lou (MISSissippi-LOUisiana) between Jackson, Mississippi, and New Orleans, Louisiana, operating as Trains 27 and 28. It left Jackson at 6:20 AM, arriving in New Orleans at 10:20 AM; the return journey left at 6:20 PM and arrived in Jackson at 10:20 PM. The trainset was finally retired on August 8, 1950, and sold for scrap. ==See also== * Passenger train service on the Illinois Central Railroad ==Footnotes== ==References== * Clifford J.

This population occurs in Myanmar, Thailand, and Laos. It has been listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2008, as the population seriously declined and approaches the threshold for critically endangered. As per 2011, the population was thought to comprise 342 individuals, including 85 in Myanmar and 20 in Vietnam, with the largest population unit surviving in Thailand estimated at 189 to 252 individuals during 2009 to 2014. ==Taxonomy== Vratislav Maz√°k proposed Panthera tigris corbetti as a scientific name for this specific population in 1968 based on skin colouration, marking pattern and skull dimensions. It was named in honor of Jim Corbett. In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy and now recognizes the tiger populations of mainland South and Southeast Asia as belonging to the nominate subspecies P. tigris tigris. Results of a genetic study published in 2018 supported six monophyletic clades based on whole genome sequencing analysis of 32 tiger specimens. The specimens from Malaysia and Indochina appeared to be distinct from other mainland Asian populations, thus supporting the concept of six living subspecies. ==Characteristics== Young Indochinese tiger The Indochinese tiger's skull is smaller than that of the Bengal tiger; the ground colouration is darker with more rather short and narrow single stripes. In body size, it is smaller than Bengal and Siberian tigers. Males range in size from and in weight from . Females range in size from and in weight from . ==Distribution and habitat== Map showing the distribution of the Bengal tiger in South Asia (red), and the Indochinese tiger in Myanmar (yellow) The Indochinese tiger is distributed in Myanmar, Thailand and Laos. It has not been recorded in Vietnam since 1997. Available data suggest that there are no more breeding tigers left in Cambodia and China. In Myanmar, the presence of tigers was confirmed in the Hukawng Valley, Htamanthi Wildlife Sanctuary, and in two small areas in the Tanintharyi Region. The Tenasserim Hills is an important area, but forests are harvested there. In 2015, tigers were recorded by camera traps for the first time in the hill forests of Karen State. More than half of the total population survives in the Western Forest Complex in Thailand, especially in the area of the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary. This habitat consists of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests. Camera trap surveys from 2008 to 2017 in eastern Thailand detected about 17 adult tigers in an area of in Dong Phayayen‚ÄìKhao Yai Forest Complex. Several individuals had cubs. The population density in Thap Lan National Park, Pang Sida National Park and Dong Yai Wildlife Sanctuary was estimated at 0.32‚Äì1.21 individuals per . In Laos, 14 tigers were documented in Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area during surveys from 2013 to 2017 covering four blocks of about semi-evergreen and evergreen forest that are interspersed with some patches of grassland. In China, it occurred historically in Yunnan province and M√™dog County, where it probably does not survive any more today. In Yunnan's Shangyong Nature Reserve, three individuals were detected during surveys from 2004 to 2009. Results of a phylogeographic study using 134 samples from tigers across the global range suggest that the historical northwestern distribution limit of the Indochinese tiger is the region in the Chittagong Hills and Brahmaputra River basin, bordering the range of the Bengal tiger. Manas-Namdapha, Orang- Laokhowa and Kaziranga-Meghalaya are Tiger Conservation Units in northeastern India, stretching over at least across several protected areas. Tigers are also present in Pakke Tiger Reserve. In the Mishmi Hills, tigers were recorded in 2017 up to an elevation of in snow. In southeastern Tibet, tigers were photographed in Medog County during a camera trapping survey in 2018. ==Ecology and behaviour== In Thailand's Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, seven female and four male tigers were equipped with GPS radio collars between June 2005 and August 2011. Females had a mean home range of and males of . Between 2013 and 2015, 11 prey species were identified at 150 kill sites. They ranged in weight from . Sambar deer, banteng, gaur and wild boar were most frequently killed, but also remains of Asian elephant calves, hog badger, Old World porcupine, muntjac, serow, pangolin and langur species were identified. ==Threats== The primary threat to the tiger is poaching for the illegal wildlife trade. Tiger bone has been an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 1,500 years and is either added to medicinal wine, used in the form of powder, or boiled to a glue-like consistency. More than 40 different formulae containing tiger bone were produced by at least 226 Chinese companies in 1993. Tiger bone glue is a popular medicine among urban Vietnamese consumers. Between 1970 and 1993, South Korea imported of tiger bones from Thailand and from China between 1991 and 1993. Between 2001 and 2010, wildlife markets were surveyed in Myanmar, Thailand and Laos. During 13 surveys, 157 body parts of tigers were found, representing at least 91 individuals. Whole skins were the most commonly traded parts. Bones, paws and penises were offered as aphrodisiacs in places with a large sex industry. Tiger bone wine was offered foremost in shops catering to Chinese customers. Traditional medicine accounted for a large portion of products sold and exported to China, Laos and Vietnam. Between 2000 and 2011, 641 tigers, both live and dead, were seized in 196 incidents in Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and China; 275 tigers were suspected to have leaked into trade from captive facilities. China was the most common destination of the seized tigers. In Myanmar's Hukaung Valley, the Yuzana Corporation alongside local authorities has expropriated more than of land from more than 600 households since 2006. Much of the trees have been logged, and the land has been transformed into plantations. Some of the land taken by the Yazana Corporation had been deemed tiger transit corridors. These are areas of land that were supposed to be left untouched by development in order to allow the region's Indochinese tigers to travel between protected pockets of reservation land. == Conservation == Since 1993, the Indochinese tiger is listed on CITES Appendix I, making international trade illegal. China, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore and Taiwan banned trade in tigers and sale of medicinal derivatives. Manufacture of tiger-based medicine was banned in China, and the open sale of tiger-based medicine reduced significantly since 1995. Patrolling in Thailand's Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary has been intensified since 2006 so that poaching appears to have reduced, resulting in a marginal improvement of tiger survival and recruitment. In a remote region of Thailand, 3 subadult tigers were photographed in spring 2020 that are thought to be dispersing. ===In captivity=== Two tigers at Cincinnati Zoo The Indochinese tiger is the least represented in captivity and is not part of a coordinated breeding program. As of 2007, 14 individuals were recognized as Indochinese tigers based on genetic analysis of 105 captive tigers in 14 countries.

Elders were forced to speak Spanish. ==History== Acoma Pueblo Sky City aerial view A view of the Acoma Pueblo mesa from the northwest ===Origins and prehistory=== Pueblo people are believed to have descended from the Ancestral Puebloans, Mogollon, and other ancient peoples. These influences are seen in the architecture, farming style, and artistry of the Acoma. In the 13th century, the Ancestral Puebloans abandoned their canyon homelands due to climate change and social upheaval. For upwards of two centuries, migrations occurred in the area. The Acoma Pueblo emerged by the thirteenth century. However, the Acoma themselves say the Sky City Pueblo was established in the 11th century, with brick buildings as early as 1144 on the Mesa indicating as such due to their unique lack of Adobe in their construction proving their antiquity. This early founding date makes Acoma Pueblo one of the earliest continuously inhabited communities in the United States. The Pueblo is situated on a mesa, about west of Albuquerque, New Mexico. The isolation and location of the Pueblo has sheltered the community for more than 1,200 years. They sought to avoid conflict with the neighboring Navajo and Apache peoples. ===European contact=== The first mention of Acoma was in 1539. Estevanico, a slave, was the first non-Indian to visit Acoma and reported it to Marcos de Niza, who related the information to the viceroy of New Spain after the end of his expedition. Acoma was called the independent Kingdom of Hacus. He called the Acoma people encaconados, which meant that they had turquoise hanging from their ears and noses.Wagner, Henry R. 1934. Father Marcos de Niza. New Mexico Historical Review, 9 (2): 184‚Äì227.Villagr√°, Gaspar P√©rez de. 1933. History of New Mexico (transl. G Espinosa). Los Angeles: Quivira Society. Lieutenant Hernando de Alvarado of conquistador Francisco V√°zquez de Coronado's expedition described the Pueblo (which they called Acuco) in 1540 as \\"a very strange place built upon solid rock\\" and \\"one of the strongest places we have seen.\\" Upon visiting the Pueblo, the expedition \\"repented having gone up to the place.\\" Further from Alvarado's report: It is believed Coronado's expedition were the first Europeans to encounter the Acoma. (Estevan was a native Moroccan.) Alvarado reported that first the Acoma refused entry even after persuasions but after Alvarado showed threats of an attack the Acoma guards welcomed the Spaniards peacefully noting that they and their horses were tired. The encounter shows that the Acoma had clothing made of deerskin, buffalohide, and woven cotton as well as turquoise jewelry, domestic turkeys, bread, pine nuts, and maize. The village seemed to contain about 200 men. Acoma was next visited by the Spanish 40 years later in 1581 by Fray Agust√≠n Rodr√≠guez and Francisco S√°nchez Chamuscado with 12 soldiers, 3 other friars, and 13 others including Indian servants. The Acoma at this time were reported to be somewhat defensive and fearful. This response may have been due to the knowledge of the Spanish enslavement of other Indians to work in silver mines in the area. However, eventually the Rodr√≠guez and Chamuscado party convinced them to trade goods for food. The Spaniard reports say the pueblo had about 500 houses of either three or four stories high. In 1582, Acoma was visited again by Antonio de Espejo for three months. The Acoma were reported to be wearing mantas. Espejo also noted irrigation in Acomita, the farming village in the north valley near San Jose River which was two leagues from the mesa. He saw evidence of intertribal trade with \\"mountain Querechos\\". Acoma oral history does not confirm this trade but only tells of common messengers to and from the mesa and Acomita, McCartys Village, and Seama.Bolton, Herbert E (ed.). 1916.

(He formally held the area by April 1598.) The Acoma warrior Zutacapan heard of this plan and warned the mesa and organized a defense. However, a pueblo elder Chumpo dissuaded war partly to prevent deaths and partly based on Zutancalpo's (Zutacapan's son) mentioning of the widespread belief that the Spaniards were immortal. Thus, when O√±ate visited on October 27, 1598, Acoma met him peacefully with no resistance to O√±ate's demand of surrender and obedience reported. O√±ate demonstrated his military power by firing a gun salute. Zutacapan offered to meet O√±ate formally in the religious kiva, which is traditionally used as the place to make sacred oaths and pledges. However, O√±ate was scared of death and in suspicious ignorance of Acoma customs refused to enter via ladder from the roof into the dark kiva chambers. Purguapo was another Acoma man out of four chosen for Spaniard negotiations. Gaspar P√©rez de Villagr√° visited Acoma soon after O√±ate's departure by himself with a dog and a horse and asked for other supplies. Villagr√° refused to get off his horse and left to follow after O√±ate's party. However, Zutacapan convinced him to return to receive supplies. In questioning by Zutacapan, Villagr√° said that 103 armed men were two days away from Acoma. Zutacapan then told Villagr√° to leave Acoma. On December 1, 1598, Juan de Zald√≠var, O√±ate's nephew, reached Acoma with 20‚Äì30 men and peacefully traded with them and had to wait some days for their order of ground corn. On December 4, Zald√≠var went with 16 armored men to Acoma to find out about the corn. Zutacapan met them and directed them to the homes with the corn. Zald√≠var's people then divided into groups to collect the corn. The traditional oral Acoma narrative tells that a group attacked some Acoma women leading Acoma warriors to retaliate. The Spanish documents do not report an attack on the women and say that the division of the men was a reaction to Zutacapan's plan to kill Zald√≠var's party. The Acoma killed 12 of the Spaniards including Zald√≠var. Five men escaped although one died from jumping over the citadel leaving four to escape with the remaining camp. On December 20, 1598, O√±ate learned of Zald√≠var's death and after encouraging advice from the friars planned an attack in revenge as well to teach a lesson to other pueblos. Acomas requested help from other tribes to defend against the Spanish. Among the leaders were Gicombo, Popempol, Chumpo, Calpo, Buzcoico, Ezmicaio, and Bempol (a recruited Apache war leader). On January 21, 1599, Vicente de Zald√≠var (Juan de Zald√≠var's brother) reached Acoma with 70 soldiers. The Acoma Massacre started the next day and lasted for three days. On January 23, men were able to climb the southern mesa unnoticed by Acoma guards and breach the pueblo. The Spanish dragged a cannon through the streets toppling adobe walls and burned most of the village killing 800 people (decimated 13% of the 6,000 population) and imprisoning approximately 500 others. The pueblo surrendered at noon on January 24. Zald√≠var lost only one of his men. The Spanish amputated the right feet of men over 25 years old and forced them into slavery for 20 years. They also took males aged 12‚Äì25 and females over 12 away from their parents putting most of them in slavery for 20 years. The enslaved Acoma were given to government officials and various missions. Two other Indian men visiting Acoma at the time had their right hands cut off and were sent back to their respective Pueblos as a warning of the consequences for resisting the Spanish.Hall-Quest, Olga. 1969. Conquistadors and pueblos: The story of the American southwest, 1540‚Äì1848 (p. 84). New York. EP Dutton. On the north side of the mesa, a row of houses still retain marks from the fire started by a cannon during this Acoma War. (O√±ate was later exiled from New Mexico for mismanagement, false reporting, and cruelty by Philip III of Spain.) Mission San Esteban Rey was built c.1641, photograph by Ansel Adams, c.1941 A view from 2009 of the same building, where architectural modifications are apparent Survivors of the Acoma Massacre rebuilt their community 1599‚Äì1620. O√±ate forced the Acoma and other local Indians to pay taxes in crops, cotton, and labor. Spanish rule also brought Catholic missionaries into the area. The Spanish renamed the pueblos with the names of saints and started to construct churches at them. They introduced new crops to the Acoma, including peaches, peppers, and wheat. A 1620 royal decree created Spanish civil offices in each pueblo, including Acoma, with an appointed governor to take command. In 1680 the Pueblo Revolt took place, with Acoma participating. The revolt brought refugees from other pueblos. Those who eventually left Acoma moved elsewhere to form Laguna Pueblo. The Acoma suffered high mortality from smallpox epidemics, as they had no immunity to such Eurasian infectious diseases. They also suffered raiding from the Apache, Comanche, and Ute. On occasion, the Acoma would side with the Spanish to fight against these nomadic tribes. Forced to formally adopt Catholicism, the Acoma proceeded to practice their traditional religion in secrecy, and combined elements of both in a syncretic blend. Intermarriage and interaction became common among the Acoma, other pueblos, and Hispanic villages. These communities would intermingle in a kind of creolization to form the culture of New Mexico. ====San Esteban Del Rey Mission==== Between 1629 and 1641 Father Juan Ramirez oversaw construction of the San Estevan Del Rey Mission Church. The Acoma were ordered to build the church, moving of adobe, straw, sandstone, and mud to the mesa for the church walls. Ponderosa pine was brought in by community members from Mount Taylor, over away. The church has an altar flanked by -high wood pillars. These are hand carved in red and white designs representing Christian and Indigenous beliefs. The Acoma know their ancestors' hands built this structure, and they consider it a cultural treasure. In 1970 it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. and In 2007 the mission church was designated as a National Trust Historic Site, the only Native American site in that ranking as identified by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a non-profit organization. ===19th and 20th century=== The pueblo 1933‚Äì1942 (Ansel Adams) During the nineteenth century, the Acoma people, while trying to uphold traditional life, also adopted aspects of the once-rejected Spanish culture and religion. By the 1880s, railroads brought increased numbers of settlers and ended the pueblos' isolation. In the 1920s, the All Indian Pueblo Council gathered for the first time in more than 300 years. Responding to congressional interest in appropriating Pueblo lands, the U.S. Congress passed the Pueblo Lands Act in 1924. Despite successes in retaining their land, the Acoma had difficulty during the 20th century trying to preserve their cultural traditions. Protestant missionaries established schools in the area, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs forced Acoma children into boarding schools. By 1922, most children from the community were in boarding schools, where they were forced to use English and to practice Christianity. Several generations became cut off from their own culture and language, with harsh effects on their families and societies. ===Present day=== A street in the pueblo, 2012 Today, about 300 two- and three-story adobe buildings stand on the mesa, with exterior ladders used to access the upper levels where residents live. Access to the mesa is by a road blasted into the rock face during the 1950s. Approximately 30 or so people live permanently on the mesa, with the population increasing on the weekends as family members come to visit and tourists, some 55,000 annually, visit for the day. Acoma Pueblo has no electricity, running water, or sewage disposal. A reservation surrounds the mesa, totaling . Tribal members live both on the reservation and outside it. Contemporary Acoma culture remains relatively closed, however. According to the 2000 United States census, 4,989 people identify themselves as Acoma. ==Culture== ===Governance and reservation=== Acoma government was maintained by two individuals: a cacique, or head of the Pueblo, and a war captain, who would serve until their deaths. Both individuals maintained strong religious connections to their work, representing the theocracy of Acoma governance. The Spanish eventually imposed a group to oversee the Pueblo, but, their power was not taken seriously by the Acoma. The Spanish group would work with external situations and comprised a governor, two lieutenant governors, and a council. The Acoma also participated in the All Indian Pueblo Council, which started in 1598 and arose again in the twentieth century. Today, the Acoma controls approximately of their traditional land. Mesas, valleys, hills, and arroyos dot the landscape that averages about in altitude with about of rain each year. Since 1977, the Acoma have increased their domain through several land purchases. On the reservation, only tribal members may own land and almost all enrolled members live on the property. The cacique is still active in the community, and is from the Antelope clan. The cacique appoints tribal council members, staff, and the governor. In 2011 Acoma Pueblo and the Pueblo of Santa Clara were victims of heavy flooding. New Mexico supplied more than $1 million to fund emergency preparedness and damage repair for victims and governor Susana Martinez requested additional funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A buttressed three-story building, and a relic of the ancient 11th century brick architecture that still remain in small numbers on the Pueblo A house with a decorated doorway A traditional wooden ladder leads to the second story entrance of a kiva, a religious contemplation chamber A traditional horno, a mud adobe oven ===Warfare and weaponry=== Historically, engagements in warfare were common for Acoma, like other Pueblos. Weapons used included clubs, stones, spears, and darts. The Acoma later would serve as auxiliaries for forces under Spain and Mexico, fighting against raids and protecting merchants on the Santa Fe Trail. After the nineteenth-century, raiding tribes were less of a threat and Acoma military culture began to decline. The war captain position eventually would change to a civil and religious function. ===Architecture=== Acoma Pueblo has three rows of three-story, apartment-style buildings which face south on top of the mesa. The buildings are constructed from adobe brick with beams across the roof that were covered with poles, brush, and then plaster. The roof for one level would serve as the floor for another. Each level is connected to others by ladders, serving as a unique defensive aid; the ladders are the only way to enter the buildings, as the traditional design has no windows or doors. The lower levels of the buildings were used for storage. Baking ovens are outside the buildings, with water being collected from two natural cisterns. Acoma also has seven rectangular kivas and a village plaza which serves as the spiritual center for the village. ===Family life=== About 20 matrilineal clans were recognized by the Acoma. Traditional child rearing involved very little discipline. Couples were generally monogamous and divorce was rare with a quick burial after death, followed by four days and nights of vigil. Women would wear cotton dresses and sandals or high moccasin boots. Traditional clothing for men involved cotton kilts and leather sandals. Rabbit and deer skin was used for clothing and robes, as well. In the seventeenth century horses were introduced to the Pueblo by the Spanish. Education was overseen by kiva headmen who taught about human behavior, spirit and body, astrology, ethics, child psychology, oratory, history, dance, and music. Since the 1970s, Acoma Pueblo has retained control over education services, which have been keys in maintaining traditional and contemporary lifestyles. They share a high school with Laguna Pueblo. Alcoholism, drug use, and other health issues are prominent on the reservation and Indian Health Service hospitals and native healers cooperate to battle health problems. Alcohol is banned on the Pueblo. The community is served by the Acoma-Canoncito-Laguna (ACL) Hospital run by the Indian Health Services and located in Acoma. Today, 19 clans still remain active. ===Religion=== Traditional Acoma religion stresses harmony between life and nature. The sun is a representative of the Creator deity. Mountains surrounding the community, the sun above, and the earth below help to balance and define the Acoma world. Traditional religious ceremonies may revolve around the weather, including seeking to ensure healthy rainfall. The Acoma also use kachinas in rituals. The Pueblos also had one or more kivas, which served as religious chambers. The leader of each Pueblo would serve as the community religious leader, or cacique. The cacique would observe the sun and use it as a guide for scheduling ceremonies, some which were kept secret. Many Acoma are Catholic, but blend aspects of Catholicism and their traditional religion. Many old rituals are still performed. In September, the Acoma honor their patron saint, Saint Stephen. For feast day, the mesa is opened to the public for the celebration. More than 2,000 pilgrims attend the San Esteban Festival. The celebration begins at San Esteban Del Rey Mission and a carved pine effigy of Saint Stephen is removed from the altar and carried into the main plaza with people chanting, shooting rifles, and ringing steeple bells. The procession then proceeds past the cemetery, down narrow streets, and to the plaza. Upon arriving at the plaza, the effigy is placed in a shrine lined with woven blankets and guarded by two Acoma men. A celebration follows with dancing and feasting. During the festival, vendors sell goods such as traditional pottery and cuisine. ===Subsistence=== Before contact with the Spanish, Acoma people primarily ate corn, beans, and squash. Mut-tze-nee was a popular thin corn bread. They also raised turkeys, tobacco, and sunflowers. The Acoma hunted antelope, deer, and rabbits. Wild seeds, berries, nuts, and other foods were gathered. After 1700, new foods were noted in the historical record. Blue corn drink, pudding, corn mush, corn balls, wheat cake, peach-bark drink, paper bread, flour bread, wild berries, and prickly pear fruit all became staples. After contact with the Spanish, goats, horses, sheep and donkeys were raised. In contemporary Acoma, other foods are also popular such as apple pastries, corn tamales, green-chili stew with lamb, fresh corn, and wheat pudding with brown sugar. Irrigation techniques such as dams and terraces were used for agricultural purposes. Farming tools were made of wood and stone. Harvested corn would be ground with hands and mortar. ===Ethnobotany=== A full list of their ethnobotany can be found at http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/2/ (68 documented plant uses). ===Economy=== Polychrome olla from Acoma Pueblo, c. 1889-1903, made for the tourist trade. Historical Acoma economic practices are described as socialistic or communal. Labor was shared and produce was distributed equally. Trading networks were extensive, spreading thousands of miles throughout the region. During fixed times in the summer and fall, trading fairs were held. The largest fair was held in Taos by the Comanche. Nomadic traders would exchange slaves, buckskins, buffalo hide, jerky, and horses. Pueblo people would trade for copper and shell ornaments, macaw feathers, and turquoise. The Acoma would trade via the Santa Fe Trail starting in 1821, and with the arrival of railroads in the 1880s, the Acoma became dependent on American-made goods. This dependency would cause traditional arts such as weaving and pottery making to decline. Today, the Acoma produce a variety of goods for economic benefit. Agriculturally they grow alfalfa, oats, wheat, chilies, corn, melon, squash, vegetables, and fruit. They raise cattle and have natural reserves of gas, geothermal, and coal resources. Uranium mines in the area provided work for the Acoma until their closings in the 1980s. After that, the tribe provided most employment opportunities. However, high unemployment rates trouble the Pueblo. The legacy of the uranium mines has left radiation pollution, causing the tribal fishing lake to be drained and some health problems within the community. ====Tourism==== The Sky City Cultural Center, which includes the Haak'u Museum Tourism is a major source of income for the tribe. In 2008 Pueblo Acoma opened the Sky City Cultural Center and Haak'u Museum at the base of the mesa, replacing the original, which was destroyed by fire in 2000. The center and museum seek to sustain and preserve Acoma culture. Films about Acoma history are shown and a caf√© serves traditional foods. The architecture was inspired by pueblo design and indigenous architectural traditions with wide doorways in the middle, which in traditional homes make the bringing of supplies easier, Flecks of mica are in the windowpanes, a mineral which is used to create mesa windows. The complex is also fire resistant, unlike traditional pueblos, and is painted in light pinks and purples to match the landscape surrounding it. Traditional Acoma artwork is exhibited and demonstrated at the Center, including ceramic chimneys crafted on the rooftop. Arts and crafts also bring income into the community. Acoma Pueblo is open to the public by guided tour from March thru October, though June and July have periods of closure for cultural activities. It is advisable for visitors to call ahead to confirm whether they are open or not. Photography of the Pueblo and surrounding land is restricted. Tours and camera permits are purchased at the Sky City Cultural Center. While photography may be produced with permit, video recordings, drawings, and sketching are prohibited.\\"Acoma and Laguna Pueblos: Planning a Trip\\", Frommers Guide The Acoma Pueblo also has a casino and hotel - the Sky City Casino Hotel. The casino and hotel are alcohol-free and are maintained by the Acoma Business Enterprise which oversees most Acoma businesses. ===Arts=== Acoma seed pot by B. Aragon - traditionally, seeds were stored inside this type of pottery and the pots broken as needed At Acoma, pottery remains one of the most notable artforms. Men created weavings and silver jewelry, as well. ====Pottery==== Pottery inside a house, c. 1900 Acoma pottery dates back to more than 1,000 years ago. Dense local clay, dug up at a nearby site, is essential to Acoma pottery. The clay is dried and strengthened by the addition of pulverized pottery shards. The pieces then are shaped, painted, and fired. Geometric patterns, thunderbirds, and rainbows are traditional designs, which are applied with the spike of a yucca. Upon completion, a potter would lightly strike the side of the pot, and hold it to their ear. If the pot does not ring, then the pot will crack during firing. If this was found, the piece would be destroyed and ground into shards for future use. ==Communities== * Acomita * Anzac * McCartys * Sky Line * Old Sky Line ==Acoma Pueblo people== * Marie Chino, traditional pottery artist * Vera Chino, traditional pottery artist * Lucy Lewis, traditional pottery artist * Simon J.

He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1946. ==Early life and ministry== John Glennon was born in Kinnegad, County Westmeath, Ireland, to Matthew and Catherine (n√©e Rafferty) Glennon. After graduating from St. Finian's College, he entered All Hallows College near Dublin in 1878. He accepted an invitation from Bishop John Joseph Hogan in 1882 to join the newly erected Diocese of Kansas City in the United States. Glennon, after arriving in Missouri in 1883, was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Hogan on December 20, 1884. He was then assigned to St. Patrick's Church in Kansas City and, briefly returning to Europe, furthered his studies at the University of Bonn in Germany. Upon his return to Kansas City, Glennon became rector of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. He was later made vicar general (1892) and apostolic administrator (1894) for the diocese. ==Episcopal career== On March 14, 1896, Glennon was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Kansas City and Titular Bishop of Pinara by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following June 29 from Archbishop John Joseph Kain, with Bishops Maurice Francis Burke and John Joseph Hennessy serving as co- consecrators. At age 34, he became one of the youngest bishops in the world. ===Archbishop of St. Louis=== Glennon was later named Coadjutor Archbishop of St. Louis on April 27, 1903. He succeeded Archbishop Kain as the fourth Archbishop of St. Louis upon the latter's death on October 13 of that year. Realizing the Cathedral of St. Louis could no longer accommodate its growing congregation, Glennon quickly began raising funds for a new cathedral, the cornerstone of which was later laid on October 18, 1908. He opened the new Kenrick Seminary in 1915, followed by the minor seminary in Shrewsbury. He delivered the eulogy at the funeral of Cardinal James Gibbons, and was appointed an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne on June 28, 1921. He opposed British rule in Ireland, and supported the leaders of the Easter Rebellion. The Archbishop once lamented the fact that women were competing with men in the workforce, saying, \\"Some of the women go downtown in the race and race beside the men...It is regrettable that men have to let them, are compelled to let them.\\" Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, Glennon declared, \\"We are not a military nation, but we are at war.... Churches have a duty in time of war not to promote hatred, racial or otherwise. Churches should give their moral aid and their physical support to the nation.\\" He was an outspoken opponent of divorce, saying, \\"The modern attitude makes a joke of the sacrament of matrimony.\\" He also condemned gambling games as \\"unworthy of our Catholic people...causing much scandal,\\" and prohibited dancing and drinking at church-sponsored events. The Archbishop sometimes threw the opening ball for the St. Louis Cardinals, but did not play any sports himself, once saying, \\"I once tried golf, but I so disfigured the scenery that I never played again, in fear of public indignation and reprisal.\\" Cardinal Glennon's final resting place Despite a rather popular tenure, as Archbishop of St. Louis he opposed racial integration in the city's Catholic schools, colleges, and universities. During the early 1940s, many local priests, especially Jesuits, challenged the segregationist policies at the city's Catholic schools. The St. Louis chapter of the Midwest Clergy Conference on Negro Welfare, formed locally in 1938, pushed the all-female Webster College to integrate first. However, in 1943, Glennon blocked the enrollment of a young black woman at the college by speaking privately with the Kentucky-based superior of the Sisters of Loretto, which staffed the college. When approached directly by pro-integration priests, Glennon called the integration plan a \\"Jesuit ploy,\\" and quickly transferred one of the complaining priests away from his mission at an African-American parish. The Pittsburgh Courier, an African-American newspaper with national circulation, discovered Glennon's intervention and ran a front- page feature on the Webster incident. In response, Father Claude Heithaus, professor of Classical Archaeology at the Catholic Saint Louis University, delivered an angry sermon accusing his own institution of immoral behavior in its segregation policies. Saint Louis University began admitting African American students that summer when its president, Father Patrick Holloran, managed to secure approval from the reluctant Archbishop Glennon.Donald J. Kemper, \\"Catholic Integration in St. Louis, 1935‚Äì1947,\\" Missouri Historical Review, Oct. 1978, pp. 1‚Äì13. Nevertheless, St. Louis maintained one of the largest numbers of African-American parishes and schools in the country. ===Cardinal and death=== On Christmas Eve 1945, it was announced that the 83-year-old Glennon would be elevated to the College of Cardinals. He originally thought himself too old to make the journey to Rome, but eventually joined fellow Cardinals-elect Francis Spellman and Thomas Tien Ken-sin on their flight, during which time Glennon contracted a cold from which he did not recover. Pope Pius XII created him Cardinal Priest of S. Clemente in the consistory of February 18, 1946. During the return trip to the United States, Glennon stopped in his native Ireland, where he was received by President Se√°n T. O'Kelly and Taoiseach √âamon de Valera. While in Dublin, he was diagnosed with uremic poisoning and later died, ending a 42-year tenure as Archbishop. The Cardinal's body was returned to St. Louis and then buried at the Cathedral. Glennon is the namesake of the community of Glennonville, Missouri. The only diocesan hospital for children, Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, affiliated with St. Louis University Medical Center, was created in his name. ==Notes== ==References== *Christensen, Lawrence O., et al.

He is known for his memoirs, particularly This Boy's Life (1989) and In Pharaoh's Army (1994). He has written four short story collections and two novels including The Barracks Thief (1984), which won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. Wolff received a National Medal of Arts from President Barack Obama in September 2015. His academic career began at Syracuse University (1982‚Äì1997) and, since 1997, he has taught at Stanford University, where he is the Ward W. and Priscilla B. Woods Professor in the School of Humanities and Sciences. ==Life and career== Tobias Wolff was born in 1945 in Birmingham, Alabama, the second son of Rosemary (Loftus) from Hartford, Connecticut, and Arthur Samuels Wolff, an aeronautical engineer who was a son of a Jewish doctor and his wife. The father had become Episcopalian, and Wolff did not learn about his father's Jewish roots until he was an adult. (Wolff was raised and identifies as Catholic, like his mother). His parents separated when Wolff was five and his elder brother Geoffrey was twelve; he lived with his mother in a variety of places, including Seattle, Washington when he was an adolescent. After she remarried, they lived in Newhalem, a small company town in the North Cascade Mountains, where his stepfather, Robert Thompson, worked at Seattle City Light. His father and brother lived on the East Coast during this period. Geoffrey knew nothing about where his brother was until he entered Princeton. As a kid Wolff had a local paper route and was a Boy Scout. After attending Concrete High School in Concrete, also in the North Cascades, Wolff applied to and was accepted by The Hill School, located 35 miles from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He had applied under the self-embellished name \\"Tobias Jonathan von Ansell-Wolff III\\", adopting part of one of his father's personas, Saunders Ansell-Wolff 3d. When Wolff was found to have had forged his transcripts and recommendation letters, he was later expelled.End notes for This Boy's Life Wolff served in the U.S. Army from 1964 to 1968, when he trained for Special Forces, learned Vietnamese, and served as an adviser in Vietnam. He holds a First Class Honours degree in English from Hertford College, Oxford (1972). After returning to the United States, in 1975, he was awarded a Wallace Stegner Fellowship in Creative Writing at Stanford University, where he earned an M.A.. While continuing to write, Wolff taught at Syracuse University from 1980 to 1997. He published his first short story collection in 1981. At Syracuse he served on the faculty with Raymond Carver and was an instructor in the graduate writing program. Authors who had studied with Wolff as students at Syracuse include Jay McInerney, Tom Perrotta, George Saunders, Alice Sebold, William Tester, Paul Griner, Ken Garcia, Dana C. Kabel, Jan-Marie Spanard, and Paul Watkins. In 1997, Wolff transferred to Stanford, where he is the Ward W. and Priscilla B. Woods Professor in the School of Humanities and Sciences. He has taught classes in English and creative writing, and also served as the director of the Creative Writing Program at Stanford from 2000 to 2002. ==Writing== Wolff is best known for his work in two genres: the short story and the memoir. His first short story collection, In the Garden of the North American Martyrs, was published in 1981. The collection was well received and several of its stories have since been published in a number of anthologies. Its publication coincided with a period in which several American authors who worked almost exclusively in the short story form were receiving wider recognition. As writers such as Wolff, Raymond Carver and Andre Dubus became better known, the United States was said to be having a renaissance of the short story. (Their 20th-century North American version of realism was often labelled as Dirty realism for its gritty veracity.) Wolff repudiated this characterization. In 1994, in the introduction to The Vintage Book of Contemporary American Short Stories, he wrote: Wolff's 1984 novella The Barracks Thief won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction for 1985. Most of the action takes place at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Three recent paratrooper training graduates are temporarily attached to an airborne infantry company as they await orders to report to Vietnam. Because most of the men in the company fought together in Vietnam, the three newcomers are treated as outsiders and ignored. When money and personal property are discovered missing from the barracks, suspicion falls on the three newcomers. The narrative structure of the book contains several shifts of tone and point of view as the story unfolds. In 1985, Wolff's second short story collection, Back in the World, was published. Several of the stories in this collection, such as \\"The Missing Person,\\" are significantly longer than the stories in his first collection. Wolff chronicled his early life in two memoirs. This Boy's Life (1989), winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Award for Biography, is devoted to the author's adolescence in Seattle and Newhalem, a remote company town in the North Cascade mountains of Washington. The memoir describes the nomadic and uncertain life Wolff and his mother led after his parents divorced. His mother's subsequent marriage to a man who was revealed as an abusive husband and stepfather deeply affected their lives. In Pharaoh's Army (1994) records Wolff's U.S. Army tour of duty in Vietnam. He published a third collection of stories, The Night in Question, in 1997. His fourth short-story book, Our Story Begins (2008), includes both new and previously published stories. Whether he is writing fiction or non-fiction, Wolff's prose is characterized by an exploration of personal/biographical and existential terrain. As Wyatt Mason wrote in the London Review of Books, \\"Typically, his protagonists face an acute moral dilemma, unable to reconcile what they know to be true with what they feel to be true. Duplicity is their great failing, and Wolff's main theme.\\" Elsewhere Wolff said of the personal nature of his work: \\"I have to be able, with a straight face, to tell myself that something is nonfiction if I say it's nonfiction. That's why, although there are autobiographical elements in some of my stories, I still call them fiction because that's what they are. Even though they may have been set into motion by some catalyst of memory.\\"Homes, A.M. \\"Tobias Wolff\\", BOMB Magazine, Fall, 1996. Retrieved on [2012-07-24] In 1989, Wolff was chosen as recipient of the Rea Award for the Short Story. Wolff has received the O. Henry Award on three occasions, for the stories \\"In the Garden of North American Martyrs\\" (1981), \\"Next Door\\" (1982), and \\"Sister\\" (1985). In 2008, he was awarded The Story Prize for Our Story Begins. ==Adaptations== Some of Wolff's work has been adapted to film. This Boy's Life was adapted as a feature film directed by Michael Caton-Jones. It starred Leonardo DiCaprio as the teenage Wolff, Robert De Niro as Wolff's abusive step-father Dwight, and Ellen Barkin, as Wolff's mother Rosemary. In 2001, Wolff's acclaimed short story \\"Bullet in the Brain\\" (from The Night in Question) was adapted as a short film by David Von Ancken and CJ Follini; it starred Tom Noonan and Dean Winters. ==Family== Tobias Wolff's older brother is the author Geoffrey Wolff. A decade before Tobias Wolff published This Boy's Life, his brother wrote a memoir of his own about the boys' biological father, entitled The Duke of Deception. Wolff's mother later settled in Washington, D.C. There she became president of the League of Women Voters. Tobias Wolff is married and lives with his wife, Catherine Dolores Spohn, and three children in California. ==Awards and honors== *1985 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction for The Barracks Thief *1989 Whiting Award for Fiction and Nonfiction *2006 PEN/Malamud Award (co-winner) *2008 The Story Prize *2014 Stone Award for Lifetime Literary Achievement, Oregon State University * 2014 elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, *2015 National Medal of Arts, US National Endowment for the Arts ==Bibliography== === Novels === *Ugly Rumours (1975) *The Barracks Thief (1984) (novella) *Old School (2003) === Collections === *In the Garden of the North American Martyrs (1981) *Hunters in the Snow (1981) *Back in the World (1985) *The Collected Short Stories *The Night in Question (1997) *Our Story Begins: New and Selected Stories (2008) === Edited volumes === *Matters of Life and Death: New American Stories (1983) *Best American Short Stories (1994) *The Vintage Book of Contemporary American Short Stories (1994) === Non-fiction === *This Boy's Life (1989), a memoir about his boyhood in the 1950s *In Pharaoh's Army (1994), a memoir about his experiences as a soldier in the Vietnam War. === Short fiction === {class=' sortable' width='90%' - !width=25%Title !Year !First published !Reprinted/collected !Notes - Smokers 1976   First published short story. - Fortune 1988    - Memorial 1993    - Bible 2007    - All ahead of them 2013    - } ==References== ==External links== * *Profile at The Whiting Foundation *√úbermensch, an excerpt from the novel Old School in Narrative Magazine (Fall 2003) * *Stifled Truth, an appreciation of Wolff's publications to date, by Wyatt Mason in the London Review of Books *Tobias Wolff reads his short story, \\"Say Yes\\" recorded at the Progressive Reading Series, San Francisco 2008 *'Old School', an interview with Tobias Wolff in the Oxonian Review * Category:1945 births Category:20th- century American novelists Category:21st-century American novelists Category:Alumni of Hertford College, Oxford Category:American memoirists Category:American army personnel of the Vietnam War Category:American male novelists Category:American people of Jewish descent Category:American Roman Catholics Category:The Hill School alumni Category:Living people Category:Minimalist writers Category:Writers from Birmingham, Alabama Category:Writers from Syracuse, New York Category:Stanford University alumni Category:Stanford University Department of English faculty Category:Syracuse University faculty Category:United States Army officers Category:Writers from California Category:Novelists from New York (state) Category:Writers from the San Francisco Bay Area Category:PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction winners Category:American male short story writers Category:20th-century American short story writers Category:21st-century American short story writers Category:The New Yorker people Category:PEN/Malamud Award winners Category:Novelists from Alabama Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:American male non-fiction writers ","title":"Tobias Wolff"},{"id":"1270577","text":"The Kharraqan towers (as known as the Kharrakhan or Kharaghan towers) are a pair of mausolea built in 1067 and 1093, in the Kharraqan region of northern Iran, near Qazvin. They are notable for being an early example of geometric ornament, an early example of double domes, and one of the earlier tomb towers that appeared in Seljuq Iran during the 11th century. The octagonal brick structures stand tall, and each side is wide. The surface of both mausolea demonstrate extensive use of geometry. The interior walls of the older mausoleum are decorated with paintings of various subjects. The eastern tower dates from 1067‚Äì68, and the western tower dates from 1093. These towers are remnant examples of architecture that existed during the Seljuk period of medieval Persia.David Stronach and T. Cuyler Young, Jr, Three Seljuq Tomb Towers, 1. == Descriptions == === Structure === Both mausolea have double shells for the domes; the inner shells are intact, but the outer shells on both towers are lost. There is no direct access to light through the windows on the outer and inner shells of the dome. However, the opposite positions of the window on the two shells allow indirect light into the first tower through the side window on the inner shell. Both octagonal towers have 8 rounded buttresses - one per corner. Stronach and Young speculate there were vertical ribs for the demolished outer shell of the dome; however, they conclude from the lack of same ribs in the inner side that the ridges, accompanying the ribs, were decorative. === Exterior === Both towers have inscriptions of their architect on the exterior surface. Muhammad b. Makki al-Zanjani is inscribed on the earlier tower; Abu‚Äôl-Ma‚Äôali b. Makki al-Zanjani, on the later tower. Stronach and Young indicate the two names refer to the same person‚Äîa local, unknown architect. Also on the exterior of the buildings is an intricate geometric patterning formed of carved bricks. The brick also features lengthy inscriptions, both historical and Quranic. The historical inscription on the Eastern tower includes not only the architect, but also another name, possibly the mausoleum's intended patron, which can only be partially read due to damage. The Kufic inscription of Quranic text on the exterior walls of both towers, identically distributed across sides and buttresses, features Sura 59, verses 21-23, recognizable despite damage on buttresses. Samuel Stern asserts that these Suras are an unusual choice for mausolea, but points to the preceding verses as being more fitting. Parts of the inscriptions above the Western tower's door can be recognized as Sura 23, Verse 115. === Interior === The eastern tower's interior appears to have been fully decorated with frescoes, but only a few survive. There are paintings of mosque lamps in the niches, of pomegranate trees and peacocks in the piers alternating between them, and of a medallion surrounding peacocks and geometrical ornament near the top of the niches. There is also a band of Kufic calligraphy just below the beginning of the dome. The western tower's interior contains no plaster decoration; instead, there are a mihrab and additional brick ornament. It is believed that the occupant of the eastern tower was Abu Sa'id Bijar and the occupant of the western tower was Abu Mansur Iltayti, according to Dr. Samuel Mikl√≥s Stern's transliteration of the inscriptions on the towers. == Interpretations == The Kharraqan towers exhibit more elaborate external design, individualized for each of the 8 sides, in comparison to other towers with more repetitive patterns. Oleg Grabar reminds that there is no concrete method of elucidating the meaning of the abstract, geometric decoration in Islamic architecture. Instead, the intricacy of the geometric pattern promotes appreciation of the visual design itself. The subjects of wall paintings inside the western tower possess symbolic association with heaven. Abbas Daneshvari connects the light of the lamp with the light of the god, thus with paradise. Daneshvari further associates the interior paintings with paradise by emphasizing the iconographic role of peacocks, in sunburst medallions, as the bird of paradise. Peacocks appear in the Islamic medieval culture of Iran in literature and art objects such as textiles and ceramic wares. ==21st century== A photo of the towers' exteriors taken in 2017, showing catastrophic damage following the 2002 Bou'in-Zahra earthquake Both towers were significantly damaged by the 2002 Bou'in-Zahra earthquake. They were in a good state of preservation before the event, suggesting it was one of the most powerful quakes in the region for approximately 900 years. ==See also== *Iranian architecture *Cultural Heritage, Handcrafts and Tourism Organization *Seljuk Architecture *History of Persian domes ==References== Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1067 Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1093 Category:Mausoleums in Iran Category:Architecture of Iran Category:Buildings and structures in Qazvin Province Category:Seljuk architecture Category:National Works of Iran ","title":"Kharraqan towers"},{"id":"1270580","text":"right Joseph Elmer Ritter (July 20, 1892 ‚Äì June 10, 1967) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of St. Louis from 1946 until his death in 1967, and was created a cardinal in 1961. He previously served as auxiliary bishop (1933‚Äì34) and bishop (later archbishop) (1934‚Äì46) of Indianapolis. Ritter was one of the cardinals elector who participated at the Papal Conclave,1963. ==Early life and education== Born July 20, 1892, in New Albany, Indiana, Elmer Joseph Ritter was the fourth of Nicholas (1859‚Äì1944) and Bertha (n√©e Luette) (1865‚Äì1941) Ritter's six children. His father owned and operated the Ritter Bakery (where the family also lived). Both of Ritter's parents were of German descent. As a 1946 newspaper article said \\"It was one of those shops, now rare, in which the whole family, the mother, father and the whole family had to help, either in the store part, which was in the front, or in the bakery which was in the rear.\\" Ritter said his father had a great reverence of education, saying, \\"Dad gave us all a chance to go to college, but only if we applied ourselves.\\" Ritter received his early education at the parochial school of St. Mary of the Annunciation Church in New Albany where he was called \\"Apple-Pie Ritter\\". ===Religious calling=== During the seventh grade, Ritter decided to enter the priesthood. Ritter said \\"There was no vision, no voice from heaven. I simply wanted to be a priest.\\" In 1907, he enrolled at St. Meinrad's Seminary in southern Indiana, where he completed his studies in 1917. ==Priesthood== Ritter was ordained to the priesthood at the St. Meinrad Seminary's Abbey Church on May 30, 1917 by Bishop Joseph Chartrand. His first assignment was as a curate at St. Patrick's Church in Indianapolis. Shortly afterwards, he was transferred to Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, also in Indianapolis where he served as assistant to the bishop in 1920 and rector of the cathedral in 1925 to 1933. In 1922, he received an honorary doctorate of theology from Pope Pius XI. ==Indianapolis years== On February 3, 1933, Ritter was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Indianapolis and titular bishop of Hippos by Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following March 28 from Bishop Chartrand, with Bishops Alphonse John Smith and Emmanuel Boleslaus Ledvina serving as co-consecrators. As an auxiliary bishop, he also served as vicar general of the diocese from 1933 to 1934. At age 40, he was one of the youngest Catholic bishops in the United States. Following the death of Bishop Chartrand, Ritter was appointed the seventh Bishop of Indianapolis on March 24, 1934. In 1938, he directed an end to racial segregation in all Catholic schools in the diocese. His decision, made 16 years before Brown v. Board of Education, was met with opposition by the Ku Klux Klan, whose members protested outside of SS. Peter and Paul Cathedral, and even by his fellow members of the clergy. Also during his tenure, Ritter reorganized the diocesan Catholic Charities, introduced the Catholic Youth Organization, and completed the construction of SS. Peter and Paul Cathedral. He reduced the diocese's debt by $3 million (). Ritter also reorganized the Catholic Charities in the diocese. The Diocese of Indianapolis was elevated to the status of an archdiocese by Pope Pius XII on October 21, 1944, and Ritter was installed as its first Archbishop on December 19, 1944. ==St. Louis years== Ritter was appointed the fourth Archbishop of St. Louis, Missouri, by Pius XII on July 20, 1946, succeeding the late Cardinal John J. Glennon. St. Louis grew quickly during the post-World War II economic boom. Ritter opened an average of three parishes per year in St. Louis city and county. An able administrator, without the authority to tax or compel, Ritter nevertheless raised more than $125,000,000 () to build sixty new parishes, sixteen high schools, and Cardinal Glennon Memorial Hospital during his tenure in the St. Louis diocese. ===Desegregation efforts=== As one of his first acts as archbishop, Ritter announced that Webster College would accept black students, endorsing the Sisters of Loretto‚Äôs wish to enroll black women in their Webster College (which Ritter's predecessor Archbishop Glennon had ruled impossible). He also allowed the senior class of St. Joseph's High School, then the only black Catholic high school, to graduate for the first time at the Cathedral alongside white Catholic high school students. ===Desegregated diocesan schools and hospitals=== On August 9, 1947, Ritter announced an end to racial segregation in all five St. Louis diocesan high schools before the fall term. He declared, \\"The cross on top of our schools must mean something,\\" and expressed his belief in \\"the equality of every soul before Almighty God\\". Ritter sent a memo to all parish school superintendents, saying they must begin to \\"accept all children into parish schools without regard to race\\". In one stroke, Ritter had desegregated the Catholic St. Louis area schools, seven years before the US Supreme Court‚Äôs \\"Brown\\" decision. The parochial schools represented one-quarter of all St. Louis area students. In response, a group of over 700 white Catholics from 49 St. Louis area parishes calling themselves the \\"Catholic Parents Association of Saint Louis and Saint Louis County\\" threatened to sue Ritter on the basis that his directive was contrary to Missouri state law. Association co-chairman William T. Rone said \\"We do not want Negro children alongside our children in the schools.\\" Ritter refused to meet their leaders, having his spokesman respond, saying, \\"He is the father of the whole flock and must care for all, regardless of race.\\" Ritter then issued a pastoral letter in which he warned of possible excommunication from the church for \\"interfering with ecclesiastical office authority by having recourse to authority outside of the church\\". While civil action was vetoed by the group, they did send a letter of protest to the Vatican, addressing their complaint to the Apostolic Delegate to the United States, Amleto Giovanni Cicognani. Cicognani responded (and sent Ritter a copy of his response in advance), saying \\"I am confident that everyone will readily comply with what has been so clearly proposed by the ecclesiastical authority of the Archdiocese\\". Ritter also desegregated all Catholic hospitals in the St. Louis archdiocese. ===Fundraising=== Ritter also developed what is now known as the Annual Catholic Appeal, which remains a primary source of financial support for many archdiocesan educational and charitable activities. ===Ecumenism=== On August 24, 1964, at Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis, Ritter celebrated the world‚Äôs first authorized Mass in English. Ritter also forbade Catholics to see The French Line under danger of serious sin,TIME Magazine. The Censors January 11, 1954 and declared that Catholics must have written permission from the archdiocese to attend secular or non-Catholic colleges.TIME Magazine. The Letter June 20, 1960 He was one of the first bishops to create a diocesan mission, specifically in La Paz, Bolivia. Until that time, most missions had been conducted by Roman Catholic religious institutes or societies of apostolic life. The people of Saint Louis regularly contributed more money to these foreign missions than any archdiocese of its size. He served as president of the National Catholic Educational Association from 1955 to 1956, and was named an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne on October 5, 1956. ===Cardinal=== Ritter was created Cardinal Priest of SS. Redentore e S. Alfonso in Via Merulana by Pope John XXIII in the consistory of January 16, 1961. Between 1962 and 1965, he participated in all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council in Rome. Ritter was viewed as a liberal.TIME Magazine. Cum Magno Dolore October 23, 1964TIME Magazine.

At his request, it was a \\"Low Funeral Mass\\". Cardinal-designate John Patrick Cody, archbishop of Chicago, formerly an auxiliary bishop under the late cardinal in St. Louis, was the main celebrant. Cardinals Richard Cushing, James Francis McIntyre, Lawrence Shehan, and Francis Spellman attended, together with cardinals-designate John Krol and Patrick O'Boyle. Ten archbishops, forty- eight bishops, and four abbots were also in attendance. Some fifty Protestant, Jewish, and Orthodox leaders were present, representing the Episcopal Church, Missouri-Synod Lutheran, United Church of Christ, Greek Orthodox, Baptist, Disciples of Christ, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Salvation Army. In his sermon, Kansas City Bishop Charles Helmsing, another auxiliary bishop who had served under Ritter, spoke of Ritter's liturgical leadership, particularly \\"his concern for a liturgy of the Word that would truly inform and enlighten the people of God.\\" ===Burial and re-interrment=== Ritter was buried in the priest's lot at Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis. He had said he did not want to be buried in the cathedral. On November 2, 1994, Archbishop Justin Rigali of St. Louis had Ritter's remains removed from Calvary Cemetery and re-interred in the crypt of the new cathedral, now the cathedral basilica of St. Louis. ==Legacy== Mosaic depicting Joseph Cardinal Ritter. *Ritter is commemorated by a mosaic tile depiction in the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis showing him reaching out toward a group of people from other faiths on one side, and also an integrated group of school children on the other. *Ritter was a friend of Lionel HamptonTIME Magazine.

William Henry Drayton William Henry Drayton (September 1742 ‚Äì September 3, 1779) was an American planter and lawyer from Charleston, South Carolina. He served as a delegate for South Carolina to the Continental Congress in 1778 and 1779. William Henry was born at his father's plantation, Drayton Hall, on the bank of the Ashley River near Charleston. His father, John Drayton had just completed construction of this massive main house on the rice plantation. His mother was Charlotta Bull Drayton, the daughter of the colony's Governor William Bull. This would remain William's home throughout his life. In 1750 he sent to England for his education. He first studied at Westminster School where he also met young Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. Then he went on to Balliol College, Oxford before returning home in 1764. He read law and was admitted to the bar in South Carolina. Drayton at first opposed the growing sense of colonial unity and resistance after the Stamp Act Congress but reversed his position as the Revolution grew nearer. He first wrote a series of published letters opposing the American actions. When they were published in England, he was made a member of the Colonial Council in 1772. Governor Bull appointed him to the Colony's Court in 1774. However, later that year he wrote a pamphlet, the American Claim of Rights, which supported the call for a Continental Congress. He got removed from all government positions, which completed his conversion to the Rebel cause. He became a member of South Carolina's Committee of Safety in 1775 as well as the provisional Congress that functioned as the colony's rebel government. In 1776, he and Arthur Middleton designed the Great Seal of South Carolina. When they began operating under an interim constitution in 1776, he returned to his seat on the council, serving as Chief Justice of state's Supreme Court. When the South Carolina General Assembly unanimously voted for union with Georgia in 1776, Drayton became the chief champion of the proposal. The union was rejected by a Georgia convention on January 23, 1777, but Drayton continued to campaign in Georgia for union until Governor John A. Treutlen issued a reward for his arrest. In 1778, Carolina sent Drayton as a delegate to the Continental Congress, where he gave strong support to the military, but he was no friend to the Natives: \\"Cut up every Indian Cornfield and burn every Indian town,\\" he proclaimed, so that their \\"nation be extirpated and the lands become the property of the public.\\" He died while in office at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania of typhus. His home, Drayton Hall, now lies within the expanded city of Charleston. It is operated as a museum and is open to the public for an admission fee. He was married to Dorothy Golightly in 1764; they were the parents of South Carolina Governor John Drayton. He was also the cousin of US Representative William Drayton son of Judge William Drayton Sr.. ==References== ==Further reading== * Keith Krawczynski, William Henry Drayton: South Carolina Revolutionary Patriot; 2001, Louisiana State University Press, . * * ==External links== * Drayton Hall website Category:1742 births Category:1779 deaths Category:Alumni of Balliol College, Oxford Category:Continental Congressmen from South Carolina Category:18th-century American politicians Category:Signers of the Articles of Confederation Category:People educated at Westminster School, London Category:Drayton family Category:American planters Category:American lawyers admitted to the practice of law by reading law ","title":"William Henry Drayton"},{"id":"1270616","text":"Samuel \\"Sam\\" Selvon (20 May 1923 ‚Äì 16 April 1994)\\"Samuel Selvon\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. was a Trinidad-born writer, who moved to London, England, in the 1950s. His 1956 novel The Lonely Londoners is groundbreaking in its use of creolised English, or \\"nation language\\", for narrative as well as dialogue. ==Life and work== Samuel Dickson Selvon was born in San Fernando in the south of Trinidad, the sixth of seven children.Ramchand, Kenneth, \\"Selvon, Samuel Dickson (1923‚Äì1994)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, October 2006.

His maternal grandfather was Scottish and his maternal grandmother was Indian.James, Louis, \\"Obituary: Sam Selvon\\", The Independent, 20 April 1994. He was educated at Naparima College, San Fernando, before leaving at the age of 15 to work. He was a wireless operator with the local branch of the Royal Naval Reserve from 1940 to 1945 during the Second World War. Thereafter, he moved north to Port of Spain, and from 1945 to 1950, worked for the Trinidad Guardian as a reporter and for a time on its literary page. In this period, he began writing stories and descriptive pieces, mostly under a variety of pseudonyms, including Michael Wentworth, Esses, Ack-Ack, and Big Buffer.Author profile at Peepal Tree Press. Much of this early writing is to be found in Foreday Morning (eds Kenneth Ramchand and Susheila Nasta, 1989). Selvon moved to London, England, in 1950, where he took menial jobs eventually working as a clerk for the Indian Embassy, while writing in his spare time. His short stories and poetry appeared in various publications, including the London Magazine, New Statesman, and The Nation. In London he also worked with the BBC, producing two television scripts, Anansi the Spiderman, and Home Sweet India.\\"Samuel Selvon\\", Caribbean Hall of Fame. Selvon was a fellow in creative writing at the University of Dundee from 1975 until 1977. In the late 1970s Selvon moved to Alberta, Canada, and found a job teaching creative writing as a visiting professor at the University of Victoria. When that job ended, he took a job as a janitor at the University of Calgary in Alberta for a few months before becoming writer-in-residence there. He was largely ignored by the Canadian literary establishment, with his works receiving no reviews during his residency. On a return trip to Trinidad Selvon died of respiratory failure due to extensive bronchopneumonia and chronic lung disease on 16 April 1994 at Piarco International Airport; his ashes were subsequently interred at the University of the West Indies cemetery, St Augustine, Trinidad. Selvon married twice: in 1947 to Draupadi Persaud, with whom he had one daughter, and in 1963 to Althea Daroux, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. ==Writing== Selvon is best known for his novels The Lonely Londoners (1956) and Moses Ascending (1975). His novel A Brighter Sun (1952), detailing the construction of the Churchill-Roosevelt Highway in Trinidad through the eyes of young Indian worker Tiger, was a popular choice on the CXC English Literature syllabus for many years. Other notable works include the collection of stories Ways of Sunlight (1957), Turn Again Tiger (1958) and Those Who Eat the Cascadura (1972). During the 1960s and 1970s, Selvon converted several of his novels and stories into radio scripts, broadcast by the BBC, which were collected in Eldorado West One (Peepal Tree Press, 1988) and Highway in the Sun (Peepal Tree Press, 1991). The Lonely Londoners, like most of Selvon's later work, focuses on the migration of West Indians to Britain in the 1950s and 1960s, and tells, mostly in anecdotal form, the daily experience of settlers from Africa and the Caribbean. Selvon also illustrates the panoply of different subcultures that exist within London, as with any major city, due to class and racial boundaries. In many ways, his books are the precursors to works such as White Teeth by Zadie Smith and The Buddha of Suburbia by Hanif Kureishi. Selvon explained: > \\"When I wrote the novel that became The Lonely Londoners, I tried to > recapture a certain quality in West Indian everyday life.

This alkoxy group has the formula O-CH3. On a benzene ring, the Hammett equation classifies a methoxy substituent at the para position as an electron-donating group, but as an electron-withdrawing group if at the meta position. At the ortho position, steric effects are likely to cause a significant alteration in the Hammett equation prediction which otherwise follows the same trend as that of the para position. ==Occurrence== The simplest of methoxy compounds are methanol and dimethyl ether. Other methoxy ethers include anisole and vanillin. Many alkoxides contain methoxy groups, e.g. tetramethyl orthosilicate and titanium methoxide. Such compounds are often classified as methoxides. Esters with a methoxy group can be referred to as methyl esters, and the ‚ÄîCOOCH3 substituent is called a methoxycarbonyl. ===Biosynthesis=== In nature, methoxy groups are found on nucleosides that have been subjected to 2'-O-methylation, for example in variations of the 5'-cap structure known as cap-1 and cap-2. They are also common substituents in O-methylated flavonoids, whose formation is catalyzed by O-methyltransferases that act on phenols, e.g., Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT). Many natural products in plants, e.g. lignins, are generated via catalysis by caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase. ===Methoxylation=== Organic methoxides are often produced by methylation of alkoxides. Some aryl methoxides can be synthesized by metal-catalyzed methylation of phenols, or by methoxylation of aryl halides. ==References== Category:Alkoxy groups ","title":"Methoxy group"},{"id":"1270638","text":"Elijah Jerry \\"Pumpsie\\" Green (October 27, 1933 ‚Äì July 17, 2019) was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) infielder who played with the Boston Red Sox (1959‚Äì62) and New York Mets (1963). A switch-hitter who threw right- handed, he was listed as tall and . Green had the distinction of being the first black player to play for the Red Sox, the last pre-expansion major- league club to integrate. In his Boston tenure, he was used mostly as a pinch runner or day-off replacement for infielders Pete Runnels and Don Buddin. Green made his debut on July 21, 1959, pinch-running in a 2‚Äì1 loss against the Chicago White Sox. ==Early life== Green was born in Boley, Oklahoma, the eldest of five children. One brother, Cornell Green, was a long-time safety for the Dallas Cowboys. Another brother, Credell Green, played football at the University of Washington and was drafted by the Green Bay Packers. Green was named Elijah, after his father, but his mother called him \\"Pumpsie\\" from an early age, though Green related that he did not know the origin of the name. Green grew up in Richmond, California, and was a three-sport athlete at El Cerrito High School. Since major-league baseball had not yet expanded to the West Coast, Green grew up a fan of the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League. Green later stated that he may have been even better at basketball, but chose to play baseball when he was offered a baseball scholarship at Fresno State University. However, Green decided to attend Contra Costa College when Gene Corr, his high school baseball coach, became the baseball coach there and promised Green he would play shortstop if he attended. In Green's final year of college, he tried out for the Oaks, and was signed to a contract. ==Minor league career== In 1954, Green batted .297 in his second season with the Wenatchee Chiefs, an affiliate of the Oaks. In 1955, he was promoted to the Stockton Ports, the Oaks' top affiliate. Green's contract was purchased by the Boston Red Sox during the 1955 season, but he was allowed to finish the season with Stockton before playing the 1956 season with the Albany Senators, a Red Sox affiliate. Green spent the 1957 season with the Oklahoma City Indians and San Francisco Seals, and the 1958 season with the Minneapolis Millers. In 1959, Green was invited to the Red Sox's major league spring training camp. Despite playing well and receiving much media attention, Green was sent back to Minneapolis. However, after hitting .320 through 98 games, he was promoted to the major league Red Sox. ==Major league career== Green made his MLB debut on July 21, 1959, against the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park, entering the game in the top of the eighth as a pinch runner for Vic Wertz and playing shortstop in the bottom of the eighth and becoming the Sox's first black player. He started the next day at second base, batting second and going 0-for-3. His first MLB hit came in his fourth game, on July 28 in Cleveland when he singled off of Jim Perry. That same day, pitcher Earl Wilson made his MLB debut, becoming the Red Sox' second black player. Green's first at bat at Fenway Park was on August 4 against the Kansas City Athletics; he hit a triple off the Green Monster. Green played 50 games for the 1959 Red Sox, batting .233 and playing second base almost exclusively. Green enjoyed a much more full-time role in 1960, playing 133 games, 69 at second base, and 41 at shortstop; he batted for a .242 average. Green may have had his best season in 1961, posting career highs in home runs (6), RBI (27), doubles (12), and stolen bases (4); however, he also had the most errors of his career in 1961, with 16. Despite a hot start to the season, Green developed appendicitis in Washington, D.C. in May, which put him out of the lineup for about four weeks and kept him from playing at full strength for even longer. In 1962, after a weekend of humiliating losses to the New York Yankees, Green along with Gene Conley got off the bus in the middle of a traffic jam in The Bronx. Conley was not spotted until three days later by a New York Post sports reporter at the Idlewild International Airport trying to board a plane for Israel, with no passports or luggage. After the 1962 season, Green was traded to the New York Mets along with Tracy Stallard and Al Moran in exchange for Felix Mantilla. Green played the majority of the 1963 season with the Buffalo Bisons but also played 17 games with the Mets. He played his final major league game with the Mets on September 26, 1963. Green played two more seasons in the minor leagues before retiring after the 1965 season. In a five-season major league career, Green was a .246 hitter with 13 home runs and 74 RBI in 344 games. His 196 career hits also included 31 doubles and 12 triples. ==After baseball== Green in 2012 Following his retirement from playing baseball, Green worked at Berkeley High School in Berkeley, California for over 20 years, serving as a truant officer,Selvin, Joel, \\"Altamont\\", P. 157 coaching baseball and teaching math in summer school. Green lived in El Cerrito, California, since seven years after his retirement from baseball. He was married to Marie for over 50 years. On April 17, 2009, Green was honored by the Red Sox in a first-pitch ceremony, in recognition of 50 years since his breaking of the Red Sox color barrier. In February 2012, Green was honored by the city of El Cerrito, and presented with a proclamation honoring his \\"distinguished stature in baseball history.\\" In April 2012, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Jackie Robinson day at Fenway Park, and also attended Fenway's 100th anniversary celebrations later that month. In May 2018, Green was inducted to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame. On July 17, 2019, Green died at the age of 85.

Rebuilt shortly after the Great Fire of 1666, the pub is known for its literary associations, with its regular patrons having included Charles Dickens, G.K. Chesterton and Mark Twain. The pub is on the Campaign for Real Ale's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors. ==Age== Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese is located in an alley off Fleet Street Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese is one of a number of pubs in London to have been rebuilt shortly after the Great Fire of 1666. There has been a pub at this location since 1538. While there are several older pubs which have survived because they were beyond the reach of the fire, or like The Tipperary on the opposite side of Fleet Street because they were made of stone, this pub continues to attract interest due to the lack of natural lighting inside. Some of the interior wood panelling is nineteenth century, some older, perhaps original. The vaulted cellars are thought to belong to a 13th-century Carmelite monastery which once occupied the site. The entrance to this pub is situated in a narrow alleyway and is very unassuming, yet once inside visitors will realise that the pub occupies a lot of floor space and has numerous bars and gloomy rooms. In winter, open fireplaces are used to keep the interior warm. In the bar room are posted plaques showing famous people who were regulars. The pub is currently owned and operated by the Samuel Smith Brewery. ==Literary associations== Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese in 1873 The literary figures Oliver Goldsmith, Mark Twain, Alfred Tennyson, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, G.K. Chesterton, P. G. Wodehouse and Samuel Johnson are all said to have been 'regulars'. However, there is no recorded evidence that Johnson ever visited the pub, only that he lived close by, at 17 Gough Square. At The Johnson Club supper, 13 December 1892, 'an eloquent gentleman, present, an Irish former MP,John O'Connor Power, orator and founding member and Prior of the Johnson Club (1888). pointed out that when Johnson acted on his suggestion \\"let us take a walk down Fleet Street\\" the Cheshire Cheese must of necessity have been included among his places of call.' Charles Dickens had been known to use the establishment frequently, and it is alluded to in his A Tale of Two Cities: following Charles Darnay‚Äôs acquittal on charges of high treason, Sydney Carton invites him to dine, \\"drawing his arm through his own\\" Carton leads him to Fleet Street \\"up a covered way, into a tavern ‚Ä¶ where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine\\". R.L. Stevenson mentions the Cheese in The Dynamiter (1885), 'a select society at the Cheshire Cheese engaged my evenings.' A Tale of Two Cities was in part the inspiration for the American children's book The Cheshire Cheese Cat by Carmen Agra Deedy, Randall Wright and Barry Moser, which is set in the pub. The Cheshire Cheese pub appears in Anthony Trollope's novel Ralph the Heir, where one of the characters, Ontario Moggs, is described as speaking \\"with vigor at the debating club at the Cheshire Cheese in support of unions and the rights of man...\\" Wodehouse, though so many of his characters were members of posh London clubs, often preferred the homey intimacy of the pub. In a letter to a friend he wrote, \\"Yesterday, I looked in at the Garrick at lunchtime, took one glance of loathing at the mob, and went off to lunch by myself at the Cheshire Cheese.\\" The pub is mentioned by name in some of his books as well. The Rhymers' Club was a group of London-based poets, founded in 1890 by W. B. Yeats and Ernest Rhys. Originally not much more than a dining club, it produced anthologies of poetry in 1892 and 1894. They met at the Cheshire Cheese and in the 'Domino Room' of the Caf√© Royal. R. Austin Freeman in his 1913 novel The Mystery of 31 New Inn describes a luncheon at the pub in some detail, including mention of the beef-steak pudding and 'the friendly portrait of the \\"great lexicographer\\" [Johnson] that beamed down...from the wall'. According to the Betty Crocker cookbook, both Dickens and Ben Jonson dined on Welsh rarebit at this pub, although Jonson died almost a century before the dish is first known to have been recorded.Oxford English Dictionary, volume W, Oxford University Press, 1928, and the Compact (micrographic) edition of 1971 Soviet writer Boris Pilnyak visited the pub during his stay in London in 1923. He later wrote a story entitled \\"Staryi syr,\\" (\\"old cheese\\" in Russian) a part of which takes place in the Cheshire Cheese Pub. There is a chapter devoted to the Cheshire Cheese and the 'Companions of the Cheshire Cheese' (W.B Yeats' poem 'The Grey Rock' 1914) in That Irishman: The Life and Times of John O'Connor Power by Jane Stanford. Agatha Christie wrote that her fictional detective Hercule Poirot dined with a new client at the Cheshire Cheese in her 1924 story The Million Dollar Bond Robbery, adding a description of \\"the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the establishment.\\" The pub in 1980 The founding meeting of the Medical Journalists' Association took place at the 'Cheese' on 1 February 1967. At that time, health journalism was in its infancy, and medical doctors who wrote articles under their own name could be reported to the General Medical Council. From an initial membership of 48, the MJA now represents around 500 journalists, broadcasters and editors. A 1680 broadside ballad called A New Ballad of the Midwives Ghost tells a fantastical story of how a midwife haunted the house where she died until she was able to induce the new residents there to dig up the bones of some bastard children she had made away with and buried there. The final lines of the ballad insist upon the veracity of the tale and even that the children's bones may be seen for proof displayed at the Cheshire Cheese. ==Polly the Parrot== For around 40 years, Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese was associated with a grey parrot named Polly. On its death in 1926 around 200 newspapers across the world wrote obituaries, while the news was read out on radio station 2LO. ==Erotic tiles== In 1962, the pub gave the Museum of London a number of sexually explicit erotic plaster of Paris tiles recovered from an upper room. These tiles strongly suggest that the room was used as a brothel in the mid-eighteenth century. ==References== * Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), The Regional Inventory for London, Pub Interiors of Special Historic Interest. ==Further reading== * * That Irishman: The Life and Times of John O'Connor Power, Part Three, 'At Large', Jane Stanford, The History Press, 2011, ==External links== * *Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese Review by City Pubs *Review by Party Earth Category:1538 establishments in England Category:Grade II listed pubs in the City of London Category:National Inventory Pubs Category:Tourist attractions in the City of London ","title":"Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese"},{"id":"1270649","text":"Michael Lupica (; born May 11, 1952) is an author and former American newspaper columnist, best known for his provocative commentary on sports in the New York Daily News and his appearances on ESPN. == Biography == Lupica was born in Oneida, New York, where he spent his pre-adolescent years, having attended St. Patrick's Elementary School through the sixth grade.

The ring totals 106 miles and has 115 locks, although there are two alternative routes through the southern part of Birmingham - from Kingswood Junction, one route follows the Grand Union Canal to Salford Junction, where it joins the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, and the other follows the Stratford Canal (north) and Worcester and Birmingham Canal to Gas Street Basin in central Birmingham. The latter route is slightly longer and has more locks, but many consider it to be more scenic and interesting. ==Route== There is something of everything, in canal terms, around the Warwickshire Ring. There are wide beam and narrowbeam locks; there is idyllic open rolling countryside, and the grimness of industry, some of it removed, some of it improved, and some of it still there in all its awfulness. There are tourist honeypot sites, like Warwick Castle, and there are world class attractions like Drayton Manor Theme Park. The ring is made up of parts of four canals. *Grand Union Canal *Birmingham and Fazeley Canal *Coventry Canal *Oxford Canal ===Grand Union Canal=== Starting at Braunston Turn, the route heads west along the Grand Union Main Line for five miles to Napton Junction, through pleasant farm land. The only village close to the canal is Lower Shuckburgh. This section was originally owned by the Oxford Canal. At Napton Junction, the Oxford Canal continues straight ahead, but the ring turns to the north, passing Napton Reservoirs on the left before descending through the first three locks at Calcutt. Prior to 1929, this section was owned by the Warwick and Napton Canal company, which amalgamated with several other companies to form the Grand Union Canal. One immediate benefit was a plan costing ¬£881,000 to widen the locks. The original narrow locks, replaced by three wide beam ones in the 1930s, are still there alongside. Turning westward, the canal heads towards Stockton locks. These eight locks carry the canal downhill to Long Itchington, and again the old narrow locks are still visible. After two more isolated locks, there are the Bascote four, with the top two forming a staircase. Six more locks take the canal on to the floor of the Leam (pronounced \\"Lem\\") and Avon valleys. At Royal Leamington Spa, the ornamental Jephson Gardens commemorate Dr. Jephson, who lived from 1798 to 1878, who worked hard to establish the medical reputation of the spa, while tourist attractions at Warwick include the fourteenth century Warwick Castle, which is set in grounds laid out by the landscape architect Capability Brown. The climb out of the Avon Valley begins at the two Cape Locks, where the Cape of Good Hope pub serves a locally brewed ale called Two Locks, on account of the brewery being two locks down from the pub. The route then turns right onto the line of the Warwick and Birmingham Canal, another of the constituent canals that made up the Grand Union Canal. To the left Saltisford Basin is run by a Canal Trust; it once led to the terminus of the Warwick and Birmingham Canal, prior to the construction of the Warwick and Napton Canal. After climbing a few of the 21 Hatton Locks, the view opens up to show the enormous locks climbing the hill in an unbroken line westwards. Although heavy to operate, the locks fill and empty quickly. From Hatton top, there is a ten-mile respite from locks, punctuated by the Shrewley Tunnel, which passes under Shrewley village. The tunnel, which has a towpath and is wide enough to allow two boats to pass each other, emerges near to the village centre. At Kingswood Junction, there is a choice of route. For those intending to go to Gas Street and Birmingham city centre, the narrowbeam Stratford-on-Avon Canal offers more locks and a longer passage, but for boaters going straight round the ring, the main line route is shorter and quicker. The five locks at Knowle raise the canal to its summit. They replaced six narrow locks in 1930, the remains of which can still be seen to one side of the channel, and are the last wide locks before Birmingham. After passing under the M42 motorway, an aqueduct carries the canal over the River Blythe, before it turns to the west near Solihull. The journey through Solihull is in a deep leafy cutting, shielding the boater from urban views. Trees then give way to disused wharves and housing estates. The six Camp Hill locks are narrow beam and drop the canal down to Bordesley Junction, where the Warwickshire Ring turns to the right. Ahead is the route to Digbeth Basin: in the 1930s it was the Birmingham Hub of a national canal transport system. There are bonded warehouses, an ice house, a major Fellows Moreton & Clayton warehouse, a banana warehouse and in Typhoo Basin, a tea warehouse. From Bordesley Junction, Saltley Cut was reviled as the filthiest place on the whole canal system, with gas works, a power station, railway works and a chemical works all generating or receiving cargoes, and discharging waste into the canal. It has been cleaned up now, and there is new housing facing the waterfront. The five Garrison Locks lower the canal into the valley of the River Rea, which it crosses on an aqueduct. The Rea is a tributary of the River Tame, which it also crosses just before Salford Junction, where the Grand Union Canal meets the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal and the Tame Valley Canal. Nechells Shallow Lock once controlled the exit from the Grand Union Canal, but is no longer fitted with gates. The junction and the aqueduct are overshadowed by the road decks of spaghetti junction, which tower above them.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map ===Birmingham and Fazeley Canal=== At Salford Junction, boaters following the Warwickshire Ring turn to the right onto the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, which is sandwiched between the backs of factories and the M6 motorway. The route passes a major electricity high voltage distribution centre on the south bank, before reaching Erdington Hall, where a factory has been built over the canal, almost forming a tunnel, although one side remains open to the light. Close by was Fort Dunlop, where the Dunlop Rubber company made pneumatic tyres, employing 10,000 workers at the peak of production in the 1950s. The folly-like footbridge and adjacent swing bridge at Drayton Bassett, one mile from Fazeley Junction. Eventually the canal re-emerges into the comparative calm of Minworth, where three locks lower the level of the canal. To the south is Minworth Sewage Treatment Works, one of the largest in Britain, capable of treating 220 million gallons (1000 Megalitres) per day. The canal continues through a cutting lined with trees, through the short Curdworth tunnel, which is long, to pass under the M6 Toll motorway. The first of the eleven Curdworth locks is immediately after the bridge, and the canal continues through open countryside and flooded gravel pits, although the M42 motorway is never far away to the east. Some of the gravel pits have been landscaped to form Kingsbury Water Park, which covers and contains 30 lakes and pools, providing activities including walking, nature trails, sailing, windsurfing, power boating and horse riding. There is also a children's farm at Broomey Croft. At Fazeley, the canal runs alongside Drayton Manor Theme Park, and crosses Bourne Brook, another tributary of the River Tame, to arrive at Fazeley Junction and the Coventry Canal. ===Coventry Canal=== The section of the Coventry Canal which turns to the left was actually built by the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, because the Coventry Canal ran out of money. However, the Warwickshire Ring turns to the right, along the section built before the shortage of capital occurred. Near the junction is Fazeley Mill, which began making tape in 1886, and has continued to use the same processes ever since. There is also a mill which was built to Richard Arkwright's pattern in 1791, and is one of the best surviving mills of its type. A large aqueduct carries the canal over the River Tame, after which it is bordered by the houses and factories of Tamworth. Between the 1930s and 2001, the Reliant Car Company was based in Tamworth, and manufactured Reliant Robin cars beside the canal. Tamworth also has a castle, which exhibits a wide mix of architectural styles. The motte is Norman, the timbered hall is Elizabethan and the apartments are Jacobean. Two locks raise the level of the canal in Tamworth, after which there is a long level section. Once beyond the housing estates of Tamworth, the canal passes the remains of Alvecote Priory and turns to the south-east. After being crossed by the M42 motorway, it joins the valley of the River Anker, which it follows on a ledge on the west side of the valley. It passes through the centre of Polesworth, and is then surrounded by farmland, before it begins to ascend out of the valley to Atherstone, through a flight of eleven narrow locks. Atherstone was a hatting town, where hats were made from Tudor times, including many for the armies of the world. Towards the end of the twentieth century, hats went out of fashion, and the economy of the town declined. Mercury was used to make certain types of felt, and its toxicity, which affects the brain, led to the expression \\"Mad as a Hatter\\". Between Atherstone and Nuneaton, the canal water is rust coloured, caused by leaching of minerals from the soil, and there are the remains of large granite quarries, many now landscaped and acting as nature reserves. A prominent feature is Mount Judd, a mountain created from waste material from Judkins Quarry. To the south of Nuneaton is Marston Junction, where the Ashby Canal joins, and beyond that, the canal skirts the eastern edge of Bedworth in a long cutting. Shortly afterwards, the canal reaches Hawkesbury Junction, where the Coventry Canal continues for another into the centre of Coventry, and the Oxford Canal turns off to the south-east. Originally, the junction was a little further to the south at Longford. At Hawkesbury Junction there is an old engine house, a graceful curved bridge and the Greyhound pub. Although not part of the Warwickshire Ring, the route into Coventry is a flagship of urban regeneration. The towpath has been cleaned up, resurfaced, lit, policed, and adorned with sculptures and other works of art, and is now a thoroughly pleasant place to walk or cruise. The journey is like a catalogue for a historic vehicle rally, for manufactured here were Daimlers, Rileys, Hillmans and Humbers. Access to Coventry Basin is through a tiny bridge hole, which was designed so that it could be sealed off each evening by a large wooden beam. The basin has been beautifully and sympathetically restored, with new retail units blending seamlessly with buildings from another era. The focal point is a more than life sized statue of James Brindley standing in the centre. ===Oxford Canal=== Hawkesbury Junction, where the Oxford Canal (on the right) joins the Coventry Canal From Hawkesbury Junction, the Oxford Canal twists and turns while generally heading south east, as its engineer James Brindley built a contour canal which closely followed the contours of the land. In the 1820s, it was straightened and shortened by creating cuttings and embankments to make it a better competitor to the railways, and the distance to Braunston was almost reduced from to . Where the original meanderings remain, the towpath is carried over the junction on elegantly engineered cast iron bridges, carrying the inscription \\"Horseley Ironworks 1828\\". Much of the route is rural, although the M69 motorway and the M6 motorway both cross the canal. Brinklow was once served by an arm of the canal, which is now disused, and an aqueduct on the main line near its start has been turned into an embankment by filling in the arches. At Newbold-on-Avon there is a tunnel, beyond which the scenery is much more urban, although the canal passes to the north-east of Rugby on an embankment, and is separated from it by a railway line. There is quite a community of boaters and businesses at Hillmorton Locks, which were duplicated in the 1830s to alleviate congestion. The high Hillmorton Wireless Aerials, built in 1924, are a significant landmark for miles around. Beyond Hillmorton, the canal turns under the railway, and then passes under the M45 motorway, to head for Braunston. The very distinctive spire of Braunston Church is another landmark on the final part of the journey back to the start of the Warwickshire Ring. ==Bibliography== * * * ===References=== Category:Canals in England Category:Canals in Warwickshire Category:Canal rings in the United Kingdom ","title":"Warwickshire ring"},{"id":"1270653","text":"The Madurese (sometimes Madurace or Madhure; also known as Orang Madura and Suku Madura in Indonesian) are an ethnic group originally from the island of Madura now found in many parts of Indonesia, where they are the third-largest ethnic group by population. Common to most Madurese throughout the archipelago is the Islamic religion and the use of the Madurese language. The Madurese are a religious ethnicity, often affiliated with Nahdlatul Ulama, a moderate Indonesian Muslim organization. Pesantren has a pivotal role in Madurese life. While the Madurese have their roots on Madura off the northeastern coast of Java, the majority of Madurese do not now live on that island. The Madurese people have migrated out of Madura over several hundred years, mostly driven by poor agricultural resources in their home island. The majority have settled on Java, where an estimated six million Madurese live, especially in East Java where they form about half the population. == Population and distribution == Official and academic data on the population of Madurese people vary considerably. During the nationwide population census conducted in Indonesia in 2010, the Madurese people make up 3.03% of the country's population, that is 7,179,356 people. On the other hand, some scientific sources operate with significantly larger figures around 10.5 to 10.8 million people. In any case, the Madurese people are among the largest ethnics of Indonesia, thus, according to the statistics of the 2010 census, they occupy the fourth largest ethnic group after the Javanese people, Sundanese people and Batak people. Historically, the Madurese people inhabit Madura Island and located to the east of it, a group of smaller islands in Java Sea such as Kambing Island, Sapudi Islands and Kangean Islands. Here they number about 3.3 million people, which is more than 90% of the population in these territories. Approximately the same number of Madurese people living in the eastern end of the Java Island, and more than 400,000 people in various parts of the Indonesian part of the island of Kalimantan. In addition, tens of thousands of the Madurese people live in other regions of Indonesia; especially, there are significant Madurese communities in the capital city of Jakarta (about 80,000 people), in Bali (about 30,000 people) and in the province of Bangka Belitung Islands (more than 15,000 people). There are also small Madurese communities in the countries of Southeast Asia adjacent to Indonesia, particularly, in Singapore. == Language == The area of the Madurese language on Madura Island and north eastern of Java Island is marked with green. The Madurese people speak the Madurese language, which belongs to the Austronesian family, more specifically the Malayo-Sumbawan group. It is divided into several dialects. Linguistically, there are different points of view regarding the dialects of the Madurese language. Older works would normally identify two or four dialects, but modern specialists have concluded that there are six dialects. The most developed dialect in the lexical terms is the Sumenep dialect, which underlies the literary Madurese language. The most common dialect is Bangkalan, which often functions as a lingua franca between Madurese people from different localities. In some parts of East Java among a significant number of Madurese population, a peculiar mixed of Madurese-Javanese dialect has formed. In addition to these native languages, many are also fluent in Indonesian, the national language. == Religion == The majority of Madurese practice Sunni Islam. Characteristically, unlike a significant part of their fellow religious Indonesian, Madurese people enjoy the reputation of very zealous adherents of Islam. Muslim theologians play an important role in their spiritual and social life. A significant part of the Madurese people is trained in traditional Pesantren Muslim schools, which play an important role in their spiritual and social life. There are also Madurese who practice other religions, such as Christianity (both Protestantism and Catholicism) making up not more than 0.2%, and the rest of the other proportion of those professing other religions is extremely small such as Hinduism. Protestant Madurese can be found in northeastern part of Jember Regency, where they have a church that delivers sermon in Madurese, located in Sumberpakem village, Sumberjambe district. The church is a member of East Java Christian Church. == Socio- economic structure == === Basic livelihood === A Madurese batik maker in Tanjungbumi, Bangkalan, Madura, Indonesia. Family is important to the Madurese and they commonly live in villages that function around an Islamic religious center. According to Islamic law, a man may have more than one wife. Marriage proposals are usually made by the groom's parents, preferably to a first or second cousin. If the proposal is accepted, the bride's parents are then presented with the \\"bride price\\", which is usually cattle. The groom's parents then set the date for the upcoming wedding. Newlywed couples often live with the bride's family. Islam is an integral part of the social, political and economic life of the Madurese. The main traditional occupations of the Madurese are animal farming, which mainly includes breeding of cattle, goats, horses, poultry and fighting cocks. The Madurese are known for herding cattle, hence they are often referred by a common nickname as the \\"cowboys\\" of Indonesia. Cattle are an important part of the culture, and bull-racing is one of their favorite sports. Agriculture among the Madurese people on the island of Madura is poorly developed due to low fertility and very poor soil conditions, thus farming is not important in Madurese culture. As a result, the Madurese tend not to farm, unless on other islands with very good soil conditions, such as the Madurese people in Java, where agriculture is practiced more widely and have developed to a lesser degree. The main crops are such as corn, cassava, rice, tobacco, beans and cloves. Among craftsmen, tanning, pottery, batik manufacturing, blacksmithing, as well as small vassals and boat builders are also important occupations. In coastal areas, the Madurese are actively engaged in fishing, trading and as well as extraction of salt (from Madura Island). Lastly, the Madurese people also enjoyed a reputation in the region as skilled seafarers. Madurese residents of large cities, particularly in eastern Surabaya are actively involved in modern economic sectors. === Settlements === Traditional Madurese settlements are scattered and rarely linear in layout, depending rather on the direction of the roads. In most villages, there are paddocks for cattle raring. Houses are made of bamboo and often built on low stilts. They have a frame structure usually supplemented with a veranda. Roofs are covered with palm leaves or reeds, however from the last third of the 20th century, the usage of roof tiles are becoming increasingly common. === Transmigration === Low yields on soils had long served the cause of mass migrant labor and the relocation of the local population outside the island, where the Madurese were major clients of the government's large-scale transmigration programmes undertaken by both the Dutch colonial administration as well as the authorities of independent Indonesia in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, through which they settled in relatively sparsely populated areas of Indonesia's other islands, especially Kalimantan. As a result of this program, more than half of the ethnic Madurese people currently living outside of their customary homeland had settled in many regions of Indonesia, where communities of former transmigrants and their descendants that still maintain their Madurese identity. Madurese people have lived on the territory of Java for several centuries, forming the ethnic majority in some of the north-eastern regions of the island. They tend to get along well with the Javanese people in relation to language, culture, and way of life. Mixed marriages between Javanese and Madurese people are also common. Moreover, in some areas of eastern Java, there are significant communities of descendants of such pendalungan marriages, which are distinguished by their unique cultural traditions that combine Madurese and Javanese elements to varying degrees. Another situation often develops in the provinces of West Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan, where Madurese people resettled under the transmigration programmes in 1900 to 1950 in the span of 90 years. Some of these migrant groups have been the subject of conflict with Dayak communities. The native population, especially the Dayaks were quite wary of strangers, and seeing them as a threat to their traditional livelihoods. Mutual distrust also promote ethnic and cultural and religious differences, where most Dayak people practices Christianity or Kaharingan. The most publicized conflict has been on various localities in Kalimantan, where thousands were killed in a series of large scale armed fighting between the Madurese and the Dayak people during the late 1990s. In West Kalimantan there was communal violence between Dayaks and Madurese in 1996, in the Sambas conflict in 1999 and the Sampit conflict 2001, resulting in large scale massacres of Madurese.Armed Conflicts Report.Indonesia - Kalimantan In the Sambas conflict, both Malays and Dayaks people massacred the Madurese people. Tens of thousands of Madurese people from Kalimantan were forced to move to Madura and Java. By the mid 2000s, the situation has somewhat stabilized and enabled the return of most of the Madurese resettlement back in Kalimantan. == Culture == ===Cuisine=== The Madurese satay is distinguished by the sharp sweetness of the marinade. For the Madurese people, their traditional cuisine is characterized by a fairly large use of meat; of which primarily prepare miniature skewers called satay accompanied with special sweet marinade and thick sharp sauce, has enjoyed a wide popularity in many parts of Indonesia. In addition, traditional Madurese culinary are characterized by the active use of corn and, in general, greater salinity of dishes compared to other regional cuisines of the country. === Folk art and traditional attire === Traditional Madurese dancers, circa 1890-1917. Culturally the Madurese people are close enough to eastern Javanese that they share similar forms of folklore, music (including gamelan), dance, and shadow theater or wayang. The traditional attire, however, is very specific to the Madurese people. Men would wear a completely black long- skirted coat with a wide belt, which most often hooks under a shirt that comes in broad red and white stripes, along with a checkered sarong. While women would have donned a dark blue or mottled jacket over a sarong. === Bull racing === Bull racing (karapan sapi) in Sumenep, Madura, East Java, Indonesia, 1999. A truly unique tradition of the islanders is bull racing, known as Karapan sapi, where local bred bulls harnessed in special light carts are led by a charioteer, usually a young man or teenager. Such competitions are typical of Madura, where they serve as its main tourist attraction. Races are held annually in August and October in different localities, after which their winners compete in the final round, which is traditionally held in Pamekasan. Races are usually accompanied by gamelan performances and folk festivities. By the end of the 1980s, the popularity of Madurese bull racing had grown so much that the winner of the competition would be awarded with a prize on behalf of the President of Indonesia. In addition, the scene of the races was depicted on the reverse of coins of 100 Indonesian rupiah, produced from 1991 to 1998. === Brawling === Traditionally in terms of socio-economic life of the Madurese people, there had been a visible impact on their national character. They are often characterized as hard workers, stubborn, courageous, possessing integrity, loyal, generous, fair; and, at the same time, sharpness, resentment, extreme frugality, isolation, arrogant, hot-tempered, prone to violence and distrust towards strangers - especially against the backdrop of kindness and sociability of their neighbors such as the Javanese people. In rural areas, the Madurese still practice an ancient tradition of vendetta, called \\"charok\\" (carok) which literally means \\"battle of honor\\". In the 1990s, law enforcement agencies in each of the four districts in Madura have recorded dozens of cases each year. The killing may provoke resentment, quite small by the standards of ordinary European or Indonesian. According to local criminal statistics, most of the reason for such attacks are usually molestation of women or property dispute, but it often happens that the Madurese's cruel revenge is motivated by an insufficiently polite treatment or insult in public places to one's honor. Instrument of revenge used in this dueling is often the traditional Madurese crescent knife, celurit which is the most common peasant weapon and in some areas and also the attribute of traditional male attire. In such cases, the avenger usually prepares the celurit in advance in an event of dueling by casting special spells on the weapon. Sometimes in the \\"battle of honor\\" are involved several people from each side - relatives and friends of the offender and the offended, and then it turns into a bloodbath. Such massive bloodshed have repeatedly occurred in Madura even in the 21st century. The most famous incident in recent years, a mass carok occurred on 13 July 2006 in Bujur Tengah village, Pamekasan Regency, East Java, Indonesia, resulting stabbing and killing of seven men and seriously injuring nine people. == References == ==Further reading== * Category:Muslim communities of Indonesia Category:Ethnic groups in Indonesia Category:East Java Category:Madura Island ","title":"Madurese people"},{"id":"1270656","text":"The Monte Ceneri transmitter was first established as the nationwide medium- wave radio transmission station for Italian-speaking Switzerland in 1933.

John O'Hart (1824-1902) was an Irish genealogist. He was born in Crossmolina, County Mayo, Ireland. A committed Roman Catholic and Irish nationalist, O'Hart had originally planned to become a priest but instead spent two years as a police officer. He was an Associate in Arts at the Queen's University, Belfast. He worked at the Commissioners of National Education during the years of the Great Famine. He worked as a genealogist and took an interest in Irish history. He died in 1902 in Clontarf near Dublin, at the age of 78. O'Hart's 800-page, The Irish and Anglo-Irish landed gentry (Dublin 1884), was reprinted in 1969, with an introduction by Edward MacLysaght, the first Chief Herald of Ireland. Another work, Irish pedigrees; or, The origin and stem of the Irish nation, first published in 1876, has come out in several subsequent editions. To complete his genealogies he used the writings of C√∫ Choigcr√≠che √ì Cl√©irigh, Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh and O'Farrell, along with the Annals of the Four Masters, for the medieval pedigrees. He used the works of Bernard Burke, John Collins and others to extend his genealogies past the 17th century. ==Stem of the Irish nation== In his Irish Pedigrees, O'Hart presents the legendary origins of the Irish people, from the Biblical Adam and Eve through the kings of ancient Ireland. Irish tradition holds that every Irish person is descended from the king Milesius who emigrated from Spain in approximately 1700 BC, according to the Annals of the Four Masters. O'Hart started each of his genealogies with Adam, recording Milesius as his 36th descendant. From the start; (1) Adam, his son (2) Seth, his son (3) Enos, his son (4) Cainan, his son (5) Mahalaleel, his son (6) Jared, his son (7) Enoch, his son (8) Methuselah, his son (9) Lamech, his son (10) Noah, his son (11) Japhet, his son (12) Magog, his son (13) Baoth, \\"to whom Scythia came has his lot\\", his son (14) Phoeniusa Farsaidh (Fenius Farsa) King of Scythia, his son (15) Niul, his son (16) Gaodhal (Gathelus), his son (17) Asruth, his son (18) Sruth (who fled Egypt to Creta), his son (19) Heber Scut (returned to Scythia), his son (20) Beouman, King of Scythia, his son (21) Ogaman King of Scythia, his son (22) Tait King of Scythia, his son (23) Agnon (who fled Scythia by sea with the majority of his people), his son (24) Lamhfionn (who led his people to Gothia or Getulia, where Carthage was afterwards built), his son (25) Heber Glunfionn, King of Gothia, his son (26) Agnan Fionn King of Gothia, his son (27) Febric Glas King of Gothia, his son (28) Nenuall King of Gothia, his son (29) Nuadhad King of Gothia, his son (30) Alladh King of Gothia, his son (31) Arcadh King of Gothia, his son (32) Deag King of Gothia, his son (33) Brath, King of Gothia (who left Gothia with a large band of his people and settled in Galicia, Spain), his son (34) Breoghan, King of Galicia, Andalusia, Murcia, Castile, and Portugal, his son (35) Bile, King of Galicia, Andalusia, Murcia, Castile, and Portugal, and his son (36) Galamh (also known as Milesius of Spain), King of Galicia, Andalusia, Murcia, Castile, and Portugal. According to O'Hart's account, Milesius had four sons, Heber, Ir, Heremon, and Amergin, who were involved, with their uncle Ithe, in the invasion of ancient Ireland; Milesius, himself, had died during the planning. Amergin died during the invasion, without issue. It is from the four other invaders ‚Äî Heber, Ir, Heremon, and Ithe ‚Äî from whom the Irish are alleged to descend.

Clay Wilson, is an American underground cartoonist and central figure in the underground comix movement. Wilson attracted attention from readers with aggressively violent and sexually explicit panoramas of lowlife denizens, often depicting the wild escapades of pirates and bikers. He was an early contributor to Zap Comix, and Wilson's artistic audacity has been cited by Robert Crumb as a liberating source of inspiration for Crumb's own work. Recalling when he first saw Wilson's work (in about 1968) Crumb said, \\"The content was something like I'd never seen before, anywhere, the level of mayhem, violence, dismemberment, naked women, loose body parts, huge, obscene sex organs, a nightmare vision of hell-on-earth never so graphically illustrated before in the history of art.... Suddenly my own work seemed insipid...\\"The Art of S. Clay Wilson (Ten Speed Press, 2006), p. vii. A striking feature of Wilson's work is the contrast between the literate way in which his characters speak and think and the depraved violence in which they engage. As James Danky and Denis Kitchen wrote in their book, Underground Classics, \\"He astonished and sometimes frightened his fellow cartoonists, though they saw it as pushing if not eviscerating the boundaries of taste. More than anyone, Wilson defined the boundaries of the medium.\\"James Danky and Denis Kitchen, Underground Classics: the Transformation of Comics to Comix (Abrams, 2009), p. 137. The artist and characters sometimes take violence with a playful attitude, for example getting tired of fighting and agreeing to have sex instead of continuing a battle. Wilson's later work became more ghoulish, featuring zombie pirates and visualizations of the Virgin of Guadalupe as a rotting vampire mother. In many respects, however, his work has remained consistent since his emergence in the 1960s. In contrast to the many countercultural figures who have moderated their more extreme tendencies and successfully assimilated into the mainstream of commercial culture, Wilson's work has remained troubling to mainstream sensibilities and defiantly ill-mannered. \\"He showed us we had been censoring ourselves,\\" said Zap cohort Victor Moscoso. \\"He blew the doors off the church. Wilson is one of the major artists of our generation.\\"Jennings, Dana. \\"Raunchy and Revered: Zap Comix, Now in a Coffee Table Boxed Set,\\" New York Times (OCT. 31, 2014), pg. 18. Referring to his and the Zap crew's status in art circles, Wilson himself said, \\"If you're not good enough to be a cartoonist, maybe you can be an artist.\\" == Biography == === Early life and education === Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, Wilson drew from age 12 and attended the University of Nebraska. Trained as a medic in the United States Army, he lived in Lawrence, Kansas and held odd jobs before moving to San Francisco in 1968. === Early career === According to Charles Plymell (an editor of Grist magazine, a poetry journal published by John Fowler), Wilson's first published work was in 1966 in Grist #7 and then in Grist #9, also from that same year. The first appearance of the Checkered Demon is said to have been in an ad in a later issue of Grist. His portfolio was printed the following year in 1967 (with subsequent printings later on in comic book form). ===Underground comix=== Cover of Zap Comix #9. Only the covers of Zap were in color. In California, Wilson met up with Charles Plymell, who was publishing Robert Crumb's Zap Comix. Wilson needed little persuasion to contribute to Zap. Wilson began collaborating With Crumb in late 1967, and all issues of Zap comix starting with #2 contain his work. It was in Zap #2 that Wilson widely debuted his most famous character, The Checkered Demon, a portly, shirtless being generally seen wearing checkered pants. Wilson was also a frequent early contributor to another underground project, the Yellow Dog tabloid anthology. Wilson's work was featured in all three issues of The Rip Off Review of Western Culture, published in 1972. The third issue (Nov./Dec. 1972) featured an extensive interview with Wilson by Robert Follett, the publication's editorial director. Wilson was also a frequent contributor to Arcade, edited by Art Spiegelman and Bill Griffith; as well as Weirdo, Crumb's post-underground anthology published in the 1980s and early 1990s. Wilson's underground comix work was praised by such counterculture icons as William S. Burroughs and Terry Southern. ===Painting=== The Art of S. Clay Wilson, published in 2006 by Ten Speed Press, covers his prints and paintings as well as his comics work. ===Book Illustrations=== right His illustrations for Burroughs' Cities of The Red Night and The Wild Boys were published in German editions by 2001 Publishing. In 1994, he began interpreting classic children's stories, illustrating Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm, as he explained to interviewers Jon Randall and Wesley Joost: :I did a children's book entitled Wilson's Andersen. I always wanted to be a children's book illustrator way back when, but I took some LSD and took a left turn graphically. We got William Burroughs to write us a little blurb on the back, but they misspelled Burroughs! How could they do that! The stories are pretty lugubrious--\\"The Rose Elf\\", for instance-- where the woman is kissing the \\"cold blue dead lips\\" of her lovers' head. Later versions leave all this stuff out. Disney takes a great old story and they \\"bleach\\" it--as they used to say about music. To make it palatable and generic.

It is run on 765 kHz with a power of 600 kilowatts and is easily receivable during the night throughout the whole of Europe. Since 1989 the aerial used has been a centre-fed dipole fixed on the outside of a 188-metre- high grounded freestanding steel framework tower. Before 1989 a 190-metre high self-radiating, free standing steel framework tower was used as a transmission aerial. The Sottens transmitter most recently broadcast the Option Musique radio programme from Radio Suisse Romande, up until 5 December 2010. There is also a 125 metre tall free-standing lattice tower on the site. This tower was built in 1931 as one of a pair, which until 1958 carried between them a T-antenna for medium wave broadcasting. The second tower was dismantled in that year and rebuilt in Dole as a TV transmission tower. This tower is insulated from ground to form a tower radiator and is used as backup antenna. After the shutdown of RSR on MW, the antenna was later used for ham radio experiments in February 2011, using both standard AM and DRM in the 80 m band. ==See also== * Lattice tower ==External links== * Sottens transmitter pictures on emetteurs.ch * * http://www.skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b44084 * http://www.skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b57952 * The Sottens transmitter Retrieved 26 January 2006 * Sottens transmitter Sottens Category:Towers in Switzerland Category:Buildings and structures in the canton of Vaud Category:Broadcast transmitters Category:1931 establishments in Switzerland Category:Towers completed in 1931 ","title":"Sottens transmitter"},{"id":"1270671","text":"Sadowa may refer to: ==Places== * Sadowa, German name for the town of Sadov√° in the Czech Republic * Sadowa, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Voivodeship, a village in central Poland * Sadowa, Masovian Voivodeship, a village in east-central Poland * Sadowa, Ontario, a town in the municipality of Kawartha Lakes, Ontario, Canada * Sadowa Wisznia, Polish name for a small city once part of eastern Poland, now in Ukraine == People == * (born 1985), Polish actress ==Historic events== * Battle of Sadowa (also Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz), the decisive 1866 battle of the Austro-Prussian War ","title":"Sadowa"},{"id":"1270673","text":"Christian Augustus Siebe (known by his middle name; 1788 - 15 April 1872) was a German-born British engineer chiefly known for his contributions to diving equipment. == Contribution to diving == Siebe's design, as refined by 1873. In the 1830s the Deane brothers asked Siebe to make a variation of their smoke helmet design for underwater use. Later they turned to him to produce more helmets for diving operations. Expanding on improvements already made by another engineer, George Edwards, Siebe produced his own design; a helmet fitted to a full length watertight canvas diving suit. The real success of the equipment was a valve in the helmet. Colonel Charles Pasley, leader of the Royal Navy team that used Siebe's suit on the wreck of suggested the helmet should be detachable from the corset, giving rise to the typical standard diving dress which revolutionised underwater civil engineering, underwater salvage, commercial diving and naval diving.

Retrieved 2015-02-20. == The Status of Reserve Officer == Within the Finnish Defence Forces, the vast majority of officers advance through the ranks during their conscription, instead of being commissioned from without for a separate career path. At the end of the basic training of eight weeks, some conscripts are selected for extra training as reserve NCOs (). After the seven-week phase I of the NCO school, usually organised in the brigade the conscript is serving in,Conscript 2015 . Finnish Defence Forces. 2015. ISBN PDF 978-951-25-2598-0. Retrieved 2015-02-20. some NCO students are selected to become Reserve Officers, who are trained at the Reserve Officer School. Both the Reserve NCOs and Reserve Officers serve for 11.5 months, while the majority of rank-and-file conscripts serve for 5.5 months. Reserve Officer School trains reserve officers, most of whom do not continue in active service but are demobilised to the reserve at the end of their conscription. Their service obligation as reservists continues until the age of 60. The reserve officers do not have a military standing while in reserve but when called to active service, reserve officers rank with career officers. The activation may take place for voluntary exercises, for obligatory refresher exercises or, in emergencies, for extraordinary service or for mobilisation.Yleinen Palvelusohjes√§√§nt√∂ , ¬ß¬ß 21, 22, 49.

The training of a reserve officer is also an obligatory prerequisite for attending the National Defence University. Those conscript NCOs who are accepted to the National Defence University, are selected on the condition of passing a platoon-leader course that gives the equivalent training as the Reserve Officer School.Valintaopas 2015: Sotatieteiden kandidaatin ja maisterin tutkintoihin johtavat opinnot Maanpuolustuskorkeakoulu 2015. Retrieved 2015-02-20. == The Training in the Reserve Officer School == After the first seven weeks of the NCO school, those most suitable for Reserve Officer training are selected on the basis of the first phase of schooling and the basic conscript phase. In the Reserve Officer School students receive training for the duties of platoon leader (or equivalent). The curriculum includes studies in leadership, tactics and physical education. After a 3¬Ω-month-long course, they are promoted to officer cadets and sent to their 'home' garrisons to train their wartime platoons from the recruits. After 5 months of service as officer cadets, they are promoted second lieutenants and discharged. Come war, they would ideally lead more or less the same platoon as they led at training time. Traditionally, the training of a reserve officer has carried certain social distinction and has been tied to high positions in industry and economy. E.g. former Nokia CEO Jorma Ollila was the Chairman of his Reserve Officer course. The high educational level of most reserve officers offers the Finnish Defence Forces a chance to fill many wartime vacancies on the basis of civilian professions. For instance, a manager of a civilian transportation company might have a wartime placement as a brigade-level logistics officer. Conscripts who are medical students or doctors are usually given special training to become reserve medical officers. == Other Reserve Officer Training == Some special branches carry out their own reserve officer training. Among these are the Special and Para J√§ger units of Utti Jaeger Regiment and officers for the armoured troops of the Armoured Brigade. Navy reserve officers are trained in Naval Warfare School and Air Force reserve officers in Air Force Academy. Those reserve NCOs who show, during their service in the reserve, exceptional dedication and suitability for officer duties, may be trained on a separate aliupseerista upseeriksi (NCO to officer) course. Typically, they have a civilian occupation or profession that makes them ideal candidates for a wartime position requiring officer training. The FDF website cites ideal examples of a lawyer who would be trained to serve as a wartime military lawyer or a construction engineer who would serve as a heavy earthmoving equipment platoon leader.Aliupseerista upseeriksi reserviss√§ .

And having control or a majority at all levels of state and local government, holding all state level elected offices. ==Current issues== For a long time, same-sex marriages were not allowed in New York, but those marriages from other jurisdictions were recognized. In May 2008, Governor David Paterson issued an affirmation that the state would recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. In December 2009, the senate declined to pass a same-sex marriage bill, though polling earlier that year had indicated that a majority of New Yorkers supported same-sex marriages.http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1318.xml?ReleaseID=1340 Since 2004, the public pension systems of both the state and New York City allocate benefits in recognition of same-sex marriages performed outside New York. Former Governor Eliot Spitzer stated he would introduce legislation to legalize same- sex marriage. On April 27, 2007 then-Governor Spitzer unveiled such a bill. Same-sex marriage was legalized in June 2011. From 1984 through 2004, no budget was passed on time. The state has a strong imbalance of payments with the federal government. New York State receives 82 cents in services for every $1 it sends to Washington in taxes. The state ranks near the bottom, in 42nd place, in federal spending per tax dollar. For decades, it has been the established practice for the state to pass legislation for some meritorious project, but then mandate county and municipal government to actually pay for it. New York State has its counties pay a higher percentage of welfare costs than any other state, and New York State is the only state which requires counties to pay a portion of Medicaid. ==See also== * Government of New York (state) * Elections in New York * Electoral reform in New York * 2009 New York State Senate leadership crisis * C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group ===Topics=== * Alcohol laws of New York * New York divorce law * Gun laws in New York * New York energy law * LGBT rights in New York * Capital punishment in New York * Rent control in New York ==Notes== ==Further reading== * * * ","title":"Politics of New York (state)"},{"id":"1270682","text":"Siebe Gorman Aerorlox oxygen rebreather Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd was a British company that developed diving equipment and breathing equipment and worked on commercial diving and marine salvage projects. The company advertised itself as 'Submarine Engineers'. It was founded by Augustus Siebe , a German-born British engineer chiefly known for his contributions to diving equipment. Siebe plc started in the 1970s as a continuation of Siebe Gorman when Siebe Gorman started to take over other firms, to mean the new conglomerate to distinguish it from Siebe Gorman's original breathing apparatus and diving gear core business. Siebe plc was once one of the United Kingdom's largest engineering businesses. It was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index but in 1999 it merged with BTR plc to form Invensys. Invensys was taken over by the French multinational Schneider Electric for ¬£3.4 billion in January 2014. ==History== *1788: Augustus Siebe was born in Saxony in Germany, named Christian Augustus Siebe.pages 16 etseq, The International History of Diving History vol 4 no. 1, publ. Historical Diving Society He was educated in Berlin and apprenticed to a brass founder. *1812: He served as an artillery officer at the Battle of Leipzig and narrowly escaped death. *1815: He served as an artillery officer in the Prussian army at the Battle of Waterloo. *1816: After that war he moved to London, England. He became a watchmaker, then gunmaker, then instrument maker, and settled at 5 Denmark Street in Soho, London, where he became an engineer. *1819: He started a business as a mechanical engineer at 145 High Holborn, London. He traded as Augustus Siebe and dropped the word \\"Christian\\" from his name. Down the years he produced various mechanical devices, not only diving gear.Invensys: About us *1819: He married Susannah Gliddon (from Devon). *1819: He produced a breech-loading firearm. *1823: He was awarded a Vulcan medal for a screw tap for thread cutting. *1826: He moved to 5 Denmark Street, London, which he rented. *1830: His daughter Mary Siebe was born. The company, by then trading as Siebe Gorman, developed its first diving helmet. (Later, William Augustus Gorman (formerly O'Gorman) (an Irish sea captain) married Mary Siebe.) ===Start of involvement in making diving equipment=== Siebe's design, as refined by 1873. *1830: The Deane brothers asked Siebe to make a variation of their smoke helmet design for underwater use. Later they turned to him to produce more helmets for diving operations. Expanding on improvements already made by another engineer, George Edwards, Siebe produced his own design; a helmet fitted to a full length watertight canvas diving suit (standard diving dress). The real success of the equipment was a valve in the helmet. *1831: He bought 5 Denmark Street's leasehold. He lived and worked there for the rest of his life. *1856: He applied for and was given British citizenship. *1868: He bought the freehold of 5 Denmark Street. *1868: He retired because of old age and ill-health; 4 of his 5 sons had died by this time. *1870: Augustus Siebe passed his business to his son Henry Herapath Siebe and to William Augustus Gorman. The business started trading as 'Siebe & Gorman' *15 April 1872: He died at home of chronic bronchitis. He was buried at the West Norwood Cemetery. *1876: Siebe & Gorman moved to 17 Mason Street (later renamed Boniface Street), Westminster Bridge Road, Lambeth, London. *1878: Henry Fleuss with help from Siebe Gorman designed a practical oxygen rebreather: see Rebreather#History of rebreathers. *1880: The company's name changed to Siebe Gorman & Co. *January 1882: Robert Henry Davis (age 11) (1870‚Äì1965) joined Siebe Gorman as an office boy. Over the years he learned much and became good at breathing apparatus engineering. *1887: Henry Herapath Siebe died aged 57. *1894: Robert Davis was promoted to General Manager of Siebe Gorman. ===20th century=== *September 1900: Robert Davis married Margaret Tyrrell. *1901: Robert Davis's and Margaret Tyrrell's first son Robert William Gorman Davis was born. Over the years Robert William Gorman Davis trained as an engineer and later joined the company. *14 Feb 1904: William Augustus Gorman suddenly died aged 69. (He was buried at Claygate Church in Surrey.) The company became a new private company 'Siebe Gorman & Co. Ltd.'. *1905: The Admiralty set up the first Deep Diving Committee. *1907: The resulting naval diving tables appeared. The Admiralty approached Siebe Gorman to help develop better deep- diving gear. *1907: The Siebe Gorman Proto industrial rebreather starts to be made. The Siebe Gorman Salvus and the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus appeared later. A Siebe Gorman gas mask (without an exhaust valve) exported in large numbers to Egypt *1930: The Admiralty set up the second Deep Diving Committee. *1932; King George V knighted Robert Davis, largely for inventing the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus. *1938: Robert Davis, needing more room for factory expansion, bought 6 acres at Tolworth near Chessington in Surrey. The new building on it was named Neptune Works, on Davis Road. ===WWII=== *1938/39: Siebe Gorman was one of a number of British companies to receive contracts for the manufacture of tens of thousands of gas masks including the British Civilian Duty Respirator (for Civil Defence & related use) and the Respirator, Anti-Gas, Civilian Duty (for general public use). *May 1941: Siebe Gorman's factory in Lambeth was bombed during World War II. Massive loss of company and personal historical records. *1941: The company, already planning to leave London, moved to Chessington, Surrey and resumed manufacturing. It has been speculated (although without any real evidence) that Andr√© Rubber located to the same area in order to supply Siebe Gorman. *June 1943: Siebe Gorman were contracted by the 79th Armoured Division (United Kingdom) to design specialist apparatus for use by the Duplex Drive Tank crews. Known as the Amphibious Tank Escape Apparatus (ATEA) the equipment was fitted with a protosorb canister and enabled it to be used as a re-breather for up to 7 minutes. Tank crews would strap the inflated ATEA to their chests, and in the event of sinking, would fit the mouth piece and nose clips. The equipment was used extensively in training, during which crews perfected its operation in a water-filled cistern as well as on a submerged tank. No doubt it contributed to the saving of many lives especially on D Day where 35% of the tanks that swam towards the Normandy shore sunk due to the poor sea conditions. 1200 men were trained before D Day using the ATEA, and a further 300 for River Crossing.http://www.duplexdrivetanks.co.ukhttp://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1060008292 ===After WWII=== *1948: Siebe Gorman was making aqualungs of the type nicknamed 'Tadpoles'. *around 1950: Peak production of standard diving dress. After this, diving technological development in the USA more and more reduced Siebe Gorman's business, which was halved by the early 1960s. *1951: Birmingham University gave Robert Davis an honorary degree. *1952: Siebe Gorman became a limited company. Robert Davis became its managing director. *1952: Marconi and Siebe Gorman collaborated to produce an underwater television camera system. *1953: Some sport divers find how to make an aqualung regulator out of a Calor gas demand regulator, and spread this knowledge, thus bypassing the naval/industrial monopoly on making usable underwater breathing apparatus. *1954: Around now Siebe Gorman started making Cousteau-Gagnan-type aqualungs, and diving suits for commercial and sport diving. In September 1954, the inaugural issue of the British Sub-Aqua Club magazine Neptune contains a full-page Siebe Gorman advertisementSiebe, Gorman & Co.

The new equipment was safer and more efficient and revolutionised underwater work from the 1830s. Colonel Charles Pasley, leader of the Royal Navy team that used Siebe's suit on the wreck of suggested the helmet should be detachable from the corselet, giving rise to the typical standard diving dress which revolutionised underwater civil engineering, underwater salvage, commercial diving and naval diving. Standard diving suit equipment was their main manufacturing operation, producing diving helmets in copper and brass. They also made frogman's equipment for the British armed forces during World War 2, and later, sport scuba gear. See makes of rebreather. Siebe Gorman and Co manufactured 12 bolt, 8 bolt, 6 bolt, 3 bolt, 2 bolt, no bolt, flange, and 12 bolt square corselet standard diving helmets.

It is a generalization of Cayley's formula which provides the number of spanning trees in a complete graph. Kirchhoff's theorem relies on the notion of the Laplacian matrix of a graph that is equal to the difference between the graph's degree matrix (a diagonal matrix with vertex degrees on the diagonals) and its adjacency matrix (a (0,1)-matrix with 1's at places corresponding to entries where the vertices are adjacent and 0's otherwise). For a given connected graph G with n labeled vertices, let Œª1, Œª2, ..., Œªn‚àí1 be the non- zero eigenvalues of its Laplacian matrix. Then the number of spanning trees of G is :t(G)=\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\lambda_1\\\\lambda_2\\\\cdots\\\\lambda_{n-1}\\\\,. Equivalently the number of spanning trees is equal to any cofactor of the Laplacian matrix of G. == An example using the matrix-tree theorem == The Matrix-Tree Theorem can be used to compute the number of labeled spanning trees of this graph. First, construct the Laplacian matrix Q for the example diamond graph G (see image on the right): : Q = \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{rrrr} 2 & -1 & -1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 3 & -1 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & -1 & 3 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -1 & -1 & 2 \\\\end{array}\\\\right]. Next, construct a matrix Q* by deleting any row and any column from Q. For example, deleting row 1 and column 1 yields : Q^\\\\ast = \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{rrr} 3 & -1 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 3 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & -1 & 2 \\\\end{array}\\\\right]. Finally, take the determinant of Q* to obtain t(G), which is 8 for the diamond graph. (Notice t(G) is the (1,1)-cofactor of Q in this example.) == Proof outline == (The proof below is based on the Cauchy-Binet formula. An elementary induction argument for Kirchhoff's theorem can be found on page 654 of .) First notice that the Laplacian matrix has the property that the sum of its entries across any row and any column is 0. Thus we can transform any minor into any other minor by adding rows and columns, switching them, and multiplying a row or a column by ‚àí1. Thus the cofactors are the same up to sign, and it can be verified that, in fact, they have the same sign. We proceed to show that the determinant of the minor M11 counts the number of spanning trees. Let n be the number of vertices of the graph, and m the number of its edges. The incidence matrix E is an n-by-m matrix, which may be defined as follows: suppose that (i, j) is the kth edge of the graph, and that i < j. Then Eik = 1, Ejk = ‚àí1, and all other entries in column k are 0 (see oriented Incidence matrix for understanding this modified incidence matrix E). For the preceding example (with n = 4 and m = 5): : E = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -1 & -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}. Recall that the Laplacian L can be factored into the product of the incidence matrix and its transpose, i.e., L = EET. Furthermore, let F be the matrix E with its first row deleted, so that FFT = M11. Now the Cauchy-Binet formula allows us to write :\\\\det\\\\left(M_{11}\\\\right) = \\\\sum_S \\\\det\\\\left(F_S\\\\right)\\\\det\\\\left(F^T_S\\\\right) = \\\\sum_S \\\\det\\\\left(F_S\\\\right)^2 where S ranges across subsets of [m] of size n ‚àí 1, and FS denotes the (n ‚àí 1)-by-(n ‚àí 1) matrix whose columns are those of F with index in S. Then every S specifies n ‚àí 1 edges of the original graph, and it can be shown that those edges induce a spanning tree iff the determinant of FS is +1 or ‚àí1, and that they do not induce a spanning tree iff the determinant is 0. This completes the proof. == Particular cases and generalizations == === Cayley's formula === Cayley's formula follows from Kirchhoff's theorem as a special case, since every vector with 1 in one place, ‚àí1 in another place, and 0 elsewhere is an eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix of the complete graph, with the corresponding eigenvalue being n. These vectors together span a space of dimension n ‚àí 1, so there are no other non-zero eigenvalues. Alternatively, note that as Cayley's formula counts the number of distinct labeled trees of a complete graph Kn we need to compute any cofactor of the Laplacian matrix of Kn. The Laplacian matrix in this case is : \\\\begin{bmatrix} n-1 & -1 & \\\\cdots & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & n-1 & \\\\cdots & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots& \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & -1 & \\\\cdots & n-1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}. Any cofactor of the above matrix is nn‚àí2, which is Cayley's formula. === Kirchhoff's theorem for multigraphs === Kirchhoff's theorem holds for multigraphs as well; the matrix Q is modified as follows: * The entry qi,j equals ‚àím, where m is the number of edges between i and j; * when counting the degree of a vertex, all loops are excluded. Cayley's formula for a complete multigraph is mn-1(nn-1-(n-1)nn-2) by same methods produced above, since a simple graph is a multigraph with m = 1. === Explicit enumeration of spanning trees === Kirchhoff's theorem can be strengthened by altering the definition of the Laplacian matrix. Rather than merely counting edges emanating from each vertex or connecting a pair of vertices, label each edge with an indeterminate and let the (i, j)-th entry of the modified Laplacian matrix be the sum over the indeterminates corresponding to edges between the i-th and j-th vertices when i does not equal j, and the negative sum over all indeterminates corresponding to edges emanating from the i-th vertex when i equals j. The determinant of the modified Laplacian matrix by deleting any row and column (similar to finding the number of spanning trees from the original Laplacian matrix), above is then a homogeneous polynomial (the Kirchhoff polynomial) in the indeterminates corresponding to the edges of the graph. After collecting terms and performing all possible cancellations, each monomial in the resulting expression represents a spanning tree consisting of the edges corresponding to the indeterminates appearing in that monomial. In this way, one can obtain explicit enumeration of all the spanning trees of the graph simply by computing the determinant. === Matroids === The spanning trees of a graph form the bases of a graphic matroid, so Kirchhoff's theorem provides a formula to count the number of bases in a graphic matroid. The same method may also be used to count the number of bases in regular matroids, a generalization of the graphic matroids . === Kirchhoff's theorem for directed multigraphs === Kirchhoff's theorem can be modified to count the number of oriented spanning trees in directed multigraphs. The matrix Q is constructed as follows: * The entry qi,j for distinct i and j equals ‚àím, where m is the number of edges from i to j; * The entry qi,i equals the indegree of i minus the number of loops at i. The number of oriented spanning trees rooted at a vertex i is the determinant of the matrix gotten by removing the ith row and column of Q. === Counting spanning k-component forests === Kirchhoff's theorem can be generalized to count -component spanning forests in an unweighted graph. A -component spanning forest is a subgraph with connected components that contains all vertices and is cycle-free, i.e., there is at most one path between each pair of vertices. Given such a forest F with connected components F_1, \\\\dots, F_k, define its weight w(F) = V(F_1) \\\\cdot \\\\dots \\\\cdot V(F_k) to be the product of the number of vertices in each component. Then : \\\\sum_F w(F) = q_k, where the sum is over all -component spanning forests and q_k is the coefficient of x^k of the polynomial : (x+\\\\lambda_1) \\\\dots (x+\\\\lambda_{n-1}) x. The last factor in the polynomial is due to the zero eigenvalue \\\\lambda_n=0. More explicitly, the number q_k can be computed as : q_k = \\\\sum_{\\\\\\\\{i_1, \\\\dots, i_{n-k}\\\\\\\\}\\\\subset\\\\\\\\{1\\\\dots n-1\\\\\\\\}} \\\\lambda_{i_1} \\\\dots \\\\lambda_{i_{n-k}}. where the sum is over all n‚Äìk-element subsets of \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\dots, n\\\\\\\\}. For example \\\\begin{align} q_{n-1} &= \\\\lambda_1 + \\\\dots + \\\\lambda_{n-1} = \\\\mathrm{tr} Q = 2E \\\\\\\\\\\\ q_{n-2} &= \\\\lambda_1\\\\lambda_2 + \\\\lambda_1 \\\\lambda_3 + \\\\dots + \\\\lambda_{n-2} \\\\lambda_{n-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ q_{2} &= \\\\lambda_1 \\\\dots \\\\lambda_{n-2} + \\\\lambda_1 \\\\dots \\\\lambda_{n-3} \\\\lambda_{n-1} + \\\\dots + \\\\lambda_2 \\\\dots \\\\lambda_{n-1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ q_{1} &= \\\\lambda_1 \\\\dots \\\\lambda_{n-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} Since a spanning forest with n‚Äì1 components corresponds to a single edge, the k = n ‚Äì 1 case states that the sum of the eigenvalues of Q is twice the number of edges. The k = 1 case corresponds to the original Kirchhoff theorem since the weight of every spanning tree is n. The proof can be done analogously to the proof of Kirchhoff's theorem. An invertible (n-k) \\\\times (n-k) submatrix of the incidence matrix corresponds bijectively to a k-component spanning forest with a choice of vertex for each component. The coefficients q_k are up to sign the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of Q. == See also == *Pr√ºfer sequence *Minimum spanning tree *List of topics related to trees == References == *. *. *. * == External links == *A proof of Kirchhoff's theorem Category:Algebraic graph theory Category:Spanning tree Category:Theorems in graph theory Category:Gustav Kirchhoff ","title":"Kirchhoff's theorem"},{"id":"1270697","text":"William Drayton (born 1943 in New York City) is a social entrepreneur.

It won two Goya Awards in 1999. The film tells the story of Otto and Ana (whose names are palindromes), from their chance meeting outside school at the age of 8, until they meet again in their 20s in Lapland within the Arctic Circle, under the midnight sun. The themes developed in the film form an important part of Julio Medem's universe, and can be found in his other movies; these include love, death, destiny, nature, the circle of life and the coincidences in life. It received favorable critical reviews.[1] ==Plot== The movie (told from the point of view of the two main characters), opens with Otto (Fele Martinez) hanging from a tree by a parachute after surviving a fateful plane crash. In voiceover he reflects on how he met Ana (Najwa Nimri), his stepsister and secret lover. 17 years before, when Ana and Otto were 8, Otto first sees Ana while rushing to retrieve a soccer ball in the forest outside their school, and is smitten immediately. Ana's voiceover reveals that she was also immediately enamored, but nothing is spoken. She had run into the forest in grief over her father's death and at first she thinks Otto might be her father's reincarnation, but she dismisses the idea after studying her father's photo in an album and finding absolutely no resemblance between them. The next morning Otto writes a question about love on dozens of paper airplanes and sends them flying over the schoolyard. They're read by everyone, including Ana's mother Olga and Otto's father √Ålvaro, who meet for the first time while commenting on this question. After exchanging a few words, √Ålvaro offers Olga and her daughter a ride. Otto hears his father yelling his name, and runs to the car. When he opens the car door, he's shocked to see Ana in the back seat. She greets him warmly and openly; through her point of view we learn that she knows his name from his father's yelling and that she's surprised and delighted to see him again. They ride in the back seat. While their parents talk, Otto's voiceover reveals that he's hopelessly in love with Ana and wonders how she feels about him. Neither child has siblings; Olga is a widow, and Otto's parents are divorced. His mother Yolanda isn't taking that too well. Otto feels sorry for her, but he is thrilled when his father marries Ana's mother: he will be close to his one true love. The story moves forward several years. The two children are now in their middle teens, their unprofessed love fanatically hidden from their parents. Otto's mother has never gotten over her divorce and Otto is a comfort to her. He's concerned about her welfare and feels responsible for keeping her happy, but his longing for Ana overpowers him. Desire finally eclipses responsibility, and Otto moves in with his father, desperate for Ana's love. One night they're doing homework together and they discuss Finland, the Arctic Circle, and the Midnight Sun. They fall silent and Ana rests her head on Otto's chest and listens to his heartbeat. They make out. Soon after, during a family barbecue, Ana passes Otto a note inviting him to her bedroom. That night he goes to her. At last they confront their feelings and become lovers. Several more years pass and we see that they've succeeded in keeping their affair a secret, in spite of the fact that they're conducting it right under their parents' noses. However, Yolanda has sunk deeper into depression since Otto's departure. Finally, feeling abandoned by both husband and son, she commits suicide. Otto, guilt-ridden and bereaved, leaves his father's house one morning without saying a word, and essentially disappears. In utter despair, Ana locks herself in her room and cries, refusing to answer when her mother asks her what's wrong. She leaves home. Becomes a schoolteacher. Time passes. Otto falls into a series of fatuous affairs. During one of them, the subject of his mother comes up. He tells the girl \\"She died of love\\" and when the girl asks \\"How does one die of love?\\" he answers, \\"She died abandoned.\\" Ana and Otto almost meet again in a park. They arrive separately and sit with their backs to each other, each unaware of the other's presence. Otto sits alone; Ana is approached by a man who wants to talk to her. All they would need to do is turn around to see the other sitting there, but this never happens and it's clear that something karmic has been shattered. Ana begins a relationship with the man in the park. Meanwhile, her mother Olga is seduced away from √Ålvaro by another man, also named √Ålvaro, and ends their marriage. Otto returns home to find Ana and Olga gone and his father distraught over Olga leaving him. Running through the story like a thread is the subplot of how Otto got his name: There was a German fighter pilot during WWII named Otto and related to Yolanda, whose plane crashed in Finland. He fell in love with a woman. The other Otto understands that because he has left Ana, he has been left without a destiny. He becomes a pilot like his namesake and flies to Finland, a face which Olga cheerfully communicates to Ana via a video. Soon after, Ana's affair with the man in the park turns dangerously sour and she's forced to get away from him. Olga's lover knows someone who has a cabin in Finland: it's none other than the man for whom Otto was named, the German pilot whose plane crashed during WWII. Olga's lover makes clear that the cabin is just sitting there empty and that the German pilot would willingly let Ana use it until the crisis with her lover blows over. Ana accepts, and writes a letter to her stepbrother: She wants them to meet in Finland. The time has come to reclaim their love. Flying to the cabin, Ana looks out and sees Otto's cargo plane, but doesn't even think that it might be his. Almost simultaneously, Otto looks out the window of his cargo plane and sees the 747 Ana is on, but is equally oblivious. Ana arrives at the cabin, and sits outside in a straight back chair, waiting for Otto to arrive. When he doesn't, she panics. Meanwhile, Otto is hanging from a tree, having survived a plane crash just like his namesake, and getting his parachute caught in the branches. Otto, meanwhile, hangs from a tree, having survived the plane crash just like his namesake. His parachute is caught in the branches...Bringing us to the beginning of the film. Hearing that a cargo plane has crashed, Ana frantically tries to find out if it was Otto's. Tearing through the local newspaper looking for clues, gets hit by a truck on her way across the street. By this time Otto has been rescued and hitched a ride with his rescuers. There's a final, two-part epilogue: In the first part, Ana crosses the street instead of getting hit by the truck. She runs up the stairs of an apartment building and is greeted by the German pilot who tells her that someone inside the apartment is waiting for her. She goes inside and sees Otto who's smiling warmly. They exchange soft words, and she embraces him, making it the perfect reunion. Until it's seen that Ana's eyes are wide open and dilated and that Otto's face is reflected in the lenses. In the second part, Otto and his rescuers have stopped at an intersection. Otto, seeing Ana sprawled on the pavement, gets out of the car and runs to her. It then cuts to their reunion (which is only a dream), and it's revealed that Otto's face in Ana's eyes is the reflection of him leaning over her as she sees him one last time before dying. We see a shot of Otto's destroyed cargo plane in the snow. ==Production== Lovers of the Arctic Circle was shot in Madrid and in various locations in Finland. Julio Medem based part of the film on his own experience of unrequited teenage love for his next door neighbor. He also included a reference to his Basque mother and German father in a scene in which a Basque farmer rescues a stranded German paratrooper. Medem said this was \\"a way of bringing together the two sides of my family.\\" ==Awards== The film was nominated for four Goya Awards and won for Best Editing and Best Original Score. Julio Medem also received the Audience Award at the 2000 Athens International Film Festival and the Audience Award for Best Latin Film at the Gramado Film Festival. The film also won an Ondas Award for Best Spanish Film and Najwa Nimri won for Best Actress. ==References== == External links == * * * Category:1998 films Category:1998 romantic drama films Category:Spanish films Category:Spanish romantic drama films Category:Spanish-language films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Julio Medem Category:Films scored by Alberto Iglesias Category:Films shot in Madrid Category:Films set in the Arctic Category:Films shot in Finland Category:1998 drama films ","title":"Lovers of the Arctic Circle"},{"id":"1270704","text":"Sergeant Major Edgar Foshee, a devout anti-communist, served as a combat medic in the U.S. Army Special Forces.

The story focuses on a high school boy who is allergic to girls who is transported to a mysterious world with a mostly female population; when he returns, one of the girls from that world becomes his housemate. The anime adaptation of Girls Bravo, directed by Ei Aoki and animated by AIC Spirits, aired in Japan from 2004 to 2005. There are 24 episodes total. The anime series was released in English by Geneon, and the manga was released in English by Tokyopop. A visual novel was also released for the PlayStation 2. In July 2010, Funimation Entertainment released a statement on their Twitter feed confirming that they have licensed Girls Bravo. ==Plot== Yukinari Sasaki is an average high school student who is frequently ridiculed by girls to the point that he developed an allergic reaction to them. As a result, he breaks out in hives whenever he comes into contact with a female. One day, when he returns home from school, he is kicked into his bathtub by his neighbor Kirie Kojima, but is transported to , a mysterious world with a mostly female population. He befriends Miharu Sena Kanaka, who ends up following him to Earth. Other Seiren girls with various motives soon visit and join the household. They are taken on many adventures as Miharu discovers the wonders of Earth. ==Characters== ===Main=== ; : Yukinari has been ridiculed by girls all his life, and has developed an extreme case of gynophobia in which he suffers an allergic reaction whenever he comes into contact with one. One day, after he is kicked into his bathtub by Kirie Kojima, his next door neighbor, he is transported to the alien world of Seiren, a planet where men comprise less than 10% of the population. He meets Miharu who does not trigger his allergy. She follows him back to Earth and is the main cause of his misadventures involving girls and subsequent abuse by Kirie. ; : Miharu is a resident of Seiren who pulls Yukinari Sasaki to Seiren and follows him back to Earth to live with him. She has a mark on her forehead shaped like three dots in a triangle called Seikon, which provides her with several powers, including the ability to travel between Seiren and Earth and the power to create explosions whenever she is in emotional distress. She is also the only woman who can touch Yukinari without triggering his allergy. Miharu has a large appetite and a rapid metabolism. On Earth, much of her focus is in questioning her friends as to whether something is edible or not (like butterflies), and her continuous misunderstandings about Earth (such as believing that April Fools' Day means that everyone on Earth lies for one day) are the title's primary source of humor. Despite this, she has a heart of gold, an explorer's fascination with Earth, and has a close relationship with Yukinari. She is an extremely innocent girl who does not show any discomfort with being partially or fully naked in front of Yukinari, and she does not lose her temper even when made the target of Fukuyama's lecherous actions, unless the process involves food or disrupts her eating time. ; : Kirie is Yukinari Sasaki's next door neighbor, classmate, and childhood friend who takes care of him from time to time since. She is especially well-endowed, which makes her a natural target for Kazuharu Fukuyama's perversions. However, due to her physical aptitude and martial-arts abilities, she always defeats him. She regularly beats up Yukinari Sasaki for his bad luck. Kirie inadvertently sends Yukinari to Seiren for the first time when she slugs him for innocently walking in on her when she was showering in his bathroom. Despite their often turbulent relationship, Kirie has a deep affection for Yukinari and usually tries to help him. Because of her strong character and appearance, Kirie attracts a large number of admirers among the boys in her high school. In the manga, Kirie is accosted by an alternate version of Lisa Fukuyama when she enters a parallel world through an enchanted mirror in Fukuyama's house. In the anime adaptation, she also attracts female admirers, specifically Kosame and Hijiri Kanata, much to her displeasure. A running gag throughout the series is Kirie's complete lack of cooking skills which result in the creation of food that is inedible and dangerous. Kirie has a fear of ghosts and the paranormal, and despite her tomboyish character enjoys collecting dolls. ; of which O'Brien received a nomination for Best Actor in a Comedy at the American Anime Awards. : Fukuyama is a classmate of Yukinari Sasaki and Kirie Kojima. Fukuyama is rich, powerful, and perverted, and while he often chases girls and insults Yukinari by calling him , he does show a serious, caring side in critical situations. He suffers androphobia to the point that he has developed an allergy that causes him to break out with a rash whenever he comes into contact with another male. He often appears without the others noticing until he announces his presence, whereupon he either gropes or strips the girls of their clothing, which always earns him a severe beating from Kirie. Despite his own lecherous behavior, Fukuyama is highly protective of his younger sister, Lisa, and strongly objects to her affections for Yukinari. ; : Lisa is Kazuharu Fukuyama's slightly insane younger sister. Lisa is a master of black magic, which causes several issues throughout the series such as infesting her family's mansion with ghosts, summoning a giant octopus in the school swimming pool, and causing an explosion within a shopping center. Lisa is constantly accompanied by Hayate and Kosame, who cater to her every whim such as gathering intelligence or even kidnapping. She develops an infatuation for Yukinari after his appearance matches a description in her horoscope for her soul mate and often employs her magic to get closer to him‚Äîwith predictably disastrous results. Although she considers Miharu a rival, she is very fond of Ebi, who reminds her of the pet cat she owned when she was a little girl. In the anime adaptation, Ebi's girl form reminds her of a doll she used to spend her days with, which she reunites with later on thanks to Tomoka's magic. ; : Koyomi is an androphobic resident of Seiren. She has fear of men on Earth and her phobia is only made worse by being one of Kazuharu Fukuyama's favorite targets; in the manga, she keeps a diary of how many times he has accosted her. Originally sent to Earth on a mission from the Space Travel Agency to 'retrieve' Miharu Sena Kanaka, she later moves into Yukinari's house along with her companion Tomoka Lana Jude on a prolonged mission to find a husband for Miharu's sister Maharu. However, her fear of men makes the act of even talking to a man nearly impossible. Koyomi's favorite pastime is reading, but she has a natural talent for table tennis, having won a tournament for a similar sport on Seiren. In the anime adaptation, Koyomi is also searching for her father, a native of Earth, whom she eventually reunites with. Koyomi's mother possessed a Seikon mark, and Koyomi herself possesses a dormant form of Seikon allowing her to create a portal to Seiren after Miharu is kidnapped by Hijiri Kanata. After she loses in Fukuyama's Cosplay Mahjong game, she is forced to wear nothing but a python, which she later ironically adopts as a pet. ; : Tomoka is a resident of Seiren who is sent to aid Koyomi Hare Nanaka in finding Miharu's older sister Maharu a groom after her less than productive efforts. Although a child, Tomoka deeply resents being treated as one and insists that she is as mature as anyone else, despite frequent actions by her which prove otherwise. She gets along fairly well with Fukuyama, whom she later refers to as an older brother after the two team up to obtain some mutual objective. She has developed a small crush on him but it is not something he is aware of. Tomoka can also use transformation magic. In the anime adaptation, Tomoka frequently uses Ebi as a makeshift club for hitting almost anything and anyone; she becomes friends with Lisa after conceding defeat in a magical duel. She is also obsessed with Poyon, her favorite TV show character. Because she is a child, Tomoka is able to have contact with Yukinari without triggering his female allergy. She also looks up to Kirie as an older sister. For example, she follows Kirie's example of drop-kicking Fukuyama right in the face. Tomoka is later revealed to be a genius capable of instantly answering a complex math equation from a college entrance exam. ;] In the Mahjong episode, Voiced by Fumihiko Tachiki (Japanese); Dameon Clarke (English) : Ebi is a creature from Seiren that resembles a plump miniature seal with the face of a cat and a pair of large bobbing antenna, which causes Miharu to claim she resembles a shrimp (ebi is the Japanese word for shrimp). She is accidentally summoned by Miharu during a bath, and becomes a pet for Miharu and the girls. In the anime adaptation, Tomoka pulls her out of her bag. She suffers a great deal of torment at the hands of Tomoka, who uses her as a club, flail, fishing bait, or handball. When Tomoka transforms Ebi into a girl for a brief amount of time, Yukinari and Kirie pay more attention to the transformed Ebi than to her. In the anime episode where the gang play Mahjong, Ebi is able to think through the entire play in her mind but is unable to communicate the move to novice Tomoka, rendering her plan fruitless. Also in the anime, Ebi can shoot a powerful beam attack called the E-beam from her mouth although it takes a while to recharge. ===Supporting=== ; : Maharu is Miharu's well-endowed older sister. She is very determined and will not hesitate to use violence to get her way. Although initially jealous of Miharu's relationship with Yukinari Sasaki, she eventually gives them her blessing. Much to Yukinari's dismay, that does not stop her from flirting and fondling him whenever she gets a chance. Due to Seiren's low male population and the fact that she is close to 30, Maharu assigns both Koyomi and Tomoka to find a man of her own on Earth. Though flirtatious, she is, in fact, quite picky by Seiren standards, rejecting Kazuharu Fukuyama immediately upon discovering his perverted nature. In the epilogue for the anime adaptation, she proposes to Hayate. Despite proposing to him, getting married in the manga, and giving Yukinari and Miharu her blessing, she is still obsessed with Yukinari, loves him, flirts with him, and wants to be with him. Maharu is voiced by Sayaka Ohara in Japanese and by Karen Thompson in English. Kotono Mitsuishi provides her voice for the Drama CDs. ; : Lilica is the Fukuyamas' chief maid. She is stoic and polite, even when Kirie destroys some expensive equipment. However, she shows shock when Kirie and Yukinari introduce themselves as Fukuyama's friends. She later reveals that she has fought in military operations in Bosnia, Somalia, Chechnya, and Afghanistan. She is highly intelligent and is sometimes seen with a laptop which operates mechanical devices within the Fukuyama mansion, and also a spy satellite, which explains how Kazuharu Fukuyama constantly finds Koyomi and the others. In the anime adaptation, Lilica places Mamoru Machida as an apprentice after being impressed by his desire to clean the world. She is also occasionally hinted to be in love with Fukuyama. Lilica is voiced by Natsuko Kuwatani in Japanese and by Wendy Tomson in English. ; : Hayate is one of Lisa Fukuyama's attendants. While he only makes a handful of appearances in the manga, Hayate in the anime forms a strong rivalry/friendship with Tomoka, and the two occasionally battle one another in friendly duels. Hayate is a very calm, loyal, and serious individual who will go to great lengths for his mistress, Lisa; this usually involves doing some sort of research or private investigating. Tomoka nicknames him \\"ninja\\" because of his stealthy ways, only revealing himself when attending to Lisa, or to attack. Hayate is voiced by Takanori Hoshino in Japanese and by Patrick Seitz in English. ; : Kosame is Lisa Fukuyama's second attendant. In the anime adaptation, Kosame is also a considerably stronger fighter than Kirie Kojima, and after fighting with Kirie, she falls in love with her. Her obsession is so strong that just being in Kirie's presence is enough to make Kosame either grope or make some other pass at her, which usually requires Hayate to rein her in. When not fawning over Kirie, Kosame is as stoic a figure as Hayate and frequently uses her gun to either pry information out of others or to force them into doing her bidding. Kosame is voiced by Nozomi Masu in Japanese and by Robin Rhodpa in English. ; : Nanae is Koyomi and Tomoka's superior in the Space Travel Agency. Nanae is in charge of the missing persons department and assigns agents to find and retrieve residents of Seiren who have accidentally been transported to Earth. In the anime adaptation, she helps Maharu Sena Kanaka contact Yukinari so that the others can rescue Miharu. Nanae is voiced by Yukiko Iwai in Japanese and by Rita Stevens in English. ; :Mamoru is an obsessive-compulsive classmate of Yukinari Sasaki's. He dons an alter-ego, Lightning Squadron Mamo Ranger - a parody of the Super Sentai series - in the pursuit of his passion for cleaning and pointing out litterbugs, although at first glance his 'squadron' consists of only him. Extremely accident prone, he tends to cause more problems than he solves, whereupon his deluded sense of reality causes him to blame his \\"villainous opponents.\\" He later drafts the others into the Mamo Rangers, although they want absolutely nothing to do with it. In the anime adaptation, Mamoru becomes an apprentice to Lilica which turns him from a mild annoyance into a serious threat to public safety. Mamoru is voiced by Hiroyuki Yoshino in Japanese and by Sam Regal in English. ; : Hijiri is a strict guidance counselor who joins Yukinari's high school. In the anime adaptation, she serves as a subordinate for Yukina, whose mission is to observe and eventually kidnap Miharu. Hijiri had been obsessed with Miharu since they were both children, and Yukina promises to give Miharu to her in exchange for helping her achieve her goals. However, Hijiri is eventually defeated by Kirie, and forgets about Miharu and begins to obsess over Kirie instead. Hijiri is voiced by Aya Hisakawa in Japanese and by Erica Shaffer in English. ;Mrs. Sasaki :Mrs. Sasaki is Yukinari Sasaki's mother. As Yukinari keeps Miharu Sena Kanaka a secret from her, Mrs. Sasaki begins to fear that the strange occurrences in her house were due to a ghost, but eventually decides not to worry about it since all the \\"ghost\\" did was eat all the food. She later leaves Yukinari to be with his father, who is on a business trip. ; Vegetable Store Keeper : A local grocer who befriends Miharu at the start of the series, and gives her the nickname Banana Girl. He is voiced by Takashi Nagasako in Japanese and by Doug Stone in English. ; : A character exclusive to the anime adaptation, The Boss is an overweight and soft-spoken thug dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and is usually accompanied by an exuberant man in a blue leisure suit. The thugs cross pass Yukinari Sasaki and his friends throughout the series. However, after Miharu Sena Kanaka is kidnapped by Hijiri Kanata, the Boss helps Yukinari realize that the only way to get Miharu back is to fight for her with everything he has got. When his friend later asks why he never spoke before, the Boss tells him that he simply never had anything to say. The Boss is voiced by Toshihide Tsuchiya in Japanese and by J.C. Miller in English. ; : A ghost who has been haunting the Fukuyamas' private hot spring. Last winter, she was bathing at the spring when a pervert caught and groped her. When she tried to catch him, she slipped on a wet rock, hit her head and died. In order to move on to the afterlife, she wants to catch a pervert. Lisa suggests they re-enact the scene, and volunteers Yukinari and herself, although Hakana accidentally possesses Kirie instead. When Kirie tries to resist the groping, Hakana realizes that Kirie likes Yukinari. When Kirie and Yukinari hug, Hakana is freed; she thanks the group and tells Kirie what a wonderful person Yukinari is. She is voiced by Ai Shimizu in Japanese and by Tara Platt in English. ; : A character exclusive to the anime adaptation, Yukina is the ruthless leader of the Space Management Bureau's Special Forces Division in Seiren, who also has the power of Seikon. Because of her slight build and Seikon markings covering her body, Yukina felt that no man would ever love her and developed a condition that causes her to break out in hives upon contact with men. Her illness and anti-masculine prejudices are what cause Yukina to decide that if she cannot be loved by men then no one in Seiren can. Eventually, Yukina has her subordinate Hijiri Kanata send Miharu Sena Kanaka back to Seiren to permanently seal the gateway to Earth using her power, making Seiren a \\"woman-only paradise\\". But after being shown kindness by Yukinari Sasaki, Yukina falls in love with him and releases Miharu. Yukina is voiced by Sakura Nogawa in Japanese and by Elise Baughman in English. ==Media== ===Manga=== Written and illustrated by Mario Kaneda, the manga was originally serialized in 2000 in Kadokawa Shoten's Sh≈çnen Ace magazine and has since been released in 10 tank≈çbon volumes.

The proposals, dubbed the \\"China Plan\\", were prompted by the United States Congress's successful lobbying of President Bill Clinton to grant a visa to Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui.

Sieong sat with Bill Clinton or Al Gore at two fund-raising events. Sioeng also joined Fong at a meeting with then Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich in mid-1995. Gingrich called the meeting a \\"photo op\\". Gingrich was the guest of honor at a Sioeng-organized luncheon the day after a Sioeng family company gave the $50,000 think-tank donation, solicited by a Gingrich adviser. Attorney General Janet Reno and the directors of the FBI, CIA and National Security Agency (NSA) told members of the Senate committee they had credible intelligence information indicating Sioeng acted on behalf of China. A spokesman for Sioeng denied the allegations.Woodward, Bob and Duffy, Brian \\"Senate Panel Is Briefed on China Probe Figure\\" , The Washington Post, September 12, 1997 Sioeng left the country shortly thereafter, and no charges were filed. ==Investigations== === Department of Justice investigation === Attorney General Janet RenoThe Justice Department opened a task force in late 1996 to begin investigating allegations of campaign fund-raising abuses by the Clinton/Gore re-election campaign. It expanded its internal investigation to include activities related to President Bill Clinton's legal defense fund in December 1996.\\"Justice To Expand Inquiry To Clinton's Legal Fund\\" , CNN.com, December 19, 1996 President Clinton announced in February 1997 that he thought there should be a \\"vigorous\\" and \\"thorough\\" investigation into reports that the People's Republic of China tried to direct financial contributions from overseas sources to the Democratic National Committee. The president stopped short of calling for an independent prosecutor, saying that was the decision of the Justice Department. \\"[O]bviously it would be a very serious matter for the United States if any country were to attempt to funnel funds to one of our parties for any reason whatever,\\" President Clinton said.\\"Clinton Wants Probe Of Possible Chinese Involvement\\" , CNN.com, February 13, 1997 By July 1997, the administration determined that no evidence of any such thing had yet been proven. \\"We have received the relevant [FBI] briefings,\\" White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said. \\"We believe there's no basis for any change in our policy toward China, which is one of engagement.\\"Harris, John F., \\"White House Unswayed By China Allegations\\" , The Washington Post, July 20, 1997 \\"I do not know whether it is true or not,\\" President Clinton stated. \\"Therefore, since I don't know, it can't... and shouldn't affect the larger long-term strategic interests of the American people in our foreign policy.\\" Members of Congress of both parties reached disparate conclusions. According to The Washington Post, Senator Fred Thompson (a Republican from Tennessee) and chairman of the committee investigating the fund-raising controversy, said he believed the Chinese plan targeted presidential and congressional elections while Democratic Senators Joe Lieberman and John Glenn said they believed the evidence showed the Chinese targeted only congressional elections. === Congressional investigations === With regard to their overall efficacy, investigators are on record as having stated that the Congressional investigations were hamstrung due to lack of co- operation of witnesses.

Jalebi, also known as Jilapi, zulbia, mushabak and zalabia, is an Indian and Arabic sweet snack popular all over South Asia and Middle East. It is made by deep-frying maida flour (plain flour or all-purpose flour) batter in pretzel or circular shapes, which are then soaked in sugar syrup. This dessert can be served warm or cold. They have a somewhat chewy texture with a crystallized sugary exterior coating. Citric acid or lime juice is sometimes added to the syrup, as well as rose water. Jalebi is eaten with curd or rabri (North India) along with optional other flavours such as kewra (scented water). This dish is not to be confused with similar sweets and variants like imarti and chhena jalebi. == Names == Names for the dish include South Asia: * (jalebi); * Nepali: ‡§ú‡•á‡§∞‡•Ä (jeri); * Marathi: ‡§ú‡§ø‡§≤‡§¨‡•Ä (jilabƒ´); * (jilƒÅpi); * (jelepi); * (jalƒìbƒ´); * (jilƒìbi); * (jilƒìbi); * (jhilƒÅpi); * (jalƒìbƒ´); * (jilƒìbi); * (jilƒìbi); * ; * Sinhala: ‡∂¥‡∑ê‡∂´‡∑í ‡∑Ä‡∑Ö‡∂Ω‡∑î (p√¶·πái va·∏∑alu); * (jalebi); * (jalebi); West Asia * (zulbia); * (≈∫…ôlob…ôi); * Central Kurdish: ÿ≤€ÜŸÑÿ®€åÿßÿå ÿ≤ŸÑÿßÿ®€å€ï (zolb√Æya, zilab√Æye); * Southern Kurdish: ÿ≤ŸàŸàŸÑÿ®€åÿßÿå ÿ≤ŸàŸàŸÑ€åÿ®€åŸÑ€åÿß (z√ªlb√Æya, z√ªl√Æb√Æl√Æya); * Lurish: ÿ≤ŸÑŸá€åÿ®€å (zuleybi); * Azerbaijani: z√ºlbiy…ô * Arabic: ÿ≤ŸÑÿßÿ®ŸäŸá (zalƒÅbiyeh) or ÿ≤ŸÑÿ®Ÿä (zalebi); * Turkish: m√º≈üebbek, z√ºlbiye North Africa * Somali: ŸÖŸèÿ¥Ÿéÿ®ŸéŸÉ (mushabbak); * Egyptian Arabic: ŸÖŸêÿ¥Ÿéÿ®ŸçŸÉ (meshabek); * Tunisian Arabic: ÿ≤ŸÑÿßÿ®ŸäŸá (zlebia); * Harari language: ·àô·àª·â†·äΩ (mushabakh).

A 10th century cookbook gives several recipes for zulubiya. There are several 13th century recipes of the sweet, the most accepted being mentioned in a cookbook by Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi. It was also mentioned in a tenth century Arabic cookbook by Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq, that was later translated by Nawal Nasrallah. Ernest A Hamwi, a Syrian immigrant to the United States, is believed to have used the Persian version zalabia as an early ice cream cone. === Modern jalebi === According to Hobson- Jobson, the Indian word jalebi is derived from the Arabic word zulabiya or the Persian zolbiyaHobson-Jobson, s.v. \\"JELAUBEE\\", another name for luqmat al qadi.This recipe was brought to Medieval India by Persian-speaking Turkic invaders. In 15th century India, jalebi was known as Kundalika or Jalavallika. Priyamkarnrpakatha, a work by the Jain author Jinasura, composed around 1450 CE, mentions jalebi in the context of a dinner held by a rich merchant. Gunyagunabodhini, another Sanskrit work dating before 1600 CE, lists the ingredients and recipe of the dish; these are identical to the ones used to prepare the modern jalebi. The western Asian dish of Zalabia used a different batter and a syrup of honey and rose water, It was in India that the Indian jalebi got its distinct form - crispness, colour and the sticky sweetness. == Distribution == === Indian subcontinent === In the Indian subcontinent, it is known as Jalebi in Hindustani and served with sweetened condensed milk dish, rabri or eaten with kachori and vegetable curry in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. In Bangladesh, this sweet is called Jilapi in Standard Bengali or Zilafi in some places in eastern Bangladesh such as Sylhet and Chittagong, and it is broadly consumed as an essential iftar item or as a snack. This sweet is called jeri in Nepal, a word derived from Jangiri and the Mughal Emperor Jahangir. Pani Walalu or Undu Walalu is a traditional sweet of Sri Lanka prepared by frying a type of doughnut, made by using undu flour and rice flour and soaking in kithul treacle. In the Maldives, it is known by the name \\"zilƒìbi\\". === Middle East and North Africa === ==== Iran ==== It's known as zoolbia (ÿ≤ŸàŸÑÿ®€åÿß) in Iran, although when translated into English, the spelling has alternatives and can include zolbiya, zulbiƒÅ, zulbia, zolbia, and others. In addition to being sweetened with honey and sugar, zoolbias in Iran is also flavoured with saffron or rose water. Often in Iran, zoolbia is served with Persian-style black tea alongside a similar dessert with a different \\"egg\\" shape, Bamiyeh. These deserts are commonly served during Nowruz (Persian New Year) and Ramadan month. ==== Middle East and North Africa ==== Zlebia or zlabia is a type of pastry eaten in parts of Northwest Africa, such as Algeria, Tunisia and Libya as well as Morocco. Natural ingredients include flour, yeast, yoghurt, and sugar or honey. This is then mixed with water and commonly two seeds of cardamom (oil for the crackling). These are found in the Levant and other Middle Eastern countries, including the Arab countries of Yemen, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Comoros. ZalƒÅbiya or zalabia, zalabiya (ÿ≤ŸÑÿßÿ®Ÿäÿ©) (Maghrebi Arabic: ÿ≤ŸÑÿßÿ®Ÿäÿ©) are fried dough foods, including types similar to straight doughnuts. ZalƒÅbiya are made from a batter composed of eggs, flour and milk, and then cooked in oil. They are made by a zalbƒÅni. Unlike jalebi, zalabia may have a different shape, more like a free-form doughnut or a ball (but this is depending on the exact region and culture), and it may contain cinnamon, lemon, and powdered sugar. == Variations of the recipe == ZalƒÅbiya mushabbaka are latticed fritters made in discs, balls and squares. They are dipped in clarified honey perfumed with rose water, musk and camphor. A recipe from a caliph's kitchen suggests milk, clarified butter, sugar and pepper to be added. ZalƒÅbiya funiyya is a \\"sponge cake\\" version cooked in a special round pot on a trivet and cooked in a tannur.Translated by Nawal Nasrallah Annals of the caliphs' kitchens: Ibn SayyƒÅr al-WarrƒÅq's tenth- century Baghdadi cookbook Volume 70 of Islamic history and civilization Edition illustrated 2007 . 867 pages BRILL page 413-417 They are often stick shaped.

Its sequels are \\"The Ungoverned\\", which was a novella published in his collection True Names and Other Dangers, and the novel Marooned in Realtime. The Peace War and Marooned in Realtime were collected in Across Realtime (Baen Books, 1991). ==Plot== The story takes place in 2048, 51 years after scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory develop \\"the ultimate weapon\\", a force field generating device they term a Bobbler. The bureaucracy running the Laboratory use it to enforce an end to conventional warfare (triggering a brief war in the process), calling themselves the Peace Authority. The Bobbler creates a perfectly spherical, impenetrable, and persistent shield around or through anything, and is used to contain nuclear weapons, people, and occasionally entire cities or governments, separating them from the rest of the world (and presumably killing everyone inside by eventual suffocation and lack of sunlight). In an effort to retain their monopoly on this weapon, they make technological progress illegal, and their power and fear of rebellion corrupts them. In this world, governments are weak, where they are permitted at all; the Peace Authority is the true bearer of power and becomes a worldwide government. A group of rebels, the Tinkers, develop technology clandestinely far beyond what the Authority has (while limited to riding horseback and other Authority-mandated anachronisms), but still has no defense against the bobble. One of the original inventors of the bobble is part of the resistance, and he develops a more advanced version of the bobbler which does not require the huge electrical power sources available only to the Peace Authority. It is discovered by the Tinkers (and much later by the Peace Authority) that the bobbles are actually not force fields, but stasis fields; within which time has stopped. So not only are the contents perfectly preserved, but they open spontaneously after a certain time period. The Tinkers use their knowledge and the Peacers' ignorance of this effect to their advantage (bobbling themselves for short time periods, for instance), and with the help of a young thief (and mathematical genius), they lead a rebellion to try to bobble the power generators of the Peace Authority and thus neutralize its primary weapon. ==References== == External links == * *The Peace War at Worlds Without End Category:American science fiction novels Category:Transhumanist books Category:1984 American novels Category:1984 science fiction novels Category:Novels by Vernor Vinge Category:Novels first published in serial form Category:Works originally published in Analog Science Fiction and Fact ","title":"The Peace War"},{"id":"1270791","text":"Charles \\"Chuck\\" Koen (1945 ‚Äì July 20, 2018) was an African-American minister and civil rights activist from Cairo, Illinois who served as prime minister of the Black Liberators and the executive directors of the Black United Front Cairo.

It is taken by mouth for up to a few weeks. After a few weeks the beneficial effects no longer occur. It is also available as the combination phentermine/topiramate. Common side effects include a fast heart beat, high blood pressure, trouble sleeping, dizziness, and restlessness. Serious side effects may include pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, and abuse. Use is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Use is not recommended together with SSRIs or MAO inhibitors. It works as an appetite suppressant likely as a result of being a CNS stimulant. Chemically, phentermine is a substituted amphetamine. Phentermine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1959. It is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost of a month supply in the United States is about US$2.55. In 2017, it was the 210th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions. Phentermine was withdrawn from the market in the United Kingdom in 2000 while the combination medication fen-phen, of which it was a part, was withdrawn from the market in 1997 due to side effects. ==Medical uses== Phentermine is used for a short period of time to promote weight loss, if exercise and calorie reduction are not sufficient, and in addition to exercise and calorie reduction. Phentermine is approved for up to 12 weeks of use and most weight loss occurs in the first weeks. However, significant loss continues through the sixth month and has been shown to continue at a slower rate through the ninth month. ==Contraindications== Phentermine use is contraindicated in those who: * have a history of drug abuse. * are allergic to sympathomimetic amine drugs. * are taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) or have taken one within the last 14 days. * have cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, or glaucoma. * are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breast-feeding. ==Adverse effects== Rare cases of pulmonary hypertension and cardiac valvular disease have been reported. Tolerance usually occurs; however, risks of dependence and addiction are considered negligible. People taking phentermine may be impaired when driving or operating machinery. Consumption of alcohol with phentermine may produce adverse effects. There is currently no evidence regarding whether or not phentermine is safe for women who are pregnant. Other adverse effects include: * Cardiovascular effects like palpitations, tachycardia, high blood pressure, precordial pain; rare cases of stroke, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac failure and cardiac arrest have been reported. * Central nervous system effects like overstimulation, restlessness, nervousness, insomnia, tremor, dizziness and headache; there are rare reports of euphoria followed by fatigue and depression, and very rarely, psychotic episodes and hallucinations. * Gastrointestinal effects include nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, cramps, unpleasant taste, diarrhea, and constipation. * Other adverse effects include trouble urinating, rash, impotence, changes in libido, and facial swelling. ==Interactions== Phentermine may decrease the effect of drugs like clonidine, methyldopa, and guanethidine. Drugs to treat hypothyroidism may increase the effect of phentermine. ==Mechanism of action== frame Phentermine has some similarity in its pharmacodynamics with its parent compound, amphetamine, as they both are TAAR1 agonists, where the activation of TAAR1 in monoamine neurons facilitates the efflux, or release into the synapse, of these neurochemicals. At clinically relevant doses, phentermine primarily acts as a releasing agent of norepinephrine in neurons, although, to a lesser extent, it releases dopamine and serotonin into synapses as well. Phentermine may also trigger the release of monoamines from VMAT2, which is a common pharmacodynamic effect among substituted amphetamines. The primary mechanism of phentermine's action in treating obesity is the reduction of hunger perception, which is a cognitive process mediated primarily through several nuclei within the hypothalamus (in particular, the lateral hypothalamic nucleus, arcuate nucleus, and ventromedial nucleus). Outside the brain, phentermine releases norepinephrine and epinephrine ‚Äì also known as noradrenaline and adrenaline respectively ‚Äì causing fat cells to break down stored fat as well. ==History== In 1959, phentermine first received approval from the United States FDA as an appetite-suppressing drug. Eventually a hydrochloride salt and a resin form became available. Phentermine was marketed with fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine as a combination appetite suppressant and fat burning agent under the popular name fen-phen. In 1997, after 24 cases of heart valve disease in fen-phen users, fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine were voluntarily taken off the market at the request of the FDA. Studies later showed nearly 30% of people taking fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for up to 24 months had abnormal valve findings. Phentermine is still available by itself in most countries, including the US. However, because it is similar to amphetamine, it is classified as a controlled substance in many countries. Internationally, phentermine is a schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.Convention on Psychotropic Substances (PDF file) In the United States, it is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. In contrast, amphetamine preparations are classified as Schedule II controlled substances. A company called Vivus developed a combination drug, phentermine/topiramate that it originally called Qnexa and then called Qsymia, which was invented and used off-label by Thomas Najarian, who opened a weight-clinic in Los Osos, California in 2001; Najarian had previously worked at Interneuron Pharmaceuticals, which had developed one of the fen-phen drugs previously withdrawn from the market. The FDA rejected the combination drug in 2010 due to concerns over its safety. In 2012 the FDA approved it after Vivus re-applied with further safety data. At the time, one obesity specialist estimated that around 70% of his colleagues were already prescribing the combination off-label. ==Chemistry== Phentermine is a substituted amphetamine which has a methyl group on amphetamine's alpha carbon. It is a positional isomer of methamphetamine and other methylamphetamines. The molecular formula of phentermine is . ===Synthesis=== Phentermine can be produced from benzaldehyde and 2-nitropropane as follows: # Benzaldehyde and 2-nitropropane are cross-reacted in a variant of the Henry reaction # The nitro group is reduced with hydrogen gas over Raney nickel catalyst # The hydroxyl group is chlorinated with thionyl chloride to yield 2-amino-1-chloro-2-methyl-1-phenylpropane # This is reduced with hydrogen gas over a palladium on magnesium glycinate catalyst to yield the product, phentermine ==Society and culture== ===Names=== Phentermine is contracted from _phen_ yl- _ter_ tiary-butyla _mine_. Phentermine is marketed under many brand names and formulations worldwide, including Acxion, Adipex, Adipex-P, Duromine, Elvenir, Fastin, Ionamin, Lomaira (phentermine hydrochloride), Panbesy, Qsymia (phentermine and topiramate), Razin, Redusa, Sentis, Suprenza, and Terfamex. ==ReferencesCategory:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate Category:Amphetamine Category:Anorectics Category:Carbonic anhydrase activators Category:Management of obesity Category:Norepinephrine releasing agents Category:Phenethylamines Category:Substituted amphetamines Category:TAAR1 agonists ","title":"Phentermine"},{"id":"1270798","text":"The Battle of Cerro Gordo, or Battle of Sierra Gordo, was an engagement in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War on April 18, 1847. The battle saw Winfield Scott's United States troops outflank Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna's larger Mexican army, driving it from a strong defensive position. ==Background== After United States forces captured the port of Veracruz on March 29, 1847, General Winfield Scott advanced towards Mexico City on April 2 by crossing the Rio Antigua.Bauer, K.J., 1974, The Mexican War, 1846‚Äì1848, New York: Macmillan, General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, commanding Mexican forces in the area, had prepared fortifications at Cerro Gordo, near Xalapa, with more than 8,700 soldiers in a fortified defile, dominated by El Telegrafo. These included several batteries under the command of brigadier generals Luis Pinzon, Jose Maria Jararo, and Romulo Diaz de la Vega. Scott's leading division, commanded by David E. Twiggs, reached the Cerro Gordo Pass on April 12. ==Battle== Leg amputation of sergeant Antonio Bustos, practiced by the Belgian surgeon Pedro Vander Linden, who is holding the amputated leg, during the Mexican-American war, it is considered the first daguerrotype of an amputation on the battlefield. On April 12, Lieutenant Pierre G. T. Beauregard, of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, determined that possession of Atalaya Hill would enable the Mexican position to be turned. The Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant observe that, in order to determine whether a flanking movement was possible, \\"reconnaissances were sent out to find, or to make, a road by which the rear of the enemy's works might be reached without a front attack.\\" These reconnaissances were made under the supervision of Captain Robert E. Lee and other officers, \\"all of whom attained rank and fame.\\" Grant continues that it was the roadways constructed by the engineers which achieved victory: Twiggs' division took the hill on April 17, advancing up the slopes to El Telegrafo. Santa Anna reinforced El Telegrafo with Brigadier General Ciriaco Vasquez's 2d Light, 4th, and 11th Infantry. Captain Edward J. Steptoe set up his battery on Atalaya Hill and Major James C. Burnham set up a howitzer across the river. At 7:00 am on April 18, Twiggs directed William S. Harney's brigade to move against the front of El Telegrafo while Bennett C. Riley attacked from the rear. The combination easily took the hill, killing General Vasquez, and Captain John B. Magruder turned the Mexican guns on the retreating Mexicans. Simultaneously, James Shields' brigade attacked the Mexican camp and took possession of the Jalapa road. Once they realized they were surrounded, the Mexican commanders on the three hills surrendered and by 10:00 am, the remaining Mexican forces fled. ==Aftermath== Santa Anna, caught off guard by the Fourth Regiment of the Illinois Volunteer Infantry, was compelled to ride off without his artificial leg, which was captured by U.S. forces and is still in possession of the Illinois State Military MuseumIllinois State Military Museum in Springfield, Illinois. In the U.S. the prosthetic inspired song parodies. Showman P.T. Barnum claimed acquired it for display in his museum. The prosthetic was eventually donated to the state of Illinois, where it was displayed in its military museum. A visiting Mexican official was apparently embarrassed at seeing the trophy displayed, and it was removed. It was later the subject of controversy about its return to Mexico.Wagenen, Michael Scott.

Initially built by the telegraph battalion of the German Army, operation began during World War I in 1916. On 22 December 1920, the transmission of a Christmas concert marked the birth of public broadcasting in Germany. ==History== Barracks of the telegraph battalion, K√∂nigs Wusterhausen (postcard, about 1915) The German armed forces had conducted experiments in radio technology on the Windm√ºhlenberg hill northwest of K√∂nigs Wusterhausen since 1911, with mobile stations mounted on horse carriages and antennas held up by captive balloons. Extended signal corps facilities were erected at the site from 1913 onwards, including a large antenna system and several functional buildings. Later called Senderhaus 1, the military broadcasting station was put into operation in 1916. After the war, the German Reichspost took over the barracks with effect from September 1919 and used the facilities for the transmission of weather reports, financial news, and telegrams. Radio broadcasting was initiated by post official Hans Bredow and his staff when they used an arc converter supplied by C. Lorenz AG for the first transmission of speech and music in the longwave range on 22 December 1920, making K√∂nigs Wusterhausen the \\"cradle of German broadcasting\\". After private radio reception was authorised by law in 1923, transmissions quickly developed throughout the Weimar Republic. The facilities soon had to be enlarged and a second station building (Sendehaus 2) was inaugurated in 1923 Repair work on the Central Tower, 1931 At K√∂nigs Wusterhausen, a nationwide Deutschlandsender transmitter was erected in 1925, then consisting of several masts with heights from up to and the high Central Tower. It was soon followed by a longwave transmitter in nearby Zeesen (Deutschlandsender II) and the first public shortwave transmitter for international broadcasting (Weltrundfunksender), built by the Telefunken company and inaugurated in August 1929. After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, these facilities were extensively used for propaganda purposes. With the end of World War II, K√∂nigs Wusterhausen was part of the Soviet occupation zone and several masts were taken down by order of the military government, though the station remained in use for broadcasting in East Germany. The Central Tower collapsed during the Cyclone Quimburga on 15 November 1972. At the date of German reunification in 1990, there was only one high mast with a longwave aerial, two masts for a T-aerial for medium wave and some small towers. The remaining transmitters for mediumwave, shortwave and longwave were shut down between 1992 and 1999 and the whole area was transformed into a museum, which is marked by the 210-metre-high mast. For mobile phone services and low power FM broadcasting, a 67-metre-high free-standing tower of concrete was built in 1994. == See also == * List of transmission sites * List of tallest structures ==References== == External links == * * skyscraperpage.com Category:Radio masts and towers in Germany ","title":"K√∂nigs Wusterhausen radio transmitter"},{"id":"1270850","text":"Melchior Klesl (sometimes Khlesl, rarely Cleselius) (19 February 1552 ‚Äì 18 September 1630) was an Austrian statesman and cardinal of the Roman Catholic church during the time of the Counter-Reformation. Klesl was appointed Bishop of Vienna in 1598 and elevated to cardinal in 1616. ==Biography== Born in Vienna to Lutheran Protestant parents, with his father being a baker, Melchior Klesl studied philosophy at the University of Vienna, and was with his parents converted by the court chaplain, Father Georg Scherer, S.J. He received minor orders in 1577, when he was assigned a canonry, and, even while in minor orders, he preached and held conferences at Korneuburg and in the vicinity, making many conversions. In 1579 he became doctor of philosophy and provost of St. Stephen's in Vienna, which dignity carried with it the chancellorship of the university, and was finally ordained to the priesthood. As early as the following year he was appointed councillor of the Bishop of Passau for Lower Austria. Rudolf II, impressed by the vigour and success of his campaign against Protestantism, entrusted him with the work of the Counter-Reformation, which became his life work. Klesl brought back into the fold the cities of Baden, Krems, and Stein, though not without great difficulty, nor indeed without actual risk of his life. In 1585 he was made imperial councillor by Rudolf II, who three years later appointed him court chaplain and administrator of the Diocese of Wiener Neustadt. It took him but a very short time to restore the Catholic rule in this thoroughly disorganized bishopric. He was compelled in doing so to be constantly on his guard against the monastic council, which, in a memorial on the subject, he calls, \\"the cause of all evil, the champion of godless prelates and priests against their bishop, a parasite\\". In 1598 Klesl was named Bishop of Vienna, a diocese which was spiritually and materially in a state of degradation. On 30 Mar 1614, he was consecrated bishop by Placido della Marra, Bishop of Melfi e Rapolla.\\"Melchior Cardinal Klesl \\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org. David M. Cheney. Retrieved December 17, 2016 He received the purple from Paul V in 1616. In 1611 Matthias placed Klesl at the head of his privy council. As such he held full sway in the government, stoutly opposing the concessions to the Hungarian Protestants in 1606. He assisted to secure the election of Matthias to the imperial throne, and sought, but without success, to strengthen the new emperor's position by making peace between the Catholics and the Protestants. When during the short reign of Matthias the question of the imperial succession demanded prompt attention, the bishop, although quite as anxious as his opponents to retain the empire in the house of Habsburg and to preserve the dominance of the Roman Catholic Church, advised that this question should be shelved until some arrangement with the Protestant princes had been reached. This counsel was displeasing to Archduke Maximilian of Tyrol and to Archduke Ferdinand of Styria, who after the O√±ate treaty became King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor as Ferdinand II. They believed that Klesl was hostile to the candidature of the latter prince. It was, however, impossible to shake his influence with the emperor. In June 1618, a few months before the death of Matthias, the Bohemian Estates, having thrown their governor out of the window of the palace at Prague for the second time, broke out into open rebellion. Klesl could not be induced to take energetic measures against them and was seized by order of the archdukes and imprisoned at Schloss Ambras in Tyrol. A short time later he was formally arrested by Cardinal Fabrizio Verospi and brought to the castle of Innsbruck, whence he was transferred to the monastery of St. Georgenberg in 1619. In November 1622, Rome, Italy became his place of confinement by order of Pope Gregory XV. He was granted his freedom by the emperor in June of the following year, but was to remain in Rome. Klesl lived to enjoy the satisfaction of seeing himself solemnly brought back to Vienna on 25 January 1628, and reinstated as bishop, but without any political influence. He decreed that the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December be henceforth observed in his dioceses \\"in the same manner as Sundays and other prescribed holy days\\", and in spite of the nuncio's protestation, he strove to maintain the peculiarly Viennese custom whereby Holy Communion was distributed on Good Friday. He died in Wiener Neustadt in 1630. His heart reposes before the high altar of the cathedral of Wiener Neustadt while his body rests in the cathedral of St. Stephen's, Vienna. Inhabitants of Vienna will recognize Klesl's name first and foremost because Khleslplatz (Khlesl Square) in Vienna's 12th district, Meidling, in the former village of Altmannsdorf, has been named after the cardinal, allegedly because he used to stop at No.12 on his journeys from Wiener Neustadt to Vienna. Since 1978, the 16th century building has housed the Renner-Institut, the political academy of the Social Democratic Party of Austria, while No.6 was, until 1998, the site of the Tierschutzhaus of the Wiener Tierschutzverein (founded in 1846), where generations of animal lovers would go to collect homeless pets. ==Episcopal succession== While bishop, he was the principal consecrator of: *P√©ter P√°zm√°ny, Archbishop of Esztergom (1617); *Lilio Livioi, Auxiliary Bishop of Constantinople (1625); *Vincenzo Martinelli (bishop), Bishop of Conversano (1625); and *Giovanni Battista Maria Pallotta, Titular Archbishop of Thessalonica (1628). ==References== * * ==Further reading== *Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, Khlesl's, des Cardinals, Directors des geheimen Cabinetes Kaiser Mathias, Leben.

The kontusz was a long robe, usually reaching to below the knees, with a set of decorative buttons down the front. The sleeves were long and loose, on hot days worn untied, thrown on the back. In winter a fur lining could be attached to the kontusz, or a delia worn over it. The kontusz was usually of a vivid colour, and the lining was of a contrasting hue. The kontusz was tied with a long, wide sash called a pas kontuszowy. The kontusz was more of a decorative garment than a useful one. Tradition states that the first kontusze were worn by szlachta who captured them from Ottomans to display as loot. Throwing kontusz sleeves on one's back and stroking one's moustache was considered to be a signal of readiness for a fight. In 1776, Sejm deputies from different voivodeships of Poland were obliged to wear different coloured ≈ºupany and kontusze denoting their voivodeships.

He was born on November 26, 1949, in Moshav Alonei Abba. In the course of his career, he has sold over 1.5 million albums, making him one of Israel's most successful male singers. ==Biography== Artzi's parents were Holocaust survivors and their memories deeply influenced him and his sister Nava Semel, a playwright. His father, Yitzhak Artzi, a Zionist activist in Bukovina, Romania in his youth, was later a member of the Knesset, his maternal grandmother, was the sister of Rabbi Meir Shapiro. When Artzi was eight years old, his family moved to northern Tel Aviv. Artzi's schoolmates thought he would become an actor, not a musician, as he was known for his acting skills at elementary school. However, at the age of twelve he started playing the guitar and singing in a boy scouts group and at friends' parties. At age 16, he began writing and composing songs. During his military service, he was recruited to the Artillery Corps, and after serving for a year and a half, he joined Lehakat Kheil Hayam (Naval Corps Entertainment Group). During his service in the group, he took part in the programs \\"And on the Third Day\\" and \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\", alongside other soon-to-be Israeli celebrities, such as Rivka Zohar, Dov Glikman, Avi Uriah, Riki Gal, and more. He was yet to stand out during the first program, but by the second program he became the lead singer and one of the main stars. He sang lead vocals on several songs on the Group's LPs. In 1970, Artzi had the opportunity to take part in the Israeli Song Festival, a prestigious song contest held every year. Still in military service and wearing a military uniform, he sang Pitom Achshav, Pitom Hayom (Suddenly Now, Suddenly Today), also known as Ahavtiha (I loved her). The song, written by Tirza Atar and composed by Ya'akov Hollander, won first prize. It was included in his first album, Shlomo Artzi, which came out in 1970, and came in first in the annual chart-toppers countdown of Kol Israel. Artzi was voted Singer of the Year. In 1977, after a string of failures, he decided to make one last record \\"the way a record should be made.\\" The success of this album, \\"A Man Gets Lost\\" ( ◊í◊ë◊® ◊î◊ï◊ú◊ö ◊ú◊ê◊ô◊ë◊ï◊ì,Gever Holekh Le'ibud), persuaded Artzi to continue with his singing career, which rose throughout the 1980s and reached a peak with the release of the albums \\"Dance\\" (Tirkod) and \\"Restless Night\\" (◊ú◊ô◊ú◊î ◊ú◊ê ◊©◊ß◊ò,Layla Lo Shaket) which sold tens of thousands, and with the live shows that accompanied these albums, which would sell out the largest parks and theatres in Israel. His later album sales, in excess of a hundred-thousand per album, and the live shows that followed each album, made him the most popular artist in Israel; Based on album sales and gross income from live shows, he is the most successful singer in Israel. Artzi has sold a total of over a million and a half albums, an unprecedented achievement in the Israeli music industry. He is well known for his marathon live shows, some of which last over two or even three hours. ==Musical career== Shlomo Artzi with his son, Ben In 1975 he was selected to represent Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest. The selected song was At Ve'Ani (You and Me), written by the legendary Israeli songwriter Ehud Manor, and composed by Artzi himself. To seize the moment, Artzi's record label pressured him to record a completely new record in less than 2 weeks. However, At Va'Ani didn't win the contest, and the album was a big disappointment. This marked the beginning of the worst era of Artzi's career. During the next several years, Artzi released several records that failed to sell well, and produced very few hit singles. Later, most of these albums would become rare collectibles, as they were never released again. These include, among others, Miskhakey 26, Shlomo Artzi Shar U'Mesaper Al Ian HaGamad, Yesh Li Isha Yalda Ve'Lambreta Ve'Ani Gar Be'Tel-Aviv, Romansa U'Piyut, and a selection of his best songs from the period 1970‚Äì1973, which was released in 1976. In 1977, almost ready to give up on a singing career, Artzi wished to record one last album \\"the way a record should be made\\", and was allowed to do so by the record company. He recorded A Man Gets Lost, a sort of last good-bye to the business. Nevertheless, the album was a big success and revived Artzi's career, which from this moment on would rise, and keep rising, to unprecedented heights in the Israeli music industry. In 1979 he recorded Drachim (Roads), with a fresher style. His 1981 LP Chatzot (Midnight) was the second part of Drachim. In 1980 Artzi started his own radio show on Israel's Military Radio station, Galey Tzahal. In this show, he talked about the week's headlines and tells interesting stories he has heard or seen during the week. Od Lo Shabat (It isn't Saturday yet) still broadcasts every Friday at 13:10 local time. His records Tirkod (Dance, 1984), \\"Layla Lo Shaket\\" (Restless Night, 1986), and Hom Yuli August (July August Heat, 1988), are milestones of Israeli 1980s songwriting. The albums sold in excess of a hundred thousand copies, an unprecedented achievement in the Israeli music industry, and the live shows that accompanied the albums would sell out even the largest parks and theatres in Israel. In 1992 Artzi released Yareakh (, Moon), one of his most successful albums. Out of twelve songs on it, eight became radio hits and finally solidified Artzi's status in Israeli popular music. In 1995 popular Israeli musicians recorded together a CD in memory of Yitzhak Rabin, named Shalom Chaver. Shlomo Artzi played two songs during the memorial service, which later became anthems of those days ‚Äì Haish Ha'hu (That Man) and Uf Gozal (Fly Little One), which was originally written and recorded by Arik Einstein and Miki Gavrielov. In 1996 Artzi released a double album called Shnayim (\\"Two\\"), which has sold an almost unprecedented 160,000 copies, making it a certified 4x platinum record. The most notable songs in this CD were the title track, sung with Israeli singer Rita, \\"Hi Lo Yoda'at Ma Over Alay\\" (\\"She Doesn't Know What I'm Going Through\\"), '\\"Menagev Lach Et Hadmaot\\" (\\"Wiping The Tears For You\\") \\"Ze Ma Shenish'ar\\" (\\"That's What's Left\\"), \\"Ha'ahava Hayeshana\\" (\\"The Old Love\\"), \\"Le'an, Le'an, Le'an\\" (\\"Where, Where, Where\\"), \\"Shisha\\" (\\"Six\\"), \\"Absurd\\" and \\"Dokh Retzhakh\\" (\\"Murder Report\\") which reflected on the tragedy of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination and revolved it around another similar tragedy, that of JFK's assassination. Shnayim signaled the beginning of a string of ultra-popular albums of original material from Artzi, which are some of the best selling Israeli records of all time. In 2000 Artzi released \\"Ahavtihem\\" (\\"I Have Loved Them\\"), a collection of reworked love songs, many of which originally written by him for other artists. The album featured many smash hits, including the tender revision of his past hit \\"Ahavtia\\" (\\"I Have Loved Her\\"), \\"Nof Yaldoot\\" (\\"Childhood's View\\"), \\"Anakhnu Lo Tzrikhim\\" (\\"We Don't Need\\"), \\"At Va'ani\\" (\\"You And Me\\"), \\"Ma'avir Duff\\" (\\"Turning The Page\\") ‚Äì a duet with Nurit Galron (which performed the song originally), \\"Shir Preda\\" (\\"A Goodbye Song\\") ‚Äì a duet with his singer-songwriter son, Ben Artzi and \\"Melekh Ha'olam\\" (\\"King of the World\\", a Hebrew translated cover of White Plains' \\"When You Are A King\\"). The album went on to sell over 200,000 copies ‚Äì an unprecedented achievement in the little Israeli music market. Artzi's next original album, \\"Tzima'on\\" (\\"Thirst\\"), which was released in 2002, featured the title track as its lead single, as well as the more memorable \\"Al-Pi Tnuat Harakavot\\" (\\"According to the Trains' Movement) LeHatzil Otakh (\\"To Save You\\") and \\"Ptzatzat Atom Bashamaim\\" (\\"Atom Bomb in the Sky\\"). The albums were an instant smash hit, selling over 60,000 copies (3x gold record) on the first two weeks of their release and continued the enormous success of their predecessors, yet they were met with harsh reviews, some of which noted the inadequate abundance of quality material. Artzi would later admit of the albums' weakness in select few interviews. In 2007 Artzi released his highly anticipated follow-up album, \\"Shfuim\\" (\\"Sane\\"). The album came out in July, with a lead single \\"Ha'amiti\\" (\\"The Real\\") which was received with by-now standard heavy radio rotation. The album generated several more radio singles to help push it, yet they repeatedly failed to make a lasting impression on fans. The colorless clutter of \\"Iceland\\" and the disappointingly stale and un-melodic collaboration with Mooke (of the breakthrough Rap-Rock band Shabak Samekh), \\"Hakhaim\\" (\\"Life\\"), hinted of a waning creativity of the nation's favorite singer-songwriter. Fourth single finally managed to get a hook across and join Artzi's rich back catalog with pride: \\"Nitzmadnu\\" (\\"We Clinged\\"), enjoying a catchy sing-along melodic line and an interesting lyric, sharing private memories and reflecting on , among other topics, television's role inside a modern family and on Prime Minister Yitzkhak Rabin's Assassination (a recurring subject in Artzi's songs). Finally came out one of Artzi's biggest, most enduring and most memorable songs of recent years, \\"TeTa'aru Lakhem\\" (\\"Imagine Yourselves\\"), which features one of the best-known, most beloved lines in Artzi song catalog, equipped with a tender, infectious, eternally romantic message: \\"Imagine yourselves a beautiful world, a little less sad than it actually is, and there we are, walking, with sunshine in our pockets\\". The song is still a major live-show staple and highlight. In 2012 Artzi finally released a yet- again highly anticipated album of original songs: \\"Osher Express\\" (\\"Happiness Express\\"). This time around, though, the album enjoyed both critical acclaim as well as commercial success. It featured a very strong collection of new songs, a slew of beloved singles and an intriguing, immediately classic lead- off single: \\"Khozrim Habaita\\" (\\"Coming Home\\") which featured the ultra popular, rarely seen on public, iconic Israeli singer Arik Einstein. The album kept shooting off powerful material and rapidly so. Quite quickly came the similarly addictive \\"Kol Yom\\" (\\"Every Day\\"), the life-affirming duet with Dudu Tasa \\"Latet Velakakhat\\" (\\"Negotiating\\"), and the spiritual duet with Abraham Tal \\"Elohim\\" (\\"God\\"). Additional singles came in the form of \\"Nedaber Mehalev\\" (\\"We'll Talk Whole-Heartedly\\") and \\"Shelo Yealmu Hadvarim Hayafim\\" (\\"Wish That The Beautiful Things Won't Disappear\\"). Album gems also included the heartfelt and captivating title track, the part-playful, part heart-on-sleeve honesty of \\"Ometz\\" (\\"Courage\\"), the epic escapism obsession tackle of \\"Florida\\", and Artzi's unique narration on the wave of social protests that hit Tel Aviv in 2012, \\"Kaitz Be'eretz Lu\\" (\\"Summer in If-Land\\"). in 2016, Artzi released a new album: \\"Katzefet\\" (cream). ==Personal life== Artzi has been married twice, and has three children from his first marriage: Ben Artzi (singer), Shiri Artzi (author married to actor, Yiftach Klein) and Jonathan Artzi. Today, Artzi resides in Tel Aviv. He is known as a fan of the soccer team Maccabi Netanya. In 1971, Artzi composed Maccabi Netanya's championship song. ==References== * Shlomo Artzi: Biography, by MSN Music. * Biography, by Billboard.com ==External links== * * Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 1975 Category:Israeli composers Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants for Israel Category:Israeli male film actors Category:Israeli film score composers Category:Israeli Jews Category:Israeli male singers Category:Israeli people of Romanian-Jewish descent Category:Israeli people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:Israeli pop singers Category:Israeli male singer-songwriters Category:People from Northern District (Israel) Category:Israeli singers Category:Israeli singer-songwriters Category:Male film score composers Category:Israeli military musicians ","title":"Shlomo Artzi"},{"id":"1270861","text":"The Northwest Railway Museum (NWRM) is a railroad museum in Snoqualmie, King County, Washington. Constructed in 1889 by the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway (SLS&E;), it was Seattle's response to the Northern Pacific's selecting Tacoma as their terminus. The SLS&E; was later absorbed by the Northern Pacific.Snoqualmie Depot; National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form; David M. Hansen, Washington State Parks & Recreation Commission; Washington, D.C.; July 24, 1974 ==Snoqualmie Depot== The Snoqualmie depot was built in 1890 by the SLS&E.; The Snoqualmie Station represents a type of building that once was in every community of any size across the nation. Good architecture was good advertising and enhanced company pride. The station once served as the terminal for this early recreation area. An atypical design created as a rural combined freight-passenger depot with lavish decorations to reflect the holiday spirit of the vacationers. Visitors came to enjoy hunting and fishing as well as Sunday excursions to Snoqualmie Falls. The station is a large frame building about with a generous eaves. A bay window on the track side is the station office. The semicircular north end stands out in this design. The eaves are supported by wooden pillars and diagonal braces and scroll work decorates the intersection of the braces with the eaves and the pillars. The current structure was modified from the original, in which the bay window continued up through the roof and formed an octagonal tower a full story in height. A two sash window with a semicircular upper sash appeared on each face of the tower and a prominent cornice separated the tower body from the steeply pitched roof. The roof was decorated with fancy butt shingles and capped with a finial. A large swept dormer was placed in the southern part of the main structure above the freight section, Cast iron cresting and fancy butt shingles decorated the roof of both the main body and the transverse dormer. The freight dock, was wider originally and ran the length of the entire rear third of the station, is now a small porch in front of a single sliding freight door. The Snoqualmie Depot is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, ID #74001963. ==Museum== The Northwest Railway Museum was founded in 1957 as the Puget Sound Railway Historical Association and took its current name in September 1999. The mission of the organization is to develop and operate an outstanding railway museum where the public can see and understand the role of railroads in the development of the Pacific Northwest, and experience the excitement of a working railroad. The museum's collection also includes a variety of railway cars and locomotives that document that development of the railway in Washington from the 1880s through the 1960s, including the Messenger of Peace Chapel Car which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It also includes a 3,000-volume library and archives that focus on the history of railroads in the Northwest, and on technical and other engineering aspects of railroading. ==Heritage railroad== The Northwest Railway Museum also operates a heritage railroad called the Snoqualmie Valley Railroad. This common carrier railroad allows museum visitors to experience a train excursion aboard antique railroad coaches through the Upper Snoqualmie Valley. Trains operate on Saturdays and Sundays from April through October and in December, and carry over 47,000 passengers per year. ==Restoration Center== In August 2006 the Museum dedicated the new Conservation and Restoration Center (CRC), phase one of the Railway History Center. The CRC is a place to perform collection care on large rail artifacts including locomotives, coaches, and freight cars. It features , two full length inspection pits, and is used to perform many functions once conducted in railroad backshops.

He advocated extremism and armed guerrilla warfare against the U.S. government and what he called its \\"Jewish power structure.\\" Tommasi wanted anarchy and lawlessness so that the \\"system\\" could be attacked without protection. Tommasi was derisively nicknamed \\"Tomato Joe\\" by rival neo-Nazis because of his Italian heritage and \\"less than Nordic complexion.\\" ==Politics== Influenced by William Luther Pierce, Tommasi first rose to prominence as a young leader within the National Socialist White People's Party (NSWPP), later called the American Nazi Party, in Arlington County, Virginia. In 1969, Tommasi launched the National Socialist Liberation Front (NSLF) as a youth wing of the American Nazi Party. In 1970, David Duke joined the organization. In February 1972, Irv Rubin, a Jewish militant of the Jewish Defense League, was arrested after firing at Tommasi. The NSWPP had splintered following the 1967 murder of George Lincoln Rockwell, and Tommasi frequently found himself at odds with Rockwell's successor, Matthias Koehl. Koehl, a strait-laced follower of Adolf Hitler, objected to Tommasi's radical viewpoints, as well as his personal habits, which included smoking marijuana, wearing long hair, listening to rock and roll and inviting a girlfriend for sex at NSWPP headquarters. These led to Tommasi being ejected from the NSWPP in 1973. In March 1974, Tommasi launched the NSLF as a separate organization. The group attracted many of the younger and more radical members of the NSWPP. It used propaganda, such as pictures showing the twisted wreckage of a Bank of America branch. Tommasi sought membership among white college students who felt alienated by both the radical leftist movement as well as the mainstream conservative right. However, Tommasi had not given up trying to regain control of the NSWPP. ==Death== On August 15, 1975, Tommasi was killed by a single bullet to the head in front of the headquarters of the NSWPP, his rival group, in El Monte, California. Numerous weapons were found at the headquarters, including a gun that had been recently fired. David Rust, who was with Tommasi at the time, stated that someone had directed an obscene gesture towards them. Witnesses said that Tommasi walked into the front yard carrying a club and got into an argument. One member allegedly told him that if he came any closer, he would be shot. Jerry Keith Jones, 18 years old, was suspected in the murder. Tommasi was buried at Rose Hills Memorial Park. ==Legacy== Tommasi's life inspired fellow neo-Nazi James Mason to revive the NSLF in the early 1980s as a leaderless \\"philosophical concept or a state of mind\\" called Universal Order and to resurrect Tommasi's \\"Siege\\" periodical. ==Publications== *Building the revolutionary party Chillicothe, Ohio : National Socialist Liberation Front * POLITICAL TERROR (1974 leaflet) ==References== ==External links== * The Post- war Paths of Occult National Socialism: From Rockwell and Madole to Manson by Jeffrey Kaplan Category:1951 births Category:1975 deaths Category:American people of Italian descent Category:American neo-Nazis Category:Murdered politicians Category:Leaders of political parties in the United States Category:American murder victims Category:Deaths by firearm in California ","title":"Joseph Tommasi"},{"id":"1270867","text":"Susan Mary Woodford-Hollick, Baroness Hollick OBE (born 16 May 1945) is a British businesswoman and consultant with a wide-ranging involvement in broadcasting and the arts.

There were two clear strategic objectives which emerged from Channel 4. More people from the ethnic communities should be making programmes, serving an apprenticeship if necessary. There were, inevitably headcounts of the number of ethnic faces appeared on-screen as newsreaders, reporters, presenters or actors.

Acid-fastness is a physical property of certain bacterial and eukaryotic cells, as well as some sub-cellular structures, specifically their resistance to decolorization by acids during laboratory staining procedures. Once stained as part of a sample, these organisms can resist the acid and/or ethanol-based decolorization procedures common in many staining protocols, hence the name acid-fast. The mechanisms of acid-fastness vary by species, although the most well-known example is in the genus Mycobacterium, which includes the species responsible for tuberculosis and leprosy. The acid-fastness of Mycobacteria is due to the high mycolic acid content of their cell walls, which is responsible for the staining pattern of poor absorption followed by high retention. Some bacteria may also be partially acid-fast, such as Nocardia. Acid-fast organisms are difficult to characterize using standard microbiological techniques, though they can be stained using concentrated dyes, particularly when the staining process is combined with heat. Some, such as Mycobacteria, can be stained with the Gram stain, but they do not take the crystal violet well and thus appear light purple, which can still potentially result in an incorrect gram positive identification. The most common staining technique used to identify acid-fast bacteria is the Ziehl-Neelsen stain, in which the acid-fast species are stained bright red and stand out clearly against a blue background. Another method is the Kinyoun method, in which the bacteria are stained bright red and stand out clearly against a green background. Acid-fast Mycobacteria can also be visualized by fluorescence microscopy using specific fluorescent dyes (auramine-rhodamine stain, for example). The eggs of the parasitic lung fluke Paragonimus westermani are actually destroyed by the stain, which can hinder diagnosis in patients who present with TB-like symptoms. ==Some acid-fast staining techniques== * Ziehl‚ÄìNeelsen stain (classic and modified bleach types) * Kinyoun stain * For color blind people (or in backgrounds where detecting red bacteria is difficult), Victoria blue can be substituted for carbol fuchsin and picric acid can be used as the counter stain instead of methylene blue, and the rest of the Kinyoun technique can be used.Theory and Practice of Histological Techniques, John D Bancroft, 6th ed, p314 ** Various bacterial spore staining techniques using Kenyon e.g. *** Moeller's method *** Dorner's methodDorner, W. 1926.

The nickname \\"Eagles\\" goes back to 1920 when Rev. Edward McLaughlin, unhappy at seeing a newspaper cartoon which represented Boston College as a cat after a track victory, wrote to the college newspaper The Heights: ==Live birds-of-prey== The \\"Eagles\\" nickname stuck. Soon a pair of golden eagles from Texas and New Mexico were given to the college as gifts. Sadly, one escaped and the other broke its beak trying. For the next four years, the official \\"mascot\\" was a stuffed golden eagle located in the athletic offices. In 1961, another attempt was made at a live mascot when the college adopted a 10-month-old golden eagle named \\"Margo\\" (so named because the team colors are maroon and gold). Margo lived at the Franklin Park Zoo and was brought to all home games for several years until dying of a virus early in the 1966 season. In 2013, new athletic director Brad Bates brought back the live eagle tradition, bringing in an eagle during half time of football games. After a fan contest to decide what to call the Eagle, it was named \\"Welles\\" after Welles Crowther, the hero who died helping others during the September 11 attacks; a BC alum. Welles made sparing appearances in 2013 and 2014, sometimes not being able to attend the games due to inclement weather, late start times, etc. ==Gilded statue== Another notable incarnation of the Boston College Eagle is a gilded bronze eagle sculpture that diplomat Larz Anderson and Isabel Weld Perkins, his socialite heiress wife, brought back from Japan in the early 20th century.\\"The PDF Walking Tour Guide published by the Larz Anderson Auto Museum notes \\"The bronze eagle that perched on a stone plinth in the garden may reference the Anderson family's military service. In Japan, the eagle is a Guardian (sic), warding off evil spirits. In this county, the eagle is used as a symbol of the United States. It is also the symbol of the Society of the Cincinnati, of which Larz was a member.\\" The eagle remained in Larz Anderson Park until 1954 when it was donated to Boston College and became synonymous with the BC Eagle. It now looks over Linden Lane.Donovan, Charles F. \\"History of Boston College: From the Beginnings to 1990\\"; University Press of Boston College, September 1990, p.266 ==Costumed mascot== By the time Margo died in 1966, eagles had become endangered species and the university then opted to go to a costumed mascot. In 2000, with the unveiling of the current athletics logos, the Boston College Eagle mascot received a visual makeover as well and has appeared that way since. Also, the mascot officially got the name \\"Baldwin\\"‚Äîa combination of the words \\"Bald\\" (as in bald eagle) and \\"win.\\" There is also a 9.5 foot inflatable mascot named \\"Baldwin, Jr.\\" which appears at games. Like many modern costumed mascots, Baldwin wears replica team uniforms at events. Baldwin the Eagle is brought to life by an anonymous team of Boston College students that are chosen by audition.According to the Baldwin Website on December 1, 2006, BC was holding auditions to add to its \\"team of Eagles.\\" ==See also== *List of U.S. college mascots ==References== __NOTOC__ Category:Boston College Eagles Category:Atlantic Coast Conference mascots Category:Fictional birds of prey ","title":"Baldwin the Eagle"},{"id":"1270905","text":"Marooned in Realtime is a 1986 murder mystery and time-travel science fiction novel by American writer Vernor Vinge, about a small, time-displaced group of people who may be the only survivors of a technological singularity or alien invasion. It is the sequel to the novel The Peace War (1984) and the novella The Ungoverned (1985). Both novels and the novella were collected in Across Realtime. Marooned in Realtime won the Prometheus Award in 1987 and was also nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel that same year. == Plot summary == In the story, a device exists that can create a \\"bobble\\", a spherical stasis field in which time stands still for a specified length of outside time, allowing one-way time travel into the future. The bobble can also be used as a weapon, a shield against other weapons, for storage, for space travel (combined with nuclear pulse propulsion), and other purposes. People whose bobbles burst after a certain date in the 23rd century find the Earth completely devoid of human life, with only ambiguous clues as to the cause; possibilities include alien attack and humanity transcending to a new level of existence as a result of a technological singularity. The \\"low-techs\\" ‚Äî those who bobbled earlier ‚Äî have roughly late-21st-century technology. The \\"high- techs\\" ‚Äî those who had the advantage of ever accelerating progress ‚Äî have vastly superior technology, including cybernetic enhancements, faster and thought-controlled bobblers, personal automaton extensions of self, space ships, medical technology to allow practical immortality (barring accidents or fatal injuries), and individual arsenals greater than those of entire 20th century countries. Of the high-techs, even those who bobbled at slightly different times have significantly different technology levels. The protagonist is Wil Brierson, a detective who also was the protagonist of the preceding novella, The Ungoverned. Some time after the events in The Ungoverned, Brierson was unwillingly bobbled 10,000 years into the future while he was investigating a routine theft, cutting him off forever from his wife and children. Yel√©n and Marta Korolev, a high-tech couple, have spent 50 \\"megayears\\" (million years) gathering together all the survivors they can find to rebuild civilization, with the ultimate goal of creating their own technological singularity. They calculate that they will have just enough genetic diversity to pull it off once the bobble containing about a hundred members of the Peace Authority bursts. Before one of their routine bobbles while waiting for that bobble to expire, the Korolevs' computers are hacked, and Marta is excluded from the automated bobbling. She is left stranded in \\"realtime\\", cut off from all advanced technology. Worse, the hacker has extended the duration of the bobbling far beyond what was intended, and Marta dies alone on a deserted Earth. When the \\"murder\\" is discovered, Yel√©n Korolev hires the low-tech Brierson to find the killer, who has to be one of the seven high-techs (Brierson does not rule out Yel√©n herself as a suspect). Della Lu, a high-tech who was an agent of the Peace Authority during The Peace War, agrees to assist Brierson with the technical aspects of the case. In the millions of years since the singularity, Della had spent most of her 9,000 years alone, exploring the galaxy. She discovered that intelligent life is extremely rare, and there were parallel vanishings in the few civilizations she found, but no definitive proof of the cause. The singularity is implied to be an explanation for the Fermi Paradox. The novel thus deals with the investigation of two parallel locked room mysteries: the murder of Marta Korelev, and the \\"locked planet\\" mystery of the disappearance of the human race. Brierson interviews each of the high-techs, seeking evidence of any motive for murder while discussing their views on why the human race vanished. When the killer thinks Brierson is getting too close, Brierson, Korolev and Della Lu are horrified to discover that the criminal is able to gain control of all of the high-tech systems, except for Della's, and attacks. Della manages to defeat their combined forces, but at a ruinous cost: much of their equipment and about half of what remains of humanity are lost. Brierson, however, not only unmasks the murderer, he reveals the identity of another monster in their midst and finds a way to restore a second chance for mankind. == References == == External links == * *Review by Jo Walton * Marooned in Realtime at Worlds Without End Category:1986 science fiction novels Category:Transhumanist books Category:1986 American novels Category:Novels by Vernor Vinge Category:Novels about time travel Category:Novels first published in serial form Category:Works originally published in Analog Science Fiction and Fact Category:Post-apocalyptic novels Category:Novels about extraterrestrial life ","title":"Marooned in Realtime"},{"id":"1270907","text":"A quad helix (or quadhelix) is an orthodontic appliance for the upper teeth that is cemented in the mouth. It is attached to the molars by 2 bands and has two or four active helix springs that widen the arch of the mouth to make room for crowded teeth, or correct a posterior cross-bite, where lower teeth are buccal (outer) than upper teeth. It is usually made from 38 mil stainless steel wire and is primarily indicated in mixed dentition, cleft patients and those that have performed the act of thumbsucking. A variety of this appliance is inserted into attachments that are welded to the bands. In this way the orthodontist can adjust the appliance without removing the bands. The precursor to the quad-helix was the coffin spring. Similar devices known as tri-helices and bi-helices were later developed, with three and two helix springs, respectively. The expander works by gently pushing the teeth outwards to eventually widen the upper arch.

It is Metro Manila's only electric power distributor and holds the power distribution franchise for 22 cities and 89 municipalities, including the whole of the National Capital Region and the exurbs that form Mega Manila. The name \\"Meralco\\" is an acronym for Manila Electric Railroad And Light Company, which was the company's original name until 1919. ==History== ===La Electricista=== Organized in 1891 and beginning operations in late 1894, La Electricista was the first electric company to provide electricity to Manila towards the close of the Spanish era. La Electricista had built a central power plant on Calle San Sebastian (now Hidalgo Street ) in Quiapo, Manila. On January 17, 1895, its streetlights were turned on for the first time and by 1903, it had about 3,000 electric light customers. ===Founding of the Manila Electric Railroad and Light Company=== On October 20, 1902, during the American Colonial Period, the Second Philippine Commission began accepting bids to operate Manila's electric tramway, and by extension, providing electricity to the city and its suburbs. Detroit entrepreneur Charles M. Swift was the sole bidder and on March 24, 1903, was granted the original basic franchise of the Manila Electric Company. March 24 thus is marked annually as the company's anniversary. The Manila Electric Company acquired both La Electricista and the Compa√±√≠a de los Tranv√≠as de Filipinas, a firm that ran Manila's horse-drawn tramways which was founded in 1882. Construction on the electric tramway began that same year. In addition to acquiring La Electricista's Calle San Sebastian power plant, the company built its own steam generating plant on Isla Provisora (later becoming the Manila Thermal Power Plant), which powered the tram system and eventually also the electric service. By 1906, the Manila Electric Company's annual power output capacity was around eight million kWh. ===Manila Suburban Railways Company=== Swift was awarded another franchise in 1906 to operate a extension line from Paco to Fort McKinley and Pasig and founded the Manila Suburban Railway to operate this franchise. In 1919 this company merged with the Manila Electric Company. This extension was one of the most profitable of MERALCO's lines. By the 1920, MERALCO had a 170-strong fleet of streetcars, before switching over to buses later in that decade. The company operated 52-miles of trams until World War II. The equipment and tracks of the system was severely damaged during the war and had to be removed. ===Power generation and distribution=== By 1915, electricity generation and distribution became the main MERALCO's main income generator, overtaking its public transportation operations in terms of revenue. In 1919, it changed its official name to Manila Electric Company. By 1920, the company's power capacity had grown to 45 million kWh. In 1925, MERALCO was acquired by the utility holding company Associated Gas and Electric (AGECO, reorganized as General Public Utilities Corporation or GPU in 1946), which had begun a massive expansion throughout the United States and Canada. With AGECO's financial backing, MERALCO began acquiring a number of existing utility companies in the Philippines, enabling the company to expand beyond Manila. By 1930, MERALCO had completed construction of the Philippine's first hydroelectric power plant, the 23MW Botocan Hydro Station. At the time, this plant was one of the largest engineering projects in Asia and constituted the largest single private capital investment in the Philippines. The additional capacity allowed the company to begin hooking up customers throughout the metropolitan area. Meralco office (Malolos City Cultural and Heritage house.) To drive demand for more power, MERALCO also opened a retail store in order to sell electric home appliances. ===World War II=== During the Second World War, the Japanese occupying forces forcibly transferred all of MERALCO's assets and holdings to the Japanese-controlled Taiwan Power Company. By war's end, most of the former Meralco facilities had been destroyed. After the war, MERALCO's autobus franchise was sold to Halili Transport. ===The L√≥pez group=== Meralco (L√≥pez) Building along Ortigas Avenue, Pasig, Metro Manila. In 1962, Don Eugenio L√≥pez, Sr. acquired MERALCO and making it wholly Filipino-owned. During 1962-72, he increased MERALCO's power generating capacity by five times with the building of additional power stations in the Manila area with two more planned in Rizal Province. In 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos declared Martial Law and issued Presidential Decree ‚Ññ 40, which nationalized the country's electric generation and transmission. L√≥pez's eldest son, Eugenio, Jr. (\\"Geny\\"), was arrested in order to force the elder L√≥pez to turn over his businesses to President Marcos. Geny was charged for allegedly conspiring to assassinate President Marcos. With his son imprisoned, L√≥pez was forced to give up his holdings in several companies worth several hundred million dollars, but Geny was not released from prison. Ownership of MERALCO was placed under a shell company called the Meralco Foundation, Inc., controlled by Marcos associates (in particular, his brother-in-law Benjamin Romualdez), under the newly created state-run National Power Corporation (Napocor). By 1978, all of the Philippines' major power plants were owned and operated by Napocor, including the Metro Manila plants that MERALCO had built beforehand in the 1960s. State control for the company, however, began in 1975, given the company's rising debt and financial problems during the decade. By the end of the Martial Law period in 1981, MERALCO expanded even further into Cavite and western parts of Laguna, Rizal and Quezon provinces, as well as parts of southern Bulacan. State control of MERALCO lasted until the People Power Revolution in February 1986 toppled the Marcos dictatorship. President Corazon Aquino reverted company ownership to the L√≥pez Group, without them paying for the state-funded improvements done during Martial Law. She also enacted an executive order that allowed the company to directly compete with Napocor. On March 18, 1989, MERALCO unveiled its new corporate logo, which the company has been using up to the present. ===Entry of First Pacific and JG Summit groups=== Between 2009 and 2012, the L√≥pez Group would reduce its 33.4% holdings in MERALCO by selling most of its shares to the First Pacific Group. By 2012, the L√≥pez Group's holdings in MERALCO would be reduced to 3.95%. The First Pacific Group, through Beacon Electric Asset Holdings Inc. and Metro Pacific Investment Corporation, currently holds 45.46% share in MERALCO, followed by the JG Summit Group with 29.56%, for a combined 75.02% control of MERALCO. ==Controversies== ===2008 legislative investigation on high power rates=== Meralco is facing a Philippine legislative inquiry/investigation for alleged excessive pricing. The government has considered a plan to take over Meralco, to reduce electricity bills. Meralco and National Transmission Corporation (TransCo) blamed each other for the high power rates. Meralco also blames high power generation costs, high transmission costs and government taxes imposed on the electricity sector from power generation to distribution. Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) President Winston Garc√≠a, however, blamed Meralco's inefficiency, its \\"bloated bureaucracy\\" and its sourcing of power from independent power producers (IPPs) also owned by the L√≥pez Family, and the need to amend the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) of 2001. Oscar L√≥pez said that if the GSIS would buy the Meralco shares, they must buy in whole cash, while many businessmen also said that taking over Meralco is not the way to reduce electrical price, which depends on the national government and the President. The issue was also seen as a purposeful diversion from the then-ongoing ZTE NBN scandal and other government issues. A perceived lack of general understanding regarding the issue of system loss, inherent in the business of utilities prompted Meralco's former holding company, First Philippine Holdings, to issue advertisements explaining systems loss. ===Syndicated estafa and bribery case=== The Department of Justice (Philippines) filed syndicated (fraud) charges against Meralco in its August 22, 2008 31-page resolution, filed with the Pasig Regional Trial Court. The May 29 National Association of Electricity Consumers for Reform (Nasecore) complaint accused Meralco of \\"illegally declaring as income ‚Ç±889 million in consumers‚Äô money, which represents interest from meter and bill deposits consumers had been paying since 1995.\\" No bail was recommended for all the accused, 2006 officers of Meralco, to wit: Meralco chairman and CEO Manuel Lopez, executive vice president and chief financial officer Daniel Tagaza, first Vice-resident and treasurer Rafael Andrada, vice president and corporate auditor and compliance officer Helen De Guzman, vice president and assistant comptroller Antonio Valera, and senior assistant vice president and assistant treasurer Manolo Fernando; 2006 Meralco directors Arthur Defensor Jr., Gregory Domingo, Octavio Victor Espiritu, Christian Monsod, Federico Puno, Washington Sycip, Emilio Vicens, Francisco Viray and former Prime Minister Cesar Virata. Nasecore's complaint accusing Meralco of \\"illegally declaring as income 889 million pesos in consumers‚Äô money, which represents interest from meter and bill deposits consumers had been paying since 1995,\\" was immediately refuted by the accused company as the alleged ‚Ç±889 million only stemmed from a generally accepted accounting principle of reversing Meralco's earlier provision for meter deposit interests which, earlier set at 10% per annum was deemed too high and was set to the recommended 6%. Meralco also questioned how a syndicated estafa case can arise when it has already announced and committed that it will be refunding to customers who paid meter deposit principals plus interest months ahead of the ERC prescribed schedule and has allocated enough funds for the said refund. Meralco is also involved in the GSIS-Meralco bribery case. ===Dismissal of syndicated estafa case=== On October 6, 2008, the Pasig City Regional Trial Court Branch 71 dismissed the syndicated estafa case filed against the Meralco board of directors, for the prosecution failed to establish all the elements of syndicated estafa. Presiding Judge Franco Falcon, pointed out in the ruling that the board is not the kind described by the law as being formed to perpetrate an illegal act for the board of directors were elected by stockholders. The court explained, ‚ÄúTherefore, the accused can never be charged of taking part in the commission of syndicated estafa not only because they are not part of a syndicate as contemplated by law in PD 1689, but more so, because there was absolutely no estafa committed.‚Äù According to Philippine law, to constitute syndicated estafa, the subject money or property must be received by the offenders. The money represents the accrued interests on the bill and meter deposits, which were paid by Meralco customers, not directly to the board, but to the various Meralco business centers where the customers transacted. Meralco expressed elation over the dismissal.http://balita.ph/2008/10/15/meralco-exec-expresses-elation-for- dismissal-of-estafa-case-filed-by-doj/ == Service area == Meralco's franchise area. Meralco serves Metro Manila, where it is the sole electricity distributor, as well as some nearby provinces, like Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon. Bulacan, Cavite, and Rizal are solely served by Meralco, but on some provinces, it only serves some parts, like in Laguna, Batangas, and Quezon, where most or some areas are served by electric cooperatives. In Laguna and Quezon, most part of those provinces are served by the company, but other areas, mostly rural municipalities, are served by electric cooperatives. In Batangas, only Santo Tomas, the First Philippine Industrial Park and First Industrial Township SEZ both in Tanauan, Batangas City, San Pascual and parts of Laurel (Barangays of Niyugan and Dayap Itaas) and Calaca (parts of Barangay Cahil) which facing Tagaytay‚ÄìNasugbu Highway are served by Meralco, and the rest of the province are franchise areas of electric cooperatives.

The game spawned a series of follow up games which were released throughout the 1980s. The series sold around 125,000 copies between 1985 and 1990Acornelectron.co.uk; Repton on Acorn Electron World with Repton 2 selling 35,000 itself. The games have since been remade for several modern systems, including iRepton for the iPhone / iPod Touch in 2010;iRepton website Android Repton 1, Android Repton 2 and Android Repton 3 from 2016 to 2018; and Repton's Journeys in 2018.Superior Interactive website The author was inspired by a review of the recently released Boulder Dash, but had never played the game. Compared with Boulder Dash, Repton is a much more calm and organized playing experience with the emphasis on puzzle-solving as opposed to arcade- style improvisation. This remained true as more types of object were added in the sequels. ==Series overview== ===Repton=== In game shot of the final level, Screen L (BBC Micro) Repton, the titular protagonist, is moved around an underground maze in a quest to find all the diamonds (some are held in safes, their release being triggered by finding and collecting a key) within a time limit for each of several levels, while avoiding being trapped or killed by falling rocks and monsters hatched from eggs. The original Repton game was released in the summer of 1985 and has 12 levels, with passwords making it possible to jump directly to later levels. If passwords are employed, on completion of the final level the displayed message challenges the player to complete the game without using them. The new versions of Repton for the PC, iOS and Android introduce additional levels; and new Repton levels are also featured in Repton Spectacular, Repton's Mystic and Challenge (for Repton 1) and Repton's Journeys (for Repton 2). ===Repton 2=== The sequel to the game, Repton 2, released for Christmas 1985 (release date 14 November 1985 ) is much bigger. It introduces several new features: spirits (that follow walls and objects to their left and must be guided into cages, turning them into diamonds) and skulls, both of which are fatal to Repton on collision. There are also jigsaw puzzle pieces to collect, which eventually spell out the message \\"Repton 2 is ended\\". There are no levels as such in Repton 2: instead transporters move Repton between different screens which, subject to some restrictions, can be completed in any order desired. The entire game is in effect one very large level without passwords, meaning that it must be completed in one attempt. Finally, some screens also contain an exposed 'roof', where meteors (predictably fatal to Repton) fall from the sky. Repton's requirements in Repton 2 are challenging: Repton must not only collect all diamonds (including those held in safes and behind cages), but also collect all earth, kill all the monsters, collect all puzzle pieces and use all transporters. Once these substantial tasks have been accomplished, Repton must then negotiate the 'roof' of the entire width of the final screen, avoiding meteors falling from the sky in order to reach the starport and thus complete the game. This part is particularly tricky, since the meteors fall in a random fashion, making it difficult for the gamer to guide Repton to safety. This long list of requirements, coupled with the fact that the game must be completed in one attempt, is unique among the Repton series and makes Repton 2 by far the hardest Repton game to successfully complete. Unfortunately a bug in the original version of Repton 2 meant that the game contained one diamond fewer than the stipulated number needed to finish the game, so completion of this first version is impossible. When Repton 2 was re-written for the PC, it introduced a 'save game' feature making it considerably easier to complete. In addition, brand new scenarios were included, effectively new games. ===Repton 3=== Repton 3, released 5 November 1986, was developed by Matthew Atkinson at Superior's invitation since Tim Tyler wasn't interested in programming it‚Äîalthough he did design some of the levels for the new game. While the first two games had only taken a month each to program, Repton 3 took eight months. It reverts to the form of a series of time-limited, password-protected levels. A few new features were introduced: fungus (a substance that gradually spreads wherever it finds space and kills Repton on contact), time capsules (resetting the current level's time limit each time one is collected), crowns and a timebomb which must be defused to complete each level. The inclusion of the timebomb means that, as well as collecting all of the diamonds and crowns, the user has to plan their route so as to finish up at the timebomb at the end of the level. Repton 3 includes a map editor along with the game, so that data files can be created with new maps and graphics for the levels. Three themed sets of such files were released as continuations of Repton 3, with the titles Around the World in 40 Screens (1987), The Life of Repton (1987) and Repton Thru Time (1988). These three titles use a slightly modified game engine, in which the algorithm for deciding on the direction spirits first move at the start of a level is improved. They all come with the same game editor as Repton 3. ===Repton Infinity=== Repton Infinity was released in 1988, by which time the BBC Micro's popularity as a games platform was beginning to wane. It was developed by Dave Acton and Dave Lawrence (who wrote the user-submitted program section *INFO in Acorn User magazine). It supplements the map editor and graphics editor with a powerful game logic editor which made it possible to alter the way all game objects behaved using a purpose-designed language called Reptol. Four different example games are included to demonstrate its flexibility: * Repton 3 - Take 2, with a couple of small technical differences in gameplay from Repton 3; * Repton 4, with imaginative new objects including photocopiers and moving jewels; * Robbo, ‚Äúa crazy robot in a strange topsy- turvy world‚Äù, according to the game inlay; and * Trakker, a chaotic game in which a bulldozer-driving protagonist must destroy various monsters by pushing fruit at them, and all scores are multiples of 17. There was a long-running problem, infamous amongst owners of the B+, the updated BBC B with 64k, when the newly released Repton Infinity ran on the original BBC B but refused to load on the updated B+. A string of unsuccessful replacements were issued before one that was compatible with both was eventually released. ===EGO: Repton 4=== A game marketed as EGO: Repton 4, was released for the Acorn Archimedes in 1992. It was designed by Richard Hanson and programmed by Gary Partis. This was actually an Archimedes conversion of an earlier Amiga/Atari ST game called Personality Crisis with the character of Repton added in.Repton 4 - Ego, Gary Partis portfolio, Partis Computing (Retrieved 2011-12-04) The game bears little relation to the rest of the Repton series, particularly in that contrary to the spirit of the original it relies on \\"secret\\" traps and passages which can only be discovered by walking onto them. (The objects and objectives in all the previous Repton games are visible and there are no hidden secrets to be discovered, although in some advanced episodes - notably \\"OAP\\" in Life of Repton, \\"Oceans\\" in Around the World and \\"Future\\" in Repton Thru Time - some objects and enemies are invisible or appear very similar to desirable or innocuous objects.) ===Repton: The Lost Realms=== In 1988, teenage programmer Paras Sidapara submitted a game he called Repton 4 to Superior Software. As Superior were already working on Repton Infinity, it was not published, and was forgotten until 2008, when a copy was rediscovered. The game was re-programmed by Tom Walker and rechristened The Lost Realms, to avoid confusion with the Repton 4 game included in Repton Infinity. It was launched in November 2010 by Retro Software, with Superior's permission.Retro Software's Repton: The Lost Realms page The game is similar in style to Repton 3, retaining the structure of separate, password-protected levels and the map and graphics editors. New features include balloons, \\"absorbency\\" doors (which can be opened when an \\"absorbalene\\" pill is collected, but each pill only allows a certain number of doors to be opened) and ice crystals (which, when collected, freeze any monsters on the level). ==Music== The music for Repton is Black and White Rag, by George Botsford, which has been well known in Britain at least since its 1969 popularization as the theme tune to the long- running TV snooker programme Pot Black. The Scott Joplin intermezzo The Chrysanthemum is the music for Repton 2. The music for Repton 3 was composed specifically for the game by Paul Hughes and Peter Clarke. Repton Infinity features in-game music, on pressing the 'T' key, although it does not play at the same time as the sound effects during the game, and is turned off by default. It was composed especially for the game by David Acton. ==Repton ports, clones and derivatives== ===Ports=== The Repton games were closely associated with the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron but versions were released for other 8-bit computers. Superior Software had planned to launch Repton 3 with ports for the Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC (as shown in pre-release press advertisements). The Amstrad version was never released but the C64 port did arrive in 1987. Ports of the first 3 Repton games were later developed for the ZX Spectrum and Repton and Repton 2 were released together as Repton Mania in 1989 (published using the joint Superior/Alligata name). This was not a success and the Spectrum Repton 3 was not released. In 1989 a version of Repton 3 featuring all expansion packs was also released for the BBC Micro's replacement, the 32-bit Acorn Archimedes. Its programmer, John Wallace, also produced a slightly expanded version of Repton 2 for the Acorn Archimedes which was released on the 1993 Play It Again Sam 2 compilation (which also included Zarch, Master Break and Arcpinball). None of these ports achieved the sales of the BBC originals. In the late 1990s, Superior sub-licensed the games to ProAction who released a number of RISC OS ports for the Acorn Archimedes and RiscPC. John Wallace created new ports of Repton, Repton 2 and Repton 3. ProAction also released Desktop Repton which includes the 3 games (including the expansion games for Repton 3). These games were built from scratch by Darren Salt, and developed to run in a multi tasking window on the desktop. There was also Desktop Repton Plus, with new PC graphics and extra levels included for Repton 1.Drobe.co.uk Review There have been numerous ports of Repton 3, including a free version for Linux.KRepton Under the name Superior Interactive,SuperiorInteractive.com the original publishers re-released versions of Repton 1 (2003), Repton 2 (2004) and Repton 3, including all of the expansion games (2005), for Microsoft Windows. They also released a large pack of new levels for all three modern Repton ports named Repton Spectacular in 2010. Also in 2010, iRepton was released for the Apple iPhone / iPod Touch (ESZ Consulting / Superior Interactive). This has retro and enhanced graphics and sounds and new screens. On 7 October 2014 iRepton 3 was released for the iPad and iPhone, featuring the same level of graphic enhancements as iRepton 1, which also had an overhaul at the same time. ===Clones=== A deliberate clone called Ripton, extremely faithful apart from different level design and several humorous digs at the original game, was written by Kenton Price and submitted to A&B; Computing but the magazine never dared to publish it. It is, however, now available at BBC software Internet sites. There was also a PD clone for the ZX Spectrum called Riptoff, which included a level editor. It was developed by Rick O'Neill and Craig Hunter, and was released exclusively on a 1991 Your Sinclair covertape.Riptoff at World of Spectrum ===Derivatives=== Because of Repton's ubiquity on the platform it became impossible not to compare to it any later commercial scrolling-map game for the BBC/Electron. Later puzzle-based games such as Bonecruncher and Clogger might justifiably be said to be derivative of Repton, but this perception also encompassed arcade adventure/role-playing games presented in the four-way- scrolling format (the notable ones being Ravenskull and Pipeline) despite their different style involving unique objects and encounters and unexpected traps. A non-scrolling 5-level type-in called Pitfall Pete written by Jonathan Temple was also described as \\"'Repton' style\\" when it was published by BEEBUG in 1986 and expanded to 15 levels in 1991. Repton's original author has written a public domainRockz SourceForge page (linked to from Rockz site) says License: Public Domain Java rocks-and-diamonds game, Rockz,Rockz which features elements in the vein of both Repton 2 and Boulder Dash. A game called Mole Miner was released for Android devices in 2009 by Little Fluffy Toys Ltd. The game was designed by Kenton Price, who also wrote Ripton (see above). It builds on the rocks-and-diamonds genre typified by Repton, extending it with features such as explosives, sliding ice and wraparound, and includes a community level designer. Mole Miner contains 60 levels created by Michael S. Repton, the author of many levels in later Repton series games. ==References== ==External links== * Superior Interactive * Repton author's personal website * Repton Resource Page Category:1985 video games Category:Rocks-and-diamonds games Category:Superior Software games Category:Acorn Archimedes games Category:BBC Micro and Acorn Electron games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:IOS games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Windows games Category:ZX Spectrum games Category:Linux games ","title":"Repton (video game)"},{"id":"1270939","text":"Wac≈Çaw Rzewuski wearing a golden-finished kontusz sash Kontusz scarf Kontush belt (\\"kontusz sash\\" or the Slutsk sash; ) was a cloth sash used for girding a kontusz (a robe-like garment). It was one of the most distinctive items of male dress of Polish and Lithuanian nobility (szlachta) from about 17th through the 19th centuries. In an earlier periods, sometimes narrower sashes of fine cloth or silk net were worn, but the wide kontusz sash is specific to the later period. ==Origins== Like the rest of Polish national dress, the kontusz sash was of eastern origin. It comprised a 3- to 4.5-meter-long strip of fabric covered with varied designs, around 40 cm wide. Luxurious sashes were made with silk and gold. Depending on the sash's width, it might be folded a number of ways so as to reveal various designs on various occasions, the most ornate sashes were considered to have four sides. Initially such sashes were imported from Persia and Turkey. In the 17th century several sash manufactories were founded at places all over Rzeczpospolita, such as Koby≈Çka, Lipk√≥w, Hrodna, Krak√≥w and Gda≈Ñsk. The largest and most notable manufacturies, however, were at Slutsk. Sashes produced there were considered the most desirable and were also the most expensive. Because of the popularity of the pas kontuszowy produced there, it was sometimes called pas s≈Çucki (Slutsk sash), regardless of the actual place of origin. Slutsk (city of Slutsk) sashes had two different color patterns on each side. A modern Polish poet and a singer, Jacek Kaczmarski, has sung about those sashes in one of his ballads, Z pasa s≈Çuckiego po≈ºytek (The uses of a Slutsk sash). Slutsk sash is declared to be a cultural heritage of Belarus.http://sights.gov.by/ru/main.aspx?guid=-3763 Kontush Sash an Attribute of a Nobleman. THe Kontush Sash (belt) has an oriental provenance rooted in Persian and Turkish tradition. Continual contact between the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and Persia and even more with Turkey developed vast trade roots and raised popular interest in oriental art and decoration all over ‚ÄúEastern‚Äù Europe. The Ideology of Sarmathism created in the XVIc a wide super-ethnos embracing many Central European nations. The Kontush Belt was a visual manifestation of Sarmathian identity and was widely popular in Lithuania and Belarus, in Poland, Ukraine, Hungary, Saxony, Moldavia, Besarabia and some parts of Russia. Kontush belts were worn by the Nobility, Cossack elders and high municipal officials. The time of prosperity during the period of XVI ‚Äì XVIIIc created surplus financial resources often channeled into culture, art and decoration. Polish Armenian merchants imported objects of luxury: oriental carpets, weapons decorated with gold and stones, expensive fabrics. Kontush belts especially emphasized the status of the bearer and were unusually expensive. At a certain moment the demand for Kontush belts became so large that it was necessary to open local manufacturing on the territory of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. The workshops producing Kontush Belts in Slutsk, Grodno, Lvov, Vilnius, Buchach, Kobylki, Krak√≥w, Gdansk, Lipkow were opened mostly by Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Armenians. The belts that were made there still had a lot of oriental ornamentation, but had their own distinct character ‚Äì different from the belts formerly imported from Persia and Turkey. There was a practical aspect to the belt as well. Folded in half and wrapped around the body, it served as a pocket for money and documents. Most belts are about 30 cm wide and around 3,5m long. As a result of the weaving technique ‚Äì one side of the belt was a negative of the other. This way it was possible for the belt to have two different color schemes (so called two-sided belt). Further division of the belt allowed for four color compositions (four-sided belt). The price of the belt depended on the materials used (sometimes they added silver and gold thread). The complexity of the design raised the price even more since it required more complicated manufacturing machinery, higher qualifications of the craftsmen and a longer production cycle. The four-sided belts were the most expensive. They were meant to be worn on different occasions: bright side ‚Äì for weddings, dark side for funerals, green side for the green kontush etc. Very often the belt served as a table decoration ‚Äì it was placed on the center atop the table cloth. ==See also== * ≈ºupan ==References== ==External links== ;Pictures *https://web.archive.org/web/20060306184828/http://www.mnw.art.pl/Zbiory/stefan%20for%20web/pas%20kontuszowy.html *https://web.archive.org/web/20070311022045/http://www.muzeum.slupsk.pl/grafika/galeria/duze/s751.jpg *http://img.interia.pl/encyklopedia/nimg/kontusz15.jpg *https://web.archive.org/web/20080512064601/http://monika.univ.gda.pl/~literat/kitowic/pas.htm *https://web.archive.org/web/20070310214025/http://www.nova- polska.pl/fr/site/program/wy_in_splendor_poloniae/fo_dijon_pas_kontuszowy.jpg ==Further reading== *Maria Taszycka, Polskie pasy kontuszowe, Wyd.

Such a player is said to be cup-tied, i.e. tied to their original club for the duration of the cup tournament. They become eligible for their new club in the following season. The rule is intended to prevent teams which progress in the competition buying talented players from teams which have already been eliminated, in an attempt to increase their chances of winning. It also discourages players whose chief priority is winning a trophy from requesting a transfer once their team has been eliminated from the competition. Since the introduction of transfer windows, which the cup-tied rule pre-dates, some have criticised the rule as outdated. Nevertheless, it remains widely applied. Almost all cup competitions worldwide operate a cup-tied rule, but leagues do not (as leagues do not eliminate teams during the season). Cup-tied players are only prevented from playing in that specific competition, so for example a player who is cup-tied in the FA Cup may still be eligible to play in the League Cup (or vice versa). UEFA competitions are an exception: because teams can switch between the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League Despite the names, both of these are cup competitions. They each incorporate a mini- league stage, but all other rounds are a knock-out tournament. Both competitions operate by progressively eliminating teams, which is the underlying cause of the cup-tied rule. during the season, UEFA has a more complex system for determining whether a player is cup-tied in one or both of those competitions. ==The cup-tied rule== In almost all domestic and international club cup competitions, any player who makes an appearance for a club at any stage of the competition is \\"tied\\" to that club for all future matches during that season in the same competition. This prevents a wealthy team still in the competition from gaining an unfair advantage by signing talented players from clubs that may have lost out in earlier rounds, in an attempt to increase their cup chances. The rule applies to individual cup competitions, such that a player who plays in the English FA Cup, but not the Football League Cup, for example, is cup-tied only in the former competition. If the player signs for a new club in the same season, he is thus eligible for the Football League Cup, but not the FA Cup. Breaching the cup-tied rule can result in a result being declared invalid, with serious consequences for the offending club. Governing bodies usually reserve the right to waive the rule, but do so only in exceptional circumstances. ===UEFA competitions=== UEFA operates European club football competitions, primarily the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. UEFA's regulations state that, with a few exceptions, players who play in any European club competition are subsequently cup-tied with respect to all European football for the remainder of the season. On 27 March 2018, UEFA announced that it would phase out the cup-tied rule for the Champions League and Europa League, starting in the 2018-2019 season.http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2546984.html#/ The main current exception is the UEFA Super Cup, contested by the winners of the previous seasons' Champions League and Europa League. As this is effectively a prestige friendly with only one round, the cup-tied rule is seen as unnecessary. Representing a club in this fixture does not affect a player's eligibility in other UEFA competitions. Similarly, cup-tying did not apply to matches in the now-defunct pre-season UEFA Intertoto Cup, up to the semi-final round. A further exemption applies: one player per club who would normally be cup-tied can be registered and eligible to play, so long as his previous club did not field him in the same competition. This means that players can represent two clubs in the Europa League and Champions League, but only a maximum of one player per club. However, if the first club switches into the same competition (e.g. transfers from the Champions League to the Europa League through finishing third in the group stage), the transferred player becomes ineligible. This can lead to some complex situations. ===Criticism=== The cup-tied rule comes in for criticism from various fans and media pundits, particularly when a high profile player is ineligible for significant matches. Some argue that the rule is antiquated and that since the introduction of transfer windows, clubs cannot buy players solely for cup matches, but will only do so for the league (in which there is no cup-tie rule). ==Examples== In the 2008 FA Cup Final against Cardiff City, and in previous rounds, former Portsmouth player Jermain Defoe was cup-tied and was unable to play. Portsmouth won the cup final . There were similar cases with Earl Barrett's transfer to 1995 FA Cup winners Everton from Aston Villa, while beaten finalists Manchester United were unable to select Andy Cole, as he had played for Newcastle United in the third round a few days before his transfer. In 2006, Robbie Fowler was cup-tied for the victorious Liverpool team after his mid-season return to Anfield from Manchester City. In February 1993, Arsenal re-signed defender Martin Keown from Everton, nearly seven years after he had left the club. They went on to win the League Cup and FA Cup that season, but Keown was unable to play in either of the finals, having already turned out for Everton earlier in both competitions. In January 1991, defender Viv Anderson was sold to Sheffield Wednesday by Manchester United, and three months later the two teams met in the League Cup final. Sheffield Wednesday won the game, but Anderson had been unable to play, for he had appeared - and scored - in a second-round tie for Manchester United six months earlier. In another instance, Ronaldo bought out his contract with Real Madrid to move to Milan; he was cup-tied to Madrid in the Champions League. Milan went on to win the tournament, but Ronaldo was not allowed to play in any of their games. Andrei Arshavin was cup-tied in the Champions League after moving to Arsenal during the January 2009 transfer window, having earlier represented Zenit St. Petersburg in the group stage of that competition. In another example concerning Liverpool, this time in the UEFA Champions League, Fernando Morientes was cup-tied for their games leading up to and including the final of the competition in 2005, which Liverpool won. This was due to Morientes playing in the group stage of the competition with Real Madrid. ===Enforcement=== In the 1999‚Äì2000 Football League Cup, West Ham United were ordered to replay a match they had won against Aston Villa, after bringing on as a substitute Emmanuel Omoyinmi, who had appeared for Gillingham in an earlier round. West Ham lost the replay. A notable example of non-enforcement was in the 1957‚Äì58 FA Cup. Stan Crowther and Ernie Taylor would normally have been cup-tied and thus ineligible to play for Manchester United. However, they were granted an exemption and allowed to play because the club had suffered the Munich air disaster earlier that season. In that air crash, eight United players died and two others were so seriously injured that they never played again, while five others had still not fully recovered from their injuries when the match was played. The Football Association therefore waived the cup- tied rule. ===UEFA=== UEFA's rules regarding their linked competitions and potential exceptions can lead to some complex situations. This was the case with Alan Hutton, who could not play in Europe for Tottenham Hotspur following his former club Rangers' coming third in their Champions League group, which meant they switched to the Europa League for the remainder of the competition. Had Rangers come 1st, 2nd or 4th in their group, Hutton would have been able to play for Tottenham.https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/spurs-9m-hutton-cant- play-in-uefa-cup-and-its-because-rangers-are-losers-6675054.html Another interesting case came in 2009, when Real Madrid purchased Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Lassana Diarra ‚Äì both of whom had already played European football during the season for Ajax and Portsmouth, respectively ‚Äì during the winter transfer window. Because of UEFA rules, Madrid could only pick one of these players, and ended up selecting Diarra for their European roster. Despite the rule, Real Madrid attempted to circumvent the restriction, to no avail. ==Manipulation== Football managers can sometimes decide whether to field a player in order to deliberately cup-tie (or avoid cup-tying) the player. This can be used to manipulate their value on the transfer market for the remainder of the season, because it affects whether any potential new club can field them in the cup. There are two major motivations for deciding to cup-tie a player or not: ===To increase a player's value=== A team that wishes to transfer a player may deliberately choose not to field them in cup competitions to ensure they are not cup-tied, increasing the player's usefulness to a club that is still involved in the same competition. Two examples of this were in the 2004‚Äì05 and 2005‚Äì06 seasons, both of which involved English Premier League club Liverpool. In 2004‚Äì05, Liverpool's Michael Owen sat out of his club's Champions League games so that other top European teams would be able to sign him; he subsequently transferred to Real Madrid. Ironically, Madrid were knocked out by Juventus in the round of 16, who were in turn knocked out by Liverpool on their way to winning the Champions League that season. The following season, Liverpool manager Rafael Ben√≠tez again decided to keep one of his players, Milan Baro≈°, out of Liverpool's squad for their 2005‚Äì06 UEFA Champions League ties in order to retain his value to clubs interested in purchasing the Czech striker's services. This time the manipulation was less successful: Baro≈° eventually moved to Aston Villa, a club who were not involved in the Champions League and therefore gained no benefit from Baro≈° not being cup-tied. ===To discourage transfer interest=== Similarly, although less often, a team may deliberately cup-tie a player to discourage attempts (by the player or interested clubs) to transfer them during that season. This only applies if the player would not otherwise make it onto the team ‚Äì it can be achieved by bringing them on as a substitute towards the end of a game. However, this is of limited use for international transfers, where cup-tying only applies if both teams involved in the transfer are competing in the same continental competition (such as the UEFA Champions League or UEFA Europa League). ==Notes and references== ===Notes=== ===References=== Category:Association football terminology ","title":"Cup-tied"},{"id":"1270962","text":"Michael Sprott (born 16 January 1975) is a British professional boxer. He held the British and Commonwealth heavyweight titles in 2004 and the EBU European Union heavyweight title twice between 2005 and 2007. He was the winner of the 14th Prizefighter series. ==Career== After a quiet amateur career, Sprott turned pro in November 1996 under the old Frank Bruno trainer, Terry Lawless. He won 11 fights, including a points win over veteran Michael Murray before taking on Harry Senior in September 1998 for the Southern Area Heavyweight title. Senior, a respected sparring partner, had recently dedicated himself to being a full-time professional, and took Sprott out in 6 rounds with body shots. Sprott came back with 3 wins before falling apart in 3 rounds versus British contender Wayne Llewelyn in October 2000. Seemingly relegated to journeyman status, In February 2001 in London, Sprott scored an upset when he outpointed the once-beaten German Timo Hoffmann, who had lost only to Vitali Klitschko. He travelled to Germany for the rematch, controversially outpointed by Hoffmann in a result that was jeered loudly by the German crowd. In November 2001, he travelled to South Africa to face hard hitting fringe contender Corrie Sanders. In a brief and entertaining fight, Sprott rocked the southpaw before being decked himself, and suffering a controversial stoppage by the referee, with even the South African commentators deploring the stoppage. In February 2002, Keith Long pulled out from a British and Commonwealth title fight with Danny Williams, and Sprott flew in from a holiday in Jamaica on only a few days notice. After a few rounds he ran out of gas and was stopped in the seventh round, but showed he could compete at national level. It was around this time that Sprott brought in trainer John Bloomfield, who spent six years with Frank Bruno. After this challenge, Sprott went on a successful run of form, winning 8 fights, including knockouts of Pele Reid (KO7), ex-British champ Michael Holden (KO4), Mark Potter (KO3), and Colin Kenna (KO1), setting up a rematch with Williams. In September 2003, Sprott qualified for another shot at Williams and his titles, but after a far more competitive fight, Sprott was the victim of several low blows. When he complained to the referee he was controversially knocked out by a Williams left hook. In January 2004, Sprott narrowly outpointed Williams in their third and final fight (115-114), lifting the British and Commonwealth titles. A few months later Williams would knockout Mike Tyson, however Sprott would lose his titles in his first defense, matched with fast undefeated Matt Skelton (12-0), Sprott was mauled and stopped in the 12th. His last fight of 2004 was a win against Czech heavyweight champ Robert ≈†ulgan in Bethnal Green. In 2005, Sprott would take the first of many trips abroad fighting top prospects, usually at short notice. In April he beat the German amateur star Cengiz Koc, but in October was beaten on points by Olympian Paolo Vidoz in a European title fight, both fights in Germany. In December he fought future European champ Vladimir Virchis in Austria, but was once-again the victim of a controversial decision loss. In February 2006, he outboxed veteran Antoine Palatis in Scotland, but in a WBA Eliminator in July was hammered in 8 one- sided rounds by undefeated Ruslan Chagaev. Despite the loss he went back to Germany and beat a third German prospect when he upset undefeated southpaw Rene Dettweiller in November. During his travels in Germany, Sprott had picked up the second-tier European Heavyweight title, the \\"EU\\" title, which he defended against 2000 Olympic Gold medallist Audley Harrison in London, February 2007. Harrison had demolished Danny Williams in his last fight and was on course to face Matt Skelton in a world title eliminator. A 9/2 underdog with most bookies, Sprott came off the floor in the 1st round to score a rare stoppage win by knocking Harrison clean out in the 3rd with a left hook; and seemingly ending his career. On 14 July 2007, Sprott lost to Matt Skelton in a 12-round contest. The fight was of a very poor standard with Skelton winning on points. On 31 May 2008, Sprott travelled to Germany to face hot prospect, and the WBA's #4 ranked contender Taras Bidenko. Sprott was outpointed in a 10-round unanimous decision, with 2 judges scoring the bout 97-93, and the other seeing it 97-94. On 14 March 2009, Sprott fought former WBO heavyweight champion Lamon Brewster and lost a unanimous decision. He fought Alexander Ustinov on 20 June 2009, but lost by unanimous decision after ten rounds. However he beat German Werner Kreiskott by round 1 TKO in March 2010 and this earned him a shot at the vacant European Boxing Union title against old foe Audley Harrison at Alexandra Palace in April 2010. Sprott was leading the bout on all three scorecards before Harrison knocked out Sprott with seconds remaining of round 12. On 9 October 2010, a 35-year-old Sprott competed in Sky's 'PrizeFighter' series (Heavyweights), reaching the final where he fought Matt Skelton. It was third time lucky for Sprott, who had lost his previous 2 contests with the 43-year-old Skelton, Winning on a split decision (29-28 Skelton 29-28 sprott 29-28 sprott) after the 3 round contest and winning ¬£32,000 in 'winner take all' prize money. In September 2011, he suffered a third defeat in a European heavyweight title bout when he lost a unanimous points decision to Ukrainian Alexander Dimitrenko in Hamburg. ==Outside the ring== Michael Sprott has a son called Darnell born around 2001. Darnell's name is stitched on the shorts Sprott wears for his professional contests. In recent contests Sprott's shorts have also displayed the name of his late sister Ginette, who took her own life in September 2009 after a long battle with depression.  He lists his hobbies as weights, travelling and meeting new people. Outside boxing, Sprott enjoys rugby and the Wimbledon Championships. His favourite football teams are Reading FC and Arsenal F.C.. ==Professional boxing record== -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"8\\"42 Wins (17 knockouts), 29 Losses (18 knockouts), 0 Draws -

He made a fortune selling his clocks, and his business grew quickly. However, his company failed in 1856, and he died in poverty. ==Early life== He was born in Canaan in 1793; Chauncey Jerome was the son of a blacksmith and nail-maker. ==Career== Jerome began his career in Plymouth, making dials for long-case clocks. Jerome learned what he could about clocks, particularly clock cases, and then went to New Jersey to make seven-foot cases for clocks. In 1816 he went to work for Eli Terry making \\"Patent Shelf Clocks,\\" learning how to make previously handmade cases using machinery. Deciding to go into business for himself, Jerome began to make cases, trading them to Terry for wooden movements. In 1822 Jerome moved his business to Bristol, opening a small shop with his brother Noble, producing 30-hour and eight-day wooden clocks. The company installed the first circular saw ever seen in Bristol. By 1837 Jerome's company was selling more clocks than any of his competitors. A one-day wood-cased clock, which sold for six dollars, had helped put the company on the map. A year later his company was selling that same clock for four dollars. The company sold one line of clocks at a wholesale price of 75 Million Dollars. By 1841 the company was showing an annual profit of a whopping $35,000, primarily from the sale of brass movements. A 19th-century Chauncey Jerome clock In 1842 Jerome moved his clock-case manufacturing operation to St. John Street in New Haven. Three years later, following a fire that destroyed the Bristol plant, Jerome relocated the entire operation to the Elm City. Enlarging the plant, the company soon became the largest industrial employer in the city, producing 150,000 clocks annually. Because of his discovery of a method of stamping rather than using casting gears, Jerome was producing the lowest-priced clocks in the world at the time. In 1850 Jerome formed the Jerome Manufacturing Co. as a joint-stock company with Benedict & Burnham, brass manufacturers of Waterbury. In 1853 the company became known as the New Haven Clock Co., producing 444,000 clocks and timepieces annually. Jerome's future should have been secure but in 1855 he bought out a failed Bridgeport clock company controlled by P.T. Barnum, which wiped him out financially, leaving the Jerome Manufacturing Co. bankrupt. Jerome never recovered from the loss. By his own admission, he was a better inventor than businessman. Traveling from town to town, Jerome took jobs where he could, often working for clock companies that had learned the business of clock making using Jerome's inventions. Returning to New Haven near the end of his life, he died, penniless, in 1868 at age 74. Nevertheless, Jerome had made a historic contribution to his industry when he substituted brass works for wooden works, said to be \\"the greatest and most far-reaching contribution to the clock industry.\\" He made, and lost, a fortune selling his clocks and was perhaps the most influential and creative person associated with the American clock business during the mid-19th century. In addition he served as a legislator in 1834, a Presidential elector in 1852 and mayor of New Haven from 1854 to 1855. Always humble, of his own life he wrote: \\"The ticking of a clock is music to me, and although many of my experiences as a business man have been trying and bitter, I have satisfaction of knowing that I have lived the life of an honest man, and have been of some use to my fellow men.\\" ==Early life== Jerome was born in Canaan CT, and later moved to Plymouth Ct, where his father started a blacksmith shop. Jerome was a young boy when his father died, on October 5, 1804, and was forced to work in apprenticeship with salesmen. In one event, when walking around Bethlehem CT, to get to Torrington with his master, he noted how close he was to his mother in Plymouth, that night he made a run for it, running about twenty miles through woods, properties, farms, and in one case chased by dogs for a few miles, finally met his mother the next morning in Plymouth, the moment he contacted her, he realized it was morning and had to leave. He was victim of war at New Haven Fort, and when finished, he moved back to Plymouth to start an apprenticeship with Eli Terry. ==Brave ideas, and the Journey to England== Jerome started manufacturing in Bristol off of West Street. He took note of all of the men who laughed at \\"Mr. Terry\\" for Terry's foolish ideas of selling a clock for a minor $14. Jerome came up with the idea of a rectangular shelf clock, brass in method, and sell- able for $1, the OG clock. Jerome sent his son, and a peddler who was a great friend of Jerome to England to sell his one dollar OG clocks. Several months went by, as store owners in England refused to buy Jerome's clocks. The shop owners understood that Eli Terry's pillar and scroll clocks were \\"garbage\\" and never worked (because wooden gears warp over seas, causing poor time keepers). Finally Jerome's son got a man to buy a clock for one dollar, and put it on a shelf- the next day, an English man walked in and saw it was still working, and proudly purchased the clock, this started a chain reaction, and the shop owner purchased 100 more clocks on the spot. Jerome's friend who supervised his son fell ill and died in England, followed by his son three months later. ==References* The History of Chauncey Jerome, clockmaker * [Chauncey Jerome: https://archive.org/stream/historyofamerica00jero#page/n5/mode/2up History of the American Clock Business for the Past Sixty Years, and Life of Chauncey Jerome].

There is boat transportation to Dog Island. ==Airport== Dog Island Airport is an untowered, private use airport located by the Eastern bay of Dog Island. The airport opened in 1930. ==Origin== The island and its two small neighbors were discovered by the French in 1536 and named Dog Island, Isle des Chiens, because, according to different legends: 1) wild dogs were found on them; 2) the island resembles a crouched dog, or 3) the early ships put their common sailors ‚Äî known as dogs ‚Äî on the island before docking on the mainland so they could not jump ship. Later, the two neighbors were renamed: St. Vincent, which is a Federal wildlife refuge, and St. George, which has a causeway and an airport (FA43), has developed into a seaside vacation community with shops and beach rentals. After World War II, Jeff Lewis, a Florida businessman, saw its potential as a vacation area and paid $12,000 for the island. Native Americans used Dog Island as a fishing camp, and the 1985 hurricanes uncovered pot shards on the west end of the island. A Florida Shore Where Solitude Rules ==History== Dog Island shows evidence of human presence dating back over 8,000 years. The island also has a rich maritime history. The discovery of a 9th-century canoe is a testament to prehistoric mariners on the island. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the barrier islands became a haven of piracy and smuggling. ===18th century=== On February 16, 1766, Le Tigre, a French merchant brigantine, was en route to New Orleans and wrecked east of Dog Island in a great storm. A survivor, Monsieur Pierre Viaud, chronicled the experience in the best-selling narrative The Shipwreck and Adventures of Monsieur Pierre Viaud, published 1769 (and translated to English in 1771).The Shipwreck and Adventures of Monsieur Pierre Viaud In 1799, the Royal Navy purchased HMS Fox, a 14-gun British schooner, only to see it wreck later that year between Dog and St. George Islands. ===19th century=== As part of the United States, economic shipping greatly increased as St. Marks, St. Joseph, and Apalachicola became major ports on the Gulf Coast. Both sail and steam ships traveled to Dog Island to exploit its resources of lumber and naval stores, such as turpentine and pitch products. In 1838, Dog Island Light was built on the western tip of the island. During the Civil War, Dog Island was used by the Union Navy as a base for staging the blockade of Apalachicola. In 1899, the 2nd hurricane of the season struck the area, almost destroying the town of Carrabelle, leaving just nine homes. Roughly 6 miles inland at McIntyre, only two mill boilers were left. The summer resort of Lanark Inn was said to be \\"blown into the Gulf\\". The Carrabelle, Tallahassee and Georgia Railroad was destroyed for a distance of 30 miles, and a locomotive was displaced some 100 yards off the track.NY Times article archives Fifteen ships were destroyed, 12 loaded with lumber.PhD dissertation, Christopher Horrell, Florida State University, Chapter 5 Meide et al. 2000 Dog Island Shipwreck Survey 1999: Report of Historical and Archaeological Investigations, FSU Program in Underwater Archaeology Research Reports No. 4 (can be viewed or downloaded as 252 pages in pdf format on Academia.edu) They were: *American ships **, a schooner, under the command of Capt.

Four separate camps comprised the complex: three for regimental combat teams, and the fourth for the headquarters and support facilities. Dog Island was used for amphibious landings and airdrops. A passenger ferry ran from Carrabelle to Dog Island in the later 20th century. An archaeological research project, the Dog Island Shipwreck Survey, was initiated in 1999 by Florida State University researcher Chuck Meide to systematically search the waters off Dog Island, using acoustic and electromagnetic devices, to discover historic shipwrecks. Project archaeologists conducted excavations on the wreck of the 1899 Norwegian lumber ship Vale mentioned above, and also located a number of other submerged archaeological sites, including the ruins of the Dog Island Lighthouse, using sonar and magnetometer. ===21st century=== After Hurricane Michael of 2018, the 1899 shipwrecks re-emerged from the sand. == References == == External links == *Topographic map of Dog Island *Florida State Univ.

Glen Williams is noted for its visual artists, artist's studios, heritage buildings, a restaurant and bakery, a community centre (Town Hall), parks, churches and homes. The Credit River flow through the hamlet, providing a habitat for animals. ==History== In the fall of 1824, a grant of in the township of Esquesing was made by the crown to John Butler Muirhead. The land was eventually sold for ¬£100 to Benajah Williams. The Credit River was used to run saw and flour mills. By 1833, Williams had purchased another 200-acre parcel, giving him the that became Glen Williams. The Williams' Mill is where the first industry stood, a saw mill built by Benajah and sons Joel and Charles in 1825. Charles Williams became the leading figure in the community, and by the mid-1860s, he was proprietor of the flour, woollen, and saw mills, as well as a justice of the peace in Williamsburg. Williams Mill Arts Centre A second sawmill in the village was operated from 1856 by Joseph Tweddle, and a third saw mill was on \\"the Mountain,\\" run by steam, erected by Charles Symons of Acton, and leased to and run by Cooper and sons of the Glen. It burned down in the summer of 1876. Members of the Williams family worked as a blacksmith, cabinetmaker, leather tanner, and general store proprietor. Jacob Williams opened a woolen mill in 1839. ===Glen Woollen Mills=== A woollen mill, built of wood, was erected in 1839 by Jacob Williams. When he died in 1853, his elder brother Charles took over the property. The building also housed Brown's Pump Factory and Bradshaw's Comb Factory. The building was destroyed by fire in 1867. In 1877, Charles Williams bought the bobbin factory. After a fire in 1867, Charles Williams erected a new stone mill. The building was finished, but fire struck again in 1875. Charles' son Benajah became the proprietor, and rebuilt it two-and-a-half stories and powered by a 40-horsepower Leffel water wheel. The building was heated by steam and equipped with a system of waterworks for quenching fires. It employmed 50 to 60 people directly, and used of Canadian wool daily. The mill bought the latest cards, spinning machines, twisters, and Knitting machines built by Davis and Furber in Northampton, Massachusetts. The rebuilding and re- equipping cost $32,000. By 1877, Ben Williams had failed and run away. His debts had risen to the cost of rebuilding the factory and more, and in January 1878, the Toronto Globe advertised the sale of the mill. His brother Joseph purchased the mill. Glen Woollen Mills during spring flood, 1910 In 1894, the mill was operated by the Sykes and Ainley Manufacturing Company. The E. Y. Barraclough house on Mountain Street overlooking the Glen Woollen Mills. The Glen Woollen Mills Company was organized in 1907 to carry on the business. The looms wove grey blankets, robe linings, fancy buggy rugs, wool horse blankets, kersey, collar check, carpet and knitting yarns. About this same time, the Melrose Knitting Company was set up as a subsidiary. It produced about 45,000 dozen pairs of men's wool socks and lumberman's socks a year. Sixty to seventy people worked there, and a hundred could have been employed if they could be found. Because of the shortage of labour, twelve English automatic machines were installed; and with the care of two boys, they knit 60 dozen pairs of socks a day. The mill was run by water power, though a 100-horsepower boiler and engine used for heating and drying could provide emergency power; and their own dynamo produced the electricity to run delicate machinery and lighting.\\" After Barraclough's death, the mill passed through a number of operators, and was destroyed by fire in 1954. ===Beaumont Knitting Mill=== Beaumont Knitting Mill workers - 1893 An Irish millwright named James Bradley bought the old Tweedle Saw Mill upstream from Benjah, along with five carding machines and the largest picker. The Dominion Glove Works also producing a 200 dozen pairs of socks daily, which would sell at 25 to 50 cents a pair, and about 40 dozen pairs of mitts and gloves, selling at 50 cents to a dollar. The mill employed 80 to 100 workers. In 1982, the mill was sold and closed. Beaumont Mill Antiques and Collectibles is now located there. ===Heritage buildings=== Glen Williams Town Hall Reeve and Clarke Books * The original Williams saw mill, now the Williams Mill Arts Centre. * Glen Williams Town Hall, first used for a board meeting in 1870, has been used by numerous societies, churches, and political meetings, and acted as a polling station for elections. In the 20th century, the hall provided the stage for dances and Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery, who staged many works there with her Union Dramatic Players. It also served briefly as a school. * Laidlaw House, the Frazier Shop, the Williams Chair Factory (Williams-Holt House), and the Beaumont Knitting Mill. * Reeve and Clarke Fine and Rare Books, an antiquarian book business that sells second-hand books. The store is located in the storefront of Laidlaw House and the Frazier Shop in which Timothy Eaton first worked in retail. Beyond the designated heritage properties, more that 35 other properties in Glen Williams are listed in the Town of Halton Hills Heritage Register. ==Arts and culture== Famed Group of Seven artist A. J. Casson often spent summers in Glen Williams, which he used as a base to paint local scenes. The village itself is the subject of Casson's 1938 oil on canvas, \\"Street in Glen Williams\\", a leafy, autumnal portrait of a quiet road in the hamlet, which sold at auction in Toronto on June 1, 2010 for a record $542,800, including buyer's premium, the highest such valuation ever accorded a Casson canvas. Casson, who joined the Group of Seven in 1926, \\"recorded small towns in every season,\\" Canadian art critic and historian Paul Duval wrote in 1980, \\"and Street in Glen Williams is unquestionably his key autumn portrayal.\\" Other paintings of Casson's time in and around Glen Williams include \\"Country Road - Glen Williams\\", \\"Village Street October\\", and \\"Farmhouse near Glen Williams 1938\\", now in the Firestone Collection of Canadian Art at The Ottawa Art Gallery. Today Glen Williams is a predominantly residential community that provides housing for residents employed in other areas. Glen Williams is home to many visual artists, contains a collection of artist's studios and is a major draw to the area. Glen Williams has a compact community core that includes commercial uses, a restaurant and bakery, the community centre (Town Hall) and other recreational and community functions. This hamlet core is viewed as an important component of the hamlet character. All commercial and community uses are focused in this area. The Williams Mill Visual Arts Centre and Glen Williams Glass are both housed in the heritage site of the Williams Mill. The Williams Mill provides studio space for artists of various media including ceramics, drawing, fibre, glass, jewellery, printmaking, sculpture and offers visitors the opportunity to interact directly with the artists, experience their work in progress and purchase a variety of art. The gallery showcases the works of other renowned artists and craftspeople. Art classes, lectures and workshops for all ages offered year- round in the Arts Education Centre. Glen Williams Glass is a collective studio made up of seven independent glass artists and is also part of The Williams Mill. In addition to its function as an artist's co-operative, Glen Williams Glass regularly welcomes non-members to the studio. The former Beaumont Knitting Mill is now home to Beaumont Mill Antiques & Collectibles, a multi vendor Antique and Collectibles Market offering a broad assortment of collectibles and antiques, including furniture, toys, glassware, cookware, books, decorative items, and vinyl records. Adjacent to the mill is the Kids & Classics Boatshops Museum, a non-profit organization, which focuses on the restoration of classic wood boats, where volunteers learn and teach skills, working with kids-at-risk through a skiff building program for youth. In the space of a weekend, four children build and launch a skiff (the Bevin's skiff), get exposed to the world of boatbuilding and learn to have confidence in themselves and what they can do. Sale of the skiffs built by the youth helps fund the program. Sheridan Nurseries operates their \\"Glen Williams Farm & Distribution Centre\\" along the hamlet's eastern boundary. The farm is their main growing facility and produces more than 800 hardy nursery stock varieties, ranging from evergreens, deciduous trees and shrubs. The Distribution Centre supplies its own nine garden centres in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and ships regularly to destinations in Eastern Canada and the U.S. Midwest to New England. Sheridan Nurseries has been selected as the Glen Williams Citizen of the Year in 2007, 2010 & 2011. ===Annual festivals and events=== * Victoria Day - Fireworks and BBQ * Canada Day (July 1) - Parade, duck race, festival grounds, evening BBQ and fireworks ==Attractions== Copper Kettle Inn The Glen Oven Bakery Cafe and The Copper Kettle Pub are also located in the village. The Copper Kettle Pub is particularly known for its authentic and traditional British fare and atmosphere and for its colourful staff. It occupies the former General Store and Post Office, built in 1852 by Charles Williams. The Glen Fitness Studio is located at 511 Main Street, offering both group fitness exercise programmes and individualized sessions with a personal trainer. The Glen Tavern, occupying one of the lower floors of the Williams Mill Visual Arts Centre, is located at 515 Main Street, offers seasonal, contemporary food, selected wines and drinks in a convivial setting. Three churches serve the village. St. Alban the Martyr Anglican Church, and St. John's United Church are historic buildings still used for worship, and are located on either side of the Credit River on Main Street. Despite the bishop's suggestion that the Glen people would be better off continuing to attend church in Georgetown, the cornerstone of St. Alban the Martyr was laid in 1902, and the church opened in June of following year. The architect was F. S. Baker, the son of a woollen miller in Kilbride, and a friend of Joseph Beaumont. F.S. Baker would later become the second President of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada from 1910‚Äì1912. Union Presbyterian Church is located north-east of the village at Winston Churchill. Glen Williams Park Ballfield ===Glen Williams Park=== Glen Williams Park, 509 Main Street, originally built and maintained by village residents, now maintained by Town of Halton Hills staff, the park includes baseball diamonds, park pavilion, and flower gardens. Open for public use to have a picnic, organize a friendly game of baseball or listen to the sounds of Credit River flowing by. Glen Williams Minor Softball, still played in the park, was established in 1964 by the local hamlet's people. As the need increased for a place to play ball, the land where the park is located today was donated to Glen Minor Ball. The Glen organizers built a major diamond, a concession stand and a minor diamond. The major diamond and booth are still here today. This park is a place created for youth and adult teams to play. Lights were later added on the major diamond so that night games could also be played. Local teams were formed in the Halton area. These local teams included Acton, Limehouse, Hornby, Owma, Lowville, Rockwood, Hillsburg and Glen Williams. These leagues were boys, girls, mens, ladies and senior teams with all age groups from 5 years to 65 years of age. In the 70's on average, you could watch three different age groups play every night of the week and tournaments on weekends. At one point, there were over 300 youth players from Georgetown and Glen Williams. That was then, now only Glen Williams, Hillsburg and Rockwood remain. To keep travel and playing costs down the local teams have created their own mixed co-ed house league located at Glen Williams Ball Park. League teams range from ages 4 up to 19. The league games are Monday through Thursday and Sunday. At Glen Williams Minor Softball everyone who wants to play is welcomed at any time. Their slogan is \\"We don‚Äôt coach softball, we coach kids\\". Youth Divisions currently supported are TBALL for girls and boys ages 4 and 5 years of age, ATOM for girls and boys ages 6 to 8 years of age, SQUIRT, girls and boys ages 9 to 12 years of age, PEE WEE, girls and boys ages 13 and 14 years of age, BANTAM for girls and boys ages 15 and 16 years of age, and MIDGET, for girls and boys ages 17 and 19 years of age. ===Glen Williams Cemetery=== Glen Williams Cemetery The 1840 deed to the Methodist Episcopal church in Glen Williams provided a site for \\"a Church Meeting-House or Chapel and Burying-ground.\\" But the spot down by the river was not an appropriate place for burials, and it does not appear that any took place there. In the Glen the Williams family chose a spot on the hill, overlooking the village, for use as a family cemetery. The earliest stone marks the resting-place of Ira, Elizabeth and Benajah's son, who died in 1833 just eleven days after his fifteenth birthday. Another son, George, lies nearby; he died in 1836, also at the age of 23. A grandson, Alfred (Joel's boy) died in 1844. Photo taken from the Glen Williams Cemetery Look-off in May 2012. Others besides the family used the cemetery. There is a memorial to Robert Brown, who died in 1834. That is on a stone that was put up in 1876, and it is uncertain whether he is buried there. But near the Williams plot there are stones from 1845, for Latham Stull, and for Margaret, wife of Jacob Stull. Benajah Williams died on November 22, 1851. His son Charles must have felt that the time had come for the cemetery to be established on a more regular basis, and on December 22 he made over the land for a public burying- ground, \\"in consideration of the sum of one shilling of lawful money of the Province of Canada to him in hand paid.\\" His brother Joel (now described as a carpenter, rather than a blacksmith as in an earlier deed) and another brother Jacob, were among the first trustees. The others were John Cook and John Stull, yeoman, and Thomas B. Frasier, tailor. The original grant was of one acre, but with the passage of time, more land came to be needed. The oldest section bordered on the road, and is easily distinguished by the old limestone markers in it. In 1905 the Sykes and Ainley mill donated the piece of land between it and the top of the bank of the hill above the river. A further piece was bought for $30 in 1919. It was purchased from John Haines (1870-1932), a native of Somerset, who purchased Fred Cook's orchard and farm next to the cemetery. Then in 1957 Sheridan Nurseries gave a further piece to the cemetery board. The Glen Williams Cemetery continues today as a community cemetery governed by a volunteer Board Of Directors. They do not receive government funding or maintenance assistance but rely on private donations. ==Education== Glen Williams Public School, located at 512 Main Street, is a Junior Kindergarten to Grade 5 Elementary School, with a school library and gymnasium and a large outdoor play area next to the Credit River. Governed by the Halton District School Board with input from the local Glen Williams Parent Council, it is currently home to approximately 220 children. The first frame (as distinct from log) school in the township was built in Glen Williams 1837, replaced by a large, one-room building in 1852. The present school is now housed in a modern building which has seen many additions since it was first erected in the 1950s. This school replaced the overcrowded two-room brick school on Prince Street, which was built in 1873 and has since been converted into a private residence. The Glen Williams Public School also houses before and after school programs in cooperation with the Halton Hills Glen Williams YMCA Centre, a licensed child care centre. The Village Montessori & Child Care is located in Glen Williams at 533 Main Street and is locally owned and operated. Offering a true Montessori Toddler program as well as Casa and School Age programs, accepting all children 15 months to 12 years of age, also offering Mommy and Me programs for infants and toddlers. ==Gallery== File:Charles Williams House, 514 Main Street, Glen Williams, Ontario, Canada.JPGCharles Williams House, 514 Main Street, Glen Williams.

This region is important for the regulation of translation of a transcript by differing mechanisms in viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes. While called untranslated, the 5‚Ä≤ UTR or a portion of it is sometimes translated into a protein product. This product can then regulate the translation of the main coding sequence of the mRNA. In many organisms, however, the 5‚Ä≤ UTR is completely untranslated, instead forming complex secondary structure to regulate translation. The 5‚Ä≤ UTR has been found to interact with proteins relating to metabolism, and proteins translate sequences within the 5‚Ä≤ UTR. In addition, this region has been involved in transcription regulation, such as the sex-lethal gene in Drosophila. Regulatory elements within 5‚Ä≤ UTRs have also been linked to mRNA export. == General structure == === Length === The 5‚Ä≤ UTR begins at the transcription start site and ends one nucleotide (nt) before the initiation sequence (usually AUG) of the coding region. In prokaryotes, the length of the 5‚Ä≤ UTR tends to be 3‚Äì10 nucleotides long, while in eukaryotes it tends to be anywhere from 100 to several thousand nucleotides long. For example, the ste11 transcript in Schizosaccharomyces pombe has a 2273 nucleotide 5‚Ä≤ UTR while the lac operon in Escherichia coli only has seven nucleotides in its 5‚Ä≤ UTR. The differing sizes are likely due to the complexity of the eukaryotic regulation which the 5‚Ä≤ UTR holds as well as the larger pre-initiation complex that must form to begin translation. The 5‚Ä≤ UTR can also be completely missing, in the case of leaderless mRNAs. Ribosomes of all three domains of life accept and translate such mRNAs. Such sequences are naturally found in all three domains of life. Humans have many pressure-related genes under a 2-3 nucleotide leader. Mammals also have other types of ultra-short leaders like the TISU sequence. === Elements === IRP (iron regulatory protein) to and IRE (iron response element), which are hairpin loops, regulate translation. The elements of a eukaryotic and prokaryotic 5‚Ä≤ UTR differ greatly. The prokaryotic 5‚Ä≤ UTR contains a ribosome binding site (RBS), also known as the Shine‚ÄìDalgarno sequence (AGGAGGU), which is usually 3‚Äì10 base pairs upstream from the initiation codon. In contrast, the eukaryotic 5‚Ä≤ UTR contains the Kozak consensus sequence (ACCAUGG), which contains the initiation codon. The eukaryotic 5‚Ä≤ UTR also contains cis-acting regulatory elements called upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and upstream AUGs (uAUGs) and termination codons, which have a great impact on the regulation of translation (see below). Unlike prokaryotes, 5‚Ä≤ UTRs can harbor introns in eukaryotes. In humans, ~35% of all genes harbor introns within the 5‚Ä≤ UTR. === Secondary structure === As the 5‚Ä≤ UTR has high GC content, secondary structures often occur within it. Hairpin loops are one such secondary structure that can be located within the 5‚Ä≤ UTR. These secondary structures also impact the regulation of translation. == Role in translational regulation == The process of translation in bacteria The process of translation in eukaryotes === Prokaryotes === In bacteria, the initiation of translation occurs when IF-3, along with the 30S ribosomal subunit, bind to the Shine‚ÄìDalgarno (SD) sequence of the 5‚Ä≤ UTR. This then recruits many other proteins, such as the 50S ribosomal subunit, which allows for translation to begin. Each of these steps regulates the initiation of translation. Initiation in Archaea is less understood. SD sequences are much rarer, and the initiation factors have more in common with eukaryotic ones. There is no homolog of bacterial IF3. Some mRNAs are leaderless. In both domains, genes without Shine‚ÄìDalgarno sequences are also translated in a less understood manner. A requirement seems to be a lack of secondary structure near the initiation codon. === Eukaryotes === ==== Pre-initiation complex regulation ==== The regulation of translation in eukaryotes is more complex than in prokaryotes. Initially, the eIF4F complex is recruited to the 5‚Ä≤ cap, which in turn recruits the ribosomal complex to the 5‚Ä≤ UTR. Both eIF4E and eIF4G bind the 5‚Ä≤ UTR, which limits the rate at which translational initiation can occur. However, this is not the only regulatory step of translation that involves the 5‚Ä≤ UTR. RNA-binding proteins sometimes serve to prevent the pre- initiation complex from forming. An example is regulation of the msl2 gene. The protein SXL attaches to an intron segment located within the 5‚Ä≤ UTR segment of the primary transcript, which leads to the inclusion of the intron after processing. This sequence allows the recruitment of proteins that bind simultaneously to both the 5‚Ä≤ and 3‚Ä≤ UTR, not allowing translation proteins to assemble. However, it has also been noted that SXL can also repress translation of RNAs that do not contain a poly(A) tail, or more generally, 3‚Ä≤ UTR. The various forms of mRNA and how each affects translational regulation ==== Closed-loop regulation ==== Another important regulator of translation is the interaction between 3‚Ä≤ UTR and the 5‚Ä≤ UTR. Interactions between proteins bound to the 3‚Ä≤ UTR and 5‚Ä≤ UTR causing a circularization that regulates translation. The closed-loop structure inhibits translation. This has been observed in Xenopus laevis, in which eIF4E bound to the 5‚Ä≤ cap interacts with Maskin bound to CPEB on the 3‚Ä≤ UTR, creating translationally inactive transcripts. This translational inhibition is lifted once CPEB is phosphorylated, displacing the Maskin binding site, allowing for the polymerization of the PolyA tail, which can recruit the translational machinery by means of PABP. However, it is important to note that this mechanism has been under great scrutiny. ==== Ferritin regulation ==== Iron levels in cells are maintained by translation regulation of many proteins involved in iron storage and metabolism. The 5‚Ä≤ UTR has the ability to form a hairpin loop secondary structure (known as the iron response element or IRE) that is recognized by iron-regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2). In low levels of iron, the ORF of the target mRNA is blocked as a result of steric hindrance from the binding of IRP1 and IRP2 to the IRE. When iron is high, then the two iron-regulatory proteins do not bind as strongly and allow proteins to be expressed that have a role in iron concentration control. This function has gained some interest after it was revealed that the translation of amyloid precursor protein may be disrupted due to a single-nucleotide polymorphism to the IRE found in the 5‚Ä≤ UTR of its mRNA, leading to a spontaneous increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. ==== uORFs and reinitiation==== Another form of translational regulation in eukaryotes comes from unique elements on the 5‚Ä≤ UTR called upstream open reading frames (uORF). These elements are fairly common, occurring in 35‚Äì49% of all human genes. A uORF is a coding sequence located in the 5‚Ä≤ UTR located upstream of the coding sequences initiation site. These uORFs contain their own initiation codon, known as an upstream AUG (uAUG). This codon can be scanned for by ribosomes and then translated to create a product, which can regulate the translation of the main protein coding sequence or other uORFs that may exist on the same transcript. The translation of the protein within the main ORF after a uORF sequence has been translated is known as reinitiation. The process of reinitiation is known to reduce the translation of the ORF protein. Control of protein regulation is determined by the distance between the uORF and the first codon in the main ORF. A uORF has been found to increase reinitiation with the longer distance between its uAUG and the start codon of the main ORF, which indicates that the ribosome needs to reacquire translation factors before it can carry out translation of the main protein. For example, ATF4 regulation is performed by two uORFs further upstream, named uORF1 and uORF2, which contain three amino acids and fifty-nine amino acids, respectively. The location of uORF2 overlaps with the ATF4 ORF. During normal conditions, the uORF1 is translated, and then translation of uORF2 occurs only after eIF2-TC has been reacquired. Translation of the uORF2 requires that the ribosomes pass by the ATF4 ORF, whose start codon is located within uORF2. This leads to its repression. However, during stress conditions, the 40S ribosome will bypass uORF2 because of a decrease in concentration of eIF2-TC, which means the ribosome does not acquire one in time to translate uORF2. Instead, ATF4 is translated.  Other mechanisms  In addition to reinitiation, uORFs contribute to translation initiation based on: * The nucleotides of an uORF may code for a codon that leads to a highly structured mRNA, causing the ribosome to stall. * cis- and trans- regulation on translation of the main protein coding sequence. * Interactions with IRES sites. An example IRES in the 5‚Ä≤ UTR of the Poliovirus genome ==== Internal ribosome entry sites and viruses ==== Viral (as well as some eukaryotic) 5‚Ä≤ UTRs contain internal ribosome entry sites, which is a cap-independent method of translational activation. Instead of building up a complex at the 5‚Ä≤ cap, the IRES allows for direct binding of the ribosomal complexes to the transcript to begin translation. The IRES enables the viral transcript to translate more efficiently due to the lack of needing a preinitation complex, allowing the virus to replicate quickly. == Role in transcriptional regulation == === msl-2 transcript=== Transcription of the msl-2 transcript is regulated by multiple binding sites for Sxl at the 5‚Ä≤ UTR. In particular, these poly-uracil sites are located close to a small intron that is spliced in males, but kept in females through splicing inhibition. This splicing inhibition is maintained by Sxl. When present, Sxl will repress the translation of msl2 by increasing translation of a start codon located in a uORF in the 5‚Ä≤ UTR (see above for more information on uORFs). Also, Sxl outcompetes TIA-1 to a poly(U) region and prevents snRNP (a step in alternative splicing) recruitment to the 5‚Ä≤ splice site. ==See also== * Three prime untranslated region * UORF * Iron-responsive element-binding protein * Iron response element * Trans-splicing * UTRdb ==References== Category:RNA Category:Gene expression ","title":"Five prime untranslated region"},{"id":"1271019","text":"Specified complexity is a creationist argument introduced by William Dembski, used by advocates to promote intelligent design. According to Dembski, the concept can formalize a property that singles out patterns that are both specified and complex, where in Dembski's terminology, a specified pattern is one that admits short descriptions, whereas a complex pattern is one that is unlikely to occur by chance. Proponents of intelligent design use specified complexity as one of their two main arguments, alongside irreducible complexity. Dembski argues that it is impossible for specified complexity to exist in patterns displayed by configurations formed by unguided processes. Therefore, Dembski argues, the fact that specified complex patterns can be found in living things indicates some kind of guidance in their formation, which is indicative of intelligence. Dembski further argues that one can rigorously show by applying no-free-lunch theorems the inability of evolutionary algorithms to select or generate configurations of high specified complexity. Dembski states that specified complexity is a reliable marker of design by an intelligent agent‚Äîa central tenet to intelligent design, which Dembski argues for in opposition to modern evolutionary theory. Specified complexity is what Dembski terms an \\"explanatory filter\\": one can recognize design by detecting \\"complex specified information\\" (CSI). Dembski argues that the unguided emergence of CSI solely according to known physical laws and chance is highly improbable.Olofsson, P., \\"Intelligent design and mathematical statistics: a troubled alliance\\", Biology and Philosophy, (2008) 23: 545. (pdf, retrieved December 18, 2017) The concept of specified complexity is widely regarded as mathematically unsound and has not been the basis for further independent work in information theory, in the theory of complex systems, or in biology.Mark Perakh, (2005). Dembski \\"displaces Darwinism\\" mathematically -- or does he?Jason Rosenhouse, (2001). How Anti-Evolutionists Abuse Mathematics The Mathematical Intelligencer, Vol. 23, No. 4, Fall 2001, pp. 3‚Äì8. A study by Wesley Elsberry and Jeffrey Shallit states: \\"Dembski's work is riddled with inconsistencies, equivocation, flawed use of mathematics, poor scholarship, and misrepresentation of others' results.\\" Another objection concerns Dembski's calculation of probabilities. According to Martin Nowak, a Harvard professor of mathematics and evolutionary biology, \\"We cannot calculate the probability that an eye came about. We don't have the information to make the calculation.\\" Martin Nowak (2005). Time Magazine, 15 August 2005, page 32 ==Definition== ===Orgel's terminology=== The term \\"specified complexity\\" was originally coined by origin of life researcher Leslie Orgel in his 1973 book The Origins of Life: Molecules and Natural Selection, which proposed that RNA could have evolved through Darwinian natural selection. Orgel used the phrase in discussing the differences between life and non-living structures: > In brief, living organisms are distinguished by their specified complexity. > Crystals are usually taken as the prototypes of simple well-specified > structures, because they consist of a very large number of identical > molecules packed together in a uniform way. Lumps of granite or random > mixtures of polymers are examples of structures that are complex but not > specified. The crystals fail to qualify as living because they lack > complexity; the mixtures of polymers fail to qualify because they lack > specificity.Leslie Orgel (1973). The Origins of Life, p. 189. The phrase was taken up by the creationists Charles Thaxton and Walter L Bradley in a chapter they contributed to the 1994 book The Creation Hypothesis where they discussed \\"design detection\\" and redefined \\"specified complexity\\" as a way of measuring information. Another contribution to the book was written by William A. Dembski, who took this up as the basis of his subsequent work. The term was later employed by physicist Paul Davies to qualify the complexity of living organisms: > Living organisms are mysterious not for their complexity per se, but for > their tightly specified complexityPaul Davies (1999). The Fifth Miracle p. > 112. ===Dembski's definition=== Dembski describes specified complexity as a property in living things which can be observed by intelligent-design proponents. However, whereas Orgel used the term for biological features which are considered in science to have arisen through a process of evolution, Dembski says that it describes features which cannot form through \\"undirected\\" evolution--and concludes that it allows one to infer intelligent design. While Orgel employed the concept in a qualitative way, Dembski's use is intended to be quantitative. Dembski's use of the concept dates to his 1998 monograph The Design Inference. Specified complexity is fundamental to his approach to intelligent design, and each of his subsequent books has also dealt significantly with the concept. He has stated that, in his opinion, \\"if there is a way to detect design, specified complexity is it\\".William A. Dembski (2002). No Free Lunch, p. 19. Dembski asserts that specified complexity is present in a configuration when it can be described by a pattern that displays a large amount of independently specified information and is also complex, which he defines as having a low probability of occurrence. He provides the following examples to demonstrate the concept: \\"A single letter of the alphabet is specified without being complex. A long sentence of random letters is complex without being specified. A Shakespearean sonnet is both complex and specified.\\" William A. Dembski (1999). Intelligent Design, p. 47. In his earlier papers Dembski defined complex specified information (CSI) as being present in a specified event whose probability did not exceed 1 in 10150, which he calls the universal probability bound. In that context, \\"specified\\" meant what in later work he called \\"pre-specified\\", that is specified by the unnamed designer before any information about the outcome is known. The value of the universal probability bound corresponds to the inverse of the upper limit of \\"the total number of [possible] specified events throughout cosmic history\\", as calculated by Dembski.William A. Dembski (2004). The Design Revolution: Answering the Toughest Questions About Intelligent Design, p. 85. Anything below this bound has CSI. The terms \\"specified complexity\\" and \\"complex specified information\\" are used interchangeably. In more recent papers Dembski has redefined the universal probability bound, with reference to another number, corresponding to the total number of bit operations that could possibly have been performed in the entire history of the universe. Dembski asserts that CSI exists in numerous features of living things, such as in DNA and in other functional biological molecules, and argues that it cannot be generated by the only known natural mechanisms of physical law and chance, or by their combination. He argues that this is so because laws can only shift around or lose information, but do not produce it, and because chance can produce complex unspecified information, or simple specified information, but not CSI; he provides a mathematical analysis that he claims demonstrates that law and chance working together cannot generate CSI, either. Moreover, he claims that CSI is holistic, with the whole being greater than the sum of the parts, and that this decisively eliminates Darwinian evolution as a possible means of its \\"creation\\". Dembski maintains that by process of elimination, CSI is best explained as being due to intelligence, and is therefore a reliable indicator of design. ==Law of conservation of information== Dembski formulates and proposes a law of conservation of information as follows: > This strong proscriptive claim, that natural causes can only transmit CSI > but never originate it, I call the Law of Conservation of Information. > Immediate corollaries of the proposed law are the following: # The specified > complexity in a closed system of natural causes remains constant or > decreases. # The specified complexity cannot be generated spontaneously, > originate endogenously or organize itself (as these terms are used in > origins-of-life research). # The specified complexity in a closed system of > natural causes either has been in the system eternally or was at some point > added exogenously (implying that the system, though now closed, was not > always closed). # In particular any closed system of natural causes that is > also of finite duration received whatever specified complexity it contains > before it became a closed system.William A. Dembski (1998) Intelligent > Design as a Theory of Information. Dembski notes that the term \\"Law of Conservation of Information\\" was previously used by Peter Medawar in his book The Limits of Science (1984) \\"to describe the weaker claim that deterministic laws cannot produce novel information.\\" \\"Searching Large Spaces: Displacement and the No Free Lunch Regress (356k PDF)\\", pp. 15-16, describing an argument made by Michael Shermer in How We Believe: Science, Skepticism, and the Search for God, 2nd ed. (2003). The actual validity and utility of Dembski's proposed law are uncertain; it is neither widely used by the scientific community nor cited in mainstream scientific literature. A 2002 essay by Erik Tellgren provided a mathematical rebuttal of Dembski's law and concludes that it is \\"mathematically unsubstantiated.\\" On Dembski's law of conservation of information Erik Tellgren. talkreason.org, 2002. (PDF file) ==Specificity== In a more recent paper,William A. Dembski (2005). Specification: The Pattern that Signifies intelligence Dembski provides an account which he claims is simpler and adheres more closely to the theory of statistical hypothesis testing as formulated by Ronald Fisher. In general terms, Dembski proposes to view design inference as a statistical test to reject a chance hypothesis P on a space of outcomes Œ©. Dembski's proposed test is based on the Kolmogorov complexity of a pattern T that is exhibited by an event E that has occurred. Mathematically, E is a subset of Œ©, the pattern T specifies a set of outcomes in Œ© and E is a subset of T. Quoting Dembski(loc. cit. p. 16) > Thus, the event E might be a die toss that lands six and T might be the > composite event consisting of all die tosses that land on an even face. Kolmogorov complexity provides a measure of the computational resources needed to specify a pattern (such as a DNA sequence or a sequence of alphabetic characters).Michael Sipser (1997). Introduction to the Theory of Computation, PWS Publishing Company. Given a pattern T, the number of other patterns may have Kolmogorov complexity no larger than that of T is denoted by œÜ(T). The number œÜ(T) thus provides a ranking of patterns from the simplest to the most complex. For example, for a pattern T which describes the bacterial flagellum, Dembski claims to obtain the upper bound œÜ(T) ‚â§ 1020. Dembski defines specified complexity of the pattern T under the chance hypothesis P as : \\\\sigma= - \\\\log_2 [R \\\\times \\\\varphi(T) \\\\times \\\\operatorname{P}(T)], where P(T) is the probability of observing the pattern T, R is the number of \\"replicational resources\\" available \\"to witnessing agents\\". R corresponds roughly to repeated attempts to create and discern a pattern. Dembski then asserts that R can be bounded by 10120. This number is supposedly justified by a result of Seth Lloyd in which he determines that the number of elementary logic operations that can have been performed in the universe over its entire history cannot exceed 10120 operations on 1090 bits. Dembski's main claim is that the following test can be used to infer design for a configuration: There is a target pattern T that applies to the configuration and whose specified complexity exceeds 1. This condition can be restated as the inequality : 10^{120} \\\\times \\\\varphi(T) \\\\times \\\\operatorname{P}(T) < \\\\frac{1}{2}. ===Dembski's explanation of specified complexity=== Dembski's expression œÉ is unrelated to any known concept in information theory, though he claims he can justify its relevance as follows: An intelligent agent S witnesses an event E and assigns it to some reference class of events Œ© and within this reference class considers it as satisfying a specification T. Now consider the quantity œÜ(T) √ó P(T) (where P is the \\"chance\\" hypothesis): set-theoretic union does not exceed œÜ(T) √ó P(T) > Think of S as trying to determine whether an archer, who has just shot an > arrow at a large wall, happened to hit a tiny target on that wall by chance. > The arrow, let us say, is indeed sticking squarely in this tiny target. The > problem, however, is that there are lots of other tiny targets on the wall. > Once all those other targets are factored in, is it still unlikely that the > archer could have hit any of them by chance? In addition, we need to factor > in what I call the replicational resources associated with T, that is, all > the opportunities to bring about an event of T's descriptive complexity and > improbability by multiple agents witnessing multiple events. According to Dembski, the number of such \\"replicational resources\\" can be bounded by \\"the maximal number of bit operations that the known, observable universe could have performed throughout its entire multi-billion year history\\", which according to Lloyd is 10120. However, according to Elsberry and Shallit, \\"[specified complexity] has not been defined formally in any reputable peer-reviewed mathematical journal, nor (to the best of our knowledge) adopted by any researcher in information theory.\\" ===Calculation of specified complexity=== Thus far, Dembski's only attempt at calculating the specified complexity of a naturally occurring biological structure is in his book No Free Lunch, for the bacterial flagellum of E. coli. This structure can be described by the pattern \\"bidirectional rotary motor-driven propeller\\". Dembski estimates that there are at most 1020 patterns described by four basic concepts or fewer, and so his test for design will apply if : \\\\operatorname{P}(T) < \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\times 10^{-140}. However, Dembski says that the precise calculation of the relevant probability \\"has yet to be done\\", although he also claims that some methods for calculating these probabilities \\"are now in place\\". These methods assume that all of the constituent parts of the flagellum must have been generated completely at random, a scenario that biologists do not seriously consider. He justifies this approach by appealing to Michael Behe's concept of \\"irreducible complexity\\" (IC), which leads him to assume that the flagellum could not come about by any gradual or step-wise process. The validity of Dembski's particular calculation is thus wholly dependent on Behe's IC concept, and therefore susceptible to its criticisms, of which there are many. To arrive at the ranking upper bound of 1020 patterns, Dembski considers a specification pattern for the flagellum defined by the (natural language) predicate \\"bidirectional rotary motor-driven propeller\\", which he regards as being determined by four independently chosen basic concepts. He furthermore assumes that English has the capability to express at most 105 basic concepts (an upper bound on the size of a dictionary). Dembski then claims that we can obtain the rough upper bound of : 10^{20}= 10^5 \\\\times 10^5 \\\\times 10^5 \\\\times 10^5 for the set of patterns described by four basic concepts or fewer. From the standpoint of Kolmogorov complexity theory, this calculation is problematic. Quoting Ellsberry and Shallit \\"Natural language specification without restriction, as Dembski tacitly permits, seems problematic. For one thing, it results in the Berry paradox\\". These authors add: \\"We have no objection to natural language specifications per se, provided there is some evident way to translate them to Dembski's formal framework. But what, precisely, is the space of events Œ© here?\\" ==Criticism== The soundness of Dembski's concept of specified complexity and the validity of arguments based on this concept are widely disputed. A frequent criticism (see Elsberry and Shallit) is that Dembski has used the terms \\"complexity\\", \\"information\\" and \\"improbability\\" interchangeably. These numbers measure properties of things of different types: Complexity measures how hard it is to describe an object (such as a bitstring), information is how much the uncertainty about the state of an object is reduced by knowing the state of another object or system, and improbability measures how unlikely an event is given a probability distribution. On page 150 of No Free Lunch Dembski claims he can demonstrate his thesis mathematically: \\"In this section I will present an in-principle mathematical argument for why natural causes are incapable of generating complex specified information.\\" When Tellgren investigated Dembski's \\"Law of Conservation of Information‚Äù using a more formal approach, he concluded it is mathematically unsubstantiated. Dembski responded in part that he is not \\"in the business of offering a strict mathematical proof for the inability of material mechanisms to generate specified complexity\\".William A. Dembski, (Aug 2002). If Only Darwinists Scrutinized Their Own Work as Closely: A Response to \\"Erik\\". Jeffrey Shallit states that Demski's mathematical argument has multiple problems, for example; a crucial calculation on page 297 of No Free Lunch is off by a factor of approximately 1065.Jeffrey Shallit (2002) A review of Dembski's No Free Lunch Dembski's calculations show how a simple smooth function cannot gain information. He therefore concludes that there must be a designer to obtain CSI. However, natural selection has a branching mapping from one to many (replication) followed by pruning mapping of the many back down to a few (selection). When information is replicated, some copies can be differently modified while others remain the same, allowing information to increase. These increasing and reductional mappings were not modeled by Dembski. In other words, Dembski's calculations do not model birth and death. This basic flaw in his modeling renders all of Dembski's subsequent calculations and reasoning in No Free Lunch irrelevant because his basic model does not reflect reality. Since the basis of No Free Lunch relies on this flawed argument, the entire thesis of the book collapses.Thomas D. Schneider. (2002) Dissecting Dembski's \\"Complex Specified Information\\" According to Martin Nowak, a Harvard professor of mathematics and evolutionary biology \\"We cannot calculate the probability that an eye came about. We don't have the information to make the calculation\\". Dembski's critics note that specified complexity, as originally defined by Leslie Orgel, is precisely what Darwinian evolution is supposed to create. Critics maintain that Dembski uses \\"complex\\" as most people would use \\"absurdly improbable\\". They also claim that his argument is circular: CSI cannot occur naturally because Dembski has defined it thus. They argue that to successfully demonstrate the existence of CSI, it would be necessary to show that some biological feature undoubtedly has an extremely low probability of occurring by any natural means whatsoever, something which Dembski and others have almost never attempted to do. Such calculations depend on the accurate assessment of numerous contributing probabilities, the determination of which is often necessarily subjective. Hence, CSI can at most provide a \\"very high probability\\", but not absolute certainty. Another criticism refers to the problem of \\"arbitrary but specific outcomes\\". For example, if a coin is tossed randomly 1000 times, the probability of any particular outcome occurring is roughly one in 10300. For any particular specific outcome of the coin-tossing process, the a priori probability (probability measured before event happens) that this pattern occurred is thus one in 10300, which is astronomically smaller than Dembski's universal probability bound of one in 10150. Yet we know that the post hoc probability (probabilitly as observed after event occurs) of its happening is exactly one, since we observed it happening. This is similar to the observation that it is unlikely that any given person will win a lottery, but, eventually, a lottery will have a winner; to argue that it is very unlikely that any one player would win is not the same as proving that there is the same chance that no one will win. Similarly, it has been argued that \\"a space of possibilities is merely being explored, and we, as pattern-seeking animals, are merely imposing patterns, and therefore targets, after the fact.\\" Apart from such theoretical considerations, critics cite reports of evidence of the kind of evolutionary \\"spontanteous generation\\" that Dembski claims is too improbable to occur naturally. For example, in 1982, B.G. Hall published research demonstrating that after removing a gene that allows sugar digestion in certain bacteria, those bacteria, when grown in media rich in sugar, rapidly evolve new sugar-digesting enzymes to replace those removed.B.G. Hall (1982). \\"Evolution of a regulated operon in the laboratory\\", Genetics, 101(3-4):335-44. In PubMed. Another widely cited example is the discovery of nylon eating bacteria that produce enzymes only useful for digesting synthetic materials that did not exist prior to the invention of nylon in 1935. Other commentators have noted that evolution through selection is frequently used to design certain electronic, aeronautic and automotive systems which are considered problems too complex for human \\"intelligent designers\\".Evolutionary algorithms now surpass human designers New Scientist, 28 July 2007 This contradicts the argument that an intelligent designer is required for the most complex systems. Such evolutionary techniques can lead to designs that are difficult to understand or evaluate since no human understands which trade- offs were made in the evolutionary process, something which mimics our poor understanding of biological systems. Dembski's book No Free Lunch was criticised for not addressing the work of researchers who use computer simulations to investigate artificial life. According to Shallit: > The field of artificial life evidently poses a significant challenge to > Dembski's claims about the failure of evolutionary algorithms to generate > complexity. Indeed, artificial life researchers regularly find their > simulations of evolution producing the sorts of novelties and increased > complexity that Dembski claims are impossible. ==See also== *List of topics characterized as pseudoscience *Teleological argument *Texas sharpshooter fallacy ==Notes and references== ==External links== * Not a Free Lunch But a Box of Chocolates - A critique of William Dembski's book No Free Lunch by Richard Wein, from TalkOrigins * Information Theory and Creationism William Dembski by Rich Baldwin, from Information Theory and Creationism, compiled by Ian Musgrave and Rich Baldwin * Critique of No Free Lunch by H.

Mtv.co.uk. Retrieved 10 December 2013.) is a British rock music vocalist, songwriter, guitarist and keyboard player, best known for his 1976 Top 3 UK hit single, \\"Music\\". He won the \\"Outstanding Musical Achievement\\" award at the 2017 Progressive Music Awards. ==Career== ===Background=== While still a pupil at Jarrow Grammar School, Miles was a member of a local band called The Influence, which also included Paul Thompson, later drummer with Roxy Music; and Vic Malcolm, later lead guitarist with Geordie. This outfit released the single \\"I Want to Live\\" (Orange Records, 1969\\"Early Days of Orange.\\" Premierguitar.com (July 2011). Retrieved 28 August 2012.). Following this he formed The John Miles Set before starting his solo career in 1971. ===Success=== Miles signed a recording contract with the Decca UK label in 1975 and issued four albums Rebel (1976), Stranger in the City (1977), Zaragon (1978) and More Miles Per Hour (1979). However, Miles had the most success with singles and released a total of eighteen during this era. In addition to \\"Music\\", he also charted in the UK with \\"Highfly\\" (1975), \\"Remember Yesterday\\" (1976), and \\"Slow Down\\" (1977). Most of his songs were co-written with the bassist in his backing group, Bob Marshall. At the peak of his success, in 1976 and 1977, Miles made several appearances on the weekly pop TV show Supersonic. The debut album did receive some attention in the US. Two singles from the debut album reached the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, \\"Highfly\\" peaked at No. 68, followed by \\"Music\\" which stalled at No. 88. \\"Slow Down\\" was his biggest US chart hit, peaking at No. 2 on the disco chart, and at No. 34 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1977. It was later featured in the 1979 film Players, starring Ali MacGraw and Dean Paul Martin. In the 1980s, Miles continued to record and tour. In 1983 a new radio station in the South of England, Radio Mercury, used parts from the song \\"Music\\" for their link jingles. The song itself was played frequently on the station. ===Later career=== Since 1985, Miles has participated almost every year in the Night of the Proms, a series of concerts held yearly in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, Poland, Denmark and the United States. Regularly there are also shows in Spain, France, Austria, Switzerland and Sweden. The concerts consist of a combination of pop music and popular classical music (often combined) and various well-known musicians and groups usually participate. Miles always performs \\"Music\\", and also sings other songs. In 2009, an album The Best of John Miles at the Night of the Proms was released, which included \\"Music\\" and cover versions including \\"All by Myself\\", \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and \\"It Was a Very Good Year\\". Miles has also toured with Tina Turner since 1987, playing keyboards, guitar and supporting vocals on every one of her tours, and played on several of her albums. He also appeared on Jimmy Page's 1988 album Outrider and subsequent tour, and played Hammond organ on Joe Cocker's album Night Calls (1992). In 1990, Miles participated in the UK heat of A Song for Europe with the song \\"Where I Belong\\", which came second. Miles was also a frequent guest vocalist on albums by The Alan Parsons Project, being featured on Tales of Mystery and Imagination (1976), Pyramid (1978), Stereotomy (1985), and Gaudi (1987), as well as on the Eric Woolfson album Freudiana (1990). His first DVD, John Miles ‚Äì Live in Concert was released in 2002. In 2007, Miles performed in Gelsenkirchen, Germany with German band Pur and sang two songs. One of those songs, \\"Abenteuerland\\", Miles sang with Pur in German. The concert is available on the DVD, Pur-Friends-Live-Schalke-2007. In October 2008, Miles began touring once again with Tina Turner until May 2009. ==Family== Miles' son, John Miles Jr., is also a musician. Born in London, he has played with bands including Milk Inc., Sylver, The Urge and Fixate. ==Discography== ==See also== *List of performers on Top of the Pops *List of artists under the Decca Records label *List of 1970s one-hit wonders in the United States *Orange Records ==References== ==External links== *Unofficial website * Category:1949 births Category:English guitarists Category:English male guitarists Category:English keyboardists Category:English male singers Category:English songwriters Category:Living people Category:People from Jarrow Category:London Records artists Category:Decca Records artists Category:EMI Records artists ","title":"John Miles (musician)"},{"id":"1271029","text":"Nanise Nagusuca (born 1953) is a former Fijian politician, who was elected to the House of Representatives in a special election on December 11, 2004.

It is best known for its use in tropical drinks. It contains flavors of ginger, lime, and almond, and most often also of cloves or allspice. It may be thought of as a spicier version of orgeat syrup. The form can be alcoholic (syrup liqueur) or nonalcoholic (syrup). Versions with alcohol are generally lower in proof (‚âÖ15 ABV), adding rum and emphasizing the clove, ginger, or allspice flavoring aspects for use in mixing cocktails, typically tropical or tiki drinks. It is also enjoyed on the rocks. Depending on sugar content, the consistency is often thick and is therefore sometimes referred to as \\"velvet falernum\\" because of the feeling it leaves on one's tongue. Brands vary and the color can be white to light amber, and it may be clear or translucent. ==History== The origination of falernum may date back to the 18th century, when it was made as a punch in the areas around Barbados. Some disagreement exists over the origin of the name, and whether the earliest versions would have included the steeping of almonds. The same references also assert that earlier versions contained bitters such as wormwood. The inclusion of bitters historically would seem to be corroborated by a 1982 article appearing in The New York Times. In the literary magazine All the Year Round, owned by Charles Dickens Jr. at the time, an unnamed author wrote of falernum in 1892, describing it as \\"a curious liqueur composed from rum and lime-juice\\".Dickens, Charles, All the Year Round, \\"Our Quarters in Barbados\\", March 12, 1892, at p. 257, https://books.google.com/books?id=9DsBAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA257.

He was named Crown Prince of Jordan in 1999, a position he held until his half-brother, King Abdullah II, rescinded it in 2004. Queen Noor states in her autobiography that she and King Hussein named Hamzah after Hamza ibn ‚ÄòAbd al-Muttalib. ==Biography== Born on 29 March 1980, Prince Hamzah Bin Al Hussein claims ancestry with the Islamic Prophet Mohammad through the Hashemite family. King Abdullah II officially named him as Crown Prince of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on 7 February 1999, a position he held until 28 November 2004. Prince Hamzah received his elementary education in Jordan and Amman, and then attended Harrow School in England. He then joined the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, passing out as a commissioned officer in the Jordan Arab Legion in December 1999, with a number of prizes including the Sandhurst Overseas Sword, granted to the best overseas cadet and the HRH Prince Saud Abdullah Prize, presented to the cadet with the best aggregate mark in academic subjects. Serving then as an officer in the Jordan Arab Army‚Äôs 40th Armored Brigade, Prince Hamzah attended a number of military courses and attachments in Jordan, the UK, Poland, Germany and the US. Currently holding the rank of Brigadier in the Jordan Arab Army, he served with the Jordan-United Arab Emirates force operating in former Yugoslavia under the umbrella of international peacekeepers. In the year 2006, he graduated from Harvard University. Prince Hamzah was sworn in as Regent on numerous occasions and deputized for King Abdullah II on a number of missions in the Kingdom and abroad. He heads the Royal Advisory Committee on the Energy Sector. He is also the Honorary President of the Jordan Basketball Federation, and is the Chairman of the board of trustees of the Royal Automobile Museum, the President of the Royal Aero sports Club of Jordan and the President of Al-Shajarah (Tree) Protection Society. Prince Hamzah is a qualified rotor and fixed wing aircraft pilot and enjoys other sports such as Jujitsu and target-shooting. ==Education== The Prince attended Harrow, UK, and graduated from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. He also graduated from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, UK. He has conducted a variety of courses as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Arab Jordanian Army. ==Succession issue== On 7 February 1999 King Hussein died and his eldest son Prince Abdullah bin Hussein acceded to the throne of Jordan, having two weeks previously been designated to succeed his father as ruler in place of the king's brother, Crown Prince Hassan bin Talal. On the same day, in compliance with his father's wish, King Abdullah II decreed that he, in turn, would be succeeded not by a son of his own but by his half-brother, Prince Hamzah, who was therefore accorded the title of crown prince. Nearly six years later, on 28 November 2004, King Abdullah removed Hamzah as crown prince. In a letter from Abdullah to Hamzah, read on Jordanian state television, he said, \\"Your holding this symbolic position has restrained your freedom and hindered our entrusting you with certain responsibilities that you are fully qualified to undertake.\\" No successor to the title was named at the time, but some analysts believed it probable that Abdullah intended to name his own son, Prince Hussein, to succeed him at some point in the future. Article 28(B) of Jordan's constitution provides that the king's eldest son automatically succeeds to the crown upon the monarch's death unless the king has designated one of his brothers to inherit the throne as crown prince, but Abdullah II confirmed that his son Hussein would succeed him by designating him as crown prince on 2 July 2009. ==Marriage and family== ===First marriage=== Prince Hamzah married his second cousin, Princess Noor bint Asem bin Nayef, at Al Baraka Palace in Amman on 29 August 2003. The official wedding was held on 27 May 2004. Prince Hamzah and Princess Noor divorced on 9 September 2009. The couple had one daughter: * Princess Haya bint Hamzah (born 18 April 2007) ===Second marriage=== On 12 January 2012, Prince Hamzah married Basmah Bani Ahmad. The couple have 4 daughters and a son: * Princess Zein bint Hamzah (born 3 November 2012) * Princess Noor bint Hamzah (born 5 July 2014) * Princess Badiya bint Hamzah (born 8 April 2016) * Princess Nafisa bint Hamzah (born 7 February 2018) * Prince Hussein bin Hamzah (born 8 November 2019) ==Personal interests== Prince Hamzah's interests include piloting helicopters, shooting, parachuting, sky diving, motorcycling, and practicing some water sports. Brazilian jiu-jitsu is among his interests. He also spends time reading, particularly history books and biographies. ==Honours== ===National=== * **Knight Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance, Special ClassHamzah's Biography, ¬© 1998, The Royal Hashemite Courthttp://www.hola.com/imagenes/realeza/2004012723865/casasreales/noticias/casasreales/bodajordania/0-72-672/2004-01-27-a.jpgHamzah Wearing all his national honoursHamzah Wearing the Ribbon Bars of his honoursHamzah Wearing and Order and Medals **Knight Grand Cordon of the Order of the Star of Jordan **Knight Grand Cordon of the Order of Independence **Knight Officer of the Order of Military Merit ===Foreign=== * Recipient of the Medal of Ahmad Al-Fateh * : Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian RepublicItalian Presidency Website, S.A.R.

The Principal Species of Wood: Their Characteristic Properties. 2nd ed. New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1908. Page 56. is a species of walnut native to the eastern United States and southeast Canada. == Distribution == The distribution range of J. cinerea extends east to New Brunswick, and from southern Quebec west to Minnesota, south to northern Alabama and southwest to northern Arkansas.Sargent, Charles Sprague. The Woods of the United States. New York: D. Appleton & Co., 1885. Page 238. Snow, cited above, says \\"New Brunswick to Georgia, westward to Dakota and Arkansas. Best in Ohio River Basin\\". It is absent from most of the Southern United States. The species also proliferates at middle elevations (about above sea level) in the Columbia River basin, Pacific Northwest; as an off-site species. Trees with (over mature) class range diameter at breast height were noted in the Imnaha River drainage as late as January 26, 2015. Butternut favors a cooler climate than black walnut and its range does not extend into the Deep South. Its northern range extends into Wisconsin and Minnesota where the growing season is too short for black walnut. == Description == J. cinerea is a deciduous tree growing to tall, rarely . Butternut is a slow-growing species, and rarely lives longer than 75 years. It has a stem diameter, with light gray bark. The leaves are alternate and pinnate, long, with 11‚Äì17 leaflets, each leaflet long and broad. Leaves have a terminal leaflet at the end of the leafstalk and have an odd number of leaflets. The whole leaf is downy-pubescent, and a somewhat brighter, yellower green than many other tree leaves. === Flowering and fruiting === A butternut Like other members of the family Juglandaceae, butternut's leafout in spring is tied to photoperiod rather than air temperature and occurs when daylight length reaches 14 hours. This can vary by up to a month in the northern and southernmost extents of its range. Leaf drop in fall is early and is initiated when daylight drops to 11 hours. The species is monoecious. Male (staminate) flowers are inconspicuous, yellow-green slender catkins that develop from auxiliary buds and female (pistillate) flowers are short terminal spikes on current year's shoots. Each female flower has a light pink stigma. Flowers of both sexes do not usually mature simultaneously on any individual tree. The fruit is a lemon-shaped nut, produced in bunches of two to six together; the nut is oblong-ovoid, long and broad, surrounded by a green husk before maturity in midautumn. Fossilized Juglans cinerea (fossil white walnut) in Pleistocene glacial sediments, Michigan == Ecology == === Soil and topography === Butternut grows best on stream banks and on well-drained soils. It is seldom found on dry, compact, or infertile soils. It grows better than black walnut, however, on dry, rocky soils, especially those of limestone origin. Butternut's range includes the rocky soils of New England where black walnut is largely absent. Butternut is found most frequently in coves, on stream benches and terraces, on slopes, in the talus of rock ledges, and on other sites with good drainage. It is found up to an elevation of in the Virginias ‚Äì much higher altitudes than black walnut. === Associated forest cover === Butternut is found with many other tree species in several hardwood types in the mixed mesophytic forest. It is an associated species in the following four northern and central forest cover types: sugar maple‚Äìbasswood, yellow poplar‚Äìwhite oak‚Äìnorthern red oak, beech‚Äìsugar maple, and river birch‚Äìsycamore. Commonly associated trees include basswood (Tilia spp.), black cherry (Prunus serotina), beech (Fagus grandifolia), black walnut (Juglans nigra), elm (Ulmus spp.), hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), hickory (Carya spp.), oak (Quercus spp.), red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). In the northeast part of its range, it is often found with sweet birch (Betula lenta) and in the northern part of its range it is occasionally found with white pine (Pinus strobus). Forest stands seldom contain more than an occasional butternut tree, although in local areas, it may be abundant. In the past, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Tennessee have been the leading producers of butternut timber. ==== Canopy competition ==== Although young trees may withstand competition from the side, butternut does not survive under shade from above. It must be in the overstory to thrive. Therefore, it is classed as intolerant of shade and competition. === Diseases === Butternuts killed by butternut canker ==== Butternut canker ==== The most serious disease of J. cinerea is butternut decline or butternut canker. In the past, the causal organism of this disease was thought to be a fungus, Melanconis juglandis. Now this fungus has been associated with secondary infections and the primary causal organism of the disease has been identified as another species of fungus, Sirococcus clavigignenti- juglandacearum. The fungus is spread by wide-ranging vectors, so isolation of a tree offers no protection. Butternut canker first entered the United States around the beginning of the 20th century, when it arrived on imported nursery stock of Japanese walnut. Symptoms of the disease include dying branches and stems. Initially, cankers develop on branches in the lower crown. Spores developing on these dying branches are spread by rainwater to tree stems. Stem cankers develop 1 to 3 years after branches die. Tree tops killed by stem- girdling cankers do not resprout. Diseased trees usually die within several years. Completely free-standing trees seem better able to withstand the fungus than those growing in dense stands or forest. In some areas, 90% of the butternut trees have been killed. The disease is reported to have eliminated butternut from North and South Carolina. The disease is also reported to be spreading rapidly in Wisconsin. By contrast, black walnut seems to be resistant to the disease. ==== Hybrid resistance ==== Butternut hybridizes readily with Japanese walnut. The hybrid between butternut and the Japanese walnut is commonly known as the 'buartnut' and inherits Japanese walnut's resistance to the disease. Researchers are back-crossing butternut to buartnut, creating 'butter-buarts\\" which should have more butternut traits than buartnuts. They are selecting for resistance to the disease. Most butternuts found as landscaping trees are buartnuts rather than the pure species. ==== Other pests ==== Bunch disease also attacks butternut. Currently, the causal agent is thought to be a mycoplasma-like organism. Symptoms include a yellow witches' broom resulting from sprouting and growth of auxiliary buds that would normally remain dormant. Infected branches fail to become dormant in the fall and are killed by frost; highly susceptible trees may eventually be killed. Butternut seems to be more susceptible to this disease than black walnut. The common grackle has been reported to destroy immature fruit and may be considered a butternut pest when populations are high. Butternut is very susceptible to fire damage, and although the species is generally wind firm, it is subject to frequent storm damage. === Conservation === The species is not listed as threatened federally in the US, but is listed as \\"Special Concern\\" in Kentucky, \\"Exploitably Vulnerable\\" in New York State, and \\"Threatened\\" in Tennessee.PLANTS Profile for Juglans cinerea (butternut)  USDA PLANTS The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada placed the butternut on the endangered species list in Canada in 2005. ==Famous specimens== The American Forest National Champion is located in Oneida, New York. In 2016 its circumference at breast height was , the height was , and the spread was . In Louisa May Alcott's Little Men (1871) the two youngest boys, Rob and Teddy, have an amusing running battle with the squirrels over collecting the butternuts. \\"Bush butternut\\" was planted by settler George Bush (1845) in current Tumwater, Washington, brought from Missouri. This tree stands living in 2019. == Uses == Cross-sections from The American Woods The butternuts are eaten by wildlife and were made into oil by Native Americans for various purposes, including anointment. The husks contain a natural yellow-orange dye. === Lumber === Butternut wood is light in weight and takes polish well, and is highly rot resistant, but is much softer than black walnut wood. Oiled, the grain of the wood usually shows much light. It is often used to make furniture, and is a favorite of woodcarvers. === Fabric dye === Butternut bark and nut rinds were once often used to dye cloth to colors between light yellowSnow, Charles Henry. The Principal Species of Wood: Their Characteristic Properties. 2nd ed. New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1908. Page 56. and dark brown.Saunders, Charles Francis. Useful Wild Plants of the United States and Canada. New York: Robert M. McBride & Co., 1920. Page 227. To produce the darker colors, the bark is boiled to concentrate the color. This appears to never have been used as a commercial dye, but rather was used to color homespun cloth. In the mid-19th century, inhabitants of areas such as southern Illinois and southern Indiana ‚Äì many of whom had moved there from the Southern United States ‚Äì were known as \\"butternuts\\" from the butternut-dyed homespun cloth that some of them wore. Later, during the American Civil War, the term \\"butternut\\" was sometimes applied to Confederate soldiers. Some Confederate uniforms apparently faded from gray to a tan or light brown. It is also possible that butternut was used to color the cloth worn by a small number of Confederate soldiers.Saunders, Charles Francis. Useful Wild Plants of the United States and Canada. New York: Robert M. McBride & Co., 1920. Page 227. The resemblance of these uniforms to butternut-dyed clothing, and the association of butternut dye with home-made clothing, resulted in this derisive nickname. === Fishing === Crushed fruits can be used to poison fish, though the practice is illegal in most jurisdictions. Bruised fruit husks of the closely related black walnut can be used to stun fish.Petrides, G. A., & Wehr, J. (1998). Eastern Trees.

Having begun in 1991, they sold approximately 5,200,000 copies of their albums as of 2004. Initially intending to mix dancehall with traditional Brazilian styles, later the band changed its sonority to music closer to Britpop and local movement Clube da Esquina. ==Biography== In 1983, Samuel Rosa (guitars, vocals) and Henrique Portugal (keyboards) started to play in a reggae band called \\"Pouso Alto\\", along with Dinho Mour√£o (drums) and his brother Alexandre (bass). In 1991, Pouso Alto arranged for a performance in S√£o Paulo, but due to the Mour√£o brothers not being in Belo Horizonte, bassist Lelo Zaneti and drummer Haroldo Ferretti were called for the gig. The band premiered on June 5, 1991, and due to the performance competing with the Campeonato Paulista final match, the audience was 37 people. After the show, the group changed its name to Skank, inspired by Bob Marley's song \\"Easy skanking\\", and began to perform regularly at \\"Mister Beef\\" churrascaria in Belo Horizonte. ===Skank (1992/1993)=== After playing for some time in churrascarias, bars and clubhouses, the band spent US$10,000 in their first album, Skank, released as an independent CD in late 1992 with 3,000 copies, fully paid by the band members themselves. In 45 days, 1,200 were sold,Revista Bizz, 1993 O Brasil vai dan√ßar and Sony Music signed the band as the first Brazilian act in its Chaos label. Skank was re-released in April 1993. The singles \\"O Homem Que Sabia Demais\\", \\"Tanto\\" (version of Bob Dylan's \\"I Want You\\") and \\"In(Dig)Na√ß√£o\\" took the group on a 120 concerts tour around Brazil, and the album sold 250 thousand copies. ===Calango (1994)=== Calango (1994) was the first record produced by Dudu Marote. \\"√â Proibido Fumar\\", \\"Te Ver\\", \\"Pacato Cidad√£o\\", \\"Esmola\\" and \\"Jackie Tequila\\" were hits, and Calango sold around 1,200,000 copies.Revista Oi ===O Samba Pocon√© (1996)=== O Samba Pocon√© was released in 1996. The album had three big hits, \\"T√£o Seu\\", \\"√â Uma Partida de Futebol\\", included by FIFA in the official soundtrack for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and \\"Garota Nacional\\", which topped the Spanish charts for three monthsO Fuxico (under the Spanish title \\"Chica Nacional\\"), was the only Portuguese language song in the Sony Music compilation Soundtrack for a Century, released in 1997 to celebrate the company's centennial, and took the group on tour in Argentina, Chile, United States, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Portugal. Although \\"Garota Nacional\\" literally translates to \\"national girl\\", the song is not about the women of Brazil: it celebrates the \\"girls of Bar Nacional\\", a bar and nightclub in Belo Horizonte famous in the early 1990s for the beauty of its female patrons. Manu Chao featured in \\"Sem Terra\\", \\"Los Pretos\\" e \\"Z√© Trindade\\". \\"O Samba Pocon√©\\" sold 1,800,000 c√≥pias - 800,000 of those in two months. ===Siderado (1998)=== Siderado, produced by John Shaw (UB40) and Paul Ralphes, begins the band's movement towards a more rock and roll sound. The Clube da Esquina-influenced \\"Resposta\\" (re-recorded in 1999 by Milton Nascimento and L√¥ Borges, the latter the song's co-author with Samuel Rosa and Nando Reis), \\"Mandrake e Os Cubanos\\" and \\"Saideira\\" were hits. Released in 1998, Siderado sold 750 thousand copies.Revista Oi Da√∫de and Uakti participated as guest artists. In 1999 Skank recorded a Spanish language version for \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\" in a tribute album for The Police entitled Outlandos d'America. ===Maquinarama (2000)=== With Maquinarama, the band begins in earnest its move away from the ska and reggae sound towards a more rock oriented one influence by The Beatles, Clube da Esquina, Britpop and contemporary alternative rock. Maquinarama, produced by Chico Neves and Tom Capone and released in July 2000, sold 275 thousand copies. Some of the hit singles were \\"Tr√™s Lados\\", \\"Balada do Amor Inabal√°vel\\" and \\"Can√ß√£o Noturna\\". The original cover shows a Cadillac with graffiti by Californian artist Kenny Scharf. The international version has a different cover. ===MTV ao vivo (2001)=== In 2001, Skank recorded the first live album in Ouro Preto as part of the MTV Brasil's series \\"MTV Ao Vivo\\". MTV Ao Vivo sold 600 thousand copies. Besides a list of hits chosen by fans through Skank's website, the album had the new song \\"Acima do Sol\\", a national hit. In 2002 Samuel Rosa played acoustic guitar in \\"√â Proibido Fumar\\", from the Ac√∫stico MTV (MTV Unplugged) by Roberto Carlos. ===Cosmotron (2003)=== Cosmotron, produced by Skank and Tom Capone, was released in July 2003 and sold 250 thousand copies - a disappointment next to their vigorous previous sales figures. Nevertheless, the album had many radio and ringtone hits. \\"Supernova\\", \\"Dois Rios\\", \\"Vou Deixar\\" and \\"Amores Imperfeitos\\" were the main tracks. Cosmotron won the Latin Grammy - best Brazilian rock album award in 2004. ===Radiola (2004)=== Released in October 2004, Radiola was the first compilation album by Skank. It included four new songs, including the Gilberto Gil cover \\"Vamos Fugir\\". The cover reproduces a painting by the hyped Los Angeles artists the Clayton Brothers. Radiola sold 200 thousand copies. ===Carrossel (2006)=== In March 2006 Skank began recording the new album Carrossel in their studio in Belo Horizonte, with producers Chico Neves, who also worked in Maquinarama, and Carlos Eduardo Miranda, producer of O Rappa's Unplugged album. Released in August, the album had the semi-hits \\"Uma Can√ß√£o √â Pra Isso\\" and \\"Mil Acasos\\". Arnaldo Antunes (\\"Trancoso\\"), C√©sar Mauricio (\\"Lugar\\") and Humberto Effe (\\"Cara Nua\\" and \\"Not√≠cia\\") were the songwriting partners. ===Estandarte (2008)=== In 2008, the band reunited with Dudu Marote, who produced Calango and O Samba Pocon√©, to record the album Estandarte in their studio in Belo Horizonte. Released in September, the album had low sales, but produced the hits \\"Ainda Gosto Dela\\" (featuring Negra Li), \\"Sutilmente\\" (a massive number 1 hit in Brazil) and \\"Noites de um Ver√£o Qualquer.\\" ===Multishow ao Vivo (2010)=== On June 19, 2010, Skank performed a free concert on the Mineir√£o stadium in Belo Horizonte. It was the last event before the venue was closed to reform in order to accommodate the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The show was recorded for the live album and DVD Multishow Ao Vivo - Skank no Mineir√£o, which featured two new songs, \\"De Repente\\" and \\"Fotos na Estante\\".Skank anuncia show de gra√ßa no Mineir√£o dia 19 de junho , Hoje em Dia ==International career== Skank had some success with \\"Garota Nacional\\", that lead the Spanish charts, and \\"√â Uma Partida de Futebol\\" was shown before some games of the 1998 World Cup due to being in the championship's soundtrack. By the time of O Samba Pocon√©, the group toured through Hispanic America and Europe, and appeared in big festivals such as Super Bock/Super Rock 1997 in Portugal, P√°leo Festival 97 and St. Gallen 98 in Switzerland, Montreux Jazz Festival 2001, and SummerStage 2002 in New York City. The group also played in two editions of Rock in Rio, at the 2008 Rock in Rio Lisboa and the fourth Brazilian edition of the festival in 2011. Skank had been previously called for Rock in Rio II] in 2001, but went out along with other Brazilian bands in protest against O Rappa's exclusion. However, the band never invested much in its international career. Some songs received versions in Spanish, such as \\"Chica Nacional\\" (\\"Garota Nacional\\"), and \\"Respuesta\\" (\\"Resposta\\"), but foreign shows are usually in places with many Brazilians, such as Miami and New York City. == Members == *Samuel Rosa - lead vocals, electric and occasional acoustic guitars *Lelo Zaneti - bass, backing vocals *Henrique Portugal - keyboard, backing vocals *Haroldo Ferretti - drums ;Current touring members *Paulo M√°rcio - trumpet (1998‚Äìpresent) *Doca Rolim - acoustic and electric guitars, occasional backing vocals (2003‚Äìpresent) *Pedro Aristides - trombone (2003‚Äìpresent) *Vin√≠cius Augustus - saxophone (2008‚Äìpresent) ;Former touring members * Marcos Gauguin - electric guitar (1991) * Chico Amaral - saxophone (1991‚Äì98, 2017), acoustic guitar (on Maquinarama tour) * Jo√£o Vianna - trumpet (1991‚Äì98) * Ed Maciel - trombone (1994‚Äì96) * Edivaldo Silva - trombone (1996‚Äì98) * Jorge Continentino - saxophone (1999-2001) * Wagner Mayer - trombone (1999-2001) == Discography == ;Studio Albums { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !

Foran also prosecuted several police officers caught on film beating the protestors with clubs. In the animated film Chicago 10, his voice was provided by Nick Nolte. In the 2020 film The Trial of the Chicago 7 he was portrayed by actor J.C. MacKenzie. Mr. Foran was a senior partner in Foran & Schultz, the firm he founded in 1957. His name was one of the brightest in his city's legal profession, but to the outside world it was inextricably linked to some leading characters of a turbulent era. There were Abbie Hoffman, Bobby Seale, and Jerry Rubin, who took their Vietnam War protests to the streets. There was William M. Kunstler, the raspy-voiced defender of unpopular people and causes. There was Judge Julius J. Hoffman, an equally combative presence on the bench of Federal District Court. And there was Mr. Foran, the United States attorney and doggedly determined prosecutor. The seven defendants at the four-and-a-half-month trial stood accused of inciting the riots that swirled around the Democratic National Convention in 1968. Mr. Foran and his prosecuting team obtained convictions against five of them‚ÄîDavid Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Mr. Rubin, Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Davis‚Äîfor the lesser charge of crossing state lines with intent to incite a riot; two defendants were acquitted, Lee Weiner and John R. Froines. Judge Hoffman imposed prison sentences on the five, as well as on Mr. Kunstler, whom he held in contempt. None of them served any time in prison because an appeals court threw out the convictions and rebuked Judge Hoffman for unseemly conduct in court and procedural errors. Thomas Foran was born in Chicago. He interrupted his college education to serve as a torpedo bomber pilot in the Pacific in World War II. After the war, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Loyola University and received his law degree at the University of Detroit in 1950. In private practice, he established a solid reputation as an expert in eminent domain law, representing the City of Chicago in major public works projects. But he also acted as counsel for property owners. As a United States attorney, from 1968 to 1970, he established a remarkable conviction record in the fight against organized crime, successfully prosecuting more than 150 people. Mr. Foran is survived by his wife of nearly 50 years, Jean Burke Foran; three sons, John, Edmund and Stephen; three daughters, Elizabeth, Julie, and Regina; a brother, Dr. John Foran; a sister, Grace Szalinski; and 16 grandchildren. He died in Lake Forest, Illinois, on August 6, 2000, surrounded by his family. ==References== Category:1924 births Category:2000 deaths Category:United States Attorneys for the Northern District of Illinois ","title":"Tom Foran"},{"id":"1271099","text":"Youth reading, 1625‚Äì26 Reza Abbasi, Riza yi-Abbasi or Reza-e Abbasi, ÿ±ÿ∂ÿß ÿπÿ®ÿßÿ≥€å in Persian, usually Reza Abbasi also Aqa Reza (see below) or ƒÄqƒÅ Ri≈ºƒÅ KƒÅshƒÅnƒ´ ( ‚Äì 1635) was the leading Persian miniaturist of the Isfahan School during the later Safavid period, spending most of his career working for Shah Abbas I.Brend, 165 He is considered to be the last great master of the Persian miniature, best known for his single miniatures for muraqqa or albums, especially single figures of beautiful youths. ==Life and art== Riza was possibly born in Kashan, as ƒÄqƒÅ Ri≈ºƒÅ KƒÅshƒÅnƒ´ is one of the versions of his name; it has also been suggested that he was born in Mashad, where his father, the miniature artist Ali Asghar, is recorded as having worked in the atelier of the governor, Prince Ibrahim Mirza.Grove After Ibrahim's murder, Ali Asghar joined Shah Ismail II's workshop in the capital Qasvin.Titley, 108 Riza probably received his training from his father and joined the workshop of Shah Abbas I at a young age. By this date, the number of royal commissions for illustrated books had diminished, and had been replaced by album miniatures in terms of employment given to the artists of the royal workshop.Brend, 165-166: Grove Unlike most earlier Persian artists, he typically signed his work, often giving dates and other details as well, though there are many pieces with signatures that scholars now reject.Canby (1996), Appendix III and passim He may have worked on the ambitious, but incomplete Shahnameh, now in the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin.Canby (1996), 181, allows him four of the miniatures A much later copy of the work, from 1628, at the end of Abbas' reign and rendered in a very different style, may also be his. It is now in the British Library (MS Additional 27258).Titley, 108-109, 114 His first dated drawing is from 1601, in the Topkapi Palace.Grove A book miniature of 1601-2 in the National Library of Russia has been attributed to him; the only other miniature in the book is probably by his father.Canby (2009), 176 He is generally attributed with the 19 miniatures in a Khusraw and Shirin of 1631-32, although their quality has been criticised.Canby (1996), 193, items 75-93 His speciality, however, was the single miniature for the albums or muraqqas of private collectors, typically showing one or two figures with a lightly drawn garden background, sometimes in gold, in the style formerly used for border paintings, with individual plants dotted about on a plain background. These vary between pure pen drawings and fully painted subjects with colour throughout, with several intermediate varieties. The most typical have at least some colour in the figures, though not in the background; later works tend to have less colour. His, or his buyers', favourite subjects were idealized figures of stylishly dressed and beautiful young men. According to Barbara Brend: > The line of Riza's ink drawings has an absolute mastery conveying texture, > form, movement and even personality. His coloured figures, which must often > be portraits, are more restrained and lay more emphasis on the fashions of > the day, the rich textiles, the carelessly draped turban, the European hat. > Effete figures are often presented standing in a curved posture which > accentuates their well-fed waists.Brend, 165-166 The style he pioneered remained influential on subsequent generations of Persian painters; several pupils were prominent artists, including Mo'en Mosavver, who painted his portrait many decades later (illustrated at top) as well as Riza's son, Muhammed Shafi Abbasi.Grove His earlier works were signed Aqa Risa (or Riza, Reza etc., depending on the transliteration used), which, confusingly, is also the name of a contemporary Persian artist who worked for the Mughal Emperor Jahangir in India. In 1603, at the age of about 38, the artist in Persia received the honorific title of Abbasi from his patron, the shah, associating him with his name. In the early 20th century, there was much scholarly debate, mostly in German, as to whether the later Aqa Risa and Riza Abbasi were the same figures. It is now accepted that they were, although his style shows a considerable shift in mid-career.Titley, 114; Grove; Gray, 80-81 represents an older view Riza Abbasi, the painter, is also not to be confused with his contemporary Ali Riza Abbasi, Shah Abbas' favourite calligrapher, who in 1598, was appointed to the important position of royal librarian, and therefore in charge of the royal atelier of painters and calligraphers. Both Rizas accompanied the shah on his campaign to Khurasan in 1598 and followed him to the new capital he established in Isfahan from 1597-98.Canby (2009), 36; see also the calligrapher's biography in Encyclopedia Iranica Soon after, Riza Abbasi left the Shah's employ in a \\"mid-life crisis\\",Grove apparently seeking greater independence and freedom to associate with Isfahan's \\"low- life\\" world, including athletes, wrestlers and other unrespectable types.Grove; Brend, 165; Titley, 114. Both contemporary sources and the female scholars who dominate the study of the Persian miniature show little patience with Riza's mid-life interlude. In 1610, he returned to the court, probably because he was short of money, and continued in the employ of the Shah until his death.Titley, 114; Brend 165; Canby (2009), 36, 50 A series of drawings copying the miniatures attributed to the great 15th-century artist Behzad, which were in the library of the shrine at Ardabil, strongly suggest that Riza had visited the city, probably as part of the Shah's party and perhaps on his visits in 1618 or 1625.Canby (2009), 123, 179 About the time of his return to court service, there is a considerable change in his style. \\"The primary colours and virtuoso technique of his early portraits give way in the 1620s to darker, earthier colours and a coarser, heavier line. New subjects only partly compensate for this disappointing stylistic development\\".Grove He painted many older men, perhaps scholars, Sufi divines, or shepherds, as well as birds and Europeans, and in his last years sometimes satirized his subjects.Grove Sheila Canby's 1996 monograph accepts 128 miniatures and drawings as by Riza, or probably so, and lists as \\"Rejected\\" or \\"Uncertain Attributions\\" a further 109 that have been ascribed to him at some pointCanby (1996), Appendices I & III Today, his works can be found in Tehran in the Reza Abbasi Museum and in the library at the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul. They can also be found in several western museums, such as the Smithsonian, where the Freer Gallery of Art has an album of works by him and pupils,Titley, 114 the British Museum, Louvre and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ==Gallery== Riza-yi-Abbasi 009.jpgReclining woman, 1595 Reza Abbasi - Two Lovers (1630).jpg Two Lovers, 1630 Youth kneeling and holding out a wine-cup.jpgYouth kneeling and holding out a wine cup Georgian prince by Reza Abbasi.jpgPrince Muhammad-Beik of Georgia by Reza Abbasi, 1620 Reza abbasi miniature cupbearer.jpgCup-bearer.

The J-1 version was flown by Wrongway Corrigan who crossed the Atlantic after being refused permission. ==Design== The Robin, a workmanlike cabin monoplane, had a wooden wing and steel tubing fuselage. The cabin accommodated three persons; two passengers were seated side-by-side behind the pilot. Early Robins were distinguished by large flat fairings over the parallel diagonal wing bracing struts; the fairings were abandoned on later versions, having been found to be ineffective in creating lift. The original landing gear had bungee rubber cord shock absorbers, later replaced by an oleo-pneumatic system; a number of Robins had twin floats added. Variants of the Robin were fitted with engines which developed . ==Operational history== endurance flight 13-30 July 1929, at St. Louis, Missouri, flown by Dale Jackson and Forest O'Brine for 17 days, 12 hours, 17 minutes A single modified Robin (with a Warner R-420-1) was used by the United States Army Air Corps, and designated the XC-10. This aircraft was used in a test program for radio-controlled (and unmanned) flight. Cuba's national airline, Compa√±√≠a Nacional Cubana de Aviaci√≥n Curtiss, was founded in 1929 with the Curtiss-Wright company serving as its co-founder and major investor. The airline's first aircraft was a Curtiss Robin and it was flown on domestic routes as a mail and passenger transport. From September 1929 to May 1930 a Robin C-1 was used to deliver the McCook, Nebraska Daily Gazette to communities in rural Nebraska and Kansas. The airplane flew a nonstop route of daily, dropping bundles of newspapers from a height of to local carriers. A Curtiss Robin C was purchased by the Paraguayan government in 1932 for the transport squadron of its air arm.

The globe weighs approximately 5,600 pounds (2,500 kg), and has a diameter of over 41 feet (12.5 m). ==Construction== Eartha's mounting at the base using a cantilever arm with two motors. The globe was built with a scale of 1:1,000,000, on which one inch represents sixteen miles. As with most globes, it is mounted at a 23.5 degree angle, the same axial tilt as the Earth itself; thus the equator is diagonal to the floor. It uses a cantilever mount with two motors, and simulates one day's revolution and rotation every 18 minutes, though it is possible for the motors to fully rotate the globe in as little as one minute. The globe was completed on July 23, 1998, after two years of construction and planning, and it uses a composite database built from satellite imagery, shaded relief, colored bathymetry, and information about road networks and urban areas. The database used to generate the surface images was approximately 140 gigabytes. While former CEO of DeLorme Maps, David DeLorme, is credited with the design of the globe, Lewiston-based surveyor and civil engineer, Vincent J.P. Leblanc, was involved in the building project. Map technician Jeff Clark was \\"responsible\\" for each of the 792 plastic sections that cover the rotating globe. Eartha is contained in an atrium with several glass walls that allow it to be seen from outside of the building; it is readily visible from U.S. Route 1. At night, the globe is illuminated. Eartha is constructed around a truss structure which is called Omni-Span, and consists of over 6000 pieces of aluminum tubing. This is covered by a skin of 792 map panels, each covering 8 degrees of latitude and 10 degrees of longitude, and attached to the trusses with a custom-designed system of hidden bolts. ==Public viewing== The atrium containing Eartha is open to the public during business hours. There is an adjacent gift shop that carries various DeLorme and geography related products. The mounting equipment is in a large pit below floor level and is visible to visitors, but the stairway down is chained off to prevent public access. There are two balconies that allow visitors to more easily view the higher parts of the globe. Some offices within the building also have views overlooking Eartha. Eartha was originally designed to be in diameter. In 1999, surveyors hired by the Guinness Book of World Records measured the globe at ; while this is noted on the DeLorme web site (as of 2007-09-05), they also list the globe as in diameter. David DeLorme, CEO of the DeLorme mapping company, is credited with the design.

It also comes in green and gold varieties that sometimes are made to taste differently. It is used as a fruit punch concentrate and some claim that a red colored fruit syrup called fassionola was an ingredient in the original Hurricane cocktail. Although a frequent attribution, solid evidence of fassionola's use in the Hurricane from before 1956 is currently lacking, and it is not known what were the precise ingredients in the earliest version of fassionola. == Tiki drink usage == Claimed to have been first fashioned in 1916, the complete history of fassionola is unclear but is closely associated with Donn Beach (aka, Don the Beachcomber). Beach cites his childhood as growing up near New Orleans, and he sometimes used fassionola in making what came to be known as \\"tiki drinks\\" in his 1930s era bars. Some claim fassionola was invented by Beach. Others believe that is unclear. Regardless, the ingredient is listed as being used by Beach in the book Hawaii'i, Tropical Rum Drinks & Cuisine By Don The Beachcomber and calls for its use in some of Beach's more well known drinks such as the Cobra's Fang, Q.B. Cooler, Pi Yi, and Rum Barrel. The book also discusses the extent that Beach went to in order to keep his recipes a secret, premixing ingredients himself and relabeling bottles with only numbers and letters with recipes sometimes written in code. Trader Vic listed what he called \\"passionola\\" in the index of his 1972 revised Bartender's Guide. He described it as \\"a non-alcoholic syrup made from passion fruit [that] comes in three colors ‚Äî red, green, and natural\\". He did not however list it as an ingredient for any of the cocktails in his book. 21st century drink makers continue to use the ingredient in tiki cocktail recipes, where it is viewed by some as a \\"secret ingredient\\" and by others as a generic fruit punch concentrate. ==Manufactured brands == A common and the attributed original mass manufactured brand is Jonathan English's Brand Red Tropical Gold Fruit Mix, produced and distributed by the Jonathan English Company in San Diego since the 1950s. Cocktail & Sons is another brand among others. == See also == *falernum syrup *orgeat syrup *Passion fruit-Orange-Guava (POG) juice == References == Category:Drink mixers Category:Syrup ","title":"Fassionola"},{"id":"1271114","text":"Vilson Ahmeti (born 5 September 1951 in Fier) is an Albanian political figure.

He arose on a political scene where one's power was dictated by what region of Dahomey one lived in. He served as president of the National Assembly of Dahomey from April 1959 to November 1960https://assemblee-nationale.bj/wp- content/uploads/2017/10/Histoire-et-patrimoine.pdf and as prime minister of Dahomey from 1964 to 1965. Ahomad√©gb√© became President as part of a system that rotated the office between three leading political figures: Ahomad√©gb√©, Hubert Maga, and Sourou-Migan Apithy. Maga peacefully handed power to Ahomad√©gb√© on May 7, 1972. On October 26, 1972, he was overthrown in a coup d'√©tat led by Mathieu K√©r√©kou. All three remained under house arrest until 1981. ==Early life and entry into politics== Location of Abomey in Benin Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin was born on January 16, 1917, a direct descendant of the kings of Abomey, the town of his birth. He attended the √âcole William Ponty and the French West Africa School of Medicine in Dakar. He served in the French Army for a short while, where he attained the rank of sergeant. After his short military career, Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin decided to pursue dentistry, opening an office in Porto-Novo.. Originally a member of the Dahomeyan Progressive Union (UPD), in 1946 he established the African People's Bloc (BPA), and was elected to the General Council shortly afterwards. He was re- elected in 1952. In 1955 the BPA merged with the UPD to established the Dahomeyan Democratic Union (UDD). He was a vocal critic of the French rule, and gained influence upon allying himself with trade unions. Using this, Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin was elected Mayor of Abomey in November 1956 elections.. The results of the territorial elections of 1959 were as such: the Republican Party of Dahomey (PRD), led by Sourou-Migan Apithy received 37 seats with 144,038 votes; the Dahomeyan Democratic Rally (RDD), led by Hubert Maga received 22 seats with 62,132 votes; and Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin's UDD receiving just 11 deputies for its 162,179 votes. What followed was described by journalist Robert Matthews as \\"an immediate explosion\\". Supporters of Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin started riots that were so severe that French soldiers were called in to quell them. Apithy and Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin agreed to split the contested 18 seats in a southwest constituency among themselves as a result of a mediation performed by F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny.. However, Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin made it clear that he would not allow Apithy to remain the Prime Minister of Dahomey, but Apithy was not going to listen to his demands. Maga was chosen as a compromise for the premiership and was voted into this post on May 22, 1959.. ==Independence and dissent== Ahomadegbe-Tometin with Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol, 1964 On August 1, 1960 Dahomey gained its independence and Maga became its first president. Shortly after independence, the three parties united into the \\"Patriotic Action Front\\" and redistricted Dahomey into one electoral constituency. Under this system, they would provide a list of candidates of whom whoever received a majority would win all legislative seats. It did not last long; soon, Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin broke from the union and, using the discontent among people over the increasing rarity of jobs in the country, incited demonstrations. In September 1960 he claimed that a single-party state was the only solution to the stagnation of the economy; since he had just broken from one, he was looking for another party to be led by him.. Meanwhile, Maga made Houphou√´t-Boigny recognise the RDD as the Dahomeyan wing of his African Democratic Rally. Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin had always believed that the UDD was the sole representative of the Rally. At the end of September Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin convinced the trade unions that he owned to begin another strike for Maga's inability to promote national development and ensure the welfare of the working class. The strike, which existed in Dahomey's capital of Porto-Novo and its largest city of Cotonou, became so serious that police forces used tear gas and ended when Maga sent down some faithful Northerners, carrying around bows and arrows and patrolling the streets at night. At the same time members of the UDD organised a motion of censure in the National Assembly. Maga relied on Apithy for help in opposing the motion, and it was ultimately rejected.. Right after the motion was rejected, UDD deputies began quitting their jobs. They were in turn replaced by deputies of the PRD Shortly after this the PRD and RDD merged to form the Dahomeyan Unity Party (PDU) and Maga was naturally elected its leader. On December 11, Maga was formally elected president and Apithy vice president. In the parliamentary elections the PDU received 69% of the vote and UDD 31%, although it was not represented in the National Assembly.. ==Maga assassination plot== On May 26 Information Minister Albert T√©vo√©djr√® notified Maga that Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin had plotted to assassinate the president but he and 11 other dissidents had been arrested. The trial date was set for December. It differed from many political trials in Africa being that it was held in public and the defence was allowed a lawyer from Paris. In any event, Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin received five years for his role in the conspiracy, and the others were dealt from one- to ten-year sentences.. The UDD was also banned. Maga ultimately released them in November 1962, saying in a broadcastIt is unclear what type of broadcast this was. that it was not only due to their good behavior in jail but also to reconcile with his former enemies.. ==Presidential council== ===Background and 1970 election=== On December 10, 1969, √âmile Derlin Zinsou was overthrown by Maurice Kouand√©t√©, who had installed him as president in the first place. The military, however, refused to recognize Kouand√©t√©,. and as the two men could not reach agreement, a Military Directorate was established with Paul-√âmile de Souza as its chairman.. An election was held on March 28, 1970 to determine the true president. On this occasion, the triumvirate was allowed to campaign, and they did not miss the chance. Intimidation and bribery were commonplace, and the electoral campaign saw the comeback of regional loyalties.. It was also marked by a series of violent outbursts; invalidated reports state that six people were killed or wounded at incidents in Parakou on the eve of the elections. Fellow candidate Zinsou asserted that Maga supporters had killed one of his supporters during said incidents.. These charges did not affect Maga's standing in the polls; he received a majority of the vote in the north, and Apithy and Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin received a majority in the southeast and southwest/central, respectively. The election results were as follows: 252,551 citizens voted for Maga; 200,091 for Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin, and 186,332 for Apithy.. In the entire south, Maga received 24,000 votes compared to the 180,000 who voted for him in the Borgou Department, obtaining 97.3 percent of the 78 percent turnout.. Zinsou, running to counter the constant tribal clashes, received 3 percent,. with 17,551 votes. Nonetheless, de Souza decided to nullify the results from Atakora, the region where Maga received the most votes, on April 3.. Outraged, Maga formed the Assembly of the Peoples of the North, which threatened to secede unless he was declared President.. He refused to leave his campaign headquarters at Parakou even to attend political meetings. Maga's reaction to the nullification prompted many southern workers to flee the north. Apithy stated that he would convince his region to join Nigeria if Maga took the presidency and took steps to bribe his way into that office. Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin claimed Maga had defrauded the electoral system to his advantage. In contrast with the other three former presidents, Zinsou admitted that he had been defeated and decided participate in bargaining,. explaining that he rejected the idea of a coalition \\"for personal reasons\\".. The other former Presidents, on the other hand, agreed to a hasty compromise on April 13 to prevent a civil war. ===Under Maga=== A presidential council, consisting of Maga, Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin, and Apithy, was set up on May 7 with a presidency that changed every two years. Maga inaugurated this system for the first two years.. Each man agreed to not use the military to extend their term or use any other means toward that consequence. If decisions were not unanimous during the first round of voting, a two councilman majority would suffice on the second round. The council served as the executive and legislative branch of Dahomey. The cabinet was composed of four Ahomad√©gb√©- Tom√™tin allies, three Maga allies, and three allies of Apithy. Gabriel Loz√®s, appointed minister of finance; Theophile Paoletti, new minister of information and tourism; Edmond Doussou-Yovo, minister of education; and Karl Ahouansou, minister of communication, were all friends of Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin. Maga's colleagues in the cabinet were Pascal Chabi Kao, minister of finance; Albert Ouassa, minister of health; and Chabi Mama, minister of rural development; while Apithy friends were Ambroise Agboton, minister of labor; Joseph Keke, minister of economy and planning; and Michel Toko, minister of justice and guardian of the seals. Dauda Badaru, who had served as foreign minister under Zinsou, was allowed to keep his job.. Maga's economic policies during his chairmanship helped quiet union leaders whose protests during his presidency had been intense.. He helped create a tax plan that would finance their salaries by cutting expenditures and cracking down on tax evasion. In 1970 Dahomey witnessed a surplus of 429 million CFA francs, rising to a 570 million CFA franc surplus the following year. With the national economy in a favorable position, Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin and the rest of the council could afford a number of luxuries, including three houses and three Mercedes-Benz 300 automobiles to be shared amongst themselves, and festivals for the anniversary of the founding of the triumvirate. Togolese president Etienne Eyadema, who would later change his name to Gnassingb√© Eyad√©ma. His decision to extradite opposition leader Noe Kutuklui, and the Presidential Council's agreement, helped to undermine its popularity. The Council lost popularity with the Kutuklui Affair.. By decree of Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin and the rest of the council, Togolese opposition leader Noe Kutuklui was officially expelled from Dahomey on October 27, 1971,. where he had been practicing law since the late 1960s. It was at the request of General √âtienne Eyad√©ma, president of Togo, as Kutuklui had been involved in several plots against Eyadema's military government. The Council's decision to extradite him spurred demonstrations in Cotonou. Maga was unable to carry out his decision; Alphonse Alley protected Kutuklui and took him to an unknown place outside of Dahomey. Col. Alley received no punishment whatsoever for his role in the Affair. Students were some of those involved in the protests, and they soon had another reason to conflict with their government. On November 5, 1971, Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin and his administration shut down the Union G√©n√©ral des Etudiants et Eleves de Dahomey (UGEED), a radical youth group which sought to \\"transform Dahomey into a battlefield\\" using \\"workers, soldiers, and policemen\\". This stemmed from UGEED-sponsored demonstrations against the minister of education when he failed to attend an educational meeting. Students whose schools followed the strike were allowed back to school on November 19, and only if their parents signed documents that said they would not participate in more demonstrations. If they failed to comply, they would be expelled from the educational system of Dahomey. Government-instituted rallies were arranged to support the ban.. The military was also aroused. The formation of a presidential council only further enraged the army. Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin was ambushed while traveling to a rally in Abomey on May 7, 1971. Maga initially denied its existence, and to this day details are unclear. An artillery camp at Ouidah was the location of another military uprising on January 28, 1972. The president sent two officers to overpower the rebels although no punishment was undertaken.. Both Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin and Maga believed that the latter incident was an attempted coup.. Kouand√©t√© attempted to usurp power again at dawn on February 23. When he first heard of the mutiny, Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin believed that it was an attempt by Maga to remain in power. Leading the Ouidah garrison, Kouand√©t√© also attempted to take over government buildings and murder de Souza. Over the course of the operation, assailant Major Moumouni was mortally wounded by de Souza's bullets. The plot was foiled, although Maga canceled a visit to France to attend to the matter at hand.. A 12-member military commission would soon discover another plot, that would have been undertaken simultaneous to Kouand√©t√©'s. According to its findings, Captains Glele and Pierre Boni were going to follow Kouand√©t√© until de Souza was assassinated, when they would eradicate their leader and insert Zinsou back into power.. The recent events epitomised the Council's \\"fear and contempt\\" for the military.. ===Under Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin=== Maga transferred power to Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin on May 7, 1972. This was the first time in 12 years that the head of Dahomey was succeeded in a nonmilitary fashion. The new chairman congratulated Maga and praised the triumvirate as \\"one of Dahomey's most beneficial institutions.\\". It was believed that the triumvirate would continually undermine each other, and the simple transition of power was viewed as a positive step toward Dahomeyan unity. The Presidential Council was slow in organizing a military trial for the 1972 coup plotters, and it did not begin until May 12. The court tried 21 men besides Kouand√©t√©,The true number of accused men was not known until the trial was convened. mostly military officers but also including several commoners and even Maga bodyguards.. The punishments were announced on May 16. Kouand√©t√© received the death penalty, as did Captains Josu√© and Gl√©l√©, Quartermaster Sergeant Agboton, and a corporal and a sergeant in absentia. Lesser sentences were handed to five men who were given life imprisonment, two who would serve 20 years in prison, another with 15 years, two with ten, and two with five. An additional four were acquitted.. The sentences were never carried out; the jurors believed that Kouand√©t√© would seize power in another coup. Another delayed function of the Council was the formation of the Assembl√©e Consultative Nationale, an advisory assembly required by the 1970 constitution. As per the constitution, such an assembly would contain 30 members advising councilmen on economic, social, and other issues, with Paul Darboux presiding. It was not established until July 1972, due to, in the words of academic Samuel Decalo, \\"intensive horse-trading between the partners in the Presidential Council ... and pressures from their political lieutenants for a position in the Assembly.\\". One of the most notable aspects of Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin's time in power was the Kovacs Affair. It began with Pascal Chabi Kao being given a monopoly over selling official stationary to the Presidential Council and spread to claims of bribery and embezzlement. Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin tried to fire Chabi Kao, but Maga, who was Chabi Kao's mentor, refused. Maga convinced Apithy to help and the bill was vetoed.. Mathieu K√©r√©kou, who overthrew the Presidential Council in 1972, in a 2006 photograph Another coup was launched by soldiers of the Ouidah garrison on October 26. This one, however, was successful, and Major Mathieu K√©r√©kou was installed as president. It occurred during a cabinet meeting between Maga and Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin.Apithy was in Paris on a political trip.. K√©r√©kou had served as Maga's aide-de-camp in 1961.. According to reports at the scene, soldiers abruptly arrived in the Cabinet room of the presidential palace and started firing bullets,. but no one was injured. K√©r√©kou called the triumvirate \\"truly a monster\\" as it showed \\"unpardonable incompetence\\", amongst other charges which were used to justify the coup. Kouand√©t√© was pardoned, although the former council was not.. Maga, Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin, and Apithy spent more than nine years in prison before being freed by K√©r√©kou in 1981. ==Later life and death== After being released from incarceration, Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin was elected a Member of Parliament in 1991 under the National Rally for Democracy ticket and served at until 1995. He continued to lead the U.D.D. until his death on March 8, 2002, at the Hubert Maga National University and Hospital Center in Cotonou. No cause of death was given, although he was said to have suffered for a long time. The last of the triumvirate to die, he was awarded a state funeral and seven days of mourning, beginning on March 11. Flags were ordered to be flown at half-staff throughout the country during that period.. President Kerekou visited Ahomad√©gb√©- Tom√™tin's house shortly after his death, praising him as \\"a man of character, conviction, a fighter and a wise man\\".. The passing of Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin, which dominated newspapers in Dahomey, was received with more ambivalence than Kerekou's positive sentiments. Le Progres went so far as to say that Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin was \\"the monster of Abomey\\", and that he was \\"envied by his brothers due to his frankness and integrity ... Many of those now commending his patriotism, high morals and political exploits somehow killed him at one time or other.\\" Le Matinal wrote an article on the man, entitled \\"Message from beyond: Ahomadegbe challenges Kerekou\\", questioning why \\"the perpetrators of crimes [are] so indecent as to shed crocodile tears\\". More neutral was Fraternite, noting that \\"Ahomadegbe, whose political might was extraordinary, was among the most feared politicians in Benin's contemporary history. He was dangerous to have either as friend or foe. To him, politics was a winding sentence with several commas but no full stop.\\" baobab tree. Le Republicain compared his fall to that of a baobab tree, reflecting the mostly sad emotions that followed his departing. According to them, Ahomad√©gb√©-Tom√™tin \\"was among the three great thinkers who took turns to lead Dahomey (now Benin) from May 1970 to October 1972\\". A long prison sentence did not affect his inspiratory qualities. Les Echos du Jour stated that \\"the dental surgeon who became president fought to the end against life and its mishaps, then against death ... He resisted with all his might not to escape death, but merely to show that nothing was over until it was over.\\" In an obituary, Jeune Afrique described the man as \\"humor[ous], loved good cheer, knew how to enjoy the good side of life, but his blows of anger were Homeric\\". ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * . * . * . * . * . * . *. * . * . * . * . * .

In philosophical terms, these objects are ontologically independent of someone's conceptual scheme, perceptions, linguistic practices, beliefs, etc. Realism can be applied to many philosophically interesting objects and phenomena: other minds, the past or the future, universals, mathematical entities (such as natural numbers), moral categories, the physical world, and thought. Realism can also be a view about the nature of reality in general, where it claims that the world exists independent of the mind, as opposed to non-realist views (like some forms of skepticism and solipsism, which question our ability to assert the world is independent of our mind). Philosophers who profess realism often claim that truth consists in a correspondence between cognitive representations and reality.The statement veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus (\\"truth is the adequation of thought and thing\\") was defended by Thomas Aquinas. Realists tend to believe that whatever we believe now is only an approximation of reality but that the accuracy and fullness of understanding can be improved.Blackburn p. 188 In some contexts, realism is contrasted with idealism. Today it is more usually contrasted with anti- realism, for example in the philosophy of science. The oldest use of the term \\"realism\\" appears in medieval scholastic interpretations and adaptations of ancient Greek philosophy. ==Etymology== The term comes from Late Latin realis \\"real\\" and was first used in the abstract metaphysical sense by Immanuel Kant in 1781 (CPR A 369).Heidemann, D. \\"Kant and the forms of realism\\". Synthese (2019). ==Varieties== ===Metaphysical realism=== Metaphysical realism maintains that \\"whatever exists does so, and has the properties and relations it does, independently of deriving its existence or nature from being thought of or experienced.\\"Laird Addis, Greg Jesson, Erwin Tegtmeier (eds.), Ontology and Analysis: Essays and Recollections about Gustav Bergmann, Walter de Gruyter, 2007, p. 107. ===Naive or direct realism=== Naive realism, also known as direct realism, is a philosophy of mind rooted in a common sense theory of perception that claims that the senses provide us with direct awareness of the external world. In contrast, some forms of idealism assert that no world exists apart from mind-dependent ideas and some forms of skepticism say we cannot trust our senses. The naive realist view is that objects have properties, such as texture, smell, taste and colour, that are usually perceived absolutely correctly. We perceive them as they really are. ===Scientific realism=== Scientific realism is, at the most general level, the view that the world described by science is the real world, as it is, independent of what we might take it to be. Within philosophy of science, it is often framed as an answer to the question \\"how is the success of science to be explained?\\" The debate over what the success of science involves centers primarily on the status of unobservable entities apparently talked about by scientific theories. Generally, those who are scientific realists assert that one can make reliable claims about unobservables (viz., that they have the same ontological status) as observables. Analytic philosophers generally have a commitment to scientific realism, in the sense of regarding the scientific method as a reliable guide to the nature of reality. The main alternative to scientific realism is instrumentalism.Scientific Realism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) ====Scientific realism in physics==== Realism in physics (especially quantum mechanics) is the claim that the world is in some sense mind-independent: that even if the results of a possible measurement do not pre-exist the act of measurement, that does not require that they are the creation of the observer (contrary to the \\"consciousness causes collapse\\" interpretation of quantum mechanics). That interpretation of quantum mechanics, on the other hand, states that the wave function is already the full description of reality. The different possible realities described by the wave function are equally true. The observer collapses the wave function into their own reality. One's reality can be mind-dependent under this interpretation of quantum mechanics. ===Moral realism=== Moral realism is the position that ethical sentences express propositions that refer to objective features of the world. ===Aesthetic realism=== Aesthetic realism (not to be confused with Aesthetic Realism, the philosophy developed by Eli Siegel, or \\"realism\\" in the arts) is the view that there are mind-independent aesthetic facts.Nick Zangwill, The Metaphysics of Beauty, Cornell University Press, 2001, p. 3. ==History of metaphysical realism== ===Ancient Greek philosophy=== Plato (left) and Aristotle (right), a detail of The School of Athens, a fresco by Raphael. In Plato's metaphysics, ever unchanging Forms, or Ideas, exist apart from particular things, and are related to them as their prototype or exemplar. Aristotle's philosophy of reality also aims at the universal. Aristotle finds the universal, which he calls essence, in the commonalities of particular things. In ancient Greek philosophy, realist doctrines about universals were proposed by Plato and Aristotle.Realism ‚Äì philosophy ‚Äì Britannica.com Platonic realism is realism regarding the existence of universals or abstract objects. As universals were considered by Plato to be ideal forms, this stance is confusingly also called Platonic idealism. This should not be confused with Idealism, as presented by philosophers such as George Berkeley: as Platonic abstractions are not spatial, temporal, or mental, they are not compatible with the latter Idealism's emphasis on mental existence. Plato's Forms include numbers and geometrical figures, making them a theory of mathematical realism; they also include the Form of the Good, making them in addition a theory of ethical realism. Aristotelian realism is the view that the existence of universals is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them. ===Medieval philosophy=== Medieval realism developed out of debates over the problem of universals.John Marenbon, Medieval Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 72. Universals are terms or properties that can be applied to many things, such as \\"red\\", \\"beauty\\", \\"five\\", or \\"dog\\". Realism (also known as exaggerated realism) in this context, contrasted with conceptualism and nominalism, holds that such universals really exist, independently and somehow prior to the world. Moderate realism holds that they exist, but only insofar as they are instantiated in specific things; they do not exist separately from the specific thing. Conceptualism holds that they exist, but only in the mind, while nominalism holds that universals do not \\"exist\\" at all but are no more than words (flatus vocis) that describe specific objects. Proponents of moderate realism included Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, and Duns Scotus (cf. Scotist realism).Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism ‚Äì Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) ===Early modern philosophy=== In early modern philosophy, Scottish Common Sense Realism was a school of philosophy that sought to defend naive realism against philosophical paradox and scepticism, arguing that matters of common sense are within the reach of common understanding and that common- sense beliefs even govern the lives and thoughts of those who hold non- commonsensical beliefs. It originated in the ideas of the most prominent members of the Scottish School of Common Sense, Thomas Reid, Adam Ferguson and Dugald Stewart, during the 18th century Scottish Enlightenment and flourished in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in Scotland and America. The roots of Scottish Common Sense Realism can be found in responses to such philosophers as John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume. The approach was a response to the \\"ideal system\\" that began with Descartes' concept of the limitations of sense experience and led Locke and Hume to a skepticism that called religion and the evidence of the senses equally into question. The common sense realists found skepticism to be absurd and so contrary to common experience that it had to be rejected. They taught that ordinary experiences provide intuitively certain assurance of the existence of the self, of real objects that could be seen and felt and of certain \\"first principles\\" upon which sound morality and religious beliefs could be established. Its basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:Cuneo and Woudenberg, eds. The Cambridge companion to Thomas Reid (2004) p 85 :If there are certain principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity to take for granted in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them‚Äîthese are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd. ===Late modern philosophy=== In late modern philosophy, a notable school of thought advocating metaphysical realism was Austrian realism. Its members included Franz Brentano, Alexius Meinong, Vittorio Benussi, Ernst Mally,Liliana Albertazzi, Dale Jacquette, The School of Alexius Meinong, Routledge, 2017, p. 191. and early Edmund Husserl.Gestalt Theory: Official Journal of the Society for Gestalt Theory and Its Applications (GTA), 22, Steinkopff, 2000, p. 94: \\"Attention has varied between Continental Phenomenology (late Husserl, Merleau-Ponty) and Austrian Realism (Brentano, Meinong, Benussi, early Husserl)\\". These thinkers stressed the objectivity of truth and its independence of the nature of those who judge it.Mark Textor, The Austrian Contribution to Analytic Philosophy, Routledge, 2006, pp. 170‚Äì1: \\"[Husserl argues in the Logical Investigations that the rightness of a judgement or proposition] shows itself in our experience of self-evidence (Evidenz), which term Husserl takes from Brentano, but makes criterial not of truth per se but of our most secure awareness that things are as we take them to be, when the object of judgement, the state of affairs, is given most fully or adequately. ... In his struggle to overcome relativism, especially psychologism, Husserl stressed the objectivity of truth and its independence of the nature of those who judge it ... A proposition is true not because of some fact about a thinker but because of an objectively existing abstract proposition's relation to something that is not a proposition, namely a state of affairs.\\" (See also Graz School.) Dialectical materialism, a philosophy of nature based on the writings of late modern philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, is interpreted to be a form of ontological realism.Sean Creaven, Marxism and Realism: A Materialistic Application of Realism in the Social Sciences, Routledge, 2012, p. 33. According to Michael Resnik, Gottlob Frege's work after 1891 can be interpreted as a contribution to realism.Michael Resnik, \\"II. Frege as Idealist and then Realist,\\" Inquiry 22 (1‚Äì4):350‚Äì357 (1979). ===Contemporary philosophy=== In contemporary analytic philosophy, Bertrand Russell,Bertrand Russell, Philosophy of Logical Atomism, Open Court, 1998 [1918].

It is on the west bank of the Hutt River, on State Highway 2, the Wellington-Hutt main road, and directly across the river from the centre of Lower Hutt. It is also the name of the three-lane bridge connecting the Hutt City central business district with State Highway 2, a route subject to extensive congestion at peak times. From the Melling Bridge it is possible to drive straight ahead into the hill suburbs of Harbour View and Tirohanga. Improved interchanges are planned for the Melling and Kennedy- Good bridges. ==History== Melling was named after Tom Mellings, a former Lancashire workmate of Richard Seddon. The name came about after then-Premier Seddon revisited England and reunited with Mellings in 1897. Mellings had never visited New Zealand, and the local settlers intended to change the name to one of greater significance. The original Melling railway station opened on 26 May 1908, Hoy, D.G.

Finally Galindo made his debut with the first team in the 2002 spring season, and was a solid starter by the 2003 Clausura season. Galindo was a member of the Mexico national team, and has played for numerous Mexico youth teams; a starter for the U-23 team at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Two games into the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, Galindo along with teammate (of both club and country) Salvador Carmona were separated from the rest of the national team staying in G√∂ttingen, Germany. Initially disciplinary problems was the explanation given by the Mexico federation for the separation, the federation later confirmed both players tested positive for performance enhancement drugs. Both men received a one-year ban from competition, which barred Galindo from playing in the 2005 Apertura, 2006 Clausura seasons, and the 2006 FIFA World Cup. ===H√©rcules CF=== Galindo signed in the summer of 2006 with H√©rcules CF of the Spanish second division. Despite being considered a major signing by the club he played very few games and was on the bench for most of the season. ===Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich=== Galindo signed a contract with Swiss team Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich in February 2007. Galindo capped his first goal with Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich and in the Swiss Super League on 17 February 2007 against FC Thun. He scored the first goal in the match for Grasshoppers in the 49th minute. The goal came after teammate Diego Le√≥n's pass to Sreto Ristiƒá, who in turn gave a through pass to Galindo. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Galindo's shot ended up in Thun's nets. His first goal contributed to Grasshoppers' 2‚Äì0 win over Thun. ===Eintracht Frankfurt=== On 28 July 2007, it was announced that Galindo had signed a two-year contract at the German club Eintracht Frankfurt. ===Guadalajara=== On 8 January 2009, Galindo left Frankfurt to return to his native Mexico to play for Club Deportivo Guadalajara to sign a four-year contract. On 28 February 2009, Galindo scored his first goal with Chivas de Guadalajara in a 5‚Äì0 win over C.F. Pachuca in the Jalisco Stadium. ===Santos Laguna=== On 7 June 2011, Galindo signed with Santos Laguna. ===Toluca=== After seeing less action on the pitch with Santos Laguna he was loaned to Deportivo Toluca on 8 July 2013, where he competes for the starting line up with Paulo Da Silva, Edgar Due√±as and Francisco Gamboa. ===Toledo=== On 1 September 2017, Galindo returned to Spain after agreeing to a contract with CD Toledo. ==Career statistics== ===International=== { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" - !colspan=\\"7\\"International appearances - ! # !!

The film's theme song, \\"Colors of the Wind\\" was originally recorded by American singer and actress Judy Kuhn in her role as the singing voice of Pocahontas. A pop ballad, the song's lyrics are about animism and respecting nature, and have been compared to both transcendentalist literature and New Age spirituality. \\"Colors of the Wind\\" received a mostly positive reception from critics, with a number of them citing it as one of the best songs from a Disney film. The song would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song, the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. American actress and recording artist Vanessa Williams's adult contemporary cover of the song was released as the lead single from the film's soundtrack, and became a top ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100. \\"Colors of the Wind\\" would also be covered by other artists, including Ashanti and Brian Wilson, and was featured on an episode of Lip Sync Battle. ==Background== The song was inspired by the words of Chief Seattle. Following the death of Howard Ashman, the Walt Disney Company wanted to find another musician to collaborate with Alan Menken on his scores for animated films. Stephen Schwartz, the composer behind the Broadway theater hits Godspell (1971), Pippin (1972), and The Magic Show (1974), received a call from the company asking if he would like to collaborate with Menken. Schwartz had never considered working in the film industry, but agreed to do so nonetheless. Schwartz did not feel he was well-suited to the job. Schwartz wanted to write a song for the film wherein Pocahontas confronts the Eurocentrism of John Smith. \\"Colors of the Wind\\" was the first song written for Pocahontas. According to Schwartz, the song \\"influence[d] the development of the rest of the film.\\" Schwartz said that \\"a story-board outline was in place before we wrote [the track]. This is often the process in animation, at least as I've experienced it, where everybody works from an outline and each succeeding piece of material, whether it is a song or drawings, influences the next.\\" The track was inspired by Native American poetry, music and folklore, as well as a famous letter sent to the United States Congress by Chief Seattle regarding humanity's relationship with nature. Part of the letter reads: \\"The wind that gave our grandfather his first breath also received his last sigh. The wind also gives our children the spirit of life. So if we sell our land, you must keep it apart and sacred, as a place where man can go to taste the wind that is sweetened by the meadow flowers.\\" This portion of the letter inspired the song's title, which Schwartz liked because he saw it as paradoxical and thought-provoking. Schwartz also drew inspiration for \\"Colors of the Wind\\" from the music of Oscar Hammerstein II and Sheldon Harnick, as it deals with issues of prejudice. Menken said that while \\"Colors of the Wind\\" was \\"born out of the modality of Native American music...it quickly moved to its own place, which is hard to define.\\" Menken has noted that the song lacks humor, which he and Schwartz attempted to inject into Pocahontas and failed. Initially, the final lines of the song were \\"For your life's an empty hull/till you get it through your skull/you can paint with all the colors of the wind.\\" Menken disapproved of these lyrics and asked Schwartz to rewrite them; Schwartz changed the lines to \\"You can own the Earth, and still/all you'll own is earth until/you can paint with all the colors of the wind.\\" Schwartz preferred the altered lyrics. Schwartz said that this incident taught him the lesson: \\"If your collaborator is unhappy, it's probably because [the song] needs to be better,\\" adding that he may not have won an Academy Award if he did not change the lyrics. Menken views \\"Colors of the Wind\\" as one of the most important songs he has written. Schwartz believed that the Walt Disney Company would reject \\"Colors of the Wind\\" for being philosophical and different from previous Disney songs. Judy Kuhn sang the song to help \\"pitch\\" Schwartz's score to Disney, and the studio embraced the track. Schwartz and Menken became friends, and later wrote music for the Disney films The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996) and Enchanted (2007) together. ==Composition and lyrics== A thirty-second sample of \\"Colors of the Wind\\", a pop ballad. \\"Colors of the Wind\\" is a pop ballad written by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz and performed by Judy Kuhn. It has a length of three minutes and thirty-four seconds. According to the Orlando Sentinel, the song does not resemble Native American music. The song is about animism and having respect for nature. It features lyrics about \\"painting with all the colors of the wind\\" and listening to \\"the voices of the mountains sing.\\" Madhurya Gajula of The Odyssey Online opined that the song's lyrics about nature's interconnectivity bears similarity to transcendentalism, specifically the philosophy of Henry David Thoreau; similarly, Justyna Fruzi≈Ñska wrote in Emerson Goes to the Movies: Individualism in Walt Disney Company's Post-1989 Animated Films that the lyrics of \\"Colors of the Wind\\" are reminiscent of the writings of transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson and New Age spirituality. The staff of Billboard likened the lyrics of \\"Colors of the Wind\\" to a public service announcement about embracing diversity. Sonically, Rita Kempley of The Washington Post found \\"Colors of the Wind\\" akin to music from Busby Berkeley films and The Little Mermaid (1989).Kempley, Rita. \\"‚ÄòPocahontas‚Äô: A Hit or Myth Proposition\\" The Washington Post. June 23, 1995 The song also features a mention of a \\"blue corn moon\\"; there is no such thing according to Charisse. Responding to a fan inquiry, Schwartz admitted that he coined the phrase after reading a Native American love poem which read: \\"I will come to you in the moon of green corn\\"; Native Americans referred to months as \\"moons\\" and named them after events that happened seasonally, such as the sprouting of green corn. Schwartz disliked the phrase \\"green corn moon\\" due to the sound of the word \\"green\\" and because he felt it might evoke the urban legend that the Moon is made of green cheese. Instead, Schwartz used the phrase \\"blue corn moon\\" as it reminded him of both blue moons and blue corn tortillas. Schwartz thought that the phrase might evoke the Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands rather than the Algonquin people depicted in Pocahontas, but was satisfied with it anyway. == International versions == German voice-actress and singer and the German cast of Pocahontas were awarded best foreign dubbing worldwide On its theater release in 1995, the movie numbered 28 dubbings worldwide, to which 9 more were added in the following years, raising the number of official versions to 37. The 10th anniversary edition DVD release of the movie features a multi-language clip reel presenting the song \\"Colors of the Wind\\" in 11 of the 28 versions originally released for the movie, with an introduction by director Mike Gabriel.

Jordan Appugliesi of Mic ranked it the sixth best song from a Disney soundtrack, saying that it is \\"a poignant, memorable ballad\\" in the vein of \\"Reflection\\" from Mulan (1998). Rita Kempler of The Washington Post felt that the \\"stirring anthem\\" is the song from Pocahontas which \\"comes closest to a show-stopper.\\" The staff of Billboard called the song \\"artistic\\" and \\"wistful\\" and ranked it the ninth best song of the Disney Renaissance. Writing for The Austin Chronicle, Hollis Chacona opined \\"Unlike so many film composers of late, Menken knows when to keep quiet and when to let loose his powerful score. That power soars through its centerpiece (and no doubt Oscar- bound) song, 'Colors of the Wind,' performed by Judy Kuhn.\\" Dorkys Ramos of Time Out said that the song and \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" from Pinocchio (1940) are \\"at the top of our list when it comes to songs we don't tire of hearing again and again.\\" Spin Andrew Unterberger criticized the track's \\"patronizing\\" portrayal of Native American beliefs, but said that \\"man...Judy Kuhn's voice soars, with those little trills and sweeping highs. It makes it much easier to get behind what's ultimately an agreeable message of environmental awareness and acceptance.\\" Aylin Zafar of BuzzFeed ranked \\"Colors of the Wind\\" the ninth best Disney song, commending it for \\"encourag[ing] people to appreciate the world around them and to seek to understand others before judging them.\\" Gregory E. Miller of the New York Post deemed it one of Disney's best songs and an \\"iconic hit\\" which is \\"flashier\\" than another song from Pocahontas, \\"Just Around the Riverbend\\". Screen Rant's Turner Minton viewed \\"Colors of the Wind\\" as the tenth best Disney song and \\"an anthem about the harmonious nature of the shared world which embraces all races of people.\\" Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times viewed \\"Colors of the Wind\\" and \\"When She Loved Me\\" from Toy Story 2 (1999) as the only Disney songs released since Howard Ashman's death which \\"approached the standards\\" of the music from Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992). The staff of People said that the track is \\"performed effectively within the body of the film by Kuhn\\". CollegeHumor's Willie Muse wrote that \\"even though Pocahontas as a whole is completely forgettable, I guarantee everyone reading this knows every single lyric of [\\"Colors of the Wind\\"]. Beautiful to listen to and epic in its scope, 'Colors of the Wind' transcends the movie that birthed it to earn its place as an undeniable classic.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times deemed the song \\"heartfelt\\" but less catchy than previous Disney songs. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly stated that Pocahontas \\"Alan Menken-Stephen Schwartz songs have all the flavor of uncooked dough\\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone criticized the song for its \\"political correctness\\" and for \\"sermoniz[ing] about ecology by using pedestrian conceits\\". The track won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media. ==Cover versions and usage in media== ===Vanessa Williams version=== ====Background and composition==== Vanessa Williams was chosen to perform \\"Colors of the Wind\\" due to the success of her Grammy Award-nominated single \\"Save the Best for Last\\". Williams' cover is an adult contemporary pop song which omits the opening lyrics of the original version of the track. The cover features Bill Miller playing the Native American flute. Scott Mendelson of Forbes wrote \\"The practice of having what amounts to a radio-friendly pop version of a given Disney song for a new Disney movie is of course an old tradition going back at least to\\" Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson's cover of the title track of Beauty and the Beast (1991); Mendelson noted that this practice was continued with Williams' version of \\"Colors of the Wind\\" and Demi Lovato's rendition of \\"Let It Go\\" from Frozen (2013). According to Mendelson, Williams' cover \\"was considered an 'all is forgiven' note\\" following the removal of her Miss America title. ====Credits and personnel==== * Vanessa Williams: lead vocals * Alan Menken: composer * Stephen Schwartz: lyricist * Robbie Buchanan: arranger, keyboards * Keith Thomas: producer, arranger, additional keyboards, synthesizers, drum programming, bass synth * Mark Hammond: drum programming * Dann Huff: guitars * Bill Miller: flute * Ronn Huff: orchestra arrangements * The Nashville String Machine: orchestra ====Critical reception==== Raisa Bruner of Time said that Williams' rendition was \\"performed flawlessly\\", adding that \\"The powerful Pocahontas song finds the crystal-clear voice of Vanessa Williams painting a vision of 17th-century Native American life‚Äîand the importance of the environment‚Äîthat still resonates with audiences today.\\" Bruner said that the cover stood alongside Elton John's version of \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\" from The Lion King (1994) as one of \\"the best radio- ready versions of Disney's finest melodies\\". MTV's Jessica Norton felt that the cover is \\"even more magical\\" than the original and \\"fitting...for free- spirited 'Nessa to cover.\\" The staff of People opined that the song is \\"not well served by the former Miss America‚Äôs pop diva turn. Indeed, her overblown interpretation seems directly at odds with the song‚Äôs message. Stay tuned to Kuhn.\\" ===Other covers=== The album Disneymania (2002) includes Ashanti's version of \\"Colors of the Wind\\". Actress Christy Carlson Romano covered the song for her debut EP Greatest Disney TV & Film Hits (2004). Actress and singer Vanessa Hudgens covered the song for Disneymania 5 (2007). Brian Wilson released a funk-influenced version of \\"Colors of the Wind\\" on his album In the Key of Disney (2011). American singer Tori Kelly's rendition of the song was included on the album We Love Disney (2015). Kelly decided to cover the song because she was obsessed with Pocahontas as a child. The Chipettes covered the song for the 1995 album When You Wish Upon a Chipmunk. Australian soprano Mirusia Louwerse covered \\"Colors of the Wind\\" for This Time Tomorrow (2016), her fourth solo album. The singer's arrangement has been described as featuring \\"a simple and unobtrusive accompaniment on acoustic guitar.\\" Postmodern Jukebox, a musical collective that creates vintage-style covers of popular songs, released a cover of the song in the style of 1970s soul music. ===Usage in media=== Actress Melissa McCarthy lip synced the song during an episode of Lip Sync Battle. Before lip syncing the track, McCarthy donned protective goggles. Then a high-powered wind machine blew water, stuffed animals, confetti, streamers and fake leaves at her as the song played. The performance received a standing ovation, and Jimmy Fallon deemed her the winner of the battle. ==Charts and certifications== ===Vanessa Williams version=== ====Weekly charts==== {class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" - !Chart (1995) !Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\"Australia (ARIA)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"16 - !scope=\\"row\\"Ireland (IRMA)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"16 - !scope=\\"row\\"New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"25 - !scope=\\"row\\"UK Singles (Official Charts Company)  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"21 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Billboard Hot 100  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"4 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks (Billboard)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks (Billboard)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"10 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Hot R&B;/Hip- Hop Songs (Billboard)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"53 - !Chart (1996) !Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\"Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders)  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"38 - !scope=\\"row\\"Netherlands (Dutch Top 40)  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"8 } ====Year-end charts==== { class=\\" plainrowheaders unsortable\\" - !Chart (1995) !Position - !scope=\\"row\\"US Billboard Hot 100  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"31 } ====Certifications==== ===Judy Kuhn version=== ====Certifications==== ==References== ==Bibliography== * * ==External links== * (on Disney's official channel) Category:1995 songs Category:1995 singles Category:Songs from Pocahontas (1995 film) Category:Environmental songs Category:Best Original Song Golden Globe winning songs Category:Best Original Song Academy Award-winning songs Category:Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media Category:Walt Disney Records singles Category:Mercury Records singles Category:Pop ballads Category:Disney Renaissance songs Category:Songs with music by Alan Menken Category:Songs written by Stephen Schwartz (composer) Category:Vanessa Williams songs Category:1990s ballads Category:Songs against racism and xenophobia Category:Brian Wilson songs Category:Pam Tillis songs Category:Tori Kelly songs Category:Ashanti (singer) songs ","title":"Colors of the Wind"},{"id":"1271142","text":"Emil.RuleZ! is a Hungarian pop and alternative jazz band.

MRAP began funded projects of direct action with community organizations in 1997 after several months of collaborative planning with the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute's Empowerment and Change Project (MLRI). MRAP's primary focus of its work is with non-profit organizations in New England. However, MRAP also collaborates with two national organizations offering technical assistance, training, and support for the development of public policy to community organizations and groups around the country. These organizations, the Preamble Center and Grassroots Policy Project of New York City and Washington D.C. share MRAP's vision of providing strategic development training to community organizations. MRAP's vision includes the development of a national media resource network (the Community Media and Internet Resource Network) which includes internet and organizational links to other media research centers on the country. ==External links== *MRAP website Media Research and Action Project Category:Organizations based in Boston Category:Organizations established in 1986 ","title":"Boston College Media Research and Action Project"},{"id":"1271175","text":"John Fellows Akers (December 28, 1934 ‚Äì August 22, 2014) was an American businessman. He was president (1983-1989), chief executive officer (1985-1993) and chairman (1986-1993) of International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). ==Education== Akers attended Yale, and while there became a brother of Delta Kappa Epsilon (Phi chapter). ==Business career== ===IBM=== Akers joined IBM in 1960 after serving in the Navy as a jet pilot.https://www.ibm.com/ibm/us/en/john_akers.html Akers said in 2010 ‚ÄúWe were very square. We wore the blue suits, white shirts with button-down collars, striped ties, fedoras and wingtip shoes.

In 1989, a young Sam Palmisano was appointed as Aker's assistant; decades later Palmisano would serve as chairman and CEO. ===Actions as CEO=== Akers was credited with simplifying the company's bureaucracy to focus more on profits. On January 29, 1988, in a sweeping restructuring intended to reverse three years of disappointing performance, Akers created five new, highly autonomous organizations responsible for all of the company's innovation, design, and manufacturing. The moves were intended to greatly decentralize the company, which had been seen as bloated and unable to keep up with the competition and give significantly more responsibility to a younger generation of managers, while significantly reducing the role of the company's Armonk, N.Y., headquarters in the day-to-day operations. Under the plan, thousands of employees had to switch jobs or find themselves working for new managers. Akers' vision was to autonomize each division into \\"Baby Blues\\" with the aim of spinning them off from \\"Big Blue\\". Akers also presided over a major downsizing of IBM's workforce, cutting down from 407,000 to 360,000 by the end of 1991. The company had previously had a lifetime employment policy but successive voluntary buyouts and the first-ever layoff in March 1993, caused a morale crisis. Akers also closed ten plants and trimmed manufacturing capacity by forty percent. ===Resignation=== On Tuesday, January 26, 1993, Akers was forced to announce his resignation, after several months of IBM insisting that it had full confidence in his leadership. The company had posted a $5 billion annual loss. The dividend was also slashed from $1.21 to 54 cents, after the company had failed to make enough profit to cover its dividend payments for eight business quarters. IBM president Jack Kuehler was shifted to the post of vice-chairman, while finance director Frank Metz was also ousted. Paul Rizzo, a rival with Akers for the CEO position back in 1985 who had retired in 1987 was restored to the post of vice-chairman and appointed finance director. Akers remained as chief executive for three months while a committee of directors chose a successor, long speculated to be an outsider. The management coup was mounted by longtime IBM director Jim Burke , who organized secret meetings between Rizzo and outsider Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. to examine the company's problems. It was also speculated that several entities were dissatisfied with losing their power on the board of directors and the declining stock price, including the banks which were once IBM's largest shareholders, as well as Aker's predecessors as CEO, John Opel and Frank Cary. Akers retired as chairman and CEO of IBM on April 1, 1993. He was succeeded in both positions by Gerstner, the first CEO in IBM's history to attain the position from outside the company. ===Legacy=== Akers was chief executive during IBM's decline in the mid-1980s and early 1990s. Apple Inc. founder Steve Jobs described Akers as \\"smart, eloquent, fantastic salesperson, but he didn‚Äôt know anything about product.‚Äù The company's difficulties weren't caused by Akers alone, as some suggested that he was merely doing what he had been \\"programmed\\" to do by an outdated \\"IBM system\\", while a complacent board of directors was also blamed. ===Other business roles=== Akers was on the board of directors of Lehman Brothers when it filed for bankruptcy. ==Personal== Akers died of a stroke at age 79 in Boston, Massachusetts on August 22, 2014.New York Times' John F.

He attended the University of Minnesota and Allegheny College, taking classes in Science, Literature and Art. In 1910 Akerson started at Harvard University, later receiving a BA in Political Science in 1912. Akerson married Harriet Blake, a Wellesley College graduate, on June 28, 1915. They had three sons. George Edward Akerson as a young man. ==Early career== During his collegiate years, Akerson worked summers at the Minneapolis Tribune. After graduating from Harvard, Akerson worked there full-time as a reporter, with the 1912 Democratic National Convention as one of his first assignments. The Tribune made Akerson its Washington correspondent in 1921. While in Washington in the 1920s, Akerson advised the Republican Party on how to compete with the rising Non-Partisan League and Progressive movements in the Upper Midwest. That work brought Akerson to the attention of Herbert Hoover, who was then the Secretary of Commerce. Hoover had Akerson named as the secretary of the commission that ran the 1926 Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia, then hired Akerson as his private secretary. ==White House Press Secretary== During the 1928 presidential election, Governor Theodore Bilbo of Mississippi, a supporter of the Democratic nominee Governor Al Smith of New York, claimed that Herbert Hoover had danced with Mary Booze, the first African-American woman to sit on the Republican National Committee, while Hoover was in Mound Bayou, Mississippi, on an inspection tour of the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. Bilbo called Booze \\"a negress\\". In Hoover's defense, Akerson described Bilbo's remark as \\"the most indecent and unworthy statement in the whole of a bitter campaign\\". He also noted that the all-Democratic Mississippi State Legislature had commended Hoover's work on flood relief.The Shreveport Times, October 20, 1928, p. 1Billy Hathorn, The Republican Party in Louisiana, 1920-1980, (Natchitoches: Northwestern State University, 1980), p. 15 After Hoover's victory over Smith, Akerson served as White House Press Secretary, from 1929 to 1931, the first official holder of that title. During Akerson's tenure, the White House experienced increasing difficulties in its relations with the press corps. On January 2, 1931, Akerson resigned to take an executive position at the Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation. Hoover replaced him with Theodore Goldsmith Joslin. ==Later career and death== Akerson worked at Paramount for two years, then became the executive secretary of the National Code Authority of the Paper Distributing Trade. Still aged in his 40s, Akerson developed kidney disease and died in 1937. ==References== * https://web.archive.org/web/20071004214651/http://www.whitehousehistory.org/03/subs_press/02.swf * http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=22676 * Moffett, L.

Emphasizing Judaism's constant development along history and universalist traits, Geiger sought to re-formulate received forms and design what he regarded as a religion compliant with modern times. ==Biography== As a child, Geiger started doubting the traditional understanding of Judaism when his studies in classical history seemed to contradict the biblical claims of divine authority. At the age of seventeen, he began writing his first work, a comparison between the legal style of the Mishnah and Biblical and Talmudic law. He also worked on a dictionary of Mishnaic (Rabbinic) Hebrew. Geiger's friends provided him with financial assistance which enabled him to attend the University in Heidelberg, to the great disappointment of his family. His main focus was centered on the areas of philology, Syriac, Hebrew, and classics, but he also attended lectures in philosophy and archaeology. After one semester, he transferred to the University of Bonn, where he studied at the same time as Samson Raphael Hirsch. Hirsch initially formed a friendship with Geiger, and with him organized a society of Jewish students for the stated purpose of practicing homiletics, but with the deeper intention of bringing them closer to Jewish values. It was to this society that Geiger preached his first sermon (January 2, 1830). In later years, he and Hirsch became bitter opponents as the leaders of two opposing Jewish movements. At Bonn, Geiger began an intense study of Arabic and the Koran, winning a prize for his essay, written originally in Latin, and later published in German under the title \\"Was hat Mohammed aus dem Judenthume aufgenommen? (\\"What did Mohammed take from Judaism?\\"). The essay earned Geiger a doctorate at the University of Marburg. It demonstrated that large parts of the Koran were taken from, or based on, rabbinic literature. (On this, see History of the Quran). This book was Geiger's first step in a much larger intellectual project. Geiger sought to demonstrate Judaism's central influence on Christianity and Islam. He believed that neither movement possessed religious originality, but were simply a vehicle to transmit the Jewish monotheistic belief to the pagan world. Geiger, circa 1840. At this time, no university professorships were available in Germany to Jews; so, Geiger was forced to seek a position as rabbi. He found a position in the Jewish community of Wiesbaden (1832‚Äì1837). There, he continued his academic publications primarily through the scholarly journals he founded and edited, including Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift f√ºr j√ºdische Theologie (1835‚Äì1839) and J√ºdische Zeitschrift f√ºr Wissenschaft und Leben (1862‚Äì1875). His journals became important vehicles in their day for publishing Jewish scholarship, chiefly historical and theological studies, as well as a discussion of contemporary events. By that time, Geiger had begun his program of religious reforms, chiefly in the synagogue liturgy. For example, he abolished the prayers of mourning for the Temple, believing that since Jews were German citizens, such prayers would appear to be disloyal to the ruling power and could possibly spark anti-Semitism. Geiger was the driving force in convening several synods of reform-minded Rabbis with the intention of formulating a program of progressive Judaism. However, unlike Samuel Holdheim, he did not want to create a separate community. Rather, his goal was to change Judaism from within.Meyer, Michael A. Response to Modernity: A History of the Reform Movement in Judaism. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988, p. 90, 419 (footnote #109). Conclusions based on published correspondence between Abraham Geiger and a close friend, Joseph Derenbourg. ==Reformer== Abraham Geiger by Lesser Ury, ca. 1905. In the Germany of the 19th century, Geiger and Samuel Holdheim, along with Israel Jacobson and Leopold Zunz, stood out as the founding fathers of Reform Judaism. Geiger was a more moderate and scholarly reformer, seeking to found this new branch of Judaism on the scientific study of history, without assuming that any Jewish text was divinely written. Geiger was not only a scholar and researcher commenting on important subjects and characters in Jewish history ‚Äì he was also a rabbi responsible for much of the reform doctrine of the mid-19th century. He contributed much of the character to the reform movement that remains today. Reform historian Michael A. Meyer has stated that, if any one person can be called the founder of Reform Judaism, it must be Geiger. Much of Geiger's writing has been translated into English from the original German. There have been many biographical and research texts about him, such as the work Abraham Geiger and the Jewish Jesus by Susannah Heschel (1998), which chronicles Geiger's radical contention that the \\"New Testament\\" illustrates Jesus was a Pharisee teaching Judaism. Some of Geiger's studies are included in The Origins of The Koran: Classic Essays on Islam's Holy Book edited by Ibn Warraq. Other works are Judaism and Islam (1833), and An Appeal to My Community (1842). ==Criticism== Samson Raphael Hirsch devoted a good many issues of his journal Jeschurun to criticizing Geiger's reform stance (published in English as Hirsch, Collected Writings). Some critics also attacked Geiger's opposition to a Jewish national identity; most notably, he was criticized when he refused to intervene on the behalf of the Jews of Damascus accused of ritual murder (a blood libel) in 1840. However, Jewish historian Steven Bayme has concluded that Geiger had actually vigorously protested on humanitarian grounds.Bayme, Steven (1997) Understanding Jewish History: Texts and Commentaries. Jersey City, NJ: KTAV. p. 282. ==Geiger and Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Judaism== ===Geiger's rejection of Orthodox Judaism=== To Geiger, Judaism was unique and meaningful because of its monotheism and ethics. He began to identify less with the \\"rigidity of Talmudic legalism, developed over centuries of ghettoization inflicted by Christian Intolerance ... in medieval Christendom\\", that defined and confined the existence of Orthodox Judaism in the 19th century in Germany. He believed that, \\"the Torah, as well as the Talmud, should be studied critically and from the point of view of the historian, that of evolution and development\\". As Geiger grew into his adolescence and young adulthood, he began to establish a more liberal approach to, and understanding of, Judaism than his traditional Orthodox Jewish background dictated. He thus rejected Orthodox Jewish tradition in favor of a liberal outlook. ===Conservative Judaism's rejection of Geiger=== In 1837, Geiger arranged a meeting of reform-minded rabbis in Wiesbaden for the purpose of discussing measures of concern to Judaism, and continued to be a leader of liberal German rabbinical thought through 1846. When he was nominated as a finalist for the position of Chief Rabbi in Breslau in 1838, a heated controversy sparked between conservative and liberal factions within the Jewish community. Orthodox factions accused Geiger of being a Karaite or Sadducee, and therefore prevented him from being appointed Chief Rabbi. In 1840, however, the Orthodox Rabbi of Breslau died, leading to the secession of the Orthodox faction and the appointment of Geiger as Chief Rabbi. Throughout his time in Breslau as Chief Rabbi and after, the Positive- Historical School of Rabbi Zecharias Frankel continued to reject Geiger's philosophies. In 1841, he and Frankel clashed at the second Hamburg Temple dispute. When the Jewish Theological Seminary was founded there in 1854, thanks in part to Geiger's efforts, he was not appointed to its faculty, though he had long been at the fore-front of attempts to establish a faculty of Jewish theology. More conservatives regarded Geiger's theological stance as too liberal. Therefore, in 1863, Geiger left Breslau to become a Rabbi of Liberal communities in Frankfurt and, later, Berlin. \\"Ultimately, in 1871, he was appointed to the faculty of the newly founded Reform rabbinical college in Berlin, Hochschule f√ºr die Wissenschaft des Judentums, where he spent his final years.\\" ===A new approach to Reform Judaism=== Initially, Reform Judaism grew out of some Jews being uninterested in the \\"strict observances required of Orthodoxy\\", and an attempt to alter the appearance and ritual of Judaism to mimic German Protestantism. Geiger, however, turned to a more \\"coherent ideological framework to justify innovations in the liturgy and religious practice\\". Geiger argued that, \\"Reform Judaism was not a rejection of earlier Judaism, but a recovery of the Pharisaic halakhic tradition, which is nothing other than the principle of continual further development in accord with the times, the principle of not being slaves to the letter of the Bible, but rather to witness over and over its spirit and its authentic faith- consciousness.\\" ==See also== *Lazarus Geiger *Origin and development of the Qur'an ==References== ===Geiger's works=== * Was hat Mohammed aus dem Judentume aufgenommen?

He was the son of Jahandar Shah. Born Aziz-ud-Din, the second son of Jahandar Shah, was raised to the throne by Imad-ul-Mulk after he deposed Ahmad Shah Bahadur in 1754. On ascending the throne, he took the title of Alamgir and tried to follow the approach of Aurangzeb (Alamgir I). At the time of his accession to throne he was an old man of 55 years. He had no experience of administration and warfare as he had spent most of his life in jail. He was a weak ruler, with all powers vested in the hand of his vizier, Ghazi-ud-Din Imad-ul-Mulk. In 1756, Ahmad Shah Abdali invaded India once again and captured Delhi and plundered Mathura. Marathas became more powerful because of their collaboration with Imad-ul-Mulk, and dominated the whole of northern India. This was the peak of Maratha expansion, which caused great trouble for the Mughal Empire, already weak with no strong ruler. Relations between Alamgir II and his usurping vizier, Imad-ul-Mulk had now deteriorated. He was murdered by Imad-ul-Mulk. Alamgir II's son Ali Gauhar escaped persecution from Delhi, while Shah Jahan III was placed on the throne. ==Early life== He was born on 6 June 1699 at Burhanpur and was the second son of Maaz-ud-Din, the son of future Emperor Bahadur Shah I. Alamgir II was 7 when his great-grandfather Aurangzeb died in the Deccan. After the death of his grandfather, Bahadur Shah I, and the war of succession that followed, his father, Maaz-ud-Din, was defeated, by the next Mughal Emperor, Farrukhsiyar. Aziz-ud-Din was then imprisoned in 1714 and released in 1754, by usurping Vizier Imad-ul-Mulk, he perceived Aziz-ud-Din as a frail personality who would not object his regime. Therefore, on 2 June 1754, Aziz-ud-Din was given the title Alamgir II by the vizier out of his own recommendation, as he wanted to follow the centralised approach of Aurangzeb. ==Succession to throne== Imad- ul-Mulk, a persecutor of the Mughal imperial family, holds a banquet. Imad-ul- Mulk was clearly a man of no principles and was commonly criticised for his extreme selfishness. he hired Maratha mercenaries to do his biddinghttp://www.emotional-literacy-education.com/classic-books- online-a/tfmeh10.htm and put all the imperial revenues into his own pocket and starved Alamgir II's family. He persecuted Ali Gauhar, the elder son of Muhy- us-Sunnat. Since then, relations between Alamgir II and Imad-ul-Mulk's regime were so bad that the latter got him assassinated in November 1759. ==Reign== After the emergence of Alamgir II the Mughal Empire had impulsively began to re-centralize, particularly when many Nawabs sought the gratification of the Mughal Emperor and his co-ordination regarding their resistance to the Maratha. This development was clearly unwelcome by Imad-ul-Mulk who sought to strengthen his authoritarianism with the undaunted support of the Marathas. ===Alliance with the Durrani Emirate=== In the year 1755, the acclaimed Mughal viceroy of Punjab, Muin ul-Mulk died his widow Mughlam Begum desperately sought the assistance of Ahmad Shah Durrani to halt any succession struggle and to quell the Sikh rebels in the eastern regions. Ahmad Shah Durrani and his forces then marched into Lahore in the year 1756 and appointed his son Timur Shah Durrani as the new viceroy at Lahore, under the protection of the commander Jahan Khan and also placed Adina Beg as the Faujdar of Doab. Ahmad Shah Durrani then plundered Sikh and Hindu inhabitants in the unstable and outlawed eastern regions of the Punjab. He then marched towards Delhi, in October 1757, the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II with courtiers such as Shah Waliullah, nobles such as Najib-ul-Daula, and the imperial family went to meet Ahmad Shah Durrani, whose forces then engaged the Marathas in combat and threatened to overthrow and execute the regime of Imad-ul-Mulk. Ahmad Shah Durrani's relations with the Mughal Emperor, strengthened further when his son Timur Shah Durrani was chosen as the suitor of Alamgir II's daughter Zuhra Begum. Ahmad Shah Durrani himself also married Hadrat Begum the daughter of the former Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah.https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.99051/2015.99051.Mughal- Rule-In-India_djvu.txt Ahmad Shah Durrani returned to Kabul leaving his forces led by his son Timur Shah Durrani consolidating themselves inside the garrisons of Lahore where they founded the Zamzama cannon with the assistance of Mughal Metalsmiths. He was supported by Mohammad Bahawal Khan II (Nawab Amir of Bhawalpur) and Muhammad Nasir Khan I (Khanate of Kalat).http://thebaluch.com/documents/Nasir%20Khan%20Noori.pdf File:Portrait of Ahmad-Shah Durrani. Mughal miniature. ca. 1757, Biblioth√®que nationale de France.jpgAhmad Shah Durrani. File:Temur-Shah.jpgTimur Shah Durrani. ===Siege of Delhi (1757)=== Patthargarh fort (literally meaning: \\"stone stronghold\\") outside Najibabad, built by Najib ad-Dawlah in 1755, during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II. In July 1757, the Maratha's led by Raghunathrao rejected the alliance established between the Durrani Empire and the Mughal Empire, they were assisted by Imad-ul-Mulk and encamped 30 km opposite to the Red Fort and occupied all the villages by the Jamuna they began to stage the Siege of Delhi (1757). The Marathas fought against Alamgir II's incumbent Mir Bakshi (\\"Paymaster\\") Najib-ul-Daula along with his lieutenants Qutub Shah and Aman Khan and a Mughal Army of 2,500 garrisoned inside the metropolis of Delhi. The angry Maratha set ferries ablaze and stopped food supplies from entering Delhi, while Najib-ul-Daula positioned his heavy artillery outside the vicinity of the Red Fort. Unable to gain any assistance form Ahmad Shah Durrani, who was engaged in quelling various rebellions near Herat; Najib-ul-Daula surrendered after resisting the combined brigands of Maratha Confederacy for more than five months, he conceded defeat and withdrew to Najibabad. When the Marathas entered Delhi the emperor Alamgir II and his royal family had somehow fled to Bharatpur State. The Marathas looted and plundered the city and the people of Delhi. Mosques and Shrines built by the Mughals were desecrated; and the Peshwa conspired to place Vishwasrao upon the Mughal throne. Imad-ul-Mulk was reappointed Mir Bakshi and with the support of the Marathas. Not long after entering Delhi the Marathas encountered a Jat regiment sent by Suraj Mal who now began to claim sovereignty over Delhi. The Jat also plundered Delhi but soon afterwards made it possible for Alamgir II and the Mughal royal family to return to Delhi from Bharatpur. However, despite losing control of Delhi, Najib-ul-Daula and his associates, such as Qutub Khan and Abdus Samad Khan the Mughal Faujdar of Sirhind, continued to challenge the Maratha Confederacy and its allies during confrontations at Saharanpur and Shahabad Markanda. In response the Marathas sacked the inhabitants of Taraori, Karnal and Kunjpura. The Maratha attack upon Kunjpura triggered a military response by Ahmad Shah Durrani. Whose forces crossed the sacred rivers of India in search of their Maratha opponents. ====Subjects opposing the Maratha Confederacy==== In the year 1756, Alamgir II sympathised with the cause of his loyal Nawabs of Kurnool, Cuddapah and Savanur, when their assigned territories were ravaged and plundered until 1757 by the Maratha chieftain Balaji Baji Rao. ===Third Carnatic War (1757‚Äì1763)=== Mughal artillerymen at Plassey during the Carnatic Wars. ====Loss of Bengal==== Alamgir II grieved the death of Alivardi Khan the famous Nawab of Bengal, who annually pledged 5 million dams to the imperial court. His successor Siraj-ud-Daula was recognised as the next Nawab of Bengal, but he faced internal rivals who refused to consider the Firman granted by Alamgir II to Siraj-ud-Daula. These internal conflicts would lead Siraj-ud-Daula to hastily annex Calcutta from the English East India Company, without the permission of the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II and Salabat Jung. Siraj-ud-Daula was quickly defeated by Clive who recaptured Calcutta and defeated Siraj-ud-Daula during the Battle of Plassey in the year 1757. After the annihilation of his entire army Siraj-ud-Daula fled and was killed by the forces of the treacherous Mir Jafar. The deceased Siraj-ud-Daula's pretensions were criticised in the Mughal imperial court by Ghulam Husain Tabatabai, and Alamgir II refused to recognise Mir Jafar as the next Nawab of Bengal. In response to the imperial court's decision Mir Jafar thus consolidated and alliance with the manipulative Imad-ul-Mulk against the imperial family. ====Authority in the Deccan==== Throughout Alamgir II's reign French commandant de Bussy and Lally and their allies such as Salabat Jung and Hyder Ali greatly contributed to the advancement of forces in the Deccan opposed to the utter dominance of the Maratha renegades, their achievements had earned them fame throughout the influential circles within the Mughal Empire. In the year 1756, Salabat Jung's forces utilised heavy muskets known as Catyocks, which were attached to the ground, it was known to have fired more rapidly than a cannon. These new weapons would completely reverse fortunes of the Maratha rebels. Soon after the Battle of Plassey, the French commander De Bussy, also entitled Saif-ud-Daula Umdat-ul-Mulk and Mansabdar of 7000, by the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II. He captured the Northern Circars from the British along with his assistant Hyder Jung the \\"Vakil\\" (attorney) representing the French within the Mughal Empire and Salabat Jung. However the Northern Circars were retaken by Forde in the year 1758 and De Bussy was recalled to France. Fearing the worst Salabat Jung reconciled with the English East India Company and recognised their protectorate and was soon overthrown by his own brother Nizam Ali Khan. ===Nawab of Bhopal=== In the year 1758, the Mughal Army of Faiz Mohammad Khan the Nawab of Bhopal was treacherously attacked by his step- mother Mamola Bai who suddenly besieged the Mughal garrison at Fortress of Raisen in 1758, according to the layout of the Marathas. The outraged Mughal Emperor Alamgir II, then issued a Firman supporting Faiz Mohammad Khan was the Nawab of Bhopal the only chosen administrator of Raisen, the emperor also granted the title Bahadur to Faiz Mohammad Khan the Nawab of Bhopal. However the fort remained under the control of Mamola Bai and the renegade Nanasaheb Peshwa. The fortress of Raisen was quickly retaken by Faiz Mohammad Khan in the year 1760, after the tragic assassination of Alamgir II and after Sadashivrao Bhau threatened to ravage Bhopal prior to the Third Battle of Panipat. It is believed that Faiz Mohammad Khan's Sepoy's were among those who had cut off the various supply routes of the Marathas just before the Third Battle of Panipat. ===Nawab of Cambay=== Najm-ad-Dawla supported British presence in Cambay. Turning much of his estate into an international \\"safe zone\\". Although it is likely that he too had to face threats from the Maratha climax. ===\\"Nawab of Mysore\\"=== In 1758, Hyder Ali and his Sepoy captured Bangalore from \\"Khande Rao of the Maratha Confederacy\\". In honour of his achievements during the Carnatic Wars, the king gave him the title \\"Nawab Haider Ali Khan Bahadur\\". ===Zenith of the Maratha Confederacy=== Maratha Confederacy at its zenith in 1760, the Peshwa discussed abolishing the Mughal Empire and placing Vishwasrao on the imperial throne in Delhi. In 1758 the Marathas led by Raghunathrao occupied Lahore after extracted an extortion of imperial wealth from Imad-ul-Mulk, together they conspired the overthrow of young Timur Shah Durrani. Raghunathrao drove out Jahan Khan and Timur Shah Durrani, the son and viceroy of Ahmad Shah Durrani. Timur Shah Durrani and his forces were forced to retreat from Lahore to Peshawar under the force of attacks from Sikhs and Marathas. This victory made the belligerent Peshwa, grandiosely sack Delhi and hype their intentions of placing Vishwasrao on the Mughal throne. ===Assassination=== Many of his actions had angered the people of India. Fearing a backlash in the summer of the year 1759 Prince Ali Gauhar escaped from Delhi. Agitated by the daring escape Imad-ul-Mulk and Sadashivrao Bhau reckoned that Alamgir II was about to advance his son Prince Ali Gauhar, to dispossess and overthrow their regime. After detailed consideration Imad- ul-Mulk and an angry mob of various ethnic groups plotted to murder the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II and the assassinations of prominent members of his family in the winter of 1759. Alamgir II was murdered because he refused to lower the Afghan flag. ===According to legend=== During his reign religious feuds became common among the individuals of the Durbar, and communal duels between rivals became a common occurrence during his reign. After his assassination Maratha women set out on a pilgrimage to Northern India, specifically Delhi where the Mughals mourned their slain emperor. ====Aftermath==== Sadashivrao Bhau then personally chose the usurping, Shah Jahan III as the new Mughal Emperor and began a campaign of plundering the Jewels and ornaments of the Mughal imperial court, he also defaced mosques, tombs and shrines that the Mughals had built in Agra and Delhi, he then desecrated the imperial Moti Masjid and looted its exquisite jewelled decorations into booty for the ravaging Marathas. The defeat of Alamgir II's son-in-law, Timur Shah Durrani by the Marathas in the year 1760, provoked the wrath of Ahmad Shah Durrani, who launched a massive campaign gathering more troops than ever before. In response to the atrocious crimes committed by Imad-ul-Mulk and Sadashivrao Bhau; Najib-ud-Daula and his firm alliance of principal Muslim nobles in the Mughal Empire recaptured Delhi and placed it under the nominal authority of Shah Alam II. In the south Hyder Ali and his Mysore Army ferociously attacked the Maratha. Meanwhile, Shah Alam II anticipated the collapse of the Maratha and declared Shuja-ud-Daula his Grand Vizier and Najib-ud-Daula as his honorary Mukhtar Khas (Chief Representative). These developments eventually culminated into rise of religious and political loyalties that eventually clashed at the \\"Third Battle of Panipat\\" in the year 1761. ==Foreign relations== === Seven Years' War === In 1756, the Seven Years' War had broken out and Alamgir II was supported by various international belligerents of that war. It was the first global war in which the Great Mogul had his involvement apart from the boundaries of India. Alamgir II initially involved in that war because the British were hasty in their attempts to conquer Bengal Subah. A portrait of Marquis de Bussy- Castelnau. In 1755, De Bussy received letter from new Mughal Emperor Alamgir II requesting French assistance to put down the Maratha Confederacy. Alamgir II asked if it was possible for De Bussy to dispatch a French contingent of 1000 strong to protect the Mughal Empire's capitol at Delhi. Alamgir II also promised to pay a hefty sum for the maintenance of the French and even promised to settle disputes in the Carnatic Wars in favour of the French East India Company. In 1757, Alamgir II had successfully achieved peace between the Durrani Emirate and the Mughal Empire. Alamgir II even secured a matrimonial alliance when Timur Shah Durrani married Gauhar Afroz Begam the daughter of the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II in February 1757 and Ahmad Shah Durrani married Hazrat Begum the daughter of the former Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah in 1757. in the year 1751, the Swedish East India Company was operating in Surat as a co-belligerent of Alamgir II. They were probably instrumental in assisting the first Nawab of Junagadh. It is believed that Alamgir II even tried to reconcile the English East India Company and the French East India Company before his death in 1759. ==Death== Silver rupee issued in the name of Alamgir II, date of AH 1172 (c. 1758). The newly appointed Mughal Grand Vizier after Ahmad Shah Durrani's invasion was Najib-ud-Daula who tried to consolidate the remains of the Mughal Empire by uniting distant Faujdars, Nawab's and Nizams into a common cause against the Marathas. Fearing their wrath the deposed Imad-ul-Mulk aligned himself with the Maratha leader Sadashivrao Bhau and launched an counterattack against Najib-ud-Daula which lasted 15 days and resulted in the defeat of Najib-ud-Daula who was driven North. Imad-ul-Mulk then feared that the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II would recall Ahmad Shah Durrani, or use his son Prince Ali Gauhar, to dispossess him of his newfound power with the Marathas. Therefore, Imad-ul-Mulk plotted to murder the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II and his family. A few Mughal Princes, including Ali Gauhar desperately managed to escape before assassination. In November 1759, the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II was told that a pious man had come to meet him, Alamgir II, ever so eager to meet holy men, set out immediately to meet him at Kotla Fateh Shah, he was stabbed repeatedly by Imad-ul-Mulk's assassins. The Mughal Emperor Alamgir II's death was mourned throughout the Mughal Empire, particularly by the Muslim populace. After the assassination of Alamgir II in 1759, the Peshwa under the sway of Sadashivrao Bhau had reached the peak of its short-lived power particularly when their involvement in the assassination had become eminent when he discussed abolishing the Mughal Empire and placing Vishwasrao on the throne in Delhi by bribing or deposing Imad-ul-Mulk. ==See also== * Alamgir I * Shah Alam II * Imad-ul-Mulk ==References== ==External links== Category:1699 births Category:1759 deaths Category:Mughal emperors Category:Timurid monarchs Category:People from Burhanpur ","title":"Alamgir II"},{"id":"1271208","text":"CFTM-DT, virtual and VHF digital channel 10, is the flagship station of the French-language TVA television network, licensed to Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The station is owned by the Groupe TVA subsidiary of Quebecor Media. CFTM-DT's studios are located on Boulevard de Maisonneuve East and Rue Alexandre de S√®ve in the Ville-Marie borough of Montreal, and its transmitter is located on Voie Camillien Houde (near Mount Royal). On cable, the station is available on Vid√©otron Illico digital cable channel 4 in standard definition and channel 604 in high definition in the Montreal area; Vid√©otron also offers a three- hour delayed feed to Illico subscribers on channel 401. ==History== CFTM-TV's third logo used from 1969 until 1978, as \\"CFTM 10\\". It opened on February 19, 1961, a few weeks after CFCF-TV went on the air for the first time. It was owned by Joseph Alexandre de S√®ve and his company, T√©l√©-M√©tropole. At first it relied primarily on kinescopes from RTL, and also from T√©l√© Monte Carlo, but it wasn't long before it settled into a more peculiar and local form. On April 14, 1963, CFTM started sharing programs with CJPM-TV in Chicoutimi (now Saguenay) in the Saguenay‚ÄìLac-Saint-Jean region on the day the latter station signed on. They were joined by CFCM-TV in Quebec City in 1964. This was the informal beginning of TVA, though the network wasn't officially established until September 12, 1971. When de S√®ve died in 1968, the city government renamed the street in front of CFTM's studios rue Alexandre de S√®ve in his honour. CFTM has always been by far the largest station in the TVA network. As such, it dominated the network long before T√©l√©-M√©tropole bought majority control of TVA in 1990. At one point, CFTM produced as much as 90 percent of TVA's programming. Even today, TVA's network feed is little more than a retransmission of CFTM. Whenever CFTM has to interrupt its programming for breaking news or weather alerts in Montreal, the entire network usually gets interrupted as well. CFTM-TV was essentially available on satellite beginning November 1, 1981 as TCTV, carried via Cancom by cable television operators across Canada, though not in most major cities. TCTV carried mainly the same programs as CFTM, but with some local news and programming from other TVA affiliates. The TCTV service ended when the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved TVA for a national network license in 1998. Since May 1, 1999, all Canadian cable companies have been required to carry a TVA station. CFTM is the affiliate carried in most markets outside of Quebec ‚Äî excepting some markets in Northern Ontario, Eastern Ontario and New Brunswick, which have long carried the stations in adjacent markets. The station also provides a time-shifted feed for cable companies in western Canada, delayed three hours after the original broadcast, matching up with Pacific Time. == Digital television and high definition== CFTM received CRTC approval in March 2006 for its request to broadcast digitally on UHF channel 59Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2006‚Äì78, 15 March 2006, re: TVA Group Inc, Montr√©al, Qu√©bec and was granted a requested extension to August 31, 2009 to launch this service but the launch never occurred.Broadcasting Public Notice 2008-0050-0 17 March 2008, approval of extension to 31 August 2009 to commence operation of transitional digital television at CFTM-TV Montr√©al On July 6, 2009, as part of a license renewal hearing, TVA was granted a second extension in which to launch CFTM-DT. During the analogue television shutdown and digital conversion, which took place on August 31, 2011, CFTM silenced its analogue transmitter on September 1, 2011 at 12:01 am during a movie's airing and began broadcasting a digital signal a few minutes later on its old analog channel number, 10. == References * CFTM at TV Hat * * FTM-DT FTM-DT Category:Television channels and stations established in 1961 Category:National Hockey League over-the-air television broadcasters Category:Montreal Canadiens broadcasters Category:1961 establishments in Quebec ","title":"CFTM-DT"},{"id":"1271209","text":"Lent, in Western Christianity, is the period before the Christian holy day of Easter.

Schulberg later said: \\"In a small way, I wanted to help.... The only thing I knew was writing, so I decided to start a writers' workshop.\\" The group, which functioned from 1965 to 1973, was composed primarily of young African Americans in Watts and the surrounding neighborhoods. Early on, the Workshop included a theatrical component and one of the founders was the actor Yaphet Kotto. The group expanded its facilities and activities over the next several years with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. Government files later revealed that the Workshop had been the target of covert operations by the FBI. Well-known writers to emerge from the Workshop include Quincy Troupe, Johnie Scott, Eric Priestley, Ojenke, Herbert Simmons, and Wanda Coleman, as well as the poetry group Watts Prophets. ==History== The Watts Writers Workshop was begun in September 1965. Founding members were: Ernest Mayhand, Leumas Sirrah, James Thomas Jackson, Birdell Chew Moore, Sonora McKeller, Jimmy Sherman, Johnie Scott, Guadelupe de Saavedra, Harley Mims, Eric Priestley, Alvin Saxon Jr. (Ojenke), Ryan Vallejo Kennedy, and Blossom Powe. On August 16, 1966, the Workshop was the subject of an hour-long NBC TV documentary, The Angry Voices of Watts, that drew press attention and support from prominent figures across the country, such as James Baldwin, John Steinbeck, Richard Burton, Steve Allen, Abbey Lincoln, Ira Gershwin, and Senator Robert F. Kennedy. In 1967 two anthologies of writing from the group appeared, both edited by Schulberg: From the Ashes: Voices of Watts, and the fall issue of The Antioch Review entitled \\"The Watts Writers Workshop\\". In 1968, Watts Poets - A Book of New Poetry & Essays was published, edited by Quincy Troupe. The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) awarded a grant of $25,000 awarded to enable the group to establish a meeting space for its writing programs as well as housing for some of the Workshop's members, and a year later gave a second grant of $25,000 in support of expanding the Workshop's programs. The workshop continued to expand. In 1972, television personality Sue Baker organized the teaching of a street dance called Campbellocking within the workshop's theatrical department, forming one of the first street dance groups called \\"Creative Generation\\", which was composed of several of the local street dancers who became popular on the television dance show Soul Train. Harry Dolan, the director of the Watts Writers Workshop, was attempting to keep it going after the loss of federal funding by holding a fundraising dinner in April 1973, but within months the workshop building with its 350-seat theatre was burned down by FBI informant Darthard Perry (a.k.a. Ed Riggs), who began confessing to his activities in 1975. Perry stated in a 1980 interview with WABC-TV's Like It Is that \\"funding had been cut to the Workshop, it had been cut out, but it looked like there was a possibility of a grant being given back to the Workshop and if there was no theater there would be no grant.\\" (Interview with Darthard Perry.) ==Footnotes== ==References== ==Sources== *Rapoport, Roger (1977). \\"Meet America‚Äôs Meanest Dirty Trickster: The Man the FBI Used to Destroy the Black Movement in Los Angeles.\\" Mother Jones, April 1977, pp. 19-23, 59-61. *Widener, Daniel (2003). \\"Something Else: Creative Community and Black Liberation in Postwar Los Angeles.\\" Ph.D. dissertation.

He moved to the United States in 1818 and settled there. In 1829 and 1833 he negotiated treaties on behalf of the United Nations of Chippewa, Ottawa and Potawatomi with the United States, and became a leader of a Potawatomi band at Trader's Point (Iowa Territory). He worked to gain the boundary long promised by the British between white settlers and Indians, but never achieved it. Born in a Mohawk refugee camp near Fort Niagara, Billy was the son of a Potawatomi mother (Misheswans) (Caldwell Oral Family History - Ontario) and William Caldwell, a Scots-Irish immigrant to North America and a Loyalist British officer during the American Revolutionary War. He became multilingual, learning Potawatomi, English, and French. After moving to the United States in 1818, Caldwell became a fur trader and learned the Potawatomi language, an Algonquian language; he negotiated with numerous tribes in the Lake Michigan area. He gained their respect and also acted as a translator and negotiator between the government and American Indians. In 1829, Caldwell represented the Chippewa, Ottawa and Potawatomi peoples of the United Nations Tribes in negotiating the Second Treaty of Prairie du Chien with the United States. For his work, the US granted him a 1600-acre tract, known as the Caldwell Reserve, along the Chicago River. Eighty acres is included within the Cook County Forest Preserve. Together with Alexander Robinson, Caldwell also negotiated the Treaty of Chicago in 1833 for the United Nations Tribes. The US had appointed the two mixed-race men as chiefs in 1829 to fill vacant positions, to encourage the United Nations Tribes to sign the cessions. The treaty led to the final removal of American Indians from that region, to west of the Mississippi River. In 1835, Caldwell migrated with his people from the Chicago region west to Platte County, Missouri. As a result of the Platte Purchase in 1836, Caldwell and his band were removed from Missouri to Iowa Territory, to the area of Trader's Point (Pointe aux Poules) on the east bank of the Missouri River. While living at Trader's Point, Caldwell led a band of approximately 2000 Potawatomi. Their settlement became known as Camp Caldwell. In 1841 Caldwell died; scholars believe it may have been because of cholera. ==Early life and education== Soon after the American Revolutionary War, Billy Caldwell, was born in 1782 (as documented through two autobiographical letters) in a Mohawk refugee camp near Fort Niagara to a Mohawk woman. His father was William Caldwell, a Scots-Irish immigrant who came to North America in 1773 and served as a Loyalist soldier in the war.Gayford, Peter T. \\"Chief Billy Caldwell, His Chicago River Reserve, and Only Known Surviving Heir (illigetimate Children surviveed in Southern Ontario- Walpole Is. FN, 1827) : A 21st Century Biography on One of North America‚Äôs Significant Historical Figures and His Bloodline: Part 1 (Early Life)\\" , The Chicago History Journal (July 2011), accessed 11 August 2011 Living first in Virginia, in 1774 his father had fought as an officer with Lord Dunmore and was wounded.\\"William Caldwell\\", United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada, accessed 11 August 2011 After recovering, he went to Fort Niagara in New York, where he fought with the partisan Butler's Rangers against Patriot colonists in New York and Pennsylvania. After the war, Caldwell abandoned Billy and his mother, moving to the Detroit area. He resettled as a Loyalist in Upper Canada, where he was granted land by the British Crown. In addition to clearing land for his own farm, he helped develop the town of Amherstburg, in present-day Ontario. In 1783, the senior Caldwell married Suzanne Baby (daughter of Jacques Baby dit Dup√©ron), of French-Canadian descent. They eventually had eight children together. In 1789, when Billy was seven, his father took the boy to live with him and his Canadian wife, who wanted to rear him in the Catholic faith. Billy was given a basic Anglo-Canadian education and became Catholic. Living with his father's family, Billy learned to speak both English and French, after having grown up learning the Iroquoian Mohawk. Although Billy worked on his father's farm as he was growing up, he wanted a different life. ==Career== In 1797 at the age of 17, Billy Caldwell entered United States (US) territory for the first time, to learn the fur trade business (he traded for much of his life). He kept his British Canadian loyalties and learned Potowatomi, an Algonquian language, for dealing with the several tribes of that language family near Lake Michigan. Billy Caldwell Jr. was considered the left hand of the Great Leader Tecumseh, One of North America's greatest European resistance movements. In 1812, after the Battle of Fort Dearborn, Caldwell at age 32 returned to Canada to enlist in the British service; he looked for his father's help to gain a commission. The senior Caldwell by then was a Lieutenant Colonel and had gained commissions for his sons by Suzanne. The regular army did not accept Billy Caldwell, but he was commissioned as a captain in the Indian Department. By then he had become influential among the Ojibwa, Ottawa and Potawatomi, Algonquian-speaking tribes inhabiting the area around Lake Michigan.Gayford, Peter T., \\"Billy Caldwell: Updated History, Part 2 (Indian Affairs)\\" , Chicago History Journal, July 2011, accessed 11 August 2011 Severely wounded in his first combat action, Caldwell, Jr. recovered and participated in several more battles along the northern frontier. He was disgusted that the British abandoned their First Nations allies at the Battle of the Thames, when General Proctor made an early retreat before the US forces. By account of natives at the battle, Caldwell was one of the last to see Tecumseh alive, walking away after the battle mortally wounded in the chest. In addition, through this period Caldwell had worked with the British in the hope they would deliver the long-promised boundary between European and First Nations settlement, but each war ended with their ceding more land to the Americans. In 1814, the Canadians appointed the senior Caldwell as Superintendent of Indians for the Western District, a position for which the younger Caldwell had competed as well. He was appointed second to his father. In 1815 Amherstburg, Ontario's Commandant, Reginald James, suspended Caldwell, Sr. because of problems in supplying the Indians; he appointed Billy Caldwell as Superintendent. The Indian Department quickly found that he could not manage the work and \\"eased him out\\" the following year, in 1816. The younger Caldwell inherited a plot of land in early 1818 after his father's death, but decided to return to the US. He settled in the Fort Dearborn area (now Chicago); he had long been recruited by Americans because of his influence with the local tribes. He worked hard to gain the Americans' trust. At the same time he continued to work with a local fur trade firm and became active with the tribes in the area. He became more politically active and in 1825, Caldwell sought an appointment to become a justice of the peace. In August 1826, Caldwell served as a judge in Peoria County, Illinois's first election. Also in 1826, he was recommended to the Governor of Illinois to hold the Justice of the Peace position for Peoria County. That year, he became an appraiser for the estate of John Crafts, a local trader who died during the year of 1825. In 1827, Caldwell worked for the United States to secure information related to a possible Winnebago uprising. In 1829, Caldwell became one of several chiefs to represent the United Nations of the Chippewa, Ottawa, and Potawatomi in negotiations with the United States in the Second Treaty of Prairie du Chien. The US was working on Indian Removal, the process that would be authorized by Congress in 1830. At the same time, their agents were also negotiating with the Winnebago for cessions and removal. \\"Through his involvement in the process, he became recognized as a chief of the United Nations,\\" and was so introduced by their spokesmen. Also negotiating as a chief was Alexander Robinson (also known as Chechepinquay or The Squinter), a mixed-race Potawatomi who was Caldwell's long-time friend. He later said that Dr. Wolcott, the US Indian Agent to the United Nations, arranged for both Robinson and Caldwell to be selected as chiefs to fill two vacancies. It was an example of US intervention into tribes' processes for identifying their own leaders. Wolcott wanted to have chiefs who would favor the treaty, fearing that unless all the chiefs' positions filled, the United Nations would not sign. The US granted both Robinson and Caldwell large plots of land under the treaty for their parts in influencing the other chiefs to sign the land cession. Caldwell was given 1600 acres on the Chicago River. In 1833, he helped found the first Catholic church in Chicago, Saint Mary of the Assumption. It was located at what is now Lake Street west of State Street.Gayford, Peter T., \\"Billy Caldwell: Updated History, Part 3 (The Reserve and Death)\\" , Chicago History Journal, (August 2011), accessed 11 August 2011 In 1833, together with Robinson, Caldwell was one of the chiefs representing the United Nations of the three tribes in negotiating the Treaty of Chicago. By this, the Potawatomi ceded the \\"last of their Illinois and Wisconsin lands and their last reservations in Michigan.\\"Helen Hornbeck Tanner, \\"Treaties\\", Encyclopedia of Chicago, 2005, 11 August 2011 Caldwell and his band migrated west in 1835, first settling in Missouri west of the Mississippi River. The treaty provided for a $10,000 payment each to Caldwell and Robinson, and a $400 lifetime annuity for Caldwell, with $300 annually for Robinson. Before the US Senate ratified the treaty in 1835, it reduced the lump-sum payments to the men to $5000 each, but left their annuities intact. Robinson and some other M√©tis remained in Illinois on their private tracts of land, but most of the United Nations Tribes removed to Missouri and then to Iowa.R. David Edmunds, \\"Potowatomis\\", Encyclopedia of Chicago, accessed 26 July 2012 ===Caldwell Reserve=== The US had awarded Caldwell's Reserve, 1600 acres on the Chicago River, to Sauganash in 1829 as a result of his services in negotiating the Prairie du Chien treaty. In 1833, likely due to the declining fur trade and development opportunities, Caldwell began selling off his land by contracting with the land speculator Arthur Bronson from New York. According to his land patent, to be legally binding, each deed had to have a president's endorsed signature upon it. All unsold parcels were to be reserved for Caldwell's heirs forever, in trust with the US Bureau of Indian Affairs. The land patent was not completed until 1839, and the deeds did not gain a president's signature until 1841, after Caldwell and his band had left the area for the West. In all, six land sales took place from Caldwell's Reserve. These land transactions included: 80 acres to George W. Dole and Richard Hamilton in June 1833 for $100; 160 acres to Richard Nicolas, Sarah Amantus, Eleanor Hamilton, and infant heirs of Richard Jo and Diana W. Hamilton in July 1833 for $200; 160 acres to Philo Carpenter in July 1833 for $200; 720 acres to Arthur Bronson in 1833 for $900; 160 acres to Captain Seth Johnson in November 1833 for $200; 80 and 160 acres, respectively, to Julius B. Kingsbury in November 1834 for $300. To date, the Northern 80 acres of Caldwell's Reserve were never legally conveyed for sale with a president's signature of approval. They are included within the Cook County Forest Preserve and Wildwood community of Chicago. ==Marriage and family== Caldwell married La Natte about 1804, who died after the birth of their first child, Alexander. She was the niece of the powerful Potowatomi chief, Mad Sturgeon. Alexander died in 1832 in his twenties from alcoholism. Caldwell married again, but his second wife also died within a year after the birth of their first child. Before leaving the Chicago area, Caldwell married a third time, on November 18, 1834. His bride was Saqua (also called Masaqua) LeGrand, a M√©tis woman of Potawatomi and French descent. They had a daughter and son born after they migrated west. Only the son, Pe-y-mo, survived to adulthood. Later in the nineteenth century, Pe-y-mo entered the historical records when trying to sell the last 80 acres of Caldwell's Reserve in Chicago. ==Indian removal== Pierre- Jean De Smet's map of the Council Bluffs, Iowa area, 1839. The area labeled 'Caldwell's Camp' was a Potawatomi village led by Sauganash. The later town of Kanesville, the precursor of Council Bluffs, grew up in that place.Whittaker (2008): \\"Pierre-Jean De Smet's Remarkable Map of the Missouri River Valley, 1839: What Did He See in Iowa?\\", Journal of the Iowa Archeological Society 55:1-13. In 1835, Caldwell and his band of Potawatomi left the State of Illinois and relocated in Platte County, Missouri. In 1836, as a result of the Platte Purchase, Caldwell and his band were removed from this reservation to Trader's Point on the east bank of the Missouri River in the Iowa Territory. The Potawatomi band of an estimated 2000 individuals settled in a main village called \\"Caldwell's Camp\\", located where the later city of Council Bluffs, Iowa developed. (This was on the eastern bank of the river, opposite the present- day city of Omaha, Nebraska.) From 1838 to 1839, Caldwell and his people were ministered to by the notable Belgian Jesuit missionary Pierre-Jean De Smet, based in St. Louis, Missouri. The Jesuit priest was appalled at the violence and desperation that overtook the Potawatomi in their new home, in large part due to the whiskey trade. After De Smet returned to St. Louis, the Catholic mission was abandoned by 1841.Mullen, Frank (1925), \\"Father De Smet and the Pottawattamie Indian Mission\\", Iowa Journal of History and Politics 23:192-216.Wilson and Fiske (1888) Appleton's Cyclopaedia of American Biography, p. 403.Fulton (1882) Caldwell died on September 28, 1841; scholars believe it may have been from cholera. His wife Masaqua died in the winter of 1843. Together they had one surviving son, Pe-y-mo. Pe-y-mo married and had his own family, and they lived for some time with the Kickapoo in Kansas. In the late nineteenth century, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. ==Legacy and honors== *The Sauganash Hotel in Chicago in 1831 was named after Caldwell. *He was awarded a 1600-acre reserve on the Chicago River, including the confluence of the three tributaries of the North Branch of the Chicago River, which he started selling off in 1833. Eighty acres of the reserve were never sold, and this portion is now part of the Cook County Forest Preserve, including the Billy Caldwell Golf Course,https://billycaldwell.forestpreservegolf.com/ which borders on Caldwell Avenue (also named after him). *Another part of Billy Caldwell's 1600-acre reserve is now the Sauganash residential neighborhood on Chicago's far north side *His son Pe-y-mo married and had a family. *There is a Sauganash Golf Club in Three Rivers, MI., named after him.

It was originally designed to be used to break through German defenses of the Siegfried Line, and was later considered as a possible participant in the planned invasion of the Japanese mainland. The 100-ton vehicle was initially designated a heavy tank. It was re-designated as the 105 mm Gun Motor Carriage T95 in 1945, and then renamed in 1946 as the Super Heavy Tank T28. Only two prototypes were built before the project was terminated. ==Name== Initially named Heavy Tank T28 when construction was authorized in 1944, the design did not fit in the usual categories of vehicles leading to reclassification.Hunnicutt p. 61 As it did not have its armament in a revolving turret, Ordnance requested a name change to 105 mm Gun Motor Carriage T95, the change becoming official in March 1945.Hunnicutt p. 62 However, due to its heavy armor and armament‚Äîwhile self- propelled guns in United States service were lightly armored‚Äîit was renamed Super Heavy Tank T28 in June 1946 by OCM 37058.Hunnicutt p. 65 ==Development== The T28/T95 was designed to be used for attacking the heavy defenses expected of the German Siegfried Line. The 105mm T5E1 gun selected was known to have very good performance against concrete and \\"expected to be extremely effective at reducing heavy fortifications\\" After the vehicle passed trials, the German Siegfried Line had already been infiltrated and overwhelmed by the allied forces, so the designers decided to have the T28/T95 tanks to fight on the Japanese mainland later in the war. Japan surrendered before the tank was able to be transported overseas. The need for an assault tank was first identified in 1943, Ordnance proposing that 25 vehicles could be ready for operations. A conference in March 1944 between Ordnance Department and Army Ground Forces resulted in agreement to build five. The Pacific Car and Foundry Company were supplied with the design in March 1945, completed final design and had the first hull welded by August.Hunnicutt p. 61‚Äì62 By the time the first tank was completed and ready for combat, the war was over. The plan for five was reduced to two. As it did not have a turret, but a fixed casemate mount instead for its main armament (as German Jagdpanzers and Soviet Samokhodnaya Ustanovka-designation combat vehicles did), and the 105 mm gun fitted could only elevate from 19.5¬∞ to ‚àí5¬∞ and traverse from 10¬∞ right to 11¬∞ left of the centerline, the T28/T95 more closely resembled a self-propelled gun, and was redesignated as \\"T95 Gun Motor Carriage\\" in 1945, but in June 1946, the vehicle was redesignated again as \\"Super Heavy Tank T28\\". Two prototypes of the T28 were built. They underwent evaluation at the Aberdeen Proving Ground and Fort Knox facilities until 1947. In 1947, one of the T28s was heavily damaged by an engine fire during trials at Yuma Proving Ground and was broken up and sold for scrap. The T28 never went into service due to the obsolete design, expensive maintenance costs, and the heavy weight, which prevented it from being transported across seas, but was retained to test the \\"durability of components on such a heavy vehicle\\". Work on it ended before completion as the War Department decided to stop the development of vehicles of that sort of weightHunnicutt p. 65‚Äì66 and the T28 program terminated in October 1947. By that point, the T29 and T30 turreted heavy tank designs had been built. The T29 mounted the same gun as the T28 in a conventional rotating turret. The T30 was developed with a larger-caliber gun and more powerful engine. The T29 program was used to test mechanical components for future tank designsHunnicutt p. 74 == Surviving vehicle == In 1974, the last prototype was discovered abandoned in a field at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Camouflaged in the middle of some bushes, it is unknown where it spent the intervening 27 years. It is the sole remaining example of these tanks and was exhibited at the Patton Museum of Cavalry and Armor in Kentucky.Patton Museum List of Exhibits In 2011, it was shipped to its new home at Fort Benning, Georgia. It was placed in the new Patton Park, which is a plot of 30 acres where all of the tanks being stored at Fort Benning are now displayed.http://www.army.mil/article/109642/Pattons__Park_to_display_9_vehicles/ Unfortunately, the vehicle was damaged in January 2017 during transit to another facility for external refurbishment when it broke loose from the M1070 HET carrying it. The transporter failed to negotiate a downhill slope and subsequent turn at a safe speed, causing the securing chains to break and allowing the T28 to slide off the trailer. Despite then rolling into a ditch, only minor repairable damage was sustained to two bogies. The outer track units had been removed. == Design == Side view Closeup of T28 Super Heavy Tank showing the double tracks. The mechanical superstructure was taken from a T23. The original plan was to build five prototype vehicles, with a production total of 25. Its total weight when fully equipped would have reached 95 short tons (86 tonnes). To lower ground pressure, instead of two tracks, it used four tracks that projected forward of the hull, each 23 inches (584 mm) wide. The outer tracks could be detached within two hours for rail transport: After removal, they could be fixed together to make a unit that could be towed behind the tank. Due to its extreme weight and low engine power, the T28 had extremely limited obstacle-crossing ability and could not cross any of the portable bridges available at the time, and so was considered impractical in the field and not suitable for production. The T28 had no conventional turret, with a casemate style hull instead, giving it a comparatively low profile, as the later examples of the fully enclosed Jagdpanzer-family of German tank destroyers, not entirely dissimilar to the 50 short-ton weight German Jagdpanther. Its main armament was a 105 mm T5E1 gun, in a ball-shaped gun mantlet set into the vertical hull front. The traverse was limited to 10¬∞ right and 11¬∞ left, and elevation from 19.5¬∞ to ‚àí5¬∞. When traveling, the gun was locked at the maximum elevation. The only other armament was a .50 cal. (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine gun on a ring mount above the commander's hatch for anti-aircraft use.Hunnicutt p. 196 The main gun‚Äî65 calibres long‚Äîhad a muzzle velocity of 3,700 feet per second (1,130 m/s), with a range of up to 12 miles (19 km).Hunnicutt p. 69 The armor was very thick compared to other tanks of the time, up to 12 inches (305 mm) thick on the front. This was considered heavy enough to provide protection from the German 88 mm gun used as tank and anti-tank guns. The lower hull front had 5.25 in (130 mm) of armor, and the sides 2.5 in (64 mm). The suspension system and lower hull were covered with 4-in (100 mm) thick steel skirts. The engine was a gasoline-powered Ford GAF V-8, delivering 500 hp, at 2600 rpm through the Torqmatic transmission; which left the vehicle underpowered, geared down to a top speed of about 8 mph (13 km/h) and greatly limited its obstacle-climbing capability.Hunnicutt p. 64 ==See also== *List of U.S. military vehicles by model number *Tank classification *Jagdtiger ‚Äì a comparable German vehicle for anti-tank use.

Seeing Billie Holiday perform in 1951 began his interest in a music-industry career. Moving to Los Angeles at the age of 15, he went to Los Angeles High School, where he majored in music and sang in an a cappella choir. Graduating with honors in 1954, he won a scholarship to the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music, where he studied opera, leaving after a year and then attending Los Angeles Junior College.Scott Albin, \\"Joe Lee Wilson Speaks in 1974\\" , JazzTimes, July 31, 2011.

Relocating to New York in 1962, he worked with Sonny Rollins, Lee Morgan, Miles Davis, Pharoah Sanders, Freddie Hubbard, and Jackie McLean. During the 1970s, Wilson operated a jazz performance loft in New York's NoHo district known as the Ladies' Fort at 2 Bond Street. His regular band, Joe Lee Wilson Plus 5, featured the alto saxophonist Monty Waters (from Modesto, California) and for several years the Japanese guitarist Ryo Kawasaki, before the latter left to lead his own group. Archie Shepp and Eddie Jefferson were frequent collaborators at these sessions. He also sang with Eddie Jefferson, Freddie Hubbard, and Kenny Dorham. He recorded a live radio program at WKCR-FM, Columbia University, on July 16, 1972, which was released as an album, Livin' High Off Nickels & Dimes, on the short-lived Oblivion Records in New York.

The term originates from the Middle Greek slavos/sklavenos (Slav), which in Hispano-Arabic came to designate first Slavic slaves and then, similarly to the semantic development of the term in other West-European languages, foreign slaves in general. The word is often misused to refer only to slaves from Central and Eastern Europe, but it refers to all Europeans and others traded by the Arab traders during the war or peace periods. There were several major routes for the trading of Slavic slaves into the Arab world: through Central Asia (Mongols, Tatars, Khazars, etc.) for the East Slavs; through the Balkans for the South Slavs; through Central and Western Europe for the West Slavs and to al-Andalus. The Volga trade route and other European routes, according to Ibrahim ibn Jakub (10th century), were serviced by Radanite Jewish merchants. (Compare Crimean‚ÄìNogai raids into East Slavic lands.) Theophanes mentions that the Umayyad caliph Muawiyah I settled a whole army of 5,000 Slavic mercenaries in Syria in the 660s. In the Arab world, Saqaliba served or were forced to serve in a multitude of ways: as servants, harem concubines, eunuchs, craftsmen, soldiers, and as Caliph's guards. In Iberia, Morocco, Damascus and Sicily, their military role may be compared with that of mamluks in the Ottoman Empire. In al-Andalus, Slavic eunuchs were so popular and widely distributed that they became synonymous with SaqƒÅliba. The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery: A-K ; Vol. II, L-Z, by Junius P.

For example, MujƒÅhid al- øƒÄmirƒ´ organized the Saqaliba in D√©nia to rebel, seize control of the city, and establish the Taifa of D√©nia (1010-1227), which extended its reach as far as the island of Majorca. ==Usage== *Geographer Ibn Khordadbeh (840‚Äì880) claimed that the Bulgar ruling title was \\"King of the SaqƒÅliba\\" prior to the mid 7th century, meaning that the ruler held \\"a reservoir of potential slaves\\". *Traveller Ibn Fadlan (fl. 921‚Äì22) called the ruler of Volga Bulgaria the \\"King of the Saqaliba\\". *Polymath Abu Zayd al-Balkhi (850‚Äì934) described three main centers of the Saqaliba: Kuyaba, Slawiya, and Artania. *Traveller Ibrahim ibn Yaqub ( 961‚Äì62) placed the SaqƒÅliba, Slavs, west of Bulgaria and east of other Slavs, in a mountainous land, and described them as violent and aggressive.

He served as Governing Mayor of Berlin (West Berlin) from 1966 to 1967. ==Life== Heinrich Albertz was born in Breslau (present-day Wroc≈Çaw, Poland), in the Prussian province of Silesia, to the court preacher and consistorial councilor Hugo Albertz and his second wife Elisabeth, n√©e Meinhof. His elder half brother was the Resistance fighter Martin Albertz. Having obtained his baccalaureate (Abitur) in 1933, he went on to study theology at the universities of Breslau, Halle and Berlin. Under the Nazi regime, he maintained contact to circles of the banned Social Democratic Party. As a member of the Confessing Church opposing the Nazis, he showed solidarity with the imprisoned pastor Martin Niem√∂ller, was arrested several times and finally conscripted into the Wehrmacht in 1941. After World War II Albertz moved to Celle, where the British occupation authorities entrusted him with the reception of expellees and displaced persons. He joined the SPD and in 1946 became a member of the Landtag of Lower Saxony. In 1948 he was appointed minister for expellee affairs in the Lower Saxon state cabinet under Minister- President Hinrich Wilhelm Kopf; in 1951 he became state minister of social affairs. Since 1950 he was also a member of the SPD federal board. He was a Christian pacifist and opposed the production and placement of nuclear weapons on German soil. When the Kopf cabinet was succeeded by the right-wing government of Minister-President Heinrich Hellwege upon the 1955 state elections, Albertz continued his career as a state secretary under the West Berlin mayor Otto Suhr. In 1961 he became Senator (minister) of the Interior under Mayor Willy Brandt and deputy mayor in 1963. When Brandt joined the German grand coalition government of Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Albertz succeeded him and was elected governing mayor of West Berlin by the Abgeordnetenhaus parliament on 14 December 1966. Albertz, standing in the shadow of his popular predecessor, led the Social Democrats into the following state election held on 12 March 1967. Nevertheless, the SPD was able to maintain its absolute majority. Albertz' term in office was characterized by the rising student revolts culminating during the state visit by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and his wife Farah Pahlavi. On 2 June 1967 Pahlavi was received in West Berlin, accompanied by violent clashes of protesters with Iranian secret police collaborators and massive police forces, whereby the student Benno Ohnesorg was shot by police officer Karl-Heinz Kurras, an incident that became a turning point in the devolution of the German student movement. On 28 September Mayor Albertz was forced to resign after an investigation into the police's role in the killing. The Abgeordnetenhaus elected Klaus Sch√ºtz his successor. From 1970 he worked as a pastor, from 1974 to 1979 in Berlin- Zehlendorf. When on 27 February 1975 the Movement 2 June militant group (named after the obit of Benno Ohnesorg) abducted the Christian Democrat candidate for Mayor of West Berlin Peter Lorenz, Albertz agreed to accompany the exchanged prisoners, among them Verena Becker and Gabriele Kr√∂cher-Tiedemann, on their flight to South Yemen. Retired in 1979, he joined the German peace movement of the 1980s and several protests against the NATO Double-Track Decision. Albertz died in a Bremen nursing home on 18 May 1993. == See also == ==References== ==External links== * Category:1915 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Lutheran pacifists Category:Clergy from Wroc≈Çaw Category:20th-century German Protestant theologians Category:Social Democratic Party of Germany politicians Category:Mayors of Berlin Category:Senators of Berlin Category:Members of the Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin Category:People from the Province of Silesia Category:Grand Crosses with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:German male non-fiction writers ","title":"Heinrich Albertz"},{"id":"1271237","text":"The Front is a 1976 comedy-drama film set against the Hollywood blacklist in the 1950s. It was written by Walter Bernstein, directed by Martin Ritt, and stars Woody Allen and Zero Mostel. Several people involved in the making of the film‚Äîincluding screenwriter Bernstein, director Ritt, and actors Mostel, Herschel Bernardi, and Lloyd Gough‚Äîhad been blacklisted. (The name of each in the closing credits is followed by \\"Blacklisted 19--\\" and the relevant year.) Bernstein was listed after being named in the Red Channels journal that identified alleged Communists and Communist sympathizers. Because of the blacklist, a number of artists, writers, directors and others were rendered unemployable, having been accused of subversive political activities in support of Communism or of being Communists themselves. ==Plot== In New York City, 1953, at the height of the anti-Communist investigations of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), television screenwriter Alfred Miller is blacklisted and cannot get work. He asks his friend Howard Prince, a restaurant cashier and small-time bookie, to sign his name to Miller's television scripts in exchange for ten percent of the money Miller makes from them, i.e. to serve as a \\"front\\" for Miller. Howard agrees out of friendship and because he needs the money. The scripts are submitted to network producer Phil Sussman, who is pleased to have a writer not on the television blacklist. Howard's script also offers a plum role for Hecky Brown, one of Sussman's top actors. Howard becomes such a success that Miller's two fellow screenwriter friends hire him to be their front too. The quality of the scripts and Howard's ability to write so many impresses Florence Barrett, Susser's idealistic script editor, who mistakes him for a principled artist. Howard begins dating her but changes the subject whenever she wants to discuss his work. As investigators expose and blacklist Communists in the entertainment industry, Hecky Brown is fired from the show because six years earlier he marched in a May Day parade and subscribed to The Daily Worker, although he tells the investigators he did it merely to impress a woman he wanted to lay. In order to clear his name from the blacklist, Hecky is instructed to find out more about Howard Prince's involvement with the Communist Party, so he invites him to the Catskills, where Hecky is booked to perform on stage. The club owner short-changes Hecky on his promised salary, and when Hecky confronts him, the club owner fires him, denouncing him as a \\"communist son of a bitch\\". The professional humiliation and the inability to provide for his wife and children take their toll on Hecky and he kills himself by jumping out of a hotel window. Howard witnesses other harsh results of the investigative actions of the communist-hunting \\"Freedom Information Services\\" on the network's programming. Suspicion is cast his way, and he is called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. He privately tells Florence that he is not a writer, just a humble cashier. Howard decides that he will respond to the Committee's questions evasively, enabling him to neither admit nor deny anything. After briefly enduring the HUAC questioning ‚Äì including being asked to speak ill of the dead Hecky Brown, and being threatened with legal consequences for his admission of having placed bets in his capacity as a bookie (which is illegal), Howard takes a stand, telling the Committee that he does not recognize their authority to ask him such questions, and telling them to \\"go fuck yourselves\\" before leaving the interrogation room. The film ends as Howard is taken away in handcuffs, with Florence kissing him good-bye and many protesters cheering him on. ==Cast== * Woody Allen as Howard Prince * Zero Mostel as Hecky Brown * Herschel Bernardi as Phil Sussman * Michael Murphy as Alfred Miller * Andrea Marcovicci as Florence Barrett * Remak Ramsay as Francis X. Hennessey * Marvin Lichterman as Myer Prince * Lloyd Gough as Herbert Delaney * David Margulies as William Phelps ==Reception== The film's screenwriter, Walter Bernstein (right), during a June 2016 Q&A; with Sony Pictures Classics co-founder Michael Barker (left) at the SVA Theater in Manhattan, which followed a screening of the film ===Critical response=== Critical reception of The Front was divided between those who thought it effectively and amusingly dealt with the topic of McCarthyism and those who thought it a superficial gloss instead of a pithy statement about the McCarthy era. In 1976, reviewing it for The New York Times, Vincent Canby acknowledged the film's lack of direct political commentary: \\"The Front is not the whole story of an especially unpleasant piece of American history. It may be faulted for oversimplification. Mr. Ritt and Mr. Bernstein, veterans of the blacklist are not interested in subtleties. Yet, even in its comic moments, The Front works on the conscience. \\"It recreates the awful noise of ignorance that can still be heard.\\" (Canby, 1976)Canby, Vincent (October 1, 1976). \\"Screen: Woody Allen Is Serious in 'Front'\\". The New York Times. Pauline Kael wrote in praise of the film and the performance of Woody Allen in particular: \\"At its most appealing, this movie says that people shouldn't be pressured to inform on their friends, that people shouldn't be humiliated in order to earn a living. Humbly, this film asks for fairness...When you see Woody Allen in one of his own films, in a peculiar way you take him for granted; here you appreciate his skill, because you miss him so much when he's offscreen.\\"Kael, Pauline (April 1980). When the Lights Go Down. Henry Holt & Co. Reprinted from The New Yorker. Roger Ebert dismissed the political value of The Front: \\"What we get are the adventures of a schlemiel in wonderland\\". He felt that the Woody Allen character was too comic and unconvincing a writer to represent the true nature of \\"front\\" writers. He added that Hecky Brown was a worthwhile character: \\"The tragedy implied by this character tells us what we need to know about the blacklist's effect on people's lives; the rest of the movie adds almost nothing else\\".Ebert, Roger (October 22, 1976). \\"The Front\\". rogerebert.com. As of May 2020, The Front holds a rating of 71% on Rotten Tomatoes from 24 reviews.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/front ===Accolades=== For The Front, Walter Bernstein was nominated for the 1977 Academy Award for Writing Original ScreenplayHollywood's Darkest Moment: An evening with blacklisted screenwriter Walter Bernstein and a special 40th anniversary screening of 'The Front'. Oscars.org website and Zero Mostel was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor. Andrea Marcovicci was nominated for the 1977 \\"Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year ‚Äì Actress\\". ==Historical basis== The movie draws from real life incidents in its depiction of the characters. A scene in which Hecky (played by Mostel) goes to entertain at a mountain resort, and then is cheated out of part of his fee, is based on an incident described by Bernstein in his memoirs Inside Out: A Memoir of the Blacklist. In the book, Bernstein describes how Mostel came to entertain at the Concord Hotel in the Catskills, where he used to entertain as a rising comic because he desperately needed the money. The manager of the Concord promised him $500, but when he arrived, reduced that to $250, according to Bernstein. In the movie, Hecky has a violent scene when, after the performance, he learns he has been cheated. In real life, Mostel was told before the performance and acted out his hostility during the performance by cursing at the customers, who thought it was part of the act. Hecky Brown, and his suicide, was based on blacklisted actor Philip Loeb, a personal friend of Mostel who was investigated by HUAC and fired from his leading role in the television series The Goldbergs in 1951.Quin, Eleanor \\"The Front\\". Turner Classic Movies. He committed suicide in 1955. Mostel personally was motivated to participate in the project because he wanted to educate future generation of Americans. As he pointed out in his biography by Jared Brown, \\"It's part of this country, and a lot of kids don't even realize that blacklisting ever existed.\\" An informal collective of the blacklisted writers Bernstein, Arnold Manoff and Abraham Polonsky is portrayed in an early scene in which the Murphy character, modeled on Bernstein, introduces the Allen character to two other blacklisted writers. == Musical adaptation == In 2008, a musical adaptation of The Front had a workshop in New York City. The musical, also titled The Front (or, alternatively, Lucky Break) had music and lyrics by Paul Gordon and Jay Gruska, with a book and additional lyrics by Seth Friedman, and its workshop was co-directed by John Caird and Nell Balaban, starring Brian d'Arcy James as Howard Prince, Richard Kind as Hecky Brown, and Jayne Paterson as Florence Barrett. ==See also== * List of American films of 1976 ==ReferencesNilan, Jack. \\"McCarthyism and the Movies\\". jacknilan.com Category:1976 films Category:1976 comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Dave Grusin Category:Films about McCarthyism Category:Films about the Hollywood blacklist Category:Films about television Category:American films based on actual events Category:Films directed by Martin Ritt Category:Films set in 1953 Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films with screenplays by Walter Bernstein Category:Suicide in film Category:1976 comedy films Category:1976 drama films ","title":"The Front"},{"id":"1271242","text":"Eugen Albori Eugen Freiherr von Albori (or also known as Baron Eugen von Albori), (27 September 1838 ‚Äì 4 September 1915) was an Austrian administrator.

They married in 1621 in Plymouth. ==Biography== Miles Standish Burial Ground, the final resting place of John and Priscilla Alden Priscilla was most likely born in Dorking in Surrey, the daughter of William and step-daughter of Alice Mullins. She was just eighteen when she boarded the Mayflower. She lost her father, step-mother and her brother Joseph during the first winter in Plymouth. She was then the only one of her family in the New World, although she had another brother and a sister who remained in England. John Alden and Priscilla Mullins were probably the third couple to be married in Plymouth Colony. William Bradford's marriage to Alice Carpenter on August 14, 1623 is known to be the fourth.The Mayflower Descendant, vol. 30:4. The first was that of Edward Winslow and Susannah White in 1621. Francis Eaton's marriage to his second wife Dorothy, maidservant to the Carvers, was possibly the second. Priscilla is last found in the records in 1650, but oral tradition states that she died only a few years before her husband (which would be about 1680). She lies buried at the Miles Standish Burial Ground in Duxbury, Massachusetts. The exact location of her grave is unknown, but there is a marker honoring her. ==Longfellow's poem== A scene from Longfellow's The Courtship of Miles Standish, showing Standish looking upon Alden and Mullins during the bridal procession She is known to literary history as the unrequited love of newly widowed Captain Miles Standish, the colony's military advisor, in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1858 poem The Courtship of Miles Standish. According to the poem, Standish asked his good friend John Alden to propose to Priscilla on his behalf, only to have Priscilla ask, \\"Why don't you speak for yourself, John?\\" Longfellow was a direct descendant of John and Priscilla, and based his poem on a romanticized version of a family tradition although, until recently, there was little independent historical evidence for the account. The basic story was apparently handed down in the Alden family and published by John and Priscilla's great-great-grandson Rev. Timothy Alden in 1814.Timothy Alden, Collection of American Epitaphs and Inscriptions, vol.3, pp. 264-271. Scholars have recently confirmed the cherished place of romantic love in Pilgrim culture,Bruce C. Daniels, Puritans at Play, 1995. and have documented the Indian war described by Longfellow.Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower, 2006. Circumstantial evidence of the love triangle also exists. Miles Standish and John Alden were likely roommates;John A. Goodwin, The Pilgrim Republic, 1915. Priscilla Mullins was the only single woman of marriageable age. The families of the alleged lovers remained close for several generations, moving together to Duxbury, Massachusetts in the late 1620s.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2006. ==The Alden children== Priscilla and John Alden had ten children, with a possible eleventh dying in infancy. It is presumed, although not documented, that the first three children were born in Plymouth, the remainder in Duxbury.Zachariah Alden and Henry Alden have both been incorrectly identified as sons of John Alden and Priscilla Mullins in various publications. For information on the genealogy of Henry Alden, see Mayflower Descendant 43:21‚Äì29, 133‚Äì138; 44:27‚Äì30, 181‚Äì184. The children were: # Elizabeth. (1624/25‚Äì1717). Married William Pabodie (Peabody), a civic and military leader of Duxbury, where all thirteen of their children were born. They moved to Little Compton, Rhode Island, where Elizabeth died in 1717 at the age of about ninety-four. Their descendants were prominent in settling areas of Rhode Island and Connecticut. From Elizabeth's line comes the individual most credited with spreading the fame of John and Priscilla far and wide, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in his Courtship of Miles Standish. # John (1626‚Äì1701). Moved to Boston and married there Elizabeth (Phillips) Everill, widow of Abiel Everill. They had thirteen children. He was a mariner and became a naval commander of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He was a member of the Old South Church of Boston and his ancient slate headstone is embedded in the wall there. Perhaps the best known event of his life was when he was accused of witchcraft on a trip to Salem, spending fifteen weeks in a Boston jail. He escaped shortly before nine of the other victims were executed during the Salem witch trials. Alden was later exonerated. # Joseph. (1627‚Äì1697) Moved to Bridgewater where he was a farmer on land purchased earlier from the Indians by his father and Myles Standish. He married Mary Simmons. They had a total of seven children. Joseph died sometime after. # Sarah. Her marriage to Myles Standish's son Alexander undercuts any idea of a long-standing feud between the Aldens and the Standish clan. In fact, there is much evidence to suggest that John and Myles remained lifelong friends or, at the minimum, associates. Sarah and Alexander lived in Duxbury until Sarah's death sometime before June 1688. (Alexander subsequently married Desire Doty, a twice-widowed daughter of Pilgrim Edward Doty.) They had seven or possibly eight children. Their home Alexander Standish House in Duxbury still stands. # Jonathan. Married Abigail Hallett, December 10, 1672. Lived in Duxbury until his death February 14, 1697. He was the second owner of the Alden House which he received from his father. The house then passed to his own son John, one of his six children. At his funeral oration, Jonathan was described as \\"a sincere Christian, one whose heart was in the house of God even when his body was barred hence by restraints of many difficulties which confined him at home.\\" # Ruth. Married John Bass of Braintree, Massachusetts, where they lived and had seven children. Of the more illustrious descendants of this union came Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams. Ruth died on October 12, 1674. # Rebecca. Married Thomas Delano of Duxbury by 1667, a son of Philip Delanoye, one of the original settlers of Duxbury. They had nine children. Died in Duxbury sometime after June 13, 1688. # Mary. Married Deacon Samuel Allen, a union that produced at least one son, Joseph. Mary died in 1688. Joseph would go on to have several children of his own. # Priscilla. No record of offspring or marriage. # David. Married Mary Southworth, daughter of Constant Southworth of Plymouth Colony. Died sometime during 1718 or 1719. Six children.

It was syndicated from December 1975 to June 1978 and later as part of the Krofft Superstars show from 1978 to 1985. ==Plot== The show centered on two brothers named Johnny and Scott Stuart. While playing on the beach near Dead Man's Point, the two of them discover a friendly young sea monster named Sigmund who had been thrown out by his comically dysfunctional undersea family for refusing to frighten people. The boys hide Sigmund in their clubhouse. Sigmund, Scott and Johnny in the program's 1973 premiere episode, 1973. Plotlines were very simple and straightforward, usually some variation on the idea of Sigmund doing something silly to arouse attention, and the boys working to prevent him from being found by Sigmund's brothers Blurp and Slurp who want Sigmund to scare people in order to impress their parents Sweet Mama Ooze and Big Daddy Ooze. The brothers also worked to hide Sigmund from their overbearing housekeeper Zelda, elderly neighbor Mrs. Eldels, and Sheriff Chuck Bevans. Strangely, the parents were never seen on the show, nor did they return home by the end of the series. The episodes included songs as part of the plot development. The character(s), generally Johnny, would sing a song about what he was thinking or feeling about something going on in his life, from things that made him happy to anxiety about girls. While videotaping the first episode of Season Two, a hot light fell and started a fire. No one was injured, but the fire destroyed all of the sets and much of the costumes and other props. Most of Season Two was taped with minimal sets. ==Characters== ===Main characters=== * Sigmund Ooze (performed by Billy Barty, voiced by Walker Edmiston) - A sea monster who was kicked out of his family for not being able to scare a human. * Johnny and Scott Stuart (portrayed by Johnny Whitaker and Scott Kolden) - Two brothers who discovered Sigmund when they were playing at the beach ===Ooze Family=== The Ooze Family are a family of sea monsters that live out at Dead Man's Point. They kicked Sigmund out after he wouldn't scare a human. Most episodes would have them trying to harm Johnny and Scott to no avail. The Ooze Family consists of: * Sweet Mama Ooze (performed by Van Snowden, voiced by Sidney Miller) - The matriarch of the Ooze family. Sweet Mama's characterization was based loosely on Phyllis Diller. * Big Daddy Ooze (performed by Sharon Baird, voiced by Walker Edmiston) - The patriarch of the Ooze family. Big Daddy was a spoof of Archie Bunker from All in the Family. In the sixth episode of the first season, he is identified as \\"Melvin Ooze\\" by a tax collector. * Blurp Ooze (performed by Bill Germaine and Larry Larsen, voiced by Walker Edmiston) - A brother of Sigmund. Blurp's voice characterization was based loosely on that of the fictional character Gomer Pyle. * Slurp Ooze (performed by Fred Spencer and Paul Gale, voiced by Walker Edmiston) - A brother of Sigmund. * Prince - The Ooze family's pet lobster who acts like the family dog. ===Humans=== * Zelda (portrayed by Mary Wickes) - The overbearing housekeeper who watches over Johnny and Scott. * Mrs. Eldels (portrayed by Margaret Hamilton) - The elderly neighbor of Johnny and Scott. * Chuck Bevans (portrayed by Joe Higgins) - The local sheriff. * Gertrude (portrayed by Fran Ryan) - A housekeeper who briefly replaced Zelda during the second season. Gertrude was a tough USMC drill instructor. The boys were relieved when Zelda returned after Gertrude was scared away by the house being \\"haunted.\\" ===Other characters=== * Sheldon (portrayed by Rip Taylor) - A magical \\"Sea Genie\\" who lives in a shell that debuted during the second season. Unfortunately, Sheldon was a bumbler and his \\"whammy\\" spells seldom worked properly. * Shelby (portrayed by Sparky Marcus) - A Sea Genie who is Sheldon's nephew. ==Music== The songs for the show were co-written by Danny Janssen, Bobby Hart and Wes Farrell. A cover of the show's theme song, performed by Tripping Daisy, is included on the 1995 tribute album Saturday Morning: Cartoons' Greatest Hits, produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records. ===Album=== Eleven songs from the show were released on Johnny Whitaker's album Friends (Music from the Television Series 'Sigmund and the Sea Monsters') (Chelsea Records, BCL1-0332). All songs written by Danny Janssen and Bobby Hart, except where noted. ===Side 1=== # \\"Friends\\" (Janssen, Hart, Farrell) # \\"Keep It a Secret\\" # \\"A Simple Song\\" # \\"The Magician\\" # \\"Monster Rock\\" (Janssen, Hart, Farrell) # \\"It's Up to You\\" ===Side 2=== # \\"Can't Get You Off My Mind\\" # \\"Running 'Round in Circles\\" # \\"Lovin' Ain't Easy\\" # \\"Sigmund and the Sea Monsters\\" # \\"Day and Night\\" ==Production== Sigmund and the Sea Monsters was the first Krofft Saturday morning production that was produced for more than one season. Previous entries H.R. Pufnstuf (1969), The Bugaloos (1970), and Lidsville (1971) were in production with new episodes for only a single season. Sigmund, however, did not follow the \\"stranger in a strange land\\" premise as many of the previous Krofft shows had done. Other Krofft shows which did not follow the premise were The Bugaloos, Bigfoot and Wildboy, Pryor's Place and Wonderbug. Costumes were created by Oliver Soublette. One episode features an appearance by H.R. Pufnstuf and another that features Jack Wild (who had played Jimmy on H.R. Pufnstuf). The series was created and produced by Sid & Marty Krofft and Si Rose. ==Episodes== ===Season 1 (1973)=== ===Season 2 (1974)=== ==Home release== In the United States, the first season of the show was released on DVD in 2005 by Rhino Entertainment, featuring all 17 original broadcast episodes, uncut and digitally remastered.

(Catalan: Josep Sadoc Alemany i Conill; Spanish: Jos√© Sadoc Alemany y Conill; July 3, 1814 ‚Äì April 14, 1888) was a Spanish Roman Catholic archbishop and missionary. He served as the first Bishop of Monterey from 1850 until 1853, and as the first Archbishop of San Francisco from 1853 until 1884. ==Early life== Alemany was born in Vic, Catalonia, on July 3, 1814, to Antoni Alemany i Font and Miquela dels Sants i Saborit. Alemany entered the Dominican Order in 1830 and made his solemn profession of religious vows in September 1831, the same year that his prot√©g√©, Patrick Manogue was born in Ireland. He was then sent to Rome to study at the College of St. Thomas in Rome, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, commonly referred to as the Angelicum, where in 1840 he was made Lector in Theology.\\"Upon the completion of his studies, he was awarded the degree of Lectorate in Theology at the Minerva, one of the venerable centers of Dominican life and culture.\\"Mission West: The Western Dominican Province 1850-1966, 1995, Western Dominican Province Oakland, California, Accessed 21 May 2014 Alemany was ordained a priest in the cathedral of Viterbo on March 11, 1837 by Archbishop Gaspare Bernardo Pianetti.\\"...on March 11, 1837, though one year shy of the sacerdotal canonical age, he was ordained a priest in San Lorenzo Cathedral in Viterbo by Archbishop (later Cardinal) Gaspar Bernard Pianetti of that city.\\" Mission West: The Western Dominican Province 1850-1966, 1995, Western Dominican Province Oakland, California, Accessed 21 May 2014 During his studies in Rome, he had an audience with Pope Gregory XVI. ==Career== The Dominican superiors sent Alemany to the United States in 1840. For the next eight years, he engaged in missionary activity in the Eastern and Southern United States, eventually becoming a naturalized United States citizen. In 1848, Alemany was appointed Prior Provincial of the Dominican Province of St. Joseph. Summoned to Rome, Alemany met on June 11, 1850, with Cardinal Giacomo Filippo Fransoni, informed of his appointment as Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey in California. Alemany replied, \\"No.\\" Pope Pius IX ordered Alemany to a private audience on June 16. Pope Pius told Alemany, \\"You must go to California....Where others are drawn by gold, you must carry the Cross.\\" Fransoni consecrated Alemany as Bishop of Monterey on June 30, 1850, in Rome; thus, becoming the first American bishop in California.Diocesan History ===Monterey=== Before leaving Europe, Alemany determined that he would need the help of a community of religious women for the education of the children of his new territory. He traveled around, visiting various monasteries of Dominican nuns. When he arrived in Paris, he went to the Monastery of the Cross there, where he presented his request for volunteers among the Dominican Sisters. He had one recruit, Sister Mary of the Cross Goemaere, O.P., a Belgian novice. Alemany soon set sail with her and a fellow Dominican friar, Francis Sadoc Vilarrasa, O.P., arriving in San Francisco on December 6, 1850. Goemaere then founded a community in Monterey which was to become the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael. ===San Francisco=== When the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco was erected July 29, 1853, Alemany was appointed by Pope Pius as its first archbishop. Alemany arrived in San Francisco finding three established Catholic parishes Mission Dolores (San Francisco de As√≠s) (1776), St. Francis of Assisi (1849) and St. Patrick (1851). As Archbishop of San Francisco, Alemany presided over what became a multinational diocese, owing to the influx of people during the California Gold Rush, and parishes were established for San Francisco's Italian, Irish, French, German and Mexican communities.Presentation Sisters to celebrate 150 years Catholic religious institutes were also active during his tenure, with the Society of Jesus establishing Santa Clara University and the University of San Francisco, the De La Salle Christian Brothers taking over the diocesan Saint Mary's College, and the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur establishing in San Jose the Notre Dame de Namur University, and the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary establishing in Oakland the Holy Names University. He and Vilarosa also founded the Dominican Province of the Most Holy Name in 1851, and the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael and Dominican Sisters of Mission San Jose were established in the archdiocese in 1851 and 1876, respectively. As Bishop of Monterey Alemany had filed a petition with the Public Land Commission on February 19, 1853 for the return of all former mission lands in California. As Archbishop of San Francisco he sought Fee Ownership of 1,051.44 acres (for all practical intents being the exact area of land occupied by the original mission buildings, cemeteries, and gardens) was subsequently conveyed to the Church, along with the Ca√±ada de los Pinos (or College Rancho) in Santa Barbara County comprising , and La Laguna in San Luis Obispo County, consisting of .Robinson, pp. 31‚Äì32 The scope of his authority was large, as the Diocese of Monterey originally encompassed the entire area of the former Mexican province of Alta California, while the Archdiocese of San Francisco encompassed all of the state of California north of Monterey Bay as well as territories that would become Nevada and Utah. However, Alemany wished to return to missionary work and requested a coadjutor bishop. In 1883, Bishop Patrick William Riordan was appointed by Pope Leo XIII coadjutor, and would succeed Alemany upon the latter's resignation as archbishop in 1884. ==Retirement== Alemany's vault at Holy Cross After his resignation, Alemany left San Francisco in May 1885 to return to his homeland. In the course of the journey east he toured New York, was presented by Catholic General William Rosecrans to President Grover Cleveland. He arrived in Italy, having an audience with Pope Leo XIII and was appointed titular archbishop of Pelusium. Alemany returned to Catalonia. He died in Valencia, on April 14, 1888, and was buried in the Church of Sant Dom√®nec in his native Vic. In 1965, Alemany's body was brought back to San Francisco after a funeral Mass said by Archbishop Joseph T. McGucken at the Old Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Immaculate Conception his remains were buried in the Archbishops' Crypt in the mausoleum in Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California. He was an author, publishing his The Life of St. Dominick. Alemany Boulevard and the Alemany Maze in San Francisco, Bishop Alemany High School in Mission Hills, California and the Archbishop Alemany Library at Dominican University of California in San Rafael are all named in his honor. ==References== ==Sources== *Mc Gloin, S.J., John B.

Its name, given by the painter Michelangelo da Caravaggio, comes from its similarity in shape to the human ear. The name is also linked to the acoustic effects inside the cave: it is told that people's voices echo up to 16 times. ==Geology== Exterior view within the context of the Archaeological Park. 2012 The Ear of Dionysius was most likely formed out of an old limestone quarry. It is 23 metres high and extends 65 metres back into the cliff. Horizontally, it bends in an approximate \\"S\\" shape, vertically it is tapered at the top like a teardrop. Because of its shape the Ear has extremely good acoustics, making even a small sound resonate throughout the cave. ==Purpose== This cave was dug in Greek/Roman times as a water storage for Syracuse. A narrow tunnel was dug first. This tunnel was widened by digging down and sideways afterwards, giving the cave its unusual shape. The small narrow tunnel is still visible on the top of this artificial cave. An earthquake struck this area causing damage, and the cave became unusable for water storage afterwards. ==History== The name of the cave was coined in 1608 by the painter Caravaggio after mathematician, antiquarian and archaeologist, Vincenzo Mirabella took Caravaggio to visit the grotto. It refers to the tyrant Dionysius I of Syracuse. According to legend (possibly one created by Caravaggio), Dionysius used the cave as a prison for political dissidents, and by means of the perfect acoustics eavesdropped on the plans and secrets of his captives. Another more gruesome legend claims that Dionysius carved the cave in its shape so that it would amplify the screams of prisoners being tortured in it. Unfortunately, the sound focusing effect can no longer be heard because access to the focal point is no longer possible. The visitors of the cave can however still hear the echo while they are in the Ear of Dionysius. Because of its reputation for acoustic flawlessness, the Ear of Dionysius has also come to refer to a type of ear trumpet that has a flexible tube. The term 'Ear of Dionysius' can also refer to surveillance, specifically that for political gain. There is a strong possibility that this feature is actually of natural origin. It lies on the down slope side of a substantial hill it could well be a 'slot' canyon cut by rainwater run-off in prehistoric times. Comparing it to other 'slot' canyons, especially those in the state of Utah (USA), it shows many similar characteristics. The narrowness of the top opening and widening of the lower part are also common to slot caverns elsewhere, as is its serpentine shape. The highly polished sides also suggest that the phenomenon was created by water. Such a natural feature, especially given its acoustics, would have been valued in the ancient world for its supposed sacred properties and this could have led to its preservation. Had it been man-made, why would the 'quarriers' bother to polish its walls to such a high degree, or remove stone in such an impractical fashion? Given that the building of the extensive necropolis that abuts it on the hillside above involved removing a huge amount of the original overlaying rock, it is also possible that this 'canyon' extended even further before men began quarrying there. ==See also== *List of caves *List of caves in Italy ==Notes== ===References=== * ==External links== *Description of acoustics on Sound Tourism site *A guide to visiting the Ear of Dionysius Category:Caves of Italy Category:Archaeological sites in Sicily Category:Buildings and structures in Syracuse, Sicily Category:Ancient Syracuse ","title":"Ear of Dionysius"},{"id":"1271298","text":"Arturo Fortunato Alessandri Palma, GCTE (; December 20, 1868 ‚Äì August 24, 1950) was a Chilean political figure and reformer, who served thrice as the President of Chile, first between 1920 and 1924, then for part of 1925, and finally from 1932 until 1938. ==Early life== He was son of Pedro Alessandri Vargas, son of an Italian immigrant, and Susana Palma Guzm√°n. His father was dedicated to the agricultural labor of the estate in which he lived. At the age of 12 he entered the Sacred Hearts High School, run by French priests, where his brothers were studying and his father had studied. He started his law career by beginning studies at the University of ChileThe International Who's Who 1943-44. 8th edition. George Allen & Unwin, London, 1943, p. 11. at the age of 20, graduating in 1893. In 1891, while studying, he participated in the newspaper \\"La Justicia\\", which was in opposition to the President of the time, Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda. After graduating as a lawyer, he married Rosa Ester Rodr√≠guez Velasco, with whom he had 9 children. He began his political life in 1897, entering the Liberal Party, and assuming the position of representative of Curic√≥, where he would be re-elected for almost 20 years. In 1915, already showing his first presidential aspirations, he challenged the senator of the province of Tarapac√°, Arturo del R√≠o. Alessandri won a disputed and violent election, from where he earned the nickname of Le√≥n de Tarapac√° (Lion of Tarapac√°), due to his charisma, his popularity with the people and his public-speaking abilities. In 1920 he ran for President of the Republic for the Liberal Alliance, defeating by a narrow margin his opponent of the Coalition (now named the National Union since it incorporated the Conservative Party) Luis Barros Borgo√±o. With his speeches favoring the working class, he caused great fear in the more conservative sectors of Chilean society, which saw its interests in jeopardy. Since the opposition controlled the National Congress, Alessandri favored strengthening the executive power, which lacked political weight before the Congress (Parliamentary Era). ==First administration== During most of 1924, Chile had been politically paralyzed by a conflict between the President and the conservatively controlled Congress, who refused to enact the laws that he submitted. On September 3, 1924 a group of 56 military officers protested for their low salaries, in the incident known as the ruido de sables (or \\"saber-rattling\\"). The next day the same group of young military officers led by Colonel Marmaduque Grove and Major Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo, created the \\"military committee\\" to defend themselves from the government. On September 5, the \\"military committee\\" demanded of President Alessandri the dismissal of three of his ministers, including the Minister of War; the enactment of a labor code, the passage of an income tax law, and the improvement of the military salaries. Alessandri had no option but to appoint General Luis Altamirano, the Army Inspector General, as head of a new cabinet. On September 8, General Altamirano appeared in front of Congress to demand the passage of eight laws, including Alessandri's labor code. Congress didn't dare to protest, and the laws were passed in a matter of hours. At that point, Alessandri felt that he had become just a pawn of the military and on September 9, he resigned, and requested asylum at the US Embassy. Congress refused to accept his resignation, and instead granted him a six-month constitutional leave of absence. He left the country immediately for Italy. On September 11, a military Junta -- the September Junta -- was established to rule the country in his absence. ==Second administration== Official portrait of Arturo Alessandri. Arturo Alessandri (sitting in center) together with his Ministers of State, in April 1934. Arturo Alessandri, Gustavo Ross and Ulk The September Junta was not homogeneous, and quickly a progressive wing, headed by Marmaduke Grove and Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo, developed contacts with the Comit√© Obrero Nacional and others labour organizations who advocated for Alessandri's return. This led to a coup in January 1925, directed by Colonel Grove who handed out the power to General Pedro Dartnell as interim president while waiting for Alessandri's return. Dartnell formed the January Junta, before retroceding the power to Alessandri on March 20, 1925. Alessandri had a new Constitution drafted, and approved by plebiscite by 134,421 voters on August 30. The Constitution, which was promulgated on September 18, 1925, reinforced presidential powers over the legislative. Furthermore, Alessandri created a Central Bank, initiating the first rupture with laissez faire policiesIntervenciones militares y poder factico en la politica chilena (de 1830 al 2000) , Luis Vitale, 2000 (p.38) His second government began with the support of left-wing and radical groups. However, this second group began to distance itself from the President. In March 1925, Alessandri's government repressed a demonstration, leading to the Marusia massacre, soon followed by La Coru√±a massacre. This break with the working classes caused him to try to maintain a right-wing-radical alliance until 1937, when it took a turn towards the left. In order to face the threats of a coup, Alessandri relied on the republican forces, entrusted with repressing any intent to revolt and never to get involved in politics. They were created shortly before Alessandri's return, as a consequence of the civil movement. They functioned in secret and then publicly, marching in a great parade May 7, 1933 in front of the President, who saluted them. They auto- disbanded in 1936, having considered their mission complete. The President asked the Parliament on several opportunities for the state of constitutional exception, resulting in illegal actions, such as the famous burning of the Topaze Magazine issue No. 285, which depicted a caricature of Alessandri he considered offensive. That time was also marked by the appearance of new violent occurrences, such as the rural rebellion of R√°nquil and their bloody repression, and the Nazi-inspired National Socialist Movement of Chile of Jorge Gonz√°lez von Mar√©es. In the economic sphere, the recovery of the crisis of 1929 was begun with the work of the Treasury Minister Gustavo Ross, a pragmatic liberal who implemented a \\"towards in\\" approach to growth. With respect to nitrates, he dissolved COSACH and created the COVENSA (Corporation of Nitrate and Iodine Sale), a multi-faceted distributor and not a producer. He balanced the fiscal deficit with new taxes and resumed payment of the external debt, with losses for holders of Chilean bonds. When they reached a surplus, they focused on public works. The construction of the National Stadium in Santiago, inaugurated in December 1938, stands out. His role in the 1938 Seguro Obrero massacre has always been subject of controversy. Two facts favor the evidence of his responsibility: first, the Chilean armes forces are known for their high degree of discipline and would never have carried out such act of violence \\"without orders from above.\\" Second, the massacre took place in a building merely 30 meters away from the presidential palace. The proximity of the massacre to his office and the discipline of the troops strongly suggest that this event was sanctioned from the highest office in the land. ==Public life after the presidency== His political life did not end with his presidency. Due to the death of the communist Senator of Curico, Talca, Linares and Maule, Amador Pairoa, he participated in a complementary Senatorial election and won, returning to the Senate on November 8. In 1949 he was reelected but this time for Santiago, while also chosen to be President of this body. He was of vital importance in the presidential elections of 1942 and 1946, in the first by causing a division of votes of the liberals, supporting Juan Antonio R√≠os, and in the second by presenting himself as a preliminary candidate of the liberals. He later yielded his candidacy to his son Fernando, resulting in the division of the presidential candidates of the right and conservative support for Dr. Eduardo Cruz-Coke, in turn favoring the victory of Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla. While President of the Senate of Chile, Alessandri died at the age of 82, on August 24, 1950, and was replaced by his son Fernando Alessandri. One of his other sons, Jorge Alessandri, was president of Chile from 1958 to 1964. == Honours and Awards == Arms of Arturo Alessandri as knight of the Order of the Dannebrog === Foreign Honours === : * 60x60px Grand Cross with Diamonds of the Order of the Dannebrog (4 October 1937) : * 60x60px Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword (6 July 1925) ==See also== *Alessandri family *San Gregorio massacre *Marusia massacre *La Coru√±a massacre *Seguro Obrero massacre ==References== ==External links== *San Gregorio Massacre * Category:1868 births Category:1950 deaths Category:People from Linares Province Arturo Alessandri Category:Chilean people of Italian descent Category:Chilean Roman Catholics Category:Liberal Party (Chile, 1849) politicians Category:Presidents of Chile Category:Presidents of the Senate of Chile Category:Chilean Ministers of the Interior Category:Chilean Ministers of Public Works Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies of Chile Category:Candidates for President of Chile Category:Members of the Chilean Academy of Language Category:University of Chile alumni Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Dannebrog ","title":"Arturo Alessandri"},{"id":"1271305","text":"Lilliwaup is a small unincorporated community in Mason County, Washington, United States.

Myron Eells American Anthropologist, January, 1892 The area was settled by early pioneers by 1854. The town was officially platted in 1890. The Olympic Exploring Expedition of 1890, led by Joseph O'Neil, made one of the earliest explorations of the Olympic Mountains and the first crossing of the southern part of the range. The expedition began at Lilliwaup, bringing men and supplies up Hood Canal. O'Neil hoped to find a practical route between Hood Canal and the Pacific Ocean. The party left Lilliwaup in June 1890, west to the North Fork Skokomish River and Lake Cushman. From there a number of smaller parties explored in various directions, including one group that made the first recorded ascent of Mount Olympus. The main contingent of the expedition reached Hoquiam in October 1890. O'Neil did not find the practical route he had hoped for, but advocated for the creation of a national park. When O'Neil's exploring expedition first arrived at Lilliwaup in early 1890 they found the town almost non-existent. A member of the party described Lilliwaup as \\"a town with one house\\". But in September of the same year, when O'Neil again traveled to Lake Cushman via Lilliwaup more than 30 families had moved in. Soon after there was a store and two hotels. However, the townsite company went bankrupt a short time later and most of the people moved away. By the 1920s tourism was bringing new life to the region. The Lilliwaup Land and Resort Company was founded. There were reports that movie stars such as Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, and others were interested in buying homes in Lilliwaup, but they never came and the resort company folded. ==Recreation== A nearby fish hatchery keeps the local waters stocked with salmon, which draws fishing enthusiasts to the area in the fall.

Howard was the figurehead of Kirsty's Appeal, a charitable foundation in her name, created to raise ¬£5 million for Francis House, Didsbury, Manchester, the hospice where she received care. Howard took part in numerous fundraising efforts, which gained national support and attention. At the time of her death, she had raised over ¬£7.5 million for the hospice. == Birth and illness == Kirsty Howard was born on 20 September 1995 in Wythenshawe, Manchester to Lynn and Steve Howard. She also had two elder sisters named Zoe and Kim. Howard had an exceptionally rare condition in which her heart was back to front, causing the misplacement of her internal organs. The condition, a form of situs ambiguus, is inoperable, and requires extensive treatment, including a constant oxygen supply. Howard was the only person in the UK, and only the second in the world, diagnosed with this condition. In February 1999, at the age of four years, she was given only six weeks to live but defied the odds. == Later life == In 2001, Howard was the mascot for the 2002 World Cup qualifying match between England and Greece. Commentator John Motson called her \\"the bravest person on the pitch\\", as she accompanied David Beckham onto the pitch with her 20 kg oxygen tank. In 2002, Howard, along with Beckham, presented the Jubilee Baton to Queen Elizabeth II during the opening ceremony of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. Russell Watson released the single \\"Nothing Sacred - A Song for Kirsty\\" in December to help her fundraising and it reached a peak of number 17 in the UK Singles Chart. In 2003, Howard started the inaugural Junior and Mini Great Manchester Run, and took part in the race herself, via wheelchair, wearing the Number 1 vest. She continued to do this throughout the history of the event, even after she became 16 years old, when she was too old to officially take part in the event. She also joined the full 10 km race in her last years, pushed by her team. In 2006, Richard Fleeshman sang for Howard on Soapstar Superstar and donated his ¬£200,000 prize money to The Kirsty Appeal. Howard's new fundraising target was to raise a further ¬£2,000,000 to build an extension to the Francis House hospice. This will not be named after her, but dedicated to her. == Awards and honours == Howard was awarded the Helen Rollason Award by the BBC in 2004, for her courage and determination in her fundraising efforts. She also received the Child of Courage Award (2001) and the Pride of Britain Award (2002). For her efforts in fundraising, Manchester City Council gave Howard their Young Citizen of the Year award in 2007. In recognition of her contributions to her community, Howard was awarded the Diana Award; the certificate given to her by tenor Russell Watson at the secondary school she attended. In September 2014 Howard received an \\"Outstanding Achievement Award\\" from the children's charity Variety. In December 2014 Howard was named 'Ultimate Woman of Courage' by Cosmopolitan magazine. == Death == Howard died on 24 October 2015 at the Manchester Royal Infirmary with her family at her bedside after suffering first a kidney infection and then a heart attack. Her funeral was held on 3 November at St Michael and All Angels Church, Northern Moor. Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral, including a number of celebrities. She is buried at Southern Cemetery, Manchester. == Legacy == A JustGiving page has been set up through the Kirsty Club at https://www.justgiving.com/kirstyclub/.

The killings gained widespread international attention due to Ayat's age and gender and the fact that one of the victims was also a teenage girl. The killings led U.S. President George W. Bush to observe: ‚ÄúWhen an 18-year-old Palestinian girl is induced to blow herself up and in the process kills a 17-year-old Israeli girl, the future itself is dying; the future of the Palestinian people and the future of the Israeli people.‚ÄùHow Two Lives Met In Death ==Childhood and family background== Akhras was raised in the Deheishe Refugee Camp near Bethlehem, the daughter of Palestinian refugees who themselves grew up in a tent camp in the Gaza Strip. According to Newsweek journalist Joshua Hammer, Akhras's parents \\"fled from Arab villages near Tel Aviv at the end of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. After Israel won the 1967 war and took control of Gaza, Akhras' parents migrated to the Dehaishe camp\\", described as \\"a maze of cinder-block buildings, refuse-strewn alleyways and open sewers\\". Akhras' father found employment with an Israeli construction firm and was able to build a three-story concrete house, where Akhras and her four brothers and six sisters were raised. Akhras was a straight-A student and had hopes of attending college and becoming a news reporter. In 2001 she became engaged and plans were made for a wedding in July 2002. ==Radicalization and preparation for violence== During the First Intifada which started in 1987, Akhras' oldest brother was jailed twice for attacking Israeli soldiers. During the Al-Aqsa Intifada or Second Intifada which started in 2000, members of her family were wounded and killed by the Israel Defense Forces. On March 8, 2002, a close friend and neighbor of Akhras that was playing with his toddler was hit by a stray bullet fired by Israeli troops as they were on a counter-terrorism operation.http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/6947200/why-did-ayat-al- akhras-become-suicide-bomber These traumatic experiences may have influenced Akhras' attempts to join one of the Palestinian resistance groups.List of designated terrorist organizations However, Israeli intelligence reports indicate that Akhras was impregnated by a Fatah operative, despite being an unmarried teenager, and that the emotional and social consequences of her unplanned pregnancy were the primary reason she decided to commit a suicide attack.Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Blackmailing Young Women into Suicide Terrorism. 12 February 2002 Akhras first tried to join the ranks of Hamas, which turned her away because of a long-standing policy against allowing females to fight in physical combatcitation needed. Hamas, which has claimed responsibility for many suicide bombings in Israel says that the basis for this rule lies in teachings of the Qur'an that says Jihad is the domain of the male. Despite this, Hamas and the Palestine Islamic Jihad (which generally also only recruits males) have since each used female suicide bombers. In 2002, the spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin made a statement to the press after Akhras' bombing saying that the group would only use women after they ran out of men. However, Akhras found a group that would accept her: the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, a group linked to the armed branch of Fatah (Yasser Arafat's party), more secular than Hamas. The group already had experience, using at least three other women successfully in suicide bombings against Israel before Akhras. She was reportedly trained for several weeks before being sent to Kiryat Yovel, a south-western neighborhood of Jerusalem, to detonate in the supermarket. Before her attack, Akhras, like many other Palestinian suicide bombers, made a video in which she lashed out at the regimes and militaries of Muslim nations throughout the world. She said: \\"I say to the Arab leaders, stop sleeping. Stop failing to fulfill your duty. Shame on the Arab armies who are sitting and watching the girls of Palestine fight while they are asleep.\\" ==Bombing and victims== The entrance to the Kiryat HaYovel supermarket, where Akhras detonated the bomb and killed 2. On March 29, 2002, Ayat al-Akhras was driven to the Kiryat HaYovel supermarket in Jerusalem by the recently recruited Tanzim member Ibrahim Sarahne, who had once worked in the supermarket. The neighborhood is home to a mostly young population, young couples, students at the Ein Kerem medical campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, professors and teachers. The two crossed an Israeli checkpoint with the bomb in a bag on the car floor at Akhras' feet. In the aftermath of the bombing, Sarahne said that during the drive he suggested that he just throw the bomb, which would allow her to return home. Yet, she replied 'I'm not afraid. I want to kill people.' MIDEAST TURMOIL: VIOLENCE; In Suicide Bombings, the Taxi Man Got Away, New York Times June 13 2002 Akhras detonated her explosives and killed two people: a 17-year-old Israeli girl named Rachel Levy and a 55-year-old security guard named Haim Smadar who had attempted to stop Akhras from entering the supermarket. Smadar, who spoke Arabic, became suspicious after two Arabic women who usually sold vegetables outside the shop entrance were told by Akhras to leave. Smadar's actions saved the lives of many, as Akhras would otherwise have exploded the device inside the supermarket. On February 2014, Israeli returned the remains of Ayat to her family as part of prisoner swaps, enabling them to arrange her funeral.http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.572061 ==Reactions== The Al-Asqa Martyrs Brigade claimed responsibility in the press for the attack which the Israeli government denounced as an act of terrorism. The killings led then U.S. President George W. Bush to observe: ‚ÄúWhen an 18-year-old Palestinian girl is induced to blow herself up and in the process kills a 17-year-old Israeli girl, the future itself is dying, the future of the Palestinian people and the future of the Israeli people‚Äù.How Two Lives Met In Death The European Union condemned \\"firmly\\" the terror attack. The Saudi Ambassador to the UK, Dr Ghazi Abdul Rahman Algosaibi - a scholar and top politician in Saudi Arabia, wrote a poem in praise of al-Akhras, for which he was criticized by the UK and US governments, and among some Palestinians and Islamic militants, Akhras became a martyr (hero) figure, but the reaction among Akhras' family was mixed.Saudi Government-Controlled Daily Praises Passover and Jerusalem Supermarket Suicide Bombers , Jihad and Terroism Studies Project.Diplomat censured over bomb poem (BBC News 18 April 2002) According to a Newsweek, Akhras' fiance did not approve of violence and would have stopped her if he had known her plan. \\"May God forgive her for what she has done,\\" he reportedly said. Other members of Akhras' family, which were educated and moderate, condemned suicide bombings as morally wrong. However, they said that Israeli \\"brutality\\" had left Palestinians no other choice. In the 2007 documentary To Die in Jerusalem, Akhras' mother was confronted with the mother of 17 year-old Israeli victim of the bombing, Rachel Levy, but refused to denounce her daughter's action.To Die In Jerusalem == Novel == Prima di Lasciarsi (Before We Say Goodbye) by Gabriella Ambrosio is a novel based on Ayat al-Akras' story, published in Italy in 2004 by Nutrimenti and was awarded at the Festival du Premier Romance in Chamb√©ry, France. In 2008 the book's publication in both in Arabic and Hebrew was sponsored by Amnesty International and employed by Israeli colleges and human rights organizations working in Israel and the Palestinian Territories as an educational tool. It has then been published in the UK, Australia, and in New Zealand by Walker Books, in France as \\"Deuze Heures Avant\\"(Gallimard),in Germany as \\"Der Himmel uber Jerusalem\\" (Fischer Verlag) as well as in Spain (Noguer), Turkey (Remzi Kitabevi), Greece (Psichogios), Korea (JoongAng) and China (Jieli publishing house).

The motivation for the device was the discrepancy between the high speed at which a disk could deliver data, and the much lower speed at which a general-purpose processor could filter the data looking for records that matched a search condition.Leung, C. H. C. and Wong, K. S., 'File Processing Efficiency on the Content Addressable File Store', Proc VLDB 1985. http://www.vldb.org/conf/1985/P282.PDFScarrott, Gordon G., 'From Torsional Mode Delay Lines to DAP', Computer Resurrection, Number 12, Summer 1995, ISSN 0958-7403, pp. 19-28. http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/CCS/res/pdfs/res12.pdf Development of CAFS started in ICL's Research and Advanced Development Centre under Gordon Scarrott in the late 1960s following research by George Coulouris and John Evans who had completed a field study at Imperial College and Queen Mary College on database systems and applications (Scarrott, 1995). Their study had revealed the potential for substantial performance improvements in large-scale database applications by the inclusion of search logic in the disk controller. In its initial form, the search logic was built into the disk head. A standalone CAFS device was installed with a few customers, including BT Directory Enquiries, during the 1970s. The device was subsequently productised and in 1982 was incorporated as a standard feature within ICL's 2900 series and Series 39 mainframes. By this stage, to reduce costs and to take advantage of increased hardware speeds, the search logic was incorporated into the disk controller. A query expressed in a high-level query language could be compiled into a search specification that was then sent to the disk controller for execution. Initially this capability was integrated into ICL's own Querymaster query language, which worked in conjunction with the IDMS database; subsequently it was integrated into the ICL VME port of the Ingres relational database. ICL received the Queen's Award for Technological Achievement for CAFS in 1985. One factor which limited the adoption of CAFS was that the device needed to know the layout of data on disk, and placed constraints on this layout. Integrating database products with CAFS often involved a change in page layout, making the integration very expensive, especially with the market trend towards use of third-party database software. Managing data integrity in a concurrent environment also required close attention, since a CAFS search would execute without any knowledge of locks and caches maintained by the database software. ICL also produced a version of CAFS for its DRS minicomputer range called SCAFS (Son of CAFS). Unlike its mainframe cousin, this was implemented using custom firmware running on an industry-standard microprocessor. Software supporting third-party databases including Ingres, Informix and Oracle was marketed as the Ingres Search Accelerator (etc.). Each third-party product required modification, and was supplied with a dummy SCAFS interface library, to be replaced by the ICL product. The technology was also licensed to IBM for use with DB2 on the RS/6000. The device eventually became obsolete as processor speeds increased, removing the original justification for the device, namely that a central processor was not able to search data as fast as the disk subsystem could deliver it. Larger memory sizes also meant that many medium-sized databases could be kept entirely in memory. These factors removed any mass market for SCAFS and made it uneconomic. ==See also== *Content-addressable storage ==References== Category:Computer storage devices Category:Computer storage media Category:ICL mainframe computers Category:Computer-related introductions in 1982 ","title":"Content Addressable File Store"},{"id":"1271357","text":"Justin Barrett (born 13 April 1971) is an Irish far-right politician who has served as the leader of the National Party since 2016. A nationalist, he initially began activism in the 1990s, with the anti-abortion campaign group Youth Defence. He campaigned against the Treaty of Nice in 2002 and founded the National Party in 2016. Barrett and the National Party campaigned for a No vote in the 2018 abortion referendum through the Abortion Never campaign, which functioned as \\"an Irish nationalist anti-abortion campaign.\\" His early activism focused mostly on campaigning in Irish referenda from a Eurosceptic, anti-abortion, anti-immigration, and social conservative perspective. He has not held public office. He contested the 2004 European Election as an independent but has not run for election since then. ==Early life== Barrett was born in Cork city in 1971 and was adopted when he was five years old by a family in Borrisokane, County Tipperary. Slevin was his adopted parents' name. He identified as Justin Slevin for a period but eventually settled on Barrett, his biological parents' name. Barrett is a graduate in Business Studies from Athlone RTC. ==Political activism== ===Early activism (1987‚Äì1991)=== In 1991, he was involved in Young Fine Gael but left because of what he called the cynicism of the party. ===Youth Defence (1992‚Äì2004)=== From 1992 he became actively involved in the Irish anti-abortion movement, becoming the leader of Youth Defence. As a student in Athlone RTC he unsuccessfully contested the election for the Presidency of Union of Students in Ireland. During the 1995 divorce referendum, he was spokesman for the Youth Against Divorce campaign. In later years, he changed his mind on divorce. In April 1999, Barrett and seven other Youth Defence members were convicted of public order offences for a \\"mini-riot\\" outside the Adelaide Hospital that had taken place on 16 May 1998. Despite requests from hospital staff, the son of a dying woman and Garda√≠ to be quiet, a Youth Defence protest outside the hospital got louder and lead to \\"pandemonium\\" when Garda√≠ intervened. Barrett refused to apologise to the family of the dying woman as he \\"did not believe they had caused offence.\\" He was also involved in the campaign against the 2002 abortion referendum. He left Youth Defence in 2004 because he thought their methods of campaigning and interacting with people were becoming increasingly extreme and counterproductive. By 2016, Youth Defence were claiming to have never heard of Justin Barrett, or ever to have had any dealing with him. ===No to Nice Campaign=== In 2001, a referendum was held in Ireland to approve the Treaty of Nice. However the Treaty of Nice was rejected by 54% of the Irish people in what is known as the Nice I referendum. The following year a second referendum was held on the Treaty of Nice, known as the Nice II referendum. Justin Barrett campaigned against the Nice Treaty in both referenda. Barrett, then 31 years-old, established the No to Nice campaign with Rory O' Hanlon, a retired High Court judge. During the second Nice campaign, Barrett became the centre of a controversy over his participation in neo-fascist events in Germany and Italy. Barrett initially denied, and subsequently admitted that he had spoken at an event organised by the NPD, a far right, ultranationalist political party. Justin Barrett has always claimed that he spoke at these events in a pro-life capacity on behalf on the Youth Defence Organisation. ===2004 European Parliament election=== In 2004 Barrett announced his independent candidacy for the European Parliament election of the same year for the East constituency. He set up his headquarters in Drogheda, an area which had experienced a large influx of non-nationals. Gerry McGeough, a former Provisional IRA volunteer and Sinn F√©in national executive member, defected to Barrett's campaign. Barrett also supported the Citizenship referendum which was held on the same day as the European Parliament election. Barrett's campaign focused on immigration, euroscepticism and abortion. Barrett employed nationalist rhetoric during his campaign and stated his intention to \\"put Ireland first\\" in the European Parliament. Barrett had previously led the No to Nice campaign during the Nice Treaty referendum in 2002. Barrett campaigned alongside his wife Bernadette and their son Michael. He achieved 10,997 first preference votes or 2.4% of the total vote in the East constituency and failed to be elected. Later that year, while attending an immigration debate at University College Dublin's Literary & Historical Society, Barrett was assaulted by attendees allegedly belonging to an Irish anti-fascist group. The debate was chaired by popular RT√â radio presenter Joe Duffy, and featured √Åine N√≠ Chonaill of Immigration Control Platform. ===National Party (2016‚Äìpresent)=== Barrett being interviewed by Gemma O'Doherty in 2019 Barrett delivering a protest speech outside Google's European headquarters in Dublin In a press release in November 2016, Justin Barrett announced that he was President of the newly founded National Party, a political party that would oppose multi-culturalism and abortion. While Barrett had previously promoted the idea of a \\"Catholic republic\\", the National Party states that it is a secular party. The party was due to be publicly launched in a press event on 17 November 2016 at the Merrion Hotel in Dublin. However, after a public backlash, the hotel cancelled the event. Barrett called for a complete ban on Muslims entering Ireland and for the introduction of racial profiling. The party formally registered in early April 2019. While a Eurosceptic, Barrett does not advocate leaving the European Union (\\"Irexit\\"). Quoted in August 2019, Barrett reputedly believes that Ireland could have entered bilateral negotiations with the United Kingdom immediately after the Brexit referendum in 2016 and agreed to a separate deal with the British and then to have the EU accept that deal as part of their own negotiations with the British government. He criticised the Irish government and by extension the European Union's handling of Brexit. In September 2019, Barrett was milkshaked in Galway at a National Party protest. In October 2019 he addressed a community meeting in his hometown of Borrisokane on plans to open up a Direct Provision centre for 80 asylum seekers. An edited, audio-only version of his speech was played on the Claire Byrne Live show on RT√â One. ===2018 Irish abortion referendum=== Barrett founded Abortion Never as a No campaign in March 2018 to contest the Irish abortion referendum, 2018. Abortion Never presents itself as \\"an Irish nationalist anti-abortion campaign.\\" At the launch of the campaign, Barrett stated that if the abortion referendum passed, it would lead to euthanasia for the elderly; \\"It doesn‚Äôt just begin with abortion and stop there. It ends in euthanasia, because they already have a plan. You see discussions in the newspapers sometimes, ‚ÄòWhat are we going to do about the pensions crisis?‚Äô\\". At the same event, he called for the abortion referendum campaign to be \\"as divisive as possible\\". Ultimately, the referendum was approved by 66.4% of voters, with a 64.1% turnout. In April 2018, Jim Jefferies featured Barrett on a segment of The Jim Jefferies Show. Jefferies had Barrett travel to London for an interview on abortion (despite already being in Ireland to interview Tara Flynn), \\"so he could endure the same kind of bullshit every Irish woman has to go through if they want an abortion.\\" ==Publications== Barrett self-published a book in 1998 in which he set out his political principles and advocated the creation of a \\"Catholic Republic\\". Entitled The National Way Forward!, in its text he described immigration as \\"genocidal\\", and cited Hilaire Belloc, G. K. Chesterton and Arthur Penty as having been influential figures in his philosophical development. He also promoted the work of Father Denis Fahey. ==Controversy== ===Interactions with neo-Nazi and neo-fascist groups=== ====National Democratic Party of Germany==== Barrett spoke at events organised by the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) several times, and was the guest of honour at a NPD rally in Passau, Germany in 2000, in which anti-semitic speeches, peppered with quotes from Adolf Hitler were given, alongside claims that \\"Germany was the biggest victim of the second World War\\", and at which hundreds of skinheads gave standing ovations to elderly Nazis. The NPD confirmed that they had been in contact with Youth Defence for at least 6 years before. He attended two conferences, in October 1999 and 2000, organised by the youth wing of the NPD, the Junge Nationalisten (JN), alongside American white nationalist William Luther Pierce. The JN has spoken about how Youth Defence were an important part of their network. The National Party and Barrett have stated that he addressed meetings all across Europe in his capacity as a pro-life speaker. He has stated that he regrets \\"not being more careful\\" regarding his attendance of events held by the NPD in Germany. ====Forza Nuova (Italy)==== In June 2001, the website of neo-Fascist group Forza Nuova reported that Justin Barrett had attended a number of their events in Italy (in Milan, and Bologna). He attended and spoke at a Forza Nuova meeting in Milan in November 2002. Barrett shared a platform with Roberto Fiore at a rally of Italian fascists at the Hotel Miramar on 20 and 21 July 2001, in the Italian city of Civitanova. At the rally, Barrett was joined by Mario Di Giovanni, Youth Defence's representative in Italy. A group of Forza Nuova students, led by the then 25-year-old Marco Gladi, visited Ireland in 2001 to \\"study\\" with Youth Defence. In an editorial on the Forza Nuova website, the movement calls itself a \\"friend\\" of Mr Barrett and praises his efforts to defeat the Nice Treaty. ===The National Way Forward=== During the 2002 Nice Treaty referendum campaign, some of the ideologies in Barrett's 1998 book The National Way Forward! were queried by those advocating a \\"yes\\" vote, and it was noted that the book had \\"mysteriously disappeared from bookshelves during the campaign\\". Some commentators suggested that the \\"Barrett controversy\\" had shifted focus away from other issues and assisted the \\"yes\\" campaign. ==Personal life== In 2004, Justin Barrett had a wife, Bernadette, and children. As of 2016, he was seeking an annulment of this marriage. The breakdown of his relationship has changed his mind on divorce. Barrett is now married to Rebecca, a primary school teacher from Limerick. She is also involved in the National Party and was a candidate in the 2020 Irish general election for the Limerick City constituency. She received 345 (0.7%) first preference votes and was eliminated on the second count. ==See also== *Abortion in the Republic of Ireland *Niamh U√≠ Bhriain == References == Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Irish anti-communists Category:Irish far-right politicians Category:Irish anti-abortion activists Category:People from County Tipperary Category:Alumni of Athlone Institute of Technology ","title":"Justin Barrett"},{"id":"1271360","text":"CAFS may refer to: * Compressed air foam system, a system used in firefighting to deliver fire retardant foam to a fire * Content Addressable File Store, a hardware device developed by International Computers Limited that provided a disk storage with built-in search capability ==See also== * CAF (disambiguation) ","title":"CAFS"},{"id":"1271362","text":"Castres may refer to: * Castres, a commune in the Tarn department in the Midi- Pyr√©n√©es region * Castres, Aisne, a commune in the Aisne department in the Picardy region * Castres-Gironde, a commune in the Gironde department in the Aquitaine region * Arrondissement of Castres, an arrondissement in the Tarn department in the Midi-Pyr√©n√©es region ","title":"Castres (disambiguation)"},{"id":"1271366","text":"right Mixx was a user-driven social media web site that served to help users submit or find content by peers based on interest and location.

Examples of near money are as follows: * Savings accounts * Money market funds * Bank time deposits (certificates of deposit) * Government treasury securities (such as T-bills) * Bonds near their redemption date * Foreign currencies, especially widely traded ones such as the US dollar, euro or yen. Near money is not included in narrowly defined versions of the money supply, but broader versions include some types of near money. ==History== Over the past three centuries what has been accepted by the public as money has been expanded from gold and silver coins to include first bank notes and then bank deposits subject to transfer by check (cheque). Until recently, most economists would have agreed that money stopped at that point. No such agreement exists today, and the definition of money appropriate to present circumstances is debated. Since the 18th century, economists have known that the amount of money in circulation is an important economic variable. As the theories became more carefully specified in the 19th and early 20th centuries, they included a variable called the money supply. ==Functions of money== Money is often defined in terms of the three functions or services: as a medium of exchange, as a store of value and as a unit of account. ===Medium of exchange=== Money's most important function is as a medium of exchange to facilitate transactions. Without money, all transactions would have to be conducted by barter, which involves direct exchange of one good or service for another. ===Store of value=== In order to be a medium of exchange, money must hold its value over time; that is, it must be a store of value. If money could not be stored for some period of time and still remain valuable in exchange, it would not solve the double coincidence of wants problem and therefore would not be adopted as a medium of exchange. ===Unit of account=== Money also functions as a unit of account, providing a common measure of the value of goods and services being exchanged. Knowing the value or price of a good, in terms of money, enables both the supplier and the purchaser of the good to make decisions about how much of the good to supply and how much of the good to purchase. ==Assets with slightly lower liquidity== Thus near money can be considered as assets that fulfill the store-of-value function (as well as can be expected given the economic conditions) and are readily converted into a medium of exchange but are not themselves a medium of exchange. Deposits at a bank, savings and loan association, or building society etc. are a characteristic form of near money. Provided that the terms of the account permit immediate withdrawal, the deposit owner knows how much purchasing power he currently holds, and can turn the deposit into a medium of exchange (cash or a checking deposit/current account ) almost immediately. Short fixed term deposits (such as thirty-day treasury bills) and government bonds which are close to their maturity date are examples of assets which are not quite as liquid as a bank account that permits immediate withdrawal, but in many circumstances the difference is not important. Such assets are therefore often also regarded as \\"near money\\". ==See also== * Money supply * Deposit account * Savings account ==Sources== * * * Category:Monetary economics ","title":"Near money"},{"id":"1271396","text":"Estella Havisham (best known in literature simply as Estella) is a significant character in the Charles Dickens novel Great Expectations. Like the protagonist, Pip, Estella is introduced as an orphan, but where Pip was raised by his sister and her husband to become a blacksmith, Estella was adopted and raised by the wealthy and eccentric Miss Havisham to become a lady. ==Character history== ===Estella and Pip's pre-adult life=== Pip and Estella meet when he is brought to Miss Havisham's ill-kept mansion, Satis House, ostensibly to satisfy the elder Miss Havisham's \\"sick fancy\\" to be entertained by watching Pip and Estella play together. It is later revealed that her desire is to have his heart broken by Estella. ===Estella's relationship with Pip=== Estella states throughout the text, that she does not love Pip. However, this is contradicted by the fact that she shows numerous times in the novel that she holds Pip in a much higher regard compared to other men, and doesn't want to break his heart as she does with the others that she seduces. One of the possible meanings of this is that Estella, even though she doesn't acknowledge the fact, loves Pip. The manner in which Estella was brought up saw that she would undergo strong emotional suppression and is unable to identify her own feelings, let alone express them. In a way, Estella is a character to be pitied, and even through her actions, we can see that she is still a victim of Miss Havisham's cruel vengeance. ===Estella as a symbol of Pip's longings in life=== Pip is fascinated with the lovely Estella, though her heart is as cold as ice. Aside from the evident romantic interest, which continues through much of the story, Pip's meeting with Estella marks a turning point in his young life: her beauty, grace, and prospects represent the opposite of Pip's humble existence. Estella criticises Pip's honest but \\"coarse\\" ways, and from that point on, Pip grows dissatisfied with his position in life and, eventually, with his former values and friends as well. Pip spends years as companion to Miss Havisham and, by extension, Estella. He harbours intense love for Estella, though he has been warned that Estella has been brought up by Miss Havisham to inspire unrequited love in the men around her, in order to avenge the latter's disappointment at being jilted on her wedding day. Estella warns Pip that she cannot love him, or anyone. Miss Havisham herself eventually decries this coldness, for Estella is not even able to love her benefactress. ===Estella and Pip as adults=== After Pip receives an unexpected boon of a gentleman's upbringing and the \\"great expectation\\" of a future fortune from an unknown benefactor, he finds himself released from the blacksmith's apprenticeship that had been funded by Miss Havisham as compensation for Pip's years of service to her. He also finds himself thrown into Estella's social milieu in London, where Pip goes to be educated as a gentleman. He relentlessly pursues Estella, though her warm expressions of friendship are firmly countered by her insistence that she cannot love him. In fact, Pip discovers that Miss Havisham's lessons have worked all too well on Estella; when both are visiting the elderly woman, Miss Havisham makes gestures of affection towards her adopted daughter and is shocked that Estella is neither able nor willing to return them. Estella points out that Miss Havisham taught her to be hard-hearted and unloving. Even after witnessing this scene, Pip continues to live in anguished and fruitless hope that Estella will return his love. Estella flirts with and pursues Bentley Drummle, a disdainful rival of Pip's, and eventually marries him for his money. Seeing her flirt with the brutish Drummle, Pip asks Estella (rather bitterly) why she never displays such affection with him. :\\"Do you want me then\\", said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and serious, if not angry, look, \\"to deceive and entrap you?\\" :\\"Do you deceive and entrap him, Estella?\\" :\\"Yes, and many others‚Äîall of them but you.\\" This exchange suggests that Estella feels at least a modicum of love for Pip, as does the fact that in his presence, she never pretends to be anything but what she is. Rather than achieve the intended effect, this honest behaviour only frustrates Pip. It is implied that Drummle abuses Estella during their relationship and that she is very unhappy. However, by the end of the book, Drummle has been killed by a horse he has allegedly abused. The references to Drummle's marriage and death are conjectural, and no direct evidence is produced or suggested. Pip 'hears' of Drummle's poor behaviour and accepts the information as truth. The relationship between Pip and Estella worsens during their adult lives. Pip pursues her in a frenzy, often tormenting himself to the point of utter despair. He makes writhing, pathetic attempts to awaken some flicker of emotion in Estella, but these merely perplex her; Estella sees his devotion as irrational. ===Varied resolutions of Estella's relationship with Pip=== Estella and Pip. Art by thumb Though Estella marries Drummle in the novel and several adaptations, she does not marry him in the best-known 1946 film adaptation. However, in no version does she eventually marry Pip, at least not within the timespan of the story. The eventual resolution of Pip's pursuit of Estella at the end of the story varies among film adaptations and even in the novel itself. Dickens' original ending is deemed by many as consistent with the thread of the novel and with Estella's allegorical position as the human manifestation of Pip's longings for social status: As this ending was much criticized even by some famous fellow authors, Dickens wrote a second ending currently considered as the definitive one, more hopeful but also more ambiguous than the original, in which Pip and Estella have a spiritual and emotional reconciliation. The second ending echoes strongly the theme of closure found in much of the novel; Pip and Estella's relationship at the end is marked by some sadness and some joy, and although Estella still indicates that she doesn't believe she and Pip will be together, Pip perceives that she will stay with him: ===Estella's origins=== Though she never knows it herself, Pip finally finds out where Estella comes from. She was the child of Jaggers's maidservant Molly, a gypsy at that time, and Abel Magwitch. Pip becomes convinced that Molly is Estella's mother during his second dinner at Jaggers's place, when he realizes that their eyes are the same and that, when unoccupied, their fingers perform a knitting action. Wemmick tells him Molly's story: she had a child, the same age as Estella whose fate remains unknown. She came to Jaggers after he saved her from the gallows, as she had been accused of having murdered a woman out of jealousy. One evening, after Pip returned from a visit at Miss Havisham's, Herbert tells him a story that Magwitch told him: Magwitch had a wife once and they had a child, a girl, whom Magwitch loved dearly. His wife told him she'd kill the child (because the child was what Magwitch loved the most, and Molly wanted him to suffer for what he did to her) and, as much as he knows, she did. Shortly afterwards, she was accused of murder, acquitted and then disappeared. The two stories fit so well, that Pip has no doubt: Estella is the child of Abel and Molly. He tells this to Jaggers and Wemmick, unable to keep it to himself. Jaggers tells him the missing bit of the story (only assuming, that it could have been like that): Molly gave the child to him, to be safe in case of her conviction. Abel, believing it dead, did not dare make a stir about it. At the same time, Miss Havisham was looking for a girl to bring up and save from a misery like her own and Jaggers gave Estella to her. She was two or three at the time. Miss Havisham did not know where she came from and named her Estella. Jaggers advises Pip to be quiet about it. For whose sake would he tell it? The father had to keep in hiding, the mother had been about to kill the child and the daughter had escaped disgrace and would be dragged back into it by the revelation. Pip keeps quiet, and only tells Magwitch, on his deathbed, that his child lives. Pip tells him that she is a beautiful young lady and that he was in love with her. ==References in pop culture== *Estella is referenced in Alanis Morissette's 1995 hit \\"All I Really Want\\".

Known for building and running a criminal enterprise revolving around gambling dens, hotels, racketeering, extortion, loan sharking and restaurants that fronted for brothels, during his heyday, NƒÉm Cam was considered as one of the most powerful mob bosses in Vietnam, and was said to have attained influence that even extended into the ranks of Vietnam's Communist Party which he used to his advantage by bribing law enforcement and government officials to protect his lucrative enterprise and cover up his murders of other criminal rivals in Saigon that challenged his reign. In fact, his connection and ties with the Vietnam's Communist Party was so tight that during his trial, 153 other people that were tried with him were high ranking officers of the Communist Party. For 15 years, NƒÉm Cam reigned as the Godfather of Saigon. His downfall however came during a gang feud with another notorious female gangster from the northern city of Haiphong, Dung H√† who was considered as one of the two great powers of the Vietnamese underworld alongside NƒÉm Cam. Coming to the South, Dung H√† attempted to build her own gang in Saigon, and often came into conflict with VƒÉn Cam. After a series of confrontations and standoffs between Dung H√†'s group and NƒÉm Cam's mob, Cam ordered the murder of Dung H√†. Authorities later arrested him alongside several members of his mob and cooperating Communist Party officers, leading to a massive public trial totaling 155 defendants, making it the largest criminal trial in the country at the time. NƒÉm Cam and four of his members were sentenced to death, and NƒÉm Cam was executed on June 3, 2004. ==Early life and Initiation into Crime== Tr∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Cam was born in 1947 to a poor family in Saigon as the son of Tr∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn B∆∞·ªüi, who had immigrated from Qu·∫£ng Nam to Saigon. NƒÉm Cam's first brush with the law came when he was just 15 years old for stabbing a man to death in a fight; he subsequently served two years in prison before joining the South Vietnamese army in 1966. As a youth, he was infamous around the local area for his brutal machete fights and for his slick ways of avoiding the police. Becoming a gangster from early on, VƒÉn Cam was first initiated into the criminal underworld by Hu·ª≥nh T·ª≥, a major player in the black society of Saigon at the time. During his early years as a youth in Saigon, NƒÉm Cam was a follower of the most infamous mob leader in Saigon during the 60s, ƒê·∫°i Cathay, who was considered to be the top or the number 1 of the \\"Four Great Kings\\" of Saigon at the time. It was during his time as a member of Cathay's mob that NƒÉm Cam would later learn from Cathay how to run and organize a casino in order to make great profits from it, a method that he would later utilize during his reign of Saigon during the 90s. Later, ƒê·∫°i Cathay and B·∫£y Sy, who was NƒÉm Cam's brother-in-law were arrested as a result of South Vietnam's government campaign against crime in August 1966. Later, B·∫£y Sy was released and soon opened a casino, where NƒÉm Cam and Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Nh√£ helped out to run the casino. During this time, NƒÉm Cam, under the guidance of B·∫£y Sy planned to kill T√†i ch√©m, a notorious gangster in the first district of Saigon, but the plan failed and resulted in NƒÉm Cam being chased by T√†i ch√©m's gang brothers. After that, Hi·∫øu Tr·ªçc saved young NƒÉm Cam's life and put him into the position of military logistics staff of the 313th Company of the Armed Forces in the South Vietnamese army. After that, NƒÉm Cam became a swimmer of the Military Office of the Armed Forces for the army. ==Life as a criminal== Communist re- education camp Prior to 1975, NƒÉm Cam was not well known within the criminal world of Vietnam, mainly playing the role of follower such as when he was a follower of infamous mob leader ƒê·∫°i Cathay or worked in the casinos owned by B·∫£y Sy. However, following the end of the war after 1975, NƒÉm Cam would turn into a dangerous criminal. After the South Vietnamese government collapsed and was taken over by the North, NƒÉm Cam was presented to the 4th District Administration Board and was sent to reeducation camp. After his release, VƒÉn Cam lived through trading old watches and radios at the Hu·ª≥nh Th√∫c Kh√°ng market in the first district. However, before long, NƒÉm Cam once again became engaged in illegal activities, especially gambling. On June 3, 1978, NƒÉm Cam was arrested by the Ho Chi Minh City District 1 Police Department for gambling and was released two months later. Continuing until December 30, 1980, he was detained by the Organized Crime Police Unit of HCMC for two more years in ƒê·ªìng Ph√∫ prison once again for gambling. On May 20, 1995, NƒÉm Cam was once again placed in a reeducation camp for three years at Thanh H√† for running an illegal gambling business. Later, he was freed before the deadline of his release on October 4, 1997. It was this time period, that the department tried to stack up more charges on him from his younger days, including one where he minced a rival's fingers on a meat cutting board. The plan failed due to the victim and his brother was reported missing after a fishing trip. With his experience of being a ringleader, NƒÉm Cam was regarded as being high skilled and sophisticated in his orders and guidance towards his followers, making sure to leave as little as evidence as possible by creating alibis for his crimes and directing his brothers only through the use of secret signals. Due to his gambling business, NƒÉm Cam was able to amass substantial wealth for himself. In 1994, he was arrested and convicted for his criminal dealings, but was released early in May 1995 after an intervention by Tr·∫ßn Mai H·∫°nh, director of Radio the Voice of Vietnam. Charges laid against him included murder, assault, gambling, organising gambling, organising bribery, abetting criminals, and organizing illegal emigration. ==Attack on L√™ Ng·ªçc L√¢m== For some time, there was great friction and altercation between L√™ Ng·ªçc L√¢m and NƒÉm Cam in the underworld. In order to resolve this problem, prior to his later conflict with Dung H√†, NƒÉm Cam ordered the female gang boss to carry out the attack on Ng·ªçc L√¢m. Ng·ªçc L√¢m managed to survive the attack, but the high concentration of acid that was thrown on him left him with serious health and lasting aesthetic damage. Later, authorities concluded that NƒÉm Cam was the mastermind behind the attack, and Dung H√† was the organizer while Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Th·ªç was the one who bought the acid. ==Assassination of Dung Ha== The conviction that led, perhaps indirectly, to his execution was due to his role in the assassination of underworld rival Dung H√†. Dung H√†, a reputed female gangster from Haiphong in northern Vietnam, moved south to Ho Chi Minh City, to join forces with NƒÉm Cam, who hoped to get her to serve as his emissary in expanding his casinos in the north. However, Dung H√† had other plans to create her own gang, which angered NƒÉm Cam. Dung Ha wanted to embarrass NƒÉm Cam and arranged for a gift box containing rats to be delivered to one of NƒÉm Cam's restaurants in Ho Chi Minh City. Humiliated and enraged, NƒÉm Cam ordered a hit on Dung H√†, which was carried out on October 2, 2000. Two men, traveling on motorbike, came up and parked near where she was sitting. One of them got off the bike, walked up to her, pulled out a 9mm revolver and shot her in the head at point-blank range. At the time, Dung Ha had sent her body guard to remove someone causing a minor disruption next door. When the shot was heard, the body guard rushed back and fired from his single shot pistol. The assassins escaped nonetheless unscathed. It was unknown what happened to the body guard after, but according to close associates of Dung Ha, he fled the country after a threat from a reputable member of Dung Ha's mob for failing his job. On June 4, 2003, NƒÉm Cam was convicted for ordering the assassination of Dung H√† and bribing state officials to protect his criminal network and was sentenced to death by the court. However, it was not until the police were able to collect all of the evidence, documents and secure the testimonies from Nguy·ªÖn Tu·∫•n H·∫£i, Nguy·ªÖn Vi·ªát H∆∞ng, Nguy·ªÖn Xu√¢n Tr∆∞·ªùng that Tr∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Cam finally admitted to all of his offenses in public. ==NƒÉm Cam's Trial== NƒÉm Cam's trial in the Ho Chi Minh City‚Äôs People's Court was one of the largest in Vietnam's history. Margie Mason of the Associated Press wrote of the trial that \\"Vietnam's most notorious underworld boss has appeared in court with 154 others in what could be one of the Communist country's most important trials. Nam Cam has been charged with seven counts. He faces death by firing squad if convicted. His co-defendants include two expelled members of the Communist Party's powerful Central Committee, 13 senior police officers, three former prosecutors and three state journalists.\\" During the trial, there were 3 judges, 80 lawyers and 30 witnesses. Others who were also on trial included NƒÉm Cam's first wife Phan Th·ªã Tr√∫c, who was charged with and found guilty of bribery, loan sharking and sheltering criminals. Cam's son-in-law and daughter were also charged with and found guilty of bribery. The number of defendants who stood trial totaled 154, all of whom were charged with a list of assorted crimes such as murder and unveiling national secrets. The opening of the trial was broadcast live on national television, with the mafia leader NƒÉm Cam being filmed with handcuffs on and was shown dressed in a black-striped prison uniform during the court proceedings. At the same time, live TV screens were placed in front of the court, screening information regarding the charges of the defendants for journalists to see. In total, nearly an hour had passed before the court could finish reading all of the charges against the 154 defendants in the trial. The case attracted unprecedented national attention from the Vietnamese public, such as when a crowd of over 500 people waited outside of the courtroom all for a chance to get a glimpse of the infamous mafia boss. The trial also had ripple effects outside of Vietnam, as it received attention from the international community. Some foreign observers, like Carl Thayer believed that the trial and conviction of NƒÉm Cam and his men was a step in a positive direction, showing that the Vietnamese government was willing to put forth an effort to curb political corruption within the country. ==Fallout from his conviction== Subsequently, former Ho Chi Minh City police chief (1996‚Äì2001), B√πi Qu·ªëc Huy, was found guilty of negligence for enabling mafia boss NƒÉm Cam to carry out his illegal operations. Tr·∫ßn Mai H·∫°nh, the former head of state radio, and Ph·∫°m S·ªπ Chi·∫øn, a former deputy national chief prosecutor, were both found guilty of receiving various bribes from NƒÉm Cam, which included an Omega watch and a stereo. The communist government touted the case as proof that they were determined to stamp out organised crime and corruption, a major source of discontent among Vietnamese. On May 7, 2004, President Tr·∫ßn ƒê·ª©c L∆∞∆°ng of Vietnam, rejected NƒÉm Cam's appeal of execution. On June 3, 2004, Tr∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Cam was executed by firing squad at the district 9 rifle range in Ho Chi Minh city, along with his four gang members Ph·∫°m VƒÉn Minh, Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Th·ªãnh, Ch√¢u Ph√°t Lai Em and Nguy·ªÖn Vi·ªát H∆∞ng, the last being the one who shot Dung H√†. ==References== ==External links== *Nam Cam: Vietnam's Godfather BBC News *Vietnam officials sacked for mob links *Mafioso Nam Cam executed *Police nab Nam Cam's right arm * Category:1948 births Category:2004 deaths Category:21st-century executions by Vietnam Category:Mob bosses Category:Executed Vietnamese people Category:People executed for murder Category:People from Ho Chi Minh City Category:Vietnamese people of the Vietnam War Category:Vietnamese mobsters Category:People executed by Vietnam by firing squad Category:Executed mobsters ","title":"NƒÉm Cam"},{"id":"1271405","text":"Lust in the Dust is a 1985 Western comedy film starring Tab Hunter, Divine, Cesar Romero, and Lainie Kazan, and directed by Paul Bartel. ==Plot== Dance- hall girl Rosie Velez (Divine), lost in the desert, is helped to safety by gunman Abel Wood (Tab Hunter).

This pair of letters is used as a Christian symbol, and is often combined with the Cross, Chi-rho, or other Christian symbols. ==Origin== The term Alpha and Omega comes from the phrase \\"I am Alpha and Omega\\" (Koin√© Greek: \\"·ºêŒ≥œé Œµ·º∞ŒºŒπ œÑ·Ω∏ ·ºåŒªœÜŒ± Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÑ·Ω∏ ·ΩÆ\\"), an appellation of Jesus. The words are used by Jesus according to the translation of J. B. Philipps, in which he places these words in red to indicate that it is Jesus speaking. in the Book of Revelation (verses 1:8, 21:6, and 22:13). The first part of this phrase (\\"I am the Alpha and Omega\\") is first found in Chapter 1 verse 8 (\\"1:8\\"), and is found in every manuscript of Revelation that has 1:8. Several later manuscripts repeat \\"I am the Alpha and Omega\\" in 1:11 too, but do not receive support here from most of the oldest manuscripts, including the Alexandrine, Sinaitic, and Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus. It is, therefore, omitted in some modern translations. Scholar Robert Young stated, with regard to \\"I am the Alpha and Omega\\" in 1:11, the \\"oldest [manuscripts] omit\\" it. A similar reference is in Isaiah 44, where the Lord says to be the first and the one who is after all. ==Christianity== Alpha (Œë) and omega (Œ©) are the first and last letters, respectively, of the classical (Ionic) Greek alphabet. Thus, the phrase \\"I am the alpha and the omega\\" is further clarified with the additional phrase, \\"the beginning and the end\\" in Revelation 21:6, 22:13. The first and last letters of the Greek alphabet were used because the book of Revelation is in the New Testament, which was originally written in Greek. This phrase is interpreted by many Christians to mean that Jesus has existed for all eternity or that God is eternal. Though many commentators and dictionaries ascribe the title \\"the alpha and the omega\\" to both God and to Christ,The New Bible Dictionary, edited by Alton Bryant; Bible Dictionary by Wm. Smith; and the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia some secular sources argue otherwise. Barnes' Notes on the New Testament (1974) claims: \\"It cannot be absolutely certain that the writer meant to refer to the Lord Jesus specifically here ... There is no real incongruity in supposing, also, that the writer here meant to refer to God as such.\\"Notes on the New Testament, Explanatory and Practical by Albert Barnes. 1956, 1962, 1974. Most Christian denominations also teach that the title applies to both Jesus and his Father. The letters Alpha and Omega, in juxtaposition, are often used as a Christian visual symbol (see examples). The symbols were used in early Christianity and appear in the Roman catacombs. The letters were shown hanging from the arms of the cross in Early Christian art, and some crux gemmata, jeweled crosses in precious metal, have formed letters hanging in this way, called pendilia; for example, in the Asturian coat of arms, which is based upon the Asturian Victory Cross. In fact, despite always being in Greek, the letters became more common in Western than Eastern Orthodox Christian art. They are often shown to the left and right of Christ's head, sometimes within his halo, where they take the place of the Christogram used in Orthodox art.
