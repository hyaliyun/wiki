For example, if a domain offered an online store as part of their website \`example.com\`, you might use the subdomain \`shop.example.com\` . == Overview == A Fully Qualified Domain Name consists of multiple parts. For example, the english wikipedia domain: \`en.wikipedia.org\` The \`en\` is a subdomain. Although \`wikipedia.org\` is usually considered to be the domain name, \`wikipedia\` is actually a sub-domain of the \`org\` TLD (top level domain). The Domain Name System (DNS) has a tree structure or hierarchy, which includes nodes on the tree being a domain name. A subdomain is a domain that is part of a larger domain. Each label may contain from 1 to 63 octets. The full domain name may not exceed a total length of 253 ASCII characters in its textual representation.RFC 1035, Domain names--Implementation and specification, P. Mockapetris (Nov 1987) Most domain registries only allocate a two-level domain name. Hosting services typically provide DNS Servers to resolve subdomains within that master domain. Subdomains in this context are defined by editing the DNS zone file pertaining to the parent domain. However, there is an ongoing debate over the use of the term ‚Äúsubdomain‚Äù when referring to names which map to the Address record A (host) and various other types of zone records which may map to any public IP address destination and any type of server. Network Operations teams insist that it is inappropriate to use the term ‚Äúsubdomain‚Äù to refer to any mapping other than that provided by zone NS (name server) records and any server-destination other than that. According to RFC 1034, \\"a domain is a subdomain of another domain if it is contained within that domain\\". Based on that definition, a host cannot be a subdomain, only a domain can be a subdomain. A subdomain will also have a separate zone file with a SOA record (Start of Authority). Any Fully Qualified Domain Name can be a host or a subdomain. == Subdomain usage == Subdomains are often used by internet service providers supplying web services. They allocate one (or more) subdomains to their clients who do not have their own domain name. This allows independent administration by the clients over their subdomain. Subdomains are also used by organizations that wish to assign a unique name to a particular department, function, or service related to the organization. For example, a university might assign \\"cs\\" to the computer science department, such that a number of hosts could be used inside that subdomain, such as \`www.cs.example.edu\`. There as some widely recognized subdomains including www, ftp. This allows for a structure where the domain contains administrative directories and files including the ftp directories and webpages. The ftp subdomain can contain logs and the web page directories. The www subdomain contains the directories for the webpages. Independent authentication for each domain provides access control over the various levels of the domain. == Uses == In the United Kingdom, the second-level domain names are standard and branch off from the top-level domain. For example: * .ac.uk - academic (tertiary education, further education colleges and research establishments) and learned societies * .co.uk - general use (usually commercial) * .gov.uk - government (central and local) * .judiciary.uk - courts (to be introduced in the near future) * .ltd.uk - limited companies * .me.uk - general use (usually personal) * .mod.uk - Ministry of Defence and HM Forces public sites * .net.uk - ISPs and network companies (unlike .net, use is restricted to these users) * .nhs.uk - National Health Service institutions * .nic.uk - network use only (Nominet UK) * .org.uk - general use (usually for non-profit organisations) * .parliament.uk - parliamentary use (only for the UK Parliament and the Scottish Parliament) * .plc.uk - public limited companies * .police.uk - police forces * .sch.uk - Local Education Authorities, schools, primary and secondary education, community education === Vanity domain === A vanity domain is a subdomain of an ISP's domain that is aliased to an individual user account, or a subdomain that expresses the individuality of the person on whose behalf it is registered. === Server cluster === Depending on application, a record inside a domain, or subdomain might refer to a hostname, or a service provided by a number of machines in a cluster. Some websites use different subdomains to point to different server clusters. For example, \`www.example.com\` points to Server Cluster 1 or Datacentre 1, and \`www2.example.com\` points to Server Cluster 2 or Datacentre 2 etc.. ==== Subdomains versus directories ==== Subdomains are different from directories. For example, example.com/ComputingStuff points to a directory within the example.com domain. Internet service providers frequently assign the root of a subdomain server to a directory within the master domain server root with a similar (but not necessarily identical) name. ==See also== *Domain name *Hostname *Subdirectory *Webpage *Subpage *Vanity domain ==References== Category:Domain Name System de:Domain#Subdomain ","title":"Subdomain"},{"id":"844471","text":"Eduardo Humberto del R√≠o Garc√≠a (June 20, 1934 ‚Äì August 8, 2017), better known by his pen name Rius, was a Mexican intellectual, political cartoonist and writer born in Zamora, Michoac√°n. One of the most popular Mexican cartoonists, Rius has written over a hundred books that remain widely popular, especially amongst his Mexican readers. Rius was a fierce political activist, and his progressive and left-wing point of view is often present in his writings, accompanied by a strong criticism about neoliberal Mexican doctrines, US Government policies, and the Catholic Church. He used to be an open advocate of the Cuban revolution as in Cuba for Beginners and a strong Soviet bloc sympathizer until the end of the Cold War. In the 1960s he began cartooning in magazines and newspapers, sometimes regarding political themes. He made two famous comics, Los Supermachos and Los agachados, which were a humorous criticism of the Mexican government. After his successes with these, he made many books, all illustrated and written by hand by him and covering a range of topics on politics, vegetarianism, and religion. His books have become popular mainly because of their humour, which attempts to reach the general reader, as well as for their simplicity and intellectual acuteness. They give an overview of their theme without becoming difficult. In 1970, the first English edition of Rius's book Cuba para principiantes, a humorous comic strip presentation of Cuban history and revolution, was published in the United States as Cuba for Beginners. The book made no particularly great impact, but the 1976 English language publication of Marx for Beginners, a translation of his Marx para principiantes (1972), a comic strip representation of the life and ideas of Karl Marx, became an international bestseller and kicked off the For Beginners series of books from Writers and Readers and later Icon Books.The history of Introducing books, introducingbooks.com. Accessed 2011-01-29.Our Story , For Beginners books. Accessed 2011-01-29. In the 1990s, he participated in two political humour magazines: El Chahuistle and El Chamuco (named after an insect plague and the devil, respectively, because they were harsh on politicians and religious leaders). His success and long career have made him a reference point to the newer generations of political cartoonists in M√©xico. Mexican director Alfonso Arau made Calzonzin Inspector, a live action film based on characters appearing in Los Supermachos that was released in 1974.

It is considered a strategic waterway in London, forming part of the Blue Ribbon Network. It flows through the London Borough of Havering roughly from north to south, joining the Thames at Rainham. ==Etymology== The name is recorded in 1062 as Ingceburne and its suffix is a form of the Old English 'burna', meaning bourne, a type of stream. The meaning of the prefix is unclear, although it could refer to a person. ==Description== It rises near Brentwood, Essex, whence it flows in a southwesterly direction under the M25 motorway through the London Borough of Havering in north east London. The river passes under the motorway near Junction 28, where the first of its tributaries, the 2.7 miles (4.3 km) long Weald Brook joins, followed shortly by Carters Brook and Paynes Brook. After skirting south of the built-up area of Harold Hill the route is partly non-urban: a large area of flood-plain follows before the Ingrebourne threads between the suburbs of Upminster and Hornchurch. The river from here is surrounded by public open space: with Gaynes Parkway, the Ingrebourne Valley Greenway and Hornchurch Country Park taking up the area until reaching Rainham. Here the river divides, the main channel becoming Rainham Creek, where it flows into the Thames between Hornchurch Marshes (to the west) and Rainham Marshes (to the east) at Old Man's Head. The second channel becomes the Wennington Sewers complex. ==Significance== The Ingrebourne Marshes are a Site of Special Scientific Interest because of the diversity of its wildlife and extensive areas of wetland reeds.Natural England, Ingrebourne Marshes citation The river forms one of the strategic waterways identified in the Blue Ribbon Network policy in the London Plan.

It covers 38,584 dunams (~38.6 km¬≤), and had a population of in . It is named after the Biblical Jeroham. Until early 2011 the mayor of Yeruham was Amram Mitzna, and he was succeeded by Michael Biton of Kadima, who was elected mayor in November 2010. In 2018, dark horse candidate Tal Ohana was elected the first female mayor of Yeruham. For many years, Yeruham was economically depressed and suffered from image problems, but major efforts to improve the quality of life took place during early 2000s.Yeruham calls elections overrated Haaretz, 28 October 2007 ==History== ===Antiquity=== Yeruham is the site of Tel Rahma, dating back to the 10th century BCE. On the outskirts of Yeruham is an ancient well, Be'er Rahma (). During the Nabatean, Roman and Byzantine periods there was a village in the western outskirts of the town and its ruins can be seen today. The site, known Qasr Rekhmeh or Mesad Yeruham, was excavated in 1966 by R. Cohen. ===Modern era=== Modern Yeruham was founded on 9 January 1951 as Kfar Yeruham () and was one of Israel's first development towns, created to settle frontier areas in the early days of the state. It was located near the Large Makhtesh, an area thought at the time to be rich with natural resources. thumb The first influx of olim (Jewish immigrants) came from Romania, many of them Holocaust survivors, followed by immigrants from North Africa, Persia, India and elsewhere, who make up the majority of the town's population today (appr. 40%, 5%, 20%, 10% respectively). By 1961, the town's population was 1,574. The name was changed to Yeruham in 1962. Yeruham was founded on the Petroleum Road in the Negev (today roads 224 and 225) and its initial growth was stymied by the construction of Highway 25 and the Beersheba ‚Äì Mitzpe Ramon section of Highway 40, which created a new route to Eilat and made the Petroleum Road obsolete. Since autumn 1990, Yeruham had actively been involved in absorbing hundreds of olim from the Former USSR, who came to comprise 25% of the town's nearly 10,000 residents. In recent years, young couples and families from other localities have moved to Yeruham, and some have purchased lots and built their homes in the town's new neighborhoods. Members of the Young People in Yeruham Student Settlement Group are involved in local social action projects, organize cultural events for young people, and attract young people to settle in Yeruham. In April 2008, the Ayalim Student Village opened in Yeruham to allow students in Negev institutions of higher education to live and volunteer in the town. North American students from Nativ College Leadership Program engage in volunteer community service in Yeruham every spring. They help teach English in the local high schools and yeshivot, work with the Magen David Adom ambulance corps, teach in preschools and much more. ==Geography== Yeruham lake Yeruham is situated in the northern Negev, 15 km from Dimona, 600 meters above sea level. It is located within the Negev desert and has erosion cirques or ‚Äòcraters‚Äô and close by is the Yeruham Iris Nature Reserve, where the rare native iris Iris petrana is found. ==Economy== Tempo Glass bottles factory, 1968. The main employers are local and regional industry (53% of employed residents) and services and commerce. Most of those are employed in industry work in local factories such as Agis-Perrigo (Careline cosmetics and pharmaceuticals), Negev Ceramics, Phoenicia Glass Works (which moved to Yeruham from Haifa in 1968)Phoenicia Glass Works Brand Metals, Ackerstein, Yehu Clays, TTK electronics, and Tempo (some of which utilize raw materials from the region). The rest of those employed work in the surrounding region in companies such as, Ramat Hovav, Negev Nuclear Research Center, Dead Sea Works, Soroka Medical Center in Beer Sheva, Ben-Gurion University, and in Sde Boker. Yeruham has suffered in the past from high unemployment rates, although today the rate is lower than the national average. Tourism projects include development of the Lake Park around Yeruham Dam and Large Makhtesh. Professional training programs in computers, chemistry, engineering and other fields needed by industry. Local industrial zones have doubled in size and offer space for rental and construction. Up to 2011, residential construction in Yeruham had been done in a non-profit manner, either by Amidar or the residents themselves. In anticipation of military personnel moving into Yeruham to server in the future adjacent City of Training Bases, land had been released for private for-profit construction. In 2015, a tech incubator, MindCET, was established in Yeruham as a center for leadership and innovation in educational technology to foster specialized cooperation between entrepreneurs, researchers, teachers and students.Yeruham welcomes new tech incubator, MindCET MindCET operates a high-tech accelerator for edtech startups.Negev taking shape: Young entrepreneurs bring high tech arts to southern Israel, Haaretz ==Education== Yeruham town hall Yeruham has 5 elementary schools (State-General and State-Religious), 3 Ultra-Orthodox schools, and a comprehensive high school affiliated with ORT. Since the inauguration of the \\"Anyone Can Do It\\" program, the number of high school students eligible for Bagrut matriculation certificates has risen. All schools in Yeruham use GBS, an online system which enables pupils to work at home on material from school. The \\"City Plays Music\\" program provides music education in all the elementary schools, and operates two youth orchestras. Yeshivat Heseder, Yeruham Bilvav Shalem high school yeshiva for boys and Kamah junior high for girls attract pupils from all over the country. Yeshivat HaHesder Yerucham (institute of higher Jewish religious education for men combining study with army service), also attracts students from all over the country and runs a special leadership program for Ethiopian young men. Midreshet Be'er offers a post-high school track for young religious women that combines study with community volunteering. The women do two years of IDF or National Service, and a final half-year of social action projects in Yeruham. Education and training for over-30 adults are coordinated by the Ofek Center for Human Resources Development. Joint programs with the Weizmann Institute, Ben-Gurion University, the Open University, the Hebrew University Center for Enrichment in Education, and volunteer tutoring by scientists at the Nuclear Research Center aim to improve educational achievements and provide enrichment, especially in the sciences. ==Culture == Yeruham community center The Yeruham Matnas (Local Community Center) organizes plays, performances, summer events, music lessons, sports activities, nature-oriented extracurricular activities, neighborhood clubs, immigrant absorption activities, a Yiddish choir and communal theater group. The Library has 60,000 books in Hebrew, Russian and English, and offers enrichment activities for pre-school and elementary school students, meetings with authors, computer training, workshops for parents and children and creative writing groups.

Previously agricultural, with some sand and gravel quarrying on the site of Asda Queslett; it was developed as a residential suburb of Birmingham immediately before and after World War II. Many of the houses in the Thornbridge Avenue and Booth's Farm Road areas were constructed before the outbreak of war, while the remaining part of the estate (between the Beeches and Aldridge Roads) was completed after 1945. The Perry Beeches area is bisected by the M6 motorway, constructed in the early 1970s. The housing in the southern part of Perry Beeches -in the Thornbridge Avenue area and at the eastern end of the Beeches Road (formerly known as Brick Kiln Lane)- was built by Henry Boot of Sheffield for the 'First National Housing Trust' - who also built a similar estate, albeit with houses of a slightly larger floorplan, at Pheasey. This is located to the north-east of the Beeches Estate on land that was part of Aldridge Urban District Council and now part of Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council. Most of these houses were built in blocks of 4-6 with some blocks of 2 semi-detached in a similar style where space would not allow for larger blocks, or where the land was too steep for these blocks - notably in Holmesfield Road; that was built on a steep hill. While many residents have now bought these properties and made many alterations, the original floorplan for most houses consisted of a hallway, front room and then a rear kitchen with pantry, coal hole and a downstairs toilet. As these houses were originally rented, they had identical wooden doors and windows painted cream, with either dark green or brown doors and outer frames. Wooden fences with a garden hedge were also placed around every house. The houses to the north of the area (north of the Beeches Road between the Walsall and M6) were by contrast privately owned. These are mostly blocks of semi-detached houses with generally more decorative features, including large circular bay windows on the upper and ground floor, stained glass front doors and windows, and in most cases both a front and back reception room. At the rear of most houses in the Walsall Road and Booths Farm Road area, the houses were built with long rear access 'right of ways'. These proved useful as more people owned a private car from the early 1950s onwards and were able to build a garage on the bottom part of their back garden plot opening onto these 'right of ways'. They also made good short-cuts. In recent years, however, these became good access routes for thieves breaking into garages and houses. Due to this, many now have large padlocked gates at their roadside entrance and are only accessible to residents. There are a number of primary schools around this area and two secondary schools with one being directly located on the Beeches Estate. Secondary education is provided at Perry Beeches The Academy. ==References== Category:Areas of Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Great Barr ","title":"Perry Beeches"},{"id":"844522","text":"Bramley is a village and parish in Hampshire, England. In the 2001 census it had a population of 3,348. It has a village shop, bakery, estate agency, pub - The Bramley Inn (opened in 1897 as The Six Bells) and a railway station. Also, Bramley Camp houses an Army facility where military training and manoeuvres take place. ==History== Evidence of Bramley's first inhabitants can be found in Bullsdown Camp, a prehistoric settlement, where remnants of flint-scrapers, a spear-head, a core and flint-flakes have been found. This is thought to be a late Celtic \\"triple-walled dun\\".This fortification can still be seen today, situated to the east of the village south of the Bramley to Sherfield road.https://www.inspirock.com/united-kingdom/bramley/d262758255 The Reverend Robert Toogood wrote a history of the village and church. It includes some anecdotes about King Henry VIII's connections with the village and Cufaude Manor. The Romans occupied Calleva Atrebatum and built a walled city known today as Silchester. Bramley is on the Chichester to Silchester Way Roman road and has remains of a Romano-British villa nearby. leftThe Church of St James stands at the west of the village and originally dates from 1160, however it features many historical alterations and additions up to the 20th Century. It is a Grade I listed building. St James' church, Bramley, Hampshire. Within the church, images were uncovered which dated back to the pre-Reformation. The famous physicist Lise Meitner is buried in the burial ground next to the church, near the grave of her brother Walter. The railway line between Reading and Basingstoke was built through the village in 1848. The village had to wait another 47 years until on 1 May 1895 a station in the village opened, at the insistence of the then Duke of Wellington, a prominent landowner in the area.http://bramleyndp.org.uk/download/documents/supporting_documents/Bramley_NP_May2014.pdf During 1935 parts of the film 'The Last Journey'https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0026606/ were shot on the railway within the village. ==Geography== Bramley is located ten miles south of the large town of Reading, and five miles north of Basingstoke. The village is the site of Bramley (Hants) railway station, on the line between Reading and Basingstoke, and is served by Great Western Railway's local services. The station is 5 miles (8 km) north of Basingstoke. ==Governance== The civil parish of Bramley includes the village of Bramley and the neighbouring settlements of Bramley Green and Bramley Corner. The village is also part of the Bramley and Sherfield ward of Basingstoke and Deane borough council. The borough council is a Non-metropolitan district of Hampshire County Council.

Until the Meiji era, a kitchen was also called kamado (; lit. stove) and there are many sayings in the Japanese language that involve kamado as it was considered the symbol of a house. The term could even be used to mean \\"family\\" or \\"household\\" (much as \\"hearth\\" does in English). Separating a family was called kamado wo wakeru, or \\"divide the stove\\". Kamado wo yaburu (lit. \\"break the stove\\") means that the family was broken. ==Early history== In the J≈çmon period, from the 10,000 BC to 300 BC, people gathered into villages, where they lived in shallow pit dwellings. These simple huts were between 10 and 30 square meters and had a hearth in the center. Early stoves were nothing more than a shallow pit (jikaro Âú∞Â∫äÁÇâ), but they were soon surrounded by stones to catch the fire sparks. A bottomless clay vase soon replaced the stones as these became hot quickly and occupants had to be careful around a stove. This type of stove is called umigamero (ÂüãÁîïÁÇâ; lit. \\"buried vase stove\\"). As the stove became safer, it was moved from the center of house to the side and, by the late Kofun period (6th century), almost all houses had a stove at one end of the house. Some rich families in the Kofun period built a separate house where cooking was done. In these houses, food was stored in sacks and pots in a hole dug on the floor. Houses were constructed near a river or a spring for easy access to water. In the Yayoi period (300 BC to AD 250) the cultivation of rice became widespread, and villages would be constructed near a marsh and a lowland. The water was muddy and Asaido (ÊµÖ‰∫ïÊà∏), which means a shallow well, were constructed. An asaido was filled with sand and pebbles through which the water flowed to filter out mud and larger organisms. Some villages stored food outside a house in a large storehouse. The kitchen remained unchanged for over 500 years, between the Nara period in the 8th century until the Muromachi period (1336-1573). Kitchens were furnished with the following items: *Ashikanahe or Ashimarokanahe (Ë∂≥Èáú) - A nine- or ten-legged iron pot. *Kakekanahe or Kakemarokanahe (Êá∏Èáú) - An iron pot that was fitted over a stove. It had a \\"fringe\\" that let it hang on the stove and was used to boil cook rice into kayu. *Yukikamado (Ë°åÁ´à) - A pot, with a stove attached, that could be carried around *Koshiki (Ê©ß or Áîë) - A wooden basket placed on top of a pot to steam cook rice. *Nabe (Â†ù or Èçã) - made of clay or of metal. Primarily used to make stews and a side dish as well as to boil water. *Sashinabe (‰ΩêÂøóÂ•àÈñá) - A small pot with a long handle used to warm sake in a bottle. *Hiraka or Hotogi (Áì´) - A large clay pot, larger than a nabe, used to boil water. *Kamado - Also called Mushikamado: the stove itself, constructed with stones, tiles, and clay. *Karakamado (ÈüìÁ´à) - A set of koshiki, kanahe (Èáú), and kamado that can be carried around. *Takigi (Ëñ™) - In the Nara period, \\"Ëñ™\\" was read as \\"takigi\\" not \\"maki\\". Dried wood was used as fuel. *Oke (È∫ªÁ≠í) - A tub or a pail in three sizes: large, medium, and small. A flat bottomed and shallow tub was also used. *Shaku (Êùì) - Also read as Hisago. A wooden ladle used to scoop cold and hot water from an oke. *Katana (ÂàÄÂ≠ê) - A cooking knife and not a katana. *Kiritsukue or Sekki (ÂàáÊú∫) - A Manaita (‰øé) or a cutting board. *Fune (Ëàπ) - A large wooden tub used for washing. *Shitami (Á±Æ) - A coarse hemp cloth used to squeeze water out or to dry foods by spreading over it. *Kame (Áîï) - A large vase where foods were stored. In the Heian period (794-1185), the first usage of the precursor to \\"daidokoro\\", or pantry, was recorded. The imperial palace of Heian had four rooms dedicated to preparing foods, oni no ma (È¨º„ÅÆÈñì), daibandokoro (Âè∞Áõ§ÊâÄ), asagarei no ma (ÊúùÈ§â„ÅÆÈñì), and ≈åidono (Â§ßÁÇäÊÆø). \\"Oni no ma\\" was the room used for checking for poison and tasting before serving. \\"Asagarei no ma\\" was the room for eating breakfast. \\"≈åidono\\" was the room to cook foods and was placed to the north and as far away as possible from living quarters. \\"Daibandokoro\\" was the room used to serve foods onto a daiban (Âè∞Áõ§), a lacquered wooden table. Maid servants also ate and waited to serve meals in the daibandokoro. Three women cooking in a Japanese cook house Traditional Japanese kitchen, Boso-no-Mura Museum, Inba-gun, Chiba-ken, Japan In the Kamakura period (1185-1333), as the Shoinzukuri style of housing became common, the kitchen was gradually absorbed into the house. Until then, a kitchen was built as a separate house whenever possible to avoid smells and smoke, and to prevent possible kitchen fires from spreading to the primary residence. Kamakura era kitchens did not include essential kitchen furnishings, such as a sink or a well. ==Fire and water== ===Stoves=== A kamado in a traditional Japanese kitchen. The earliest dwellings in Japan used an open fire hearth for cooking. The first stove was recorded in the Kofun period, between the 3rd to 6th century. These stoves, called kamado, were typically made of clay and sand; they were fired through a hole in the front and had a hole in the top, into which a pot could be suspended from its rim. This type of stove remained in use for centuries to come, with only minor modifications. In the 14th century, in the Muromachi period, stoves with two holes were recorded in drawings. By the early 17th century, the beginning of the Edo period, large stoves with several cooking holes were common in the kitchens of the upper-class house as well as in large restaurants. It is believed these multiple hole types appeared earlier than recorded but were omitted from drawings of the time because inclusion of a single hole stove was sufficient to indicate a kitchen. The stove was low, meaning cooks had to squat to cook. In the larger kitchens, especially those of palaces and temples, raised kamado that could be operated while standing up were developed in the Edo period (1603-1867). Irori (Âõ≤ÁÇâË£è„ÄÅ„ÅÑ„Çç„Çä) appeared in the Kofun period and served as a secondary stove. A section of wooden panels were removed from the floor and a lacquered square wooden frame was fitted in the place. The frame was filled with sand and an iron hook was lowered from the ceiling. Foods were reheated or cooked over in an iron pot hung from a hook and the fire served as a heat source. This type of stove became common in many homes by the early Nara period and a smaller irori is the center piece of a tea house. A third type of stove, a hibachi (ÁÅ´Èâ¢, „Å≤„Å∞„Å°) lit. \\"fire pot\\", appeared as late as the early Heian period but is likely to have been used earlier. A hibachi is a deep small pot half filled with sand and ash and a small fire was started in the pot. It was used as a safer form of heating equipment than was available previously and could be used to cook small morsels of food. ===Water=== Elaborate water provisions appear in the background of this mid-1800s illustration Fire was a part of a kitchen from the start, but water was late in becoming a part. In the Yayoi period (300 B.C. to A.D. 250), the cultivation of rice became widespread, and villages would be constructed near a marsh and a lowland. The water was muddy and asaido (ÊµÖ‰∫ïÊà∏) lit.) shallow wells, were constructed. An asaido was filled with sand and pebbles through which the water flowed to filter out mud and larger organisms. A deeper well was also dug and sometimes a hollowed log was inserted into the well to prevent the walls' collapse. A pot was used to scoop water. It was not long before people started improving on these primitive wells. The area around a well was tiled with stones, then fune (Ê∞¥Ëàπ) was invented. Wooden or bamboo shafts were used to carry water from nearby wells and springs to a fune or manually filled by women. Water was carried from these fune to a water vase from where it was used. Sometimes a fune was made inside a house, but it did not have the function of a sink. It was used to collect and store water and nothing more. Fune later became a part of a Japanese garden. The first time that a sink appeared in a drawing was in the Bokie (ÊÖïÂ∏∞Áµµ) written in the early Muromachi period. The kitchen of the Nanrou temple (ÂçóÁÄßÈô¢) had a large sunokoyuka („Åô„ÅÆ„ÅìÂ∫ä) lit. drainboard floor, next to a stove with a water filled oke and hisyaku (syaku) for washing. This sunokoyuka was made with split bamboo and water would drain through gaps between the canes. Even though in many places a sunokoyuka was made over a river and washing was done, to make a part of the kitchen floor into sunokoyuka to use as a drain was an innovation. This did not pose a health problem as kitchen scraps were meticulously collected and used to make a compost. Few Japanese ate meat due to the Emperor's decree in the 8th century and animals and birds were slaughtered away from a house. Until late Edo period, this type of kitchen was widely used. ==Shoin-zukuri and the kitchen== Shoin-zukuri became the standard style of building a house beginning in 13th century and it was revolutionary for combining fire (stove) and water (well and drain) into a single place. It was still few steps short of a kitchen. In the early stage of Shoinzukuri style, instead of the kitchen being a room inside the omoya (ÊØçÂ±ã) or the main building, it was connected by a corridor and existed inside one of many sub- buildings. However, it did have a kamado, a irori, a well, and a sunokoyuka in the same room. In the Edo period (1603 to 1868), daidokoro came to mean \\"kitchen\\" and became an integrated part of the house. It was, however, more common to call it katte (ÂãùÊâã) which is used to mean the \\"back door.\\" The pantry room was called ozenntate (Âæ°ËÜ≥Á´ã). Upper-class houses were well stocked and extremely large by today's standard. The country house of Tokugawa Mitsukuni, known as a gourmet of Edo period, had kitchen spaces at least 34 jyou or about 53 square metres. This is more than one-third of the entire house and does not include the sake storage room or the pantry. Some kitchens had running water by having bamboo shafts connected to the water source extend into the kitchen; users of less well equipped kitchens fetched water from a common well. A separate kitchen within the house had become customary and all but the smallest single-room houses had one. Storage in kitchens was provided by mizuya tansu. These are Japanese style chests, often with a mix of compartments behind sliding doors and drawers of varying sizes. These are still available today as antiques, or altered reproductions tailored to a more modern/western style of kitchen. ==Industrialization== An American scientist, Edward S. Morse, recorded many of the kitchens in urban and rural areas in the early Meiji period (1868‚Äì1912). These kitchens were not much different from those in the Edo period as home use of gas and electricity had only just begun in America and Europe. Though it was costly to lay down infrastructures, these were dutifully laid down, with heavy subsidization by semi-private and national companies. The early 1900s brought a change in Japanese cuisine. Foreign cuisines from every part of the world flooded Japanese cookbooks, part of the haikara boom („Éè„Ç§„Ç´„É©, literally high collared, taken from high-collared coats popular in Europe). Popular dishes like curried rice, sukiyaki, ramen, and gy≈´don appeared during the Meiji period as a part of the haikara movement and represented a fusing of traditional Japanese cuisines with other cuisines. Kitchens were completely reorganized to cook these foods; kitchens of the Edo period were used for simple menus of rice, broiled fish, vegetable soup, and pickled vegetables. The first gas light was installed in Yokohama by 1873, but it would be more than 30 years before advertisements for the gas started appearing in newspapers. These ads were not directed at middle to lower classes. In the 1908 study of how gas was used in Tokyo, 57% was for lighting, 14% was for fuel, 19% was for powering motors, and 3% was for streetlights. This meant that gas was used to light only 1 out of 9 households and only 1 out of 100 households used gas for cooking. Gas companies realized this, and early appliances were directly imported from England which made them too costly for all but the richest citizens. The Japanese kitchen turned away from American and European kitchens at this point. The first item of the industrialization to be introduced to most houses was the gas-heated rice cooker. A gas stove were introduced much later as the cost of gas was still too high for most homes. A gas oven, often an essential part of the kitchen in many American and European houses, never made it into most Japanese households because dishes requiring cooking in an oven, such as roasted chicken and baked pies, became popular only much later. Instead of an oven, a smaller fish oven was fitted into a gas stove. The gas-heated rice cooker remained in use until the 1970s in many houses and was eventually be replaced by the electric rice cooker. In the 1920s, electricity became more widespread in homes in Japan. In Nihonkatei daihyakkajiten (literally Encyclopedia of Japanese Household) published in 1927, there is already an entry of \\"katei denka\\" meaning a completely electric house. It says, :The most important reason to use electricity for all needs of a house, lighting, heat, power is because it will help women to work, increasing their efficiency, make living easier and comfortable, and also make it economical. There must be several electrical outlets in each room to easily use an appliance like electric heater. They also let occupants use electric light at any time and no one can forget the comfort of using appliances like an electric fan, an electric heater, an electric toaster, a coffee maker, an electric iron, and an electric curling iron. :...Placing various electric appliances (in a kitchen) and cooking with them is essential to making it easier to work in this small space. An electric stove, an electric oven, an electric refrigerator, an electric dishwashers, etc. must be wired properly in appropriate spaces. This, however, did not mean that a completely electric house had become common. On 1937, J. G. Douglass from General Electric conducted a half-year research on how many electric appliances made into a common household. According to this report: * Electric iron - 3,131,000 (approximately 120,000 in Tokyo area) * Refrigerator - 12,215 (4,700) * Room cooler - 260 (125) * Vacuum cleaner - 6,610 (3,100) * Washing machine - 3,197 (1,590) This research project also predicted that four years later, in 1941, electric appliances should be much more widely used. A 490% increase was predicted for the refrigerator, 470% increase for the vacuum cleaner, and 150% increase for iron. The first public water service began on October 17, 1887 in Yokohama. By the early 1900s, most major cities had water services. However, these water pipes often led to public water taps. In 1892, a survey conducted in Yokohama revealed that less than 1 in 4 households had a private water tap. 18,184 households used public water taps, while only 5,120 household used private water taps. By the 1930s, most new houses were constructed with a private water taps, but it would take another 30 years to become available in a village far from a city. ==The \\"ordinary person's dream kitchen\\"== In 1912, a progressive woman's magazine Fujin no tomo (Â©¶‰∫∫„ÅÆÂèã) ran a contest for a heiminteki risouno daidokoro (Âπ≥Ê∞ëÁöÑÁêÜÊÉ≥„ÅÆÂè∞ÊâÄ), or \\"ordinary people's sophisticated kitchen.\\" Heimin, literally \\"average person,\\" was a popular phrase in the 1910s and 1920s, and it implied a well-educated and progressive person. Fifty-two contest entries were sent by readers, and two were awarded grand prizes. These winners were called \\"the city kitchen\\" and \\"the village kitchen\\". The city kitchen was about 15.5 square metres in size and was intended to be used by a wife and her mother-in-law. The kitchen had doors leading to the dining room, the bath, and the laundry area. It had a wooden floor, roughly one-fourth of which included underfloor food storage lined with concrete. Two kamado were at one end, and a separate portable stove using charcoal was set up in the middle of the room. Next to the kamado was a stone sink without a water tap. Next to this sink were storage shelves with pots and pans on top, washed dishes in the middle, and vegetables and miso on the bottom. Next to the portable stove was a large food preparation table, with several drawers to store cooking utensils. Staples such as rice, sugar, and flour were kept in pots beneath this table. Additional shelves at the other end of the room could be accessed from both the kitchen and the dining room. Next to these shelves was another preparation table where foods were served onto individual dishes and then carried to the dining room. Kitchen windows and shoji were installed with glass panes to make the kitchen brighter, and electric lights were hung from the ceiling. This \\"dream kitchen\\" was spacious by today's standards, yet it lacked most modern post-industrial conveniences, although many smaller improvements had been made. Also around this time, many families started to use a low table called chabudai. Everyone sat around it, rather than using individual daiban. Until the 1960s, sitting on chairs and eating around a dining table was considered \\"haikara\\". ==The kitchen in the Taish≈ç period== In the Taish≈ç period (1912-1926), a popular movement called \\"Taish≈ç Democracy\\" began. Its main focus was on universal suffrage for males, and this movement extended into other fields, serving as a modernization effort similar to the Meiji Restoration. The kitchen was affected. Before the Taish≈ç period, the kitchen was constructed so that most tasks could be done while sitting, crouching, or kneeling. This was due to long preparation and cooking times and helped keep the stove low to prevent the spread of fire. As gas stoves and European-style clothes became popular, kitchens were redesigned so they could be used while standing. A second innovation was that instead of placing the stove and water sink in a sunken, dirt-floored section of the kitchen, the stove was constructed on the same level as the rest of the kitchen, eliminating the need for stepping into footwear to attend it. In 1922, Suzuki Shougyou began marketing a customizable kitchen set that came to be called the \\"System Kitchen.\\" Many of its parts were prefabricated, and it could be made to fit in a space anywhere from 1.8 to 2.7 metres, the length of one to one-and-one-half tatami mats. The System Kitchen had a water sink, a cutting board, two or more gas stoves (not included), and cabinets for storage. This Suzuki kitchen was expensive, costing 120 yen at a time when a first-year bank worker earned only 50 yen per month. Today the same worker earns over 240,000 yen or about 2,400 dollars in a month. By the end of the Taish≈ç period, it was becoming increasingly difficult to have a maid to help around the house. This means that the kitchen had to be smaller for a housewife working alone. Whereas a European Frankfurt kitchen measured 1.9m by 3.4m, or 6.46 square metres, Japanese pushed for an even smaller size, 1 tsubo or 3.3 square metres, the area of two tatami mats. Three sides of these kitchens were filled with cupboards, stoves, storage areas, and a water sink. ==The post-war kitchen== Many Japanese houses were destroyed in World War II. Rebuilding allowed architects to freely redesign houses as well as kitchens. The influence of Edo-period lifestyles was now nearly gone. Electricity and gas were built into kitchens, and designs reflected this change. An electric refrigerator, a luxury item before the war, became a standard item in the 1950s, along with an electric washing machine and a black-and-white television. However, early post-war housing projects were often poorly designed. Sometimes architects simply copied plans for American or European housing projects, with only minor modifications to better suit Japanese families. Kitchens were small and soon became cluttered with new electric appliances. The \\"System Kitchen\\" approach to design was intended to make the kitchen easier for the average housewife to use. Since most families cook many types of cuisine in their kitchens, a streamlined cooking process was studied, focusing on how the kitchen was actually used. In a system kitchen, the refrigerator and other electrical appliances were placed in predesigned locations, and storage spaces were subdivided to house pots, pans and kitchen utensils. ==Contemporary== A typical Japanese kitchen. A typical modern Japanese kitchen includes the following: * Counter: Countertop is usually made of cultured marble, but wood or natural stone is used for higher-end kitchens and stainless steel are used for commercial or lower-end kitchens. * Large sink * Cabinets * Refrigerator and freezer: Especially in smaller kitchens for apartments, the top is usually low enough to use as an additional surface, particularly for appliances, similar to Western dormitory-sized refrigerator/freezers. In larger kitchens, full height refrigerators are common. * Gas or induction stove: In smaller kitchens, there are only one or two burners, while more often it is three to four burners, with a narrow grill underneath for fish or vegetables. In the low-end apartments, stoves are often not built-in but rather a counter-top appliance, which is attached with a hose to a gas or power outlet. In case of earthquakes, the gas tap is to be turned off to prevent fires. * Electric rice cooker: Over 95% of Japanese houses have one. * Electric water boiler or kettle, particularly for making tea, but also instant ramen * Toaster oven * Microwave oven or convection microwave * Extractor hood or fan Notably absent are large ovens and dishwashers. Large gas ovens are found in some kitchens, particularly in higher-end dwellings, but in most kitchens, convection microwaves are used instead. Dishwashers can commonly be found in the kitchens of houses and condominiums, but rarely in apartments. Portable vacuum flasks are popular for carrying home-brewed tea, particularly hot tea in the winter and cold tea in the summer, particularly cold oolong tea. ==See also== *Mizuya *Kamado *Housing in Japan *Japanese cooking tools category ==References== ==External links== *Entry for daidokoro at JAANUS (Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System). *JAANUS entry for kamado (stove), with a good image. *Kamado Barbecues Kitchen * Category:Kitchen ja:Âè∞ÊâÄ ","title":"Japanese kitchen"},{"id":"844526","text":"Tower Hill is an area of Great Barr, Birmingham, England. It is situated on the western side of the main A34 road that links Birmingham with Walsall, and straddles the Tame Valley Canal.

It was in the county of Warwickshire. The area is in the Sutton Vesey ward. ==History== In the 16th century, this area of barren common land was known as the Wyld and was sparsely populated. After the Enclosure Act of 1825, there was some development and in 1840 the growth of the population to about 60 led to the building of the first school.Wylde Green Primary School In the 1850s substantial Victorian mansions began to appear along the Birmingham Road. Highbridge Road and Station Road were laid out in 1858 in anticipation of the coming of the railway. The railway with its station at Wylde Green railway station opened in 1862 (now on the Birmingham to Lichfield suburban line). Urbanisation of the area proceeded rapidly thereafter. In 1923, the parish of Wylde Green was created out of that of Boldmere.The borough of Sutton Coldfield - A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 4: Hemlingford Hundred (1947), pp. 230-245. Date accessed: 25 January 2008. In 1974 Sutton Coldfield, of which Wylde Green is a part, became part of the City of Birmingham. A consultative ballot in 2015 led to the formation of Royal Sutton Coldfield Town Council Royal Sutton Coldfield Town Council https://www.suttoncoldfieldtowncouncil.gov.uk/the-council/. The role of this organisation is the same as a parish council. Wylde Green falls under its authority. Until recently there was a 1950s disused nuclear bunker that would have played a key role in the control of the Birmingham area in the event of a nuclear attack.Wylde Green - 4 Group, 74 Brigade AAOR serving the Birmingham GDA ==Geography== Wylde Green is situated on the south side of Sutton Coldfield, bordering the Chester Road district of north Erdington, Birmingham and the Pype Hayes district to the southeast . To the north is Beeches Walk (an informal boundary between it and the Maney area that heralds the start of the town centre of Sutton Coldfield). To the south is the Chester Road crossroads, near to the Yenton Public House, beyond which is Erdington. To the east across New Hall Valley is Walmley, and on the west is Boldmere. ==Housing and facilities== Much of the housing dates from the 1930s, late 1940s and 1950s. Much of the area is a middle-working class suburb, with small pockets of affluence. There is one tower block located within Wylde Green, Heron Court, which is behind The Lanes Shopping Centre, which also has flats above retail floors. Wylde Green Road, the road to Walmley, was noted for having a ford across Plants Brook until around 1967. Within the valley are New Hall Valley Country Park and Plantsbrook Nature Reserve. Also on the Wylde Green Road is a cottage which used to look over the ford. It was called the Fordkeeper's Cottage and was built by Bishop Vesey.Houses of the valley, houses of interest at Wylde Green crossing of Plants Brook, A.F.

Professional ethics encompass the personal and corporate standards of behavior expected by professionals.Royal Institute of British Architects - Code of professional conduct The word professionalism originally applied to vows of a religious order. By no later than the year 1675, the term had seen secular application and was applied to the three learned professions: Divinity, Law, and Medicine. The term professionalism was also used for the military profession around this same time. Professionals and those working in acknowledged professions exercise specialist knowledge and skill. How the use of this knowledge should be governed when providing a service to the public can be considered a moral issue and is termed professional ethics.Ruth Chadwick (1998). Professional Ethics. In E. Craig (Ed.), Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. London: Routledge. Retrieved October 20, 2006, from https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/professional-ethics/v-1 It is capable of making judgments, applying their skills, and reaching informed decisions in situations that the general public cannot because they have not attained the necessary knowledge and skills.Caroline Whitbeck, \\"Ethics in Engineering Practice and Research\\" Cambridge University Press, 1998 page 40 One of the earliest examples of professional ethics is the Hippocratic oath to which medical doctors still adhere to this day. ==Components== Some professional organizations may define their ethical approach in terms of a number of discrete components.RICS- MAINTAINING PROFESSIONAL AND ETHICAL STANDARDS Typically these include Honesty, Trustworthiness, Transparency, Accountability, Confidentiality, Objectivity, Respect, Obedience to the law, and Loyalty. ==Implementation== Most professionals have internally enforced codes of practice that members of the profession must follow to prevent exploitation of the client and to preserve the integrity and reputation of the profession. This is not only for the benefit of the client but also for the benefit of those belonging to that profession. Disciplinary codes allow the profession to define a standard of conduct and ensure that individual practitioners meet this standard, by disciplining them from the professional body if they do not practice accordingly. This allows those professionals who act with a conscience to practice in the knowledge that they will not be undermined commercially by those who have fewer ethical qualms. It also maintains the public‚Äôs trust in the profession, encouraging the public to continue seeking their services. ===Internal regulation=== In cases where professional bodies regulate their own ethics, there are possibilities for such bodies to become self-serving and fail to follow their own ethical code when dealing with renegade members. This is particularly true of professions in which they have almost a complete monopoly on a particular area of knowledge. For example, until recently, the English courts deferred to the professional consensus on matters relating to their practice that lay outside case law and legislation.Margaret Brazier, ‚Äò‚ÄôMedicine, Patients and the Law‚Äô‚Äô, Penguin, 1987 page 147 ==Statutory regulation== In many countries there is some statutory regulation of professional ethical standards such as the statutory bodies that regulate nursing and midwifery in England and Wales.The Bristol Royal Infirmary inquiry-Professional regulation - nursing: the UKCC Failure to comply with these standards can thus become a matter for the courts. ==Examples== For example, a lay member of the public should not be held responsible for failing to act to save a car crash victim because they could not give an appropriate emergency treatment. Though, they are responsible for attempting to get help for the victim. This is because they do not have the relevant knowledge and experience. In contrast, a fully trained doctor (with the correct equipment) would be capable of making the correct diagnosis and carrying out appropriate procedures. Failure of a doctor to not help at all in such a situation would generally be regarded as negligent and unethical. Though, if a doctor helps and makes a mistake that is considered negligent and unethical, there could be egregious repercussions. An untrained person would only be considered to be negligent for failing to act if they did nothing at all to help and is protected by the \\"Good Samaritan\\" laws if they unintentionally caused more damage and possible loss of life. A business may approach a professional engineer to certify the safety of a project which is not safe. While one engineer may refuse to certify the project on moral grounds, the business may find a less scrupulous engineer who will be prepared to certify the project for a bribe, thus saving the business the expense of redesigning.Michael Davis, ‚ÄòThinking like an Engineer‚Äô in Philosophy and Public Affairs, 20.2 (1991) page 158 Some corporations have tried to burnish their ethical image by creating whistle-blower protections, such as anonymity. In the case of Citi, they call this the Ethics Hotline. Though it is unclear whether firms such as Citi take offences reported to these hotlines seriously or not. ===Separatism=== On a theoretical level, there is debate as to whether an ethical code for a profession should be consistent with the requirements of morality governing the public. Separatists argue that professions should be allowed to go beyond such confines when they judge it necessary. This is because they are trained to produce certain outcomes which may take moral precedence over other functions of society. For example, it could be argued that a doctor may lie to a patient about the severity of his or her condition if there is reason to believe that telling the patient would cause so much distress that it would be detrimental to his or her health. This would be a disrespect of the patient's autonomy, as it denies the patient information that could have a great impact on his or her life. This would generally be seen as morally wrong. However, if the end of improving and maintaining health is given a moral priority in society, then it may be justifiable to contravene other moral demands in order to meet this goal. Separatism is based on a relativist conception of morality that there can be different, equally valid, moral codes that apply to different sections of society and differences in codes between societies (see moral relativism). If moral universalism is ascribed to, then this would be inconsistent with the view that professions can have a different moral code, as the universalist holds that there is only one valid moral code for all.. ==Student ethics== As attending college after high school graduation becomes a standard in the lives of young people, colleges and universities are becoming more business-like in their expectations of the students. Although people have differing opinions about if it is effective, surveys state that it is the overall goal of the university administrators. Setting up a business-like atmosphere helps students get adjusted from a more relaxed nature, like high school, towards what will be expected of them in the business world upon graduating from College. ===Codes of conduct=== Codes of conduct, such as the St. Xavier Code of Conduct, are becoming more a staple in the academic lives of students. While some of these rules are based solely on academics others are more in depth than in previous years. Such as, detailing the level of respect expected towards staff and gambling. Not only do codes of conduct apply while attending the schools at home, but also while studying abroad. Schools also implement a code of conduct for international study abroad programs which carry over many of the same rules found in most student handbooks. ==See also== * Business ethics * Deontological ethics * Ethical code * Ethics * Engineering ethics * Legal ethics * Medical ethics * Nursing ethics * Outline of ethics * Professional * Professional abuse * Professional boundaries * Professional negligence in English Law * Professional responsibility * Virtue ethics ==References== ==Further reading== * Values, morals, and ethics.

Four Oaks has a population of 21,690 as of 2004, and is part of the Sutton Four Oaks electoral ward. ==Four Oaks Estate== In 1677, Henry Folliott, 1st Baron Folliott of Ballyshannon bought of woodland and built Four Oaks Hall. Folliott died in 1716, but his widow continued to live in Four Oaks Hall until her death in 1751. The estate was sold to Simon Luttrell, 1st Earl of Carhampton, who remodelled and modernised the house. In 1757, he bought a further of woodland to annex his estate and form a deer park. He sold the estate to Thomas Gresley in 1778, who sold the estate to Sir Hugh Bateman, 1st Baronet of Hartington Hall in 1785, who in turn sold the estate to Sir Edmund Cradock-Hartopp, 1st Baronet in 1792. In 1827, Hartopp bought of woodland to further increase the size of the deer park. The estate was sold to Hubert de Burgh-Canning, 2nd Marquess of Clanricarde for residential development in 1868. Roads were named to commemorate the history of the estate, and between 1895 and 1915 approximately 200 houses were built on the estate, forming Four Oaks Estate. The neglected and dilapidated Four Oaks Hall was demolished in 1898, and the site is now occupied by Carhampton House. Four Oaks Estate is a mainly residential area with the Four Oaks Tennis Club at its heart, approximately enclosed by Lichfield Road, Four Oaks Road, Sutton Park and Sutton Park Line railway line. One of the most expensive residential areas in the West Midlands, the Park's private roads are home to some of the region's wealthiest residents. Four Oaks Park is characterised by its large houses and tree-lined, speed-humped roads. The houses on the Estate are individually designed by prominent architects such as Charles Bateman, and most sell at over ¬£1 million. Many of the houses have received listed building status. Four Oaks Estate is also home to Four Oaks Tennis Club, which was founded in 1906. The private roads on Four Oaks Estate are owned by Four Oaks Estate Ltd and run by a formally constituted Residents Association that elects a Secretary & Treasurer to manage its affairs. Four Oaks Estate Ltd submitted in 2019 a planning application 2019/03339/PA to Birmingham Council, that is yet to be determined, to create a large exclusive gated community consisting of 340 houses, by installing 8 sets of perimeter gates on the 8 private road entrance points into the private residential estate. A similar planning application at the neighbouring Little Aston Park similar exclusive private residential estate 1 mile away was recently Refused at a Lichfield Council Planning Committee meeting, and subsequent Planning Inspectorate Appeal Dismissed, as to create a large exclusive gated community would undermine social cohesion by creating social segregation. ==Transport== West Midlands Trains operate a frequent train service from Four Oaks railway station to Lichfield and Redditch on the Cross-City Line via Birmingham New Street and the University of Birmingham. There are also four bus services through Four Oaks operated by National Express West Midlands.

Chambers was dubbed the Preppy Killer by the media after the August 26, 1986, New York City Central Park strangulation death of 18-year-old Jennifer Levin, for which he was originally charged with second degree murder. He claimed the death was accidental and the result of rough sex, and later pleaded guilty to manslaughter at the end of his trial. == Early life == Chambers was accepted by Boston University, where he completed one semester but was asked to leave because of difficulties, one involving a stolen credit card. He subsequently committed other petty thefts and burglaries in connection with his drug and alcohol abuse. Unable to hold a job, he was issued a summons for disorderly conduct one night after leaving Dorrian's Red Hand, a bar located at 300 East 84th Street in Manhattan. Chambers destroyed the summons as the police were leaving the scene, yelling, \\"You fucking cowards, you should stick to niggers!\\" == Killing of Jennifer Levin == === Background === Levin and Chambers briefly dated. The day of the murder, both were at Dorrian's Red Hand. === Finding of the body === Jennifer Levin's half-naked corpse, covered in dust, and bite marks, was found by a cyclist in Central Park near Fifth Avenue and 83rd Street, behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Clothing from Levin's upper body had been pushed up around her neck, and her skirt was around her waist. The medical examiner's office determined she had been strangled. Police noted there were numerous cuts and bruises on her neck, both from the strangulation and from her own fingernails as she clawed at her killer's hands. Later, Chambers hid and watched as police officers surveyed the scene. Investigators found Levin's underwear some away. ===Arrest and trial=== As he was Levin's boyfriend, police apprehended him for interrogation. Afterward they noticed the numerous scratches on his arms and face, which he blamed on his cat before admitting Levin and he separated after leaving the bar, with her going to buy smokes. On being told she wasn't a smoker, he claimed she died during an aggressive sexual encounter in the park. Before booking, Chambers was permitted to see his father, to whom he said, \\"That fucking bitch, why didn't she leave me alone?\\" Archbishop Theodore Edgar McCarrick of Newark, New Jersey, later Archbishop of Washington, wrote a letter of support for Chambers' bail application. He had known Chambers and his mother because she had been employed as a nurse by Cardinal Terence Cooke. McCarrick was close to the Chambers family and had served as Robert's godfather at his baptism. In 2019, he was defrocked for sexual crimes against adults and minors. Chambers had secured bail through his family and the owner of the bar, Jack Dorrian, who put up his townhouse as collateral for a bail bond. Chambers was charged with, and tried for, two counts of second-degree murder. His defense was that Levin's death had occurred during \\"rough sex\\". He was defended by Jack Litman, who had previously used the temporary insanity defense on behalf of Richard Herrin for the murder of Yale University student Bonnie Garland. Litman claimed Levin was promiscuous, telling she had a sex diary and that her sexual history was admissible as evidence, prompting headlines such as \\"How Jennifer Courted Death\\" (Daily News). On remand, he was filmed twisting off the head of a Barbie doll and saying \\"Oops, I think I killed her\\". Prosecutor Linda Fairstein stated: \\"In more than 8,000 cases of reported assaults in the last ten years, this is the first in which a male reported being sexually assaulted by a female.\\" When the jury failed to reach a verdict after nine days of deliberation, the prosecution had to allow Chambers to plead guilty for manslaughter, and he received a sentence of 15 years. == Post-conviction== In 1997, Chambers sent an untitled essay he wrote to prison anthologist Jeff Evans. The piece, subsequently titled \\"Christmas: Present\\", appeared in the book, Undoing Time: American Prisoners in Their Own Words.Northeastern University Press, 2001 Written while Chambers was incarcerated at Green Haven Correctional Facility in Stormville, New York, the essay is an entry from one of his journals, which he calls \\"a record of the meaningless hope and frightening losses of a person I don't even know\\". Chambers was released from Auburn Prison on February 14, 2003, after having served the entirety of his prison term due to his numerous infractions. His release was a media circus, with reporters staking out prime sections of the sidewalk opposite the prison as early as thirteen hours before his 7:30 a.m. release time. The same day, the NBC News program Dateline NBC interviewed Chambers, who continued to claim that he strangled Levin accidentally in an attempt to stop her from hurting him during rough sex. He also falsely denied that he had been disciplined in prison. The owner of Dorrian's Red Hand settled with Levin's parents on their claim that the bar where Levin and Chambers had been before they went to Central Park on the night of her death had served too much alcohol to Chambers. A wrongful death lawsuit, which Chambers did not contest, provides that he must pay all lump sums he receives, including any income from book or movie deals, plus ten percent of his future income (up to $25 million), to the Levin family. The family has said all the money it gets from Chambers will go to victims' rights organizations.Wolfe, Linda. Wasted: The Preppie Murder. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1989. ==Drug charges== Chambers pleaded guilty in July 2005, and on August 29 was sentenced to a reduced sentence of 90 days in jail and fined $200 for the license violation. The judge added ten days to the time prosecutors and Chambers' lawyer had agreed on because Chambers was an hour late for the hearing. He had faced up to a year in jail if he had been convicted after trial. On October 22, 2007, Chambers was arrested again, this time in his own apartment, and charged with three counts of selling a controlled substance in the first degree, three counts of selling a controlled substance in the second degree, and one count of resisting arrest. Kovell was also arrested on one count of selling a controlled substance in the second degree. The New York Daily News reported: > Cops said Chambers, 41, struggled with officers who tried to handcuff him on > the felony charges. One detective suffered a broken thumb in the fracas. Commenting on his new arrest, former Assistant District Attorney Linda Fairstein, who had prosecuted Chambers for Levin's death, said: > Doesn't surprise me. I always believed his problem with drugs and alcohol > would get him in trouble again. He's had the opportunity in prison to detox > and take college courses, to straighten out his life, but that clearly is of > no interest to him. He's learned nothing in the last 20 years. Chambers and Kovell were charged with running a cocaine operation out of the apartment. The two had previously been given notices for not paying rent, and the phone had been disconnected. Chambers appeared in court on December 18; according to the New York Post, his lawyer filed \\"new papers elaborating on his psychiatric defense\\". The filing claimed that Chambers had become an addict at the age of 14 and was, by 2007, using ten to twelve bags of heroin a day. It was also reported that he also used cocaine, was smoking marijuana and taking prescription drugs. Chambers planned to plead insanity. Prosecutors countered that Chambers was a drug dealer and had sold as much as $2,800 in heroin at a time to undercover police. Chambers faced life in prison on the drug charges. On August 11, 2008, the Manhattan DA's office announced that Chambers had pleaded guilty to selling drugs. On September 2, 2008, he was sentenced to 19 years on the drug charge.http://www.wnbc.com/news/17370538/detail.html As of March 2019, he is at Sullivan Correctional Facility, New York State Department of Corrections DIN (Department Identification Number) #08A4763. His earliest release date from prison is January 25, 2024; his maximum release date is October 15, 2026. ==In popular culture== *The Sonic Youth song \\"Eliminator Jr.\\", from their 1988 album Daydream Nation (1988) is about the Chambers case. *The song \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\\" in The Killers' album Hot Fuss (2004) was inspired by Chambers' defense of the Jennifer Levin murder charges, in which Chambers claimed he had no motive for the murder, and that he and the victim were \\"friends\\". *In 1989, the Chambers case was the basis of a TV movie titled The Preppie Murder, starring William Baldwin as Chambers and Lara Flynn Boyle as Levin. *In 1990, the television series Law & Order based the episode \\"Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die\\" on the case. *Mike Doyle has stated that his character, Adam Guenzel on Oz, (1997‚Äì2003) was based on Chambers. *The 2003 Law & Order: Criminal Intent episode \\"Monster\\" was based on both the Chambers case and the Central Park Jogger case. *In the novel American Psycho, protagonist Patrick Bateman - wealthy, preppy serial killer - mentions trying to start a defense fund for Chambers. *In the collection Shock Treatment by Karen Finley, Chambers is mentioned twice. *AMC aired a five-part mini-series The Preppy Murder: Death in Central Park on November 13, 2019. == References == ==Further reading== * Benedict, Helen.

It is south of the city centre and includes the area of Billesley and much of Yardley Wood as well as the Hollybank Road area of Kings Heath. It is contiguous with the Birmingham wards of Highter's Heath on the south-west, Brandwood and Kings Heath on the west, Moseley on the north and Hall Green South on the east. To the south-east is the Shirley West ward of Solihull. The suburb of Billesley is the area bordered by Billesley Common, Chinn Brook Meadows, The Dingles and Swanshurst Park (although some streets within this area favour the broader B13 moniker of Moseley). The expansion of this area began in 1921 with the commencement of construction of the Billesley Estates. Two districts began to form within Billesley; one on the former Ivy House Farm (north of Trittiford Rd) and the other on the former Billesley Farm (south of Trittiford Rd). By 1926, between 15 and 20 families were moving into Billesley each week and it became one of Birmingham's first council estates.Brum and Brummies: Vol 2, Carl Chinn, 2001, Brewin Books () ==Etymology== The name derives from an Anglo-Saxon named Bill who established himself within the area. -Ley means \\"woodland clearing\\" and a woodland clearing is known to have existed in Billesley north of Chinn Brook. ==Demography== The 2001 Population Census found that 25,874 people were living in the area with a population density of 4,537 people per km¬≤ compared with 3,649 people per km¬≤ for Birmingham.

It also contains a road of the same name. It is also a ward in the formal district of Hodge Hill. Neighbouring areas include, Alum Rock, Saltley, Small Heath and Yardley. Heartlands Hospital is located in the eastern part of Bordesley Green. The area is also served by Yardley Green Medical Centre and Omnia Practice. Kingfisher Country Park covers the River Cole recreation grounds which are partially covered by the area's boundaries. Bordesley Green has a larger Eastern European community including Romanians, Poles, and Russians settling in the area, but it is still predominantly South Asian. ==History== The name of this part of Birmingham is derived from an ancient area of demesne pasture, listed in early records dating back to 1285 as La Grene de Bordeslei. The area began to be built up in 1834, with scattered developments from Bordesley along Bordesley Green from the junction of Cattell Road and Garrison Lane as far east as Blake Lane. By 1906 urban development had spread eastwards as far as Blakesland Street and Mansell Road and included a fire station and police station, both of which survive, though the fire station no longer serves its original purpose and the police station is now a hostel for homeless people. The old fire station in Bordesley Green Many roads in Bordesley Green were built not long after the Boer War at the end of the 19th century and were named to commemorate the hundreds of soldiers from Birmingham that died in that war. Examples include Pretoria Road, named after the capital of the Boer republic of the Transvaal; Churchill Road, after Winston Churchill who fought in the Boer War, was captured but escaped; Botha Road, named after the Boer general who became the first prime minister of the Union of South Africa; and Colonial Road. Many late-Victorian and Edwardian houses remain in Bordesley Green and much of the area has physically changed little since then. ===Industrial Hub=== At the turn of the twentieth century Bordesley Green had become a district noted for industry and manufacturing. It was the home of the Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company, which had a manufacturing plant in Bordesley from 1901 to 1920 where motor cars and machine tools were built. The National Telephone Company also stationed one of its main depots in Bordesley Green's Fordrough Lane, a plant which was to become one of the three major General Post Office (GPO) factories in Birmingham. The Fordrough Lane GPO factory specialised in manual telephony, including factory repaired telephones, \\"candlestick\\" ‚Äòphones, switchboards and associated components. The factory played a significant role in the development of the Colossus computer which was used to read encrypted German messages in World War II. In the 1960s, the HANDEL Nuclear Attack Warning equipment, known as the four minute warning was manufactured in Bordesley Green, along with equipment for regional seats of government, which were part of Britain's civil defence preparations for nuclear war. ===Blitz=== Bordesley Green was targeted during the Blitzkrieg with five raids hitting the area. The last German bomb to hit Birmingham landed on 24 April 1943 and hit Bordesley Green. The GPO factory was also hit by German bombing raids in 1940. ==Wildlife== ===Tumbling Pigeons=== In the 1920s a Bordesley Green bus driver and pigeon fancier, William Penson, noticed one of his birds perform a backflip while in flight, and through selective breeding produced the Roller and Tumbler breed of pigeon. This breed is noted for its unique acrobatics while in flight and is used in ‚Äòparlour rolling‚Äô contests. Today there are hundreds of Birmingham Roller clubs around the world and fiercely fought competitions to pick the birds that perform the most dramatic tumbling. ==Geology== The bedrock geology of the area consists predominantly of Sidmouth Mudstone Formation. Sedimentary Bedrock formed approximately 228 to 250 million years ago in the Triassic Period. The local environment was previously dominated by hot deserts. The types of sedimentary rocks in the Bordesley area are fluvial, lacustrine and marine in origin. They would have been detrital, deposited in lagoons or shallow seas, where a hot, arid climate would have led to the precipitation of beds of evaporites. The superficial deposits tend to be glaciofluvial in origin, Mid Pleistocene - Sand And Gravel. Superficial Deposits in area were formed up to 2 million years ago in the Quaternary Period. The Bordesley environment would have been dominated by ice age conditions. The deposits are detrital, generally coarse-grained, forming beds, channels, plains and fans associated with meltwater.http://mapapps.bgs.ac.uk/geologyofbritain/home.html?location=b9 ===Lost brook of Bordesley Green=== Early maps of the area show a brook which extended from Shaw Hill down to Bordesley Green Road, which is now mostly submerged, with the exception of a small section which emerges from a culvert in Bordesley Green. It is called Washbrook. It‚Äôs starts up near garrison lane then flows through the South African Estate, on through the allotments. It is open in Ward End Park then on into the River Tame at Bromford. ==Demography== In 2001, an estimated 31,343 people were living in the ward making it the second most populous ward, behind Sparkbrook.Birmingham Economy: Population This increased to 33,937 by the time of the 2011 Population Census.

The other 0.3% lived in communal establishments. The total number of occupied households in the ward was 9,350. This results in an average of number of people per household of 3.3, higher than the city of 2.5 and national average of 2.4. The majority of households are owner occupied (58%). 20.6% of occupied households are rented from Birmingham City Council, above the city average of 19.4%. 337 houses were identified as being vacant.

At 25.4%, semi-detached houses were the second most common form of housing. The area is home to an ethnically diverse community and ethnic minorities comprise 71.1% of the population compared to 29.6% for Birmingham overall. 33.5% of the population was born outside of the United Kingdom, much higher than the city average of 16.5% and the national average of 9.3%. 62.2% of the population was of Asian origin, of which 50.5% were British Pakistanis. The proportion of Asian people in Birmingham is much lower at 19.5% and the proportion of Pakistani people is 10.6%. White British people represented 25.7% of the ward's population. There is a wide variety of languages spoken within the area such as Punjabi, Urdu, Mirpuri, Bengali, Pushto and Arabic with English being the most widely spoken language. The most dominant religion in the ward was Islam with 59.4% of the population stating themselves as Muslims, above the average for Birmingham of 14.3% and the national average of 3.1%. Christianity was the second largest religion in the ward with 27.1% of the ward's population stating themselves as Christians. The ethnic minorities of Bordesley Green are particularly concentrated in the Victorian and Edwardian terraced houses, having emigrated to the area from the Commonwealth during the 1950s and 1960s. The 25‚Äì44 age group represented the greatest portion of all age groups at 27.3%. At 22.2%, the 5‚Äì15 age group was the second largest. The proportion of the population that was of a pensionable age was 11.7%, below the city average of 16.7% and the national average of 18.4%. The proportion of people of a working age was 54.9%, below the city average of 59.8% and national average of 61.5%.

The Birmingham Heartlands & Solihull Trust is the largest employer in the area, employing approximately 5,000 people. South Birmingham College is the second largest employer, employing around 850 people.Birmingham Economy: Bordesley Green Several hundred terraced houses around Bordesley Green dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries were demolished in the early 1990s and new houses built on their site as part of a \\"New homes for old\\" initiative which allowed people to remain living in areas that their families had lived in for generations. ==Politics== The Bordesley Green Ward was created in June 2004 out of the Small Heath and Sparkbrook wards. However the 2004 Council Election was marred by vote rigging by the Labour Party candidates, who were subsequently removed from the Council. Conservatives have in recent years gained support in the Bordesley Green area. It is represented at the Birmingham City Council by three Labour councillor; Shafique Shah (Labour), Mohammed Aikhlaq (Labour) and Uzma Ahmed (Labour). Bordesley Green has adopted a Ward Support Officer. The current holder of the title is Tracey Arthurs. ==Bordesley Village== Bordesley Green has an associated village, Bordesley Village, within its ward, offering considerably better housing. The village is often referred as a separate area, and attempts are being made to separate the two to distinguish the areas. The village is also home to the City's football team, Birmingham City FC, built before the village was established from an old gypsy encampment and scrap yard. Recently, the village has seen several additions, becoming the hub of the city's new car sales, with premium firms such as Mercedes Benz, Audi & Infiniti, as well as Volkswagen & Seat and many more including motorcycle firms Heine Gericke & Triumph. The village is also served by several small shops, such as newsagents, a pharmacy and has its own dentist and doctors surgery. The village also caters for the needs of shoppers, offering a Morrisons supermarket & fuel station and Iceland, as well as fashion outlets such as JD, Bank, Topshop and other shops such as Toys R Us, Poundland, B&M; and many more national companies within walking distance of the village. The Village concept in Bordesley Green was the first \\"Ideal Village\\" in England, built between 1908 and 1914 by Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin. The pair eventually went on to build Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire. The villages were a welcome relief to English cities at the time and the homes were built to high standards. Daniels Road in Bordesley Green commemorates schoolteacher Francis Daniels. Originally from Ebley near Stroud, Daniels came to Birmingham in 1891 and soon saw the need to provide affordable social security for ordinary working people. With the Lord Mayor, Alderman William Kendrick as president and Daniels himself as general secretary, the Ideal Society was formed. By 1910 the society had moved into housing provision and commenced the building of the Ideal Village at Bordesley Green, where Finnemore Road also commemorates an early chairman of the society, William Finnemore. The first houses to be built were in Drummond Road. The village, which was designed for artisan workers, has shops, a park and a school and a much lower density of housing than the nearby terraces. St Paul's Mission, built in 1912 in Finnemore Road as a chapel of St Margaret's Ward End, was consecrated as a parish church in 1929. A new church was built c1970 in Belchers Lane behind the old, which was retained as the church hall. The church is now the centre of a community project embracing a number of different facilities and services. In 1998 children from Bordesley Green Primary School discovered the origin of a badly damaged stone fountain in the Ideal Park which commemorates the rescue by a local boy of a drowning girl. On 7 May 1907 16-year-old cycle polisher, Harold Clayfield of 11 Ronald Road, jumped into a 5m deep clay pit at the junction of Belchers Lane and Bordesley Green to save 4-year-old, Florence Jones. The girl was saved, but non-swimmer Clayfield, drowned. His memorial was paid for by public subscription. Sadly Florence herself was to die only four years later as a result of playing with burning pieces of paper at her home in Green Lane. ==Public art== The area features public art with the installation of Ondr√© Nowakowski's Sleeping Iron Giant, a large head lying on its side on a mound near the St Andrew's football ground. ==Skate park== Bordesley Green has one skate park, known locally as the Pod. It is popular with mini BMX Rocker riders. ==Bordesley Green Allotments== The historic Bordesley Green Allotments is a 25-acre site that is host to the Bordesley Green Forest garden and in 2012 was the venue for the Birmingham Annual Gardening Show which is normally held in Kings Heath Park. ==Education== ===Primary schools=== *Alston Junior and Infants Primary School *Bordesley Green Junior and Infants Primary School *Wyndcliffe Primary School ===Secondary schools=== *Bordesley Green Girls' School *Saltley Academy ===Further education=== *South and City College Birmingham ‚Äì Bordesley Green Campus ==Health== * Heartlands Hospital * Yardley Green Medical Centre * Omnia Practice ==References== ==External links== *2001 Population census information: Ward profiles *Birmingham City Council: Bordesley Green Ward Category:Areas of Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Wards of Birmingham, West Midlands ","title":"Bordesley Green"},{"id":"844555","text":"==Novel== Winner: *Gerda Charles, The Destiny Waltz ==Biography== Winner: *Michael Meyer, Henrik Ibsen ==Poetry== Winner: *Geoffrey Hill, Mercian Hymns ==References== *Previous winners Whitbread Category:Costa Book Awards Whitbread Awards ","title":"1971 Whitbread Awards"},{"id":"844556","text":"Floodway may refer to: *Flood bypass *Flood control channel *Floodway (road), a flood plain crossing for a road *The community of Floodway, Arkansas ","title":"Floodway"},{"id":"844559","text":"==Book of the Year== Winner: *David Lodge, How Far Can You Go? ==Children's Book== Winner: *Leon Garfield, John Diamond ==Novel== Winner: *David Lodge, How Far Can You Go? ==Biography== Winner: *David Newsome, On the Edge of Paradise: A.

It is often made in the traditional Ghanaian, Nigerian and Cuba method by mixing and pounding separate equal portions of cassava and green plantain flour thoroughly with water. It is then adjusted to either increase or decrease the viscosity of the fufu depending on personal preferences. Other flours, such as semolina, maize flour or mashed plantains may take the place of cassava flour. Fufu is often served with groundnut soup, palm nut soup, abunuabunu or light soup. The traditional method is to boil starchy food crops like cassava, yams or plantains and cocoyams and then pound them into a dough- like consistency. Fufu is eaten with the fingers, and a small ball of it can be dipped into an accompanying soup or sauce. ==African fufu== Portuguese traders introduced cassava to Africa from Brazil in the 16th century. In Ghana, fufu, also known as fufuo, is white and sticky (if plantain is not mixed with the cassava when pounding). The traditional method of eating fufu is to pinch some of the fufu off in one's right hand fingers and form it into an easily ingested round ball. The ball is then dipped in the soup before being eaten. In C√¥te d'Ivoire, the word ‚Äúfoutou‚Äù is also used. Ivorian ‚Äúfoufou‚Äù is specifically sweet mashed bananas, whereas the ‚Äúfoutou‚Äù is a stronger, heavier pasta made of various staple foods such as yam, cassava, banana, taro or a mix of any of those. In the French-speaking regions of Cameroon, it is called ‚Äúcouscous‚Äù (not to be confused with the North African dish couscous).DeLancey, Mark W., and Mark Dike DeLancey (2000). Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cameroon, 3rd ed. Lanham, Maryland: The Scarecrow Press, p. 134. A similar staple in the African Great Lakes region is ugali. It is usually made from maize flour (masa), and is also eaten in Southern Africa. The name ugali is used to refer to the dish in Kenya and Tanzania. Closely related staples are called nshima in Zambia, nsima in Malawi, sadza in Zimbabwe, pap or vuswa in South Africa, posho in Uganda, luku, fufu, nshima, moteke, semoule, ugali and bugari in the Republic of the Congo and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and phalet≈°he in Botswana. ==Caribbean fufu== In Caribbean nations with substantial populations of West African origin, such as Cuba, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Puerto Rico, plantains, yuca or yams are mashed with other ingredients (fuf√∫ nigeriano). In Cuba, the dish retains its original African stem name, termed simply as fuf√∫ or with added descriptive extensions like fuf√∫ de platano or fuf√∫ de platano pint√≥n. On other major islands, fuf√∫ goes by the names of mang√∫ in the Dominican Republic, mofongo and funche in Puerto Rico and bammy in Jamaica. What distinguishes the Caribbean \\"fuf√∫\\" from its West African relative is a firmer texture with stronger flavors. As it moves away from Cuba, the fuf√∫'s core is less a gelatinous dough and more of a consistent mass. Puerto Rican mofongo, in keeping with the creolized cuisine traditions of the Caribbean, tends toward a fuf√∫ of much higher density and robust seasoning. While keeping a conspicuous African character, mofongo has borrowed from the island's Iberian culinary tradition, to create a dish made of fried green plantains, yuca or breadfruit. Unlike the mushier Caribbean and West African fuf√∫s, mofongo is generally firmer and crustier. Nigerian food: fufu being sold on the street in Lagos To prepare mofongo, green plantains are deep-fried once unlike twice fried tostones. Next, they are mashed in a 'pilon' (mortar) with chopped garlic, salt, black pepper and olive oil. The resulting mash is then pressed and rounded into a hollowed crusty orb. Meat, traditionally chicharr√≥n, is then stuffed into the chunky ball of fried green plantains. A few recipes call for a meat or vegetable salsa criolla\\" (related to American Creole sauce) poured on top of the hot sphere. In the trendier \\"mofongo relleno,\\" typical of western Puerto Rico, seafood is all over, inside and outside. Traditional mofongo, as previously cited, comes seasoned and stuffed with meat and bathed in a chicken broth soup.Food and Identity in the Caribbean, Hanna Garth, Ed. 2013 Bloomsbury Press. Because of its elaborate process of preparation and its sundry ingredients, poet and blogger Arose N Daghetto called the mofongo a type of \\"fuf√∫ paella\\" and branded it as \\"the big daddy of fuf√∫s.\\" A dish called funche made with taro, green and yellow plantains boiled and mashed with butter, garlic, and pork fat was once popular in Puerto Rico. Once mashed it was formed into balls and eaten with broth made from sesame seeds. Funche is written in early Puerto Rican cookbooks around the 1800's, but can probably be traced back to African slaves on the island. Funche today in Puerto Rico is cornmeal cooked in coconut milk and milk. Wrapped fufu The vegetable or fuf√∫ sauce in the Anglo-Caribbean is not fried first. Plantain is not used as much, as it is used in so many dishes. Fufu is usually part of, or added to, a soupy sauce or on the side with a soupy dish. In Antigua, fufu is served as part of the national dish but is called fungi/fungee and is made using cornmeal and okra. Similarly, in Barbados it serves as part of the national dish and is called cou cou and uses cornmeal or, less commonly, breadfruit instead, like several other English Caribbean islands. In Haiti it is called tum tum and Foofoo. It is mostly made of breadfruit but can be made of plantain or yams and is usually served with an okra based stew or soup. ==Origin== Fufu is believed to originate in what is modern-day Ghana,Siciliano-Rosen, L. \\"Fufu.\\" Encyclopedia Britannica.https://www.britannica.com/topic/fufu by the Asante, the Akuapem, the Guans, the Akyem, the Bono and the Fante peoples of the Akan ethnic group of Ghana. Today, it also features in Beninese cuisine, Togolese cuisine, Guinean cuisine, Cameroonian cuisine, as well as Nigerian cuisine. Fufu‚Äôs prevalence in the West African subregion has been noted in literature produced by authors from that area. It is mentioned in Chinua Achebe‚Äôs Things Fall Apart, for example. ==Preparation== Pounded fufu In Ghana, pieces of boiled cassava or other tubers are pounded together in a giant wooden mortar using a wooden pestle. In between blows from the pestle, the mixture is turned by hand and water gradually added till it becomes slurry and sticky. The mixture is then formed into a ball or a rounded slab and served. With the invention of the fufu machine preparation has become much less labour-intensive.

It was said of Ewing that he was 'Careful at all times of his appearance, his suits were mostly grey, added to which he generally wore ‚Äì whatever the fashion ‚Äì a white piqu√© stripe to his waistcoat, a mauve shirt, a white butterfly collar and a dark blue bow tie with white spots.' He was regarded as brilliant and successful, but was conscious of his dignity and position. On appointment to head the newly created Admiralty codebreaking department, the Director of Naval Intelligence, Henry Oliver, described him as 'too distinguished a man to be placed officially under the orders of the Director of Intelligence or Chief of Staff'. His first wife, Annie, was an American, a great great niece of George Washington.Beesley p. 10 ==Life== ===Early life=== Born in Dundee, Scotland, Ewing was the third son of the Reverend James Ewing a minister of the Free Church of Scotland. He was educated at West End Academy and the High School of Dundee, Ewing showed an early interest in science and technology. Ewing won a scholarship to the University of Edinburgh where he studied physics under Peter Guthrie Tait before graduating in engineering. During his summer vacations, he worked on telegraph cable laying expeditions, including one to Brazil, under William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin and Fleeming Jenkin. ===Japan=== In 1878, on Fleeming Jenkin's recommendation, Ewing was recruited to help the modernisation of Meiji Era Japan as one of the o-yatoi gaikokujin (hired foreigners). Serving as professor of mechanical engineering at the Tokyo Imperial University, he was instrumental in founding Japanese seismology. Ewing made two special friends at Tokyo University soon after arriving: Basil Hall Chamberlain and Lieutenant Thomas Henry James R.N. who taught navigation. He was also in close contact with Henry Dyer and William Edward Ayrton at the Imperial College of Engineering (Kobu Dai Gakk≈ç). In Tokyo, Ewing taught courses on mechanics and on heat engines to engineering students, and on electricity and magnetism to students of physics. He carried out many research projects on magnetism and coined the word 'hysteresis'. His investigations into earthquakes led him to help T. Lomar Gray and John Milne of the Imperial College of Engineering to develop the first modern seismograph, from 1880‚Äì1895. All three men worked as a team on the invention and use of seismographs, though Milne is generally credited with the invention of the first modern horizontal-pendulum seismograph. Ewing joined Gray and Milne in founding the Seismological Society of Japan (SSJ) in 1880.Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Inventor, John Milne ===Return to Dundee=== In 1883, Ewing returned to his native Dundee to work at the recently established University College Dundee as its first Professor of Engineering. He was appalled by the living conditions he found in many of the poorer areas of the town which he felt compared unfavourably with those in Japan. He worked fervently with local government and industry to improve amenities, in particular sewer systems, and to lower the infant mortality rate. Some of the letters Ewing wrote at this time are now held by Archive Services, University of Dundee along with some of his other papers. A reminder of Ewing's connection with both University College and the city of Dundee is the University of Dundee's Ewing Building which was built in 1954 and named in his honour. The Ewing Building is currently used by the University's School of Engineering, Physics and Mathematics. ===University of Cambridge=== In 1890, Ewing took up the post of Professor of Mechanism and Applied Mechanics at the University of Cambridge, initially at Trinity College, though he later moved to King's College. At Cambridge, Ewing's research into the magnetisation of metals led him to criticise the conventional account of Wilhelm Weber. In 1890, he observed that magnetisation lagged behind an applied alternating current. He described the characteristic hysteresis curve and speculated that individual molecules act as magnets, resisting changes in magnetising potential. (Note: According to the book Sir Alfred Ewing: A Pioneer in Physics and Engineering (1946) by Professor Bates, the discovery of magnetic hysteresis probably occurred before Ewing. However, Ewing re-discovered it, studied it in detail and coined the word hysteresis). Ewing also researched into the crystalline structure of metals and, in 1903, was the first to propose that fatigue failures originated in microscopic defects or slip bands in materials. In 1895 he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Society for his work on Magnetic Induction in Iron and other Metals. Ewing was a close friend of Sir Charles Algernon Parsons and collaborated with him on the development of the steam turbine. During this time, Ewing published The Steam Engine and other Heat Engines around this time. In 1897 he took part in the sea-trials of the experimental vessel Turbinia, which set a new speed record of 35 knots. In 1898, Ewing took his wife and children to Switzerland for a mountaineering holiday with the family of noted Professor of Electrical Engineering at King's College, John Hopkinson. All five of the Hopkinson brothers were members of the Alpine Club and soon initiated Ewing into the sport of rock climbing. On 27 August, John Hopkinson set out with his son Jack and two of his three daughters to climb. Ewing decided not to go with them as he was feeling a little stiff after his climb the previous day. The party never returned, and was found the next morning, all four bodies roped together five hundred feet below the summit. In 1898 Ewing was elected to a Professorial Fellowship at King's College. ===Admiralty=== On 8 April 1903, The Times announced that the Board of Admiralty selected Ewing for the newly created post of Director of Naval Education (DNE) in Greenwich.The Times, Wednesday, 8 April 1903; The New Director of Naval Education. Category: Official Appointments and Notices. He married Anne Maria Thomasina Blackburn Washington on 14 May 1879 in Tokyo, Japan. She was a descendant of President George Washington's brother John Augustine Washington. Ewing's first wife, Annie (n√©e Washington) died in 1909 and, in 1912, he married Ellen, the surviving daughter of his old friend and patron, John Hopkinson. He had two children with his first wife: Maud Janet Wills, n√©e Ewing (20 May 1880 ‚Äì 27 April 1952) and Alfred Washington Ewing (1 November 1881 ‚Äì 5 December 1962). As reward for his services, Ewing was made Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1906 and then Knight Commander of the Bath in 1911.Beesley p.10 During World War I, from 1914 to May 1917, Ewing managed Room 40, the Admiralty intelligence department of cryptanalysis, responsible predominantly for the decryption of intercepted German naval messages. In this capacity, he achieved considerable fame in the popular press when Room 40 deciphered the Zimmermann Telegram in 1917 (which suggested a German plot to assist Mexico in recovering the southwestern United States). The publication of the Zimmermann Telegram is generally credited as the trigger event which brought American into the Great War. ===University of Edinburgh=== In May 1916 Ewing accepted an invitation to become Principal of the University of Edinburgh, in the course of which he instituted an extensive series of effective reforms and which he held until his retirement in 1929. In 1927 he gave a lecture to the Edinburgh Philosophical Institution which contained the first semi-official disclosure of the work done by Room 40. A house in Pollock Halls of Residence is named in his honour. Sir Alfred Ewing died in 1935 and is buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge, with his second wife Lady Ellen Ewing. ==Honours== *Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1878); *Fellow of the Royal Society (1887); *LL.D.

Suffering from poor eyesight accentuated by a childhood eye injury, he was poor at other sports, but excelled on the track from an early age. ==Professional career== Burrell was plagued by injuries and bad luck throughout his career, particularly around major championships. He won gold in the 100 m ahead of Carl Lewis at the 1990 Goodwill Games in Seattle. He won the silver in the 100 m behind Lewis at the 1991 World Championships. At the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Burrell false-started in the 100 m final. When the race finally restarted, his reaction off the line was slow, and he finished fifth. He did manage to win a relay gold as part of the U.S. 4 √ó 100 m team. On May 19, 1990, Burrell ran a wind-assisted 200 m at College Station, Texas, in a time of 19.61 seconds. The wind speed was +4.0 m per second. This was the fastest time for the 200 m for over six years until the 1996 Olympic final in Atlanta, where Michael Johnson ran 19.32 seconds. He first set the world record in June 1991 with a time of 9.90 seconds. This was broken that September by Carl Lewis who ran 9.86 sec at the 1991 World Track and Field Championships where Burrell finished second in a new personal best time of 9.88 sec. In July 1994, Burrell set the world record for the second time when he ran 9.85 sec (a record that stood until the 1996 Olympics when Donovan Bailey ran 9.84 sec). Since his retirement in 1998, Burrell has replaced his old college mentor, Tom Tellez, as coach of the University of Houston's track team. Burrell has led UH to 14 men's Conference USA titles (nine indoor, five outdoor) and nine women's titles (four indoor, five outdoor). He was inducted into the Texas Track and Field Coaches Hall of Fame in 2014. ==Personal life== Burrell married Michelle Finn, also a sprinter, in 1994, and they have three sons: Cameron, a sprinter for the Houston Cougars, Joshua, and Jaden. On June 7, 2017, Cameron joined his father in the sub-10 second club. Burrell's younger sister Dawn also competed in track and field at the highest level and she was a world indoor champion in the long jump. ==Statistics== Information from IAAF profile unless otherwise noted. ===World records=== Includes former all-conditions world best in the 200 meters.

It was part of the Birmingham Duddeston constituency until that ceased to exist in 1950. ==Etymology== The name Duddeston comes from Dud's Town, with Dud being the Saxon proprietor, Lord of Dudley who probably had a seat in Duddeston. It was speculated that Duddeston came from Dudda's tun but nothing is known of Dudda. ==History== Duddeston Barracks circa 1900 Duddeston is first mentioned in a charter granted to Wulfget the Thane by Eadgar, King of the Angles in 963. There is no mention of Duddeston for another 200 years until it said that the Holte family were the residents of Duddeston Manor, a large house located next to the River Rea. This had been purchased by the family in 1365 by the family who also owned the manor of Nechells and were related to a prominent family in Erdington. Their wealth of land expanded two years later when the manor of Aston was bestowed upon them. 100 years later, Thomas Holte became the Chief Justice of Wales and a close friend of King Henry VIII. In 1546, Thomas died and Duddeston Hall was a sign of his wealth. His grandson, also called Thomas Holte, supplied a small army in defending Ireland and for this he was knighted. He commissioned the construction of Aston Hall soon after. During the 18th century, many adverts for cock fighting at the hall appearedSport in the Olden Time (History of Cockfighting Series), Gilbey, Bart., Sir Walter, 2005, Read Country Books () and in many, the name Vauxhall appeared. The first use of the name Vauxhall was in 1751 and was spelt Vaux Hall. It was referred to as another name for the hall. It is also known that the building had been refurbished, possibly rebuilt, to accommodate travellers. Large gardens had also been created and it became an attraction for the city. Travelling there was made easier with the opening of Duddeston and Vauxhall railway station. However, the owners of the hall ran into financial difficulty and the last celebrations in the gardens were held in September 1850, before the gardens were removed. Houses were built on site. During the Priestly Riots of 1791, the military established Duddeston Barracks in the area. The barracks remained until 1932, when they were demolished by the Birmingham Corporation for the construction of maisonettes. After sustaining heavy damage during World War II bombing raids, as a result of its close proximity to targets such as factories and gas works, the area was named as one of five regeneration areas of the city with of land in Duddeston and the adjoining Nechells prepared for redevelopment under the Housing Act of 1936.New Towns for Old: The Technique of Urban Renewal, Wilfred Burns, 1963, L. Hill This was the first redevelopment area proposed by Herbert Manzoni and was approved in 1950. Most of the area was rebuilt in the 1950s and 1960s. This began with the construction of four tower blocks, which were the first tower blocks in the city.Bigger is Better? Local authority housing and the strange attraction of high-rise, 1945-70, Phil Jones - Urban Morphology Research Group, University of Birmingham, 2002 (Accessed 28 April 2007) Collectively known as the Duddeston Four, the 12-storey High, Queens, Home and South Towers, were all completed between 1954 and 1955 to a design by SN Cooke and Partners. They consist of a stretched X-shaped footprint and have brick cladding with porthole shaped windows. The design was expensive and upon their completion, they were criticised by the council over their cost, despite received positive reviews from the \\"Municipal Journal\\" and \\"Architectural Review\\". In the 1990s, they were refurbished and a new security system was installed, while other multi-storey blocks in the area were demolished and replaced by low-rise housing, continuing with the theme of low-rise housing in the area which began in the 1970s. ===Notable people=== *Samuel \\"John\\" Galton Jr. FRS, (1753‚Äì1832), was born in Duddeston. * William Amey VC MM, (1881‚Äì1940), recipient of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was born in Duddeston.

The genus is naturally distributed in tropical regions of India, Southeast Asia and New Guinea.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families The typical habitats of Cryptocoryne are mostly streams and rivers with not too rapidly flowing water, in the lowland forest. They also live in seasonally inundated forest pools or on river banks submerged only at high water. Although the proper scientific name of the genus is Cryptocoryne, they are commonly referred to as crypts. The English name \\"water trumpet\\" refers to their inflorescence, a spadix enclosed by a spathe (typical for the whole family), which resembles a trumpet. The first Cryptocoryne species was described in 1779 as Arum spirale by Retzius. The genus was described by Friedrich Ernst Ludwig von Fischer in 1828. However, the scientific classification of Cryptocoryne species is very complicated and there are different opinions about it. Lagenandra is another genus closely related to the genus Cryptocoryne. The two can be easily told apart since the leaves of Cryptocoryne species exhibit convolute vernation whereas Lagenandra species exhibit involute vernation. The name Cryptocoryne is derived from the Greek crypto, hidden, and koryne, meaning club. The common name (water trumpet) refers to the shape of its inflorescence, which is typical of the Araceae family. Image: Cryptocoryne Flower.JPGInflorescence of C. pontederiifolia Image: Cryptocoryne wendtii.JPGC. wendtii \\"Green\\", the most popular Cryptocoryne Image:-Cryptocoryne wendtii- from Tropica farm.JPGA form of C. wendtii produced by Tropica Aquarium Plants == Cultivation and uses == Some Cryptocoryne are popular commercially cultivated aquarium plants. Submerged plants reproduce vegetatively, emerse plants may flower and reproduce sexually. Many species are cultivated only by dedicated experts and are very hard to grow, or are not present in a culture at all. Some species are endangered because their natural habitats are disappearing. On the other hand, some water trumpets (e.g. Cryptocoryne beckettii) are very hardy aquarium plants, easy to grow to the point that they have become an invasive species after being introduced in Florida in North America. Cryptocoryne is either found in peat bogs or on limestone; the latter do well in most aquaria, the former must have soft water to survive and need decomposing beech leaf litter to do well. C. striolata, while found primarily in peat bogs, has also been found growing on limestone. Borneo is home to many endemic crypts previously thought to grow only in tea-colored soft acid water emulating peat bogs but exploration of habitats from 2005 to 2010 showed about half grew on limestone as well. These hardwater Cryptocorynes are generally the easier ones to keep (in fact, some species, such as Cryptocoryne wendtii are said to be among the most versatile of aquarium plants); they tolerate low or bright light but grow faster in more intense light. This water plant's range is around 12 to 33 ¬∞C, and slightly alkaline to neutral pH. Plants of the genus Cryptocoryne, which range from India to New Guinea are found in very diverse conditions. Some are true acid loving plants such as C. pallidnerva, found in peat bogs in Borneo, while others such as C. crispatula var. balansae and C. pontiderifolia are found in streams with limestone beds‚Äîhard alkaline water. One species, C. ciliata is even found in semi-brackish water in some areas. It is one of the few aquarium plants that tolerates salt concentrations. Cryptocoryne plants have been in cultivation in the aquarium hobby since the late 18th century, although it was not until the 1960s that more than a handful of species was known and became more common in the hobby. New species still regularly crop up as interest in these plants widens and more collecting expeditions by private parties are carried out. == Crypt melt == A phenomenon often encountered when planting new crypts in an aquarium is commonly called Crypt melt, whereby the plant loses all its leaves.Cryptocoryne affinis leaf drop There seem to be two possible causes for this. Rapid environmental changes is thought to trigger this, as these plants do not seem to adapt well to transplantion, and may need 30 days or so to become established and for the leaves to regrow. Experienced growers report that it is better to plant crypts in aquariums that have been established for at least three months. In the wild, crypts can grow fully submerged underwater, but in some plant nurseries they are often grown emersed and crypt melt could then be triggered by the change from emerse to submerse conditions. There is lately a trend for such nurseries to send crypts as just a rootstock (i.e. without the leaves) to reduce shipping costs and because the leaves will be lost anyway once planted in an aquarium. Other reports emphasise the need to change the aquarium water regularly to prevent the buildup of nitrates which are thought to trigger this condition (often referred to as a disease). == Species == # Cryptocoryne affinis N.E.Br. in J.D.Hooker \\\\- Thailand, Malaysia # Cryptocoryne alba de Wit \\\\- Sri Lanka # Cryptocoryne albida R.Parker \\\\- southern China, eastern India, Bangladesh, Indochina # Cryptocoryne annamica Serebryanyi \\\\- Vietnam # Cryptocoryne aponogetifolia Merr. \\\\- Philippines # Cryptocoryne aura - West kalimantan # Cryptocoryne auriculata Engl. \\\\- Sarawak, Philippines # Cryptocoryne bangkaensis Bastm. \\\\- Sumatra # Cryptocoryne beckettii Thuill. ex Trim. \\\\- Sri Lanka; naturalized in Texas # Cryptocoryne bogneri Rataj \\\\- Sri Lanka # Cryptocoryne bullosa Becc. \\\\- Sarawak # Cryptocoryne ciliata (Roxb.)

His father was clerk of the revolutionary conventions during the next two years. Although his mother died when he was a child, his maternal grandfather, lawyer Benjamin Waller, taught him Latin.Virginia and Virginians, R. A. Brock, University of Virginia Library Tazewell was privately tutored by John Wickham; he later graduated from the College of William and Mary at Williamsburg in 1791. He married Ann Stratton Nivison Tazewell (1785-1858) and they had at least six daughters as well as two sons, although only four daughters would survive their mother. ==Career== After studying law, Tazewell was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1796, and commenced practice in James City County, Virginia. He was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates (a part-time position) representing James City County from 1798 to 1800, when he resigned to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of John Marshall in the Sixth United States Congress, serving in the federal legislature from November 26, 1800, to March 4, 1801.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) pp. 212, 216, 220, 57, 261, 266 Politically, Tazewell was a Jeffersonian Republican, and upon the fissure of that party he associated with the Jacksonian Democrats. Tazewell moved to Norfolk, Virginia in 1802. He represented Norfolk Borough in the General Assemblies of 1804-1805 and 1805-1806, but was replaced by William Newsum, Jr. in the Assembly of 1806-1806.Leonard p. 236, 241 Nonetheless, on July 5, 1807, he defused the impressment crisis involving the British HMS Leopard in Norfolk harbor and the USS Chesapeake and Norfolk mayor Richard E. Lee.Thomas C. Parramore et al, Norfolk:The First Four Centuries (University of Virginia Press 1994) pp. 135-136 Tazewell again represented James City County in the House of Delegates from 1809 until 1812.Leonard, pp. 257, 261, 266 Then Norfolk voters elected him to represent the Borough again in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1816 to 1817. After the War of 1812, Tazewell, General Taylor, George Newton and others also formed the Roanoke Commercial Company, designed to expand traffic through the Dismal Swamp Canal and allow goods from as far away as mountainous Bedford County to ship through Norfolk.Parramore p. 148 Tazewell also served as one of the commissioners of claims under the treaty with Spain which ceded Florida in 1821. Virginia legislators elected Tazewell in 1824 to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of John Taylor. Re-elected in 1829, he served from December 7, 1824, to July 16, 1832, when he resigned to become Virginia's governor, as discussed below. While in the Senate, Tazewell was President pro tempore of the Senate during the Twenty-second United States Congress and chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. His principal published work is Review of the Negotiations between the United States and Great Britain Respecting the Commerce of the Two Countries (1829).New International Encyclopedia Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Littleton Waller Tazewell, 1825.

When the Whigs secured majorities in the Virginia Assembly for six years, they first elected the Old Republican as a Whig governor 1834‚Äì36, although he resigned a year before his term ended.Salmon, Emily J. and Edward D.C. Campbell, Jr., \\"The Hornbook of Virginia History\\", , 1994, p.109 During his two years as governor, Tazewell had to address abolitionism, although Nat Turner's revolt had occurred in 1831 while Tazewell was home from Washington (and caused him to neglect his plantations). He became an advocate of wholesale colonization, and as Governor asked Virginia's legislature to formally request that Northern states suppress abolitionist groups and also asked Congress to suppress delivery of such literature through the U.S. Post Office.Parramore p. 165 Tazewell's governorship was also marked by expansion of the James River Canal, which was to connect to the Kanawha Canal and thus the Ohio River. Under his leadership, the Assembly instructed Virginia's U.S. Senators to support internal improvements, protective tariffs, and a national bank in support of Henry Clay's American System.Dabney, Virginius. \\"Virginia: the New Dominion\\", , 1971 p. 219 Following his term as Governor, Tazewell retired from public life, but nevertheless received 11 electoral votes for Vice-President in the election of 1840. Tazewell owned plantations and enslaved persons in the Hampton Roads area. In the 1830 U.S. Federal Census, his Norfolk household included nine free white people (5 his children) and a dozen slaves.1830 U.S. Federal Census for Norfolk, Virginia Although Virginia state slave censuses are not available online, and several federal census returns appear either missing or digitally misindexed, by 1860, his household included nine slaves (3 men, 5 women and one 2 year old boy) in Norfolk, and over 100 slaves across the Chesapeake Bay in Northampton County, Virginia (inherited through his wife).1860 U.S. Federal Census, Slave schedules, for Norfolk, Virginia and Northampton, VirginiaRalph T. Whitelaw, Virginia's Eastern Shore: A stoudy of Northampton and Accomack Counties (Virginia Historical Society 1951) vol. 1 pp. 144, 147 ==Death and legacy== Governor Tazewell died a widower in Norfolk, Virginia, on May 6, 1860. Initially interred with his wife on his estate on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, he was re-interred in 1866 at Elmwood Cemetery in Norfolk. Tazewell, Virginia, Tazewell County, Virginia and Tazewell County, Illinois are named in his honor, and in his father's honor, as are the cities of Tazewell and New Tazewell, Tennessee. A plaque remembering him stands at the corner of Tazewell and Granby streets in Norfolk, near the Tazewell Hotel and Suites, where his two-story house was located. His house, known as the Boush-Tazewell House, was completely dismantled and re-erected in its present location about three miles from its original site around 1902. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Tazewell was the maternal grandfather of Littleton Waller Tazewell Bradford (1848‚Äì1918), a prominent Virginia politician, and a founder of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. A building at the College of William and Mary is named in Tazewell's honor. ==References== ==External links== * Congressional biography * Discourse on the Life and Character of the Hon.

It is caused when either the front or rear wheel slides out as a result of either too much braking into the corner, too much acceleration through or out of the corner, or too much speed carried into or through the corner for the available grip. It may also be caused by unexpected slippery or loose material (such as oil, water, dirt or gravel) on the road surface. In the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Australia it is referred to as a \\"lowside\\" rather than a \\"lowsider\\". ==Causes of lowsider crashes== All horizontal forces occurring between the motorcycle and the road (such as accelerating, decelerating and steering) are transmitted by friction in the contact patches. There is a limited amount of force each contact patch can transmit before the tire begins to slide. Typically, the maximum force once sliding is slightly less than before sliding.\\"Tire and Vehicle Dynamics\\", Hans B Pacejka When travelling in a curve, the tires provide the centripetal force needed for the acceleration towards the center of the curve. The capsizing moment provided by gravity acting on the motorcycle center of mass when leaning into a corner is balanced by a righting moment generated by centripetal forces in the contact patches when all is working correctly. If, having reached a given lean angle, the centripetal forces are reduced then the motorcycle increases its angle of lean until it touches the road surface, usually unseating the rider in the process. Lowsiders are caused by exceeding the lateral friction limit or by exceeding the combined lateral/longitudinal friction limit in one or more of the following ways: * Braking force plus turning force exceeds friction available on either tire * Turning forces exceed friction available on either tire * Acceleration force exceeds friction on the rear tire * Bodywork or peg hitting a road surface lifts the bike causing less friction on either wheel * Rapid deflation of one of the tires causes grip levels to reduce Lowsider crashes are not usually caused by braking in a straight line in dry conditions. It is more likely that the rider will go over the handlebars through too much front wheel brake force or will lock the rear wheel resulting in a straight skid. The name derives from the fact that it is the low side of the motorcycle that hits the ground. ==Injury risks== Riders are usually advised to do a lowsider rather than a highsider if neither can be avoided. The lowsider has the advantage of the motorcycle sliding before the rider, thus not threatening to crush him or her. Also, a lowsider tends to send the rider sliding across the road whereas a highsider is considered more severe as it violently throws the rider from the motorcycle with a higher probability of broken bones. The main injury risks are: * Gravel rash due to sliding across the road surface at speed * Hitting traffic coming in the opposing lane * Impact injuries on the side the rider goes down (usually an elbow, shoulder or hip contusion, but the bike landing on an ankle can cause injuries, too) * Hitting static objects on the side of the road such as street furniture or signage == See also == * Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics * Motorcycle safety == References == Category:Motorcycle dynamics Category:Road accidents and incidents ","title":"Lowsider"},{"id":"844666","text":"Kitts Green is an area of Birmingham, England, approximately 5 miles east of the city centre and on the borders of Lea Village, Lea Hall, and Garrets Green.

They are typically in the middle of the eyelid, red, and not painful. They tend to come on gradually over a few weeks. A chalazion may occur following a stye or from hardened oils blocking the gland. The blocked gland is usually the meibomian gland but can also be the gland of Zeis. A stye and cellulitis may appear similar. A stye, however, is usually more sudden in onset, painful, and occurs at the edge of the eyelid. Cellulitis is also typically painful. Treatment is initiated with warm compresses. If this is not effective injecting corticosteroids into the lesion may be tried. If large, incision and drainage may be recommended. While relatively common the frequency of the condition is unknown. The term is from the Greek () meaning \\"small hailstone\\". ==Signs and symptoms== Eyelid affected by a large chalazion * Painless swelling on the eyelid * Eyelid tenderness typically none to mild * Increased tearing * Heaviness of the eyelid * Redness of conjunctiva ===Complications=== A large chalazion can cause astigmatism due to pressure on the cornea. As laser eye surgery involves shaping the cornea by burning parts of it away, weakening its structure, post-operation, people can be left predisposed to deformation of the cornea from small chalazia. Complications of corticosteroid injection include hypopigmentation, and fat atrophy which is less likely to occur in conjunctival approach of injection. A chalazion that reoccurs in the same area may rarely be a symptom of sebaceous cell carcinoma. ==Diagnosis== Classic lipogranulomatous response seen in a well-developed chalazion A chalazion or meibomian cyst can sometimes be mistaken for a stye. ===Differential diagnosis=== * Sebaceous gland adenoma * Sebaceous gland carcinoma * Sarcoid granuloma * Foreign body granuloma ==Treatment== Topical antibiotic eye drops or ointment (e.g., chloramphenicol or fusidic acid) are sometimes used for the initial acute infection, but are otherwise of little value in treating a chalazion. Chalazia will often disappear without further treatment within a few months, and virtually all will resorb within two years. Healing can be facilitated by applying a warm compress to the affected eye for approximately 15 minutes 4 times per day. This promotes drainage and healing by softening the hardened oil that is occluding the duct. If they continue to enlarge or fail to settle within a few months, smaller lesions may be injected with a corticosteroid, or larger ones may be surgically removed using local anesthesia. ‚Äî in which of those cases attending a District General Hospital, approximately one third of selected chalazia resolved within 3 months with conservative treatment, and surgical treatment was successful for 72%. This is usually done from underneath the eyelid to avoid a scar on the skin. If the chalazion is located directly under the eyelid's outer tissue, however, an excision from above may be more advisable so as not to inflict any unnecessary damage on the lid itself. Eyelid epidermis usually mends well, without leaving any visible scar.Gerstenkorn/Hagelkorn Depending on the chalazion's texture, the excision procedure varies: while fluid matter can easily be removed under minimal invasion, by merely puncturing the chalazion and exerting pressure upon the surrounding tissue, hardened matter usually necessitates a larger incision, through which it can be scraped out. Any residual matter should be metabolized in the course of the subsequent healing process, generally aided by regular appliance of dry heat. The excision of larger chalazia may result in visible hematoma around the lid, which will wear off within three or four days, whereas the swelling may persist for longer. Chalazion excision is an ambulant treatment and normally does not take longer than fifteen minutes. Nevertheless, owing to the risks of infection and severe damage to the eyelid, such procedures should only be performed by a medical professional. Chalazia may recur, and they will usually be biopsied to rule out the possibility of a tumour. ===Surgery=== A large chalazion ca. 20 minutes upon excision. This bipartite chalazion was removed via two separate incisions. Further along the lower eyelid, signs of chronic inflammation (Blepharitis) are visible. Chalazion surgery is a simple procedure that is generally performed as a day operation, and the person does not need to remain in the hospital for further medical care. Sometimes, as a last resort, surgery is performed. The eyelid is injected with a local anesthetic, a clamp is put on the eyelid, then the eyelid is turned over, an incision is made on the inside of the eyelid, and the chalazion is drained and scraped out with a curette. A scar on the upper lid can cause discomfort as some people feel the scar as they blink. As surgeries damage healthy tissue (e.g., leaving behind scar tissue or possibly even causing blepharitis), given other options, less intrusive treatment are preferable. Blocked meibomian glands may also be treatable with hot towels, which soften the oils in the gland. Chalazion removal surgery is performed under local or general anesthesia. Commonly, general anesthesia is administered in children to make sure they stay still and no injury to the eye occurs. Local anesthesia is used in adults and it is applied with a small injection into the eyelid. The discomfort of the injection is minimized with the help of an anesthetic cream, which is applied locally. The chalazion may be removed in two ways, depending on the size of cyst. Relatively small chalazia are removed through a small cut at the back of the eyelid. The surgeon lifts the eyelid to access the back of its surface and makes an incision of approximately 3mm just on top of the chalazion. The lump is then removed, and pressure is applied for a few minutes to stop any oozing of blood that may occur because of the operation. Surgery of small chalazia does not require stitches, as the cut is at the back of the eyelid and therefore the cut cannot be seen, and the cosmetic result is excellent. Larger chalazia are removed through an incision in front of the eyelid. Larger chalazia usually push on the skin of the eyelid, and this is the main reason why doctors prefer removing them this way. The incision is not usually larger than 3mm and it is made on top of the chalazion. The lump is removed and then pressure is applied on the incision to prevent oozing. This type of surgery is closed with very fine stitches. They are hardly visible and are usually removed within a week after the surgery has been performed. Although chalazia are rarely dangerous, it is common to send the chalazion or part of it to a laboratory to screen for cancer. When surgery for a chalazion is considered, people who take aspirin or any other blood-thinning medications are advised to stop taking them one week prior to the procedure as they may lead to uncontrollable bleeding. There are several tests taken prior to surgery to make sure the person is in good condition for the operation. In rare cases, people are kept overnight in the hospital after chalazion surgery. This includes cases in which complications occurred and the person needs to be closely monitored. In most cases however, people are able to go home after the operation has ended. The recovery process is easy and quite fast. Most people with chalazion experience some very minor discomfort in the eye, which can be easily controlled by taking painkilling medication. People are, however, recommended to avoid getting water in the eye for up to 10 days after surgery. They may wash, bathe, or shower, but they must be careful to keep the area dry and clean. Makeup may be worn after at least one month post-operatively. People are recommended to not wear contact lenses in the affected eye for at least eight weeks to prevent infections and potential complications. Commonly, people receive eye drops to prevent infection and swelling in the eye and pain medication to help them cope with the pain and discomfort in the eyelid and eye. One can use paracetamol (acetominophen) rather than aspirin to control the pain. Also, after surgery, a pad and protective plastic shield are used to apply pressure on the eye in order to prevent leakage of blood after the operation; this may be removed 6 to 8 hours after the procedure. People who undergo chalazion surgery are normally asked to visit their eye surgeon for post-op follow-up three to four weeks after surgery has been performed. They may start driving the day after surgery and they may return to work in one or two days. Chalazion surgery is a safe procedure and complications occur very seldomly. Serious complications that require another operation are also very rare. Among potential complications, there is infection, bleeding, or the recurrence of the chalazion. ===Steroid injection=== Because the inflammatory cells of chalazia are sensitive to steroids, intralesional or subcutaneous injection of steroids, commonly triamcinolone acetonide (TA) is considered a simple and effective treatment option with high success rates. It may give the same results as surgical treatment (I&C;). Considering the surgical risks, steroid injection is believed as a safer procedure in marginal lesions and lesions close to lacrimal punctum. One injection alone has a success rate about 80%, if requested a second injection can be given 1-2 weeks later. ===Carbon dioxide laser=== Chalazion excision using CO2 laser is also a safer procedure with minimal bleeding. Eye patching also not required. ==See also== * Stye == References == == External links == Category:Disorders of eyelid, lacrimal system and orbit Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate Category:RTTNEURO ","title":"Chalazion"},{"id":"844674","text":"The University of Antwerp () is one of the major Belgian universities located in the city of Antwerp. The official abbreviation is UA, but UAntwerpen is more recently used. The University of Antwerp has about 20,000 students, which makes it the third largest university in Flanders. The University of Antwerp is characterised by its high standards in education, internationally competitive research and entrepreneurial approach. It was founded in 2003 after the merger of three smaller universities. As of 2019, the University of Antwerp ranks as 198th globally according to Times Higher Education, 223rd according to QS World University Rankings and between the 201 and 300th place according to the Academic Ranking of World Universities. The university ranked 22nd in the Times Higher Education Ranking for Young Universities (2019) and 18th in the QS University Ranking Top 50 Under 50 (2020). In ten domains the university's research is among the best in the world: Drug Discovery and Development; Ecology and Sustainable Development; Harbour, Transport and Logistics; Imaging; Infectious Diseases; Materials Characterisation; Neurosciences; Socio-economic Policy and Organisation; Public Policy and Political Science; Urban History and Contemporary Urban Policy. In September 2020, the University of Antwerp has chosen to begin the new academic year with stricter coronavirus measures than the ones recommended by the government. It's the first time in the university history that to move all classes online. ==History== ===Origins=== The university's roots go back to Sint-Ignatius Handelshogeschool (Saint-Ignatius School for Higher Education in Commerce) founded by the Jesuit (Society of Jesus) in Antwerp in 1852. This was one of the first European business schools to offer formal university degrees. It later opened a Faculty of Literature and Philosophy (including Law) and a Faculty of Political and Social Sciences. It was renamed Universitaire Faculteiten Sint-Ignatius Antwerpen (UFSIA) in the 1960s when the Belgian government granted it university status. In the early 1970s UFSIA joined into a confederation with \\"Rijksuniversitair Centrum Antwerpen\\" (RUCA) and \\"Universitaire Instelling Antwerpen\\" (UIA), public institutions. ===Merger=== In 2003 UFSIA, RUCA, and UIA merged into the University of Antwerp to become the first explicitly pluralistic university in Belgium, offering philosophical, ethical, and spiritual discourse and openness towards religion and intercultural dialogue. It soon became the third largest university in Flanders with 20,000 students. In order to face the challenges posed by the internationalization of European education and research, the University is part of the Antwerp University Association (AUHA). The Catholic influence that the Jesuits had at UFSIA continues through the Saint Ignatius University Centre (UCSIA), Antwerp, founded in 2003. ==Faculties== The University of Antwerp has 33 academic bachelor programmes, 69 master programmes, 18 master- after-master programmes and 23 postgraduates.

The band has won nine Grammy Awards since their 1970 inception, released over twenty albums, and has charted more than 21 singles on the Billboard country charts. Their highest- charting single, \\"The Letter That Johnny Walker Read\\", peaked at No. 10 in 1975. ==History== ===Beginnings to Austin=== In 1969, Ray Benson and Lucky Oceans (Reuben Gosfield) co-founded Asleep at the Wheel in Paw Paw, West Virginia, and soon after they found themselves opening for Alice Cooper and Hot Tuna in Washington, DC. A year later, they moved to East Oakland, California, at the invitation of Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen. After being mentioned in Rolling Stone magazine by Van Morrison, they landed a record deal with United Artists. In 1973, their debut album, Comin' Right at Ya, was released by United Artists. At the invitation of Willie Nelson, they left Oakland for Austin in 1974. ===1974 ‚Äì 1979=== In 1974, Asleep at the Wheel released its self-titled second album, with a cover of Louis Jordan's \\"Choo Choo Ch'Boogie\\", which was the band's first single to hit the country charts. The following year had the release of Texas Gold, with the top-ten Country hit single \\"The Letter That Johnny Walker Read\\". In addition, they played on PBS's Austin City Limits, where they have since performed a record- setting 10 times. In 1977, the band was voted Best Country Western Band by Rolling Stone and was awarded the Touring Band of the Year by the Academy of Country Music. They also went on tour with Emmylou Harris in Europe. The following year, they recorded a cover of Count Basie's song \\"One O'Clock Jump\\". Also in 1980, they appeared in the movie Roadie, along with Meat Loaf, Blondie, and Art Carney. By the end of the decade, the band recorded their first live album, Served Live, at the Austin Opera House. ===1980 ‚Äì 1989=== The 1980s became a turbulent decade for the band. After moving to MCA, co- founder Lucky Oceans left, followed in September 1986 by Chris O'Connell due to her pregnancy. Asleep at the Wheel gathered a large amount of debt that required it to work on commercials and movie soundtracks. This band produced the soundtrack for the film Liar's Moon. In 1985, the band released a virtually ignored self-titled album. By the late 1980s, Ray Benson had done some producing, allowing the band a second chance with Epic Records. In 1987, the band released 10, which won them their second Grammy for Best Country Instrumental, helping to launch their comeback. The album also had contributions from legendary fiddle player and onetime Texas Playboys member Johnny Gimble. The following year, the band released Western Standard Time, which won them another Grammy for Best Country Instrumental. The late 1980s also had the growth of Jann Browne as a solo vocalist in the group; she would later embark on a solo career on Curb Records. ===1990 ‚Äì 1999=== The band moved to Arista Records and released the album, Keepin' Me Up Nights. Soon after, the band had turnover. Among its new members was former solo singer Rosie Flores, who joined in 1997. In 1991, Ray Benson directed the music and co-starred in the movie Wild Texas Wind with Dolly Parton. In honor of the 66th anniversary of Route 66, the band launched the Route 66 Tour. In 1993, the band released an instant hit with several guest musicians, A Tribute to the Music of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys, to much critical acclaim. Two years later, the band celebrated their 25th anniversary by releasing The Wheel Keeps on Rollin. In 1999, the band and DreamWorks released Ride with Bob, as their second tribute album to Bob Wills. This album also enjoyed immediate success and garnered the band two Grammy wins, one for Best Country Instrumental, and the other for Best Package Design. According to Rolling Stone magazine, Ray Benson \\"didn't just enlist the obvious Wills fans\\" in this tribute album to Bob Wills like Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, and Lyle Lovett. He also brought in some of country's young lions the Dixie Chicks, Tim McGraw, and Lee Ann Womack, some pop stars\\", including Shawn Colvin, the Squirrel Nut Zippers, and fellow country preservationists such as Dwight Yoakam. ===2000 and onward=== In 2000, the Dixie Chicks were nominated for an award for Vocal Event of the Year for \\"Roly Poly\\" with Asleep at the Wheel from the Country Music Association. That same year, the band toured with Bob Dylan and George Strait. Benson recorded a tribute to Wills and Texas swing music, including Dwight Yoakam, Vince Gill, Merle Haggard, the Dixie Chicks, and Willie Nelson. They were scheduled to play at the White House on the fateful September 11, 2001. In 2003, the band released Live at Billy Bob's Texas, and by the end of the decade, the band had released two more albums: Reinventing the Wheel, an entirely new set of songs, including a collaboration with The Blind Boys of Alabama, and a two-disc set Kings of Texas Swing. In 2007, their second Christmas album was released, Santa Loves to Boogie. Asleep at the Wheel received six Austin Music Awards for their efforts in 2007, including Band of the Year, Songwriter of the Year (Benson), Country Band of the Year, Record Producer of the Year (Benson), Male Vocals of the Year (Benson), and Acoustic Guitar Player of the Year (McQueen). On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Asleep at the Wheel among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. ==Members== Current members *Ray Benson ‚Äì lead vocals, lead guitar *David Sanger ‚Äì drums, percussion *Katie Shore ‚Äì co-lead vocals, fiddle *Dennis Ludiker ‚Äì fiddle, mandolin, backing vocals *Connor Forsyth ‚Äì piano, organ, accordion, backing vocals *Josh Hoag ‚Äì bass *Flavio Pasquetto ‚Äì steel guitars ==Discography== ==References== ==External links== *Asleep at the Wheel official website *A Ride With Bob *Ray Benson Site *Floyd Domino Site Category:American country music groups Category:Grammy Award winners Category:Musical groups established in 1970 Category:Swing revival ensembles Category:Western swing musical groups Category:Musical groups from West Virginia Category:Musical groups from Austin, Texas Category:1970 establishments in Texas Category:Stony Plain Records artists Category:Epic Records artists Category:DreamWorks Records artists Category:Proper Records artists Category:MCA Records artists ","title":"Asleep at the Wheel"},{"id":"844677","text":"Arrhenatherum, commonly called oatgrass or button-grass, is a genus of Eurasian and North African plants in grass family.Palisot de Beauvois, Ambroise Marie Fran√ßois Joseph. 1812.

He represented Virginia in both houses of Congress and served as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Woodrow Wilson. He played a major role in the establishment of the U.S. financial regulatory system, helping to establish the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. After working as a newspaper editor and publisher, Glass won election to the Senate of Virginia in 1899. He was a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1902, where he was an influential advocate for segregationist policies. Historian J. Douglas Smith described him as ‚Äúthe architect of disenfranchisement in the Old Dominion.‚Äù He also promoted progressive fiscal and regulatory reform. Glass won election to the United States House of Representatives in 1902 and became Chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Currency in 1913. Working with President Wilson, he passed the Federal Reserve Act, which established a central banking system for the United States. Glass served as Secretary of the Treasury from 1918 until 1920, when he accepted an appointment to represent Virginia in the United States Senate. Glass was a favorite son candidate for the presidential nomination at the 1920 Democratic National Convention. Glass served in the Senate from 1920 until his death in 1946, becoming Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee in 1933. He also served as president pro tempore of the Senate from 1941 to 1945. He co-sponsored the 1933 Banking Act, also known as the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act, which created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and enforced the separation of investment banking firms and commercial banks. An ardent supporter of states' rights, Glass opposed much of the New Deal and clashed with President Franklin D. Roosevelt over the control of federal appointments in Virginia. ==Youth and education== Carter Glass was born on January 4, 1858, in Lynchburg, Virginia, the last child born to Robert Henry Glass and his first wife, the former Augusta Elizabeth Christian. His mother died on January 15, 1860, when Carter was only two years old, so his sister Nannie, ten years older (and Elizabeth's only daughter), became his surrogate mother. Carter, a slight boy, got his nickname, \\"Pluck\\", for his pugnacious willingness to stand up to bullies.James E. Palmer, Carter Glass: Unreconstructed Rebel (Roanoke: Institute of American Biography, 1938), pp. 15‚Äì20. His father, Robert Henry Glass, was Lynchburg's postmaster beginning in 1853, and in 1858 bought the Lynchburg Daily Republican newspaper (where he had worked since 1846). The city's other newspaper was the Lynchburg Daily Virginian, then published by Joseph Button, who on June 23, 1860, (while R. H. Glass was out of town) died in a duel with Glass's editor at the time, George W. Hardwicke, over accusations that Glass used his postal office to disadvantage the rival paper.Palmer, pp. 14‚Äì15. When the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865) broke out, Lynchburg was pro-Union but also pro-slavery, since its economy depended on the manufacture of tobacco as well as slave-trading and the new railroads. R. H. Glass volunteered and joined the Virginia forces in 1861, and then joined the Confederate Army, where he became a major on the staff of Brigadier General John B. Floyd, a former Governor of Virginia. Major Glass ultimately remarried and had seven more children, including Meta Glass (president of Sweet Briar College) and Edward Christian Glass (Lynchburg's school superintendent for five decades). In poverty-stricken Virginia during the post-War period, Glass received only a basic education at a private school run by one-legged former Confederate Henry L. Daviess.Palmer, p. 20. However, his father kept an extensive library. He became an apprentice printer to his father (and Hardwicke) when he was 13 years old, and continued his education through reading Plato, Edmund Burke and William Shakespeare, among others who stimulated his lifelong intellectual interest. In 1876, Major Glass accepted an offer to edit the Petersburg News, and Carter joined him as a journeyman printer. Not long afterward, Major Glass accepted the editorship of the Danville Post, but Carter did not join him, instead returning to Lynchburg.Palmer, pp. 22‚Äì24. ==Early career== When Glass was 19 years old, he moved with his father to Petersburg. However, when young Glass could not find a job as a newspaper reporter in Petersburg, he returned to Lynchburg, and went to work for former Confederate General (and future U.S. Senator) William Mahone's Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad (AM&O;), which was in receivership from 1877 to 1880. Glass was a clerk in the auditor's office at the railroad's headquarters. Several years later, under new owners and with headquarters relocated to Roanoke, the railroad became the Norfolk and Western (N&W;). However, by then Glass had found the newspaper job he had initially wanted. His formative years as Virginia struggled to resolve a large pre-War debt (Mahone being a leading figure in the Readjuster Party) and dealing with boom-and-bust economic cycles (some linked with stock speculation), helped mold Glass' conservative fiscal thinking, much as it did many other Virginia political leaders of his era. Photographic portrait of Carter Glass as a young man At the age of 22, Glass finally became a reporter, a job he had long sought, for the Lynchburg News. He rose to become the morning newspaper's editor by 1887. The following year, the publisher retired and offered Glass an option to purchase the business. Desperate to find financial backing, Glass received the unexpected assistance from a relative who loaned him enough for a $100 down payment on the $13,000 deal.Current Biography 1941, pp. 321‚Äì23. Free to write and publish whatever he wished, Glass wrote bold editorials and encouraged tougher reporting in the morning paper, which increased sales. Soon, Glass was able to acquire the afternoon Daily Advance, then to buy out the competing Daily Republican. Thus he became Lynchburg's sole newspaper publisher; the modern-day Lynchburg News and Advance is the successor publication to his newspapers. ==Entry into politics== As a prominent and respected newspaper editor, Glass often supported candidates who ran against Virginia's Democrats of the post-Reconstruction period, who he felt were promoting bad fiscal policy. In 1896, the same year his father died, Glass attended the Democratic National Convention as a delegate, and heard William Jennings Bryan speak. Glass was elected to the Senate of Virginia in 1899, and was a delegate to the Virginia constitutional convention of 1901‚Äì1902. He was one of the most influential members of the convention, which instituted measures associated with the Progressive movement, such as the establishment of the State Corporation Commission to regulate railroads and other corporations, replacing the former Virginia Board of Public Works. The 1902 Constitution instituted a poll tax and required bulk payment after a voter missed elections, making voting a luxury. The Constitution also required that voters pass a literacy test with their performance graded by the registrar. When questioned as to whether these measures were potentially discriminatory, Glass exclaimed, \\"Discrimination! Why that is exactly what we propose. To remove every negro voter who can be gotten rid of, legally, without materially impairing the numerical strength of the white electorate.\\"Damon W. Root, When bigots become reformers: the Progressive Era's shameful record on race, May 2006. Indeed, the number of African-Americans qualified to vote dropped from 147,000 to 21,000 immediately. Carter Glass remained one of the strongest advocates of segregation and continued to dedicate much of his political career to the perpetuation of Jim Crow laws in the South. ==Congress, Secretary of the Treasury== Glass's former residence, in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Glass was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1902, to fill a vacancy. In 1913, he became Chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Currency, where he worked with President Woodrow Wilson to pass the Glass-Owen Federal Reserve Act. In 1918, Wilson appointed him Secretary of the Treasury, succeeding William Gibbs McAdoo. His signature as Secretary of the Treasury can be found on series 1914 Federal Reserve Notes, issued while he was in office. At the 1920 Democratic National Convention Glass was nominated for President as a favorite son candidate from Virginia. Glass served at the Treasury until 1920, when he was appointed to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Virginia's senior senator, Thomas Staples Martin. Martin had been widely regarded as the head of Virginia's Democratic Party, a role filled during the 1920s by Harry Flood Byrd of Winchester, another Virginia newspaperman who shared many of Glass's political views and who headed the political machine of Conservative Democrats known as the Byrd Organization, which dominated Virginia's politics until the 1960s. In 1933, Byrd became Virginia's junior Senator, joining Glass in the Senate after former Governor and then-senior U.S. Senator Claude A. Swanson was appointed as U.S. Secretary of the Navy by President Franklin Roosevelt. Both Glass and Byrd were opposed to Roosevelt's New Deal policies. Each was a strong supporter of fiscal conservatism and states' rights. Glass and Byrd invoked senatorial courtesy to defeat Roosevelt's nomination of Floyd H. Roberts to a federal judgeship, as part of a broader conflict over control of federal patronage in Virginia. Glass served in the U.S. Senate for the remainder of his life, turning down the offer of a new appointment as Secretary of the Treasury from President Roosevelt in 1933. When the Democrats regained control of the Senate that year, Glass became Chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He was President pro tempore from 1941 to 1945, being succeeded as such by Kenneth McKellar at the start of the custom of giving that post to the senior senator of the majority party. As a Senator, Glass's most notable achievement was passage of the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act, which separated the activities of banks and securities brokers and created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. A less successful minor legislative initiative from Glass was a 1930 resolution to ban dial telephones from the Senate, a measure that was successfully resisted by younger Senators who favored dial telephony. ==Electoral history== * 1902; Glass was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives with 79.41% of the vote, defeating Republican Aaron Graham, Independent Republican James S. Cowden, and Socialist Labor H.D. McTier. * 1904; Glass was re-elected with 69.07% of the vote, defeating Republican Samuel H. Hoge and Socialist Elory R. Spencer. * 1906; Glass was re-elected unopposed. * 1908; Glass was re-elected with 65.92% of the vote, defeating Republicans M. Hartman and John M. Parsons and Independent Jacob Harvey. * 1910; Glass was re-elected with 87.64% of the vote, defeating Republican William F. Allison. * 1912; Glass was re-elected with 72.84% of the vote, defeating Populist James S. Browning and Independents Adon A. Yoder and Jacob Harvey. * 1914; Glass was re-elected with 90.72% of the vote, defeating Socialist B.F. Ginther. * 1916; Glass was re-elected unopposed. * 1918; Glass was re-elected unopposed. ==Family, decline, death== Glass's Montview historical marker in Lynchburg, Virginia When he was twenty- eight, Glass married Aurelia McDearmon Caldwell, a school teacher. They had four children. She died of a heart ailment in 1937. Glass remarried in 1940 at the age of 82. His second wife, Mary Scott, was his constant companion as his health began to fail over the next few years. They lived at the Mayflower Hotel Apartments in Washington, D.C. Starting in 1942, Glass began suffering from various age-related illnesses and could not attend Senate meetings after that time. However, he refused to resign from the Senate, despite many requests that he do so, and even kept his committee chairmanship. Many visitors were also kept away from him by his wife. A confidential 1943 analysis of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by Isaiah Berlin for the British Foreign Office stated that Glass is very old and frail and something of a legend in the South. The fruit-growing interests of his State make him an opponent of the reciprocal trade pacts, but on all other questions he has loyally supported the President's anti-Isolationist policy. He cannot have many years of active service before him.\\"}} Glass died of congestive heart failure in Washington, D.C., on May 28, 1946. He is interred at Spring Hill Cemetery in Lynchburg. His fellow sponsor of the Glass-Owen Act, Senator Robert Latham Owen, lies nearby. ==Legacy== \\"Montview\\", also known as the \\"Carter Glass Mansion\\", was built in 1923 on his farm outside of the-then boundaries of Lynchburg in Campbell County. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and now serves as a museum on the grounds of Liberty University. It lies within the expanded city limits of Lynchburg. The front lawn of \\"Montview\\" is the burial site of Dr. Jerry Falwell, founder of Liberty University. The Virginia Department of Transportation's Carter Glass Memorial Bridge was named in his honor in 1949. It carries the Lynchburg bypass of U.S. Route 29, the major north-south highway in the region, across the James River between Lynchburg and Amherst County. A chair in the Department of Government was created in Glass's honor at Sweet Briar College. It has been held by notable faculty including Dr. Barbara A. Perry. Glass Hall at Harvard Business School was named in his honor. It is one of seven buildings named for notable secretaries of the United States Treasury at the suggestion of donor George Fisher Baker. As of 1984, it has been repurposed as an updated administrative space for the school's Executive Education programs. Glass is one of the few Americans to appear on a U.S. coin during his lifetime. As a very prominent citizen of the city of Lynchburg, the 1936 Lynchburg Sesquicentennial commemorative half dollar has his image and name on the obverse.

Founded in 1941 in Paris by Jacques Duclos, Andre Pican and Pierre Villon, along with their wives all members of the French Communist Party (PCF) they felt that to be a vital force against the Nazis, the collaborationists and the informers that all of the Resistance movements, no matter their party or Religion(Jewish or Catholic) had to band together. Its name was inspired by the Popular Front, a left-wing coalition which governed France from 1936 to 1938. This helped them coordinate attacks all across France, to move weapons, food, false identity papers, information and food, protect and move people who were to be arrested or executed and supply multiple safe houses for the Resistance and for Jews. They also formed fighting units in early 1942 to assassinate German leaders and soldiers among the occupation forces, perform acts of sabotage on railroads and other forms of distribution of people and goods being taken from France to Germany and to help organize sabotage in factories forced to produce armaments and goods for the German military. == The political front of the FTP == The National Front (FN) was destined to be the \\"political representative\\" of the armed force called the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP). It engaged mainly in propaganda, editing reviews, fabricating false identity documents, supporting clandestine organizations logistically, and sabotaging German and Vichy facilities and capabilities. It was a member of the Conseil national de la R√©sistance (CNR), which federated, under Jean Moulin's authority, various Resistance movements, beginning in the middle of 1943. Led by Pierre Villon, it then extended itself to Catholics and other religious resistants. Pierre Villon stated: \\"The FN is the only movement where we have finally reconciled the parish priest (cur√©) and the teacher, the Parti Social Fran√ßais and the Communist, and the Radical with the Socialist.\\" Front National de la R√©sistance , memory site Various specialized professional organizations were created under the authority of the Front National (the workers' Front National, the peasants' Front National, the lawyers' Front National, the doctors' Front National, the women's Front National, etc.). After the invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, L'Humanit√©, in its issues of July 2 and July 7, wrote: \\"Unite yourself, refuse to serve under fascism!\\" At that time, the FTP armed wing had already been active since 1941, but the Resistance quickly expanded itself during 1942 and 1943. The French population's morale improved as the difficulties faced by the Wehrmacht increased, in particular during the protracted Battle of Stalingrad. The 4 September 1942 Law on the STO (Service du travail obligatoire), signed by Pierre Laval, the head of government in the Vichy r√©gime, proposed to exchange one prisoner-of-war for three Frenchmen to go to work in Nazi Germany. This was an important cause of the Resistance's dramatic increase in numbers, inspiring many young male adults to stand up and volunteer for the Maquis. At the time of the liberation of Paris, after the deportation and death of many of the members of the original clandestine leadership, the FN resistance movement counted such figures as Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie, Pierre Villon, Henri Wallon, Laurent Casanova, Fran√ßois Mauriac, and Louis Aragon among its members. == Legal ownership of the name, \\"Front National\\" == A juridical battle between the far-right Front National and Bruno M√©gret's splinter party, the National Republican Movement (MNR), for the name, \\"Front national,\\" in December 1998 and January 1999, prompted the satirical newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, to outrace both by deposing at the National Industrial Property Institute (INPI), the national institute in charge of trademarks, the term \\"Front National,\\" in order to give its juridical ownership back to the original Resistance movement of that name.

The oldest part of the existing castle is a mid-15th century walled bawn, cornered on the northeast and northwest by towers. ==History of Ormonde Castle== Built before 1315, the original castle was acquired that year by the Butler Family after it was taken from the Wall Family. James Butler would eventually be granted the title 1st Earl of Ormond. ==The manor house== Ormonde Castle Sometime after 1565, Thomas Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormonde, (referred to sometimes as the 10th Earl of Ormonde) spent many years at the court of his cousin, through Anne Boleyn, Queen Elizabeth I. He carried from England a regard for Elizabethan-style architecture, and added a Tudor manor house to the property, the first of its kind in Ireland. In the 17th century the house was a favourite residence for James Butler, the 'Great Duke of Ormonde,' but the Butlers abandoned the home after James' death in 1688. The home remained a possession of the family until the middle of the 20th century. In 1947 the house was given over to state agencies who restored the historic structures. The manor house is enhanced by the mullioned windows on both floors to the front and the oriel windows of the porch in the centre of the facade. The gallery on the first floor features two carved stone chimney pieces and a ceiling and frieze of Elizabethan plaster-work. The U-shape of the manor house surrounds a small courtyard that abuts the north of the castle's bawn. The manor has two floors and a gabled attic. The most notable restoration achievement was that of the long gallery on the first floor of the facade, where the ceiling had largely collapsed. This room, once hung with tapestries, has a magnificent limestone fireplace bearing the date 1565, and has stucco representations of Queen Elizabeth flanked by Equity and Justice. It is said that she had promised her cousin that she would one day visit. ==Namesake in the United States== *Ormond Plantation House in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana -- named Ormond by Colonel Richard Butler, the owner from 1805 to 1819 ==References== ==External links== * Ormond Castle - official site at Heritage Ireland Category:National Monuments in County Tipperary Category:Historic house museums in the Republic of Ireland Category:Museums in County Tipperary Category:Castles in County Tipperary Category:Carrick-on-Suir Category:History of County Tipperary ","title":"Ormonde Castle"},{"id":"844724","text":"Patricia Collins Wrede (; born March 27, 1953) is an American author of fantasy literature. She is known for her Enchanted Forest Chronicles series for young adults, which was voted number 84 in NPR's 100 Best-Ever Teen Novels list. == Career == Wrede graduated from Carleton College in 1974 with a BA in biology and obtained an MBA from University of Minnesota in 1977. She finished her first book in 1978 while working as an accountant and financial analyst. She was a founding member of The Scribblies, along with Pamela Dean, Emma Bull, Will Shetterly, Steven Brust and Nate Bucklin, in January 1980, \\"to which [she] belonged for five extremely productive years.\\" She sold her first book to Ace in April 1980 and it was published in 1982. In the fall of 1980, Wrede met Lillian Stewart Carl, who introduced her to Lois McMaster Bujold. In 1985, shortly before her fifth book was published, she became a full-time writer. She is a member of the Liavek shared-world anthology. In 2009, Wrede donated her archive to the department of Rare Books and Special Collections at Northern Illinois University.Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) Collection , Northern Illinois University Lois McMaster Bujold credits the support of Wrede and Lillian Stewart Carl for allowing Bujold to finish her first novel: \\"These friendships were lifelines in every sense\\". ==Personal life== She was born in Chicago, IL on March 27, 1953 to David Merrill and Monica Marie Collins. She is the eldest of five siblings.

Patricia and James Wrede were married in 1976; they divorced in 1991. She is a vegetarian and lives in the Twin Cities with two cats. ==Books== ===Lyra=== These books share a common setting on a world named Lyra, and are listed here in order of publication. As the books are only loosely connected, they may be read in any order, though order of publication is probably preferable. # Shadow Magic (1982) # Daughter of Witches (1983) # The Harp of Imach Thyssel (1985) # Caught in Crystal (1987) # The Raven Ring (1994) * Shadows over Lyra (omnibus edition including the first three Lyra novels published) (1997) (Illustrated by Anne Yvonne Gilbert) The actual chronological order of the books is Caught in Crystal, The Raven Ring, Shadow Magic, Daughter of Witches, and The Harp of Imach Thyssel. The last three are set in the same time period but different nations while the first two are spaced widely apart chronologically and happen well before the events of the last three. A timeline and short world history at the end of Shadows over Lyra ties everything together and answers a lot of questions. The omnibus edition of Shadow Magic is a revised one; the writing is significantly different from that in the original, and reflects her greater experience as a writer. It seems that Wrede rewrote the story for the omnibus, but this is not actually noted anywhere in the book itself. ===The Enchanted Forest Chronicles=== This series features Princess Cimorene, as she becomes a dragon's princess, rescues said dragon, falls in love, and ultimately saves the enchanted forest. It is usually marketed for young adults. The fourth book (told from the perspective of Cimorene's son, Daystar) was written and published first, but is considered to properly go last in the series. The 1995 edition of Talking to Dragons is significantly different from the original 1985 edition, mostly to make it more consistent with the story in the other books. # Dealing with Dragons (1990) # Searching for Dragons (1991) # Calling on Dragons (1993) # Talking to Dragons (1985, revised 1995) ===Cecelia and Kate=== with Caroline Stevermer The authors tell these stories from the first- person perspectives of cousins Kate and Cecelia (and, in the third book, two additional characters), who recount their adventures in magic and polite society. These works are unusual in modern fiction in being epistolary novels, written using the style of the letter game. # Sorcery and Cecelia or The Enchanted Chocolate Pot: Being the Correspondence of Two Young Ladies of Quality Regarding Various Magical Scandals in London and the Country (1988, reprinted 2003) # The Grand Tour or The Purloined Coronation Regalia: Being a Revelation of Matters of High Confidentiality and Greatest Importance, Including Extracts from the Intimate Diary of a Noblewoman and the Sworn Testimony of a Lady of Quality (2004) # The Mislaid Magician or Ten Years After: Being the Private Correspondence Between Two Prominent Families Regarding a Scandal Touching the Highest Levels of Government and the Security of the Realm (2006) * Magic Below Stairs (2010) was written by Caroline Stevermer alone, and is set in the same universe after The Grand Tour, but before The Mislaid Magician. It follows the character Frederick Lincoln as a child in the house of the Schofields. \\\\- The first two books in this series (Sorcery and Cecelia and The Grand Tour) were published in an omnibus edition, Magicians of Quality, in 2005. ====Plot==== At the beginning of the first book, Katherine Talgarth (\\"Kate\\") and her beautiful younger sister Georgina have been taken by their Aunt Charlotte Rushton from Rushton (in Essex) to London to experience part of the Season. Kate's parents, George Talgarth and Celia Rushton, have both died at least five years before. Kate's favorite cousin, Cecelia Rushton (\\"Cecy\\"), has been left at home with her brother Oliver and their father, the antiquarian Arthur Rushton, at Rushton Manor. Oliver and Cecy's mother died when Cecy was quite young. Their father's other unmarried sister, Aunt Elizabeth Rushton, lives with them at Rushton Manor. ===Magic and Malice=== \\"Mairelon\\" is a gentleman wizard with unusual talents, and Kim is his streetwise prot√©g√©e. Together, they foil plots and generally get into trouble. From a reference to the date being thirty years since the Terror, the novels take place about 1823, during the Regency era in its broader sense; however, the author has personally stated that the events of Magician's Ward take place in 1818. # Mairelon the Magician (1991) # Magician's Ward (1997) The two novels have also been published in omnibus editions: in hardcover as Magic & Malice (1999), and as trade paperback as A Matter of Magic (2010). ===Frontier Magic=== A trilogy narrated by Eff Rothmer, the \\"thirteenth child\\" of the opening book title. Book One covers her childhood, from the age of five (when her parents move west to the edge of the expanding American frontier) to shortly after her eighteenth birthday. Books Two and Three deal with an adult Eff's work as an explorer, scientist, and magician beyond the edge of the frontier. # Thirteenth Child (2009) # Across the Great Barrier (2011) # The Far West (2012) ===Others=== * The Seven Towers (1984) * Snow White and Rose Red (1989) * Book of Enchantments (1996) * Star Wars, Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace (Jr. Novelization) (1999) * Star Wars, Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones (Jr. Novelization) (2002) * Star Wars, Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith (Jr. Novelization) (2005) The Seven Towers is a stand-alone fantasy novel.

Sex verification in sports (also known as gender verification, or loosely as gender determination or a sex test) occurs because eligibility of athletes to compete is restricted (in theory) whenever sporting events are limited to a single sex, which is generally the case, as well as when events are limited to mixed-sex teams of defined composition (e.g., most pairs events). Practice has varied tremendously over time, across borders and by competitive level. Issues have arisen multiple times in the Olympic games and other high-profile sporting competitions, for example allegations that certain male athletes attempted to compete as women or that certain female athletes had intersex conditions that gave unfair advantage. The first mandatory sex test issued by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the world's track and field governing body, for woman athletes was in July 1950 in the month before the European Championships in Belgium. All athletes were tested in their own countries. Sex testing at the actual games began with the 1966 European Athletics Championships‚Äô response to suspicion that several of the best women athletes from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were actually men. At the Olympics, testing was introduced in 1968. In some cases, these policies have led to athletes undergoing unnecessary surgery such as female genital mutilation and sterilization. Subsequent reports have shown that the tests could cause psychological harm. Sex verification‚Äîidentifying athletes whose hormone levels are abnormal compared to others of their purported sex ‚Äî can cause sex identity crises, elicit demeaning reactions (publicly and privately), isolate athletes socially, and lead to depression and sometimes suicide. ==History== Initially, sex verification took the form of physical examinations. It subsequently evolved into chromosome testing, later testosterone level testing. It is not always simply checking whether a person's sex chromosome pair is XX vs. XY, or comparing their levels of key sex hormones to distinct reference ranges, to determine an athlete's sex. Variations in pairings of inherited chromosome, other genetic aspects, and pre- and postnatal physical development at subcellular to organ levels mean some people are not unambiguously female or male. Fetuses start out as undifferentiated, then the SRY gene ( which is usually‚Äîbut not always‚Äîlocated on the Y chromosome) turns on a variety of hormones that differentiate by the time of birth the newborn as a male baby. But sometimes this differentiation does not occur while other times the SRY gene is located on a different chromosome: People with two X chromosomes can develop hormonally or phenotypically as a male; and people with an X and a Y can develop hormonally or phenotypically as a female. Testosterone testing is not a valid form of testing because they can have certain levels and still be a different sex. Males can have low levels of testosterone and still be males. Females can have high levels of testosterone and still be female, not making any difference to their identified sex. ===Physical examinations=== United States Olympic Committee president Avery Brundage requested, during or shortly after the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, that a system be established to examine female athletes. According to a Time magazine article about hermaphrodites, Brundage felt the need to clarify \\"sex ambiguities\\" after observing the performance of Czechoslovak runner and jumper Zde≈àka Koubkov√° and English shotputter and javelin thrower Mary Edith Louise Weston. Both individuals later had gender reassignment surgery and legally changed their names, to Zdenƒõk Koubek and Mark Weston, respectively.\\"Change of Sex \\" 24 August 1936 Time File:Zdenka Koubkova 1936.jpgZdenƒõk Koubek File:Mary Edith Louise Weston 1936b.jpgMark Weston Sex verification tests began in 1950 with the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), using physical examinations. \\"Sex segregation and verification are mutually interdependent because, if there were no claims or basis for having separate male and female sporting events, there would be no need for sex verification testing.\\" The Dutch athlete Foekje Dillema was banned for life in July 1950. The International Olympic Committee followed suit in 1968. Initially, women athletes \\"were asked to parade nude before a panel of doctors\\". For a period of time these tests were mandatory for female athletes, due to fears that male athletes would pose as female athletes and have an unfair advantage over their competitors. Throughout the years of physical examinations of looking at Females bodies and seeing if everything was in the right place they then went to chromosome testing and realized both were very inaccurate tests and could not prove much. After critics convinced officials that genetic testing was scientifically and ethically flawed for this purpose, the IOC replaced the policy in 1999 with a system allowing for medical evaluations of an athlete‚Äôs sex only in cases of ‚Äúreasonable suspicion,‚Äù but this system also created injustice for athletes and stoked international controversies. ===Chromosome testing=== Chromosome testing was introduced by the International Olympic Committee during the 1968 Summer Olympics. This tested for the Y-chromosome, and was designed to identify males potentially disguised as females. This method of testing was later abolished, as it was shown to be inconclusive in identifying maleness. The International Association of Athletics Federations ceased sex screening for all athletes in 1992, but retained the option of assessing the sex of a participant should suspicions arise. A resolution was passed at the 1996 International Olympic Committee (IOC) World Conference on Women and Health \\"to discontinue the current process of gender verification during the Olympic Games\\". The International Olympic Committee's board voted to discontinue the practice in June 1999. Chromosome testing was last performed at the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996. === Hormone testing === SA runner Caster Semenya subject to Hormone Test In August 2009, South African athlete Caster Semenya was subjected to mandatory sex verification testing at the request of the IAAF. In the wake of the Semenya case, testosterone testing was introduced to identify cases where testosterone levels were elevated above a particular level, termed hyperandrogenism, with national Olympics committees tasked by the IOC to \\"actively investigate any perceived deviation in sex characteristics\\". In football, FIFA's current gender verification policy dates to 30 May 2011. In June 2012, in advance of the 2012 Summer Olympics, the IOC released IOC Regulations on Female Hyperandrogenism to address these cases. It includes the statement, \\"Nothing in these Regulations is intended to make any determination of sex. Instead, these Regulations are designed to identify circumstances in which a particular athlete will not be eligible (by reason of hormonal characteristics) to participate in 2012 Olympic Games (OG) Competitions in the female category. In the event that the athlete has been declared ineligible to compete in the female category, the athlete may be eligible to compete as a male athlete, if the athlete qualifies for the male event of the sport.\\" As with previous forms of sex testing, testosterone testing has been regarded as humiliating, unnecessary and discriminatory. Katrina Karkazis, Rebecca Jordan-Young, Georgiann Davis and Silvia Camporesi argued that the new IAAF policies on hyperandrogenism in female athletes will not protect against breaches of privacy, will require athletes to undergo unnecessary treatment in order to compete, and will intensify \\"gender policing\\". In fact, high-performing female athletes show a rate of Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome much higher than the general population‚Äîwhich shows 1 in 20,000‚Äì50,000, compared with elite athletes‚Äô 1 in 429. They recommend that athletes be able to compete in accordance with their legal gender. In 2013, it was reported by Patrick F√©nichel, St√©phane Bermon and others that four elite female athletes from developing countries were subjected to partial clitoridectomies (a form of female genital mutilation) and gonadectomies (sterilization) after testosterone testing revealed their previously unknown intersex conditions. Members of the same clinical hormone evaluation team report there is no evidence that innate hyperandrogenism in elite women athletes confers an advantage in sport. Raised levels of testosterone have not been shown to give an unfair advantage to the athlete. Scholars question whether any advantage should be considered ‚Äúunfair‚Äù if it occurs naturally and outside the control of the athlete. For example, elite athletes have greater aerobic capacity and endurance in comparison to the general population. Furthermore, these cases have elicited criticism of the elite sporting system by showing clear vulnerability of women athletes to unnecessary medical interventions under duress, applied even though there was no evidence of cheating and no evidence of athletic advantage. Policies on hyperandrogenism were suspended following the case of Dutee Chand v. Athletics Federation of India (AFI) & The International Association of Athletics Federations, in the Court of Arbitration for Sport, decided in July 2015. Chand had been dropped from the 2014 Commonwealth Games at the last minute after the Athletic Federation of India stated that hyperandrogenism made her ineligible to compete as a female athlete. The ruling found that there was insufficient evidence that testosterone increased female athletic performance. In doing so the court immediately suspended the practice of hyperandrogenism regulation used by the IAAF and declared it void unless the organization could present better evidence by July 2017. In November 2015, the IOC held a meeting to address both its hyperandrogenism and transgender policies. In regards to hyperadrogenism in female athletes, the IOC encouraged reinstatement of the IAAF policies suspended by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. It also repeated an earlier policy statement that, to \\"avoid discrimination, if not eligible for female competition the athlete should be eligible to compete in male competition\\". In February 2016, it was made known that the IOC would not introduce its own policies that would impose a maximum testosterone level for the 2016 Summer Olympics. On November 1 of 2018 the IAAF adopted new criteria regarding \\"Differences of Sexual Development\\" for female athletes competing in the following races: 400 m, 800 m, 1 mile, hurdles, and events that include a combination of these distances. Athletes with testosterone levels equalling or exceeding 5 nmol/L or who are \\"androgen sensitive\\" and want to participate in above-mentioned events at the global level (including recognition for setting an international record) must legally be female or intersex, must get their testosterone levels below 5nmol/L for six consecutive months and must ensure their levels stay below this level. This new regulation replaced all previous rules implemented regarding women with Hyperandrogenism. In April 2016, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on health, Dainius P≈´ras, criticized current and historic sex verification policies, describing how \\"a number of athletes have undergone gonadectomy (removal of reproductive organs) and partial cliteroidectomy in the absence of symptoms or health issues warranting those procedures\\". The cases of Dutee Chand and Caster Semenya were widely reported during the 2016 Rio Olympics. Immediately preceding the games, Genel, Simpson and de la Chapelle were again published in Journal of the American Medical Association stating: ===Sex verification of men=== Sex verification is not conducted on athletes competing in the male category, and little data are available on their chromosomes or hormone profiles. However, a post- competition study of 693 elite athletes by Healy et al., published in 2014, found significant differences along many variables. The authors found that: Using these data, Scientific American estimated that \\"almost 2 percent\\" of male competitors had testosterone levels in the typical female range. The study authors also stated that average lean body mass differences might account for performance differences between sexes. Concern over men competing as women to gain an unfair advantage in sport competition is what drives sex verification. ===20th century=== * Perhaps the earliest known case is that of Stanis≈Çawa Walasiewicz (aka Stella Walsh), a Polish athlete who won a gold medal in the women's 100 m at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, but who after her death in 1980 was discovered to have had partially developed male genitalia. * Before the advent of sexual verification tests, German athlete Dora Ratjen competed in the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin and placed fourth in the women's high jump. She later competed and set a world record for the women's high jump at the 1938 European Championships before tests by the German police concluded that Ratjen was a man. Ratjen was likely an intersex individual, based on the physician's description who conducted the examination. Though raised as a girl, Ratjen later took the name Heinrich Ratjen following an official registry change. * The Dutch sprinter Foekje Dillema was expelled from the 1950 national team after she refused a mandatory sex test in July 1950; later investigations revealed a Y-chromosome in her body cells, and the analysis showed that she probably was a 46,XX/46,XY mosaic female. * Sisters Tamara and Irina Press won five track and field Olympic gold medals for the Soviet Union and set 26 world records in the 1960s. They ended their careers before the introduction of gender testing in 1966. Although both sisters were accused of being men or hermaphrodites, there is no evidence of an intersex condition in these cases.Robert Pool, \\"Eve‚Äôs Rib - Searching for the Biological Roots of Sex Differences\\", Crown Publishers, New York City, 1994, The Press sisters started speculation on their identified sex because they retired in 1965 and tests began the following year but there were rumors that they had DSD which means Disorders of sex development and therefore that is why they chose to retire although that has never been proven false or true. * Polish athlete Ewa K≈Çobukowska, who won the gold medal in women's 4 √ó 100 m relay and the bronze medal in women's 100 m sprint at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, is the first athlete to fail a gender test in 1967. She was found to have the rare genetic condition of XX/XXY mosaicism and was banned from competing in Olympic and professional sports. * In 1967 the IOC disqualified the Austrian 1966 female world champion in downhill skiing, Erika Schinegger, from the 1968 Winter Games in Grenoble after determining Schinegger had internal male sex organs. Schinegger later transitioned to a male, Erik. * In 1986, Spanish hurdler Maria Jos√© Mart√≠nez-Pati√±o was dismissed and publicly shamed after failing a chromosomal test. She fought the ruling against her, arguing that she could not have a competitive advantage because her intersex variation resulted in her having no functional testosterone. Two years later, the IAAF gave Mart√≠nez-Pati√±o the green light to compete again. Her plight brought attention to the issue of gender testing, which helped lead to the end of mandatory tests a decade later.

After her victory at the 2009 World Championships, it was announced that she had been subjected to gender testing. The IAAF confirmed that Semenya had agreed to a sex-testing process that began in South Africa and would continue in Germany. On 6 July 2010, the IAAF confirmed that Semenya was cleared to continue competing as a woman. The results of the gender testing were never officially released for privacy reasons.. In 2018, the IAAF announced new rules that once again prevented Semenya from running, rules that are thought the rule change was designed specifically to target Semenya. * In 2012, after female Indian track athlete Pinki Pramanik was accused by a female roommate of rape and later charged, she was gender tested and declared a male although she and other medical experts dispute the claims. Pramanik disagreed with these results and police ordered a separate government-led test as part of the trial. The SSKM Government Hospital declared the results to be inconclusive. The Court then directed a chromosome pattern test. * Four unnamed women athletes from developing countries were subjected to gonadectomies (a form of sterilization) and female genital mutilation as part of a process to enable them to compete. The female athletes were discovered to have an intersex trait during testosterone testing; the case was first published in 2013. *Dutee Chand was dropped from the 2014 Commonwealth Games at the last minute after the Athletic Federation of India stated that hyperandrogenism made her ineligible to compete as a female athlete. Chand took a case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and won an interim judgment in mid-2015. In February 2016, it was made known that the IOC would not impose a maximum testosterone level for the 2016 Summer Olympics. In June 2016, Chand qualified to compete in the 100 metres race at the Summer Olympics. ==Transgender athletes== In November 2015, the IOC held a meeting to address both its transgender and hyperandrogenism policies. In regard to transgender athletes it stated that transgender athletes cannot be excluded from an opportunity to participate in sporting competition. Transgender athletes who identified themselves as female would be allowed to compete in that category as long as their testosterone levels were below 10 nanomoles per litre for at least 12 months prior to the competition. There would be no restrictions on transgender athletes who identify and compete as male. \\"Transgender people can be defined as those whose gender identity‚Äîan innate sense of whether one is male, female, or somewhere in between‚Äîdiffers from their assigned sex at birth.\\" Professional track runner Stella Walsh won the Olympic gold medal in the women's 100 meter dash in as early as 1932. Many women weren't openly competing as transgender during this time but they tended to keep a low profile to cause such controversy or be seen as a threat. The start of the 21st century showed a great amount of transgender athletes now competing at all levels which include high school, college, and even professional sports. * Professional tennis player Ren√©e Richards, a transgender woman, was barred from playing as a woman at the 1976 US Open unless she submitted to chromosome testing. She sued the United States Tennis Association and in 1977 won the right to play as a woman without submitting to testing. == Ethics related to sex verification == === Chromosome testing === The practice of chromosome testing came under scrutiny from those who feel that the testing was humiliating, socially insensitive, and neither accurate nor effective. The testing is especially difficult for people who could be considered intersex. Genetic differences can allow a person to have a male genetic make-up and female anatomy or body chemistry. In the Journal of the American Medical Association, Simpson, Ljungqvist and others stated, === Hormone testing === Women with higher levels of androgen (particularly testosterone) are often considered to have a competitive advantage over other women since women statistically have lower levels than men. This difference in androgen levels is the reason many sports requiring athletes compete only among their own sex. However, others argue that expecting women athletes with naturally higher levels of testosterone to lower these levels by medical/pharmaceutical methods completely contradicts the purpose of doping regulations, which require athletes not take any substances that their bodies do not generate naturally. In January 2010 in Miami, instead of succeeding in improving the policies specifying whether an athlete should participate as a woman or a male, medical professionals experienced ambiguity in regards to these policies. Alice Dreger states it is risky to publicly reveal that an athlete is no longer allowed to compete as a woman without first informing the athlete. For example, Caster Semenya found out through public media that the tests she had taken were meant to determine whether she is female or male. Another athlete, Santhi Soundarjan, tried to commit suicide subsequent to failing the test for determining her gender and being stripped of her 2016 Asian Games medal. A scholar questions whether men with androgen levels similar to those of women will be permitted to participate in the women's category or instead be granted the opportunity to increase their androgen levels to those of other males. This is the logical and fair result how policies using functional testosterone to decide eligibility to compete as a female or a male work for women. Males with Klinefelter Syndrome/XXY chromosomes are in this position but nonetheless usually cannot compete while utilizing testosterone because of their medical situation. In the Semenya case the fact that they found high testosterone levels and were going back and forth on her gender verification affected her mental health. By contradicting her sex they were violating laws by international and national genetic privacy laws. Gender verification impacts numerous dimensions of athletes' lives, including unfair disqualification in sporting events, identity crisis and confusion, social isolation, depression, and suicide. === Transgender athletes === Transgender athletes who wish to compete in the female category are allowed to do so if their testosterone levels are in accordance with the required levels. However, the IOC stated that requiring surgical anatomical changes as a requirement for participation may be considered a violation of human rights. Athletics may for some transgender people engage them within greater society in affirming ways. However, others opposed the participation of transgender athletes on women's teams state that the argument is unsound. Athletes who have faced opposition include Mianne Bagger, Martine Delaney (who participated in \\"Soccer Tasmanian's women's league\\") and Lana Lawless. == See also == * Gender * Intersex human rights * Sexual differentiation * Transgender people in sports ==Notes== ==References== Category:Sports medicine Category:Sex ","title":"Sex verification in sports"},{"id":"844746","text":"The Journal of Mundane Behavior was a triannual peer-reviewed academic journal of sociology covering everyday behavior and experiences.

He gained a reputation as an expert on medieval buildings and applied this expertise to his new buildings and his restorations. He restored castles and country houses, and built a number of new houses and churches. ==Early life and training== He was born in Sunderland Bridge, County Durham, as the only child of General Anthony Salvin, a soldier, and his second wife Elizabeth (Eliza) Mills. He was educated at Durham School and in 1820 became a pupil of John Patersonhttp://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=202022 of Edinburgh while he was working on the restoration of Brancepeth Castle in County Durham. In 1821 Salvin moved to Finchley in north London. He had an introduction to Sir John Soane but did not enter his office. According to his nephew he entered the office of John Nash. In 1824 he was elected as a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. Soon after this he went on a sketching tour of Great Britain. On 26 July 1826 he married his cousin, Anne Andrews Nesfield. With her he had six children, two of whom died in infancy. ==Early career== Salvin's first major commission was Mamhead House in Devon for Robert William Newman. This was designed in the Tudor style to a symmetrical plan. It was adapted from a plan by Charles Fowler and this placed restrictions on his design. His next design was for Moreby Hall in the East Riding of Yorkshire for Henry Preston where he was free to develop a complete design in the Tudor style, again on a symmetrical plan. At Scotney Castle in Kent he designed for Edward Hussey an asymmetrical design in the Tudor style. In 1831 Salvin embarked on what is considered to be his most important early domestic work at Harlaxton Manor in Lincolnshire for Gregory Gregory. Salvin's design combined elements from Montacute House in Somerset and Hengrave Hall in Suffolk. However, before the building was complete, Salvin was replaced as architect by William Burn. In 1835 Salvin spent five weeks in Germany. In 1836 Salvin entered a design in Tudor style in the competition for the new Palace of Westminster which had possibly been inspired by his visit to Germany. However this was unsuccessful, as was his entry for the competition to design the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. He won the competition for the design of the Carlton Club in Pall Mall, London, but the club decided not to proceed with his plan. After losing a further competition, this time to design the Army and Navy Club, Salvin did not enter any more competitions. ==Mature career== Church of St Stephen and St Thomas, Shepherd's Bush Most of Salvin's designs for major houses continued to be in the Tudor style. These include Keele Hall in Staffordshire for Ralph Sneyd, and Thoresby Hall in Nottinghamshire for Sydney Pierrepont, 3rd Earl Manvers. There were exceptions, including Penoyre House in Brecon, an Italianate villa-style house for Colonel John Lloyd Vaughan Watkins and Oxon Hoath in West Peckham, Kent in the French Ch√¢teauesque style for Sir William Geary. A major part of Salvin's work was to restore, refit and create castles. In 1835 he refaced Norwich Castle, in 1844 he repaired the ruins of Newark Castle and in 1845 he repaired the ruins of Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight. In the early 1840s the Queen's Gate of Caernarvon Castle collapsed, and in 1844 Salvin repaired it and rebuilt some of the other masonry of the castle. He also restored Naworth Castle in Cumbria after it was damaged by a fire on 18May 1844. In 1851 he surveyed the Beauchamp Tower of the Tower of London and subsequently restored the Salt, Wakefield and White Towers and the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula. Following this he was instructed by Prince Albert to carry out work on Windsor Castle. This included replacing sash windows with lancets and mullioned windows and rebuilding the Clewer Tower. Salvin designed Peckforton Castle in Cheshire for John Tollemache, 1st Baron Tollemache as a recreation of a castle of the time of Edward I. In 1852 he started work on the restoration of Alnwick Castle in Northumberland. This included replacing one of the towers with a larger tower, the Prudhoe Tower, creating a porte-coch√®re, replacing windows and replanning the interior. Salvin also restored and repaired 20 old churches and three cathedrals, and built 34 new churches. In the early 1840s he had worked on The Holy Sepulchre, Cambridge, employing James Rattee, and following this he was made an honorary member of the Cambridge Camden Society. He arranged for the removal of buildings around the south transept of Norwich Cathedral and reordered its choir. He also made alterations to Durham and Wells Cathedrals. In all he designed at least 34 new churches. Salvin's restorations were not to the liking of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, particularly his removal of \\"unwanted fabric\\" from churches. Other work carried out by Salvin included rebuilding the keep of Durham Castle for student accommodation, and work on restoring Trinity College, Cambridge. ==Later life== In 1857, while working on Warwick Castle, Salvin suffered a stroke but recovered from it. In 1860, his wife died and he designed a new house for himself, Hawksfold at Fernhurst, Sussex. In 1863 he was awarded the royal gold medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects and in 1879 he retired from formal practice. He died at Hawksfold in 1881 and was buried at Fernhurst. His estate was valued at over ¬£78,000. ==See also== *List of new churches by Anthony Salvin *List of church restorations and alterations by Anthony Salvin *List of work on castles and country houses by Anthony Salvin *List of miscellaneous works by Anthony Salvin ==References== ==External Links== * Parliamentary Archives, Salvin Papers Category:1799 births Category:1881 deaths Category:People educated at Durham School Category:Architects from County Durham Category:Gothic Revival architects Category:English ecclesiastical architects Category:Recipients of the Royal Gold Medal Category:Architects of cathedrals ","title":"Anthony Salvin"},{"id":"844769","text":"The Zamzam Well is a well in the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

It is jointly maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT), MTA Bridges and Tunnels (MTAB&T;), and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ). Spanning approximately along a west‚Äìeast axis, I-495 traverses Long Island from the western portal of the Queens‚ÄìMidtown Tunnel in the New York City borough of Manhattan to CR 58 in Riverhead in the east. I-495 intersects with I-295 in Bayside, Queens, through which it connects with I-95. The 2017 route log erroneously shows the section of highway between I-278 in Long Island City and I-678 in Corona as New York State Route 495 (NY 495). The Long Island Expressway designation, despite being commonly applied to I-495 in full, technically refers to the stretch of highway between Nassau and Suffolk counties. The section from the Queens‚ÄìMidtown Tunnel to Queens Boulevard is known as the Queens‚ÄìMidtown Expressway, and the section between Queens Boulevard and the Queens-Nassau county line is known as the Horace Harding Expressway. The service roads which run parallel to either side of the expressway in Queens are signed as Borden Avenue and Queens Midtown Expressway and as Horace Harding Expressway and Horace Harding Boulevard; from the Queens‚ÄìNassau line to Sills Road, they are designated as the unsigned New York State Route 906A and New York State Route 906B. ==Route description== ===New York City=== The expressway begins at the western portal of the Queens‚ÄìMidtown Tunnel in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan. The route heads eastward, passing under FDR Drive and the East River as it proceeds through the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority-maintained tunnel to Queens. Once on Long Island, the highway passes through the tunnel's former toll plaza and becomes known as the Queens‚ÄìMidtown Expressway as it travels through the western portion of the borough. A mile after entering Queens, I-495 meets I-278 (the Brooklyn‚ÄìQueens Expressway) at exit 17\\\\. It continues to the Rego Park neighborhood, where it connects to New York State Route 25 (NY 25, named Queens Boulevard) and becomes the Horace Harding Expressway. I-495 heads northeast through Corona to Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park, intersecting both the Grand Central Parkway and the Van Wyck Expressway (I-678) within the park limits. Because the interchanges in this area are close together, the highway employs two sets of collector/distributor roads through this area: one between 69th and 99th Streets, and one between the Grand Central Parkway and I-678. I-495 in Queens with heavy traffic in both directions. The Long Island Expressway is locally known as \\"the world's longest parking lot\\" The expressway continues east, veering to the southeast to bypass Kissena Park before curving back to the northeast to meet the Clearview Expressway (I-295) at the northern edge of Cunningham Park. Past I-295, I-495 passes by the \\"Queens Giant\\", the oldest and tallest tree in the New York metropolitan area. The tree, located just north of I-495 in Alley Pond Park, is visible from the highway's westbound lanes. To the east, the freeway connects to the Cross Island Parkway at exit 31 in the park prior to exiting the New York City limits, crossing into Nassau County, and becoming the Long Island Expressway (LIE). Although the Long Island Expressway name officially begins outside the New York City border, almost all locals and most signage use \\"the Long Island Expressway\\" or \\"the LIE\\" to refer the entire length of I-495. The service roads of I-495 are called Borden Avenue and Queens Midtown Expressway between the Brooklyn‚ÄìQueens Expressway and Queens Boulevard, and \\"Horace Harding Expressway\\" between Queens Boulevard and the Nassau County line. The Horace Harding Expressway section follows the path of Horace Harding Boulevard (also previously called Nassau Boulevard), which was named for J. Horace Harding (1863‚Äì1929), a finance magnate who directed the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and the New York Municipal Railways System. Harding used his influence to promote the development of Long Island's roadways, lending strong support to Robert Moses's \\"great parkway plan\\". Harding also urged construction of a highway from Queens Boulevard to the Nassau County Line, in order to provide better access to Oakland Country Club, where he was a member. After his death, the boulevard he helped build was named for him. Horace Harding was not related to the former President Warren G. Harding. ===Nassau and Suffolk counties=== Heading into Nassau County, the expressway sports a High-Occupancy Vehicle Lane (HOV), which begins at exit 33 and runs to central Suffolk County. In its run through Nassau, it is the only major east‚Äìwest highway that does not interchange with the Meadowbrook or Wantagh state parkways, both of which end to the south at the adjacent Northern State Parkway, which parallels the LIE through the county. The two highways meet three times, although it actually crosses only once at exit 46 near the county line. I-495 does, however, interchange with the Seaford‚ÄìOyster Bay Expressway (NY 135) as the east‚Äìwest parkways do, and often has heavy traffic. In Suffolk County, the LIE continues its eight-lane configuration with the HOV lane to exit 64 (NY 112). At this point, the HOV lane ends and the highway narrows to six lanes; additionally, the concrete Jersey barrier gives way to a wide, grassy median, the asphalt road surface is replaced by a concrete surface, and the expressway is no longer illuminated by streetlights, reflecting the road's location in a more rural area of Long Island. I-495 in Nassau County From NY 112 east, the expressway runs through more rural, woodland areas on its trek towards Riverhead. Exit 68 (William Floyd Parkway) marks the terminus of the service roads, which are fragmented by this point. Exit 70 (CR 111) in Manorville is the last full interchange, as it is the last interchange that allows eastbound traffic on, and the first to allow westbound off. After exit 71 (NY 24 / Nugent Drive), the expressway begins to narrow as it approaches its eastern terminus. Until 2008, just before exit 72 (NY 25), the three eastbound lanes narrowed to two, which in turn narrowed almost immediately to a single lane at exit 73, which lies east of exit 72\\\\. As of 2008, of the two lanes, one lane is designated for exit 72 and the other is for exit 73, which ends the squeeze into a single lane that formerly existed at exit 73\\\\. At exit 73, all traffic along the expressway is diverted onto a ramp leading to eastbound CR 58, marking the east end of the route. ====HOV restrictions==== There is one HOV lane in each direction, in the median of the highway, between exit 32 (Little Neck Parkway), near the Queens-Nassau border, to exit 64 (NY 112), in central Suffolk County. From 6:00 am to 10:00 am and from 3:00 pm to 8:00 pm Monday through Friday, the HOV lanes are limited to buses, motorcycles, and Clean Pass vehicles without occupancy requirement and passenger vehicles with at least two occupants. Trailers and commercial trucks are always prohibited therein. ==History== ===Construction=== ==== Queens‚ÄìMidtown Expressway ==== The Long Island Expressway was constructed in stages over the course of three decades. The first piece, the Queens‚ÄìMidtown Tunnel linking Manhattan and Queens, was opened to traffic on November 15, 1940. The highway connecting the tunnel to Laurel Hill Boulevard was built around the same time and named the \\"Midtown Highway\\". The tunnel, the Midtown Highway, and the segment of Laurel Hill Boulevard between the highway and Queens Boulevard all became part of a realigned NY 24 in the mid-1940s. Parts of this highway were built on the right of way of a streetcar line that extended from Hunters Point to southern Flushing.\\"Queens Trolley in the 1930s: Future Sites of the Long Island Expressway\\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s449jDBcyWM In 1945, $60 million in funding was allocated toward a plan to upgrade roads in the New York City area. The plan included building the Queens-Midtown Expressway from the Midtown Tunnel to Queens Boulevard, and the Horace Harding Expressway from Queens Boulevard to the New York City border. In the early 1950s, work began along what was Borden Avenue as an eastward extension of the Midtown Highway. The road was completed between 48th and 58th Streets, in February 1955, at which point it became known as the \\"Queens‚ÄìMidtown Expressway\\". November 5, 1955, was the official opening of the highway's 3.2-mile extension to the junction of Queens Boulevard (NY 24 and NY 25) and Horace Harding Boulevard (NY 25D). However, NY 24 initially remained routed on Laurel Hill Boulevard (by this point upgraded into the Brooklyn‚ÄìQueens Expressway) and Queens Boulevard. ==== Horace Harding Expressway and western Nassau ==== Crossing New Calvary Cemetery The LIE was built over much of Horace Harding Boulevard within Eastern Queens and Power House Road within western Nassau County. Prior to the LIE's construction, the route was designated as NY 25D. In May 1951, the New York City Board of Estimate approved the widening of Horace Harding Boulevard and Power House Road to 260 feet, and constructing an expressway in the road's median at a cost of $25 million. The New York State Department of Public Works later modified the highway's route in the vicinity of Little Neck Parkway, near the Queens-Nassau border. At Little Neck Parkway, Horace Harding Boulevard continues northeast and then eastward, whereas the LIE takes a more southerly path. This modification was enacted because of complaints from nearby residents. In 1955, New York State Governor Thomas E. Dewey approved plans for a extension of the LIE between the Queens-Nassau border and Riverhead in Suffolk County. Work began on the Horace Harding Expressway in 1955, but soon encountered delays because of weather conditions, construction worker strikes, and difficulties in building across existing roads and swampy land. The highway had been extended east to Parsons Boulevard in Pomonok, Queens, by 1959, where the highway abruptly terminated and barriers funneled traffic onto the service road. Soon after, the highway was extended to Peck Avenue in Fresh Meadows. Further east in Queens, a section of the highway in the vicinity of Alley Pond Park, between Cloverdale Boulevard in Bayside and Little Neck Parkway, officially opened on September 25, 1957.\\"$8.75-million Expwy Link to Open\\". Daily News (New York, New York). September 24, 1957. p. B7. The highway segment reduced the need for cars to use West Alley Road, a winding road that crossed the park.\\"Expwy Link Slighted ‚Äî Wait Till Weekend\\". Daily News (New York, New York). September 26, 1957. p. XQ3. On September 30, 1958, the first section of the Long Island Expressway outside New York City, a segment from the Queens‚ÄìNassau line to Willis Avenue in Albertson, officially opened to traffic. The section of the Long Island Expressway west of the Clearview Expressway was designated as I-495 in October 1958. The Long Island Expressway's extension to Guinea Woods Road in Roslyn was officially opened on September 29, 1959, which allowed eastbound traffic to continue onto the eastbound Northern State Parkway by using a short ramp, and vice versa for westbound traffic. By this time, the Long Island Expressway was continuous between Bayside and Roslyn, although the portion of the Long Island Expressway near the Clearview Expressway (I-295) was not yet completed. By early 1960, the Long Island Expressway saw more than 120,000 vehicles per day, although congestion frequently built up at Bayside where there was a gap in the Long Island Expressway. The marshy land in the vicinity of Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park caused cracking on the expressway's pavement. The segment of the Long Island Expressway near the Clearview Expressway, between Peck Avenue and 224th Street, and the interchange's eight overpasses and ramps, officially opened on August 12, 1960. ==== Segment east of Roslyn ==== After the opening of the Clearview interchange, the Long Island Expressway was open between Manhattan and Roslyn and entirely designated as NY 24\\\\. The old surface alignment of NY 24 south of the expressway became NY 24A. The LIE was extended east from the Northern State Parkway split to NY 106/107 in Jericho by 1960, and was then opened to South Oyster Bay Road in Syosset in December 1960. By 1962, the NY 24 designation was removed from the LIE and reassigned to its former surface alignment to the south while the portion of the freeway east of the Clearview Expressway became NY 495 (and later, I-495). Over one-third of I-495 within Suffolk County‚Äîa section from Melville to Veterans Memorial Highway (now NY 454) near Islandia‚Äîwas opened to traffic between 1962 and 1963. A 5-mile extension of I-495 from Oyster Bay Road to NY 110 in Melville opened in August 1962, bringing the highway into Suffolk County. This was followed by a extension from NY 110 to Deer Park Road in October of that year, and a further extension to NY 454 in August 1963. Two more sections of I-495‚Äîfrom Islandia to exit 61 in Holbrook and from William Floyd Parkway to exit 71 near Riverhead‚Äîwere completed in the mid-1960s. The section of I-495 between William Floyd Parkway and Riverhead was opened as a discontinuous highway segment in June 1969, and the freeway gap between Holbrook and William Floyd Parkway was filled in December 1969. The last of I-495 from exit 71 to CR 58 were opened to traffic on June 28, 1972. By the time I-495 had been completed, it was being used by over 150,000 vehicles a day. From the outset, a minimum speed limit of was enforced on the segment of I-495 in Nassau and Suffolk counties. ===Improvements=== ====1960s and 1970s==== Traffic volumes on I-495 had grown steadily through the 1960s, growing twenty percent in a three-year period between 1964 and 1967. By the late 1960s, some sections of the highway could no longer handle the amount of traffic that used it each day, and average rush-hour speeds were about . Major chokepoints existed at the intersections of I-278, the Grand Central Parkway, I-678, I-295, and the Cross Island Parkway. Other bottlenecks existed in Elmhurst, Queens, where a westbound exit to Junction Boulevard was immediately adjacent to a westbound entrance from 108th Street. In 1966, the New York City Board of Estimate approved the reconstruction of the cloverleaf interchange between I-495 and I-278 in Queens. The intersection would be rebuilt and replaced over three years at a cost of $68 million. At that location, tight ramps and traffic lights would be replaced with a three-level grade-separated interchange, and a new double-decked highway would be built between Maurice Avenue and 48th Street. A ramp from the eastbound I-495 to I-278 opened in 1968. In 1970, work commenced on a two-year project to install a Jersey barrier in the median of I-495 from 108th Street to Little Neck Parkway. Previously, there was only a reservation separating opposing traffic. Plans to widen I-495 between I-278 and I-678 were announced by New York City mayor John Lindsay in 1968. The expressway would be expanded from three to five lanes in each direction between these two interchanges. In the 1970s, the federal government gave $270 million for the project. However, by 1978, the New York state government had retracted the interstate designation for that segment. The funds were split three ways for mass transit, highways, and improvements to the Long Island Expressway. The LIE was allocated $80 million to improve medians and widen shoulders. By the 1980s, the stretch of the LIE between I-278 and the Grand Central Parkway was frequently carrying 110% of its traffic capacity. In 1981, officials proposed several improvements for that highway segment, including adding a two-lane grade-separated service road between the two highways; realigning service roads at 69th and 108th Streets; and improving entrance and exit ramps. ====Lighting==== Initially, I-495 lacked proper lighting along its route in Nassau and Suffolk counties for many years. Because of this, during the night, motorists would be driving into complete darkness after crossing the Queens-Nassau border. Despite constant requests from Nassau local officials, no immediate plans were made until 1980, when the first streetlights were installed in eastern Nassau County. The state government planned to add about 1,425 lamps between the Queens-Nassau border and Nicolls Road (exit 62) since that segment of I-495 was heavily used. East of Nicolls Road, vehicle usage dropped sharply, so no lights were planned. The final streetlights were installed between exits 39 and 40 in 2002 in Nassau County. ==== HOV lanes ==== In 1988, as part of a proposed $3 billion bond issue, the New York state government proposed adding a fourth lane in each direction to I-495 between Jericho and Medford. After years of discussion, in 1991, the state approved the construction of the fourth lanes to I-495 east of the Cross Island Parkway; the additional lanes would be marked as high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV). The lanes were built in subsequent sections. The first section to open, a 12-mile section in western Suffolk County, was opened in May 1994. The lanes soon became well known due to a combination of advertising and free publicity in news articles, and they were heavily patronized even outside of peak hours. The lanes were completed on June 30, 2005, at which point they ran from exit 32 in eastern Queens to exit 64 at Medford in Suffolk County. Construction of the HOV lanes within Queens was delayed due to opposition from local officials and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. The HOV segment in Queens was later canceled altogether in 1998, when governor George Pataki announced that the additional lanes between exits 30 and 32 in Queens would be entrance and exit lanes, rather than HOV lanes. In addition, the HOV project would have rebuilt many bridges along I-495 between exits 33 and 40 in Nassau County. As a concession to homeowners, the HOV lanes were narrowed and built within the existing roadbed, and the bridges were largely kept as is. ====Interchange improvements==== Starting in 1998, I-495 was rebuilt between exit 15 (Van Dam Street) and exit 22 (Grand Central Parkway). The renovation cost $200 million and entailed renovating the highway's main and service roads; improving bridges; and replacing drains. The service roads for exit 19 were rebuilt between 74th Street and Queens Boulevard. There were also plans to rebuild westbound exit 16 to Greenpoint Avenue in Long Island City. The state announced a plan to renovate I-495 in the vicinity of Alley Pond Park and the Cross Island Parkway in 1995. In 2000, Pataki and New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani announced that this segment of I-495 between exits 29 and 32, near Alley Pond Park and the Cross Island Parkway, would be rebuilt at a cost of $112 million. The project was announced after the cancellation of the HOV lanes within Queens. Work started in August 2000 and was substantially completed by 2005. The project included the restoration of within the park, as well as the construction of new ramps to and from the Cross Island Parkway at exit 30. As part of the reconstruction, two cloverleaf ramps were replaced with flyovers; the shoulders in each direction were converted into travel lanes; the westbound exit 31 to Douglaston Parkway was closed; and new collector-distributor ramps were installed east of the Cross Island Parkway interchange. Starting in 2004, the NYSDOT examined proposals to reconfigure exit 22 with I-678 and the Grand Central Parkway in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. These included plans to construct direct ramps between the highways; relocating the service roads of I-495 so the mainline expressway could be widened; and rebuilding the at-grade junction between College Point Boulevard and Horace Harding Expressway. The interchange with Grand Central Parkway was rebuilt from spring 2015 to February 2018, with the replacement of the three overpasses carrying I-495 over the parkway. The $55 million reconstruction included extending merge lanes, replacing and adding lighting, and improving drainage structures. ===Service roads and proposed interchange=== As I-495 was being built across Long Island, it was specifically designed to accommodate certain topographical conditions and proposed interchanges. Exit 30 was originally a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Cross Island Parkway, while eastbound exit 30S was for Easthampton Boulevard with a connecting ramp to the southbound Cross Island Parkway. Exit 31 was originally a westbound only interchange for Douglaston Parkway; it was later combined with the exit for the Little Neck Parkway. Exit 39A was intended for the proposed extension of the Wantagh State Parkway near Powell Road in Old Westbury. It was intended to be a full Y interchange with an east-to-southbound-only off-ramp and a north-to-westbound-only on-ramp running beneath Powell Road. Exit 40 originally had only same-directional off-ramps under the expressway providing access to realigned sections of NY 25\\\\. When exit 41 was originally constructed, it had no south-to-west connecting ramp. Westbound access to the expressway was provided at the nearby exit 40 on-ramp at NY 25. An alternate design for exit 42 called for it to be similar to the one proposed for NY 135 and Bethpage State Parkway, and westbound exit 46 was originally a partial cloverleaf. Exit 47 was intended for the extension of the Bethpage State Parkway near Washington Avenue in Plainview. This was to be a partial cloverleaf with southbound-only off-ramps and northbound-only on-ramps in both directions. The west-to-southbound ramp would also have an additional connecting ramp to a two-way frontage road for a development and an industrial area near exit 46. The site of exit 47 is now a truck inspection site between exits 46 and 48, which opened in 2006. The original rights-of-way for the service roads between exits 48 and 49 were intended to weave around the steep Manetto Hills area of the main road, rather than running parallel to the road as it does today. The land between the service road and the main road was reserved for housing developments. The right-of-way for the original westbound service road still weaves through the development on the north side of the road. Exit 49 was originally a cloverleaf interchange with the outer ramps connecting to the service roads at a point closer to NY 110\\\\. This was in preparation for NY 110's formerly proposed upgrade into the Broad Hollow Expressway. After the project was canceled in the 1970s, the west-to- northbound on-ramp was moved to nearby CR 3 (Pinelawn Road), and the original ramp was replaced with a park and ride. Exit 52 (Commack Road/CR 4) was intended to be moved west to an interchange with the formerly proposed Babylon‚ÄìNorthport Expressway (realigned NY 231) in the vicinity of the two parking areas. These ramps would have been accessible from the service roads. The westbound off-ramp and service road at exit 54 (Wicks Road/CR 7) originally terminated at Long Island Motor Parkway, east of Wicks Road. The westbound on-ramp was squeezed between the northwest corner of the Wicks Road bridge and exit 53\\\\. Excessive weaving between exits 52, 53, and 54 caused NYSDOT to reconstruct all three interchanges into one, and replace the west- to-southbound off-ramp to Sagtikos State Parkway with a flyover ramp. Exit 55A was meant to be a trumpet interchange for the Hauppauge Spur of NY 347, between Long Island Motor Parkway (exit 55) and NY 111 (exit 56). The service roads were intended to go around the interchange, rather than run parallel to the main road. Ramps on the east side of Motor Parkway and west side of NY 111 would be eliminated as part of the interchange's construction. Between exits 57 and 58, there was a proposed extension of Northern State Parkway. Prior to the construction of the interchange with CR 97 (Nicolls Road), exit 62 was for Morris Avenue and Waverly Avenue eastbound, and Morris Avenue westbound.Aerial Photo by Lockwood, Kessler & Bartlett, Incorporated Consulting Engineers of Syosset, New York (Pre-1971 Nicolls Road) Between exits 63 and 64, the eastbound service road was intended to weave around a recharge basin and replace a local residential street. Residents would have lived on both sides of the service road, similar to the segment between exits 59 and 60.[1975 NYSDOT Map (but other evidence exists)] Exit 68 was originally planned to be built as a cloverleaf interchange without collective-distributor roads. Additionally in the 1970s, Suffolk County Department of Public Works proposed an extension of East Main Street in Yaphank (CR 102) that would have terminated at the west end of this interchange. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Suffolk County Planning Department considered extending CR 55 to the Grumman Calverton Naval Air Base between exits 70 and 71\\\\. This would have provided an additional interchange known as exit 70A. Exit 71 itself was intended to be a cloverleaf interchange with CR 94 (Nugent Drive) and the Hamptons Spur of the Long Island Expressway. After the Hamptons Spur proposal was cancelled, the plans for exit 71 were altered to call for a complete diamond interchange. ==Unbuilt expansions== ===Extensions of the expressway=== ==== Across Manhattan ==== Plans for I-495 called for it to extend across Manhattan on the Mid-Manhattan Expressway to the Lincoln Tunnel, which it would follow into New Jersey and connect to I-95 in Secaucus. The I-495 designation was assigned to the New Jersey approach to the tunnel in anticipation of the Mid-Manhattan Expressway being completed. However, the project was cancelled and the Mid- Manhattan Expressway was officially removed from I-495 on January 1, 1970. The New Jersey stretch of I-495 became New Jersey Route 495 in 1979.12th Avenue (NY 9A). This is one of the few remaining signs of the former I-495 to New Jersey.alt=left Manhattan Borough President Samuel Levy first proposed the Mid-Manhattan Expressway connector in 1936. The plan called for an expressway link crossing midtown Manhattan near 34th Street, then, as now, a heavily traveled crosstown surface street. The original idea was a pair of two-laned tunnels, the Mid-Manhattan Expressway or M.M.E. (sometimes called the Mid- Manhattan Elevated Expressway) connecting the West Side Highway on Hudson River and the Franklin D. Roosevelt East River Drive on the East River. By 1949, Robert Moses, New York City Parks Commissioner and Arterial Coordinator, proposed a six-lane elevated expressway along 30th Street. The expressway was to have two exits, to connect to the West Side Highway and the Lincoln Tunnel on the west side of Manhattan, and also to the Queens‚ÄìMidtown Tunnel and FDR Drive on the east side of the island. It would be constructed within a -wide right-of-way immediately south of 30th Street. The viaduct would require substantial demolition of high-rise buildings within Midtown Manhattan. To cover the costs of construction, Moses suggested charging tolls on the new roadway, which was estimated to cost $26 million to construct plus another $23 million for the land needed for the project. A later proposal had the roadway situated ten stories above valuable commercial real estate. Air rights above the expressway would be sold and new high-rise buildings would be constructed above the expressway; buildings would be constructed below the viaduct as well. One unusual variation involved running the roadway through the sixth and seventh floors of the Empire State Building. In 1963, plans for the expressway were finalized, and it received the I-495 designation. Beginning from its elevated connections to 12th Avenue (NY 9A) or the West Side Elevated Highway, the Mid-Manhattan Expressway would mostly follow 30th Street east of Ninth Avenue. The expressway would travel east as a six-lane elevated route, ten stories above the city streets to allow for commercial development both above and below the skyway deck. At Second Avenue, it would swing north for connections with the FDR Drive. Between First and Second Avenues, ramps would be constructed to provide access to the Queens-Midtown Tunnel.\\"Future Arterial Program for New York City\\", Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (1963). In December 1965, Moses canceled his plans for the Mid-Manhattan Expressway due to opposition from the city government, which wanted to build a crosstown tunnel instead. The Mid-Manhattan Expressway project was ultimately canceled and the I-495 designation removed from the expressway on January 1, 1970. In 1971, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller removed state plans for the Mid- Manhattan Expressway, along with about a dozen other highway plans including I-78 through New York City, of which another crosstown highway known as the Lower Manhattan Expressway (LOMEX) was part. ====Across Suffolk County==== Long Island, meanwhile, lobbied to extend I-495 east over NY 495\\\\. The extension took place in the early 1980s, at which time the NY 495 signs were taken down and I-495 was extended to the east end of the LIE. The section of I-495 in the vicinity of the Lincoln Tunnel was redesignated as NY 495 at this time. The extension of I-495 to Riverhead makes the highway a spur, which should have an odd first digit according to the Interstate Highway System's numbering scheme. Even first digits are usually assigned to bypasses, connectors, and beltways, as I-495 was prior to the 1980s. A proposed Long Island Crossing would have extended the LIE across Long Island Sound to I-95 in either Guilford, Connecticut, Old Saybrook, Connecticut, or Rhode Island via a series of existing and man-made islands, but a lack of funding as well as public opposition led to the demise of these proposals. CR 48 in Suffolk County was originally intended to become part of the North Fork extension of the Long Island Expressway. ===Subway line=== A New York City Subway line along the Long Island Expressway corridor had been proposed in the 1929 and 1939 IND Second System plans as an extension of the BMT Broadway Line east of the 60th Street Tunnel, prior to the construction of the expressway.Project for Expanded Rapid Transit Facilities, New York City Transit System, dated July 5, 1939 These were the predecessors to a line proposed in 1968 as part of the Program for Action. It would have split from the IND Queens Boulevard Line west of the Woodhaven Boulevard station and go to Kissena Boulevard via a right-of-way parallel and adjacent to the LIE. In Phase I, it would go to Kissena Boulevard at Queens College, and in Phase II, to Fresh Meadows and Bayside. This \\"Northeastern Queens\\" line would have been built in conjunction with the planned widening of the expressway. The subway tracks would have been placed under the expressway or its service roads, or in the median of a widened LIE in a similar manner to the Blue Line of the Chicago \\"L\\".Program for Action maps from thejoekorner.com It had been previously proposed to run the line from the 63rd Street tunnel under Northern Boulevard to Flushing (near the current Main Street station), then south under Kissena and Parsons Boulevards to meet with the LIE at Queens College. The LIE line was approved in July 1968. The line was opposed by many residents of the surrounding communities because it would entail widening I-495, which would necessitate the demolition of nearby homes. By 1973, the final design for the Northeast Queens LIE line was published. However, later that year, the LIE line was canceled because New York state voters had declined a $3.5 billion bond measure that would have paid for five subway extensions, including the LIE line. This was the second time that voters declined a bond issue to finance this extension, with the first being on November 2, 1971, for $2.5 billion. ==Exit list== ===Mid-Manhattan Expressway (canceled)=== If built, the Mid- Manhattan Expressway would have the following exits: ==See also== * 495 Productions - Reality show production company named for the highway * L.I.E. - 2001 film whose title is based on the initials of the highway ==References== ==External links== * Interstate 495 - New York (AARoads.com) * I-495 (Greater New York Roads) * Long Island's Official Online Community & LIE Relief Site * Long Island Expressway @ NYC Road Geek 95-4 New York Category:Expressways in New York City Category:History of transportation in New York City 4 New York 95-4 Category:Roads on Long Island *495 Category:Transportation in Manhattan Category:Transportation in Nassau County, New York Category:Transportation in Queens, New York Category:Transportation in Suffolk County, New York Category:Unfinished buildings and structures in the United States ","title":"Interstate 495 (New York)"},{"id":"844778","text":"The Roland CR-78 drum machine The Roland CompuRhythm CR-78 is a drum machine launched in 1978. Although primitive by later standards, the CR-78 represented an important advance in drum machine technology at the time, in particular by allowing users to program and store their own drum patterns. The wood effect cabinet and preset rhythms of the CR-78 such as Waltz, Bossa Nova and Rhumba suggest that it was seen by its designers as primarily an accompaniment for an electric organ, but the CR-78 became one of the favorite instruments of pop and electronic musicians in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was used by artists including Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Daryl Hall & John Oates, Blondie, Ultravox, Genesis, John Foxx, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Roxy Music, and Gary Numan. ==Operation== CR-78 Presets - upper row CR-78 Presets - lower row CR-78 Variation fill ins The CR-78 uses analog drum voices, which sound very little like real percussion instruments. The unit also incorporates an NEC microprocessor CPU (NEC) uPD8048C-015 8-bits to provide digital control of its functions. Previous Roland drum machines had offered only a selection of preset rhythms. The CR-78's key new feature at the time of its introduction was that in addition to offering 34 preset rhythms, it provided four programmable memory locations for storing patterns created by the user. These can be created by using step programming with the WS-1 box, which was available as an optional extra. The four user patterns are stored in RAM memory; when the CR78 is switched off, the contents of the RAM are maintained by a NiCd rechargeable battery. The CR-78's front panel allows the user to customize the preset rhythms by altering the volume balance between bass and treble sounds, canceling some sounds altogether, and adding \\"metallic beat\\" (three filtered square waves that create a distinctive chime timbre). Many of the preset rhythms have a memorable character, and the ability to manipulate them further made the CR-78 a versatile instrument. No digital control of tempo is provided on the front panel, with only an analog knob for tempo control. However, the CR-78 accepts an external V-trig clock, allowing a control voltage to be fed in from another device such as a music sequencer. A selection of preset fills and rhythm variations are also available, either to trigger manually, or automatically every 2, 4, 8 or 16 bars. Some of these fills were used in synth-pop songs such as \\"Enola Gay\\" by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and \\"Underpass\\" by John Foxx. Roland also produced a simpler drum machine, the CompuRhythm CR-68. This was essentially the same as the CR-78, but without programmable patterns or the ability to fade drum sounds in and out. A large cabinet version, the CompuRhythm CR-800, with capabilities between the CR-68 and CR-78, was also produced. At the same time Roland also sold the TR-66, a smaller unit which offered fewer preset rhythms and no programmability. == Sounds and rhythms == The CR-78's built-in rhythm sounds were a further development of those available on the earlier Roland Rhythm 33, 55 and 77 machines. The analog percussion voices consist of bass drum, snare drum, rim shot, hi-hat, cymbal, maracas, claves, cowbell, high bongo, low bongo, low conga, tambourine, guiro, and \\"metallic beat\\" (an accent that could be overlaid on the hi-hat voice). The CR-78 has an accent control, which increases the loudness of certain steps in a pattern. There are four patterns named \\"Rock\\" and two named \\"Disco\\". Other patterns are named \\"Waltz\\", \\"Shuffle\\", \\"Slow Rock\\", \\"Swing\\", \\"Foxtrot\\", \\"Tango\\", \\"Boogie\\", \\"Enka\\", \\"Bossa Nova\\", \\"Samba\\", \\"Mambo\\", \\"Chacha\\", \\"Beguine\\" and \\"Rhumba\\". Each pattern is available in two variations, labelled \\"A\\" and \\"B\\". It is possible to select more than one rhythm at a time, and also mute drum sounds from a pattern using the balance knob and dedicated cancel buttons. The CR-78 has been used in songs including \\"In the Air Tonight\\" by Phil Collins, \\"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)\\" by Daryl Hall & John Oates, \\"Mad World\\" by Tears For Fears, and in live performances by Radiohead. ==See also== *Boss Doctor Rhythm DR-110 *Linn LM-1 *Roland TR-808 ==References== ==External links== * Roland CompuRhythm CR-78 Demo (YouTube video) * Classic Roland CR-78 eighties tracks part 1: Hall&Oates;, Gary Numan, OMD, Soft Cell, Phil Collins (by Harlem Nights Music) * Classic Roland CR-78 eighties tracks part 2: Blondie, Visage, Roxy Music, John Foxx, Buggles (by Harlem Nights Music) * Polynominal.com CR78 resources: manual, schematics and audio demo Category:Drum machines Category:Japanese inventions Category:Japanese musical instruments Category:Products introduced in 1978 CR-78 CR-78 Category:Musical instruments invented in the 1970s ","title":"Roland CR-78"},{"id":"844782","text":"Markku Uusipaavalniemi (born 23 November 1966 in Karkkila) is a Finnish curler and former politician. ==Curling career== Uusipaavalniemi was the skip of Team Finland for the first time in the mid-1990s. Most (but not all) of Finland's curling medals have been achieved with Uusipaavalniemi as skip. Uusipaavalniemi's team won the European championship in 2000. He is also a two-time World Curling Championships bronze medalist (1998 and 2000) and two- time European Curling Championships bronze medalist (1999 and 2001). Uusipaavalniemi's Finland team disappointingly finished fifth at the 2002 Olympic tournament. Markku Uusipaavalniemi at Oulunkyl√§ Curling Hall In 2004, he and his somewhat altered Finland line-up pulled off the daunting task of securing qualification for the 2005 Ford World Men's Curling Championships from the 'B' competition at the European championships, where they languished following the country's relegation the previous season. To do this, they had to win the competition outright, and then overcome Russia in an additional play-off match. At the 2005 World Championship, Uusipaavalniemi's team finished the round-robin tied for first place with five other teams on an 8‚Äì3 record. In the tie-breakers however, they were knocked out of contention by Canada's Randy Ferbey. Also in 2005, Uusipaavalniemi won the first ever European Mixed Curling Championship with teammates Kirsi Nyk√§nen, Teemu Salo and Tiina Kautonen in Andorra. Uusipaavalniemi's Finland team finished the round-robin at the 2006 Olympic tournament in first place, with a 7‚Äì2 record. They beat Great Britain 4‚Äì3 in the semi-final, with the last stone of the final end ‚Äî thrown by Uusipaavalniemi ‚Äî giving the Finns the deciding point. Finland lost the final to Canada 10-4 taking the silver medal. Two weeks before the start of the 2006 World Men's Curling Championship in Lowell, Massachusetts, Uusipaavalniemi suffered a wrist injury that forced him to miss the team's first three games of the competition. He recovered enough to start playing in the fourth game, where he skipped and threw second rocks. He played out the rest of the competition throwing third rocks, but Finland did not make the playoff round, finishing tied for fifth with a 6‚Äì5 record. Uusipaavalniemi returned to the 2007 Ford World Men's Curling Championship but his team got off to a rough start, losing their first two games and stringing together back-to-back wins only twice. Finland qualified for a tiebreaker with a 6‚Äì5 record, but lost to Germany 8-5 and finished sixth. Markku admitted that his recent campaign for (and eventual election to) Finnish parliament had forced him to cut back on curling practice time, perhaps contributing to the team's early struggles. After the 2007 World Championships Uusipaavalniemi didn't play at a competitive level until he returned to curling in the 2009‚Äì10 season with a new team. The new team won the Finnish Championship in the 2010‚Äì11 curling season and represented Finland in 2011 European Curling Championships. The appearance in the 2011 Europeans was a disappointment when Finland finished 7th in the B-group. ==Political career== On 20 September 2006 Uusipaavalniemi announced his candidacy for Finnish parliament in the 2007 election for the Centre Party.. Uusipaavalniemi was elected along with three other members of his party from the Uusimaa constituency. He voted against the further privatization of government owned companies as well as against the Lisbon treaty, both of which were supported by the party. On 11 November 2010 Uusipaavalniemi defected from the Centre Party and joined the ranks of the True Finns Party.http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/11/mp_defects_conservatives_take_top_spot_2134311.html He was not reelected in the 2011 election. ==Personal life== Uusipaavalniemi lives in Helsinki. He is divorced and has three children. His older brother Jussi taught him how to curl. ==Awards== * Colin Campbell Award: 1998, 2003 * Markku of the Year, 2002.

For an algebraic structure of a given signature, this may be expressed by curtailing the signature: the new signature is an edited form of the old one. If the signature is left as an empty list, the functor is simply to take the underlying set of a structure. Because many structures in mathematics consist of a set with an additional added structure, a forgetful functor that maps to the underlying set is the most common case. ==Overview== As an example, there are several forgetful functors from the category of commutative rings. A (unital) ring, described in the language of universal algebra, is an ordered tuple (R, +, √ó, a, 0, 1) satisfying certain axioms, where \\"+\\" and \\"√ó\\" are binary functions on the set R, a is a unary operation corresponding to additive inverse, and 0 and 1 are nullary operations giving the identities of the two binary operations. Deleting the 1 gives a forgetful functor to the category of rings without unit; it simply \\"forgets\\" the unit. Deleting \\"√ó\\" and 1 yields a functor to the category of abelian groups, which assigns to each ring R the underlying additive abelian group of R. To each morphism of rings is assigned the same function considered merely as a morphism of addition between the underlying groups. Deleting all the operations gives the functor to the underlying set R. It is beneficial to distinguish between forgetful functors that \\"forget structure\\" versus those that \\"forget properties\\". For example, in the above example of commutative rings, in addition to those functors that delete some of the operations, there are functors that forget some of the axioms. There is a functor from the category CRing to Ring that forgets the axiom of commutativity, but keeps all the operations. Occasionally the object may include extra sets not defined strictly in terms of the underlying set (in this case, which part to consider the underlying set is a matter of taste, though this is rarely ambiguous in practice). For these objects, there are forgetful functors that forget the extra sets that are more general. Most common objects studied in mathematics are constructed as underlying sets along with extra sets of structure on those sets (operations on the underlying set, privileged subsets of the underlying set, etc.) which may satisfy some axioms. For these objects, a commonly considered forgetful functor is as follows. Let \\\\mathcal{C} be any category based on sets, e.g. groups‚Äîsets of elements‚Äîor topological spaces‚Äîsets of 'points'. As usual, write \\\\operatorname{Ob}(\\\\mathcal{C}) for the objects of \\\\mathcal{C} and write \\\\operatorname{Fl}(\\\\mathcal{C}) for the morphisms of the same. Consider the rule: :For all A in \\\\operatorname{Ob}(\\\\mathcal{C}), A\\\\mapsto A= the underlying set of A, :For all u in \\\\operatorname{Fl}(\\\\mathcal{C}), u\\\\mapsto u= the morphism, u, as a map of sets. The functor \\\\cdot is then the forgetful functor from \\\\mathcal{C} to Set, the category of sets. Forgetful functors are almost always faithful. Concrete categories have forgetful functors to the category of sets‚Äîindeed they may be defined as those categories that admit a faithful functor to that category. Forgetful functors that only forget axioms are always fully faithful, since every morphism that respects the structure between objects that satisfy the axioms automatically also respects the axioms. Forgetful functors that forget structures need not be full; some morphisms don't respect the structure. These functors are still faithful however because distinct morphisms that do respect the structure are still distinct when the structure is forgotten. Functors that forget the extra sets need not be faithful, since distinct morphisms respecting the structure of those extra sets may be indistinguishable on the underlying set. In the language of formal logic, a functor of the first kind removes axioms, a functor of the second kind removes predicates, and a functor of the third kind remove types. An example of the first kind is the forgetful functor Ab ‚Üí Grp. One of the second kind is the forgetful functor Ab ‚Üí Set. A functor of the third kind is the functor Mod ‚Üí Ab, where Mod is the fibred category of all modules over arbitrary rings. To see this, just choose a ring homomorphism between the underlying rings that does not change the ring action. Under the forgetful functor, this morphism yields the identity. Note that an object in Mod is a tuple, which includes a ring and an abelian group, so which to forget is a matter of taste. == Left adjoints of forgetful functors == Forgetful functors tend to have left adjoints, which are 'free' constructions. For example: * free module: the forgetful functor from \\\\mathbf{Mod}(R) (the category of R-modules) to \\\\mathbf{Set} has left adjoint \\\\operatorname{Free}_R, with X\\\\mapsto \\\\operatorname{Free}_R(X), the free R-module with basis X. * free group * free lattice * tensor algebra * free category, adjoint to the forgetful functor from categories to quivers * universal enveloping algebra For a more extensive list, see (Mac Lane 1997). As this is a fundamental example of adjoints, we spell it out: adjointness means that given a set X and an object (say, an R-module) M, maps of sets X \\\\to M correspond to maps of modules \\\\operatorname{Free}_R(X) \\\\to M: every map of sets yields a map of modules, and every map of modules comes from a map of sets. In the case of vector spaces, this is summarized as: \\"A map between vector spaces is determined by where it sends a basis, and a basis can be mapped to anything.\\" Symbolically: :\\\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\\\mathbf{Mod}_R}(\\\\operatorname{Free}_R(X),M) = \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\\\mathbf{Set}}(X,\\\\operatorname{Forget}(M)). The unit of the free‚Äìforgetful adjunction is the \\"inclusion of a basis\\": X \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Free}_R(X). Fld, the category of fields, furnishes an example of a forgetful functor with no adjoint. There is no field satisfying a free universal property for a given set. == See also == * Adjoint functors * Functors == References == * Mac Lane, Saunders.

In the United States, these donations can provide a tax benefit. ==In the United States== Some critics have claimed that car donations are essentially a tax shelter. However, non- profit organizations in the US have come to rely increasingly upon the revenue from car donations. This type of donation has become increasingly widespread; in 2000, 733,000 U.S. taxpayers reduced their taxes by $654 million. ===Tax considerations=== Although advertised as an easy way to dispose of an old car, donors need to fulfill certain post-donation requirements to qualify for the tax deduction,Internal Revenue Service Publication 4303, A Donor's Guide to Vehicle Donations such as obtaining a written acknowledgment of the car's subsequent sale by the charity, and itemizing tax returns instead of taking the standard deduction. For vehicles valued at less than $500, the deduction amount comes from the donor's own estimate of the car's value, even if the charity receives less money from its sale. Deductions greater than $500 are limited to the proceeds of selling the vehicle, usually at auction. The U.S Internal Revenue Service advises that starting in 2005: ==In the United Kingdom== Car donation schemes in the UK are slightly different from those operating in the United States and only established themselves as a valued source of income for UK charities in January 2010, led by Giveacar ‚Äì a non- profit organisation.https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/dec/14/giveacar- scraps-sells-cars-for-charity Operating as a non-profit organisation allows charities to avoid the large overheads created by profit-making car donation companies. In addition, whereas car donation in the US has been incentivised through tax breaks, in the UK there are no such tax benefits to donating your car. ==Practices== Vehicle donations in America are operated in a wide variety of plans, ranging from highly organized and professional-grade not-for-profit, national, or local charities to scrap yards, haulers, tow-truck companies and salvagers who establish programs that may support a charity. According to Charity Navigator, the guidance of the rating agencies concerning car donation programs, where the charity receives a flat fee for the use of their name by a third party, versus program management by a third party,there are some questionable companies who contract to use a nonprofit's agencies name and logo to raise funds and then just give them a flat fee unrelated to income or performance. This is frowned upon by rating agencies and the government. However, a percentage return program is viewed positively if the nonprofit receives more than 50% of the generated income. Programs that engage a third party, but with a \\"cost maximum cap\\" involved, such as with national charities like the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, performance in this area is exemplary, with 70-80% on average being returned to the nonprofit. ==Benefit to charities== Many charities run donation programs which accept car donations, such as Goodwill, Salvation Army and even the American Cancer Society. Many charities will use your car donation directly to transport volunteers and supplies to areas that need help. Some even have their own car lots which sell the donated cars but many have their donations processed through auto auction companies. Many processing companies also collect and sell donated cars and distribute the money to a charity the donor indicates. The processing company typically takes a percentage of the sale value of the car, but these programs allow charities without their own facilities or staff dedicated to fund raising to benefit from vehicle donation programs. Ideally, donors should also investigate how much money from the sale of the car goes to the auction processor and how much actually benefits the charity's programs, as opposed to its administrative overhead. ==ReferencesTax deductions Category:Donation Category:Charity Category:Taxation in the United States ","title":"Car donation"},{"id":"844794","text":"Bihar Vikas Party (Bihar Development Party), political party in the Indian state of Bihar.

Museology or museum studies is the study of museums. It explores the history of museums and their role in society, as well as the activities they engage in, including curating, preservation, public programming, and education. == Terminology == The words that are used to describe the study of museums vary depending on language and geography. For example, while ‚Äúmuseology‚Äù is becoming more prevalent in English, it is most commonly used to refer to the study of museums in French (mus√©ologie), Spanish (museolog√≠a), German (Museologie), Italian (museologia), and Portuguese (museologia) ‚Äì while English speakers more often use the term ‚Äúmuseum studies‚Äù to refer to that same field of study. When referring to the day-to-day operations of museums, other European languages typically use derivatives of the Latin ‚Äúmuseographia‚Äù (French: mus√©ographie, Spanish: museograf√≠a, German: Museographie, Italian: museografia, Portuguese: museografia), while English speakers typically use the term ‚Äúmuseum practice‚Äù or ‚Äúoperational museology‚Äù == Development of the field == The development of museology in Europe coincided with the emergence of early collectors and cabinets of curiosity in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. In particular, during The Age of Enlightenment anthropologists, naturalists, and hobbyist collectors encouraged the growth of public museums that displayed natural history and ethnographic objects and art in North America and Europe. In the 18th and 19th centuries, European powers‚Äô colonization of overseas lands was accompanied by the development of the disciplines of natural history and ethnography, and the rise of private and institutional collection building. In many cases museums became the holding places for collections that were acquired through colonial conquests, which positioned museums as key institutions in Western European colonial projects. In the 19th century, European museology was focused on framing museums as institutions that would educate and ‚Äúcivilize‚Äù the general public. Museums typically served nationalist interests, and their primary purpose was often to celebrate the state, country, or colonial power. Though World‚Äôs Fairs, such as The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London or the Chicago World‚Äôs Fair, were temporary, they were some of the first examples of large- scale exhibition spaces dedicated to nationalist agendas; both Britain and America wanted to assert themselves as international leaders in science and industry. In some cases world's fairs became the basis for museums. For instance, The Field Museum in Chicago grew out of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. Museums Association, the first professional membership organization for those working in the museum field, was established in London in 1889. In 1901, they developed Museums Journal, the first publication devoted entirely to the theory and practice of museums, and soon after other magazines appeared, like Museumskunde in Germany (1905) and the American Association of Museum‚Äôs Museum Work in the United States (1919). With the creation of the International Council of Museums (ICOM) in 1946, the study of museums gained increasing momentum and exposure, though at the time most of the scholarly focus was on operational museology, or museum practice. Beginning in the 1950s, new forms of museology were emerging as a way to revitalize the educational role of museums. One attempt to re-envision museums‚Äô role was the concept of Ecomuseums, first proposed publicly at ICOM‚Äôs 9th International Conference in France (1971). Ecomuseums proliferated in Europe ‚Äì and still exist around the world today ‚Äì challenging traditional museums and dominant museum narratives, with an explicit focus on community control and the development of both heritage and sustainability. In 1988, Robert Lumley‚Äôs book The Museum Time Machine ‚Äúexpressed the growing disquiet about traditional museological presuppositions and operations‚Äù. The following year, Peter Vergo published his critically acclaimed edited collection The New Museology (1989/1997), a work that aimed to challenge the traditional or ‚Äúold‚Äù field of museology, and was named one of the Paperbacks of the Year by The Sunday Times in Britain. Around the same time, Ivan Karp co-organized two ground-breaking conferences at the Smithsonian, Exhibiting Cultures (1988) and Museums and Communities (1990), that soon resulted in highly influential volumes of the same names that redefined museums studies. Scholars who are engaged in various ‚Äúnew‚Äù museological practices sometimes disagree about when this trend ‚Äúofficially‚Äù began, what exactly it encompasses, and whether or not it is an ongoing field of study. However, the common thread of New Museology is that it has always involved some form of ‚Äúradical reassessment of the roles of museums within society‚Äù. Critical theorists like Michel Foucault, Walter Benjamin, and Benedict Anderson also had a profound influence on late 20th and early 21st century museology. As other disciplines began to be critically reassessed, often adding the term ‚Äúcritical‚Äù to their new titles (i.e. critical race theory), a discourse of critical museology also emerged, intensifying around the turn of the 21st century. It arose from a similar critical discourse as New Museology and shares many of its features, so much so that many scholars disagree about the extent to which you can distinguish one from the other. In other words, while some scholars say that New Museology was a watershed moment in the late 20th century and critical museology is a related but separate movement in the early 21st century, others argue that New Museology is an ongoing field of study that has many manifestations and names, one of which is critical museology The latest movements in museology tend to focus on museums being interdisciplinary, multi-vocal, accessible, and open to criticism. While these critical discourses dominate contemporary museology, there are many different kinds of museums that exist today, some are engaged in new and innovative practices, and others are more traditional and therefore, less critical. == Operational museology == Operational museology refers to the day-to-day operations of a museum, including its organizational and regulatory structures, institutional policies and protocols (procedural, ethical, etc.), collections management (including conservation and restoration), and its exhibitions and programs. While there has been much scholarship around operational museology over the last 30 years, some scholars argue that it has lacked sustained analysis. Scholarship concerning operational museology has also overlapped with critical museology and other developments in the field. === Public role of museums === Operational museology has shifted in the late 20th and 21st century to position the museum as a central institution that serves the public by informing culture, history, and art while creating space for challenging conversations. Museums are thus perceived as cultural communicators that can reconstruct and reconnect cultural memory to the viewing public by collecting, preserving, documenting, and interpreting material culture. For example, many history museums engage with public memory from a multi-vocal perspective and present critical narratives regarding current sociopolitical issues. Other history museums, however, keep nationalistic approaches pertaining to the 19th century.. p. 51 Some museums convey reflexive and critical narratives, while others enact as \\"mass mediums\\" oriented toward international tourist networks. These institutions tend to display spectacular exhibition designs and grant little space for complex narratives and critical messages.. p. 50 Scholars have identified a recent transformation in the way museums define their functions and produce their programming strategies as these have become spaces for encounters and meaningful experiences. For instance, in The Metamorphosis of the Museal: From Exhibitionary to Experiential Complex and Beyond, Andreas Huyssen observes the museum, formerly conceived as \\"a container of the past and its accumulated objects‚Äù is now conceived as ‚Äúa site of activity and experience in and for an ever-expanding present.‚Äù ==Critical Museology== === Overview of the field === Critical museology has emerged as a key discourse in contemporary museology. It is a broad field of study that engages critically with museums, calling into question the foundation assumptions of the field. This demonstrates critical museology‚Äôs close connection to New Museology, which also challenges foundational assumptions in museology. Critical museology may also extend beyond the traditional museum to include cultural centres, heritage sites, memorials, art galleries, and so on. === Development of the field === Given that museums are historically linked to colonialism, imperialism, and European missionary work, they have a morally and politically problematic past. While some of the objects museums hold were purchased ‚Äì though not always fairly and often to the exclusive benefit of the collector ‚Äì a large proportion of museum collections were taken as spoils of war, or otherwise removed without the consent of the people or community that owned them. Museums, along with their collections ‚Äì and collectors ‚Äì played a key role in establishing and reiterating the dominance of colonial Europe and narratives of cultural superiority. Critical museology was developed through questioning the foundational assumptions of museum studies and museums, including their history, architecture, display, programming, and the provenance of their objects. Recent work has also analyzed exhibition design to show how the diverse media combined in exhibitions communicate and shape visitors' interpretations and values. While anthropologists and the field of anthropology were actively engaged in problematic collecting practices for two centuries, anthropologists have also been central to the emergence of critical museology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This has included reconstructing and analyzing those collection histories and the relationships that grew around them, as in the Pitt Rivers Museum's \\"Relational Museum\\" project. They have also led interdisciplinary working groups that developed new approaches to globalizing processes in critical museology, as foregrounded in Museum Frictions, a third innovative volume co-edited by Ivan Karp. Additionally, anthropologists have spearheaded recent methodological and pedagogical developments in critical museology including ‚Äúcuratorial dreaming‚Äù, curating labs like the Making Culture Lab at Simon Fraser University, the Curating and Public Scholarship Lab at Concordia University, and the Centre for Anthropological Research on Museums and Heritage (CARMAH) in Berlin, as well as courses like the International Field School in Critical Museology. In other contexts, historians have been at the forefront of interventions in critical museology. === Decolonizing and indigenizing museums === In North America, Australia, and New Zealand in particular, critical museology attempts to address the problematic colonial pasts of museums through the decolonization and Indigenization of museums. Once viewed as the formal process of handing over the instruments of government, decolonizing is now recognized ‚Äì particularly in Canada ‚Äì as a long-term process that involves dismantling the bureaucratic, cultural, linguistic, and psychological legacies of colonial power While there is no agreed upon end-goal of decolonization, the process of decolonizing the museum is aimed at ‚Äúassist[ing] communities in their efforts to address the legacies of historical unresolved grief by speaking the hard truths of colonialism and thereby creating spaces for healing and understanding‚Äù. Collaboration, consultation, and repatriation are key components of decolonizing museums. Australian museums have been leaders in developing repatriation processes, consultation, and collaboration with Indigenous communities, beginning in the late 1980s. Projects involving collaboration and consultation with source communities have taken many forms, ranging from developing traveling exhibits, revising collection catalogues, to establishing community cultural centers and working with photographic collections together. In Canada, collaboration and consultation were first formally suggested by the 1994 Task Force Report on Museums and First Peoples, and are now seen by many museums as being an essential practice for any institution that holds collections belonging to Indigenous peoples. In North America, and around the world, some of the objects in those collections ‚Äì particularly sacred objects or human remains ‚Äì have been repatriated or returned to their communities of origin. The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (1990) formalized the process of repatriating Indigenous cultural objects in the United States. While Canada does not have a formal policy around repatriation, many museums have their own internal policies and many objects have been returned to Indigenous communities that way. Though repatriation policies are typically well intended, the process has often been complicated by institutional, community, and government politics, and have had varying degrees of success. A newer concept, the Indigenization of museums, moves away from focusing exclusively on collaborative methods and towards employing Indigenous people to work in positions of power within museums as a means of opening up the museum to sustained Indigenous influences, and restructuring the museum to reflect Indigenous approaches to knowledge sharing. Examples of indigenizing museum practice include Art Gallery of Ontario's 2016 appointing of Wanda Nanibush as the Curator of Canadian and Indigenous Art, Wood Land School‚Äôs takeover of the SBC Gallery of Contemporary Art in Montreal, the appointment of Aboriginal curators at the South Australia Museum, the Australian Museum, the National Museum of Australia, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia, and the creation of the Reciprocal Research Network, which is an interactive online resource co-developed by the Musqueam Indian Band, the Sto:lo Nation Tribal Council, the U‚Äômista Cultural Centre, and the Museum of Anthropology at UBC, to facilitate collaborative research and knowledge exchange between communities, scholars, and cultural institutions in Canada and internationally. While there is no linear trajectory of decolonizing/Indigenizing work in museums, major milestones in Canada include the Indians of Canada Pavilion at Expo 67‚Äô; The Lubicon Cree‚Äôs boycott of The Spirit Sings, a Shell sponsored exhibition at the Glenbow Museum in 1988, and the resulting Task Force Report on Museums and First Peoples in 1994; and The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada‚Äôs 2015 final report, with Calls to Action that specifically address museums and archives. == New methodologies == ===Vienna Method=== The Vienna Method, subsequently called ISOTYPES was developed by the Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum (Museum for Social and Economic Affairs), Vienna. With the support of Otto Gl√∂ckel of the Vienna City Council the Museum sought to make sociological and economic information accessible to the whole population regardless of their level of education. === Museum interventions === Interventions in museums were first employed by artists like Marcel Duchamp, who were looking to challenge both established elite art traditions and the expectations of museum visitors. By the late 20th century, interventions had become a methodology used not only by artists, but also by other groups ‚Äì including activists, museum visitors, and even museums themselves ‚Äì as a way to democratize exhibitions, challenge dominant narratives, problematize the provenance of museum objects, and so on. ==== Artist interventions ==== A central aspect of Institutional Critique, some artist‚Äôs interventions have been co-organized or commissioned by museums themselves ‚Äì like Fred Wilson‚Äôs Mining the Museum (1992) at the Maryland Historical Society, Michael Nicholl Yahgulanaas‚Äô Meddling in the Museum (2007) at UBC‚Äôs Museum of Anthropology, or the Artists' Interventions at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford ‚Äì while others have been done without explicit permission, like Andrea Fraser‚Äôs Museum Highlights (1989) at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. One of the best known artist interventions in a museum is James Luna‚Äôs Artifact Piece, which was first performed at the San Diego Museum of Man in 1987, and then again at The Decade Show in New York in 1990. Luna, a Luise√±o artist, lay almost naked in a display case filled with artifacts in order to challenge representations of Indigenous peoples in museums and the narratives that accompanied those representations, which suggested that Indigenous people and cultures were dead. The objects in the case included Luna's favorite books and music, his divorce papers, his university degree, photos, and other mementos, alongside labels describing the scars on his body and how he had acquired them. The work was critically acclaimed for its challenge of conventional narratives of Indigeneity and Indigenous experience. A few years later, two artists ‚Äì Guillermo G√≥mez-Pe√±a and Coco Fusco ‚Äì developed a traveling performance art piece called The Couple in the Cage: Two Amerindiens Visit the West that reflected on the treatment and representation of Indigenous peoples in colonial contexts, and was performed in many different spaces, including Covent Gardens, the Walker Art Center, the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, the Australia Museum, and the Field Museum. ==== Activist interventions ==== While there is overlap between artist and activist interventions, specific activist groups such as the Guerrilla Girls have long been creating exhibitions and public advertisements ‚Äì through the use of billboards, stickers, posters, and projections ‚Äì to critique power dynamics related to sexism, racism, and class privilege in museums. There is also a tradition of activist interventions being used as responses to the censorship of exhibited artworks. In 1989, after the Corcoran Gallery of Art cancelled The Perfect Moment, an exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe‚Äôs explicit photography, protesters projected Mapplethorpe‚Äôs photos on the exterior of the museum. Similar protests occurred when David Wojnarowicz‚Äôs film A Fire in My Belly was removed from the Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture exhibit at the National Portrait Gallery in 2010. ==== Internal institutional interventions ==== While most interventions are directed at museums from outside sources, museums also engage interventions as a way of performing self-critique. For example, in 2015 MoMA mounted a meta- intervention exhibit called Messing with MoMA: Critical Interventions at the Museum of Modern Art 1939 ‚Äì Now. In a similar way, ethnographic exhibitions have been incorporating contemporary art as a way to disrupt conventional expectations and narratives. Another critical intervention in museums is the conception of permanent exhibitions (long-lasting galleries presenting the museum collections) that critically reveal and approach the connections between the institution ‚Äî its history and practices ‚Äî and the cultural and social context in which the institution is embedded. This practice seeks to highlight the transformations in the paradigms that have determined the messages and languages of museums in the past, and invites visitors to reflect on the diverse roles of museums through history. The display of the collections of the Museum of Antioquia (Medell√≠n, Colombia) exemplifies this practice. The design of the gallery Historias para re-pensar (Histories to re- think) focuses on the 19th century and first half of the 20th century, and proposes a critical review of the region‚Äôs art history thereby inquiring about the role of collectors and the Museum in the construction of aesthetic paradigms. The gallery includes contemporary works in order to install a dialogue between the past and the present. Additionally, the section of the permanent exhibition titled Galleries for decolonial dialogues: The persistence of the dogma displays an anachronistic array of works and documents in order to convey how enduring colonial dogmas determined the country‚Äôs cultural values and visual experiences during the 19th century. The project of redeveloping the Museum‚Äôs permanent galleries is part of a larger institutional transformation that makes the Museum of Antioquia a great example of comprehensive critical museology practices. Another example of this Museum‚Äôs critical approach is the artistic residency project of artist Nadia Granados who, with curator Carolina Chac√≥n and a group of sex workers based in downtown Medell√≠n, developed in 2017 the award-winning cabaret/performance Nadie sabe qui√©n soy yo (No one knows who I am). From then on, the performers funded the group Las Guerreras del Centro, a collective to highlight the lives and stories of sex workers through artistic performances, knitting circles and other community actions. Nadie sabe qui√©n soy yo was the beginning of a series of curatorial and educational collaborations between Las Guerreras del Centro and the Museum of Antioquia. Such collaborative projects are destigmatizing and empowering critical museology practices that generate new spaces for exchanges and social dialogues. These spaces emerge from the museum, forge links beyond museum walls, and drastically transform the museum‚Äôs relationship with its social environment. Another example of a museum presenting a critical review of messages conveyed by the institution in the past can be found in the Royal Ontario Museum permanent exhibition, specifically in its Canadian history galleries. In this case, ROM curators have repurposed old dioramas as a way to reflect critically on past uses of dioramas to portray indigenous people‚Äôs cultures. The new ironic diorama questions this common practice in museums and points out the stereotypes such practices promoted in the past (e.g., the depiction of indigenous peoples as belonging to another time or somehow as primitive or extinguished cultures). === Curatorial dreaming === Curatorial Dreaming was originally developed as a challenge to museum critics, who are typically not expected to provide practical solutions to the issues they identify in the exhibits they critique, to develop their own imagined exhibitions. It is intended as ‚Äúan alternative mode of critical, intellectual practice ‚Äì a form of ‚Äòtheorizing in the concrete‚Äô‚Äù. === Curating workshops, courses and labs === Over the last three decades there has been a proliferation of curating workshops, courses, and labs that engage with New Museology and critical museology in museum spaces, in universities, and elsewhere. For instance, the Bard Center for Curatorial Studies in New York was founded in 1990 and began offering a graduate program in 1994. In Germany, the Centre for Anthropological Research on Museums and Heritage is engaging with the social, cultural, and political issues facing contemporary museums. In Canada, two of the most innovative curating labs are the Making Culture Lab at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver and the Curating and Public Scholarship Lab at Concordia University in Montreal, which offered its inaugural International Field School in Critical Museology in May 2017. The African Programme in Museum and Heritage Studies in Cape Town includes a curatorial module within a comprehensive diploma and M.A. program that engages critically with museum and heritage studies, the leading program on the continent. == See also == * Museum education * Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage * Museum anthropology * Natural history museum * World's fair ==References== ==Bibliography== * Assembly of First Nations & Canadian Museums Association.

It is located in the village of Avaldsnes on the northern part of the island of Karm√∏y. It is the church for the Avaldsnes parish which is part of the Karm√∏y prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Stavanger. The medieval stone church was built in a long church design by an unknown architect. The first church located here was likely built before the year 1024 on the site of Avaldsnes Kongsg√•rd estate. The present stone church was built in 1250. The church seats about 400 people. ==History== Ruined Church at Avaldsnes at Karm√∏y, Johan Christian Dahl (1820) Before this church was constructed, there was a wooden church on the same site around the year 1024. That church is assumed to have been built by Olav Trygvason, and it is possible that the present stone church is built around this church originally. The church was mentioned by the historian Snorri Sturluson in chapter 19 of his book Soga om Olav den heilage. This church has been a landmark for seafarers passing through the Karmsundet strait for 750 years. King H√•kon IV H√•konsson gave permission to replace the old wooden church with a stone church around the year 1250. The new stone building was not completed until nearly 1320, and was then the fourth largest in the country. The church was dedicated to St. Olav and received the status of \\"Royal Chapel\\". During the same period it became one of four \\"college-churches\\" (it appointed a council of theological and juridical scholars). Probably there was a group of four scholars and teachers in law and theology. The stone church had a rectangular nave and narrower, rectangular chancel as well as a large tower to the west. There was an octagonal stone room located to the south of the quire. This octagonal room was a chapter house (kapittelhus). These rooms were common for English cathedrals and they were used for large group meetings. This room is assumed to have been referenced in 1599 by clergyman and historical writer Peder Clauss√∏n Friis (1545‚Äì1614). Remaining walls for this room were visible as late as 1840, but are now completely gone. Decay started with the Black Death in 1349‚Äì1351. This disaster was followed by 400 years of Danish supremacy. In this period, the church gradually fell into a state of ruin due to lack of repair. By 1599, the quire was the only room left in the old church that was still usable. During the 17th century, a little wooden church was built inside the stone walls and this was used for more than 200 years. The first restoration work began in 1830. The old steeple was demolished, the nave was rebuilt, and a small wooden steeple was erected on the top. In the 1920s the church was once again restored in a manner which was more similar to its original architecture. A new stone steeple was built and the interior renewed. The German occupation in World War II became dramatic for the church. German officials asserted that the high steeple was used as a landmark for Allied planes, coming in over the strait of Karmsund to drop bombs in the water. German authorities demanded the steeple be demolished. Many people were engaged in the task of saving it, and they persuaded the German military to let them camouflage the whole church with timber. This was to be done in 5 weeks, but the whole job lasted a year. The front of the church bears a couple of bullet holes. The stained glass windows were ordered for the 700th anniversary in 1950. They were the creation of by Norwegian artist Bernhard Greve (1886-1962) from Lofthus who worked mainly with stained glass, fresco, and ceramic sculpture. The windows protrayed important events in the life of Christ: baptism, passion, ascension, and resurrection. The altar, baptismal font, and pulpit were designed in the 1920s by Norwegian functionalist architect Eivind Moestue (1893-1977). The baptismal basin dates back to the 16th century. ==Design and architecture== The pointed arches, but thick walls and no pillars, suggest an early Gothic design. The walls are composed of ordinary gray stone in thickness about . The corners and frames around the doors and windows are of steatite (soapstone) from Tolgetj√∏nn near Haugesund. ==Mary's Needle== Mary's Needle () is the only one remaining of several monumental stones which once stood around the church area. The stone has been somewhat taller, but, towering at it is still the second largest of its kind in Norway. The stone leans in towards the church wall--the distance to the wall is in fact only . ==Media gallery== Norway Avaldsnes church overview.JPGView of the church Avaldsnes-Jungfrau Maria Nahnadel.jpgView of Mary's needle ChristenSchaaning.jpgA 1663 painting of Christen Bentsen Schaaning by Scottish painter Andrew Smith P1150962 Avaldsnes kirke gotisk portal.JPGMain doors to the church Avaldsnes kirke, Rogaland - Riksantikvaren-T237 01 0017.jpgHistoric view of the church with the old tower No-nb digibok 2014091028002 0029 1.jpgPainting of the church before its 19th- century renovations ==List of priests== Note: this list is not entirely complete, additionally medieval priests are only sporadically known. ==See also== *List of churches in Rogaland ==References== ==External links== * Avaldsnes: Norway's oldest throne * Picture gallery Category:Karm√∏y Category:Churches in Rogaland Category:Stone churches in Norway Category:13th- century Church of Norway church buildings Category:1250s works Category:10th- century establishments in Norway ","title":"Avaldsnes Church"},{"id":"844811","text":"A ceiling is an overhead interior surface that covers the upper limits of a room. It is not generally considered a structural element, but a finished surface concealing the underside of the roof structure or the floor of a story above. Ceilings can be decorated to taste, and there are many fine examples of frescoes and artwork on ceilings especially in religious buildings. The most common type of ceiling is the dropped ceiling, which is suspended from structural elements above. Panels of drywall are fastened either directly to the ceiling joists or to a few layers of moisture-proof plywood which are then attached to the joists. Pipework or ducts can be run in the gap above the ceiling, and insulation and fireproofing material can be placed here. Alternatively, ceilings may be spray painted instead, leaving the pipework and ducts exposed but painted, and using spray foam. A subset of the dropped ceiling is the suspended ceiling, wherein a network of aluminum struts, as opposed to drywall, are attached to the joists, forming a series of rectangular spaces. Individual pieces of cardboard are then placed inside the bottom of those spaces so that the outer side of the cardboard, interspersed with aluminum rails, is seen as the ceiling from below. This makes it relatively easy to repair the pipes and insulation behind the ceiling, since all that is necessary is to lift off the cardboard, rather than digging through the drywall and then replacing it. Other types of ceiling include the cathedral ceiling, the concave or barrel-shaped ceiling, the stretched ceiling and the coffered ceiling. Coving often links the ceiling to the surrounding walls. Ceilings can play a part in reducing fire hazard, and a system is available for rating the fire resistance of dropped ceilings. ==Types== California tract home with an open-beam ceiling, 1960 Ceilings are classified according to their appearance or construction. A cathedral ceiling is any tall ceiling area similar to those in a church. A dropped ceiling is one in which the finished surface is constructed anywhere from a few inches or centimeters to several feet or a few meters below the structure above it. This may be done for aesthetic purposes, such as achieving a desirable ceiling height; or practical purposes such as acoustic damping or providing a space for HVAC or piping. An inverse of this would be a raised floor. A concave or barrel-shaped ceiling is curved or rounded upward, usually for visual or acoustical value, while a coffered ceiling is divided into a grid of recessed square or octagonal panels, also called a \\"lacunar ceiling\\". A cove ceiling uses a curved plaster transition between wall and ceiling; it is named for cove molding, a molding with a concave curve. A stretched ceiling (or stretch ceiling) uses a number of individual panels using material such as PVC fixed to a perimeter rail. ==Elements== Ceilings have frequently been decorated with fresco painting, mosaic tiles and other surface treatments. While hard to execute (at least in place) a decorated ceiling has the advantage that it is largely protected from damage by fingers and dust. In the past, however, this was more than compensated for by the damage from smoke from candles or a fireplace. Many historic buildings have celebrated ceilings. Perhaps the most famous is the Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo. Ceiling height may have psychological impacts. ==Fire-resistance rated ceilings== The most common ceiling that contributes to fire-resistance ratings in commercial and residential construction is the dropped ceiling. In the case of a dropped ceiling, the rating is achieved by the entire system, which is both the structure above, from which the ceilings is suspended, which could be a concrete floor or a timber floor, as well as the suspension mechanism and, finally the lowest membrane or dropped ceiling. Between the structure that the dropped ceiling is suspended from and the dropped membrane, such as a T-bar ceiling or a layer of drywall, there is often some room for mechanical and electrical piping, wiring and ducting to run. An independent ceiling, however, can be constructed such that it has a stand-alone fire-resistance rating. Such systems must be tested without the benefit of being suspended from a slab above in order to prove that the resulting system is capable of holding itself up. This type of ceiling would be installed to protect items above from fire. Image:Durasteel_4h_ceiling_1.jpgAn unrestrained non-loadbearing ceiling undergoing a 4-hour fire test.

Entirely freeway, it runs for to connect Ann Arbor with Detroit by way of a connection with Interstate 96 (I-96). The western terminus is at a partial interchange with I-94 west of Ann Arbor. From there, the freeway curves around the north side of Ann Arbor and runs concurrently with US Highway 23 (US 23). East of that section, M-14 passes through woodlands and fields in Washtenaw County. In Wayne County, the freeway returns to a suburban area of mixed residential neighborhoods and light industrial areas. It crosses two different rivers and a pair of rail lines as it approaches Detroit's inner suburbs, where it terminates at an interchange between I-96 and I-275. When the state's highway system was first signed in 1919, there was a different M-14 that ran the length of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. This was later replaced by a pair of different US Highways in the 1920s and 1930s. Another M-14 was designated that lasted until the 1940s. The current highway dates back to 1956 when it was designated along a series of roads that previously carried US 12\\\\. During the 1960s and 1970s, M-14 was moved to the freeway alignment it currently uses; sections of the former route are still maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as unsigned highways. ==Route description== The western terminus of M-14 is west of Ann Arbor, at exit 171 on I-94. This is a partial interchange; only traffic from eastbound I-94 can access eastbound M-14, and traffic from westbound M-14 must follow westbound I-94. From this junction, M-14 runs northeasterly through suburban Scio Township. The freeway is bordered by residential subdivisions to the southeast and woodlands to the northwest. M-14 curves around to the east through an interchange that has ramps that connect Miller and Maple roads; the ramps connect to Maple Road through a pair of roundabouts. As it approaches the Huron River, the freeway has an interchange with Business US 23 (Bus. US 23); the two highways merge and run concurrently to the north over the river. Bus. US 23/M-14 then has an unusual right- in/right-out interchange that uses short connector roads to provide access to Barton Drive on the north side of the river. The freeway then continues north to an interchange with US 23\\\\. The business loop ends there, and M-14 turns eastward to follow the US 23 freeway around the north side of Ann Arbor. The US 23/M-14 freeway runs for about before US 23 turns southward to run between Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti while M-14 continues east through Ann Arbor Township past Domino's Farms, the office complex for Domino's Pizza that was to be the home to Tom Monaghan's Leaning Tower of Pizza. East of that complex, M-14 runs through woodlands and fields north of the community of Dixboro. The freeway turns northeasterly after the interchange with M-153. At the Napier Road underpass, M-14 crosses into Wayne County. Once across the county line, the M-14 freeway runs through residential subdivisions from the western Detroit suburbs. There is an interchange for Beck Road as M-14 turns back to the east. The freeway crosses a rail line operated by CSX Transportation The freeway passes Ford Motor Company's Sheldon Road Plant near the Sheldon Road interchange. There is a crossing for another CSX rail line near the bridges over the River Rouge by the St. Johns Golf Course. The freeway through this area curves around a bit north of its previous course. As M-14 nears the Livonia city line, it meets an interchange with I-96 and I-275 that marks the eastern terminus of M-14 in Plymouth Township. M-14 is maintained by MDOT like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-14 were the 86,500 vehicles daily east of the Sheldon Road interchange in Plymouth Township; the lowest counts were the 26,641 vehicles per day west of the Miller Road interchange. All of M-14 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. ==History== ===Previous designations=== In July 1919, M-14 was signed on a north‚Äìsouth route that ran most of the length of the Lower Peninsula, beginning at the Ohio state line south of Hudson to end south of downtown Cheboygan. It mostly followed the path of present-day US 127, I-75 and M-27. This edition of M-14 was truncated in November 1926 when the US Highway System was formed. From the Jackson area north to Lansing, it was US 127; from Lansing to Cheboygan, it was US 27. In 1930, US 127 was rerouted to replace the remainder of M-14 when US 223 was created. Right afterwards, M-14 was designated from Battle Creek to Edmore. This designation of M-14 was eliminated when M-66 was rerouted to replace it in the mid-1940s. ===Current designation=== In 1956, the portion of US 12 from the west side of Ann Arbor into Detroit was rerouted from surface streets to new stretches of freeways running south of Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti. The former route of US 12, much of which was known as Plymouth Road, was retained as a trunkline and redesignated M-14. In 1964, a northern bypass connecting US 23 with M-153 was completed, and M-14 was rerouted onto the new freeway; the highway still ran through Ann Arbor along routes now designated Bus. US 23 and Business Loop I-94. The following year, the freeway was extended to its present western terminus at I-94, and M-14 is removed from the business routes and transferred to the expressway. In 1977, when the Jeffries Freeway (I-96) was completed, M-14 was shortened to have its eastern terminus at I-275 exit 28 in Plymouth Township, and the portion of Plymouth Road within the city of Detroit was returned to local control. The portion of Plymouth Road‚ÄìAnn Arbor Road between I-275 and the city boundary with Redford Township was retained as an unsigned trunkline, maintained by the state to this day. In 1979, the final segment of the M-14 freeway, between M-153 and I-275 was completed. The former route of M-14 in Washtenaw County along Plymouth‚ÄìAnn Arbor Road was returned to local control. The portion of Ann Arbor Road from the Wayne County line east to I-275 also became an unsigned state trunkline, also still maintained by MDOT. ==Exit list== ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== *M-14 at Michigan Highways 014 Category:Freeways and expressways in Michigan Category:Transportation in Washtenaw County, Michigan Category:Transportation in Wayne County, Michigan ","title":"M-14 (Michigan highway)"},{"id":"844814","text":"McCormack is a family name (surname) that originated in Ireland and Scotland.

In 1528, the county was elevated to a dukedom and peerage of France for him. The Dukes of Guise and their sons played a prominent role in the French Wars of Religion, during which they were the leaders of the ultra- Catholic faction. This dukedom became extinct in 1688, and the lands attached to it passed to the Princess Palatine Anne, a great-granddaughter of Charles of Lorraine-Guise, Duke of Mayenne ‚Äì although she was not the heiress in strict primogeniture, that being the Duke of Mantua.

Each native IDL particle consists of protein that encircles various lipids, enabling, as a water-soluble particle, these lipids to travel in the aqueous blood environment as part of the fat transport system within the body. Their size is, in general, 25 to 35 nm in diameter, and they contain primarily a range of triacylglycerols and cholesterol esters. They are cleared from the plasma into the liver by receptor-mediated endocytosis, or further degraded by hepatic lipase to form LDL particles. Although one might intuitively assume that \\"intermediate-density\\" refers to a density between that of high-density and low-density lipoproteins, it in fact refers to a density between that of low-density and very-low-density lipoproteins. In general, IDL, somewhat similar to low-density lipoprotein (LDL), transports a variety of triglyceride fats and cholesterol and, like LDL, can also promote the growth of atheroma. VLDL is a large, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein secreted by the liver that transports triglyceride to adipose tissue and muscle. The triglycerides in VLDL are removed in capillaries by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, and the VLDL returns to the circulation as a smaller particle with a new name, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL). The IDL particles have lost most of their triglyceride, but they retain cholesteryl esters. Some of the IDL particles are rapidly taken up by the liver; others remain in circulation, where they undergo further triglyceride hydrolysis by hepatic lipase and are converted to LDL. A distinguishing feature of the IDL particle is their content of multiple copies of the receptor ligand ApoE in addition to a single copy of ApoB-100. The multiple copies of ApoE allow IDL to bind to the LDL receptor with a very high affinity. When IDL is converted to LDL, the ApoE leaves the particle and only the ApoB-100 remains. Thereafter, the affinity for the LDL receptor is much reduced.Brown MS and Goldstein JL (1986). A receptor-mediated pathway for cholesterol homeostasis.

When the settlement on this island was relocated to the mainland, the name Manado was brought with it, after which the island itself became referred to as Manado Tua (Old Manado).Willem H. Makaliwe, 1981, A preliminary note on genealogy and intermarriage in the Minahasa regency, North Sulawesi Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde 137, p. 245 The name for Manado in the Sangir language is Manaro. ==History== The first mention of Manado comes from a world map by French cartographer Nicolas Desliens, which shows the island of Manarow (today's Manado Tua). Before Europeans arrived in North Sulawesi, the area was under the rule of the Sultan of Ternate, who exacted tribute, and introduced the Muslim religion among some of its inhabitants. The Portuguese made the Sultan their vassal, taking possession of the Minahasa, and establishing a factory in Wenang. Meanwhile, the Spanish had already set themselves up in the Philippines and Minahasa was used to plant coffee that came from South America because of its rich soil. Manado was further developed by Spain as a centre of commerce for the Chinese traders who traded the coffee in China. With the help of native allies, the Spanish took over the Portuguese fortress in Amurang in the 1550s, and Spanish settlers also established a fort at Manado so that eventually Spain controlled all of the Minahasa. It was in Manado where one of the first Indo-Eurasian (Mestizo) communities in the archipelago developed during the 16th century.Wahr, C.R. Minahasa (history) Website The first King of Manado (1630) named Muntu Untu was in fact the son of a Spanish Mestizo.Wahr, C. R. Minahasa (history) Website Map of Manado in 1679 Spain renounced her possessions in Minahasa by means of a treaty with the Portuguese in return for a payment of 350,000 ducats. Minahasan natives made an alliance treaty with the Dutch, and expelled the last of the Portuguese from Manado a few years later. The Dutch East India Company or Verenigde Oost Indische Compagnie (VOC) built a fortress in Manado named Fort Amsterdam in 1658. As with regions in eastern Indonesia, Manado has undergone Christianisation by Dutch missionaries, including Riedel and John Gottlieb Schwarz. The Dutch missionaries built the first Christian church in Manado called Oude Kerk (Old church), which still stands, and is now called Gereja Sentrum. HMS Dover captured Manado in June 1810. The Javanese prince Diponegoro was exiled to Manado by the Dutch government in 1830 for leading a war of rebellion against the Dutch. In 1859, the English biologist Alfred Wallace visited Manado and praised the town for its beauty. In 1919, the Apostolic Prefecture of Celebes was established in the city. In 1961, it was promoted as the Diocese of Manado. The Japanese captured Manado in the Battle of Manado in January 1942. The city was heavily damaged by Allied bombing during World War II. In 1958, the headquarters of the rebel movement Permesta was moved to Manado. When Permesta confronted the central government with demands for political, economic and regional reform, Jakarta responded by bombing the city in February 1958, and then invading in June 1958. ==Geography== Manado experiences tropical rainforest climate (Af) according to K√∂ppen Climate Classification, as there is no real dry season.

The indigenous people of Manado are from the Tombulu people seen from several urban villages in Manado from the Tombulu language, for example: Wenang (Wenang / Mahawenang - kolintang), Tumumpa (down), Mahakeret (yelling), Tikala Ares (Walak Ares Tombulu, where the word 'ares' means punishable), Ranotana (ground water), Winangun (built), Wawonasa (wawoinasa - above sharpened), Pinaesaan (unity place), Pakowa (Tree of Treasure), Teling (fur / bamboo to make equipment), Titiwungen (excavated), Tuminting (from the word Ting-Ting: the bell, the word insert -um- means showing the verb, so Tuminting: ringing bell), Pondol (Edge), Wanea (from word Wanua: meaning the country), etc. While the Malalayang area has residents mainly from the Bantik people, other indigenous groups in Manado today are from the Sangir, Gorontalo, Mongondow, Babontehu, Talaud, Tionudese, Siau, and Borgo peoples. Most of the Minahasan people are Dutch or other European descent. Due to the large number of Arabian peranakan communities, the existence of the Kampung Arab which is within a radius near Pasar '45 still survives until now, and has become one of the religious tourism destinations. Other ethnicities represented include Javanese, Chinese, Batak, Makassar, and Moluccans. A small Jewish community also exists. GPdI church in Manado Manado Malay is the main language spoken in Manado. It is a Malay-based creole. Some of the loan words in the Minahasan vernacular are derived from Dutch, Portuguese, and other foreign languages. ===Religion=== Yesus Kristus Kase Berkat statue in Manado Christianity is the major religion in Manado, constituting around 67 percent of all residents, Islam comes second forming about 31 percent, and the rest follow Buddhism, Hindusim, and Confucianism, according to the 2010 national census. In addition, about 200 Indonesian Jews live in Manado.https://www.timesofisrael.com/jews-live-in- the-shadows-in-muslim-majority-indonesia/ Even so, heterogeneous, but the people of Manado really appreciate the attitude of tolerant, harmonious, open and dynamic life. Therefore, the city of Manado has a relatively conducive social environment, and is known as one of the most relatively safe cities in Indonesia. When Indonesia was vulnerable to political upheaval around 1999, and riots hit cities in Indonesia, Manado city was said to be relatively safe. This is shown through the slogan of the people of Manado: Torang samua basudara, which means We are all family. And also through the words of Dr. Sam Ratulangi: \\"Sitou, Timou, Tumou, Tou\\", which roughly translates to 'Man lives to educate others'. ==Transportation== Sam Ratulangi International Airport Sam Ratulangi International Airport of Manado is one of the main entry ports to Indonesia. In 2005, no fewer than 15,000 international passengers entered Indonesia via the city's airport, its connected to several Indonesian cities such as Jakarta, Surabaya, Makassar, and others. Other public transportation in Manado are: #Trans Kawanua (bus) #Perum DAMRI buses serving airport to Manado #Bus serving Tomohon to Manado Manado‚ÄìBitung Toll Road connects the city with Bitung. Terminal Malalayang, or Malalayang Bus Terminal serves as the main gateway for long-distance buses in Manado. ==Main sights== Manado is home to some of the biggest and most influential churches in the province, with many of them located along the iconic Sam Ratulangi Street. ===Tourism=== Snorkeling around Bunaken *Ban Hin Kiong Temple is the oldest temple in the city of Manado, which was established in 1819. It is also a popular tourism spot in the city, especially during the Chinese New Year celebration. *Other places of interest include nearby Lake Tondano, Lake Linow, Lokon Volcano, Klabat Volcano and Mahawu Volcano, Bukit Kasih (hill of love), and Watu Pinabetengan. *Citraland, a wealthy suburb of Manado, is home to Asia's second tallest and the world's fourth tallest statue of Christ (Christ Blessing Statue), and perhaps the world's first statue in the flying posture. *Scuba diving and snorkelling are practised in the nearby Bunaken National Park, including the island of Bunaken. *Manado Boulevard Carnaval (MBC) is a fashion carnival annually every 16 July, aligned with Manado City Birthday. *Several shopping malls in the city are: Manado Town Square, Star Square, and Grand Kawanua City ===Cuisine=== Fish Woku RW (dog meat) and Tinorangsak (pork meat) is main common meat used in Minahasan cusisine Food typical of Manado include Tinutuan, which consists of various kinds of vegetables. Tinutuan is not mush, as so far people have said it as Manado porridge. In addition to Tinutuan, there is Cakalang Fufu, a smoked skipjack ('Katsuwonus pelamis'), roa fish (exocoetidae or torani; Parexocoetus brachypterus), Kawok which is food based from rat meat of forest / White (Maxomys hellwandii); Paniki (meat-based dishes bat; Pteropus pumilus) and RW (abbreviated of Rinte Wuuk) is local name of the dog meat, Swine pig (1 pig is burnt by rotating on the embers), usually served at parties, Babi Putar (made from pork mixed with manado spices and rolled burned in bamboo). There is also a typical drink from the area of Manado and its surroundings are saguer which is a kind of wine or palm wine derived from enau / aren tree (Arenga pinnata), which is then fermented. This saguer has an alcohol content, Cap Tikus (high alcoholic beverage with average 40% more ethyl alcohol content derived from saguer distillation process depends on technique in different villages in Minahasa). Manado styled Nasi Kuning Woku is a type of bumbu (spice mixture) found in Manado cuisine of North Sulawesi, Indonesia. It has rich aroma and spicy taste. Woku consist of ground spices paste; red ginger, turmeric, candlenut, and red chili pepper, mixed with chopped shallot, scallion, tomato, lemon or citrus leaf, and turmeric leaf, lemon basil leaf, and bruised lemongrass. Rub main ingredients (chicken or fish) with salt and lime juices, and marinate for 30 minutes. All spices are cooked in coconut oil until the aroma came up and mixed together with the main ingredients, water, and a pinch of salt, well until all cooked well. Other typical food of Manado city which is also quite famous is Nasi Kuning which taste and its presentation is different from yellow rice in other area because it is spiked with abon of cakalang rica fish and presented in parcel using sugar palm leaves. In addition, there are also grilled fish roasted head. Dabu-dabu is a very popular typical of Manado sauce, made from a mixture of red chillies, cayenne pepper, sliced red onion, and freshly diced tomatoes, and finally given a mixture of soy sauce. ==Sister cities== * Eindhoven, Netherlands * San Sebastian, Spain * Cebu, Philippines * Zamboanga City, Philippines * Davao, Philippines * Bristol, United Kingdom * Liverpool, United Kingdom * Koror, Palau * Qingdao, China ==Language== The local language spoken in Manado and the surrounding area is a creole of the Malay language called Manado Malay. It exhibits significant influence of Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch, for example: *Chair in Indonesian is kursi, in the Minahasa it is called kadera (cadeira - Portuguese word for chair). *Horse in Indonesian is kuda, a word of Sanskrit origin. In the town of Tomohon, a horse is called kafalio ('cavalo - Portuguese', \\"caballo - Spanish). *But in Indonesian is tetapi, in Manado it is called mar (maar- Dutch word for but). While there is not much known about the origin of ideogramatical Minahasa writing system, currently the orthography used for indigenous Minahasan languages closely matches that used for Indonesian. ==Notable people== ;Leading figures in Indonesian history *Robert Wolter Mongisidi, Indonesian national hero *Alexander Andries Maramis, Foreign Minister of Indonesia, Minister of Finance *Lambertus Nicodemus Palar, Indonesian national hero, first Indonesian representative to the United Nations *John Lie, Indonesian national hero *Elias Daniel (Daan) Mogot, first director of the Tangerang Military Academy *Arie Frederik Lasut, Indonesian national hero, co-founder of Indonesia's first Mining and Geological Service *Gerungan Saul Samuel Jozias (Sam) Ratulangi, Indonesian national hero, member of the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence, first governor of Sulawesi *Pierre Andries Tendean, Indonesian revolutionary hero *Maria Walanda Maramis, Indonesian national hero, pioneer of women's rights in Indonesia *Marie Thomas, first Indonesian female physician, first Indonesian specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology *Alexander Evert Kawilarang, Indonesian military commander, freedom fighter, commander of military strategy and tactics, founder of Indonesian Special Forces. ;Important figures in Manadonese history *Jacob Frederick (Joop) Warouw, commander of TT-VII/Indonesia Timur, leader of Permesta movement *Anna Adeline Warouw, second Indonesian female physician, specialist in otorhinolaryngology *Herman Nicolas Ventje Sumual, leader of Permesta movement *Bernard Wilhelm Lapian, Indonesian national hero, church leader, second governor of Sulawesi ;Other community figures *Adolf Gustaaf Lembong, commander of 16th Division *Gustaf Hendrik Mantik, commander of Military Territory, governor of North Sulawesi *Herling Laoh, Indonesian Public Works and Transportation Minister *Gustaaf Adolf Maengkom, Indonesian Justice Minister *Freddy Jaques Inkiriwang, Minister of Industry *Arnold Isaac Zacharias Mononutu, Indonesian Information Minister, first ambassador of Indonesia to China, rector of Hassanuddin University *Reyn Altin Johannes Lumenta, President and CEO of Garuda Indonesia *Clayton Allen Wenas (Tony Wenas), Chief Director of PT Freeport Indonesia in the Grasberg mine *Rocky Gerung, philosopher *Sonita Lontoh, Technocrat of internet of things, Executive at Siemens, Digital Grid, Silicon Valley, USA; founder of Silicon Valley Asia Technology Alliance; Chairman of IDF *Thomas Lembong, Minister of Trade of Indonesia; Head of Indonesia's Investment Coordinating Board ;Sportspeople and actors *Jolene Marie Cholock Rotinsulu, Indonesian Actress, Puteri Indonesia Lingkungan 2019 and Miss International 2019 pageant. *Kezia Roslin Cikita Warouw, Puteri Indonesia 2016 and Top 13 and Miss Phoenix Smile at Miss Universe 2016 pageant. *Kristania Virginia Besouw, Miss Indonesia 2006, contestant at Miss World 2006 pageant *Lilyana Natsir, badminton player and gold medalist at 2016 Summer Olympics *Setyana Mapasa, badminton player *Revo Marty, Indonesian Singer *Firman Utina, Indonesian national footballer *Dougy Mandagi, vocalist from The Temper Trap *Rima Melati, actress *Marcellino Lefrandt, actor *Fictor Gideon Roring, Indonesian Basketball League head coach for Garuda Bandung *Julie Estelle, actress *Mikha Tambayong, actress *Angel Karamoy, singer and actress *Nagita Slavina, actress ==See also== *List of regencies and cities of Indonesia ==References== * ==External links== * * Category:Cities in Indonesia Category:Populated coastal places in Indonesia Category:Populated places in North Sulawesi Category:Provincial capitals in Indonesia ","title":"Manado"},{"id":"844868","text":"This mint stamp of the 1918 Russian revolution era is much less commonly found used.A mint high value 100 Rupee key type stamp of Ceylon valid for postage or revenue use and vulnerable to tampering to remove a fiscal cancel to make it appear to be a more valuable unused stamp. In philately, a mint stamp is one which is in its original state of issue, is unused, has never been mounted and has full gum, if issued with gum.Mackay, James. Stamp Collecting: Philatelic Terms Illustrated. 4th edition. London: Stanley Gibbons, 2003, p.88. Youngblood, Wayne L. All about Stamps. Iola WI: Krause Publications, 2000, p.109. The term applies equally to postage stamps and revenue stamps. In practice, the term is used within philately to refer to any stamp that appears to be unused, including those without gum, or previously hinged. Unlike other collectibles, a mint stamp may be in poor condition but still be regarded as being in mint state as long as it is apparently unused. == Variations == Variations of the term mint include: *Mint hinged (MH) ‚Äì the stamp is unused but has been previously hinged. Remains of the hinge or gum disturbance are visible. *Mounted mint (MM) ‚Äì the same as Mint hinged. *Mint no gum (MNG) ‚Äì the stamp appears to be unused but has no gum. It might have been used but not cancelled, or have been issued without gum. *Unmounted mint (UM) ‚Äì the stamp is unused and appears never to have been mounted. *Mint never hinged (MNH) ‚Äì the same as unmounted mint but with an assertion that the stamp is not a formerly mounted stamp that has been tampered with to remove traces of mounting. The hinging referred to in these terms is mounting of the stamp in a stamp album by the application of a stamp hinge to the back of the stamp. The highest grade is unmounted mint or mint never hinged. The term mint never hinged has developed to provide reassurance to buyers that the stamp has not been tampered with to remove traces of mounting, as the term unmounted mint was thought to be ambiguous. == Value == Mint stamps are often more valuable than used stamps as in many cases fewer mint stamps survive. A mint stamp may also be in better condition than a used stamp which has passed through the mail. Sometimes, however, used stamps may be more valuable than mint ones where higher numbers of mint stamps have survived, perhaps because large numbers of mint stamps were bought by collectors but few used on letters.Robert Murray, \\"Are Used or Unused Stamps Worth More?\\". == Tampering == Differences between mint and used values for the same stamp have led to a small industry in removing, or adding, postal cancellations to stamps. Another common practice is to attempt to remove fiscal cancellations, which are often pen cancels, in order to change a stamp used fiscally (for tax purposes) to one apparently unused. Stamps available for both postage and revenue (fiscal) purposes are usually worth more unused or with a postal cancellation. Madame Joseph specialised in the addition of forged cancels to stamps that were worth more used than unused. ==See also== * Mint condition * Pen cancel * Postage stamp gum * Regummed stamp * Stamp condition == References == Category:Philatelic terminology ","title":"Mint stamp"},{"id":"844877","text":"In contract law, a warranty is a promise which is not a condition of the contract or an innominate term: (1) it is a term \\"not going to the root of the contract\\",Hogg M. (2011). Promises and Contract Law: Comparative Perspectives, p. 48, Cambridge University Press. and (2) which only entitles the innocent party to damages if it is breached:Ibid i.e. the warranty is not true or the defaulting party does not perform the contract in accordance with the terms of the warranty. A warranty is not a guarantee. It is a mere promise. It may be enforced if it is breached by an award for the legal remedy of damages. A warranty is a term of a contract. Depending on the terms of the contract, a product warranty may cover a product such that a manufacturer provides a warranty to a consumer with which the manufacturer has no direct contractual relationship. A warranty may be express or implied. An express warranty is expressly stated (typically, written); whether or not a term will be implied into a contract depends on the particular contract law of the country in question. Warranties may also state that a particular fact is true at one point in time or that the fact will continue into the future (a \\"continuing warranty\\"). == Sale of goods == Warranties provided in the sale of goods (tangible products) vary according to jurisdiction, but commonly new goods are sold with implied warranty that the goods are as advertised. Used products, however, may be sold \\"as is\\" with no warranties. Each country, however, defines its own parameters with regard to implied conditions or implied warranties. This is because each country (a country as defined by international civil law) has its own system of contract law with its own set of rules. Said rules are largely standardised; i.e., the concepts of offer, acceptance, consideration, capacity to contract and intention to create legal relations. Those are the five elements to create a legally binding contract in the United States (all 50 states), England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, each of the seven states of Australia, and all other common law countries. Countries with civil law, however, recognise legally binding contracts which are not supported by consideration. In the United States, various laws apply, including provisions in the Uniform Commercial Code which provide for implied warranties.Warranties in Sales of Goods. LexisNexis Study Outlines. However, these implied warranties were often limited by disclaimers. In 1975 the Magnuson‚ÄìMoss Warranty Act was passed to strengthen warranties on consumer goods. Among other things, under the law implied warranties cannot be disclaimed if an express warranty is offered, and attorney fees may be recovered.12 Reasons to Love the Magnuson-Moss Act. Journal of Texas Consumer Law. Reprinted with permission from the National Consumer Law Center. In some states, statutory warranties are required on new home construction, and \\"lemon laws\\" apply to motor vehicles. === Express warranty === Express warranties are created when the seller makes a guarantee to the buyer that the product/service being offered has certain qualities. For there to exist an express warranty 1) a statement regarding the product/service must be made to the buyer and 2) the statement must play a role in the buyers decision to purchase the product/service. If, after purchase, the buyer feels that the given statement was a misrepresentation of the actual product/service, the buyer can file for breach of express warranty. === Implied warranty === Implied warranties are unwritten promises that arise from the nature of the transaction, and the inherent understanding by the buyer, rather than from the express representations of the seller. In the United States, Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (which has been adopted with variations in each state) provides that the following two warranties are implied unless they are explicitly disclaimed (such as an \\"as is\\" statement): *The warranty of merchantability is implied unless expressly disclaimed by name, or the sale is identified with the phrase \\"as is\\" or \\"with all faults.\\" To be \\"merchantable\\", the goods must reasonably conform to an ordinary buyer's expectations. For example, a fruit that looks and smells good but has hidden defects may violate the warranty if its quality does not meet the standards for such fruit \\"as passes ordinarily in the trade\\". In most states, products inherently come with implied warranty of mechantiblity; however, in states like Massachusetts under consumer protection law, it is illegal to disclaim this warranty on household goods sold to consumers. (Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 106: Section 2-316A) *The warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is implied unless disclaimed when a buyer relies upon the seller to select the goods to fit a specific request. For example, this warranty is violated when a buyer asks a mechanic to provide tires for use on snowy roads and receives tires that are unsafe to use in snow. === Defects In Materials and Workmanship. === A common kind of warranty on goods is a warranty that the product is free from material defects in materials and workmanship. This simply promises that the manufacturer properly constructed the product, out of proper materials. This implies that the product is not defective for the purposes for which it was made. Warranties may be time limited, thus limiting the time the buyer has to make a claim for breach of warranty. For example, a typical 90-day warranty on a television gives the buyer 90 days from the date of purchase to claim that the television was improperly constructed. Should the television fail after 91 days of normal usage, which because televisions customarily last longer than 91 days means there was a defect in the materials or workmanship of the television, the buyer nonetheless may not collect on the warranty because it is too late to file a claim. Consumer protection law, implement by statute, however provide additional remedies as it is not usually expected that a television will last for only 90 days. Time-limited warranties are often confused with performance warranties. A 90-day performance warranty would promise that the television would work for 90 days, which is fundamentally different from promising that it was delivered free of defects and limiting the time the buyer has to prove otherwise. But because the usual evidence that a product was delivered defective is that it later breaks, the effect is very similar. One situation in which the effect of a time-limited warranty is different from the effect of a performance warranty is where the time limit exceeds a normal lifetime of the product. If a coat is designed to last two years, but has a 10-year limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship, a buyer who wears the coat for 3 years and then finds it worn out would not be able to collect on the warranty. But it is different from a 2-year warranty because if the buyer starts wearing the coat 5 years after buying it, and finds it wears out a year later, the buyer would have a warranty claim in Year 6. On the other hand, a 10-year performance warranty would promise that the coat would last 10 years. === Satisfaction guarantee === In the United States, the Magnuson‚ÄìMoss Warranty Act of 1976 provides for enforcement of a satisfaction guarantee warranty. In these cases, the advertiser must refund the full purchase price regardless of the reason for dissatisfaction.Andreoni J. (2005). Trust, Reciprocity, and Contract Enforcement: Experiments on Satisfaction Guaranteed. === Lifetime warranty === A lifetime warranty is usually a warranty against defects in materials and workmanship that has no time limit to make a claim, rather than a warranty that the product will perform for the lifetime of the buyer.Lifetime Warranties. Warranty Week. WebCite Archive. The actual time that product can be expected to perform is normally determined by the custom for products of its kind used the way the buyer uses it. If a product has been discontinued and is no longer available, the warranty may last a limited period longer. For example: * the Cisco Limited Lifetime Warranty currently lasts for five years after the product has been discontinued, but only if you know where you bought it from as the seller is responsible for administering it. * HP Networking product lifetime warranties last for as long as one owns the product. === Breach of warranty === Warranties are breached when the promise is not performed at all, or not performed in accordance with the contract. The seller may honor the warranty by making a refund or a replacement. The statute of limitations depends on the jurisdiction and contractual agreements. In the United States, the Uniform Commercial Code ¬ß 2-725 provides for a four-year time limit, which can be limited to one year by contract, starting from the date of delivery or if future performance is guaranteed from the date of discovery. Refusing to honor the warranty may be an unfair business practice. In the United States, breach of warranty lawsuits may be distinct from revocation of contract suits; in the case of the breach of warranty, the buyer's item is repaired or replaced while breach of contract involves returning the item to the seller.Davis T. (2009). UCC Breach of Warranty and Contract Claims: Clarifying the Distinction. Baylor Law Review. Some warranties require that repairs be undertaken by an authorized service provider. In such cases, service by non-authorized personnel or company may void (nullify) the warranty. However, according to the Magnuson-Moss Act (a U.S. Federal law that governs warranties, which was passed in 1975), if the warranty does not provide full or partial payment of labor (to repair the device or system), it is the owner's choice who will provide the labor, including the possibility of DIY (\\"Do It Yourself\\") repairs, in which case the device or system owner will pay zero dollars for labor, yet the company that provided the warranty must still provide all the parts needed for the repair at absolutely no charge to the owner. If the defective product causes injury, this may be a cause of action for a product liability lawsuit (tort). Strict liability may be applied. == Extended warranty == In addition to standard warranties on new items, third parties or manufacturers may sell or offer extended warranties (also called service contracts). These extend the warranty for a further length of time. However, these warranties have terms and conditions which may not match the original terms and conditions. For example, these may not cover anything other than mechanical failure from normal usage. Exclusions may include commercial use, \\"acts of God\\", owner abuse, and malicious destruction. They may also exclude parts that normally wear out such as tires and lubrication on a vehicle. These types of warranties are provided for various products, but automobiles and electronics are common examples. Warranties which are sold through retailers such as Best Buy may include significant commission for the retailer as a result of reverse competition.Baker T, Siegelman P. (2013). Protecting Consumers from Add-On Insurance Products: New Lessons for Insurance Regulation. For instance, an auto warranty from a car dealership may be subcontracted and vehicle repairs may be at a lower rate which could compromise the quality of service. At the time of repair, out-of-pocket expenses may be charged for unexpected services provided outside of the warranty terms or uncovered parts. == Representations versus warranties == Statements of fact in a contract or in obtaining the contract are considered to be either warranties or representations. Traditionally, warranties are factual promises which are enforced through a contract legal action, regardless of materiality, intent, or reliance. Representations are traditionally *pre*contractual statements which allow for a tort-based action if the misrepresentation is innocent, negligent or fraudulent.Primack MA. (2009), and it was relied upon by a party to enter into the contract. Representations, Warranties and Covenants: Back to the Basics in Contracts, and do not form part of the contract. National Law Review. In U.S. law, the distinction between the two is somewhat unclear; warranties are viewed as primarily contract-based legal action while negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations are tort-based, but there is a confusing mix of case law in the United States.West GD, Lewis WB. (2009). Contracting to Avoid Extra- Contractual Liability‚ÄîCan Your Contractual Deal Ever Really Be the \\"Entire\\" Deal? The Business Lawyer. In modern English law, sellers often avoid using the term 'represents' in order to avoid claims under the Misrepresentation Act 1967 (although English law will look to the substance rather than the form of the representation to decide what it is), while in America 'warrants and represents' is relatively common.Ferara LN, Philips J, Runnicles J. (2007). Some Differences in Law and Practice Between U.K. and U.S. Stock Purchase Agreements. Jones Day Publications. Some modern commentators suggest avoiding the words and substituting 'state' or 'agree', and some model forms do not use the words; however, others disagree.Telman J. (2012). Representations and Warranties. ContractsProf Blog. == Product types == === Appliance warranty === ====Canada and United States==== Written warranties on new major appliances, such as refrigerators, kitchen stoves and dishwashers, usually cover the cost of parts and labor to repair defects in materials or workmanship which appear under normal home use. Warranties often cover defects up to a year after purchase or delivery. However some exclude new owners when a house or appliance is sold within the year (Frigidaire, LG, Samsung). Others do let warranties transfer to new buyers (Amana, General Electric, Whirlpool). Some manufacturers cover refrigerators' sealed parts (compressors, tubing, etc.) for five years (General Electric, Samsung, Whirlpool) or seven years (LG) or ten years (KitchenAid). Warranties on water heaters cover parts for 5 to 12 years in single family residences, one year otherwise. They do not cover new owners when a house or heater is sold; nor do they cover the original owner if the heater is moved to a second location. Tank models from A. O. Smith do not allow heating elements to be replaced with lower (or higher) wattages, and do not cover renter-occupied single family. They end if the unit is flooded or ever uses desalinated or deionized water, such as municipal desalination plants or reverse osmosis filters. Smith's tank models for manufactured housing do not provide coverage if a whirlpool or hot tub is connected. Tank water heater warranties exclude labor, liability for water damage, and shipping cost to return the old heater or parts. Tankless warranties do not exclude water damage; they cover labor for a year, and Ruud/Rheem covers return shipping on tankless models. Smith's tankless water heaters do not restrict coverage to a single family, and require professional installation. Implied warranties under US law could extend for longer periods. However, most states allow the written warranties to include clauses which limit these implied warranties to the same time period as the written warranty. === Car warranty === ====United States==== New car factory warranties commonly range from one year to five years and in some cases extend even 10 years, with typically a mileage limit as well. Car warranties can be extended by the manufacturer or other companies with a renewal fee. Used car warranties are usually 3 months and 3,000 miles ====United Kingdom==== In the United Kingdom, types of warranties have been classified as either an: # original manufacturer warranty, # insurance warranty underwritten and regulated as insurance or # obligor warranty, typically written by a car dealership or garage. In the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which began to regulate insurance contracts in this context in 2005, determined that additional warranties sold by car dealerships are \\"unlikely to be insurance\\".What is a contract of insurance?. Financial Services Authority. Insurance warranties may offer greater protection to the consumer. === Home Warranty === A home warranty protects against the costs of home and appliance repair by offering home warranty coverage for houses, townhomes, condominiums, mobile homes, and new construction homes. When a problem occurs with a covered appliance or mechanical system such as an air conditioning unit or furnace, a service technician repairs or replaces it. The homeowner may have to pay for a service call fee and the home warranty company pays the balance for the repair or replacement of the covered item. ==Warranty data== Warranty data consists of claims data and supplementary data. Claims data are the data collected during the servicing of claims under warranty and supplementary data are additional data such as production and marketing data.Wu S. (2012). Warranty Data Analysis: A Review. Quality and Reliability Engineering International.

In the 1970s, Heidemann bought the yacht Carin II, which had belonged to Hermann G√∂ring, met his daughter Edda G√∂ring and had an affair with her which lasted for five years. They entertained on the yacht and their guests included two Second World War generals, Karl Wolff and Wilhelm Mohnke. Heidemann came forward with his story of lost diaries written by Adolf Hitler in 1983. He sold the rights to the West German magazine Stern for DM 10,000,000 (then approximately US$6 million), along with his tale about how they had been hidden in a barn in East Germany for many years. Several experts, including the British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, came forward to pronounce the diaries to be authentic. The \\"diaries\\" were exposed as fabrications and Heidemann was arrested, tried and sentenced in 1985 to four and a half years in prison for fraud. Konrad Kujau, who had forged the diary, as he had done previously with other fraudulent Hitler documents was also imprisoned. Heidemann had also stolen some of the money from Kujau; he was renting expensive residences, buying new cars and jewellery and buying more Nazi memorabilia. In 2002 it was revealed that Heidemann had worked for the Stasi, although he claimed he had been a double agent.

(CPI(M)), seeing its participation in the United Front government in West Bengal as a betrayal. Initially the group was known as AICCR of the CPI(M), and partially functioned as an inner-party fraction. AICCCR claimed that the Indian political situation was ripe for armed revolution and denounced participation in the Electoral Politics. The leaders of AICCCR were Charu Majumdar and Kanu Sanyal. The first meeting if AICCCR in November 1967 was attended by the following persons: * Shiv Kumar Mishra (Uttar Pradesh) * S. N. Tiwari (Uttar Pradesh) * Satyanarayan Singh (Bihar) * Lakshman Singh (Bihar) * Appu (Madras) * Sambhunathan (Madras) * Babu (Mysore) * Kunnikkal Narayan (Kerala) * Philip Prasad (Kerala) * Rabi Das (Orissa) * Radha Mohan Das (Orissa) * Charu Majumdar (West Bengal) * Sushital Roy Chowdhury (West Bengal) * Saroj Dutta (West Bengal) * Asit Sen (West Bengal) * Pramod Ranjan Sengupta (West Bengal) * Parimal Das Gupta (West Bengal) After the Burdwan plenum of CPI(M) in April 1968 the group changed its name to just AICCCR. At the second meeting of AICCCR in May 1968 there Punjab was also represented. In August 1968 Parimal Das Gupta broke away from AICCCR. In September 1968 Andhra Pradesh Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries joined AICCCR. In February 1969 the Andhra Pradesh Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries was expelled from AICCCR. Rapidly after the expulsion of APCCCR, AICCCR organized an Andhra State Coordination Committee with Tejeshwara Rao as the convenor. AICCCR mainly drew its support from the Srikakulam district. On 22 April 1969 AICCCR formed the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). ==References== Category:Defunct communist parties in India Category:Political parties established in 1967 Category:1967 establishments in India Category:Political parties disestablished in 1969 Category:1969 disestablishments in India ","title":"All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries"},{"id":"844911","text":"Merism (Latin merismus, Greek ŒºŒµœÅŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ merism√≥s) is a linguistic phenomenon in which a combination of two contrasting parts of the whole refer to the whole. For example, in order to say that someone \\"searched everywhere\\", one could use the merism \\"searched high and low\\". Another example is the sword-and-sandal movie genre, a loose term for a genre of movies made principally in Italy in the 1950s and 1960s set in Classical antiquity. Merisms are common in the Old Testament. For example, in Genesis 1:1, when God creates ◊ê◊™ ◊î◊©◊û◊ô◊ù ◊ï◊ê◊™ ◊î◊ê◊®◊• (Modern pronunciation: et hashamaim ve-et haarets) \\"the heavens and the earth\\" (New Revised Standard Version), the two parts (heavens and earth) do not refer only to the heavens and the earth. Rather, they refer to the heavens, the earth and everything between them, i.e. God created the entire world, the whole universe. Other famous examples of Biblical merisms are Genesis 1:5, where ‚Äúevening‚Äù and ‚Äúmorning‚Äù refer to ‚Äúone day‚Äù (including noon, afternoon etc.); and Psalm 139, where the psalmist declares that God knows ‚Äúmy downsitting and my uprising‚Äù, i.e. God knows all the psalmist‚Äôs actions. ==Etymology== The term entered English in 1894 in the biological sense, but had appeared earlier in rhetorical contexts where it denoted \\"'synecdoche in which totality is expressed by contrasting parts' (such as high and low, young and old)\\". It derives from Modern Latin merismus, from Greek ŒºŒµœÅŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ merismos 'a dividing or partitioning', ultimately from merizein 'to divide', from meros 'part, share'. ==Biological usage== In biology, a merism is a repetition of similar parts in the structure of an organism (Bateson 1894). Such features are called meristic characters, and the study of such characters is called meristics. ==Legal usage== Merisms frequently figure in the writing of lawyers, and are a hallmark of legal style. The two parts of the legal merism \\"Last Will and Testament\\" at one time referred to two documents, enforced in two separate courts: the will disposed of a decedent's real property while the testament disposed of chattels. It became customary to combine the instruments in a single dispositive document, and the name has continued long after the doctrines that required its use became obsolete in common law. A lawyer who writes a will typically includes a residuary clause that disposes of any property not covered by a prior section. The weight of tradition is such that the lawyer writing such a document will often phrase it something like this: Traditionally, a gift of real property was called a \\"devise\\" whereas a gift of other property was a \\"bequest\\". Nowadays, the words \\"bequeath\\" and \\"devise\\" are synonymous in most jurisdictions so that \\"I bequeath the rest of my property to ...\\" is enough in both law and logic to achieve the same result. Many deeds frequently contain a traditional clause that says that the grantee is \\"to have and to hold\\" the property conveyed; this usage goes back to the days in which the instruments were drawn up in Latin, and is sometimes called a \\"habendam et tenendam\\" clause. The use of legal merisms seldom if ever adds legal effect to the document that contains them, and frequently increases their reading difficulty. However, the weight of tradition and the fear that a deviation from the established formula might have unintended legal consequences makes lawyers reluctant to revise the traditional formulae, and their clients, seeing them, at least draw the satisfaction of knowing that their documents appear to be written by a lawyer. In some cases, the doubling (or even tripling) of constituent parts in these meristic constructions arose as a result of the transition of legal discourse from Latin to French, and then from French to English. During such periods, key terms were paired with synonyms from multiple languages in an attempt to prevent ambiguity and ensure hermeneutic consistency. == See also == * Synecdoche, referring to a whole by the name of one of its parts (or vice versa): :* Pars pro toto, where the part is used to refer to the whole. :* Totum pro parte, where the whole is used to refer to a part. * Lock, stock, and barrel ==References== ==Further reading== *William Bateson, Materials For The Study Of Variation: Treated With Especial Regard To Discontinuity In The Origin Of Species (Macmillan and Co., 1894) *Bryan A.

Green denotes = 0 states, blue, = ¬Ω and red, = 1. The vertical axis is the mass. Exotic mesons are mesons that have quantum numbers not possible in the quark model; some proposals for non-standard quark model mesons could be: ;glueballs or gluonium: Glueballs have no valence quarks at all. ;tetraquarks: Tetraquarks have two valence quark-antiquark pairs. ;hybrid mesons: Hybrid mesons contain a valence quark-antiquark pair and one or more gluons. All exotic mesons are classed as mesons because they are hadrons and carry zero baryon number. Of these, glueballs must be flavor singlets ‚Äì that is, must have zero isospin, strangeness, charm, bottomness, and topness. Like all particle states, exotic mesons are specified by the quantum numbers which label representations of the Poincar√© symmetry, q.e., by the mass (enclosed in parentheses), and by , where is the angular momentum, is the intrinsic parity, and is the charge conjugation parity; One also often specifies the isospin of the meson. Typically, every quark model meson comes in SU(3) flavor nonet: an octet and an associated flavor singlet. A glueball shows up as an extra (supernumerary) particle outside the nonet. In spite of such seemingly simple counting, the assignment of any given state as a glueball, tetraquark, or hybrid remains tentative even today, hence the preference for the more generic term exotic meson. Even when there is agreement that one of several states is one of these non-quark model mesons, the degree of mixing, and the precise assignment is fraught with uncertainties. There is also the considerable experimental labor of assigning quantum numbers to each state and crosschecking them in other experiments. As a result, all assignments outside the quark model are tentative. The remainder of this article outlines the situation as it stood at the end of 2004. ==Lattice predictions== Lattice QCD predictions for glueballs are now fairly settled, at least when virtual quarks are neglected. The two lowest states are ::0++ with mass of and ::2++ with mass of The 0‚àí+ and exotic glueballs such as 0‚àí‚àí are all expected to lie above . Glueballs are necessarily isoscalar, with isospin = 0\\\\. The ground state hybrid mesons 0‚àí+, 1‚àí+, 1‚àí‚àí, and 2‚àí+ all lie a little below . The hybrid with exotic quantum numbers 1‚àí+ is at . The best lattice computations to date are made in the quenched approximation, which neglects virtual quarks loops. As a result, these computations miss mixing with meson states. ==The ++ states== The data show five isoscalar resonances: (500), (980), (1370), (1500), and (1710). Of these the (500) is usually identified with the of chiral models. The decays and production of (1710) give strong evidence that it is also a meson. ===Glueball candidate=== The (1370) and (1500) cannot both be a quark model meson, because one is supernumerary. The production of the higher mass state in two photon reactions such as or reactions is highly suppressed. The decays also give some evidence that one of these could be a glueball. ===Tetraquark candidate=== The (980) has been identified by some authors as a tetraquark meson, along with the = 1 states (980) and (800). Two long-lived (narrow in the jargon of particle spectroscopy) states: the scalar (0) state (2317) and the vector (1) meson (2460), observed at CLEO and BaBar, have also been tentatively identified as tetraquark states. However, for these, other explanations are possible. ==The states== Two isoscalar states are definitely identified: (1270) and the ‚Ä≤(1525). No other states have been consistently identified by all experiments. Hence it is difficult to say more about these states. ==The exotics and other states== The two isovector exotics 1(1400) and 1(1600) seem to be well established experimentally. A recent coupled-channel analysis has shown these states, which were initially considered separate, are consistent with a single pole. A second exotic state is disfavored. The assignment of these states as hybrids is favored. Lattice QCD calculations show the lightest with 1 quantum numbers has strong overlap with operators featuring gluonic construction. The (1800) 0, (1900) 1 and the (1870) 2 are fairly well identified states, which have been tentatively identified as hybrids by some authors. If this identification is correct, then it is a remarkable agreement with lattice computations, which place several hybrids in this range of masses. ==See also== *Quark model, mesons, baryons, quarks, and gluons *Exotic hadrons and exotic baryons *Quantum chromodynamics, flavor, and the QCD vacuum *GlueX, an experiment which will explore the spectrum of glueballs and exotic mesons ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Mesons Category:Hypothetical composite particles ","title":"Exotic meson"},{"id":"844920","text":"Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) is a website provided by NASA and Michigan Technological University (MTU). According to the website, \\"Each day a different image or photograph of our universe is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer.\\" The photograph does not necessarily correspond to a celestial event on the exact day that it is displayed, and images are sometimes repeated. However, the pictures and descriptions often relate to current events in astronomy and space exploration. The text has several hyperlinks to more pictures and websites for more information. The images are either visible spectrum photographs, images taken at non-visible wavelengths and displayed in false color, video footage, animations, artist's conceptions, or micrographs that relate to space or cosmology. Past images are stored in the APOD Archive, with the first image appearing on June 16, 1995. This initiative has received support from NASA, the National Science Foundation, and MTU. The images are sometimes authored by people or organizations outside NASA, and therefore APOD images are often copyrighted, unlike many other NASA image galleries. When APOD began it received only 14 page views on its first day. As of 2012 it had received over a billion image views. APOD is also translated into 21 languages daily. APOD was presented at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in 1996. Its practice of using hypertext was analyzed in a paper in 2000.

He is widely regarded as one of the most musical of American avant-garde poets. Enslin was born in Chester, Pennsylvania. His father was a biblical scholar and his mother a Latin scholar. He studied musical composition at Cambridge, Massachusetts. His teacher, Nadia Boulanger, was the first person to recognize his ability as a writer and encouraged him to pursue his interest in poetry. He has said \\"I like to be considered as a composer who happens to use words instead of notes.\\" His first book, The Work Proposed, was published by Origin in 1958. Enslin moved to Maine in 1960 and had lived in Washington County ever since, working at odd jobs and making and selling handmade walking sticks. The Maine landscape forms an integral part of his poetry, as does its isolation, both geographic and in terms of distance from literary fashion and the academy, on the physical margin of the United States.

It was named after the Oscott area of Birmingham, when St. Mary's College, the Roman Catholic seminary, moved from that site to the new one. The original then became known as Old Oscott. The only pub in New Oscott is the Beggars Bush. The area also hosts the Princess Alice Retail Park and adjacent Tesco Extra superstore. Princess Alice Retail Park was the site of a large and well known children's home from the late 19th century. When the site was sold for redevelopment in the 1980s the home was demolished leaving Brampton Hall which was a Community Centre serving the local area. Brampton Hall offered a range of classes and interest groups to the community and was a popular venue for parties and children's birthday parties. In recent years, this hall got knocked down and turned into a fast food chain, KFC. The area near The Beggars Bush used to be home to a traffic island which was removed and a new double traffic light system was put into place. The name Beggar's Bush derives from a thorn bush that was located in the middle of the Chester Road and was encircled by iron railings. At an unknown date, it is said that a beggar died after sheltering under the bush, and as the bush marked the boundary of the parish, there was debate over who should pay for the burial of the man. The bush was destroyed by road workers in the mid-1930s to the disapproval of locals. ==References== *The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield - A Commemorative History, Douglas V.

The foundation of the party was declared by Kanu Sanyal at a mass meeting in Calcutta on 22 April, Vladimir Lenin's birthday. Later the party splintered into several minor Naxal/Maoist groups. ==Origin== The CPI (ML) was formed by the radicals within the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) who grew concerned by the increasingly parliamentary character of its politics. A debate ensued where the radicals accused the CPM leadership of turning towards revisionism. Finally, the party purged the radicals, who went to form the CPI (ML). The CPI (ML) advocated armed revolution and denounced participation in the electoral process. Its leaders were Charu Majumdar and Saroj Dutta, both of whom had belonged to the left-wing within the CPM in northern West Bengal. Sanyal, Jongol Santhal and his followers had mobilized a revolutionary peasants movement in Naxalbari, which evolved into an armed uprising of the mostly Santhal tribal inhabitants. CPI (ML) saw Naxalbari as the spark that would start a new Indian revolution, and the movement came to be known as \\"naxalites\\". In several parts of India, for example Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, other parts of West Bengal, and in Srikakulam in northern Andhra Pradesh, the CPI (ML) organized guerilla units. The party got moral support from China, which actively encouraged the attempts of CPI (ML) to launch revolution. According to Pradip Basu in his book Towards Naxalbari (1953-1967): An Account of Inner-Party Ideological Struggle: > \\"There were two nuclei of radicals in the party organisation in West Bengal. > One 'theorist' section around Parimal Das Gupta in Calcutta, which wanted to > persuade the party leadership to correct revisionist mistakes through inner- > party debate, and one 'actionist' section led by Charu Majumdar and Kanu > Sanyal in North Bengal. The 'actionists' were impatient, and strived to > organize armed uprisings. According to Basu, due to the prevailing political > climate of youth and student rebellion it was the 'actionists' which came to > dominate the new Maoist movement in India, instead of the more theoretically > advanced sections.\\" === Naxalbari uprising === It occurred in Naxalbari of Siliguri subdivision, Darjeeling district under the leadership of communist leaders like Charu Majumdar and others who later became the part of CPI (ML). === Srikakulam peasant uprising === In the Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh, communist leaders aligned themselves with the then formed AICCCR and launched peasant upsurge in Srikakulam which continued for almost 5 years in late 1960s and early 1970s. ==After 1970== The first party congress was held in Calcutta 1970. A Central Committee was elected. As a result of both external repression and a failure to maintain internal unity, the movement did however degenerate into extreme sectarianism. Instead of popular armed struggle in the countryside, individual terrorism in Calcutta became a principal method of struggle. In 1971 Satyanarayan Singh revolted against the leadership, \\"individual killing of people branded as class enemy\\" and sectarianism of Majumdar. The result became that the party was split into two, one CPI (ML) led by Satyanarayan Singh and one CPI (ML) led by Majumdar. In 1972, frail and broken Majumdar died of multiple diseases in police custody; after his death a series of splits took place during the major part of the 1970s. The naxalite movement suffered a period of extremely harsh repression that rivaled the Dirty Wars of South America at the same time that the movement got all more fragmented. After Majumdar's death the CPI (ML) central committee split into pro- and anti-Majumdar factions. In December 1972 the Central Committee of the pro-Charu Majumdar CPI (ML) led by Sharma and Mahadev Mukherjee adopted resolution to follow the line of Charu Majumdar unconditionally which others did not agree to. The pro-Charu Majumdar CPI (ML) later split into pro- and anti-Lin Biao factions. The pro-Lin Biao faction became known as Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) (Mahadev Mukherjee) and the anti-Lin Biao- group later became known as Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) Liberation and was led by Jauhar, Vinod Mishra, Swadesh Bhattacharya. ==Legacy== Today, there exist a large number of political organizations whose roots are in the AICCCR/CPI (ML). Only C.P.I (M-L) faction led by Mahadev Mukherjee follows Charu Majumdar's concept of armed revolution and annihilation, whereas others have condemned the excesses of the sectarian epoch. All the organizations belonging to the later category have established legal overground structures (trade unions, student groups, peasant organisations, etc.) and started participating in elections. ===Splinter Groups=== Current parties and organizations with origins in CPI (ML) include *Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) Liberation led by Dipankar Bhattacharya *Communist Party of India (Maoist) *Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) Class Struggle *Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) Red Flag led by P.C.

The previous Amiga filesystem was never given a specific name and known originally simply as \\"DOS\\" or AmigaDOS. Upon the release of FFS, the original filesystem became known as Amiga Old File System (OFS). OFS, which was primarily designed for use with floppy disks, had been proving slow to keep up with hard drives of the era. FFS was designed as a full replacement for the original Amiga filesystem. FFS differs from its predecessor mainly in the removal of redundant information. Data blocks contain nothing but data, allowing the filesystem to manage the transfer of large chunks of data directly from the host adapter to the final destination. ==Characteristics== OFS was the predecessor to FFS. Before FFS was released, AmigaOS had a single filesystem simply called AmigaDOS: this uses 24 bytes per sector for redundancy data, providing for reconstructing structural data on less reliable media such as floppy disks. When higher-speed media (i.e. hard disks) became more available to the Amiga, this redundant data posed a bottleneck as all data needed to be realigned to be passed to the application. The redundancy was removed with FFS and the data read in from media are passed to the application directly. The previous filesystem, AmigaDOS, was renamed OFS, Old File System, to differentiate between it and FFS. FFS was backward-compatible and could access devices formatted with OFS. Given these advantages, FFS was rapidly adopted as the most common filesystem used by almost all Amiga users, although OFS continued to be widely used on floppy disks from third-party software vendors. (This was purely for compatibility with pre-AmigaOS 2 systems in games and applications that did not actually require AmigaOS 2+, as machines running earlier versions of the OS without FFS in the ROM could not boot from these floppies, although they could still read them if they had FFS installed.) Amiga FFS is simple and efficient, and when introduced was more than adequate, and had many advantages compared to the file systems of other platforms. However, as OFS had done before it, it aged; as drives became larger and the number of files on them increased, its use as a day-to-day filesystem became more problematic in terms of difficulty of maintenance and competitiveness of general performance. Despite this, it is still used on AmigaOS systems and shipped with both MorphOS and AmigaOS 4. By the last Commodore release of AmigaOS, 3.1, FFS was still the only filesystem shipped as standard with the Amiga, but it was already showing its age as technology advanced. FFS (and OFS) stores a \\"bitmap\\" of the filesystem in a single sector. On write, this is first marked as invalid, then the write is completed, then the bitmap is updated and marked as valid. If a write operation is interrupted by a crash or disk removal, this then allows the 'disk-validator' program to undo the damage. This resembled a very simple form of filesystem journaling. To allow the disk to be used again with an invalidated OFS or FFS filesystem, the entire disk has to be completely scanned and the bitmap rebuilt, but only the data being modified during the write would be lost. During this scanning the disk cannot be written to (except by the disk-validator as it performs its function), and read access is very slow. AmigaOS originally included a disk- validator on every bootable disk, which was prone to being replaced by viruses to allow themselves to spread (for example the \\"Saddam Hussein\\" virus). Later it became part of the ROM from Kickstart 2.x onwards, protecting it from malicious replacement. The disk-validator attempted to repair the bitmap on an invalidated drive by write-protecting the drive and scanning it; this could take a long time and made it very slow to access the disk until it was finished, especially on slower media. As hard drives got larger and contained more files, the validation process could take many hours. In addition, files and directories could feasibly be lost (often without the user being notified or even aware) during the process if their data hashes were corrupted. In some cases the validator could fail and leave the disk in a non-validated state, requiring the user to use a third-party disk tool like DiskSalv to make the volume writable again, or simply save the files by copying them to a fresh partition‚Äîa very slow process. FFS was also originally limited to 32-bit addressing and therefore about 4 GB drives, or at least the first 4 GB on a larger drive. Attempting to use FFS partitions beyond this limit caused serious data corruption all through the drive. FFS belatedly got some third- party 64-bit patches and then official (but non-Commodore) updates to allow it to circumvent these limitations. The latter were supplied with AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9, from Haage & Partner. The former often were supplied with third-party disk controllers, such as those from Phase5, where the ability to use large- capacity disks was a selling point. The two systems were not mutually compatible. In terms of support tools, although Commodore itself only shipped with an application called DiskDoctor (and later removed it from AmigaOS disks), FFS had a small selection of third-party tools‚Äîmost notably DiskSalv‚Äîto maintain the file system and repair and validate it, undelete files, or reverse \\"quick formats\\" (filesystem initializations). An OFS or FFS volume had to be locked to defragment or convert to different FFS modes to prevent corruption and this made it inaccessible to everything but the tool defragmenting it. Most of these tools were not updated when FFS became capable of 64-bit addressing and could only operate on partitions smaller than 4 GB; they could not read partitions bigger than 4 GB, and would generally corrupt partitions \\"beyond\\" the 4 GB boundary. When hard drives in use by Amiga users were reaching 4 GB in size, this became a problem. For all of these reasons, FFS was often replaced by users in the mid-1990s with more up-to-date alternatives such as Smart File System (SFS) and Professional File System (PFS), which did not have these limitations and were considered safer, faster and more efficient. SFS in particular continued to be developed and is now as close to a generic AmigaOS filesystem as FFS. ==History== FFS was introduced with version 1.3 of AmigaOS in 1988,1.3 release confirmed on September 16, 1988, by Carolyn Scheppner of CATS in amiga.dev in BIX. Copy of BIX announcement from USENET and replaced both the Kickstart ROM (or Kickstart floppy for A1000s) and Workbench floppy with updated software. It carried the version number of v34, like the rest of the AmigaOS 1.3 components. Kickstart 1.3 provided autobooting support so that the machine could now be booted from hard disk or reset-proof RAM disk (\\"RAD:\\"), whereas earlier Kickstart releases could only be booted from floppy disk. Workbench 1.3 provided the FFS filesystem device driver on disk, which could be copied into the Rigid Disk Block (RDB) on hard disks. Compliant block devices would then load and install the filesystem driver before filesystems were mounted and thus make it possible to use loadable filesystems on hard disks. Kickstart 1.2 could boot Workbench 1.3 from floppy (and vice versa), but it needed both Kickstart and Workbench 1.3 to autoboot FFS-formatted hard disks. FFS support was merged into the ROM-based filesystem from Kickstart 2.0 onwards, and so it was no longer necessary to install FFS in the RDB. The ability to load filesystems from the RDB still remained available in case one wished to fix ROM bugs, get new FFS features, or use a third-party filesystem. Floppies are unpartitioned devices without a RDB and also do not use the autobooting mechanism, so were only bootable if the disk's dostype was one the ROM-based filesystem understood. As a result, FFS-formatted floppies were not bootable until the release of Kickstart 2.0, and mounting them under Workbench 1.3 involved some ugly unsupported hacks. Similarly, \\"Directory Cache\\" variants were not bootable or supported until Kickstart 3.0. The various FFS flavours did not have any compatibility problems with Amiga software, even ones that were considered \\"system-unfriendly\\". Software would either use the system calls and thus work with any filesystem, or be \\"trackloaders\\" and not use a filesystem at all. FFS operated in several modes, defined by \\"dostypes\\". AmigaOS filesystems are identified by a four letter descriptor which is specified either in the RDB or a mountlist or dosdriver; alternatively (as was the case in trackdisk-like devices like floppy disks), the disk itself could be formatted in any dostype specified. FFS dostypes were as follows:AmigaOS user manual 3.1 DOS\\\\0: The original Amiga filesystem (OFS). This was left in for compatibility purposes, and the majority floppy disks shipped by software companies or as magazine coverdisks used this dostype so that they would boot on pre-2.x machines like the Amiga 500. It also meant that users with existing OFS-formatted drives could read them once they had installed FFS to the RDB. DOS\\\\1: The new filesystem, FFS. The first, disk-based releases of FFS did not have any additional modes. AmigaOS 2.04 made FFS (now v37) part of the Kickstart ROM and introduced new modes for handling international characters in filenames,All Amiga file systems can handle international characters but prior to the International versions they treated upper and lower cased letters as completely distinct characters. and for an on-disk directory cache. Each new mode was available with both OFS and FFS dostypes. This odd system was for parity: OFS modes apart from DOS\\\\0 were almost never used but were available nonetheless. (Although OFS, they were still not compatible with Amiga systems without FFS). The four new dostypes introduced with v37 of FFS: DOS\\\\2: \\"International\\" (OFS-INTL) mode allows OFS to handle filenames with \\"international characters\\" - i.e. those not found in English (Latin character set), such as √§ and √™. DOS\\\\3: International mode, for FFS (FFS-INTL). This was the most commonly used FFS mode. (All higher dostypes have international mode always enabled.) DOS\\\\4: \\"Directory Cache\\" (OFS-DC) mode enabled to primitive cache by creating dedicated directory lists instead of having to pick up the linked directory/file entries that lie scattered over the disk. A certain (small) amount of disk space to store the directory data is allocated. The DirCache option improved directory reading speed drastically but creating, deleting and renaming files became slower. It did not increase the speed of reading individual files. It became a popular choice on Amiga hard drives, but according to Olaf Barthel, author of FFS2, the use of dircache modes was probably better for floppy disks than it was for hard drives, where it would cause an overall degradation in performance compared to lack of dircache. Despite this it was rarely used on floppies, particularly because of the cache eating precious space, and because of the limited space preventing a large number of files to cache in the first place. The dircache mode lacks a \\"garbage collection\\" mechanism, which means that partly filled cache blocks are never consolidated and will keep taking up space. DOS\\\\5: Directory caching with FFS (FFS-DC). Both dircache modes were not backwards compatible with earlier versions of FFS. Version 40.1 was the last version of FFS released by Commodore, and came with AmigaOS 3.1, both on the OS disks and in the ROM. After this, several Unofficial patches appeared which allowed its use on drives after the first 2 GB of a hard disk using a 64-bit addressing system called TrackDisk64 or TD64 (although the 2 GB limit on file size and the 127 GB limit on partition sizes remained, as it was a limitation of AmigaOS dos.library and all then-current Amiga software) and carried the version number of v44. The version of FFS that came with AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9 was v45 and differed in that it used a different 64-bit addressing system, New Style Device or NSD. More recently (from 2003), MorphOS and AmigaOS 4 have introduced support for a slightly updated \\"FFS2\\", by Olaf Barthel (FFS v46, v50 respectively). This is compatible with the older FFS. It is PowerPC native, and introduced two more dostypes (which are not capable of being read by the older FFS): DOS\\\\6: \\"Long Filename\\" (OFS-LNFS). This allowed files to have a longer filename (up to 107 characters) than the usual Amiga limit, which was 31 characters. DOS\\\\7: Long filenames for FFS (FFS-LNFS). There were no directory caching modes available for LNFS dostypes, and International Mode was always enabled. Despite the ability to use the long filenames, by this time FFS compared very poorly to other available filesystems on the platforms it was available for. Apart from these extra dostypes, there are little or no functional difference between FFS and FFS2 (although some older non-specified bugs may have been dealt with) and should still not be used except for legacy purposes. Disk validation is still necessary in FFS2 (and may still result in data loss) just as it was on FFS, despite early beliefs to the contrary. ==Other implementations== There were few other implementations which are able to read FFS filesystems, which would normally require an Amiga emulator and a copy of the operating system ROMs to be read. Most notably, support for affs (Amiga Fast File System) can be compiled into Linux kernels, and offers full read, write and format support on FFS and OFS partitions of all dostypes except DOS\\\\6 and DOS\\\\7 (which are probably incredibly rare). On the Amiga, the freeware application xfshttp://de4.aminet.net/disk/misc/xfs.readme could, among many filesystems, read and write to devices formatted in OFS or FFS, and was probably the sole Amiga filesystem apart from FFS/FFS2 itself to do so. It did not support DOS\\\\6 or DOS\\\\7, which it predates, or formatting of devices. ==See also== *List of file systems *OFS *Professional File System *Smart File System ==References== ==External links== *The ADFlib Page and precisely ADF File specs *The ADF specs, in LHA format from Aminet Category:Disk file systems Category:Amiga Category:AmigaOS Category:MorphOS Category:File systems supported by the Linux kernel ","title":"Amiga Fast File System"},{"id":"844942","text":"The A80 is a road in Scotland, running from the A8 to Moodiesburn, north east of Glasgow.

It has now been superseded by the M80 motorway which roughly follows the route of the original A80. ==A80 / M80 Upgrade project== ===History=== The A80 gained a reputation for being one of Scotland's worst traffic bottlenecks. In 1992, the M80 Stepps bypass opened between the M8 and Stepps to relieve pressure on the road. This caused the M80 to lie in two parts with the A80 providing the link between the two sections: between the end of the Stepps bypass, and the 1974 section of the M80 which resumed at Haggs. The Stepps-Haggs stretch, built in the 1960s, was under-capacity in relation to the amount of traffic it carried, and the lack of hard shoulders meant that a vehicle breakdown potentially could cause massive jams === Auchenkilns roundabout upgrade === Despite long term plans to replace the Stepps-Haggs section with a completed M80, the troublesome Auchenkilns roundabout in Cumbernauld was replaced by a grade separated junction in 2005 as traffic congestion meant it could not wait for the final upgrade (which at that stage, was still in planning). A dumbbell interchange junction between the A80, A73 and B8048 was opened in November 2005, but the widely regarded long term solution to the A80's problems was to replace it entirely with a motorway which would bypass Cumbernauld completely. There was a scheme devised in the 1970s to do just that, which would have linked western segment of the M80, linking to the M8, to the eastern segment, where it connects to the A803 and M876, through what was known as the Kelvin Valley Route. === M80 Stepps to Haggs completion project === :See M80 motorway The Scottish Executive announced in 2002 that the A80 would be upgraded to Motorway standard, replacing the A80 from Stepps to Haggs with the M80. The Kelvin Valley route was not chosen as it would have breached the Antonine Wall and destroyed the Castlecary Roman fort; instead an on-line upgrade through Cumbernauld was selected. The upgrade was completed in September 2011. == References == Category:Roads in Scotland Category:Transport in Glasgow Category:Transport in North Lanarkshire Category:Transport in Stirling (council area) ","title":"A80 road (Scotland)"},{"id":"844943","text":"Perry Common is an area of north Birmingham that includes parts of both Stockland Green and Kingstanding.

In the 1840s, it was mentioned, then called The Quinton, that there were two small coal mines in the area and that the inhabitants were employed in nail manufacturing. Christ Church was constructed in 1840 at a cost of ¬£2,500. Though this area (including the Christ Church and its associated primary school) dates back to the Victorian era, and Quinton was formally removed from Worcestershire and incorporated into the county borough of Birmingham, in Warwickshire, on 9 November 1909; a tree was planted by Birmingham's Lord Mayor in Quinton Recreation Ground to commemorate the centenary. Quinton remained in character a village rather than a suburb until the large-scale private housing development of the 1930s. Factory developments were not planned for the area as a result of objections by residents of Edgbaston to the possibility of fumes being blown over to their area by the wind. The expanded Quinton of that time was fictionalised as \\"Tilton\\" by Francis Brett Young in his novel Mr & Mrs Pennington. Quinton became, with the rest of Birmingham, part of the metropolitan county of the West Midlands on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. ==Population and housing== The 2001 Population Census recorded that 23,084 people were living in Quinton. 14.5% (3,301) of the ward's population consisted of ethnic minorities compared with 29.6% for Birmingham. 71.7% of the population of Quinton stated Christianity as their religion. Much of Quinton's housing on the Ridgacre estate consists of medium- sized private semi-detached houses from the 1930s and 1940s. Construction of the housing estate was halted during World War II. In the 1950s, council houses typical of the period were built in the remaining spaces. There is a concentration of low-rise council housing on the Woodgate Valley estate, and higher-rise blocks on the Welsh House Farm estate, though this was designated until 2004 as part of Harborne. The older part of Quinton, the original Quinton village in the area around the C of E church on Hagley Road known as The Quinton, is built largely of Victorian terraced houses and contains, on High Street, the Nailers Cottage which is the oldest building in the area. The area is almost entirely residential, though there are typical small local service businesses and an office park has recently been developed on the Quinton Meadows site adjacent to the motorway. ==Politics== Quinton ward is currently represented by two Labour councillors on Birmingham City Council; Kate Booth, and former leader of the council John Clancy. The ward of Quinton forms part of Birmingham Edgbaston (UK Parliament constituency) along with Bartley Green, Edgbaston and Harborne, which has been represented by Labour Co-operative MP Preet Gill since 2017. ==Public services== Quinton has one secondary school, Four Dwellings Academy and five primary schools; Quinton C of E, Worlds End Primary School, Woodhouse Primary School, Welsh House Farm Community School and Four Dwellings Primary Academy. The area is served by Quinton Library. ==Sport== Quinton is home to two amateur football teams, Quinton Magpies and Quinton Rangers, both play in the Warley and District Football League. A healthy local rivalry has been built up over several years. ==Notable people== * Keith Law, songwriter for Velvett Fogg, lived in High Street. * Adrian Chiles * Bill Oddie * Joleon Lescott, grew up in Quinton and attended the Four Dwellings High School * The Twang, an indie band who were formed in Quinton. * Elliot Knight, British actor best known for his role as Aiden Walker in How To Get Away With Murder. ==References== ==External links== * Birmingham City Council: Quinton Ward * The History of Quinton Category:Areas of Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Wards of Birmingham, West Midlands ","title":"Quinton, Birmingham"},{"id":"844962","text":"Shard End is an area of Birmingham, England. It is also a ward within the formal district of Hodge Hill. Shard End borders Castle Bromwich to the north and Kingshurst to the east which are situated in the northern part of the neighbouring Metropolitan Borough of Solihull. ==History== ===Pre-War=== Before the end of World War II, Shard End was completely rural with the only buildings being farmhouses, farm outbuildings and tithe cottages. Shard End's most infamous resident was Abraham Thornton, son of the owner of Shard End Farm (then part of the Coleshill estate). He was charged with the murder of a local girl, Mary Ashford, in 1817. The events of the trial led to the abolition of two ancient legal rights ‚Äì the right of a close relative to demand another trial although the defendant had been acquitted, and the right of a defendant to defend himself by challenging the relative to a duel. The duel did not take place and Thornton left the area soon after his second trial to travel to the US. During World War I, much of the woodland between Shard End and Kingshurst had been cut down to help with the war effort. The Birmingham and District Association of Boy Scouts were able to buy a patch of land at a bargain price and set up a permanent camp there. This land was half way between Kingshurst and Shard End. It was called Yorkswood and opened in 1923. There were five camp fields, covering an area of . The total site was over . The site benefited from permanent washhouses and latrines, a swimming pool, a training centre and headquarters, guesthouse, warden's hut and other huts. A small brook from a fresh water spring ran past the camp and Cock Sparrow Farm was about away to provide fresh milk. The entrance to the camp was flanked by a series of griffin statues. These had come from the roof of Lewis's Department Store in Birmingham when it was being renovated. After the camp closed in 1972 they were placed upon the Yorkswood housing estate (Kendrick Avenue and nearby roads) in Shard End, built upon the site of the camp. Yorkswood takes its name from the nearby Yorks Wood, an eleven hectare forest dating back hundreds of years. In the inter war years the Midland Sand and Gravel Company operated a mine on what is now the Norman Chamberlain Playing Fields, off Packington Avenue. During World War II, this gravel pit was used to store and repair third-line tanks. After the war the area was landscaped to become the playing fields. The old gravel pit was allowed to fill with water from a natural spring to form Shard End Lake and has become a leisure facility. ===The new estate=== A plan of the new housing estate was produced at the end of 1945 and compulsory purchase orders were issued in 1946. Building of the estate started in the late 1940s and was added to in stages producing some variety in the housing. As usual, communal facilities lagged behind the building of the housing. Nine tower blocks were constructed in the ward. As a result of the construction of the estate, plans for a new church were drawn up. In 1954, construction of All Saints Church,All Saints Church a traditional Church of England church, began and construction was completed in 1955. Designed by F J Osbourne, it was the first new church to be built in Birmingham after World War II. On 1 November 1955, the Lord Bishop of Birmingham, Leonard Wilson, consecrated the church. This was followed by a visit by Queen Elizabeth II two days later. Nikolaus Pevsner, an architect and writer, disapproved of the building calling it \\"a very ugly church\\".Brief history of All Saints Church Shard End Library opened in 1967 and was the first in Birmingham to use plastic membership cards instead of the traditional cardboard tickets. Some of the housing deteriorated in later years, but has improved as tenants have bought their homes. ===Development in the 1970s=== After the estate of the 1940s had been constructed, a large swathe of green land remained along the River Cole valley, this was called 'The cow fields' although there was no evidence they were ever used for pasture. This rare open space in a city provided valuable recreation space for the new and young population of Shard End. During the late 1970s, however, this tract of land was almost completely built upon and the area lost much of its charm. Since the building of this development, and a sharp decline in employment levels during the 1980s, Shard End has seen a marked increase in the problems typical of urban areas in large cities. ==Shard End 1990s== All Saints Church (Anglican) is situated in Coneyford Road. It was opened by the Queen in 1955. It has the distinction of being the first Church of England church to be built and consecrated after the war, anywhere in the country. There is also a Methodist and a Baptist church. Shard End has its own community Centre on Packington Avenue, on the opposite side of the road to the Police Station. At one time, this station had the largest meeting room in the police sub division. There is a shopping area, crown post office and surgery on Shard End Crescent. Cole Hall Farm was derelict for a number of years but has now been converted into a pub. There are four primary and two secondary schools. The River Cole, a tributary of the River Tame, runs through Shard End, into Kingshurst. It forms the heart of the Kingfisher Country Park. The local library hosts the Shard End Local History Group once every month. In January 2005, work on replacing a derelict petrol station with a community centre began. The building is a result of a partnership between Birmingham City Council and GOWM. Thomas Vale Construction are building the community centre.Advantage West Midlands: Success Stories ‚Äì Shard End Community Centre ==Shard End today== In January 2013, work was completed on All Saints Square aiming to improve a deprived area of the city, housing a new Library, Birmingham City Council office and Shard End Post Office, alongside a number of other businesses. The development includes a large onsite car park with local bus services running through the area. The project included the construction of a number of new homes and apartments undertaken in partnership with Barratt Developments and Greswoulde construction. 75.6% of Shard End voters chose to Leave during the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. This was the highest of any ward in Birmingham. ==Demographics== According to the 2001 Population Census there were 23,154 people living in Shard End with a population density of 3,817 people per km¬≤ compared with 3,649 people per km¬≤ for Birmingham. The area is not an ethnically diverse community with ethnic minorities representing 7.9% (1,820) of the ward's population compared with 29.6% for Birmingham in general. ==Transport== The area is served by Lea Hall railway station on the Coventry to Birmingham New Street line with occasional services to Walsall via Aston railway station. It is served by the number 55 bus route. ==Notable people== Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra grew up in a council house at 368 Shard End Crescent in Shard End.Brumbeat: The biography of 'The Andicaps' The lyrics to the ELO song \\"All Over the World\\" mention Shard End along with cities like London, Paris, Amsterdam, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo. Roger Taylor (drummer of Duran Duran) also lived at 350 Shard End Crescent until the age of 11 and attended Timberley Lane School. ==References== ==External links== *Birmingham City Council: Shard End Ward Category:Areas of Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Wards of Birmingham, West Midlands ","title":"Shard End"},{"id":"844965","text":"WXKS (1200 AM) ‚Äì branded Talk 1200 ‚Äì is a commercial news/talk radio station licensed to Newton, Massachusetts, serving the Greater Boston area. Owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., WXKS serves as the Boston affiliate for Fox News Radio, The Glenn Beck Program, The Rush Limbaugh Show, The Sean Hannity Show, The Buck Sexton Show and The Mark Levin Show; and the home of syndicated personalities Clay Travis, Bill Handel, Ron Wilson, Gary Sullivan and Leo Laporte. The WXKS studios are located in the Boston suburb of Medford, while the station transmitter resides in Newton. Besides its main analog transmission, WXKS streams online via iHeartRadio. ==History== ===WKOX (AM)=== On April 21, 1947, the station signed on as WKOX, a daytime-only station on 1190 kHz in Framingham.Broadcasting Yearbook 1948 page 144 WKOX would be paired with an FM adjunct, WKOX-FM (105.7), on February 10, 1960. Fairbanks Communications purchased WKOX and WKOX-FM in 1970. In 1985, WKOX switched frequencies to 1200 kHz and received authorization to broadcast around the clock. For many years, WKOX functioned as a full service station oriented towards the MetroWest region. Following stints with satellite-fed oldies and talk radio, WKOX became a partial simulcast of their FM sister station, then known as country- formatted WCLB (105.7 FM), on March 1, 1993. The only deviation from this simulcast was morning drive, which continued to be programmed separately. That August, WKOX switched to ABC Radio/Satellite Music Network's \\"Real Country\\" format, featuring classic country to complement the more contemporary country sound on WCLB. (subscription content preview) Another attempt at talk, including a show hosted by former WEEI (590 AM) and WRKO host Gene Burns, was made on October 2, 1995. By this point, WKOX had begun to orient itself to the Boston market as a whole rather than MetroWest. (subscription content preview) WKOX's talk format was replaced with brokered programming on October 1996, mostly consisting of ethnic and foreign language shows. Notably, Contemporary Christian music station WJLT (1060 AM) leased out WKOX's overnight hours to extend its programming schedule, since WJLT was bound at the time to daytime- only operations. As early as 1995, WKOX pursued options to upgrade its power and serve the entire Boston area. The FCC approved plans to have the station change its city of license to Newton and move their transmitter site to a site also utilized by WUNR, where it would operate at 50,000 watts. Community opposition delayed this series of moves for nearly 13 years, and also significantly delayed attempts by Fairbanks Communications to divest WKOX. While Westinghouse Broadcasting and B-Mass Holding Company had expressed interest, by 1998, WKOX was the last remaining radio station in the Fairbanks portfolio. After Richard M. Fairbanks died in August 2000, WKOX was finally sold a few months later to Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia). The brokered format, by then primarily consisting of Spanish-language religious programming, was retained until 2004, when the station began simulcasting a progressive talk format with the original WXKS (1430 AM). Both stations switched to a Spanish tropical format, branded as \\"Rumba\\", on December 21, 2006. WKOX completed the transmitter/city of license move to Newton in the fall of 2008, and began broadcasting at 50,000 watts full-time in April 2009. That September 4, WXKS (1430 AM) broke from the WKOX simulcast and flipped to a Spanish adult hits format, branded as \\"Mia 1430\\". === WXKS (2010‚Äìpresent) === alt= Clear Channel announced in January 2010 that WKOX would once again change to a talk format in April, the launch was stepped up to March 8 after WRKO dropped The Rush Limbaugh Show from its line-up. With this format change, WKOX changed call letters to WXKS (AM) that March 1; WXKS (1430 AM) concurrently changed their calls to WKOX. Coast to Coast AM was the first talk program to air on the station, moving from WRKO in February 2010, several weeks before the full format change. \\"Rumba\\" programming ceased on March 5, at which time the station began stunting. For the first year of the talk format, WXKS was branded as \\"Rush Radio 1200\\", named for Limbaugh; similar branding was utilized at WRNO-FM/New Orleans, WRDU/Raleigh-Durham, and WPTI/Greensboro, North Carolina. Less than a year later, on February 28, 2011, WXKS re-branded itself as \\"Talk 1200 Boston.\\" Original \\"Talk 1200 Boston\\" logo. Local hosts Jeff Katz and Jay Severin were both dismissed from WXKS on August 6, 2012, Katz was reassigned to then-co-owned WRVA/Richmond, Virginia, while Severin joined TheBlaze Radio Network; that same day, both Rush Limbaugh and Coast to Coast AM returned to WRKO's lineup. For the next four days, WXKS continued with the remainder of their syndicated programming before stunting with a 10-minute loop of political gaffes; this led into a format switch to comedy radio that August 13 as the Boston affiliate for 24/7 Comedy Radio.

On February 27, 2013, Clear Channel announced that WXKS would begin to carry Bloomberg Radio's financial news and information programming as of March 1. The comedy format continued on the HD2 channel of WXKS-FM until December 2013. The simulcast of 1200 AM, which had previously been on 107.9-HD2, moved to the HD2 subchannel of WJMN, replacing old-school hip hop. In September 2013, WXKS began broadcasting Harvard University football, men's hockey, and men's basketball games. The broadcasts would be produced by an independent packager who would pay for the airtime. Bloomberg L.P. announced on July 3, 2017 that the following day, Bloomberg Radio would move its programming to WRCA and its FM translator at 106.1 MHz. WXKS continued to simulcast the Bloomberg programming for several months. After Bloomberg's local marketing agreement with WXKS ended on March 1, 2018, the station took on the conservative talk programming that had been on WKOX, including Rush Limbaugh. WXKS also returned to the \\"Talk 1200\\" branding.iHeartMedia Relaunches Talk 1200 and Rumba 1430 Boston Radioinsight - March 1, 2018 WKOX returned to a tropical music format and was moved into a trust ownership, and would later eventually donated to Delmarva Educational Association. ==ReferencesCategory:Radio stations established in 1947 XKS (AM) Category:Newton, Massachusetts Category:Mass media in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:Talk radio stations in the United States Category:1947 establishments in Massachusetts Category:IHeartMedia radio stations ","title":"WXKS (AM)"},{"id":"844967","text":"Short Heath is an area of Birmingham, England near to Erdington.

It is the smallest butterfly in this subfamily. The small heath is diurnal and flies with a noticeable fluttering flight pattern near the ground. It rests with closed wings when not in flight.Wickman, Per- Clof. ‚ÄúThe Influence of Temperature on the Territorial and Mate Locating Behaviour of the Small Heath Butterfly, Coenonympha Pamphilus (L.) (Lepidoptera: Satyridae).‚Äù Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, vol. 16, no. 3, 1985, pp. 233‚Äì238., doi:10.1007/bf00310985. It is widespread in colonies throughout the grasslands of Eurasia and north-western Africa, preferring drier habitats than other Coenonympha, such as salt marshes, alpine meadows, wetlands, and grasslands near water (i.e. streams). However, habitat loss caused by human activities has led to a decline in populations in some locations. The larval host plants are grasses, found in various habitats, while adult butterflies feed on nectar from flowers. The males of this species are territorial, which plays a large role in obtaining a female mate. To establish dominance, they partake in lekking, a mating display in which males aggregate in a competitive display to attract passing females. == Taxonomy == The small heath is one of 40 species classified within the genus Coenonympha and placed in the family Nymphalidae. It belongs to the tribe Satyrini and its Coenonymphina subtribe. The small heath was first described in 1758 by Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish botanist and zoologist, in his book Systema Naturae. Originally, the female C. pamphilus butterfly was referred to as the Golden Heath Eye and the male as the Selvedged Heath Eye. Entomologist Moses Harris later described it as the Small Heath or the Gatekeeper. However, the Gatekeeper now describes the Pyronia tithonus. ==Description in Seitz== C. pamphilus. Small butterflies which on the upper side are the colour of reddish yellow sand. Forewing beneath reddish yellow, bordered with grey and bearing a small pupilled apical ocellus; hindwing diluted with grey, with a shortened, curved, whitish median band shaded with brown. The ocelli are generally completely absent or only indicated by faint and indistinct vestiges of dots or rings. ‚Äî The ground-colour of the hindwing of the Northern form, pamphilus L. (= nephele Hbn., menaleas Poda, gardetta Loche) (48 g) is mouse grey beneath; it is the only form in the North, and extends throughout North and Central Europe to Anterior Asia, Turkestan, Ferghana and Persia. ‚Äî In ab. bipupillata Cosm. the apical ocellus is greatly enlarged and doubly pupilled. ‚Äî marginata Stgr. (48 g) has a very broad dark distal margin on all the wings, but its underside resembles that of lyllus. (A broadening of the blackish distal margin occurs in the summer brood in many localities.) ‚Äî lyllus Esp. is the summer form from Southern Europe, North Africa and the southern part of Anterior Asia. In this form the wings are broader, the apex of the forewing is more rounded, the margin of the hindwing often undulating, the underside of the hindwing not mouse-grey but also sandy yellow with a fine, curved, median line. ‚Äî In thyrsides Stgr. (48 g), from Sicily-, Dalmatia and the southern portion of Anterior Asia, of which I also found typical specimens in the valleys of the Atlas, the hindwing on both sides bears a submarginal row of ocelli, which are sometimes pupilled. ‚Äî Larva bright green with a thin, double, white dorsal stripe and yellow lateral one. Head pale green; throughout the summer on grasses.Pupa stout, green, with darker markings. The butterflies are the commonest Satyrids in the whole of Europe and are on the wing from the end of April until October, everywhere on meadows and fallow fields, cornfields and bare summits of hills. They almost fly only when disturbed, and soon settle again, affecting roads and bare patches of ground, sometimes inclining their always closed wings to one side. Their flight is jumping, slow, and low. They even fly into the towns, wandering over gardens and yards, and one sometimes sees them hopping along on paved streets for traffic, and settling for a moment on the pavement.Seitz.

Band 1: Abt. 1, Die Gro√üschmetterlinge des palaearktischen Faunengebietes, Die palaearktischen Tagfalter, 1909, 379 Seiten, mit 89 kolorierten Tafeln (3470 Figuren) === Subspecies === Subspecies of the Coenonympha pamphilus include:\\"Coenonympha H√ºbner, [1819]\\" at Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and Some Other Life Forms * C. p. lyllus (Esper, 1806) (southern Europe and Siberia, the Crimea, the Caucasus and Transcaucasia) * C. p. marginata Heyne, [1894] (southern Europe and Siberia, the Crimea, the Caucasus and Transcaucasia) * C. p. fulvolactea Verity (1926) (middle Asia) * C. p. centralasiae Verity (1926) (middle Asia) * C. p. infrarasa Verity (1926) (middle Asia) * C. p. juldusica Verity (1926) (middle Asia) * C. p. ferghana Stauder (1924) (middle Asia) * C. p. nitidissima Verity (1924) (middle Asia) * C. p. asiaemontium Verity (1924) (Altai Mountains) * C. p. rhoumensis Harrison (1948) === Similar species === The butterfly loosely resembles a small meadow brown, but the brown of the wings appears noticeably paler in flight. Unlike the meadow brown and other common members of the subfamily Satyrinae, the small heath is a lateral basker, only ever resting with its wings closed and angled at 90¬∞ to the sun. It more closely resembles Coenonympha caeca (forewing without apical spots), Coenonympha tullia (forewing apical spot smaller), and Coenonympha symphita (underside of hindwing without white spot and almost always with a complete row of spots on the forewing). == Distribution and habitat == thumb222x222px A semi-natural grassland in Europe The small heath is spread throughout the Western Palearctic, particularly in Europe where it has been reported in at least 40 different countries since 2002. It is commonly found in the United Kingdom, largely in England and Wales. Populations are also found in southwest Siberia, regions of Asia, and north Africa. As a grasslands species, the small heath prefers open habitats with shorter grass compared to other related species. It is also found in an extensive range of environments including meadows, heaths, mountains (in the subalpine zone), and alongside railways. It has been sighted in calcareous grasslands throughout nineteen countries in Europe. For mating and oviposition, small heath butterflies prefer territories that are close to vegetation over areas that are open and clear. The small heath also resides in biodiverse patches of green habitats (i.e. greenways, gardens, and parks) in urban areas. These fragments create less-isolated corridors throughout cities, which help butterflies disperse throughout this habitat. == Food resources == === Caterpillars === 238x238px The primary food resources for small heath larvae are different varieties of grass species. These include the Anthoxanthum odoratum, Poa pratensis, Agrostis stolonifera, and Festuca rubra, which commonly appear on some calcerous grasslands. === Adults === Yarrow, a food resource for adult small heath233x233px Adult small heath butterflies feed on floral nectar of a variety of flowers such as bramble, yarrow, and ragwort. This nectar has a high content of minerals and nutrients (particularly amino acids and sugar), and is highly important for male and female butterfly reproductive success. == Parental care == === Oviposition === The small heath is a plurivoltine butterfly, having multiple generations in a year. Oviposition varies throughout the lifespan of a female small heath. The rate of oviposition is high for young females, particularly at the beginning of their reproductive life, while older females eventually lay fewer and yellower eggs. === Host plant selection for egg laying === Small heath females prefer to lay eggs in grassland. They use a biological adhesive to lay its eggs directly onto host plants, plants near host plants, or wilting leaves. If the eggs are laid on or near host plants, the larvae are able to feed on the host plant. If attached to the dead grasses, they are forced to find their own food immediately after hatching. == Life cycle == 370x370px === Eggs === Small heath eggs are round and sometimes laid on blades of grass. The eggs are occasionally in clusters, but usually alone. Initially, the egg is a light green with a slight depression on the top and an overall ridged texture. It later gains a white hue with a brown band wrapped around the middle and irregular brown speckles on the surface. Egg color and weight changes throughout a female's lifespan. Younger females initially tend to lay heavier, greener eggs at a higher frequency. These eggs then transition to an intermediate green-yellow color. After about 100 eggs are laid, or near the end of their lifespans, older females lay lighter, yellow eggs. Adult small heath butterflies have at least one or usually two broods of offspring depending on environmental factors (such as location and altitude). === Larvae === Butterflies like the small heath typically undergo multiple stages of development called instars, through which the insect grows noticeably larger in size. The small heath typically goes through four instars and molts three times. The third instar signals a diapause in which the larva hibernates. By the end of the fourth instar, the small heath larvae are a leafy green color with a green stripe running along its back and stripes a lighter shade of green on its sides. It has pink anal points, a protrusion at the end of the caterpillar. Larvae will sometimes undergo a fifth instar and enter diapause, which possibly signals an adapted response to environmental factors (primarily temperature). In diapause, the larva's resources are used to reinforce and strengthen its already-existing larval adult structures. These larvae then develop into larger male and smaller female pupae. === Pupae === The small heath remains in the pupae stage for approximately 3 weeks. The color of the chrysalis fully develops in four days. The pupa is light yellow-green and suspends from a plant stem with the head facing downward. The cremaster is a series of hooks at the rear of the pupa, which allows it to hang from the stem. The pupae is thick and has a length of 8.5 mm. It is slightly curved with dark dorsal stripes around the sides and light-yellow bumps on the abdomen. The wing covers along the side are a white pigment with small accents of red-brown. === Adult === Top and bottom views of the small heath wingspan The wings of an adult small heath butterfly are light brown. Males are darker and sometimes have gray-brown hues, while females are paler and occasionally a white-brown or yellow-white color. Other variations include a redder or yellower pigment with the occasional purple-brown color. Both males and females can have a brownish-gray border circling the edge of the wing. This border varies in thickness and appears to be more common in males than in females. The forewing can have a prominent or faint dark spot or, sometimes, no spot at all near the wing tip. The hindwings may also have eyespots or white dots. A white band runs along the underside of the wing and varies in width and fullness. Female small heath butterflies have a wingspan of 37 mm and tend to be larger than males, which have a wingspan of 33 mm. The small heath is diurnal, or is active in the daytime. It flies near the ground with a fluttering flight pattern. Small heaths are also lateral baskers, angling their bodies 90¬∞ to the sun with their wings closed when resting.

Males with their own territories are more likely to mate successfully with females. This prompts aggressive male behavior between stationary males and wandering males who may contest territory ownership. The stationary male sometimes engages the wandering male in an attempt to determine its sex, and these interactions remain short to reduce vulnerability to predation. Longer interactions between males are typically territorial disputes. Larger males are typically more successful in territorial disputes with other males, as they have longer wing spans and are superior in size and weight to smaller males. Thus, larger males have a significantly higher chance of successfully mating a female. Temperature plays a role in male-male interactions as well. Both females and males increase vagrancy with increased temperatures, and vice versa. In low-temperature conditions, it is advantageous for a male to remain stationary in order to defend his territory as a potential mating site. This leads to longer male-male interactions when territorial disputes are more likely to occur. However, when temperatures are high, choosing not to defend territory is the preferred and advantageous strategy in mating. This is because males who become vagrant will have a higher chance of intercepting a wandering female in competition with other vagrant males. This leads to shorter male-male interactions as males are not defending territory. === Interactions between males and females === Mating pair of small heaths ==== Mate choice ==== Male small heath butterflies find mates either by defending their ownership of a territory or by drifting in search for a female. Virgin females also spend time in the air to find a potential mate, but females who have already mated avoid claimed territories. Due to its longer lifespan, virgin females seek mates less urgently than, for example, females of the C. tullia species. Virgin small heaths females will allow males to pass by instead of seeking them out to begin courtship. They choose to perform a long, elaborate zig-zag flight pattern to draw attention after they reach a group of perching males, who will take part in lekking as a show of dominance. The female then selectively chooses her mate and begins a monandrous relationship. Most matings occur with residents within territories than with the wandering non-residents. Females often mate with males with larger wings, as territory owners are usually larger, and generally mate only once or twice in their short overall lifetimes. ==== Lekking ==== Male small heaths aggregate and form leks often around bushes or trees, creating an elaborate visual display to attract a female's attention. The female will approach by circling the lek, which attracts the males' attention more than being stationary. There are both costs and benefits of lekking for the female. Females benefit by typically mating with the dominant male and producing offspring with beneficial, heritable genes, as a result of their free choice in mates. They also have increased survival and maintained health because males cannot force the females to copulate. A few fitness costs include lost time to obtain more resources, risk of mortality through predation, and less time for oviposition, which all lead to decreased fecundity. The leks themselves do not contain resources for the females. ==== Copulation ==== Copulation between male and female small heath butterflies lasts between 10 minutes and 5 hours, occurring at any time in the day. In 1985, a study observed that males often mate within their own territory (86.7% of 30 matings), and these copulations are generally lengthy, lasting over 100 minutes. Otherwise, copulations lasted approximately 10‚Äì30 minutes, especially for vagrant males. The study also found that either the male or female (but generally the male) is forced to leave the territory after copulation. ==== Nuptial gifts ==== During copulation, male small heath butterflies transfer a nuptial gift to a female in the form of a spermatophore, which contains both additional nutrients and sperm. Males can use amino acids found in nectar from food resources to help produce these spermatophores, which are then passed to the female when reproducing. The spermatophore increases female fitness and aids female performance in reproduction, and its nutrients are also assimilated later into the eggs that are laid, leading to heavier larvae. == Thermoregulation == Small heath butterflies typically live well in dry, open landscapes with higher temperatures, in comparison to other species of satyrine butterflies. When temperatures are significantly high, lifespan is shortened but the small heath will fare better than shade-dwelling species, such as the speckled wood, Pararge aegeria. Like other butterflies, it has a small range of optimum temperatures and can regulate its temperatures in a small variety of ways, such as positioning its body to maximally absorb sunlight. In high temperature habitats, the small heath produces eggs at a relatively high rate, has good fecundity, and survives well as compared to woodland butterflies. Male butterflies will also tend to drift and be vagrant in their search for females rather than perch in their territories and wait, as they would do in optimum or sub-optimum temperatures. == Threats == === Parasitism === Trogus lapidatorThe Trogus lapidator (parasitic wasp) and other varieties of Ichneumoninae species will often parasitize Lepidoptera pupae as parasitoids. The parasite eventually emerges from the host pupae as an adult by slicing out a cap at the terminal end of the chrysalis and breaking through. In small heath pupae, staining can sometimes be seen around the cut site of the cap. === Interactions with humans === As a grassland species, the effects of intense, widespread agriculture is a concern for the welfare of the small heath. Grassland management through periodic ecological disturbances (i.e. mowing) is considered necessary to maintain ‚Äúsemi-natural‚Äù grasslands. Negative effects of mowing include the loss of biodiversity, the conversion of natural grasslands into agricultural fields, mortality, and loss of nectar resources. However, a study shows that such disturbances of these habitats may actually lead to an increase in the population of grassland butterflies including the small heath. == Conservation == Overall, the small heath is generally common and abundant throughout its geographic distribution, particularly in Europe. Urban habitats have become a significant focus in the conservation of the small heath due to the widespread green fragments forming chains of ecological biodiversity. In a study of elevated atmospheric CO2 levels on development, it was determined that larval development time increased due to elevated CO2 levels, suggesting an effect of CO2 on larval performance. Additionally, it was found that food-plant preferences of larvae might also be affected, which could play a future evolutionary role, although this is an area that requires further research. === Status in the Netherlands === In the Netherlands, the distribution of the Coenonympha tullia is significantly reduced as a result of climate change. Also satyrine species of the genus Coenonympha, the C. hero and C. arcania have gone extinct. One study shows that the small heath has adapted well to climate change and will continue to survive because it can adapt biologically to altered environments. In response to these environmental changes (i.e. temperature), the small heath can overwinter in diapause, which promotes its survival through rapid development. ===Status in England=== The small heath, like its cousin the wall brown, has been in serious decline across much of southern England for reasons unclear, and was accordingly designated as a UK Biodiversity Action Plan Priority Species (research only) by DEFRA in 2007. These butterflies typically live in colonies, which have been negatively impacted by construction, human development, and general habitat loss in recent years. In 2007, the IUCN category status listed the small heath as near threatened. ==References== ==External links== * Butterfly Conservation species page * Images of small heath * Small heath, Moths and Butterflies of Europe and North Africa Category:Coenonympha Category:Butterflies of Africa Category:Butterflies of Asia Category:Butterflies of Europe Category:Butterflies of Turkey Category:Butterflies described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Endangered species of the British Isles ","title":"Small heath (butterfly)"},{"id":"844975","text":"Title page of a private souvenir album created collectively by the members of the Harriman Alaska Expedition. The Harriman Alaska expedition explored the coast of Alaska for two months from Seattle to Alaska and Siberia and back again In 1899. It was organized by wealthy railroad magnate Edward Harriman. Harriman brought with him an elite community of scientists, artists, photographers, and naturalists to explore and document the Alaskan coast. ==The genesis of the voyage== Edward Harriman was one of the most powerful men in America and controlled several railroads. By early 1899, he was exhausted. His doctor told him that he needed a long vacation. Harriman went to Alaska to hunt Kodiak bears. Rather than go alone, he took a scientific community to explore and document the coast of Alaska. He contacted Clinton Hart Merriam, the head of the Division of Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy at the United States Department of Agriculture, and one of the founders of the National Geographic Society. Harriman told Merriam that he would cover the expenses of scientists, artists, and other experts who would join the voyage. He asked Merriam to choose the scientific party. Historians question why Harriman wanted to go to Alaska. Some think he was considering developing Alaskan resources. Some think he was considering building a railroad to the Alaskan territory. Some people at the time openly wondered if he was going to buy Alaska, or build a railroad bridge from Alaska to Siberia ‚Äî a railroad around the world. Nothing seemed impossible for Edward H. Harriman.Chowder, K. \\"North to Alaska\\". Smithsonian Monthly. June, 2003. Merriam held a flurry of meetings and sent many telegrams. He organized a broad range of experts: arctic experts, botanists, biologists and zoologists, geologists and geographers, artists, photographers, ornithologists and writers. Harriman had the steamship SS George W. Elder refitted for the expedition. The remodeled ship featured lecture rooms, a library with over 500 volumes on Alaska, a stable for animals, taxidermy studios, and luxury rooms for the team. Some on the expedition referred to her as the George W. Roller, for its tendency to roll at sea, causing seasickness among the passengers. ==Participants== Expedition members posed on the beach at Cape Fox Village, Alaska, 1899 The members of the interdisciplinary team included many of the best American scientists, artists, and photographers of the time.

The Harriman Alaska expedition; Narrative, glaciers, natives; Volume I. New York: Doubleday, Page & Company ==The Voyage== By the end of May, the ship's guests and passengers had all arrived in Seattle. Newspapers around the world ran front-page stories about the trip. The Elder left Seattle on 31 May 1899. Cheering crowds saw them off. Their first stop was the Victoria Museum on Vancouver Island. They then traveled farther north to Lowe Inlet, where they stopped to explore and document the wildlife. On 4 June, they stopped in Metlakatla, the European-style settlement that was created by Scottish missionary William Duncan for the Alaskan indigenous people. The scientists visited with Duncan in his home. In the next two weeks the Elder stopped at several spots on Alaskan soil, including Skagway and Sitka. They saw the results, both positive and negative, of the Klondike Gold Rush. They continued to catalog plants, animals, and marine creatures, as well as geological and glacial formations. Harriman had brought a graphophonic recording machine, and used it to record a native Tlingit song. By 25 June, they had reached Prince William Sound. They discovered an undocumented fjord in the northwest corner of the Sound. They named it \\"Harriman Fjiord.\\" While the scientists had some control over where they stopped to explore, Harriman retained the final judgment. He was anxious to hunt a bear, and he decided to head toward Kodiak Island when he heard that there were bears there. On 7 July, they reached Popof Island in the Shumagin Islands. Four of the scientists, Ritter, Saunders, Palache, and Kincaid (accompanied by guide Luther Kelly), decided to camp on Popof Island while the rest of the scientists continued on to Siberia. This allowed them to make much more detailed notes about the area, rather than quick notes on frequent stops along the way. Edward Harriman‚Äôs wife wanted to put her feet on Siberian soil, so the Elder continued northward. By 11 July, the ship had put into Plover Bay in Siberia. Harriman, by this time, was impatient and ready to get back to work. The Elder steamed southward, picking up the party on Popof Island. On 26 July, the Elder made one last stop, at an abandoned Tlingit village at Cape Fox. On July 30, the ship pulled into Seattle. ==Expedition publications== Harriman paid for the creation of several sizable volumes of the discoveries of the expedition. When Harriman died in 1909, his wife provided additional money to continue the publications. Merriam served as the editor, and spent twelve years working on the publications.Goetzmann, W.H. & Sloan, K. (1982). Looking far north: The Harriman expedition to Alaska, 1899. New York: The Viking Press. John Burroughs, a best-selling nature author, was the official scribe of the expedition. He wrote much of Volume I, an overview of the trip. Volumes VI and VII, which were to be written by Merriam and feature mammals, never appeared. Perhaps Merriam simply couldn‚Äôt find the time with his other duties. Subsequent volumes were written by other expedition scientists or authors hired by Merriam to finish the work. While they often mentioned the beauty and grandeur of the Alaskan coast, the publications were mostly highly technical and written for other scientists. The first volume was published in 1901, and they continued to be published in the next few years. The Smithsonian republished the entire series in 1910, and the volumes are now available as free downloads. * ** Vol I: Narrative, Glaciers, Natives ** Vol II: History, Geography, Resources ** Vol III: Glaciers and Glaciation ** Vol IV: Geology and Paleontology ** Vol V: Cryptogamic Botany ** Vol VIII: Insects, Part 1 ** Vol IX: Insects, Part 2 ** Vol X: Crustaceans ** Vol XI: Nemerteans, Bryozoans ** Vol XII: Enchytraeids, Tubicolous Annelids ** Vol XIII: Land and Fresh Water Mollusks ** Vol XIV: Monograph of the Shallow-water Starfishes of the North Pacific Coast from the Arctic Ocean to California, Part 1. Text and Part 2. Plates ==Accomplishments== The expedition claimed to have discovered some 600 species that were new to science, including 38 new fossil species. They charted the geographic distribution of many species. They discovered an unmapped fjord and named several glaciers. Gilbert‚Äôs work on glaciers represented new thinking in the field. Another legacy of the trip was the career of Edward Curtis. On the trip, he developed a close friendship with George Grinnell, who was an expert on Native American culture. After the expedition, Grinnell invited Curtis with him on a trip to the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana. Curtis, moved by what was commonly believed to be a dying way of life, spent much of his career documenting Native American culture. At first, John Muir found Harriman distasteful and his hunting barbaric. But, over the course of the trip and afterward, the two became friends. Years later, Muir recruited Harriman to help with governmental lobbying on National Park legislation. It was Muir who gave the eulogy at Harriman‚Äôs funeral in 1909. In many ways, the expedition was an intersection of 19th-century science and 20th-century science. It often represented the best of the new century‚Äôs science, but it also showed how scientists thought in the previous century. They foreshadowed practices of 20th-century science by being a truly interdisciplinary team. The wealth of disciplines represented on the voyage enabled them to work together to solve many pieces of the puzzle. They also discussed the potential loss of the wilderness and the indigenous peoples. They saw the remnants of the Yukon gold rush, and how self-serving treasure hunters were plundering the countryside and the dignity and viability of the indigenous cultures. But in many ways, they were still firmly rooted in 19th-century science. In the 19th century, the common way to write scientific articles was to create endlessly long descriptions of the physical characteristics of plants or animals. Most of the publications from the expedition followed this protocol. This approach to biology withered away in the early 20th century. Another example of 19th-century thinking was their perspective on indigenous cultures. Their ethnocentric view regarded the indigenous people as savages. While the scientists remarked in horror that the indigenous cultures were disappearing, they simultaneously felt that adopting modern European-style technology, dress, and customs would somehow be a helpful step for them. The intersection of 19th- and 20th-century science was even evident among different opinions of those on the expedition. Upon seeing the indigenous peoples involved in salmon fishing operations and canning factories, those on the Elder felt different things. Some saw the cannery operations as forced labor, akin to slavery. Other expedition members saw the cannery operations as efficient and effective. ===Cape Fox Artifacts=== On July 26, 1899, the expedition landed in Cape Fox, at an abandoned Tlingit village. The village had been deserted for about five years, but many pieces of Tlingit artwork and totem poles were still there. Some members of the expedition (in protest of other members) removed some of the artifacts from the village. While this has been described by some as \\"looting,\\" it must be considered in the context of the times. Members of the expedition believed that the indigenous cultures of Alaska would soon be extinguished by the encroaching of modern civilization. Their desire was to save to museums what they believed would be the last remnants of the Tlingit artwork and culture. The expedition saw the artifacts as inanimate objects from a deserted village. To the Tlingit living nearby, the artifacts were a sacred part of their identity. The Cape Fox artifacts were indeed preserved in museums. In 2001, a group of scientists retraced the steps of the 1899 Harriman Expedition. The 2001 scientists and crew, including the great-great-granddaughter of Edward Harriman, returned a number of artifacts to the descendants of the original Cape Fox Tlingit residents.Litwin, T. (Ed.) (2005). The Harriman Alaska expedition retraced: A century of change, 1899‚Äì2001.

In Austria Heavy Petting Zoo peaked at No. 20, while the album achieved the No. 13 position in both Sweden and Finland. ==Music== NOFX recorded the album in October 1995 with Ryan Greene at the Razor's Edge studio, San Francisco, a garage described by the band as \\"a total dive\\".

It is a compatible successor of AmiFileSafe (AFS), with an emphasis on added reliability and speed compared to standard Amiga filesystems. It also features multi-user abilities like the older MuFS. The device is split into two main areas. At the beginning of the device is the metadata section, which consists of a root block, and a generic array of blocks that can be allocated to store metadata. The rest of the device is another contiguous generic array of blocks that can be allocated to store data. The metadata section usually uses a few percent of the device, depending on the size of the device. The metadata is stored as a tree of single blocks in the metadata section. The entire directory structure is recorded in the metadata, so the data section purely contains data from files. The metadata describes the location of data in files with extents of blocks, which makes the metadata quite compact. When a metadata update occurs, the system looks at the block containing the metadata to be changed, and copies it to a newly allocated block from the metadata section, with the change made, then it recursively changes the metadata in the block that points to that block in the same way. This way, eventually the root block needs to be changed, which causes the atomic metadata update. The filesystem is reasonably good at keeping files unfragmented, although there is a defragmentation tool available which will work on an online filesystem. It was the first filesystem to introduce the concept of the Recycle Bin natively at filesystem-level to the Amiga, holding the last few deleted files in a hidden directory on the disk root.

Hobbiss & William Bloye The Antelope, a former public house, Holland W. Hobbiss & William Bloye The Mermaid public house, damaged by fire Sparkhill is an inner-city area of Birmingham, England, situated between Springfield, Hall Green and Sparkbrook. ==Etymology== Sparkhill takes its name from Spark Brook, a small stream that flows from Moseley to the River Cole in Small Heath. It was, as the name suggests, a hill that was situated alongside the stream. The watercourse can be traced almost entirely along its length from source to where it joins the River Tame, although most of its tributaries are now culverted, and is a popular route for leisure walkers and cyclists. The only part where it cannot easily be followed is a short tunnel where it passes under the Grand Union Canal, very close to the old BSA motorcycle factory near Golden Hillock Road. Most of the route is accessible through Ackers Trust artificial ski slope and sports centre, which was built on BSA's old test track. This part of the route is still used for off-road cycling and similar pursuits. ==History== Historically part of Worcestershire, Sparkhill once existed as a rural area with its main industry being agriculture until the 1880s. In the Middle Ages, the Sparke family farmed in the area. Development of the area began in the 1890s as a result of the Industrial Revolution which was causing Birmingham to expand. In the 1850s, a small area of land was bought by a building society and sold to separate developers who built houses for the working class. People who owned a property were entitled to vote and a campaigner for the working class vote was Joseph Sturge, a Birmingham manufacturer. As a result of his campaigning, a newly created street in the area was named after him. The architecture of the houses was varied due to the different developers. A centre began to develop for the area with its own pub, The Cherry Arbour. In the late 1860s, developments appeared all over Sparkhill with the creation of long, straight streets forming a uniform pattern. The new houses were terraced with their own back garden, coal shed and lavatory. For the wealthy middle class, larger houses were built in a plot bounded by Stoney Lane, Alfred Road and Durham Road. St John's Church A sculpture at Sparkhill Methodist Church Sparkhill was removed from the possession of Yardley and became an area of Birmingham in 1911 as part of the Greater Birmingham Act. Yardley also became a suburb of Birmingham in the same year. The former council house for Yardley District Council (built 1898‚Äì1902, architect Arthur Harrison) was converted into Sparkhill Library () and opened on 19 January 1923. It is one of the earliest examples of double-glazed windows in a public building. Other buildings built for the district were a police station, magistrate's court and a fire station, which were all located next to the council house. St John's Church is the local Anglican Parish Church and the home of the charity Narthex Sparkhill. Designed by the famous Birmingham Architects Martin and Chamberlain, the church was built in 1888. A reredos in memory of Louisa Ryland was erected in the church after her death. As a result of the nearby BSA factory being targeted, the area suffered from bombing in World War II, resulting in the loss of some houses, and their 1940s replacement (e.g. the houses at 180‚Äì190 Osborne Road). A memorial to those from the BSA works who died during the Second World War can be found in St John's Church. Another old landmark in Sparkhill is the Mermaid Inn, which has been the site of a pub since the 17th century. The building was converted into a Balti restaurant in the late 20th century; however, it was severely damaged by numerous fires in the 2000s decade. The building's art deco exterior decoration is by local sculptor William Bloye. Other pubs, the Bear and The Antelope, both designed by Holland W. Hobbiss, have sculpted pub signs by William Bloye. The Antelope was, in 2010, converted into a Pakistani restaurant known as \\"Hajees Spice\\". ==Immigration== In the 20th century, the area became heavily influenced by migrants who settled in the area. The first wave of immigrants were of Irish descent. This has progressed to include Afro- Caribbeans, South Asians, and more recently Somalis. Moreover in the last decade, migrants of Romanian descent have begun to settle in the area, mostly inhabiting terraced houses. It has a large population of ethnic minorities, mainly of South Asian origin, which is reflected by the number of Asian eateries in the area. As a result, Sparkhill has become a main centre in the \\"Balti Triangle\\" of Birmingham. ==Notable residents of Sparkhill== *Bev Bevan, drummer with the Move and the Electric Light Orchestra. *Charlie Timmins, Coventry City captain. *Gil Merrick, Birmingham City goalkeeper. *John Bentley, actor born in Sparkhill (1916) *Kevin McDonald, archbishop. *Lock Up, band *Moazzam Begg, Guantanamo Bay detainee. *Paul Bliss, keyboard player with the Moody Blues, the Hollies and the Bliss Band *Moeen Munir Ali, England International Cricketer. *Robert Melville, art critic. *Sid Field, comedian. *Roland Gift, actor and lead singer of Fine Young Cannibals *Simon Inglis, Architectural historian, writer and broadcaster. ==Popular culture== The BBC sitcom Citizen Khan focuses on the life of Mr Khan and his family, Pakistani immigrants in the Sparkhill area, which it dubbed \\"The capital of British Pakistan\\" in the credits.

Since the advent of the Internet, it is now relatively easy to discover the real name of a wrestler, but it was far more difficult in the past. Some examples of ring names are Michael Shawn Hickenbottom becoming Shawn Michaels, Roderick George Toombs becoming \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper, Michael Sean Coulthard becoming Michael Cole, Dwayne Johnson becoming The Rock, and Chris Irvine becoming Chris Jericho. A number of wrestlers have adopted their real name or a variation thereof for their in-ring persona, sometimes modifying the spelling of their real name to better fit their gimmick, such as Dave Bautista becoming Batista (now credited as Dave Bautista in his current acting career), Patricia Stratigeas becoming Trish Stratus, Richard Fliehr becoming Ric Flair, and Kristen Stadtlander becoming Kris Statlander. Others simply use part of their name, such as Bill Goldberg using Goldberg, Kenny Dykstra using Kenny, Nicole Garcia-Colace using Nikki Bella, Mike Mizanin using The Miz (an abbreviation of his surname), Cody Runnels using Cody (with Cody Rhodes being his full ring name), Michael Wardlow using Wardlow, and Brandi Runnels being referred to as Brandi Rhodes. Many female wrestlers go solely by their first name as well. Many also use a nickname in addition to their real name for marketability and other reasons. Some (mostly independent) wrestlers, still go to great lengths to ensure that their real names are not publicly known. Professional wrestlers are often referred to by their contemporaries by their ring name. In interviews, Bret Hart has regularly referred to Mark Calaway, Curt Hennig and Kevin Nash by their ring names (The Undertaker, Mr. Perfect, and Diesel). Ring names are often trademarked by the promotion that creates a character or gimmick for a performer. It is common to see one performer use a variety of ring names throughout his career, even if his overall persona or gimmick remains similar. That is especially true in WWE, which has largely forced most wrestlers that have debuted since 2006 to use a WWE-owned ring name instead of a ring name that they used on the independent circuit or, such as with Daniel Bryan and a few others, their real name. One notable recent exception was made for David Otunga because of his then-current real-life relationship with singer Jennifer Hudson, which gave WWE some mainstream exposure. For example, Low Ki used a ring name specifically for his second TNA stint so that he would continue to hold on to his original ring name, Low Ki, used elsewhere. Another example is the team known as The Dudley Boyz in ECW and WWE, and Team 3D elsewhere. WWE trademarked the \\"Dudley Boyz\\" name, leading them to have to change their name when they went to TNA. The members' names Bubba Ray Dudley, D-Von Dudley, and Spike Dudley were also trademarked by WWE, forcing them to have to change their names to Brother Ray, Brother Devon, and Brother Runt. (Bubba Ray and D-Von later returned to WWE and reassumed the \\"Dudley Boyz\\" name; D-Von has since retired, now working as a WWE producer, while Bubba Ray works for Ring of Honor, under the ring name Bully Ray). WWE partially repealed the policy in 2015, allowing wrestlers who were well-known in other promotions such as Samoa Joe, A.J. Styles, Ethan Carter III (shortened to EC3), Shinsuke Nakamura, Austin Aries, Karl Anderson, Bobby Roode and Eric Young to use their long-standing ring names (or in Nakamura and Roode's case, their real name) as well as wrestlers who sign \\"Tier 2\\" NXT brand contracts such as Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa who wrestle both on NXT and the independent circuit to keep their ring names or in Gargano's case, their real name. Gargano and Ciampa have since signed exclusive WWE contracts. \\"In-house\\" WWE wrestlers still use WWE-owned ring names. In rare cases, the rights to a wrestler's ring name may be owned by a company with little or no connection to professional wrestling, such as Marvel Comics' ownership of the name Hulk Hogan until early 2003, which was due to Hogan being advertised as The Incredible Hulk Hogan early in his career, while Marvel owned the trademark for their comic book character The Incredible Hulk. Sometimes a wrestler will buy the rights to their own ring name; for example, Steve Borden owns the rights to the name \\"Sting\\". The man formerly known as Test took this one step further and legally changed his name to Andrew Test Martin. Jim Hellwig, known as The Ultimate Warrior, had his name legally changed to simply \\"Warrior\\". In many cases, ring names evolve over time as the wrestler's gimmick changes, either subtly or dramatically. After debuting in WWE as the \\"Connecticut Blueblood\\", Hunter Hearst Helmsley, Paul Levesque's character morphed into Triple H upon forming D-Generation X. A more drastic change sometimes occurs when a wrestler turns babyface or heel, such as when WCW face Hulk Hogan joined the nWo as Hollywood Hogan. Hogan's villainous new attitude was enhanced by changing his costume color scheme from Hulkamania's red and yellow to nWo's black and white. Brother Ray adopted the name Bully Ray when he turned heel. When Steve Williams joined the wrestling world in the late 1980s, there was already \\"Dr. Death\\" Steve Williams. He therefore adopted the name by which he would eventually become famous, Stone Cold Steve Austin or Stunning Steve Austin, which later became his legal name (as Steve Austin, without the \\"Stone Cold\\" portion). ==Boxing== Many boxers have used ring names as their mode of identification during their professional boxing careers, particularly more so during the late 19th century and the early 20th century. Some began with the prefix \\"Kid\\". Famous examples include: *Kid Azteca *Kid Chocolate *Kid Diamond *Kid Gavilan *Kid Meza *Jack Kid Berg *Jersey Joe Walcott *Joey Giardello *Rocky Marciano *Takaloo *Tony DeMarco ==Global use== * In Japan, sumo wrestlers use a ring name called shikona (). Other martial artists use 'martial names' or 'warrior names' called Bug≈ç. * In Mexico and Puerto Rico, lucha libre wrestlers use ring names and conceal their identities with masks. * In Latin America, boxers often use nicknames alongside their real names, and both may be used each time they are introduced. Examples include Wilfred \\"El Radar\\" Benitez, Wilfredo \\"Bazooka\\" Gomez, and Alexis \\"El Flaco Explosivo\\" Arg√ºello. * In Thailand, both professional boxers and Muay Thai kickboxers tend to use the last name as their stable or gym, for example Khaosai Galaxy, Khaokor Galaxy, Sot Chitalada, Samart Payakaroon, Kongtoranee Payakaroon, Namphon Nongkee Pahuyuth, Namkabuan Nongkee Pahuyuth, Ratanapol Sor Vorapin, Ratanachai Sor Vorapin, Saen Sor Ploenchit, Chatchai Singwangcha, Saman Sorjaturong, Veeraphol Nakornlouang Promotion, Nawaphon Nakornloung Promotion. Also, in the latter, the names of supporters have been introduced (mostly brands of various products, and these names can change depending on the brand of the product they sponsor) to be used as last names as well, for example Samson Dutch Boy Gym, Yodsanan 3-K Battery, Poonsawat Kratingdaenggym, Teerachai Kratingdaenggym, Knockout CP Freshmart etc. ==In fiction== Lisbeth Salander's kickboxing ringname and hacker handle is Wasp, and she has a wasp tattoo on her neck. ==References== ==External links== * Wrestlers Real Names List == See also == * Stage name *Code name * Aviator call sign * Nickname * Pseudonym * Shikona Category:Professional wrestling slang Category:Pseudonyms Category:Boxing culture Category:Martial arts culture ","title":"Ring name"},{"id":"844985","text":"Stechford is an area of East Birmingham, England, situated about five miles east of the city centre, bordering Ward End, Yardley, Hodge Hill and Kitts Green. Historically it lay within Worcestershire.https://wikishire.co.uk/map/#Stechford@52.485,-1.817/centre=52.485,-1.817/zoom=14 ==History== Stechford's history is unclear. Its oldest components are Station Road (known as Stoney Lane since Norman times) and Flaxleye Farm, first referenced in 1218. The farm itself no longer remains, however there is a farmhouse at 143 Flaxley Road, although the oldest parts of the current building cannot be older than the 17th century. The closest buildings of historical importance are St Edburgh's church and Blakesley Hall, both a stone's throw outside Stechford in Yardley. The name Stechford is apparently a reference to the Stich or Stitch, a local tributary of the River Cole, although the Stitch is now entirely under culverts. A ford over the Cole is first referenced in 1249. The name Stechford was unknown until the construction of Stechford Station in 1844, and it has been conjectured that it was simply a railway misspelling. The name Stycheforde is attested since 1400. The common misspelling Stetchford is not an acceptable variant. Old Stechford appears to have been mainly a cluster of buildings around the railway station. Until 1900, most of the area was still farmland. Some station houses are still present and remain along the main road. However, development on this area was considered difficult due to the steep gradient of the land nearby which can clearly be seen. This resulted in buildings built on the slope having to have stilts located underneath the ground floor. In some buildings, these are clearly visible. For most of the 20th century Stechford was its own parliamentary constituency, represented by Roy Jenkins, Labour for 27 years from 1950, although it has been alleged in parliament that he never lived there.5 Nov 1998 debate on Roy Jenkins When Jenkins stepped down to become a European Commissioner in 1977, the seat was won by Conservative Andrew MacKay, and Jenkins's future partners, the Liberal Party were leapfrogged by the British National Front, whose candidate Andrew Brons obtained third place. The National Front and its successor British National Party have continued to target the area. In 1983, the Stechford constituency was broken up into Birmingham Hodge Hill and Birmingham Yardley. The first UK branch of German discount supermarket Aldi opened in 1990. ==Politics== Stechford is part of the Stechford and Yardley North Ward of the Yardley Constituency. As of 2005, the councillors are Neil Eustace, Carol Jones and Barbara Jackson, and the MP is Labour MP Jess Phillips . Until 2005, the constituency was held by Estelle Morris (Labour), who was Secretary of State for Education in Tony Blair's Labour administration. From 1950 to 1977, the area was represented in the Stechford constituency by Roy Jenkins, (as a Labour MP), who was one of the biggest figures in British politics between the 1960s and 1980s. The ward councillors work closely with an advisory board of local people, which has led to the creation of a playground area next to the Cascades, the provision of security gates on many access alleys, and improvements to street lighting. Politician Enoch Powell was born at Flaxley Lane, Stechford, in 1912. He moved to Kings Norton in 1918 and would later go on to be a classical scholar, poet, youngest Brigadier in the British Army when he fought in the Second World War, and politician. He is best known for his Rivers of Blood speech in 1968. ==Attractions== Stechford has a long-standing row of shops along Station Road, with a lesser group of shops on Albert Road. Main shopping centres are connected by the Outer Ring Road (A4040) and Outer Circle bus. Nearby shopping areas are the Fox & Goose in Ward End and The Yew Tree in Yardley. Links to Birmingham are provided by bus services 14 (Audley Road) and 97 (Bordesley Green East). The local railway station is Stechford railway station. On 28 February 1967, Stechford station was the scene of a train collision which killed nine people and injured 16. Opposite the station is The Stechford Club which was founded in 1907. Houses in the area are mainly council houses or old Victorian houses built around the station. ==Churches== Stechford has three churches. Stechford Baptist,Stechford Baptist website on Victoria Road, All Saints (Anglican) on Albert Road, and Corpus Christi (Catholic) on Albert Road. The churches hold an annual Remembrance Day service at the Five Ways War Memorial on Remembrance Sunday, early November, which is attended by about 200 people. ==Geography== The district is cut across by the River Cole, the Birmingham to London railway, and the Birmingham Outer Circle (A4040). All of the land around the Cole is flood plain, which means that Stechford has a wide swathe of green, semi-wild vegetation. It is still possible to canoe from Stechford to Water Orton. The Cole and the green area around it, are being restored through the Kingfisher Project.Project Kingfisher website The project also takes in Stechford Fairground, which is home to two funfairs each year. The area around the River Cole is now green belt land which prevents developers from constructing on the site. ==Healthcare== *National Health Service care is provided by Birmingham East and North Primary Care TrustBirmingham East and North Primary Care Trust *Heartlands Hospital is a major local employerHeart of England foundation trust ==References== ==External links== * Maps & Links related to Stechford * Reference to River Cole * Virtual Brum * 1888 Ordnance Survey map of Stechford Category:Areas of Birmingham, West Midlands ","title":"Stechford"},{"id":"844989","text":"See also: 2001 Canadian incumbents, 2003 Canadian incumbents ==Crown== *Head of State - Queen Elizabeth II ==Federal government== *Governor General - Adrienne Clarkson ===Cabinet=== *Prime Minister - Jean Chr√©tien *Deputy Prime Minister - Herb Gray then John Manley *Minister of Finance - Paul Martin then John Manley *Minister of Foreign Affairs - John Manley then Bill Graham *Minister of National Defence - Art Eggleton then John McCallum *Minister of Health - Allan Rock then Anne McLellan *Minister of Industry - Brian Tobin then Allan Rock *Minister of Heritage - Sheila Copps *Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs - St√©phane Dion *Minister of the Environment - David Anderson *Minister of Justice - Anne McLellan then Martin Cauchon *Minister of Transport - David Collenette *Minister of Citizenship and Immigration - Elinor Caplan then Denis Coderre *Minister of Fisheries and Oceans - Herb Dhaliwal then Robert Thibault *Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food - Lyle Vanclief *Minister of Public Works and Government Services - Alfonso Gagliano then Don Boudria then Ralph Goodale *Minister of Human Resources Development - Jane Stewart *Minister of Natural Resources - Ralph Goodale then Herb Dhaliwal ==Members of Parliament== See: 37th Canadian parliament ===Party leaders=== *Liberal Party of Canada - Jean Chr√©tien *Canadian Alliance - Stockwell Day then Stephen Harper *Bloc Qu√©b√©cois - Gilles Duceppe *New Democratic Party- Alexa McDonough *Progressive Conservative Party of Canada - Joe Clark ===Supreme Court justices=== *Chief Justice: Beverley McLachlin *Frank Iacobucci *John C.

The significant landmarks in the area include Jaguar Cars' Castle Bromwich Assembly factory, Fort Dunlop and Pype Hayes Park. The Castle Vale Library, built in 2006, serves the area. The library was designed by Birmingham-based Associated Architects and built by the Castle Vale Housing Action Trust. ==Geography of the area== Tyburn covers the municipal housing estates of Birches Green, Pype Hayes and Castle Vale as well as Erdington Hall, a residential area. The housing estates of Pype Hayes and Castle Vale have witnessed significant regeneration in recent times. Entire estates in Pype Hayes were cleared and replaced with modern housing by Birmingham City Council. Castle Vale was home to one of Europe's largest urban regeneration projects which resulted in the demolition of many tower blocks and low rise flats and the construction of a retail park and semi-detached modern housing. This was done by the Housing Action Trust, established in 1993. The industrial area of Bromford was formerly part of the old Kingsbury Ward most of which was incorporated into the new Tyburn Ward. It has witnessed redevelopment in the form of the construction of the Fort Shopping Centre and the Heartlands Spine Road which connects the A47 Nechells to the A47 Chester Road. ==Population== The 2001 Population Census recorded that there were 16,480 people living in Tyburn with a population density of 2,816 people per km¬≤ compared with 3,649 people per km¬≤ for Birmingham. This ward has the smallest population of all Birmingham City wards. 8.9% (1,465) of the ward's population consists of ethnic minorities compared with 29.6% for Birmingham in general. At the time of the 2011 Census the population had increased to 25,927. ==Politics== Tyburn is represented by three Labour councillors on Birmingham City Council. The ward has adopted a Ward Support Officer.

He was also the grandson of Boris Petrovich Sheremetev. His father P. B. Sheremetev was passionate about the theatre and transferred this passion to his son. N. P. Sheremetev spent his early youth at court. From the age of 13 to 14 he started to act in private theatricals of his father, and then \\"on the big court theatre\\". In 1765 he played the role of the god Hymen in the mythological ballet Acis and Galathea, in which his childhood comrade, the future Paul I, had distinguished himself. Having a special passion for music, Nikolai Petrovich masterfully played the cello. From 1769 to 1773 he traveled abroad: he attended lectures in Leiden University in the Netherlands, traveled across England, Germany, and Switzerland, took music lessons, and got acquainted with theatre life. In France he took a great interest in op√©ra comique. Returning to Moscow and receiving the post of director of the Moscow bank for noblemen, Sheremetev started to reconstruct his father's theatre: he engaged in special education of serf children, \\"certain to theatre\\" (Russian letters, foreign languages, music, singing, dance, diction, refined manners). Feeling extraordinary talent in one of his students, Parasha Kovaleva (Praskovya Ivanovna Kovaleva), he gave her more and more attention, preparing for her star career as the future \\"Praskovya Zhemchugova\\", whom he married in 1801. Sheremetev's performances involved Moscow gentlefolk. From a small private theatre of the count P. B. Sheremetev, it grew into a troupe capable of giving \\"an opera and allegorical ballets\\". From the moment of his return from abroad Sheremetev not only watched closely all events of the Moscow theatre life, but on a regular basis he took out the troupe to performances of theatre Medox, and he invited lead actors of Peter theatre (theatre Medox) to teach serf actors. In the beginning of 1790 Sheremetev decided to transfer the serf theatre from Kuskovo to Ostankino. On July 22, 1795 the theatre was opened with the premiere of the heroic opera The Capture of Izmail (P. Potemkin's libretto, I. Kozlovski's music). Sheremetev's theatre left far behind numerous other serf troupes (the only exception was the theatre of the Count A. R. Vorontsov). In 1796 Sheremetev was made a senator, and in March he moved to St. Petersburg to Catherine II's court. On November 6, 1796 Catherine died and the throne was inherited by Paul I who gave Sheremetev the title of marshal. Sheremetev's life proceeded in St.Petersburg, Pavlovsk, Gatchina; he was engaged in theatre much less. Because of the incurable illness of Zhemchugova, who was now his wife, the Count closed the theatre in Ostankino, and on November 6, 1801 he secretly married her, having first found in an archive the facts testifying to her \\"origin\\" from the Polish noble clan of Kovalev. The marriage was made public only after Zhemchugova's death (on February 23, 1803). Sheremetev sent a letter to the tsar, informing him about his marriage with a woman \\"whose origin incontestably had a noble beginning\\" and about the birth of his son and heir. Sheremetev died six years later, in 1809. In his will he gave instructions for a very simple funeral, in a simple board coffin, with the money intended for a funeral distributed instead to the poor and monasteries. ==Ancestry== ==External links== *Douglas Smith, The Pearl: A True Tale of Forbidden Love in Catherine the Great's Russia Category:1751 births Category:1809 deaths Category:Russian nobility Nikolai Category:Recipients of the Order of Saint Stanislaus Category:Burials at Lazarevskoe Cemetery (Saint Petersburg) ","title":"Nikolai Sheremetev"},{"id":"845004","text":"==Winners== ===Book of the Year=== :Richard Holmes, Coleridge: Early Visions ===Children's Book=== *Hugh Scott, Why Weeps the Brogan? ===First Novel=== *James Hamilton-Paterson, Gerontius ===Novel=== *Lindsay Clarke, The Chymical Wedding ===Biography=== *Richard Holmes, Coleridge: Early Visions ===Poetry=== *Michael Donaghy, Shibboleth ==References== *Previous winners Category:Costa Book Awards Whitbread Whitbread Awards ","title":"1989 Whitbread Awards"},{"id":"845005","text":"==Book of the Year== :Paul Sayer, The Comforts of Madness ==Children's Book== Winner: *Judy Allen, Awaiting Developments ==First Novel== Winner: *Paul Sayer, The Comforts of Madness ==Novel== Winner: *Salman Rushdie, The Satanic Verses ==Biography== Winners: *A.

The F/A-18E single-seat and F/A-18F tandem-seat variants are larger and more advanced derivatives of the F/A-18C and D Hornet. The Super Hornet has an internal 20 mm M61 rotary cannon and can carry air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface weapons. Additional fuel can be carried in up to five external fuel tanks and the aircraft can be configured as an airborne tanker by adding an external air refueling system. Designed and initially produced by McDonnell Douglas, the Super Hornet first flew in 1995. Low-rate production began in early 1997 with full-rate production starting in September 1997, after the merger of McDonnell Douglas and Boeing the previous month. The Super Hornet entered fleet service with the United States Navy in 1999, replacing the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, which was retired in 2006; the Super Hornet serves alongside the original Hornet. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), which has operated the F/A-18A as its main fighter since 1984, ordered the F/A-18F in 2007 to replace its aging General Dynamics F-111C fleet. RAAF Super Hornets entered service in December 2010. ==Development== ===Origins=== The Super Hornet is an evolutionary redesign of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. The Super Hornet's unique wing and tail configuration can be traced back to an internal Northrop project P-530, ; this had started as a substantial rework of the lightweight F-5E with a larger wing, twin tail fins and a distinctive leading edge root extension (LERX). Later flying as the Northrop YF-17 \\"Cobra\\", it competed in the United States Air Force's Lightweight Fighter (LWF) program to produce a smaller and simpler fighter to complement the larger McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle; the YF-17 lost the competition to the YF-16. The Navy directed that the YF-17 be redesigned into the larger F/A-18 Hornet to meet a requirement for a multi-role fighter to complement the larger and more expensive Grumman F-14 Tomcat serving in fleet defense interceptor and air superiority roles. The Hornet proved to be effective but limited in combat radius. The concept of an enlarged Hornet was first proposed in the 1980s, which was marketed by McDonnell Douglas as Hornet 2000. The Hornet 2000 concept was an advanced F/A-18 with a larger wing and a longer fuselage to carry more fuel and more powerful engines.Jenkins, Dennis R. F/A-18 Hornet: A Navy Success Story. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2000. .\\"F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.\\" Boeing. Retrieved: 25 July 2011. The end of the Cold War led to a period of military budget cuts and considerable restructuring. At the same time, U.S. Naval Aviation faced a number of problems. The McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II was canceled in 1991 after the program ran into serious problems; it was intended to replace the obsolete Grumman A-6 Intruder and LTV A-7 Corsair II.Donald 2004, p. 45. The Navy considered updating an existing design as a more attractive approach to a clean-sheet program. As an alternative to the A-12, McDonnell Douglas proposed the \\"Super Hornet\\" (initially \\"Hornet II\\" in the 1980s), an improvement of the successful previous F/A-18 models, which could serve as an alternate replacement for the A-6 Intruder. The next-generation Hornet design proved more attractive than Grumman's Quick Strike upgrade to the F-14 Tomcat, which was regarded as an insufficient technological leap over existing F-14s. VFA-143 \\"Pukin Dogs\\" F-14B and F/A-18E in 2005 At the time, the Grumman F-14 Tomcat was the Navy's primary air superiority fighter and fleet defense interceptor. Then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney described the F-14 as 1960s technology, and drastically cut back F-14D procurement in 1989 before cancelling production altogether in 1991, in favor of the updated F/A-18E/F.Donald, David. \\"Northrop Grumman F-14 Tomcat, U.S. Navy today\\". Warplanes of the Fleet. London: AIRtime Publishing Inc, 2004. . The decision to replace the Tomcat with an all-Hornet Carrier Air Wing was controversial; Vietnam War ace and Congressman Duke Cunningham criticized the Super Hornet as an unproven design that compromised air superiority. In 1992, the Navy canceled the Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), which would have been a navalized variant of the Air Force's Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. As a cheaper alternative to NATF, Grumman proposed substantial improvements to the F-14 beyond Quick Strike, but Congress rejected them as too costly and reaffirmed its commitment to the less expensive F/A-18E/F.Donald 2004, pp. 13, 15. ===Testing and production=== F/A-18F Super Hornet (left) and a F/A-18A Hornet (right) The Super Hornet was first ordered by the U.S. Navy in 1992.Young, J., R.

The Navy retained the F/A-18 designation to help sell the program to Congress as a low-risk \\"derivative\\", though the Super Hornet is largely a new aircraft. The Hornet and Super Hornet share many characteristics, including avionics, ejection seats, radar, armament, mission computer software, and maintenance/operating procedures. The initial F/A-18E/F retained most of the avionics systems from the F/A-18C/D's configuration at the time. The design would be expanded in the Super Hornet with an empty weight slightly greater than the F-15C. The Super Hornet first flew on 29 November 1995. Initial production on the F/A-18E/F began in 1995. Flight testing started in 1996 with the F/A-18E/F's first carrier landing in 1997. Low-rate production began in March 1997 with full production beginning in September 1997. Testing continued through 1999, finishing with sea trials and aerial refueling demonstrations. Testing involved 3,100 test flights covering 4,600 flight hours. The Super Hornet underwent U.S. Navy operational tests and evaluations in 1999, and was approved in February 2000.Nathman, John, Rear Admiral U.S. Navy. \\"DoD Special Briefing on \\"Super Hornet\\" Operation Evaluation Results.\\" Defenselink.mil, 15 September 2000.

The F/A-18E single-seat and F/A-18F two-seat aircraft took the place of the F-14 Tomcat, A-6 Intruder, Lockheed S-3 Viking, and KA-6D aircraft. An electronic warfare variant, the EA-18G Growler, replaces the EA-6B Prowler. The Navy calls this reduction in aircraft types a \\"neck-down\\". During the Vietnam War era, the Super Hornet's roles were performed by a combination of the A-1/A-4/A-7 (light attack), A-6 (medium attack), F-8/F-4 (fighter), RA-5C (recon), KA-3/KA-6 (tanker), and EA-6 (electronic warfare). It was anticipated that $1 billion in fleetwide annual savings would result from replacing other types with the Super Hornet.

The Navy plans to sign year to year contracts with Boeing to convert all of its Block II aircraft to Block III variants thru 2033. ==Design== ===Overview=== An F/A-18F refueling an F/A-18E over the alt=Two aircraft flying high above clouds, transferring fuel through a pipe to which the lower aircraft is connected. The Super Hornet is largely a new aircraft at about 20% larger, heavier empty weight, and heavier maximum weight than the original Hornet. The Super Hornet carries 33% more internal fuel, increasing mission range by 41% and endurance by 50% over the \\"Legacy\\" Hornet. The empty weight of the Super Hornet is about less than that of the F-14 Tomcat which it replaced, while approaching, but not matching, the F-14's payload and range. As the Super Hornet is significantly heavier than the legacy Hornet, the catapult and arresting systems must be set differently. To aid safe flight operations and prevent confusion in radio calls, the Super Hornet is informally referred to as the \\"Rhino\\" to distinguish it from earlier Hornets. (The \\"Rhino\\" nickname was previously applied to the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, which was retired from the fleet in 1987.) The Super Hornet, unlike the previous Hornet, is designed to be equipped with an aerial refueling system (ARS) or \\"buddy store\\" for the refueling of other aircraft, filling the tactical airborne tanker role the Navy had lost with the retirement of the KA-6D and Lockheed S-3B Viking tankers. The ARS includes an external tank with hose reel on the centerline, along with four external tanks and internal tanks, for a total of of fuel on the aircraft.Donald 2004, p. 76. On typical missions a fifth of the air wing is dedicated to the tanker role, which consumes aircraft fatigue life expectancy faster than other missions. ===Airframe changes=== Oval Hornet air intakes vs Rectangular Super Hornet alt=Comparisons between rectangular and oval jet engine intakes The forward fuselage is unchanged, but the remainder of the aircraft shares little with earlier F/A-18C/D models. The fuselage was stretched by to make room for fuel and future avionics upgrades and increased the wing area by 25%.Donald 2004, pp. 49‚Äì52. However, the Super Hornet has 42% fewer structural parts than the original Hornet design.\\"F/A-18E/F Super Hornet ‚Äì maritime strike attack aircraft.\\" naval-technology.com. Retrieved: 9 September 2011. The General Electric F414 engine, developed from the Hornet's F404, has 35% additional thrust over most of the aircraft's flight envelope.Elward 2001, p. 77. The Super Hornet can return to an aircraft carrier with a larger load of unspent fuel and munitions than the original Hornet; this ability is known as \\"bringback\\", which for the Super Hornet is in excess of . Other differences include intake ramps for the engines and two extra wing hard points for payload (for a total of 11), retaining previous hardpoints on the bottom centerline, wingtips, and two conformal fuselage positions.Elward 2001, pp. 74‚Äì75. Among the most significant aerodynamic changes are the enlarged leading edge extensions (LEX) which provide improved vortex lifting characteristics in high angle of attack maneuvers, and reduce the static stability margin to enhance pitching characteristics. This results in pitch rates in excess of 40 degrees per second, and high resistance to departure from controlled flight.\\"F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.\\" Boeing. Retrieved: 16 August 2010. ===Radar signature reduction measures=== The Super Hornet's S-duct-like air intake partially conceals engine blades from radar waves Survivability is an important feature of the Super Hornet design.

This means that it does not rely on very low-observable technology, i.e. stealth. Instead, its design incorporates a combination of signature reduction, advanced electronic-warfare capabilities, reduced ballistic vulnerability, use of standoff weapons, and innovative tactics that collectively enhance the safety of the fighter and crew in an affordable manner.\\"F/A-18-E/F Super Hornet...

The aircraft in the background is deploying alt=Two jet aircraft flying over clouds during dawn/dusk. The one in the foreground is perpendicular to the camera; the second further away is banking left while releasing orange flares. The F/A-18E/F's radar cross- section was reduced greatly from some aspects, mainly the front and rear. The design of the engine inlets reduces the aircraft's frontal radar cross- section. The alignment of the leading edges of the engine inlets is designed to scatter radiation to the sides. Fixed fanlike reflecting structures in the inlet tunnel divert radar energy away from the rotating fan blades.Donald 2004, pp. 50‚Äì51, 56. The Super Hornet also makes considerable use of panel joint serration and edge alignment. Considerable attention has been paid to the removal or filling of unnecessary surface join gaps and resonant cavities. Where the F/A-18A-D used grilles to cover various accessory exhaust and inlet ducts, the F/A-18E/F uses perforated panels that appear opaque to radar waves at the frequencies used. Careful attention has been paid to the alignment of many panel boundaries and edges, to direct reflected waves away from the aircraft in uniformly narrow angles. While the F/A-18E/F is not a stealth fighter like the F-22, it will have a frontal radar cross-section an order of magnitude smaller than prior generation fighters. Additional changes for reducing RCS can be installed on an as-needed basis. ===Avionics=== Initially, the Super Hornet's avionics and software had a 90% commonality with that of the F/A-18C/D fleet at the time. Differences include an up-front Touchscreen control display; a large multipurpose color liquid-crystal display; and a fuel display. The Super Hornet has a quadruplex digital fly-by-wire system,Winchester 2006, p. 166. as well as a digital flight-control system that detects and corrects for battle damage. Initial production models used the APG-73 radar, later replaced by the AN/APG-79 active electronically scanned array (AESA). The AN/ASQ-228 ATFLIR (Advanced Targeting Forward Looking InfraRed), is the main electro-optical sensor and laser designator pod for the Super Hornet. The communications equipment consist of an AN/ARC-210 VHF/UHF radio and a MIDS-JTRS low volume terminal for HAVE QUICK, SINCGARS and Link 16 connectivity. The defensive countermeasures of Block I aircraft includes the AN/ALR-67(V)3 radar warning receiver, the AN/ALE-47 countermeasures dispenser, the AN/ALE-50 towed decoy and the AN/ALQ-165 Airborne Self-Protect Jammer (ASPJ). Block II aircraft replace the ALQ-165 with the AN/ALQ-214 Integrated Defensive Countermeasures (IDECM) system, consisting of internally mounted threat receivers and optional self-protection jammers. Interior and exterior lighting on the Block II was changed to allow the use of night vision devices. The older ALE-50 decoys are being replaced by ALE-55 towed decoys, which can transmit jamming signals based on data received from the IDECM.Pike, John. \\"AN/ALE-55 Fiber Optic Towed Decoy.\\" Globalsecurity.org, 16 August 2010.

However, in June 2015 it was reported that Kuwait was considering a split purchase between the Eurofighter Typhoon and the F/A-18E/F.Kuwait, Italy Discuss Eurofighter Buy. Defense News, On 11 September 2015, Kuwait signed an agreement for 28 Eurofighter aircraft.

All of the aircraft are scheduled to be delivered by January 2021. ===Potential operators=== F/A-18F Super Hornet taxis to the runway for takeoff at Aero India 2011 ====Canada==== The Super Hornet has been a contender to replace the CF-18 Hornet, a version of the F/A-18A and B models, operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force. Like the older Hornet, the Super Hornet's design is well-suited to Northern Canada's rugged forward operational airfields, while its extended range removes its predecessor's main deficiency. Due to commonalities, training and integration would be straightforward in transitioning to the Super Hornet. In 2010, Canada decided on sole source selection of the F-35A. Boeing claimed that Canada had ignored the Super Hornet's radar cross-section characteristics during evaluation. By April 2012, Canada was reportedly reviewing its F-35 procurement.Campion- Smith, Bruce. \\"Ottawa to overhaul purchase of F-35 fighter jets in wake of Auditor General‚Äôs report\\". Toronto Star, 2 April 2012. In September 2013, Boeing provided Canada with data on its Advanced Super Hornet, suggesting that a fleet of 65 aircraft would cost $1.7 billion less than a fleet of F-35s. The US Navy buys Super Hornets for $52 million per aircraft, while the advanced model costs $6‚Äì$10 million more per aircraft, dependent on options selected.\\"Competition heats up as Ottawa reviews options to procure costly F-35 fighter jets\\" . Hilltimes.com, 5 September 2013 As a result of the 2015 Canadian federal election, the new Liberal government indicated that it would launch a competition to replace the CF-18 fleet. During the election, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau stated that his government would not buy the F-35.Berthiaume, Lee; Ivison, John. \\"Liberals planning to buy Super Hornet fighter jets before making final decision on F-35s, sources say\\" . National Post, 5 June 2016. On 22 November 2016, the Liberal government announced its intention to acquire 18 Super Hornets on an interim basis. A letter of request by the Canadian government was issued 14 March 2017 for 18 Super Hornets. In September 2017, the U.S State Department granted Canada permission to buy 10 F/A-18Es and 8 F/A-18Fs (or EA-18Gs) along with supporting equipment, spares, and armaments. The agreed cost for the 18 jets totaled CA$1.5 billion, or about CA$83.3 million per aircraft, adding the supporting equipment, training, spares, and weapons increased the acquisition cost to CA$6.3 billion. However, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned that pending Super Hornet sale to Canada along with a possible sale of another 70 was adversely affected by Boeing's actions against Bombardier Aerospace of Montreal. These included a complaint to the US government about Bombardier selling CSeries airliners to Delta Air Lines at unduly low prices; in September 2017, the U.S. Department of Commerce proposed a 219% tariff on CSeries imported into the US. In late 2017, the Canadian Government agreed with Australia to purchase 18 used F/A-18 Hornets as an interim measure to ensure fleet readiness. Boeing has confirmed its bid for the Advanced Fighter Program, likely offering a mix of 88 F/A-18E/F Advanced Super Hornets (Block III) and Boeing EA-18G Growler. ====Finland==== In June 2015, a working group set up by the Finnish MoD proposed starting the so-called HX Fighter Program to replace the Finnish Air Force's current fleet of F/A-18C/D Hornets, which will reach the end of their service life by the end of the 2020s. The group recognises five potential types: Boeing F/A-18E/F Advanced Super Hornet, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II and Saab JAS 39 Gripen. In May 2016, the Pentagon announced that two US manufacturers will respond to the information request regarding the fighter acquisition: Boeing with the Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin with the F-35. The request for information concerning the program was sent in early 2016 with five responses received in November 2016. A call for tender will be sent in spring 2018 and the buying decision is scheduled to take place in 2021. In February 2020, three Super Hornet aircraft arrived at the Tampere-Pirkkala Airbase in Finland for final flight evaluations in the HX Fighter Program, a single-seat F/A-18E, a twin- seat F/A-18F and an EA-18G. The evaluations concluded on 28 February 2020. ====Germany==== Germany requires a replacement for its aging Panavia Tornado fleet which includes both Tornado IDS (interdictor/strike) and ECR (Electronic Combat/Reconnaissance) variants. Germany considered ordering the F-35, Eurofighter Typhoon, the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the EA-18G Growler. In April 2020, Germany announced its replacement for its Panavia Tornado aircraft will be a split purchase of 30 Super Hornets, 15 EA-18G Growlers and 55 Eurofighter Typhoons.Germany picks Super Hornet and more Eurofighters for Tornado replacement Germany may purchase an additional 38 Typhoons to replace its oldest Typhoon model for a total purchase of 93. The Super Hornet was selected due to its compatibility with nuclear weapons and availability of an electronic attack version. As of March 2020, the Super Hornet is not certified for the B61 nuclear bombs, but Dan Gillian, head of Boeing's Super Hornet program, previously stated that \\"We certainly think that we, working with the U.S. government, can meet the German requirements there on the [German's] timeline.\\" ====Malaysia==== Boeing offered Malaysia Super Hornets as part of a buy-back package for its existing Hornets in 2002. However, the Super Hornet procurement was halted in 2007 after the government decided to purchase the Sukhoi Su-30MKM instead. But Chief Gen. Datuk Nik Ismail Nik Mohamaed of the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) indicated that the air force had not planned to end the Super Hornet procurement, stating that it needed such fighters.\\"Super Hornets, Awacs may feature in RMAF modernisation plans\\" . Utusan Malaysia, 16 April 2007. Retrieved: 5 September 2008. Separately, the F/A-18F Super Hornet is a contender for the MRCA program, under which the RMAF is looking to equip three squadrons with 36 to 40 new fighters with an estimated budget of RM6 billion to RM8 billion (US$1.84 billion to US$2.46 billion). Other competitors are the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale and Saab JAS 39 Gripen. ====Spain==== Spain is looking for 68-72 fighters to replace F/A-18A/B Hornet.

Flightglobal.com, 30 April 2008. Retrieved: 16 August 2013. The Swiss Air Force was at one point intending to buy the rival Saab Gripen, but this was blocked by Swiss voters in 2014. In March 2018, Swiss officials named contenders in its Air 2030 program: The Saab Gripen, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin F-35. The program has a budget of but includes not only combat aircraft but also ground-based air defense systems. In October 2018, it was reported by Jane's that the Swiss Air Force may be limited to purchasing a single-engine fighter due to cost. However, a bidder for the programme stated that Swiss Air Force pilots are \\"so enamoured of their Hornets that they will be inclined to select another two-seat fighter\\". The F/A-18E/F performed demonstrations for Swiss personnel at Payerne Air Base in April 2019, which was contrasted to flights performed by other bidders. ====Others==== The United Arab Emirates was reported to have asked for information on the Super Hornet in 2010.Tran, Philip. \\"UAE May Ditch Rafale: Hornet a Surprise Competitor for $10B Deal\\". defensenews.com, 13 September 2010.

In December 2018, the Bulgarian Ministry of Defence selected the offer for 8 F-16V from the United States for an estimated 1.8 billion lev ($1.05 billion) as the preferred option, and recommended the government to start talks with the US. In 2014, Boeing is working with Korean Airlines to offer the Advanced Super Hornet to the Republic of Korea Air Force as an alternative to their KF-X fighter program. Although a fighter based on the Super Hornet would save money, downgrading the program would not give South Korean industry as much knowledge as it would from developing a new fighter.Boeing Still Interested In South Korea‚Äôs KF-X - Aviationweek.com, 11 December 2014 ===Failed bids=== ====Belgium==== On 12 March 2014, Belgian newspaper De Morgen reported that Boeing is in talks with the Belgian Ministry of Defence about the Super Hornet as a candidate to replace Belgium's aging F-16 fleet.\\"Wordt dit de vervanger van de Belgische F-16's?\\" De Morgen, 12 March 2014.

However, whether it was due to lack of demand for places or just financial problems, the former Ward End Hall School was closed down and demolished in the mid-1990s. A housing estate now stands on the site of the former school. Park View School was renamed Rockwood Academy in 2015. In addition to Rockwood Academy, there is a secondary education establishment quite locally at Washwood Heath (Washwood Heath Academy) and two more in Hodge Hill (Hodge Hill College; and Hodge Hill Girls' School, a former grammar school). ==Places of worship== There are a number of places of worship in Ward End, including St Margarets Church, Christ Church, Ward End and Ward End Gospel church centre along with Emmanuel Christian Fellowship, led by the Rev. Steve Byrne and there are a large number of mosques, located on Ward End, Washwood Heath, Hodge Hill and Alum Rock Road or nearby. ==Unusual events== Several unusual events have occurred in Ward End over the years. In late-1981 and into 1982, the residents of five houses on Thornton Road informed the police that stones had been thrown against their windows at night. The stones had no fingerprints, so a night-time surveillance using infra-red cameras and image-intensifiers was set up. The stone-throwing continued even though no human activity was seen. Eventually the Birmingham CID gave up and left the case open. In late-2004 and early 2005, there were rumours that a man had bitten several people on Glen Park Road; described as being black and in his mid-20s he was dubbed the \\"Birmingham Vampire\\". However the police had received no reports of any attack, and the hospitals had received no bite victims. The local press was inundated with calls from worried residents in Ward End and the surrounding area. The case has been dismissed as an urban legend.https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/17/samjones In 2006, Tarmac (a heavy building materials company) drew up a list of Britain's \\"spookiest roads\\", with Drews Lane in Ward End coming tenth.

It was founded in 1118 by king Tadhg Mac C√°rthaigh, when the Treaty of Glanmire formally divided the Kingdom of Munster into Desmond and Thomond (, \\"North Munster\\"). It comprised all of what is now County Cork and most of County Kerry. Desmond was ruled by the Mac C√°rthaigh (MacCarthy) dynasty. Other clans within the kingdom included the O'Sullivans and O'Donovans. Following the Norman invasion of Ireland in the late 12th century, the eastern half of Desmond was conquered by the Anglo-Normans and became the Earldom of Desmond, ruled by the FitzGeralds and Fitzmaurices. The king of Desmond, Diarmaid Mac C√°rthaigh, submitted to Henry II of England, but the western half of Desmond lived on as a semi-independent Gaelic kingdom. It was often at war with the Anglo-Normans. F√≠nghin Mac Carthaigh's victory over the Anglo-Normans at the Battle of Callann (1261) helped preserve Desmond's independence. The kings of Desmond founded sites such as Blarney Castle, Ballycarbery Castle, Muckross Abbey and Kilcrea Friary. Following the Nine Years' War of the 1590s, Desmond became part of the Kingdom of Ireland. ==MacCarthy M√≥rs: Kings of Desmond== From its inception in 1118 through 1596, the Kingdom of Desmond was ruled by the family of the MacCarthy M√≥r, (i.e., the \\"Great MacCarthy\\"). For centuries the MacCarthy M√≥rs reigned as Kings of Desmond, and maintained significant demesne lands (manors) throughout the kingdom. Principal seats were at Pallis Castle (near present-day Killarney), Castle Lough (on Killarney's Lough Leane), and Ballycarbery Castle (near Cahersiveen on the Ring of Kerry).O'Laughlin, Michael C. Families of County Kerry, Ireland; Irish Genealogical Foundation; 1994; p. 21; After the death of King Donal IX MacCarthy M√≥r in 1596, and following the effective end of the Gaelic Order after the Battle of Kinsale (1602), the former Kingdom of Desmond was partitioned between County Cork and County Kerry (in 1606). Subsequent to the end of the MacCarthy M√≥r sovereignty in Desmond, descendants entitled to the highest Gaelic designation of \\"Chief of the Name\\" of the MacCarthy M√≥r family, are also properly styled as Princes of Desmond. A secondary title of the MacCarthy M√≥r would derive from the lordship designation of his sept. ==Principalities and other septs== Generational offshoots (cadet family lines) of the Royal House of Desmond received their own territories and titles ‚Äì known as appanages of the royal house. Those MacCarthy M√≥r cadet branches which did not evolve to the MacCarthy M√≥r chief-of-the-name status, became chiefs-of-the-name of their own princely septs, i.e. MacCarthy Reagh of Carbery, MacCarthy of Muskerry, and MacDonough MacCarthy of Duhallow. Because of their location, it was the MacCarthys of Muskerry and Carbery who ended up fighting the majority of the battles against the Normans ‚Äì mainly the FitzGerald Earls of Desmond ‚Äì while defending and expanding the Gaelic realms. By the mid-sixteenth century, the main line of the MacCarthys Mor had largely withdrawn to Kerry, so any modern claims that they are still entitled to the nominal overlordship of Carbery and Muskerry might be rejected by any extant descendants of these branches. ===Carbery=== Map adapted from: W.F. Butler; Pedigree and Succession of the House of MacCarthy M√≥r, With a Map; Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland; Vol. 51, May 1920; p.33. One of three principalities within the original Kingdom of Desmond, Carbery, under the MacCarthy Reagh dynasty founded by Donal Gott MacCarthy in the mid-13th century, achieved independence from the overlordship of the MacCarthy M√≥rs of Desmond. Thus, the MacCarthy territories were actually over a fourth again greater outside of Desmond proper, due to the independent and considerable principality of Carbery, directly to the south/southeast of Desmond. Principal seats of the Lords/Princes of Carbery were at Kilbrittain Castle (near Kinsale in County Cork), as well as Timoleague Castle (west of Kinsale). Possession of the latter was frequently in dispute with the Norman family of Barry, who were also prominent in West Cork. Some of the more notable sub-lordships under the MacCarthy Reagh dynasty of Carbery included castles at Ballydehob, Benduff, Downeen, Kilcoe, and Kilgobbin, to name but a few. ===Muskerry=== Blarney CastleThe MacCarthys of Muskerry, on the other hand, derived more recently from the MacCarthys M√≥r, and so were (and still are) considered a sept of the main dynasty. This principality of the Kingdom of Desmond began in the 14th century as an appanage of King Cormac M√≥r MacCarthy M√≥r (d. 1359) for his second son, Dermod. At various times, because of their adeptness at playing the political game with England, the Lords/Princes of Muskerry also bore various British titles, such as Earl of Clancarty, Viscount Mountcashel, and Baron (Lord) of Blarney. From its rebuilding in the late 15th century by Cormac Laidir MacCarthy, Blarney Castle, near to Cork city, was the principal seat of the MacCarthys of Muskerry. It was from alleged dialogue between Cormac Teige MacCarthy, the Lord of Blarney, and Queen Elizabeth I of England, that the term \\"blarney\\" was coined to mean \\"empty flattery\\" or \\"beguiling talk.\\" It is also from Blarney Castle that the legend of \\"kissing the Blarney Stone\\" derives. Among the numerous sub-infeudations/sub-lordships within the overlordship of the Princes of Muskerry, some of the major ones were: Ballea, Carrignamuck, Carrignavar, Castlecormac, Cloghroe, Cloghphillip, and Downyne. ===Duhallow=== The third of the princely lines that began as appanages of the MacCarthy M√≥r dynasty was that of the MacCarthys of Duhallow (), known as the MacDonough MacCarthys. The Duhallow sept began in the 13th century as an appanage from the then-King of Desmond, Cormac Fionn MacCarthy M√≥r (r. 1244‚Äì1248), to his son Diarmuid (Dermond). It was the Gaelic lordship(s) of Duhallow (and Coshmaing) that occupied the northern frontier of the MacCarthys of Desmond in their sometime struggles with the Norman family of the FitzGeralds, the Earls of Desmond. The principal seat of the Lords of Duhallow was at Kanturk. The family of the MacDonough MacCarthy Lords/Princes of Duhallow became extinct in the 18th century. As in the other princely appanages of Carbery and Muskerry, Duhallow held overlordship of a number of septs of both comital (ard tiarna) rank ‚Äì Clanawly, Clonmeen, and Dromagh ‚Äì as well as baronial (tiarna) rank ‚Äì e.g., Cappagh, Dromiscane, Kanturk, Kilbolane, Knocktemple, and Lohort, among others. ===Other septs=== ====Coshmaing==== The sept (clan) of Sliocht Eoghan of Coshmaing (\\"beside the River Maine\\") was established in the 14th century by King Cormac M√≥r MacCarthy M√≥r (d. 1359) for his third son, Eoghan, as an appanage of the royal house of Desmond. According to Butler, \\"Of the MacCarthy septs in the Barony of Magunihy, by far the most (88 to 105 ploughlands) was the Sliocht Eoghain Mhoir of Cois Mainge‚Ä¶. The lands of this sept stretched along the whole northern frontier of Magunihy from a point near Castlemaine to the border of Cork.\\"Butler, W. F.; Two Kerry Baronies in the Sixteenth Century; Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society; Part 1, Vol. XXXXiii, No. 137; January‚ÄìJune 1928; pp. 3‚Äì4. The head of Sliocht Eoghan of Coshmaing was styled as Lord (Ard Tiarna) of Coshmaing (English: Cosmaigne). The principal seat of the Coshmaing lordship was at Molahiffe, with other castles (sub-lordships) at Fieries and Clonmeallane.MacCarthy, Samuel Trant; The MacCarthys of Munster; Chapter XV, p. 266; Dundalk Press; Dundalk, Ireland; 1921 ====Non-MacCarthy septs==== Both inside and outside the territories of the Kingdom of Desmond in southwestern Ireland, there were many families other than the various septs of the MacCarthys. Most prominent of the Norman families in the area were the FitzGeralds (Earls of Desmond), FitzMaurices, Barrys, Barretts, and Roches. The chief non-MacCarthy Gaelic princes under the MacCarthy M√≥rs in Desmond were the O'Sullivans. After them were the O'Donoghues, and these two were the only septs who took part in the performance of the MacCarthy inauguration ceremonies ‚Äì i.e., the bestowal of the White Wand. Also prominent were the O'Callaghans, O'Keeffes, McAuliffes, O'Sheas, [O'Fearris, /O'Fearguis] and others. Within Carbery, aside from the MacCarthy Reaghs, the most prominent Gaelic families were the princely sept of the O'Donovans, the O'Mahonys, O'Driscolls, O'Dalys, and O'Crowleys. Within Muskerry, prominent non-MacCarthy Gaelic families included the MacSweeneys, O'Learys, O'Spaelains, O'Healys, and O'Riordans. ==See also== * Sliocht Cormaic of Dunguile * Earl of Clancarty * Lordship of Ireland ==Notes== ==References== * Butler, W.

Coursing was a common hunting technique, practised by the nobility, the landed and wealthy, as well as by commoners with sighthounds and lurchers. In its oldest recorded form in the Western world, as described by Arrian, it was a sport practised by all levels of society, which remained the case until Carolingian period forest law appropriated hunting grounds, or commons, for the king, the nobility, and other land owners. It then became a formalised competition, specifically on hare in Britain, practised under rules, the Laws of the Leash. As a zoological term, it refers to predation by running down prey over long distances, as opposed to stalking, in which a stealthy approach is followed by a short burst of sprinting. == Sport and hunting == Animals coursed in hunting and sport include hares, rabbits, foxes, deer of all sorts, antelope, gazelle, jackals, wolves. Jackrabbits and coyotes are the most common animals coursed in America. Competitive coursing in Ireland, the UK (until prohibition in 2004) Portugal and Spain has two dogs running against each other. In America, generally speaking three dogs are run together. The Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act and the Hunting Act 2004 (in England and Wales) made it illegal to course any type of mammal except rabbits and rats. Dogs are still permitted to chase (flush) game into the path of a waiting gun, as long as no more than two dogs are used. In Australia, dogs may be used to hunt feral animals such as foxes, deer, goats, rabbits and pigs. ==See also== *Hare coursing *Greyhound racing *Lure coursing ==References== ==Further reading== *Cox, Harding Edward de Fonblanque, Coursing and falconry 1899 *Steve Copold Hounds Hares & Other Creatures: The Complete Book of Coursing 1977/1996 *William Dansey Arrian On Coursing: the Cynegeticus London: J.

During this period, Boston officials had wide authority to ban works featuring \\"objectionable\\" content, and often banned works with sexual content or foul language. This even extended to the $5 bill from the 1896 \\"Educational\\" series of banknotes featuring allegorical figures which were partially nude. ==History== Boston was founded in the early 17th century by the Puritans, who held strict moral standards. Boston's second major wave of immigrants, Irish Catholics, began arriving in the 1820s and also held conservative moral beliefs, particularly regarding sex. Early instances of works being \\"banned in Boston\\" extend back at least to the year 1651. That year, William Pynchon, the founder of Springfield, Massachusetts‚ÄîMassachusetts' great settlement in the Connecticut River Valley‚Äîand the former treasurer of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, wrote a book criticizing Puritanism entitled The Meritorious Price of Our Redemption. Boston, founded by Puritans and, at that time, ruled as a de jure theocracy, banned Pynchon's book and pressed him to return to England. He did so in 1652, which nearly caused Springfield to align with the nearby Connecticut Colony. This reputation persisted throughout the Puritan era. In 1700 an objection to the religious doctrines of Increase Mather carried with it an advertisement that Boston publishers had refused to print it out of fear of Mather. This advertisement caused such an uproar in Boston that many half-hearted denials by Boston printers were collected and printed by Mather's party. The phrase \\"banned in Boston\\", however, originated in the late 19th century at a time when American \\"moral crusader\\" Anthony Comstock began a campaign to suppress vice. He found widespread support in Boston, particularly among socially- prominent and influential officials. Comstock was also known as the proponent of the Comstock Act, which prevented \\"obscene\\" materials from being delivered by the U.S. mail.The Comstock Act Following Comstock's lead, Boston's city officials took it upon themselves to ban anything that they found to be salacious, inappropriate, or offensive. Aiding them in their efforts was a group of private citizens, the Boston Watch and Ward Society. Theatrical shows were run out of town, books were confiscated, and motion pictures were prevented from being shown; sometimes movies were stopped mid-showing, after an official had \\"seen enough\\". In 1935, for example, during the opening performance of Clifford Odets' play Waiting for Lefty, four cast members were placed under arrest. This movement had several unintended consequences. One was that Boston, a cultural center since its founding, was perceived as less sophisticated than other cities without stringent censorship practices. Another was that the phrase \\"banned in Boston\\" became associated, in the popular mind, with something lurid, sexy, and naughty. Commercial distributors were often pleased when their works were banned in Boston‚Äîit gave them more appeal elsewhere. Prominent literary figure H. L. Mencken was arrested in Boston in 1926, after purposely selling a banned issue of his magazine The American Mercury. Though his case was dismissed by a local judge, and he later won a lawsuit against the Watch and Ward Society for illegal restraint of trade, the effort did little to affect censorship in Boston. The interracial romance novel Strange Fruit, by Lillian Smith, was also banned by the Watch and Ward Society and in 1929 Boston's mayor Malcolm Nichols and the city censor banned Eugene O'Neill's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Strange Interlude.\\"Strange Interlude Forbidden in Boston\\". Boston Herald, September 17, 1929, p. 1. During the same era there were also periodic \\"purity campaigns\\" on radio, as individual stations decided to ban songs with double- entendres or alleged vulgar lyrics. One victim of such a campaign was bandleader Joe Rines who, in November 1931, was cut off in mid-song by John L. Clark, program director of WBZ, for performing a number called \\"This is the Missus\\", whose lyrics Clark deemed inappropriate. Rines was indignant, saying he believed Clark was over-reacting to a totally innocent song, but Clark insisted he was right to ban any song whose lyrics might be construed as suggestive.\\"Purity Crusade Cuts Rines Off\\". Springfield (MA) Republican, November 25, 1931, p. 8. The Warren Court (1953‚Äì69) expanded civil liberties and in Memoirs v. Massachusetts and other cases curtailed the ability of municipalities to regulate the content of literature, plays, and movies. The last major literary censorship battle in the U.S. was fought over Naked Lunch, which was banned in Boston in 1965. Eventually the Watch and Ward Society changed its name to the New England Citizens Crime Commission, and made its main emphasis against gambling and drugs and far less on media. ==Works banned in Boston== * Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman (1881) * \\"$5 'Educational Series' Silver Certificate (1893, issued 1896) * The Decameron by Giovanni Boccaccio (1894) * Three Weeks by Elinor Glyn (1909) * Many Marriages by Sherwood Anderson (1923) * Antic Hay by Aldous Huxley (1923) * The American Mercury (magazine, April 1926) * Desire Under the Elms by Eugene O'Neill (play, 1926) * Elmer Gantry by Sinclair Lewis (1927) * An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser (1927) * The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway (1927) * Oil! by Upton Sinclair (1927) * Black April by Julia Peterkin (1927) * Manhattan Transfer by John Dos Passos (1927) * Mosquitoes by William Faulkner (1927) * Nigger Heaven by Carl Van Vechten (1927) * The World of William Clissold by H.

They thrive in small lakes and backwaters that provide an abundant supply of freshwater vegetation. ==Ecology== This species occurs in lakes, ponds, pools, and backwaters of large rivers, preferring large, slow-flowing or standing water bodies with vegetation. In the wild, grass carp spawn in fast-moving rivers, and their eggs, which are slightly heavier than water, develop while drifting downstream, kept in suspension by turbulence. The eggs are thought to die if they sink to the bottom.Krykhtin, M.L., and E.I. Gorbach. 1981. Reproductive ecology of the grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella, and the silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, in the Amur Basin. Journal of Ichthyology 21(2):109-123. Adults of the species feed primarily on aquatic plants. They feed on higher aquatic plants and submerged terrestrial vegetation, but may also take detritus, insects, and other invertebrates. ==Introduced species== Grass carp have been introduced to many countries around the world. In the Northern Hemisphere, countries and territories of introduction include Taiwan, Israel, Japan, the Philippines, the United States, Mexico, India, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Denmark, Sweden, Romania, Poland, Italy, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. In the Southern Hemisphere, they have been introduced to Argentina, Venezuela, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa. Grass carp are known to have spawned and established self-reproducing populations in only six of the many larger Northern Hemisphere rivers into which they have been stocked. Their failure to establish populations in other rivers suggests they have quite specific reproductive requirements.Rowe, D. K., & Schipper, C. M. (1985). An assessment of the impact of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon Idella) in New Zealand waters. Rotorua N.Z.: Fisheries Research Division, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. In the United States, the species was first imported in 1963 from Taiwan and Malaysia to aquaculture facilities in Alabama and Arkansas. The first release is believed to have been an accidental escape in 1966 from the US Fish and Wildlife Service's Fish Farming Experimental Station in Stuttgart, Arkansas, followed by planned introductions beginning in 1969. Subsequently, there have been widespread authorized, illegal, and accidental introductions; by the 1970s the species had been introduced to 40 states, and it has since been reported in 45 of the country's 50 states. In 2013 it was determined to be reproducing in the Great Lakes Basin. It is still stocked in many states as an effective biocontrol for undesirable aquatic vegetation, many species of which are themselves introduced. Grass carp require long rivers for the survival of the eggs and very young fish. ==Use as weed control== Healthy, live grass carp as seen from above Grass carp were introduced into New Zealand in 1966 to control the growth of aquatic plants. Unlike the other introduced fish brought to New Zealand, the potential value and impact of grass carp was investigated in secure facilities prior to their use in field trials.Grass carp in niwa.co.nz. They are now approved by the New Zealand government for aquatic weed control, although each instance requires specific authorization.\\"Grass carp for weed control\\", DOC In the Netherlands the species was also introduced, in 1973, to control over-abundant aquatic weeds. The release was controlled and regulated by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality. In both of these countries, control is made easier by the fact that grass carp are very unlikely to naturally reproduce because of their very specific breeding requirements, but elsewhere control is obtained by the use of sterile, triploid fish.\\"Triploid Grass Carp Information\\", texas.gov ==Fishing for grass carp== A grass carp caught on monofilament fishing line Grass carp grow large and are strong fighters on a rod and reel, but because of their vegetarian habits and their wariness, they can be difficult to catch.Catching Grass Carp .

It had been a major Irish community. ==Education== The area is served by Washwood Heath Academy. For the younger population, there is a children's centre. ==Politics== The ward is represented on Birmingham City Council by three councillors: Mariam Khan, Ansar Ali Khan and Mohammed Idrees, all Labour. ===Project Champion=== Project Champion was a project to install a ¬£3m network of 169 Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras to monitor vehicles entering and leaving Washwood Heath and Sparkbrook. Its implementation was frozen in June 2010 amid allegations that the police deliberately misled councillors about its purpose, after it was revealed that it was being funded as an anti-terrorism initiative, rather than for 'reassurance and crime prevention'.Police under fire over Muslim CCTV surveillance scheme, The Guardian, published 2010-06-18.

The Ward End Works covered an area of upon completion. A distinctive feature was the Bromford House administrative block, with its fa√ßade fronting onto Drews Lane. The factory was an assembly plant and before the outbreak of hostilities produced a light car called the Stellite. During its first four years, the factory also produced munitions fuses and shell cases for soldiers fighting in mainland Europe during World War I. When the war was over, Vickers, the owners of Electric & Ordnance Accessories Company Ltd, put the factory under the ownership of another subsidiary Wolseley Motors on 30 September 1919. After the change in ownership, Wolseley replaced the small workshop sheds with a large assembly building. Wolseley began to encounter difficulties in the 1920s and it was saved after being purchased by William Morris. As a result of the purchase, car manufacturing was completely moved from the Adderley Park site, which became Morris Commercials, to the Ward End Works. Engines for the Morris Minor were also produced at the factory during the 1930s alongside the Wolseley production line. When World War II broke out in 1939 the factory became the production base for tanks and military vehicles as well as mines. In 1941, it also began to produce the Horsa glider. By the end of the war, ¬£500,000 worth of damage had been inflicted on the plant by the Luftwaffe in raids in 1941 and 1942. In 1939 a new factory for the Morris Motors Pressing Branch was constructed on the Common Lane side of the Ward End Works. This was renamed Nuffield Metal Products in 1945. Production of Wolseley cars recommenced on 4 September 1945. In 1948 the works began to encounter new problems and it was seen to be more efficient for production of new Morrises to be moved to Cowley in Oxford. By the 1950s, production was centred at Cowley and the Ward End Works were used in the productions of Nuffield Group products. Following the formation of the British Motor Corporation in 1952, parts were also made there for Austin-Healey Sprite, and the Wolseley 1500/Riley 1.5 twins. The formation of British Leyland resulted in the plant being redesignated the Austin Morris division's Transmission Plant. 4,400 workers were employed on site. When the Adderley Park plant closed in 1972 all vehicle production was moved to the Common Lane works. During the mid-1980s there was a fire at the factory however no other problems surfaced. In 1989 Freight Rover became Leyland-DAF Vans, which then became the LDV Group in 1993. Today the site covers and is in the ownership of LDV with Bromford House being used as the company's headquarters. The works have since been demolished. The former Metro-Cammell and Leyland DAF Vans sites are to be redeveloped as a High Speed 2 depot.Former home of Alstom and van manufacturer LDV will become new rail maintenance depot for HS2 Birmingham Mail 6 February 2018 ==References== *2001 Population Census results for Washwood Heath *2001 Population Census results theme tables *Councillors' Advice Bureaux ‚Äì Washwood Heath Ward *Washwood Heath ward profile *Washwood Heath industrial history ==External links== *Birmingham City Council: Washwood Heath Ward Category:Areas of Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Former wards of Birmingham, West Midlands Category:United Kingdom in World War I Category:United Kingdom in World War II ","title":"Washwood Heath"},{"id":"845052","text":"Stockland Green is an area of Birmingham, England.

Heath made his home for his entire life at his family‚Äôs farm in Roxbury, Massachusetts (present day Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, part of the city of Boston). He was born on a farm that had been settled in 1636 by his ancestors. He became active in the militia, and was a captain of the Roxbury Company of the Suffolk County militia regiment in 1760. By 1770 he was the regiment's colonel and its commanding officer. In 1765 he was elected as a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts and was elected as the Company's lieutenant in 1768 and as its captain in 1770. In December 1774 the revolutionary government in Massachusetts commissioned him as a brigadier general. He commanded Massachusetts forces during the last stage of the Battle of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. As the siege of Boston began, Heath devoted himself to training the militia involved in the siege. In June of that year, Massachusetts named him a major general in the state troops, and the Continental Congress commissioned him a brigadier general in the newly formed Continental Army. In 1776 Heath participated in the defense of New York City, and was one of those who urged General Washington not to abandon the city. He saw action at Long Island, Harlem Heights, and White Plains. In August 1776 he was promoted to major general in the Continental Army, but Washington had doubts about Heath's abilities and posted him where no action was expected. In November he was placed in command of forces in the Hudson River Highlands. In January 1777, Washington instructed Heath to attack Fort Independence in New York in support of Washington's actions at Trenton and Princeton, but Heath's attack was botched and his troops were routed. He was censured by Washington and thereafter was never given command of troops in combat. General Heath was placed in charge of the Convention Army of John Burgoyne‚Äôs surrendered troops after the Battle of Saratoga. In 1780 he returned to command the Highland Department after Benedict Arnold‚Äôs treason. Heath was listed as an original member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati. After the war, Heath was a member of the Massachusetts Convention that ratified the United States Constitution in 1788. He served in the state Senate 1791-1792, and as a probate court judge. In 1806 he was elected the Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, but declined the office. He died at home in Roxbury on January 24, 1814, and was buried nearby in Forest Hills Cemetery The town of Heath, Massachusetts, is named in his honor. ==References== *Boatner, Mark Mayo, III.

Here a metric (or Riemannian) connection is a connection which preserves the metric tensor. More precisely: > Fundamental Theorem of Riemannian Geometry. Let (M, g) be a Riemannian > manifold (or pseudo-Riemannian manifold). Then there is a unique connection > ‚àá which satisfies the following conditions: *for any vector fields X, Y, Z > we have ::\\\\partial_X \\\\langle Y,Z \\\\rangle = \\\\langle abla_X Y,Z \\\\rangle + > \\\\langle Y, abla_X Z \\\\rangle, :where \\\\partial_X \\\\langle Y,Z \\\\rangle > denotes the derivative of the function \\\\langle Y,Z \\\\rangle along vector > field X. *for any vector fields X, Y, :: abla_XY- abla_YX=[X,Y], :where > [X, Y] denotes the Lie bracket for vector fields X, Y. The first condition means that the metric tensor is preserved by parallel transport, while the second condition expresses the fact that the torsion of ‚àá is zero. An extension of the fundamental theorem states that given a pseudo- Riemannian manifold there is a unique connection preserving the metric tensor with any given vector-valued 2-form as its torsion. The difference between an arbitrary connection (with torsion) and the corresponding Levi-Civita connection is the contorsion tensor. The following technical proof presents a formula for Christoffel symbols of the connection in a local coordinate system. For a given metric this set of equations can become rather complicated. There are quicker and simpler methods to obtain the Christoffel symbols for a given metric, e.g. using the action integral and the associated Euler-Lagrange equations. ==Geodesics defined by a metric or a connection== A metric defines the curves which are geodesics ; but a connection also defines the geodesics (see also parallel transport). A connection \\\\bar{ abla} is said to be equal to another abla in two different ways: *obviously if \\\\bar{ abla}_X Y = abla_X Y for every pair of vectors fields X,Y *if abla and \\\\bar{ abla} define the same geodesics and have the same torsion This means that two different connections can lead to the same geodesics while giving different results for some vector fields. Because a metric also defines the geodesics of a differential manifold, for some metric there is not only one connection defining the same geodesics (some examples can be found of a connection on \\\\mathbb{R}^3 leading to the straight lines as geodesics but having some torsion in contrary to the trivial connection on \\\\mathbb{R}^3, i.e. the usual directional derivative) , and given a metric, the only connection which defines the same geodesics (which leaves the metric unchanged by parallel transport) and which is torsion-free is the Levi-Civita connection (which is obtained from the metric by differentiation). ==Proof of the theorem== Let m be the dimension of M and, in some local chart, consider the standard coordinate vector fields :{\\\\partial}_i = \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^i}, \\\\qquad i=1,\\\\dots,m. Locally, the entry gij of the metric tensor is then given by :g_{i j} = \\\\left \\\\langle {\\\\partial}_i, {\\\\partial}_j \\\\right \\\\rangle. To specify the connection it is enough to specify, for all i, j, and k, :\\\\left \\\\langle abla_{\\\\partial_i}\\\\partial_j, \\\\partial_k \\\\right \\\\rangle. We also recall that, locally, a connection is given by m3 smooth functions :\\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\Gamma^l {}_{ij} \\\\right \\\\\\\\}, where : abla_{\\\\partial_i} \\\\partial_j = \\\\sum_l \\\\Gamma^l_{ij} \\\\partial _l. The torsion-free property means : abla_{ \\\\partial _i} \\\\partial _j = abla_{\\\\partial_j} \\\\partial_i. On the other hand, compatibility with the Riemannian metric implies that : \\\\partial_k g_{ij} = \\\\left \\\\langle abla_{\\\\partial_k}\\\\partial_i, \\\\partial_j \\\\rangle + \\\\langle \\\\partial_i, abla_{\\\\partial_k} \\\\partial_j \\\\right \\\\rangle. For a fixed, i, j, and k, permutation gives 3 equations with 6 unknowns. The torsion free assumption reduces the number of variables to 3. Solving the resulting system of 3 linear equations gives unique solutions :\\\\left \\\\langle abla_{ \\\\partial_i }\\\\partial_j, \\\\partial_k \\\\right \\\\rangle = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\left ( \\\\partial_i g_{jk}- \\\\partial_k g_{ij} + \\\\partial_j g_{ik} \\\\right ). This is the first Christoffel identity. Since :\\\\left \\\\langle abla_{ \\\\partial_i }\\\\partial_j, \\\\partial_k \\\\right \\\\rangle = \\\\Gamma^l _{ij} g_{lk}, where we use Einstein summation convention. That is, an index repeated subscript and superscript implies that it is summed over all values. Inverting the metric tensor gives the second Christoffel identity: :\\\\Gamma^l_{ij} = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\left ( \\\\partial_i g_{jk}- \\\\partial_k g_{ij} + \\\\partial_j g_{ik} \\\\right ) g^{kl}. Once again, with Einstein summation convention. The resulting unique connection is called the Levi-Civita connection. ==The Koszul formula== An alternative proof of the Fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry proceeds by showing that a torsion-free metric connection on a Riemannian manifold is necessarily given by the Koszul formula: :\\\\begin{array}{ll}2 g( abla_XY, Z) &=\\\\, X (g(Y,Z)) + Y (g(X,Z)) - Z (g(X,Y)) \\\\\\\\\\\\&\\\\quad+\\\\, g([X,Y],Z) - g([X,Z],Y) - g([Y,Z],X),\\\\end{array} where the vector field X acts naturally on smooth functions on the Riemannian manifold (so that Xf = \\\\partial_X f). Assuming the existence of a connection that is symmetric, abla_X Y - abla_Y X = [X,Y], and compatible with the metric, Xg(Y,Z) =g( abla_X Y,Z) + g(Y, abla_X Z), the sum Xg(Y,Z) + Yg(X,Z) -Zg(Y,X) can be simplified using the symmetry property. This results in the Koszul formula. The expression for g( abla_X Y,Z) therefore uniquely determines abla_X Y. Conversely the Koszul formula can be used to define abla_X Y and it is routine to verify that abla_X is an affine connection, which is symmetric and compatible with the metric . (The right hand side defines a vector field because it is -linear in the variable Z.) ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:Connection (mathematics) Category:Theorems in Riemannian geometry Category:Articles containing proofs ","title":"Fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry"},{"id":"845062","text":"The Spring Mountains are a mountain range of Southern Nevada in the United States, running generally northwest-southeast along the west side of Las Vegas and south to the border with California. Most land in the mountains is owned by the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management and managed as the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area within the Humboldt- Toiyabe National Forest and the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. ==Geography== The Spring Mountains range is named for the number of springs to be found, many of them in the recesses of Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, which is on the eastern side of the mountains. The Spring Mountains divide the Pahrump Valley and Amargosa River basins from the Las Vegas Valley watershed, which drains into the Colorado River watershed, by way of Las Vegas Wash into Lake Mead, thus the mountains define part of the boundary of the Great Basin. The Great Basin Divide, (one of the Great Basin region borders) continues north through the Indian Springs Pass region, then turns due east at the perimeter mountain ranges north of Las Vegas. ===Mount Charleston=== View of Mount Charleston (village) in Kyle Canyon.

The area is typically 30-40 ¬∞F cooler than the valleys below, and it is a popular getaway for Las Vegas residents and visitors. The Lee Canyon (Ski and Snowboard Resort) lies in Lee Canyon on State Highway 156. ===Other peaks=== In addition to Mount Charleston, other major summits in the Spring Mountains range include Bonanza Peak, McFarland Peak, Mummy Mountain, Griffith Peak, Bridge Mountain, Mount Wilson and Mount Potosi. == Biological diversity == The Spring Mountains are a sky island ecosystem. With an area around , and a vertical range of nearly , the mountains encompass a wide variety of habitats, and the biological diversity is probably greater than anywhere else in Nevada; 37 species of trees are known (more than any other Nevadan range), and 600 species of vascular plants have been reported from the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area alone. The bases of the mountains are part of the Mojave zone dominated by creosote bush and white bursage, then rising to a blackbush scrub zone, followed by a pygmy conifer zone with juniper, pinyon pine, and mountain mahogany, and topped by a montane zone with many species of conifers around Mt.

Forming the larger part of the ward of Longbridge And West Heath it is situated between Kings Norton, Northfield, Longbridge and Cofton Hackett and lies on traditional heathland formed in the 13th century as part of the Kings Norton manorial lands, and was historically in Worcestershire. Based on a small village formed in the early 1900s that was originally centred on the medieval Lilley Lane, the majority of West Heath's expansion and growth took place just after World War II. The original expansion in the 1940s and 1950s consisted of large numbers of prefab houses, most of which were eventually replaced by permanent housing estates in the 1960s and 1970s. There are a number of buildings in West Heath that date to the 19th century and earlier. The suburb is adjacent to rural Worcestershire and a number of public footpaths allow open access to the surrounding fields up to Hopwood, Cofton Hackett and the Lickey Hills. ==History== ===Early history=== In early Anglo- Saxon times, West Heath lay at the northernmost border of the lands of the Hwicce, a people which occupied the former territory of the British tribe, The Dobunni. As part of what would become Kings Norton, West Heath was positioned slightly to the north of the boundary between two tribes, the Pencersaetan and the Tomsaetan.Hooke Della \\"The Anglo-Saxon Landscape The Kingdom Of The Hwicce\\" page 85-6 Manchester University Press 1985 There is evidence of the previous presence of Romans in West Heath ‚Äì in 1949, Roman coins of the reign of Emperor Hadrian were unearthed in Coney Green Drive in the Austin Village and there was a further discovery of coins of the reign of the Emperor Diocletian in 1966 in Hawkesley Drive, also in the Austin Village. One of the earliest mentions of West Heath is in the Saxon lease of land at Coston Hackett in 849 AD detailing a grant by Worcester's Bishop Ealhhun to King Berhtwulf, King of Mercia. West Heath and parts of Kings Norton would remain part of Coston Hackett manor estates as late as the early 20th century. West Heath was mentioned in the manorial court roll of Bromsgrove and Kings Norton in 1267 when it was recorded that \\"Richard de Co≈øton has a purpresture (i.e. an enclosure of tenants land or an enclosure of waste land) upon Westhethe, Richard de Co≈øton holds four acres in Westhethe and does nothing in service to the King. Alexander and Gregory de Co≈øton hold land in Westhethe, Master John de Aluvechurch as (sic) 1 and half acres of purpresture upon \\"La Westhethe\\" by permission of Robert de Co≈øton\\". In 1494 it was recorded that \\"Baldwin Lyndon ‚Äì banks in ruins between Hawkesley Pole and Westhethe...fined 2d\\" whilst the Abbot of Bordesley was fined 8d \\"through defect in cleansing the banks at West Hethe\\". In 1596, a woman called Joan was fined 6d because \\"she enclosed a parcel of the King's waste at West Heath\\".Goodger Helen. \\"Kings Norton\\", page 66. Brewin Books 1990 Turves Green was known as Turvosland in 1490 and was the site for peat-cutting for fuel. There is a layer of peat a few feet below the surface and deeper still are successive layers of clay and a coal seam and a bloomerie has been discovered ‚Äì this is the first form of forge for smelting iron from ore leaving less bulk to transport for further smelting to refine the metal.Poulton-Smith E. \\"Worcestershire Place Names\\", page 116. Sutton Publishing, 2003. In 1442 Turves Green had been named Le Grene Slave, Greenway Lane in 1780 and Green Lane in 1877. During the English Civil War West Heath was on the border between royalist Worcestershire and parliamentary Warwickshire and there were regular minor skirmishes and conflicts between the forces of the two opposing sides. Situated off Turves Green, Hawkesley House, which belonged to the royalist George Middlemore and his family, was besieged and seized by parliamentary forces under Colonel Tinker Fox in April 1644. The Parliamentarians fortified the building but on 13 May 1645 Royalist forces under the king‚Äôs nephews Prince Rupert and Prince Maurice laid siege to Hawkesley House and were joined the following day by King Charles I who had been staying at nearby Cofton Hall. The Royalists took the house on 16 May and expelled the Parliamentary forces and razed the house to the ground.Mason Henry \\"The Austin Village\\", page 65. publisher unnamed. 2007 The inhabitants of West Heath would also have been aware of other clashes close by during the Civil War. Two miles away at Kings Norton Prince Rupert with eight troops of horses and 300 foot soldiers was engaged on 17 October 1642 on Kings Norton Green by a Parliamentary force of 800 foot soldiers and horsemen on its way to join the Earl of Essex at Worcester. The Royalists were routed by the Parliamentarians under Lord Willoughby Of Parham and fifty Royalist troops were killed and buried in a unmarked grave in King‚Äôs Norton Churchyard. On 10 July 1643 Queen Henrietta Maria arrived in Kings Norton with 3000 horsemen, 30 companies of foot soldiers and artillery and camped there en route to Oxford where she planned to join King Charles. She passed the night in the ‚ÄòSaracen‚Äôs Head‚Äô while the location of the site where the soldiers camped is said to be where ‚ÄòThe Camp‚Äô public house is now located. This historic association with the Civil War is marked by the naming of several roads in West Heath such as Fairfax Road, Cropredy Road, Edgehill Road and a public house named \\"The Cavalier\\" on Fairfax Rd. William Middlemore rebuilt Hawkesley House in 1654 but by the 19th century its status was simply that of a farm house, called Hawkesley Farm, until it was demolished in 1957. A municipal block of flats ‚Äì ‚ÄòMoat House‚Äô ‚Äì was built on the spot of the original Hawkesley House in 1971. The ancient moat can still be seen near Moat House. From earliest times, what is now known as West Heath Road had been a trackway until 1796 when it was surfaced to become part of the Stourbridge to Wooten Wawen turnpike road. It remained a turnpike until 1820 with a toll-house at the junction of what are now Alvechurch and Redhill Roads, recorded in 1813.Richards Peter. \\"The History Of Northfield\\", page 13. Northfield Library 1986. National censuses for the 19th century reveal that the inhabitants were principally farmers, agricultural labourers or nail-makers. West Heath formed a part of Kings Norton, linking Kings Norton isthmus-like to Rednal which was also part of the district and the area was principally used as livestock grazing land. The land was jealously guarded ‚Äì in the fifteenth century, during the reign of Edward IV, the manor court ruled that \\"No man shall take in foreign cattle to keep on the common\\" and in 1641, John Brookes of Cofton Hackett was fined five shillings for keeping a great flock of sheep on the common, \\"being a foreigner\\". Alan The Bailiff in the fifteenth century, had been charged to \\"drive\\" the common two or three times a year to discover the nature of the stock being pastured there and to ensure that no-one should keep above five colts, horses or mares upon the common. Inhabitants were sometimes fined for \\"encroaching\\" (enclosing small areas) on the common although these may actually have been payments to regularise a new practice rather than a form of punishment. After the Civil War, a Parliamentary Survey of \\"The Manor of Kingsesnorton\\" produced in 1649 because the manor \\"was in the hands of Parliament by reason of the seizure of the lands of King Charles I\\", reported that \\"The soil of the heaths, wastes, and commons called.... West Heath, and the archery (and all of them do contain in the whole by estimate of 3,000 acres or thereabouts) are the lord's and the trees thereon growing and \\"the bitt\\" belong to the tenants\\". By the 19th century there was considerable local poverty and those who lived on Cofton Common were described as \\"peasants\\" in a reminiscence of Alice Impey who lived at Longbridge House Day Leonard G. \\"Down Memory Lane\\" Occasional Paper No. 14, page 9. The Northfield Society 1983 and who recalled that when someone died there it was necessary for her father to send a cart for the body to be taken to Cofton Church and buried in the pauper's section of the graveyard. ===Nail making in West Heath=== Apart from agriculture, nail making was the most notable industry in 19th century West Heath. Numbers of nailers in West Heath are included in figures for Northfield and in the whole district there were 122 employed in the industry in 1831. However the industry was already in decline ‚Äì in 1841 there were 74 nailers and in 1884 there were only twenty three with only seven in West Heath. Nailers' workshops were present at Groveley, West Heath and Turves Green; the latter was still the site of hand-made nail production by Mr. Withers in Oak Tree Cottages as late as 1910 although the factory of The Patent Hob Nail & Rivet Company had been opened in Station Road in 1900. The nailers' workshops were usually little lean-to sheds built against the sides of the cottages with a brick-built small furnace.Day Leonard G. \\"Down memory Lane\\" Occasional Paper No. 14, page 10. The Northfield Society 1983. ===20th century residents=== As well drained open heath land, the area was not developed as a residential area until the early 1900s, containing only a few scattered agricultural buildings and latterly one or two grand houses in the Lilley Lane area. In 1907 Kelly's Directory Of BirminghamAlan Godfrey Maps. \\"Old Ordnance Survey Maps Northfield South 1903\\" records that several middle class residents were living in the larger houses of West Heath including two professors of chemistry at the new University of Birmingham ‚Äì Percy Faraday Frankland F.R.S. (son of Edward Frankland, an eminent scientist who discovered chemical valency and also godson of the famous physicist, Michael Faraday) lived at The Dell and Adrian John Brown F.R.S. (whose chair at the university was actually that of Malting and Brewing and who became a pioneer in enzyme kinetics) who lived with his family in West Heath House, which was the largest residence in the village but was demolished to make way for an Elderly Person's Home, situated at the junction of Alvechurch Road and Cofton Road. The replacement 1950's building was closed and demolished in 2016 and a newly built, 3 storey, 80 bedroom Residential Home, called \\"Austin Rose\\", was opened in Autumn 2017. Groveley Hall was occupied by Mrs. Fanny Jolly, whose father, J. Billing Baldwin, an industrialist in Kings Norton, had bought the house in 1872 from the son of John Merry, who in turn had purchased the house in 1820. The earliest building on the site probably dated back to 1530 and had been a religious institution belonging to Westbury College in Bristol but it had been confiscated as a result of The Reformation and handed to Sir Ralph Sadler, Secretary of State to King Henry VIII, in 1536. In 1548 the property was bought by John Coombes and later by John Lyttleton and after 1600 by Francis Heaton. In the early nineteenth century the house belonged to Robert Middleton Biddulph from whose family the Merrys obtained the property.Richards Peter. \\"The History Of Northfield\\" page 15-16. Northfield Library 1986. Elsewhere in West Heath, Lieutenant Meynell Hunt lived at Groveley House and the only houses on Cofton Common which are mentioned in the Directory were both owned by women ‚Äì Mrs. Higgins at Fern Bank and Mrs. Avery. The surname Hobbis had been particularly common in the area in the 19th century and people with that name included farmers, agricultural workers and (in Kings Norton village) the publican of the inn, The Plumber's Arms, but no-one named Hobbis is listed in the 1907 Directory as owning property in West Heath although a small piece of land in what is now Alvechurch Road was known as Hobbis' Piece and was then owned by Adam Webb, chief clerk in an assurance company, another solid middle class inhabitant of that time in West Heath. The only farmer recorded to be living in Turves Green in the late nineteenth century censuses was Thomas Morris, born in 1865, but in 1907 he was mentioned in Kelly's Directory as either living at Longbridge or Staple Old Road. In 1874, the Impey family moved from Edgbaston to Longbridge House, which had been Prince Rupert's headquarters during the siege of Hawlesley House in 1645 during the Civil War. Frederick Impey was a partner in Messrs White and Pikes which owned a printing works in Moor Street in Birmingham and which was developing a method of colour printing on to tin. Impey opened a factory in the area to carry out this process but it was burned down in 1900 and not reopened. Herbert Austin subsequently bought the site to build a premises for motor car manufacture. In 1910, the Impeys moved to \\"The Island\\", a large house in West Heath situated between Turves Green and West Heath Road, but moved away when Frederick Impey died in 1920. Like the Cadbury family who lived in neighbouring Northfield, the Impeys were Quakers and as well as being important developers of local industry, showed considerable interest in improving the lot of their factory workers.Richards Peter \\"The History Of Northfield\\", page 19. Northfield library 1986. The first post office in West Heath was opened on 5 June 1892 although the 1891 census records a rural postman, John Cook, to be living in West Heath. Mail was cancelled with the village's name by the use of a rubber canceller. The first postmaster of West Heath was William A. Jarvis who was recorded in the 1901 English census as also being a grocer at 37 West Heath Lane, the post office having been opened at that address in 1899 in the newly built \\"West Villas\\" and this co-incided with the post office becoming a money office and savings bank on 1 May of that year. Jarvis's wife, Sarah, was described as \\"Postmistress\\" in 1901 and Jarvis remained the postmaster until 1912 by which time West Heath Lane had been renamed as Alvechurch Road and West Villas had been allocated the address of no. 53 Alvechurch Road.Kelly's Directory Of Birmingham 1912 West Heath post office's status changed from that of rural post office to a town sub-post office on 20 August 1916. ===Hospital=== West Heath Hospital was established as an infectious diseases hospital in 1889, became a tuberculosis hospital in 1910 and was refocused as a geriatric hospital in 1980. ===Expansion=== In 1900 visitors arriving via Northfield railway station could visit the skating rink on West Heath Road next to the bridge over the river Rea. Unfortunately the skating rink was used during the First World War as a munitions factory and following an accident the rink was destroyed by fire. In the 1930s small terraced houses that were built along Alvechurch Road and Sir Hilton's Road, and slightly grander semi-detached and detached houses, along West Heath Road and Redditch Road began to change the traditional rural nature of West Heath. The newer high density housing estates built two decades later would complete the change. The rapid expansion of West Heath and its transition from open farm land to residential suburb of Birmingham had commenced in the years immediately after the Second World War when several extensive estates of pre-fab houses were quickly erected to house returning servicemen and families made homeless during wartime bombing raids. Aerial photograph of the Bath Tub open air lido on Alvechurch Road, West Heath, pictured in the summer of 1938 Another notable building of the area was The Bath Tub open air lido (now demolished), opened on 1 July 1937 in Alvechurch Road, where 20,000 people had gathered to watch the opening ceremony by Gracie Fields with Mantovani and his orchestra and the M.P. for Northfield and Kings Norton, Ronald Cartland, the brother of Dame Barbara Cartland, the novelist. The lido which had been built by Percy Hollier who intended it to be \\"Birmingham's brightest entertainment spot\\" and which included a 180 feet by 90 feet sized swimming pool as well as a putting green, lawn for archery and a children's playground, only operated for 3 years and was closed due to commercial failure.Richards Peter. \\"The History Of Northfield\\", page 5. Northfield Library 1986Caswell Pauline. \\"Images Of England Northfield\\", page128. Tempus Publishing Ltd 1996 Laughtons took over the site with Eddystone Radio during the war when its rural location helped it to avoid attack by German air raids. The lido site is now covered by a housing estate. There is also the art deco Man On The Moon pub on Redditch Road, which was built in 1937 (originally as The Man In The Moon but the name was changed in 1969 to commemorate the first moon landing). Prior to 1938, when a school was opened in Turves Green, children had attended St. Anne's Church School in West Heath. The headmistress of that school, Miss Mary Davies, was appointed to be headmistress at Turves Green where a junior school was first opened and then, in 1939, a school for seniors.Mason Henry \\"The Austin Village\\", page 80. Publisher unnamed. 2007 A Catholic Primary School linked to the parish of St. John Fisher was opened in Alvechurch Road on 5 September 1961 on the remaining part of an industrial estate next to Hobbis' Piece to accommodate the large number of local children of Irish Catholic origin (at the time 60% of children attending the school passed their summer holidays in Ireland). A tree was donated to the school by the Birmingham Tree Lovers charity but was cut down in 2010 to make way for a car park. In the 1950s the population of West Heath continued to increase and change considerably. Working-class families who had lived in central Birmingham in old unsuitable properties which were to be demolished and a considerable number of Irish immigrant families settled in the new homes on the newly built council estates around Cofton Common and the land between it and Turves Green. Local work was plentiful, especially at the Austin Motor Works at Longbridge and, for the women, at Cadbury's chocolate factory in Bournville or the Kalamazoo paper factory in Longbridge, which had been moved to the area by Oliver Morland and F. Paul Impey in 1913 from central Birmingham.Caswell Pauline. \\"Images Of England Northfield\\", page 109. Tempus Publishing Ltd. 1996. ==West Heath today== ===Services=== Prefab homes built in 1945 and still in use West Heath has a small but busy shopping area in Alvechurch Road and there is an Art Deco building which previously housed a Co-Operative store which closed in 2018. Other facilities include an award- winning Bangladeshi-style restaurant, a Chinese Food Takeaway shop, a Fish and Chip shop, two pharmacies and an optician's shop. A small supermarket was opened in the building which housed the former public house, 'The Fordrough'. The post office is still located at \\"West Villas\\" on Alvechurch Road. Located on West Heath Road is a primary health care centre, built in 2011, replacing the former surgery which had been situated in a 1930's detached house neighbouring the previous residence of a former general practitioner, Dr Anthony (Antek) Bobak who had set up his practice in 1954. Another general practitioner's surgery, that of Dr. Shan, was located for many years in Alvechurch Road. A children's nursery is also located in West Heath Road . There are other doctors' surgeries and nurseries in the area. West Heath Hospital is located in Rednal Road and nearby, in Ivyhouse Road, there is a rehabilitation hospital for people with brain injury . There are two elderly persons' homes, primary schools, a community centre in Hampstead House (a second community centre, Oddingley Hall, is actually situated in Kings Norton), recreation grounds and other basic facilities. West Heath library, previously situated near the former Fordrough public house off West Heath Road, was closed by Birmingham City Council in January 2014 despite a vigorous local community-based campaign to fight the closure. More than 110 local residents attended a public protest outside the library building on 12 April 2014 to further the aims of the campaign against closure. At the meeting the local Labour councillor strenuously reassured the campaigners that a local library service would continue but an announcement by Labour-run Birmingham City Council, made in mid-February 2016, revealed that plans for a new building had been withdrawn and that a library may be opened in the future elsewhere. Subsequently, on 9 April 2016, a rally of 50 people including the Member of Parliament for Northfield, the Leader of Birmingham City Council and the three Northfield City Councillors, was held at the site of the old West Heath library to call for a new building to be constructed on this site but nothing came of this. The area is now served by a weekly mobile library service. Before moving to the Fordrough, there was a library situated next to St Anne's Church in a prefabricated building on Lilley Lane. ===Events=== For many years an annual West Heath Flower And Produce Show was held at the beginning of September. It was originally held at St. Anne's Church Hall but from the 77th Show in 2011 it was located in Hampstead House in Condover Road, West Heath's Community Centre. The holding of the annual Flower And Produce Show has now been discontinued. There is an annual West Heath Art Exhibition held at Hampstead House. An annual summer fete for the local community is held in June at Hampstead House. An annual West Heath Beer and Cider festival is held at Hampstead House usually in late September or early October. The ‚ÄòVelo Birmingham 2019‚Äô cycling event passed through West Heath on 13 May 2019 when cyclists rode through the area along Rednal Road, up Lilley Lane, around West Heath green and along Cofton Road and Groveley Lane. The same event was to have taken place in 2020 but was cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic. ===The area=== There is a green which forms an island around which the roads from Kings Norton to Rednal and Northfield to Alvechurch pass and at the centre of which is a large and old oak tree. The green is planted with bulbs which provide a colourful display in spring. On either side of the green are St. John Fisher church and St. Anne's church as well as a residential home for the elderly and new housing. There is also a very large oak tree situated at the corner of Longbridge Lane and Groveley Lane which has been named \\"The Cofton Oak\\" and which was the subject of a campaign to preserve it when it was threatened by plans to have it removed. Council estates were constructed after 1945, both at West Heath and Turves Green. Both areas feature a large number of terraces and semi-detached houses with some Tower blocks at Fairfax Road which latterly have become known as 'The Poets' Blocks', each being named after a famous British poet (Shakespeare, Wordsworth and Tennyson). The first flats to be built in West Heath were 3 six storey blocks in Turves Green constructed in 1952 by Deeley for the then Birmingham County Borough Council in an Art Deco style. The three blocks, Oxford House, Aylesbury House and Buckingham House, were demolished in 1999. A high-density private estate was built on the former grounds of West Heath Hospital. Turves Green at one time had nine residential towers, several blocks of low-rise flats, and an estate of pre-fabricated bungalows and brick semi-detached houses, known as the Austin Village, which was built in 1916 to house First World War munitions workers. The Austin Village has been a Conservation area from the early 1990s but in 2019 Birmingham City Council decided to withdraw its special status though it has extended the time allowed for an appeal against this decision in the face of a campaign led by the Austin Village Preservation Society. West Heath Park is located at the north-east boundary of West Heath with Kings Norton. Amenities include children's recreation facilities and football pitches and nearby is Oddingley Hall, the second of West Heath's Community centres, though this is located in Kings Norton. Cofton Park, where Pope Benedict XVI attended a service for the beatification of Cardinal John Henry Newman on 19 September 2010, is situated within the boundaries of the new Longbridge and West Heath Ward. Various public events are held in the park. ==Governance== ===Historical=== Historically, in the Middle Ages West Heath was part of the upper division of Halfshire Hundred that also contained Bromsgrove, Coston Hackett, Dodderhill, Doverdale, Droitwich, Elmbridge, Feckenham, Hadsor, Hampton Lovett, Kington, Kings Norton, Northfield, Salwarpe, Tardebigge and Upton Warren. However, West Heath was incorporated in the City of Birmingham in 1911 when the Kings Norton and Northfield Urban District Council was abolished. ===Westminster=== The area is in the Birmingham Northfield parliamentary constituency and is represented by Gary Sambrook (Conservative Party) who was elected on 12 December 2019. ===Birmingham City Council=== West Heath is represented on Birmingham City Council as part of the Ward of Longbridge And West Heath by two councillors:- Debbie Clancy (Conservative) and Brett O'Reilly (Labour) who were elected on 3 May 2018 to serve a four year term. In the 2018 election Brett O'Reilly was only 14 votes ahead of the second Conservative candidate, Graham Knight, which was the narrowest victory in all the wards of the city. Prior to May 2018 West Heath, apart from a small part at the southern edge from 2004, was represented on Birmingham City Council by the three Northfield councillors. Notable previous councillors from 1973 when local government boundaries had been considerably altered include Neil Scrimshaw who died in office to be succeeded by his wife, Margaret Scrimshaw (1984-1996 and 1999-2004), Reg Corns (1973-1994, re-elected 2000-15), Les Lawrence (1982-1995 and 1998-2012), Randal Brew (2004-2018 and previously Councillor for Longbridge, Lord Mayor of Birmingham 2007-8) and Edwina Currie (1975-1986, later Member of Parliament for South Derbyshire and government minister and famously mistress of Prime Minister John Major). As part of the reorganisation of representation on Birmingham council, the Local Government Boundary Commission England released a report on 15 December 2015 which proposed that West Heath become a ward of the city with a single councillor to represent it. The suggested boundaries excluded West Heath village on Alvechurch Road from the proposed West Heath ward along with West Heath parish church, West Heath post office, West Heath Community Centre in Hampstead House, the site of the now closed West Heath library and West Heath medical centre. The village itself and the sites mentioned were all to be placed in a ward titled \\"Northfield East\\". It was proposed \\"Northfield East\\" be renamed \\"West Heath North\\" to reflect the reality that otherwise West Heath's most important sites would not be included in a ward named \\"West Heath\\". In response the Local Government Boundary Commission for England recommended on 10 May 2016 that the new wards be named \\"West Heath North\\" and \\"West Heath South\\" respectively but a final submission combined the two with part of Longbridge in a large ward with 2 councillors to be called \\"Longbridge and West Heath\\". The new ward stretches from Cofton Park in the south to West Heath Park in the north and includes West Heath village, Longbridge town centre, the Austin village, Cofton Primary School, Albert Bradbeer School, the Turves Green Schools, West Heath Primary School and St. John Fisher Roman Catholic School along with Bournville College (in Longbridge), St. Anne's Church, St. John Fisher Church and St. John The Baptist Church in Longbridge. The ward also includes Longbridge railway station, West Heath Community Centre, West Heath Hospital and notable buildings including the old railway workers cottages along Station Road, the old nailers cottage in Turves Green and The Man On The Moon public house. The ward is the most southerly in Birmingham. ==Geography== ===Geology=== West Heath is built on a well-drained stretch of gravel and sand that had been laid down under a prehistoric shallow sea and enriched by sediments from ice age glaciers. The natural heath land had grown on a flatter area between the nearby Lickey Hills and Redhill. The Lickey Hills area includes a wide geological range of rocks of various ages. The stratigraphic sequence, which is the basis for the area's diversity of landscape and habitat, comprises: *Barnt Green rocks ‚Äì Precambrian tuffs and volcanic grits *Lickey Quartzite ‚Äì a Cambrian quartzite *Keele Clay ‚Äì a Carboniferous clay *Rubery sandstone ‚Äì a fossiliferous sandstone of lower Silurian age *Clent Breccia ‚Äì a Permian breccia *Bunter Pebble Beds ‚Äì beds of Triassic water-worn pebbles The subsoil layers under West Heath and Turves Green also contains a coal seam that would indicate that a prehistoric tropical forest once existed here. ===Waterways=== The River Rea runs through West Heath on its way from its source to the North Sea. The river rises in Waseley Hills Country Park and after dropping 70 metres in the first mile passes through West Heath and onwards to Kings Norton, Selly Oak and Digbeth in the centre of Birmingham. Near Gravelly Hill Interchange, about 14 miles from its source, the Rea becomes a tributary of the River Tame and its waters eventually discharge into the North Sea via later connections with the River Trent and eventually the Humber Estuary. Although now often reduced to a sluggish trickle, due to changes in agricultural usage and other demands, the River Rea was once a major waterway and served several working mills in West Heath and provided water for the skating rink and open air lido (now both demolished). ===Roads=== The A441 Redditch Road, which runs between Birmingham and Redditch, passes to the East, and the A38 Bristol Road South, which runs between Birmingham and Worcester and eventually Cornwall, passes to the West. The M42 and M5 Motorways are also close, providing national connections. ==Demography== As part of the Northfield ward there are no separate demographic figures for West Heath. In the 2011 UK census the total population of the Northfield constituency was about 101,400 living in approximately 43000 households (in the 2001 census, approximately 25,000 people were resident in the Northfield ward, the population density being about 45 persons per hectare compared with an average of around 36.5 for Birmingham as a whole). In 2001 Northfield ward had an approximate average age of 39 compared with 36 for the city as a whole. The total population of Northfield constituency had increased by 3.5% between 2001 and 2011. In 2011, 15.1% of the population of Northfield constituency was aged 65 years and over compared with 12.9% for Birmingham as a whole. In 2011, the White ethnic group accounted for 85.8% of the population (in 2001, 94% of all residents were White). In 2011, 4.2% of the population was recorded as being Asian in origin while in 2001, 1.5% were recorded as being of Asian Pakistani origin. Around 4.4% of the population was recorded as Black in 2011 (1.5% in 2001). The 2011 Census recorded that 8.5% of the population of Northfield had been born overseas compared with figures of 22.2% for Birmingham and 13.8% for England. In 2011, 1.8% of the population of Northfield did not speak English as their first language compared with 7.5% for the whole of Birmingham In 2011, 60.7% of the population of Northfield (compared with 46.1% of the population of Birmingham) recorded that they were Christians, 28.5% recorded that they adhered to no religion (19.3% of Birmingham population), 6.8% did not state their religion (28.5%) and 2.3% described themselves as Muslims (21.8% of Birmingham population). In 2011, 67.7% of the population of Northfield were economically active compared with 64.2% of the population of Birmingham while the unemployment rate in Northfield was 6.2% compared with 9.4% for Birmingham as a whole.Birmingham City Council Challenge Unit \\"Northfield District Profile\\" November 2013 ==Economy== The early 1970s were difficult times for many of the West Heath inhabitants who worked at the motor works in Longbridge because of the severe industrial unrest which prevailed then with its accompanying \\"wildcat\\" strikes. Derek Robinson ‚Äì \\"Red Robbo\\" ‚Äì at one time lived in Alvechurch Road and he was generally seen as one of the principal leaders of the industrial action that was frequently taken against the management of the company that was then known as British Leyland. With so many local people working at the motor works at the time the factory was of great economic importance to West Heath and there was even a pub on Longbridge Lane which was called \\"The Jolly Fitter\\" which depicted a happy-looking motor worker on its pub sign. Since the closure of the Longbridge motor works there is little in the way of major industry in the area and West Heath serves as a dormitory area for central Birmingham. There is a small industrial estate in Lightning Way off Alvechurch Road including a company which manufactures glass products, a local speciality. ==Landmarks== *Man on the Moon Public House ‚Äì This public house was built in 1937 and its name was changed from The Man In The Moon to its present name after the first manned lunar landing. ==Education== * West Heath Primary School * West Heath Junior School * Cofton Junior and Infant * Albert Bradbeer Junior and Infant * St John Fisher Catholic Primary School. * Turves Green Boys' School * Turves Green Girls' School ==Religious sites== St John Fisher Church * St John Fisher Catholic Church ‚Äì The large influx of Irish people in the 1950s led to the establishment of the Catholic parish of St. John Fisher on 30 September 1956 with first masses being held by Father Philip Smith at Turves Green Girls School and afterwards at Archbishop Masterson Girl‚Äôs School. Father Philip Smith cut the first turf on the land for a new church on 5 March 1962 and Archbishop Grimshaw laid the foundation stone on 25 June 1962 with the church being opened on 31 March 1964 and consecrated on 22 June 1972, the feast of St. John Fisher. The building was designed by the architect E. Bower Norris. Until it sustained damage and was removed in 2008 there was a large sculpture of St. John Fisher dressed as Bishop of Rochester, sculpted by Jonah Jones (1919‚Äì2004), attached to the front of the church but it has now been replaced by the pattern of a cross in brick. The large Catholic population in West Heath amounts to about 900 families living in the area in 2010. * St Anne's Church ‚Äì The Anglican Parish of St. Anne covers a geographically small area with St. Anne's Church at the centre, the building consisting of the old church, called \\"The Mission Church\\" until 1942, which was built in 1900 and opened by the Bishop of Worcester on 1 December 1900 and now used as the church hall, and the new church. Work on the building of the new church began in 1968 with the consecration of St Anne‚Äôs Church and St Francis‚Äô Chapel taking place on 4 October 1974, St Francis‚Äô Day. West Heath became the Benefice of West Heath in the Deanery of Kings Norton in 1966. The architects of the new church were Harvey and Wicks. * St Nicholas Church ‚Äì Prior to the building of St. Anne's, the medieval church of St. Nicholas in Kings Norton, had served West Heath as the parish church. Cofton Common lay within the parish of St. Michael's Church at Cofton Hackett. ==Sports clubs and recreation== * West Heath Football Club, Wast Hills, Redditch Road ‚Äì founded 2008 * West Heath Snooker Club, Unit 8 Lightning Way * West Heath Community Centre, Condover Road ==Transport== ===Buses=== The suburb is served by several buses operated by National Express West Midlands, Kev‚Äôs Cars and Coaches and First Wyvern, which serve several destinations including Birmingham City Centre (45, 146), Maypole (19), West Bromwich (48), Redditch (146) & Solihull (49). ===Rail=== Northfield railway station on the Cross-City Line is located at the north end of West Heath, with trains operating to Redditch, Birmingham & Lichfield at a 10-minute frequency during peak times. Longbridge railway station is located inside the Longbridge and West Heath ward close to Longbridge town centre and the Austin Village. ==Notable people== * Mike Skinner ‚Äì the musician aka The Streets lived in and was raised in West Heath. * Freddie Farrell ‚Äì Comic. Lived in and was raised in West Heath. * Ian Lavender ‚Äì actor of Dad's Army fame (Private Frank Pike) lived in Harpers Road in West Heath. In the TV show he wore the claret and blue scarf depicting a loyalty to his real life favourite local football team Aston Villa). * Dame Barbara Cartland ‚Äì it is sometimes stated that the romantic novelist who had been born in Augustus Road, Edgbaston, lived in West Heath but no published evidence is available to support this belief. It is possible that her family moved to West Heath, less affluent than Edgbaston, temporarily after her grandfather's suicide in 1903 which followed his bankruptcy and the family's consequent loss of wealth. * Reverend Wilbert Vere Awdry ‚Äì creator of \\"Thomas The Tank Engine\\", was curate at St. Anne's West Heath from 1940 to 1946. It was during this period of his life that Awdry first told a railway story to his son Christopher in 1943 and published his first railway story, \\"The Three Railway Engines\\", in 1945. Awdry also held services at the Epiphany Church in the Austin Village. * Bruce Chatwin ‚Äì as a young child during World War II, the novelist and travel writer often lived for periods in West Heath at the home of his widowed paternal grandmother, Isobel Chatwin, who lived at 198 West Heath Road. His uncle sometimes took him to sail boats he had built at nearby Barnt Green Reservoir. Chatwin's mother Margharita had worked as an assistant to Ronald Cartland, Barbara Cartland's brother, who was Member of Parliament for Kings Norton. In the 1950s, 198 West Heath Road became the home of the local medical general practitioner, Dr. Anthony Bobak, but despite the significance of the building, the house was demolished in 2007 and replaced by a block of apartments.Shakespeare Nicholas. \\"Bruce Chatwin\\" chapter III, page 26. Vintage 2000. 1999. * The Rockin' Berries ‚Äì the chart topping band from the 1960s first formed while members were pupils at Turves Green Boys School. *David Claridge ‚Äì born in 1953, lived at 10 Coney Green Drive in the Austin Village as a young child and was a pupil at Turves Green Infants' School, before moving to a private school, Greenmore College. As an adult he created the character of \\"Roland Rat\\", a puppet which first appeared on the British breakfast television programme, TVam, in April 1983 and went on to save the station from closure. Many series were made for the BBC, Channel 5, Channel 4 and ITV. Roland continues to make guest appearances on British television from time to time, although Claridge now lives in California. ==See also== *Northfield, Birmingham *Cofton Hackett ==References== ==External links== *West Heath Library *South Birmingham Amateur Radio Society (Based in West Heath Community Centre, Hampstead House West Heath) Category:Areas of Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Northfield Constituency ","title":"West Heath, West Midlands"},{"id":"845078","text":"The Unbearable Lightness of Being () is a 1984 novel by Milan Kundera, about two women, two men, a dog and their lives in the 1968 Prague Spring period of Czechoslovak history. Although written in 1982, the novel was not published until two years later, in a French translation (as L'Insoutenable l√©g√®ret√© de l'√™tre). The original Czech text was published the following year. ==Premise== The Unbearable Lightness of Being takes place mainly in Prague in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It explores the artistic and intellectual life of Czech society from the Prague Spring of 1968 to the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union and three other Warsaw Pact countries and its aftermath. ==Characters== *Tom√°≈°: A Czech surgeon and intellectual. Tom√°≈° is a womanizer who lives for his work. He considers sex and love to be distinct entities: he has sex with many women but loves only his wife, Tereza. He sees no contradiction between these two positions. He explains womanizing as an imperative to explore female idiosyncrasies only expressed during sex. At first he views his wife as a burden whom he is obliged to take care of. After the Warsaw Pact invasion, they escape to Zurich, where he starts womanizing again. Tereza, homesick, returns to Prague with the dog. He quickly realizes he wants to be with her and follows her home. He has to deal with the consequences of a letter to the editor in which he metaphorically likened the Czech Communists to Oedipus. Eventually fed up with life in Prague under the Communist regime, Tom√°≈° and Tereza move to the countryside. He abandons his twin obsessions of work and womanizing and discovers true happiness with Tereza. His epitaph, written by his Catholic son, is \\"He Wanted the Kingdom of God on Earth\\". *Tereza: Tom√°≈°'s young wife. A gentle, intellectual photographer, she delves into dangerous and dissident photojournalism during the Soviet occupation of Prague. Tereza does not condemn Tom√°≈° for his infidelities, instead characterizing herself as a weaker person. Tereza is mostly defined by her view of the body as disgusting and shameful, due to her mother's embrace of the body's grotesque functions. Throughout the book she fears simply being another body in Tom√°≈°'s array of women. Once Tom√°≈° and Tereza move to the countryside, she devotes herself to raising cattle and reading. During this time she learns about her anima through an adoration of pet animals, reaching the conclusion that they were the last link to the paradise abandoned by Adam and Eve and becomes alienated from other people. *Sabina: Tom√°≈°'s mistress and closest friend. Sabina lives her life as an extreme example of lightness, taking profound satisfaction in the act of betrayal. She declares war on kitsch and struggles against the constraints imposed upon her by her puritan ancestry and the Communist Party. This struggle is shown through her paintings. She occasionally expresses excitement at humiliation, as shown through the use of her grandfather's bowler hat, a symbol that is born during one sexual encounter with Tom√°≈°, before it eventually changes meaning and becomes a relic of the past. Later in the novel, she begins to correspond with ≈†imon while living under the roof of some older Americans who admire her artistic skill. *Franz: Sabina's lover and a Geneva professor and idealist. Franz falls in love with Sabina, whom he considers a liberal and romantically tragic Czech dissident. He is a kind and compassionate man. As one of the novel's dreamers, Franz bases his actions on loyalty to the memories of his mother and Sabina. His life revolves completely around books and academia, eventually to the extent that he seeks lightness and ecstasy by participating in marches and protests, the last of which is a march in Thailand to the border with Cambodia. In Bangkok after the march, he is mortally wounded during a mugging. *Karenin: The dog of Tom√°≈° and Tereza. Although she is a female dog, the name is masculine and is a reference to Alexei Karenin, the husband in Anna Karenina. Karenin displays extreme dislike of change. Once moved to the countryside, Karenin becomes more content as she is able to enjoy more attention from her companions. She also quickly befriends a pig named Mefisto. During this time Tom√°≈° discovers that Karenin has cancer and even after removing a tumor it is clear that Karenin is going to die. On her deathbed she unites Tereza and Tom√°≈° through her \\"smile\\" at their attempts to improve her health. *≈†imon: Tom√°≈°'s estranged son from an earlier marriage. ==Philosophical underpinnings== Challenging Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of eternal recurrence (the idea that the universe and its events have already occurred and will recur ad infinitum), the story's thematic meditations posit the alternative: that each person has only one life to live and that which occurs in life occurs only once and never again ‚Äì thus the \\"lightness\\" of being. Moreover, this lightness also signifies freedom; Tom√°≈° and Sabina display this lightness, whereas Tereza's character is \\"weighed down\\". In the Constance Garnett translation of Tolstoy's \\"War and Peace\\" she gives us the phrase \\"strange lightness of being\\" during the description of Prince Andrey's death. In contrast, the concept of eternal recurrence imposes a \\"heaviness\\" on life and the decisions that are made ‚Äì to borrow from Nietzsche's metaphor, it gives them \\"weight\\". Nietzsche believed this heaviness could be either a tremendous burden or great benefit depending on the individual's perspective.John Hansen (2015) \\"The Ambiguity and Existentialism of Human Sexuality in The Unbearable Lightness of Being.\\" Philosophy Pathways Issue 194 The \\"unbearable lightness\\" in the title also refers to the lightness of love and sex, which are themes of the novel. Kundera portrays love as fleeting, haphazard and possibly based upon endless strings of coincidences, despite holding much significance for humans. Quoting Kundera from the book: > ‚ÄúThe heavier the burden, the closer our lives come to the earth, the more > real and truthful they become. Conversely, the absolute absence of burden > causes man to be lighter than air, to soar into heights, take leave of the > earth and his earthly being, and become only half real, his movements as > free as they are insignificant. What then shall we choose? Weight or > lightness? ...When we want to give expression to a dramatic situation in our > lives, we tend to use metaphors of heaviness. We say that something has > become a great burden to us. We either bear the burden or fail and go down > with it, we struggle with it, win or lose. And Sabina ‚Äì what had come over > her? Nothing. She had left a man because she felt like leaving him. Had he > persecuted her? Had he tried to take revenge on her? No. Her drama was a > drama not of heaviness but of lightness. What fell to her lot was not the > burden, but the unbearable lightness of being.‚ÄùThe Unbearable Lightness Of > Being\\" By Milan Kundera, pages 3 and 64 In the novel, Nietzsche's concept is attached to an interpretation of the German adage einmal ist keinmal 'one occurrence is not significant'; namely, an \\"all-or-nothing\\" cognitive distortion that Tom√°≈° must overcome in his hero's journey. He initially believes \\"If we only have one life to live, we might as well not have lived at all,\\" and specifically (with respect to committing to Tereza) \\"There is no means of testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison.\\" The novel resolves this question decisively that such a commitment is in fact possible and desirable.Dennis Wrong (2005) The Persistence of the Particular, chapter 1: The irreducible particularities of human experience, Transaction Publishers ==Publication== The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1984) was not published in the original Czech until 1985 by the exile publishing house 68 Publishers (Toronto, Ontario). The second Czech edition was published in October 2006, in Brno, Czech Republic, some 18 years after the Velvet Revolution, because Kundera did not approve it earlier. The first English translation by Michael Henry Heim was published in hardback in 1984 by Harper & Row in the U.S. and Faber and Faber in the UK and in paperback in 1985. ==Film== In 1988, an American-made film adaptation of the novel was released starring Daniel Day-Lewis, Lena Olin and Juliette Binoche. In a note to the Czech edition of the book, Kundera remarks that the movie had very little to do with the spirit either of the novel or the characters in it.\\"Nesnesiteln√°lehkost byt√≠\\", \\"Pozn√°mka Autora\\", p. 341, dated 2006 France, published by Atlantis. In the same note, Kundera goes on to say that after this experience he no longer allows any adaptations of his work. ==See also== *Existentialism ==References== ==External links== *SparkNotes *An essay written by Giuseppe Raudino Category:1984 French novels Category:20th-century Czech novels Category:Adultery in novels Category:Books about Soviet military occupations Category:Harper & Row books Category:French novels adapted into films Category:Czech novels adapted into films Category:Novels by Milan Kundera Category:Novels set in Prague Category:Philosophical novels Category:Existentialist novels Category:Prague Spring Category:Faber and Faber books Category:√âditions Gallimard books ","title":"The Unbearable Lightness of Being"},{"id":"845081","text":"Texas historical marker for the Texas School Book Depository The Texas School Book Depository, now known as the Dallas County Administration Building, is a seven-floor building facing Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas. The building was Lee Harvey Oswald's vantage point in his assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Oswald, an employee at the depository, shot and killed President Kennedy from a sixth floor window on the building's southeastern corner; 30 minutes after the shooting, Kennedy died at Parkland Memorial Hospital. The structure is a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark, located at 411 Elm Street on the northwest corner of Elm and North Houston Streets, at the western end of downtown Dallas. ==Early history== The site of the building was originally owned by John Neely Bryan. During the 1880s, Maxime Guillot operated a wagon shop on the property. In 1894, the Rock Island Plow Company bought the land, and four years later constructed a five- story building for its Texas division, the Southern Rock Island Plow Company. In 1901, the building was hit by lightning and nearly burned to the ground. It was rebuilt in 1902 in the Commercial Romanesque Revival style and expanded to seven stories. In 1937, the Carraway Byrd Corporation purchased the property, but they defaulted on the loan. It was sold at public auction July 4, 1939 and purchased by D. Harold Byrd.Jerry Organ (2000). \\"Murder Perch to Museum\\". Marquette University. Under Byrd's ownership, the building remained empty until 1940, when it was leased by grocery wholesaler John Sexton & Co. Sexton Foods used this location as the branch office for sales, manufacturing, and distribution for the south and southwest United States. In November 1961, Sexton Foods moved to a modern distribution facility located at 650 Regal Row Dallas; by then, the building was known locally as the Sexton Building. The building was refurbished, and partitions, carpeting, air conditioning, and a new passenger elevator were added on the first four floors. ==Assassination of John F. Kennedy== In 1963, the building was in use as a multi-floor warehouse storing school textbooks and other related materials and an order-fulfillment center by the privately owned Texas School Book Depository Company. The company found that the upper floors had sustained oil damage from items stored there by the previous tenant, so they began to cover the floors with plywood to protect their books (stored in cardboard boxes) from the oil. Work had begun on the west side of the sixth floor just before President Kennedy's motorcade, \\"leaving the whole scene in disarray, with stock shifted as far as the east wall, and stacks in between piled unusually high.\\" Lee Harvey Oswald was working as a temporary employee at the building, and fired three shots from a sixth floor window at the presidential motorcade on November 22, 1963. ===Second building=== The Texas School Book Depository Company maintained a second warehouse at 1917 Houston, several blocks north of the main building. The short four-story structure was well removed from the parade route, half- hidden on an unpaved section of Houston. Oswald's supervisor Roy Truly told the Warren Commission that he had the option to assign Oswald to either building on his first day at work. \\"Oswald and another fellow reported for work on the same day [October 15] and I needed one of them for the depository building. I picked Oswald.\\" This second building was eventually destroyed to make way for the Woodall Rodgers Freeway. ==Later years== During his two terms as mayor of Dallas, Wes Wise guided Dallas out from under the cloud of the assassination and at the same time saved the Texas School Book Depository from imminent destruction, preserving it for further research into the president's murder.Douglass, James W. JFK and the Unspeakable. Why he died and why it matters. Maryknoll, NY, Orbis Books, 2008, p. 295-298. The Texas School Book Depository Company moved out in 1970 and the building was sold at auction to Aubrey Mayhew, a Nashville, Tennessee music producer and collector of Kennedy memorabilia, by the owner D. H. Bard. In 1972, ownership reverted to Bard, and the building was purchased in 1977 by the government of Dallas County. After renovating the lower five floors of the building for use as county government offices, the Dallas County Administration Building was dedicated on March 29, 1981. On President's Day 1989, the sixth floor opened to the public (for an admission charge) as the Sixth Floor Museum of assassination-related exhibits. On President's Day 2002, the seventh-floor gallery opened. The gallery opened on February 18, 2002 with the exhibit: \\"The Pulitzer Prize Photographs: Capture the Moment\\". A $2.5 million renovation turned the storage area on the seventh floor into a new gallery space for the museum. Other exhibits that have hung in the space include works of Andy Warhol. On May 4, 2010, burglars attempted to steal a safe from the Sixth Floor Museum, but fled when \\"they were confronted by a security guard,\\" leaving the unopened safe suspended from a winch on the back of a truck. ==See also== *List of National Historic Landmarks in Texas *National Register of Historic Places listings in Dallas County, Texas *Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks in Dallas County *List of Dallas Landmarks ==References== ==External links== * Dealey Plaza live cam * Official property ownership record from the Dallas Central Appraisal District * Category:History of Dallas Category:Buildings and structures in Dallas Category:Buildings and structures associated with the assassination of John F.

The Fremont Bridge at the opening of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, July 4, 1917 The Fremont Bridge is a double-leaf bascule bridge that spans the Fremont Cut in Seattle, Washington. The bridge, which connects Fremont Avenue North and 4th Avenue North, connects the neighborhoods of Fremont and Queen Anne. The Fremont Bridge was opened on Friday June 15, 1917, at a cost of $410,000. The first traffic over the bridge was to \\"owl cars\\", the last run of the trolleys, and then after 5am the same day to all other traffic. The Lake Washington Ship Canal was dedicated on July 4, 1917, which has caused confusion about the opening date, for this bridge crosses the canal. The Fremont Bridge is the first of four city bascules to cross the canal, the others being Ballard Bridge (1917), University Bridge (1919), and Montlake Bridge (1925). The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, and is also a designated city landmark, ID #110347. In its early years, before the construction of the nearby Aurora Bridge in 1932, the Fremont Bridge had the most vehicle traffic of any bascule bridge in the United States. In another respect, it remains among the busiest even today: due to its low vessel clearance of , the Fremont Bridge opens an average of 35 times a day, which makes it the most frequently opened drawbridge in the United States and one of the busiest bascule bridges in the world. Federal law gives marine traffic the right-of-way over vehicular traffic; however, the Fremont Bridge is closed to most water traffic during rush hours. The Fremont Bridge was originally painted a dull green. In 1972, the Fremont Improvement Committee picked a new color, Fremont Orange, and residents approved the change. The bridge's blue and orange color was chosen by voters at a 1985 street fair. In 2006, the Fremont Bridge underwent a $41.9 million restoration project to replace the approaches and maintenance shop, as well as renovation of the mechanical and electrical systems that operate the bascule. The approaches were completed in May 2007 and testing lasted through the Spring of 2008. In 2014 the city began repainting the bridge. The bridge received a permanent art installation in February 2018 as part of an artist residency program coinciding with the centennial of the bridge and two of the ship canal's other bascule bridges. The Fremont Bridge was outfitted with what is to be the first of three dynamic lighting designs. The Ballard Bridge and University Bridge will also receive installations assuming funding can be secured. ==Earlier bridges== The present bridge is actually the third bridge at this location. A low trestle bridge was built in 1890 or 1891. In 1911, in anticipation of the construction of the Ship Canal, it was replaced by a higher trestle bridge. While that bridge was always intended as temporary, it proved even more so than planned, because early in the afternoon of March 12, 1914 the Fremont dam, which controlled the level of Lake Union, gave way. Over the course of a day, the lake level lowered by nine feet, stranding vessels and floating homes, and rupturing the central portion of the second Fremont bridge. A separate longer streetcar trestle from Westlake Avenue to Stone Way held, and streetcar traffic that had used the Fremont bridge was rerouted over that trestle until the completion of the present-day bridge. ==References== ==External links== * William C.

In addition to the vehicular traffic, the bridge conveys pedestrians and bicyclists across the canal by way of sidewalks on each side of the roadway. The bridge does not open during morning and evening rush hours.

Dealey was the long-time publisher of The Dallas Morning News and owner of the A. H. Belo Corporation. Dealey Plaza in Dallas is named in his honor, and became instantly world- famous on Friday, November 22, 1963, when it became the site of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. George Dealey's press pass for the Texas Centennial Exposition in 1936 ==Childhood== Dealey was born on September 18, 1859, at the home of his parents, George Dealey (1829‚Äì1894) and Mary Ann Nellins (1829‚Äì1913), on Queen St., Rusholme, Manchester, England. He was the fifth of 10 children. In the mid-1860s the family moved to Liverpool, England, where he began his schooling and worked as a grocer's apprentice. In 1870 his family immigrated to Galveston, Texas, where he continued in public school and worked at various odd jobs. ==Newspaper career== On October 12, 1874, he assumed an older brother's job as office boy at The Galveston News at $3.00 per week, for the owner, Alfred H. Belo. Dealey took evening classes at the Island City Business College and rose steadily at the News. As traveling correspondent, he sent both news stories and newspaper-business reports back to Galveston. In 1884, he determined that Dallas would be the best market for a new Belo company newspaper. In 1885, The Dallas Morning News debuted. He became the paper's manager in 1895, a board member in 1902, vice president and general manager of the corporation in 1906, and president in 1919. Dealey refused advertising that he considered dishonest or immoral, including ads for hard liquor. He refused ads for oilfield ventures, since he could not determine which were sound businesses. The News also opposed the Ku Klux Klan's influence in the 1920s. Dealey also owned the G. B. Dealey Land Co. and the West Commerce Realty Co. He founded an early newspaper-owned radio station, WFAA, in 1922. In 1926, Dealey bought The Dallas Morning News, the Journal (an evening edition), the Semi-Weekly Farm News, and the Texas Almanac from the heirs of A. H. Belo, along with a majority of the company stock. ==Civic activities== Under Dealey, the News was enlisted in the cause of civic planning. A campaign of 1899 led to the foundation of the Cleaner Dallas League, which became the Dallas Civic Improvement League in 1902. He was instrumental in the adoption of the 1910 Kessler Plan to improve Dallas and provide for its growth. He helped establish Southern Methodist University and was instrumental in bringing a Federal Reserve branch to Dallas. Dealey served on the board of governors of the American City Planning Institute (1920‚Äì21), as vice president of the National Municipal League (1923‚Äì24), on the advisory council of the American Planning and Civic Association, and on the national committee of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation. He was a director of the Children's Hospital of Texas and was president of the Family Bureau, a Dallas social agency, from its inception in 1908. He was also president of the Philosophical Society of Texas, a member of the Texas Press Association, an honorary life member of the Texas State Historical Association, founder (1922) and lifetime president (from 1933) of the Dallas Historical Society, and second vice president of the Associated Press (1923‚Äì24). He had honorary roles with Sigma Delta Chi (1940‚Äì41) and Phi Beta Kappa (1943). He received honorary doctoral degrees from Southern Methodist University (1921), Austin College (1924), and the University of Missouri (1925), the last of which invited him to accept a gift to its school of journalism from the British Empire Press Union. Dealey Plaza in Downtown Dallas was named for him upon commencement of its construction in 1934 (for the 1936 Texas Centennial). He initially thought to decline the honor, but was persuaded to accept it by his son. A of G.B. Dealey was made and erected in Dealey Plaza in 1949. ==Personal life== He married Olivia Allen at her home in Lexington, Missouri, on April 9, 1884. She was born in Lexington on November 14, 1863, and died at her home in Dallas on January 28, 1960. She had succeeded her husband as chairman of the board of A. H. Belo Corporation and was serving in that capacity when she died. The Dealeys had three daughters and two sons. The sons were Walter Allen Dealey and Edward Musgrove (Ted) Dealey. Ted Dealey succeeded his father as publisher of the Morning News. A younger brother, James Q. Dealey (1861‚Äì1937), was a professor of political science at Brown University and later editor of the Morning News. A nephew, Samuel David Dealey (1906‚Äì1944), was a World War II naval submarine officer who received the Medal of Honor and for whom the USS Dealey (DE-1006) was named. James M. Moroney III, publisher of the Morning News from 2001‚Äì2018 and current chief executive of the A.H. Belo Corporation, is Dealey's great-grandson. Another grandson, Dr. Walter Allen (Al) Dealey Jr. became a Christian minister and studied under Norman Vincent Peale. Dealey was a Thirty-third-degree Scottish Rite Mason, Knight Templar, Shriner, and member of the Red Cross of Constantine. He was a Presbyterian and Democrat. The New York Times called him the \\"dean of American newspaper publishers.\\" He was still working as a publisher when he died of a massive coronary occlusion at his Dallas home, February 26, 1946, at the age of 86. He was buried in Grove Hill Cemetery in Dallas. ==Legacy== * The New York Times called him the Dean of American Publishers. * The Dallas Independent School District (DISD) operates George Bannerman Dealey Montessori School, a PK-8 school named for him and located in the Preston Royal area of north Dallas. ==References== ==Further reading== * Acheson, Sam. 35,000 Days in Texas: A History of the Dallas News and Its Forbears.

They are not closely related to and should not be confused with the freshwater hatchetfishes, which are teleosts in the characiform family Gasteropelecidae. The Sternoptychidae have 10 genera and about 70 species altogether.Nelson (2006): p.209 The scientific name means \\"Sternoptyx-family\\", from Sternoptyx (the type genus) + the standard animal family suffix \\"-idae\\". It ultimately derives from Ancient Greek st√©rnon (œÉœÑŒ≠œÅŒΩŒøŒΩ, \\"breast\\") + pt√Ωx (œÄœÑœçŒæ, \\"a fold/crease\\") + Latin forma (\\"external form\\"), the Greek part in reference to the thorax shape of marine hatchetfishes.Woodhouse (1910), Glare (1968-1982), FishBase (2006) ==Description and ecology== Found most often at depths of 200‚Äì600 meters in tropical, subtropical and temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, marine hatchetfishes range in size from Polyipnus danae at to the c.-long Giant Hatchetfish (Argyropelecus gigas).Fink (1998) The members of the disputed subfamily Maurolicinae have a more conventional fish shape. The mouth is located at the tip of the snout and directed downwards, more so in the Sternoptychinae. Unlike other Stomiiformes, they still have fully developed pseudobranchs. Their branchiostegal rays are 6-10, three of them attach to the posterior ceratohyal (epihyal). Their bodies are covered in delicate silvery scales which abrade easily. In some species, such as the Highlight Hatchetfish (Sternoptyx pseudobscura), large sections of the body at the base of the anal fin and/or caudal fin are transparent. The anal fin has 11-38 rays and may be divided in two parts. An adipose fin is usually present. The Sternoptychinae have preopercular spines and blade-like pterygiophores in front of the dorsal fin. Their large, sometimes tube-shaped eyes can collect the faintest of light and focus well on objects both close and far. In many genera, the eyes are fixed gazing permanently upwards, enabling them to discern the silhouettes of prey moving overhead against the slightly brighter upper waters.Fink (1998), Nelson (2006): p.209 Sternoptychidae undertake nightly mass migrations from depths of 3,600 metres to the upper 50‚Äì100 metres of the starlit water column. There they feed throughout the night, returning to the depths by daybreak. Their prey consists primarily of tiny crustaceans, such as amphipods, copepods, euphausiids (krill) and ostracods (seed shrimp), and of fish smaller than themselves. What little is known of their life cycle suggests that at least some members of this family are short-lived, dying after no more than a year. They spawn in the open water, and do not guard or otherwise care for their offspring; species with a short lifespan are presumably semelparous The fry - even of Sternoptychinae - look like tiny pearlsides (Maurolicus).Fink (1998), FishBase (2006) ===Bioluminescence=== Marine hatchetfishes are not the only animals that seek out prey by watching for silhouettes from below. Indeed, many fishes that consider Sternoptychidae prey do so, and to foil their predaceous attempts, the Sternoptychidae have evolved an astounding ability: bioluminescent counter-illumination. Counterillumination (or counter- lighting) involves the production of light by the fish for the purpose of camouflaging its silhouette from observers lurking below. Sternoptychidae produce this light with organs called photophores, of which they have between 3 and 7 - usually 6 - on the branchiostegal membrane along the lower edge of the chest and belly. The intensity of the light produced is controlled by the fish, an appropriate brightness chosen according to how much light reaches the eyes from above. The patterns of light created by the photophores are also unique to each species, probably playing a role in courtship.Fink (1998), Nelson (2006): p.209 ==Systematics== The Sternoptychidae belong to the order Stomiiformes, which is often placed in the teleost superorder Stenopterygii, usually together with the Ateleopodiformes (jellynoses), but sometimes on their own. But it may well be that the closest living relatives of the \\"Stenopterygii\\" are found among the superorder Protacanthopterygii, and that the former would need to be merged in the latter. In some classifications, the \\"Stenopterygii\\" are kept separate but included with the Protacanthopterygii and the monotypic superorder Cyclosquamata in an unranked clade called Euteleostei. That would probably require splitting two additional monotypic superorders out of the Protacanthopterygii, and thus result in a profusion of very small taxa.Nelson (2006): pp.207-208, Diogo (2008) The Stomiiformes have also been considered close relatives of the Aulopiformes. The latter are otherwise placed in a monotypic superorder \\"Cyclosquamata\\" but also appear to be quite close to the Protacanthopterygii indeed. The relationships of these - and the Lampriformes or Myctophiformes, which are also usually treated as monotypic superorders - to the taxa mentioned before is still not well resolved at all, and regardless whether one calls them Protacanthopterygii sensu lato or Euteleostei, the phylogeny of this group of moderately advanced Teleostei is in need of further study.FishBase (2005), Diogo (2008) The ancestral Stomiiformes probably resembled the Gonostomatidae, with thin brownish bodies, rows of egg-shaped photophores adorning the lower body parts, and mouths with numerous teeth. The family Gonostomatidae is the closest living relative of the Sternoptychidae, and these two form the suborder Gonostomatoidei. Indeed, some Sternoptychidae are called \\"bristlemouths\\", like the bulk of the Gonostomatidae. Compared to their relatives, the marine hatchetfishes are a more apomorphic group, but they have evolved in an entirely different direction from the other \\"advanced\\" lineage of Stomiiformes, the huge family Stomiidae.Nelson (2006): pp.208-209 ===Classification=== Typically, the Sternoptychidae are divided into two subfamilies, with the more plesiomorphic members making up the Maurolicinae. Symplesiomorphies are no reliable indicator of actual relationships, however. While it remains to be seen what Sternoptychidae other than the pearlsides (Maurolicus, the type genus) do actually belong in the Maurolicinae, it is unlikely that the two-subfamily arrangement is correct. It may even be that the Maurolicinae are just an indiscriminate assemblage of unrelated basal Sternoptychidae and are altogether invalid. The Sternoptychinae - the \\"true\\" marine hatchetfishes - on the other hand are monophyletic. Mueller's Pearlside, Maurolicus muelleri (Maurolicinae) Spiny Hatchetfish, Polyipnus spinosus (Sternoptychinae) The provisional arrangement of families and genera of Sternoptychidae is as follows: * Subfamily Maurolicinae ** Genus Araiophos (2 species) ** Genus Argyripnus - bristle-mouth fishes (6 species) ** Genus Danaphos - bottlelights (1-2 species) ** Genus Maurolicus - pearlsides (15 species) ** Genus Sonoda (2 species) ** Genus Thorophos (2 species) ** Genus Valenciennellus - constellationfishes (2 species) * Subfamily Sternoptychinae - marine hatchetfishes, deep-sea hatchetfishes ** Genus Argyropelecus - silver hatchetfishes (7 species) ** Genus Polyipnus (32 species) ** Genus Sternoptyx (4 species) == Footnotes == == References == * (2008): On the cephalic and pectoral girdle muscles of the deep sea fish Alepocephalus rostratus, with comments on the functional morphology and phylogenetic relationships of the Alepocephaloidei (Teleostei).

Tony Delk was picked 16th overall in the 1996 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets. He was traded by the Hornets along with Muggsy Bogues to the Golden State Warriors for B. J. Armstrong on November 7, 1997, where he played for two seasons before signing with the Sacramento Kings on August 16, 1999. He appeared in 46 games in 1999-00, subsequently joining the Phoenix Suns on August 1, 2000. In a January 2, 2001, overtime game against the Kings, he scored a career-high 53 points on 20-for-27 field goal shooting. This was the only game of Delk's career in which he scored 30 or more points. Delk was eventually dealt with Rodney Rogers to the Celtics, for Joe Johnson, Milt Palacio, and Randy Brown. On October 20, 2003, Delk was traded to the Dallas Mavericks, along with Antoine Walker for Chris Mills, Ji≈ô√≠ Welsch, Raef LaFrentz, and a 2004 first-round pick. After a year with the Mavericks, Delk and Walker were again traded, in a deal for Jason Terry and Alan Henderson. Delk lasted one and a half seasons with the Hawks before being waived on February 25, 2006, signing with the Detroit Pistons on March 1, where he backed up point guard Chauncey Billups. Delk finished his NBA career with averages of 9.1 PPG, 2.5 RPG and 1.9 APG as he, in August 2006, signed a contract with the Greek basketball team, Panathinaikos, in Athens. He won the Greek Cup, the Greek Championship and the European Championship with Panathinaikos, but was released in May 2007, citing compatibility issues. He announced his retirement from professional basketball in November 2007. In 2008, nonetheless, he played three games for the Gigantes de Carolina in the BSN, the professional basketball league of Puerto Rico. He retired, once again, and served as a technical assistant with the same team. ==Coaching career== On April 16, 2009 it was announced that Delk would be returning to his alma mater along with his former college teammate Scott Padgett to serve on coach John Calipari's staff at the University of Kentucky.Calipari to hire former Wildcats Delk, Padgett In July 2011, the New Mexico State Aggies basketball team hired him as an assistant coach to Marvin Menzies.

They are more common in parliamentary systems, than in other democratic systems where cabinet heads must be confirmed by a separate legislative body, and occur at pleasure in autocratic systems without suitable checks-and-balances. ==In parliamentary systems== Cabinet reshuffles happen in parliamentary systems for a variety of reasons. Periodically, smaller reshuffles are needed to replace ministers who have resigned, retired or died. Reshuffles are also a way for a premier to \\"refresh\\" the government, often in the face of poor polling numbers; remove poor performers; and reward supporters and punish others. It is common after elections, even if the party in power is retained, as the prime minister's reading of public opinion as evidenced by the election may require some change in policy, in addition to any changes resulting from the retirement or defeat of individual ministers at the election. Similarly, when a new prime minister enters office from the same party as the previous one, he or she might appoint a very different ministry than that of his or her predecessor to reflect a change in policies and priorities; an example is Gordon Brown's government, formed in 2007 after the departure of Tony Blair. A reshuffle also provides an opportunity to create, abolish and rename departments (and ministerial posts) and to reassign responsibilities among departments. This may be done to reflect new priorities or for reasons of efficiency. ==In other systems== Cabinet reshuffles are far less common in systems where members of the Cabinet are not drawn from the legislative branch. In such systems there is a far larger pool of viable candidates to choose a cabinet from. Members of such cabinets are usually chosen on account of their qualifications to run a specific portfolio, so moving these cabinet members to different portfolios at a later time usually makes little sense. For instance, in the United States, it would be very unusual for a president to reassign multiple cabinet secretaries to new positions, especially since a United States Cabinet member moved to a new position within the cabinet needs to be confirmed in the new role by the United States Senate‚Äîthis alone is seen as a powerful deterrent against U.S. presidents initiating major cabinet reshuffles. On an individual basis, however, U.S. Cabinet members will occasionally change departments‚Äîfor example, Norman Mineta served as Secretary of Commerce under Bill Clinton before becoming Secretary of Transportation for Clinton's successor, George W. Bush. Cabinet reshuffles occur at the pleasure of monarchs or dictators in autocratic systems, which lack the checks-and-balances of systems with greater citizen or legislative control. ==See also== * 2006 United Kingdom Cabinet reshuffle * List of people who have held multiple United States Cabinet-level positions * Musical chairs * Night of the Long Knives (1962) ==References== == External links == * ","title":"Cabinet reshuffle"},{"id":"845116","text":"Eric Sidney Watkins (6 September 1928 ‚Äì 12 September 2012), commonly known within the Formula One fraternity as Professor Sid or simply Prof, was an English neurosurgeon. Born in Liverpool, Watkins enrolled at the University of Liverpool where he graduated in 1952. He later served four years in the Royal Army Medical Corps before specialising in neurosurgery in Oxford and later, in London. Watkins also acted as a race track doctor at weekends which he continued at Watkins Glen International when he was appointed a Professor of Neurosurgery at State University of New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse. At a meeting with Brabham team boss Bernie Ecclestone, he was offered the role as the FIA Formula One Safety and Medical Delegate, head of the Formula One on-track medical team, and first responder in case of a crash, a role which Watkins performed for 26 years. He helped to save the lives of many drivers including Gerhard Berger, Martin Donnelly, √ârik Comas, Rubens Barrichello, Karl Wendlinger and Mika H√§kkinen. Watkins was married, with four sons and two daughters. He died on 12 September 2012 of a heart attack. ==Early life== Sidney Watkins was born in Liverpool to Wallace and Jessica Watkins. Wallace was originally a coal miner from Gloucestershire, but had moved to Liverpool during the Great Depression of the 1930s where he started a small business initially repairing bicycles before progressing to motor vehicle repairs. Watkins worked for his father at the garage until he was 25. He had two brothers and a sister. Watkins gained a scholarship at Prescot Grammar School. He told his father that he wanted to become a doctor, an idea of which his father disapproved. Watkins graduated as a Doctor of Medicine from the University of Liverpool in 1956; during his time there he carried out research on the effects of heat stress on performance, finding that increased heat greatly affected intellectual performance. This research would later prove useful as part of his work in motor racing. Following graduation, he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps in West Africa for four years. There he competed in his only motorsport event, driving a Ford Zephyr Zodiac in the 1955 West African Rally, retiring from the event after the first stage.The Flying Doctor He returned to the UK in 1958 to specialise in neurosurgery at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, and it was in 1961 when he took up his first motorsport event in a medical capacity at a kart race at the Brands Hatch circuit. During his free time he acted as race doctor at the Silverstone Circuit. Upon receiving an offer to be a professor of neurosurgery at the State University of New York in 1962, Watkins moved to Syracuse, New York, and continued his interest in motorsport at the Watkins Glen circuit. Watkins took four members to the circuit and his own medical equipment due to the lack of supplies provided by circuit officials. He returned to England in 1970 to act as head of neurosurgery at the London Hospital, and was invited to join the RAC medical panel the same year. ==Formula One== ===1970s=== In 1978 he met Bernie Ecclestone, at the time chief executive of the Formula One Constructors Association, who offered Watkins the position of official Formula One race doctor. Ecclestone had checked in for a medical problem and offered Watkins $35,000 a year for the entire season. Watkins had to pay airfares, hotel bills, rental cars and all incidental expenses. Watkins accepted, and attended his first race at the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix. Outside of the Grand Prix weekends, he remained in his position as a neurosurgeon in London. His first day as the Safety and Medical Delegate, was at Brands Hatch to introduce himself to the drivers.F1 Racing October 2010 p. 89 Watkins did not attend private test day sessions due to the large number of sessions held over the course of the year. Initially, his appointment was met with hostility by some of the racing circuits, who saw his appointment as a way of monitoring their performance. At the time, medical facilities would sometimes consist of nothing more than a tent. At the 1978 Italian Grand Prix, Ronnie Peterson crashed heavily on the first lap, with the car catching fire. Fellow drivers Clay Regazzoni, Patrick Depailler and James Hunt pulled him from the wreckage but by the time Watkins arrived at the scene, Italian police had formed a human wall to prevent people from entering the area. Watkins was initially stopped from assisting with the treatment and there was a long delay of approximately 18 minutes before an ambulance arrived to take Peterson to hospital, where he died the following day. Following the race, Watkins demanded that Ecclestone provide better safety equipment, an anaesthetist, a medical car and a medical helicopter (Medevac). All were provided at the next race in the United States. In addition, it was decided that the medical car containing Watkins would follow the racing cars for the first lap of the race to provide immediate help in the event of a first lap incident. The organisers at Hockenheim had denied Watkins access to race control and Ecclestone threatened to stand in front of the grid and order the drivers out of their cars. ===1980s=== 1981 saw FISA, motorsport's governing body at the time, appoint a Medical Commission, with Watkins elected President. In 1982, at the Belgian Grand Prix, Watkins went with the medical car driven by Roland Bruynseraede as it headed to the scene of Gilles Villeneuve's serious accident and placed a tube into his windpipe for ventilation with his heart in normal condition. Villeneuve was airlifted by helicopter to the Gasthuisberg Hospital in Leuven and Watkins spoke to Villeneuve's wife Joann who was in her home in Monaco when 1979 champion Jody Scheckter informed her of the news. Joann flew to Belgium along with Scheckter's wife Pam to speak with Watkins. Joann and Watkins both accepted the decision to turn off his respirator, and Villeneuve died. At the Canadian Grand Prix later that year, Watkins had to deal with the fatal accident of Riccardo Paletti on the first lap of the race. Watkins got to Paletti's car 16 seconds after impact and opened the visor of the helmet to see his blown pupils. Then, before any medical attention could be received, Paletti's car caught fire due to the petrol tank having ruptured and ignited. Watkins had suitable clothing to prevent him from suffering serious burns but his hands were affected. After he extinguished the fire, he took off his gloves to put an airway into Paletti's throat but Watkins' boots had melted in the fire.F1 Racing October 2010 p. 90 At the British Grand Prix in 1985, Watkins received a silver trophy during the drivers briefing. The trophy reads; \\"To the Prof, our thanks for your invaluable contribution to Formula 1. Nice to know you're there\\".F1 Racing October 2010 p. 92 In 1986, Watkins had the responsibility for caring for Frank Williams who sustained spinal cord injuries in a car crash on a public road. In 1987, Nelson Piquet crashed during practice at the San Marino Grand Prix, and was declared unfit to race by Watkins. Despite it being only the second race of the season, Piquet tried to persuade officials to allow him to compete knowing any lost points could lose him the championship (which he ultimately won). In response, Watkins threatened to resign if overruled. The officials opted to support Watkins, and Piquet sat out the race, later admitting that it was the correct decision. ===1990s=== Watkins founded the Brain and Spine Foundation in 1992, a charity that aims to improve \\"the prevention, treatment and care of people affected by disorders of the brain and spine\\". He was a Patron of the foundation. At the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, Watkins had to attend to his close personal friend, three-time champion Ayrton Senna, following the accident which claimed his life. Watkins had concerns about Senna's mental state following two crashes earlier in the weekend that had injured Senna's countryman and protege Rubens Barrichello and killed Austrian Roland Ratzenberger, suggesting to him that the two leave the track, go fishing, and forget about the race. Early in the race, Senna hit a retaining wall at nearly 140 miles per hour and Watkins was the first to attend to the driver. He reported that based on what he ascertained on arriving at the scene, that there was no chance Senna could have been saved, due to the graveness of the head injury he had suffered. Watkins also said he noticed Senna sighed, and his whole body relaxed, and that, though he was not religious, he felt it was at that moment Senna's \\"spirit left his body\\". The FIA Expert Advisory Safety Committee was set up in 1994 following the race and Watkins was appointed as its chairman. Watkins was also responsible for setting up a rally research group and karting research group in 2003. The three groups were brought together in 2004 as the FIA Institute for Motor Sport Safety, with Watkins as president. For the 1995 European Grand Prix, Rubens Barrichello and Max Papis failed their drug tests after the Saturday qualifying session when both tested positive for ephedrine. Watkins later argued that ephedrine had no effect on a driver's ability and that Formula One should not use exactly the same list as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in any case. At the 1995 Australian Grand Prix, Mika H√§kkinen crashed heavily during the Friday qualifying session at the Brewery Bend at high-speed due to a puncture having been sustained by one of his tyres. H√§kkinen was immediately rendered unconscious but did not hit his head against the surrounding wall or cockpit. Two volunteer doctors, Jereme Lockins and Steve Lewis, arrived at the scene in 15 seconds with Watkins arriving last and taking the action of restarting H√§kkinen's heart twice and performing a cricothyroidotomy at the side of the track which he later described as his most satisfying experience during his time in the sport. Watkins was awarded the Mario Andretti Award for Medical Excellence in 1996.Press Snoop: Watkins addresses SAE conference. ===2000s=== In 2002, Watkins was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for recognition of his work in improving the safety of Grand Prix racing. Watkins acted in the defence for David Vissenga in an inquiry into practices into services of the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne where marshal Graham Beverige died after being struck by a wheel from Jacques Villeneuve's car in the 2001 Australian Grand Prix. The University of Liverpool presented him with an honorary doctorate at a ceremony in Liverpool on 8 July 2004. On 26 September 2004, Watkins along with Gary Hartstein were first on the scene when Peter Phillips and three other team members were travelling on the same stretch of road as Watkins and Hartstein when their van collided with another car at high speed. On 12 October 2004, Watkins became the first president of the FIA Foundation for the Automobile and Society, and in December of that year he became the first president of the FIA Institute for Motor Sport Safety, both created in honour of the FIA's hundredth anniversary. ==Retirement== Since his retirement, the FIA has recognised Watkins for being largely responsible for the modernisation of medical standards in Formula One. On 20 January 2005, Watkins announced his retirement from his various medical positions in the FIA, but stated his intention to continue as President of the FIA Institute for Motor Sport Safety. FIA President Max Mosley appointed Watkins's longtime deputy Gary Hartstein as his successor.FIA Formula One Medical Delegate Following his departure, Mosley remarked that \\"Professor Watkins has made a unique contribution to improving the standards of safety and medical intervention throughout motor sport.\\" In September 2005, a campaign to knight Watkins was started by a group of supporters. In July 2008, Watkins was honoured for the award of \\"Most Outstanding Contribution to the Motorsport Industry\\" with the award presented by Martin Brundle at the House of Lords. On 8 December 2011 it was announced that Watkins had stepped down as President of the FIA Institute, but would continue in an honorary role. The day after retiring, he received the FIA Academy Gold Medal for Motor Sport at the official FIA Gala prize-giving ceremony in Dubai. Since 1998 each year the Motorsport Safety Fund organises the Watkins Lecture, which takes place at the Autosport International Show at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham. These lectures usually focus on motorsport safety related matters, and have been delivered by guest speakers such as Max Mosley and Ross Brawn. Watkins himself delivered the inaugural lecture and again in 2007. Watkins wrote or co-authored a number of books on racing safety, including Life at the Limit: Triumph and Tragedy in Formula One. ==Personal life== Watkins was married to Susan, a historian and biographer with whom he had six children; four sons and two daughters. He had a passion for smoking cigars, drinking whisky, and fishing. One of his sons Alastair is a former Media Delegate who worked for the FIA, Kirch Media and was the marketing director for British American Racing. Another son, Antony, is a consultant neurosurgeon (both paediatric and adult) at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and the adjoining Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow. ==Death and legacy== Watkins died on 12 September 2012 at the King Edward VII Hospital in London. His family was at his bedside. Tributes to Watkins were paid by many drivers who have competed in Formula One and other figures within the sport. Watkins was buried in a private ceremony near the border of Scotland on 18 September. This was followed by a memorial service that was held at St Marylebone Parish Church in London on 18 January 2013. The service was attended by 200 people which included figures from within Formula One. At the Singapore Grand Prix, a one-minute silence was held in his honour and a book of remembrance was available for people to sign their condolences during the weekend. This book was presented to the Watkins family on behalf of the FIA, FIA Institute and the Formula One community. In December 2012, Top Gear magazine named Sid one of \\"The Men of the Year 2012\\" for saving the live in Formula One. Richard Hammond said \\"He was a legend throughout motorsport, and he's still saving lives now he's gone\\". A new building bearing Watkins' name was officially opened by Anne, Princess Royal at The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust in Fazakerley, Liverpool on 15 December 2015. Her Royal Highness unveiled a commemorative plaque and a bust of Watkins in honour of his contributions to both motorsport and neurosurgery. ==List of works== * * * ==See also== *GPDA ==References== == External links == * GrandPrix.com: Interview with Sidney Watkins * The FIA Institute for Motor Sport Safety * * \\"Richard Hammond pays tribute to F1's Sid Watkins\\" on BBC Radio 2's The Chris Evans Breakfast Show Category:1928 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Formula One people Category:Alumni of the University of Liverpool Category:English neurosurgeons Category:English motorsport people Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:Medical doctors from Merseyside Category:Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons Category:State University of New York faculty Category:State University of New York Upstate Medical University faculty Category:English agnostics Category:People educated at Prescot Grammar School ","title":"Sid Watkins"},{"id":"845130","text":"Northfields is a London Underground station in Northfields, west London. The station is on the Heathrow branch of the Piccadilly line, between Boston Manor and South Ealing stations. It is located on Northfield Avenue (B452) near Lammas Park, and in Travelcard Zone 3. Interior of the Northfields Tube Station ==History== The route through Northfields station was opened by the District Railway (DR, now the District line), on 1 May 1883 on a line to Hounslow Town (located on Hounslow High Street but now closed). The station opened as Northfield (Ealing) on 16 April 1908.Forgotten Stations of Greater London by J.E.Connor and B.HalfordChronology of London Railways by H.V.Borley The station was renamed as Northfields and Little Ealing on 11 December 1911. External detail of the station The station was rebuilt twice. As a halt, the 1908 station was quite basic and provided only rudimentary shelters for passengers. The first rebuilding took place in the 1910s (possibly in conjunction with the 1911 renaming) and the station was given a proper booking hall on the bridge over the tracks and better platform canopies. In the early 1930s a new Northfields station was built in conjunction with the preparations for the introduction of Piccadilly line services on the Hounslow branch and the new Northfields depot that would house its trains. Located on the east side of Northfields Avenue, the new station was designed by Charles Holden in a modern European style using brick, reinforced concrete and glass. Like the stations at Sudbury Town, Sudbury Hill, Acton Town and Oakwood that Holden also designed, Northfields station features a tall block-like ticket hall rising above a low horizontal structure that contains station offices and shops. The brick walls of the ticket hall are punctuated with panels of clerestory windows and the structure is capped with a flat concrete slab roof. The new station opened on 19 May 1932 with the current name. It has two island platforms serving four sets of tracks (two eastbound and two westbound) and is connected directly to the Northfields depot immediately to the west of the station and south of the tracks. Trains may terminate at Northfields station and then run on to the west to enter the depot. To avoid operational conflicts between the eastbound depot exit track and the westbound running track to Boston Manor, the westbound running track passes under the depot track in a cutting. Trains normally enter and exit service at Northfields although there is also a single track connection from the depot to the westbound running track west of Boston Manor. Northfields Depot 1989 Piccadilly line services started running to Northfields from Acton Town on 1 January 1933 and were extended to run to Hounslow West on 13 March 1933. From this date, the branch was operated jointly by both lines until District line services were withdrawn west of Northfields on 9 October 1964 and between Acton Town and Northfields on 10 October 1964.

It is on the Central line, on the boundary of Zones 3 and 4. Towards Central London the next station is Leyton, while going east from Leytonstone, the line divides into two branches. On the direct route to Woodford and Epping the next stop is Snaresbrook, and on the Hainault loop it is Wanstead. ==History== The railway line from Loughton Branch Junction (on the Lea Valley line between and ) to Loughton was built by the Eastern Counties Railway, and opened on 22 August 1856. A station at Leytonstone was opened on the same day. In turn it became, from 1862, part of the Great Eastern Railway system and then in 1923 part of the London & North Eastern Railway before being transferred to London Transport in 1947. This formed part of the \\"New Works Programme 1935 ‚Äì 1940\\" that was to see major changes at Leytonstone with the station becoming the junction of the existing Epping branch, newly electrified, with the new tube tunnel running under Eastern Avenue towards Newbury Park. This work saw a complete reconstruction of the station along with the removal of the level crossing at Church Lane and its replacement by an underbridge. The work stopped in May 1940 due to wartime priorities; further delays were caused by the station buildings being hit by a German bomb in January 1944. During the war, the new tunnels were used as an aircraft component factory; the part closest to Leytonstone was a public air-raid shelter.How the Railway Came to Leytonstone, Alan Simpson, Leyton & Leytonstone Historical Society 2006 The station was first served by the Central line on 5 May 1947 when it became the temporary terminus of the line, passengers changing on to steam shuttle onwards to Epping. This ceased on 14 December 1947 with the extension of Underground services to Woodford and Newbury Park. ===Notable events=== * In honour of the centenary of the birth of film director Sir Alfred Hitchcock (born 13 August 1899 in Leytonstone), the London Borough of Waltham Forest commissioned the Greenwich Mural Workshop to create a series of mosaics of Hitchcock's life and works in the tube station. Work was started in June 2000 and the mosaics were unveiled on 3 May 2001. * Three people were injured inside the station's ticket hall during the evening of 5 December 2015, with one suffering serious knife injuries. The Metropolitan Police arrested the attacker inside the station after using Tasers against him. Video footage later emerged of the attacker repeatedly shouting \\"this is for Syria\\". A remark shouted at the attacker by a witness, \\"You ain‚Äôt no Muslim, bruv‚Äù, resulted in considerable media comment and was subsequently praised by the then Prime Minister, David Cameron. ==Today== The station has three platforms. The centre platform is generally used for through services going westbound, but can be used to terminate trains from both directions. However, due to the configuration of the tracks, trains going eastbound from this platform can only access the Epping branch. Trains needing access to the Hainault branch can do so by shunting west of the station, and then running into the normal eastbound platform via a crossover. ==Connections== London Buses routes 66, 145, 257, 339, W13, W14, W15, W16 and W19 and night route N8 serve the station and bus station. ==Gallery== File:Leytonstone tube station 01.jpgThe westbound platforms at Leytonstone, looking west File:Leytonstone station eastbound east.JPGView of platforms File:Leytonstone station junction.JPGLeytonstone junction, showing the diverge between Epping and Hainault branches, the latter diverging and heading underground File:Leytonstone station entrance west.JPGWestern entrance facing Grove Green Road and bus stand.

The band is known for songs with piercing vocals and an extremely loud style of noise-influenced punk which emphasizes heavy distortion and feedback. They coined the phrase \\"jet rock 'n' roll\\", which they also use to describe their musical style ‚Äì an energetic cross between the Ramones, Link Wray, rockabilly, 77 punk, and garage rock. The band is part of Sony Music Japan's Ki/oon Records division. Guitar Wolf has released thirteen studio albums internationally as well as a live album, numerous singles, and a retrospective compilation called Golden Black. The band members have also been featured in two B-grade science fiction horror movies: Wild Zero and Sore Losers. A collection of Guitar Wolf's most popular videos and live performances have been compiled into a limited edition DVD titled Red Idol. Guitar Wolf is a staple at music festivals in their native Japan, and typically embark on lengthy tours both domestically and internationally after the release of a new album. ==History== ===Formation=== Guitar Wolf at Burger Boogaloo, Mosswood Park, Oakland 2017 Guitarist Seiji was born in Nagasaki Prefecture, but moved to nearby Shimane Prefecture while he was still young. Upon graduating high school he moved to Tokyo where he became lead vocalist for the band Far East Punch. With a strong desire to play guitar and after giving up on several attempts, Seiji finally dedicated himself to the instrument after coming across a copy of the single \\"Rumble\\" by Link Wray & His Ray Men at Tower Records in Shibuya. He has stated that the 1958 instrumental \\"saved his music life.\\"Dudes Magazine [paperback], Issue 20, Page 34, published Winter 2012‚Äì13. Seiji met bassist Billy while the two were working in, Harajuku, the former in a used leather jacket, '50s clothing and antique shop and the latter in a punk rock shop located behind it. Realizing they shared similar musical tastes, the two decided to form a rock and roll band together. After convincing Seiji's coworker Narita to accompany them on drums, Guitar Wolf formed in Harajuku in 1987. Each member adopted a Ramones- style surname reflecting the instrument he played: Seiji became Guitar Wolf, Billy became Bass Wolf, and Narita became Drum Wolf, though Narita would depart the group shortly thereafter. For a brief period Seiji's younger brother Masaharu - himself currently in the Tokyo band Thunderroads - filled in on drums before a permanent solution in the form of current drummer T≈çru was found, a suggestion made by Rockin' Enocky Thunderbird, guitarist of the surf band Jackie & The Cedrics and Seiji's personal guitar hero. In time the band would come to develop its own unique strain of punk rock music, fusing multiple genres together into what the band described as Jet Rock 'n' Roll. Although Guitar Wolf has cited Joan Jett as an important musical and stylistic influence, contrary to some reports, the term Jet Rock is not derived from Joan Jett's name. The term's origin is, rather, attributed to the sound of a jet plane. In an interview conducted in St. Louis April 5, 2012, frontman Seiji clarified, \\"I love jet plane. I love noisy music, too. So... There were records... many records... every record have no big sounds. So... easy to listen. I hate that! So! I add jet sounds. Bwaaaahng! Explosion!\\" In the same interview, when asked who created the term, Jet Rock, Seiji replied, \\"Me. Yeah, yeah. So we are #1 Japanese Jet Rock Band.\\"Dudes Magazine [paperback], Issue 20, Page 35, published Winter 2012‚Äì13. ===First releases=== By 1994, the band had released three albums and a single. Their first album, Wolf Rock!, having been recorded in Seiji's basement and released in America by Goner Records - incidentally being the label's first release and its impetus for inception - after Goner founder and Oblivians member Eric Friedl saw the band at the second Garage Shock festival in Bellingham, Washington. Having received the band's permission, Friedl released the demo tape that the band had given him, becoming their first release. Their second album, Kung Fu Ramone, released through Bag of Hammers; their third, by and large a retooling of Kung Fu Ramone titled Run Wolf Run being their debut studio album and the first released in Japan on the label Less Than TV. 1994 also saw the release of their first single, Somethin' Else b/w Red Rockabilly, again through Bag of Hammers. ===Later work=== Guitar Wolf at Burger Boogaloo, Mosswood Park, Oakland 2017 The period between 1994 and 2000 is when Guitar Wolf released much of their most well known material. In 1996 an in-store performance at a New York City record store secured the band a contract with Matador Records, who issued the band's fourth album Missile Me! that same year. Guitar Wolf would continue releasing albums with Matador until 1999's Jet Generation, an album which Matador Records claims is the loudest album ever put to wax and included a warning that playing it could potentially damage the listener's audio equipment. These two albums contain many of the band's most well known songs, including the two titular tracks and \\"Can-Nana Fever.\\" On April 24, 2019 it was announced that Guitar Wolf's latest album Love & Jett would be released on Jack White's Third Man Records on May 10, 2019. A US Tour with Nashville Pussy would happen to promote the album as well. ===Film appearances=== In 1997, all three original members of Guitar Wolf appeared in the John Michael McCarthy's The Sore Losers in the role of the mysterious strangers alongside Memphis indie rock musician Jack Oblivian. McCarthy also directed the music video for their song \\"All Night De Buttobase!! (Roaring All Night!!)\\". In 2000, Guitar Wolf starred in the Japanese rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll \\"zombie horror\\" movie, Wild Zero, directed by Tetsuro Takeuchi. The band play themselves in as they take on crazed fans, zombies, and an alien invasion. Guitar Wolf are featured heavily in the movie's soundtrack. A sequel, tentatively titled: Wild Zero 2: The Strongest Blood of Humanity, was announced in July 2019 when the film screened at the New York Museum of Art and Design as part of its Global Punk Film series, though no release date has been confirmed. The band has also appeared in the documentaries Get Action!! (2014, dir. Jun'ya Kond≈ç), and Garage Rockin' Craze (2017, dir. Mario Cuzic), the former exploring another well-known Japanese garage rock band Guitar Wolf considered something of a rival, Teengenerate, and the latter exploring the formation and evolution of the Tokyo garage punk scene and its de facto founder, DJ Daddy-O-Nov. Both films feature interviews with Seiji and the latter features live footage as well. Seiji also has a cameo in the 2017 Australian mockumentary Top Knot Detective (2017, dir. Aaron McCann & Dominic Pearce). ===Death of Bass Wolf=== Billy (Bass Wolf) performing at thumb In 2002 the band made the move to Narnack Records where the band continued to release material until 2005 when the band released their greatest hits album, \\"Golden Black.\\" That same year after completing a U.S. tour, the band returned home to Japan where bassist Billy suffered a fatal heart attack at the age of 38. Billy, whose real name was Hideaki Sekiguchi, died in Tokyo on March 31, 2005, and is survived by his wife and two children. In September 2005, Guitar Wolf played their first show with their new bassist, U.G, a co-worker at the construction site where T≈çru worked who had up to that point only been interested in hip-hop and had never touched a bass guitar in his life. U.G would play with the band for the next 12 years, departing in 2017. Their frenetic replacement, Hikaru, would only serve a tenure of less than a year before being replaced with current bassist, Gotz. ==Jet clothing== The band have their own line of Jet clothing consisting of jackets, pants, T-shirts and belts. The Guitar Wolf motorcycle jacket, a variation of the 613 Perfecto called 613GW, is manufactured by Schott NYC. In 2018, alongside big name Japanese bands The Cro-Magnons, The Bawdies, and Stompin' Riffraffs, Guitar Wolf headlined Wings, Wheels, & Rock 'N' Roll, a show sponsored by British motorcycle jacket maker Lewis Leathers to commemorate the brand opening a Tokyo store. They have since released a model for Guitar Wolf, known as the 723 Memphis. ==Discography== ===Singles=== *Guitar Wolf at Burger Boogaloo, Mosswood Park, Oakland 2017Somethin' Else 7\\" (Bag Of Hammers, 1995, BOH 026) * Missile Me 7\\" (Bag Of Hammers, 1996, BOH 041) * Satisfaction 7\\" (Bag Of Hammers, 1996, BOH 042) * Can-Nana Fever 7\\" (Wallabies, 1997, WAL-018) * Bad Reputation 7\\" (Wallabies, 1997, WAL-019) * Kawasaki Z11 7750 Rock 'N' Roll 7\\" (Matador, 1997, OLE-271-7) * Kaminari One 7\\" (Less Than TV, 1998, CH-53) * Murder By Rock! 12\\" (Ki/oon, 1999, KSC2 305) * God Speed You 12\\" (Ki/oon, 2000, KSC2 320) * I Love You, Ok 12\\" (Ki/oon, 2001, KSC2 373) * Jet Satisfaction CD/DVD (Ki/oon, 2009, KSCL 1528-9) ===Vinyl LPs=== * Wolf Rock!

It is considered one of the most significant copies of the Tales. ==History== Written most likely in the first or second decade of the fifteenth century, the early history of the manuscript is uncertain, but it seems to have been owned by John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford (1408‚Äì1462). The manuscript takes its popular name from the fact that it later belonged to Sir Thomas Egerton (1540‚Äì1617), Baron Ellesmere and Viscount Brackley, who apparently obtained it from Roger North, 2nd Baron North (1530/31-1600). The library of manuscripts, known as the Bridgewater Library, remained at the Egerton house, Ashridge, Hertfordshire, until 1802 when it was removed to London. Francis Egerton, created Earl of Ellesmere in 1846, inherited the library, and it remained in the family until its sale to Henry Huntington by John Francis Granville Scrope Egerton (1872‚Äì1944), 4th Earl of Ellesmere. Huntington purchased the Bridgewater library privately in 1917 through Sotheby's. The manuscript is now in the collection of the Huntington Library in San Marino, California (EL 26 C 9). ==Description== The Ellesmere manuscript is a highly polished example of scribal workmanship, with a great deal of elaborate illumination and, notably, a series of illustrations of the various narrators of the Tales (including a famous one of Chaucer himself, mounted on a horse). As such, it was clearly a de luxe product, commissioned by a very wealthy patron. The manuscript is written on fine vellum and the leaves are approximately 400mm by 284mm in size; there are 240 leaves, of which 232 contain the text of the Tales.The Ellesmere Chaucer , Long Island University. == Illuminations == In order of appearance in the Ellesmere Chaucer (note that not all storytellers have an illumination): *Knight (fol. 10r) * Miller (fol. 34v) * Reeve (fol. 42r) * Cook (fol. 47r) * Man of Law (fol. 50v) * Wife of Bath (fol. 72r) * Friar (fol. 76v) * Summoner (fol. 81r) * Clerk of Oxford (fol. 88r) * Merchant (fol. 102v) * Squire (fol. 115v) *Franklin (fol. 123v) * Physician (fol. 133r) * Pardoner (fol. 138r) * Shipman (fol. 143v) * Prioress (fol. 148v) * Chaucer (fol. 153v) * Monk and his greyhounds (fol. 169r) * Nun's Priest (fol. 179r) * Second Nun (fol. 187r) * Canon's Yeoman (fol. 194r) * Manciple (fol. 203r) *Parson (fol. 206v) ==Scribe and its relation to other manuscripts== The Ellesmere manuscript is thought to be very early in date, being written shortly after Chaucer's death. It is seen as an important source for efforts to reconstruct Chaucer's original text and intentions, though John M. Manly and Edith Rickert in their Text of the Canterbury Tales (1940) noted that whoever edited the manuscript probably made substantial revisions, tried to regularise spelling, and put the individual Tales into a smoothly running order. Up until this point the Ellesmere manuscript had been used as the 'base text' by several editions, such as that of W. W. Skeat, with variants checked against British Library, Harley MS. 7334. Linne Mooney identified Ellesmere's scribe as Adam Pinkhurst, a man employed by Chaucer himself, but recent scholarship has claimed that this identification is without merit.The claim was put forth by Linne R. Mooney, 'Chaucer's Scribe', Speculum, 81 (2006), 91-138; for the most extensive rebuttal see Lawrence Warner, Chaucer's Scribes: London Textual Production, 1384-1432 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018). Further discussion in the Wikipedia entry for Adam Pinkhurst. The same scribe appears to have been responsible for writing the Hengwrt Manuscript of the Tales, now considered the earliest, most authoritative, and closest to Chaucer's holograph. This would also imply, however, that the revisions seen in the Ellesmere manuscript would have been carried out by someone who had worked with Chaucer, knew his intentions for the Tales, and had access to draft materials. The Ellesmere manuscript is conventionally referred to as El in studies of the Tales and their textual history. A facsimile edition is available.

It is an important source for Chaucer's text, and was possibly written by someone with access to original authorial holograph, now lost. The Hengwrt Chaucer is part of a collection called the Peniarth Manuscripts which is included by UNESCO in its UK Memory of the World Register, a list of documentary heritage which holds cultural significance specific to the UK. It is catalogued as MS Peniarth 392D. ==History of the manuscript== Hengwrt, the seat of the Vaughan family, 1793 The opening folio of the Hengwrt Chaucer manuscript contains the beginning of the General Prologue. The Hengwrt Chaucer has been in Wales for at least 400 years. This was one of the collection of manuscripts amassed at the mansion of Hengwrt, near Dolgellau, Gwynedd, by Welsh antiquary Robert Vaughan (c.1592‚Äì1667); the collection later passed to the newly established National Library of Wales. The Hengwrt manuscript's very early ownership is unknown, but recent research suggests that Chaucer himself may have partly supervised the making of the manuscript, before his death in October 1400, according to the Welsh newspaper The Western Mail.\\"Original Chaucer Masterpiece on Show for the World to See.\\" Western Mail (Cardiff, Wales). 2014. Accessed via HighBeam Research August 9, 2017 (subscription required). https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-365966888.html By the 16th century it can be identified as belonging to Fouke Dutton, a draper of Chester who died in 1558. It then seems to have passed into the ownership of the Bannester family of Chester and Caernarfon, and through them was in the possession of an Andrew Brereton by 1625; by the middle of the 17th century it had been acquired by Vaughan. ==Description== Peniarth MS 392 D contains 250 folios with a page size of around 29 x 20.5 centimetres. It is written on heavily stained and rather damaged parchment. Vermin have eaten around nine centimeters from the outer corners of the leaves. It is less complete than the Ellesmere manuscript, and the tales are in an order that is unique to itself. The main textual hand has been identified with one found in several other manuscripts of the period (see below); there are a number of other hands in the manuscript, including one of a person who attempted to fill in several gaps in the text. This has been tentatively identified as the hand of the poet Thomas Hoccleve.Mosser, D. W.The Hengwrt Manuscript Description , Canterbury Tales Project There is some illumination in blue, gold and pink, used on the border and on initial letters at the opening of individual tales and prologues, but the manuscript contains no illustrations. ==Scribe and relationship to other manuscripts== The lavishly illustrated Ellesmere manuscript, which for many years, following the examples of the editor Frederick Furnivall and W. W. Skeat, was used as the base text for more modern editions of the Canterbury Tales, is now thought to have been written by the same scribe, though the arrangement of the individual tales in the two manuscripts varies widely. Linne Mooney, a literary scholar at the University of York, has claimed to have identified this scribe as Adam Pinkhurst, the same Adam to whom Chaucer wrote a poem, admonishing him for his occasionally inaccurate copying skills;Nagle, M. Finding Adam , Umaine Today, Oct/Nov 2004 more recent scholarship has claimed, however, that this identification is without merit.See most extensively Lawrence Warner, Chaucer's Scribes: London Textual Production, 1384-1432 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018); further references and discussion in the Wikipedia entry for Adam Pinkhurst. Since the work of John M. Manly and Edith Rickert in compiling their Text of the Canterbury Tales (1940), the Hengwrt manuscript has had a much higher degree of prominence in attempts to reconstruct Chaucer's text, displacing the previously prominent Ellesmere and Harley MS. 7334. Recent scholarship has shown that the variant spellings given in the Hengwrt manuscript likely reflect Chaucer's own spelling practices in his East Midlands / London dialect of Middle English, while the Ellesmere text shows evidence of a later attempt to regularise spelling; Hengwrt is therefore probably very close to the original authorial holograph.Horobin, S. The Language of the Hengwrt Chaucer , Canterbury Tales Project Following the terminology developed by Manly and Rickert, the manuscript is conventionally referred to as Hg in most editions giving variant readings.See Manly and Rickert, The Text of the Canterbury Tales, I: Descriptions of the Manuscripts, 1940, p.266 ==See also== *William Maurice (antiquary) *Robert Vaughan (antiquary) ==References== ==External links== *Canterbury Tales Project digital facsimile of the whole Hengwrt Chaucer manuscript, edited by Estelle Stubbs *Specimen pages Category:Literary illuminated manuscripts Category:The Canterbury Tales Category:Peniarth collection ","title":"Hengwrt Chaucer"},{"id":"845157","text":"NNN may refer to: * N-Nitrosonornicotine, a nitrosamine carcinogen found in tobacco * NAM News Network, a news network set up by non-aligned countries * Naomi Nari Nam, a figure skater often referred to by her initials * National Numeracy Network (NNN), a professional organization that promotes numeracy in the United States * National Retail Properties, (ticker symbol: NNN) a real estate investment trust in the United States * Neal 'n' Nikki, a 2005 Indian movie starring Uday Chopra and Tanisha and was directed by Arjun Sablok * New Nordic Norm, a type of binding for cross-country (Nordic) skis * Newspaper National Network, a marketing partnership of the top 25 newspaper companies in America and the Newspaper Association of America * Nippon News Network, the Japanese television news network * nnn (file manager), a free text-based file manager for Unix-like systems * Norddeutsche Neueste Nachrichten, a German newspaper * NNN Lease (triple net lease), a lease agreement in which the renter is responsible for paying property taxes, insurance, and maintenance charges * Norsk Naerings- og Nytelsesmiddelarbeiderforbund, the Norwegian Union of Food, Beverage and Allied Workers * The \\"Disconnect\\" command code in Telex usage; by extension, \\"stop\\" in other uses * No Nut November, an Internet challenge *NNN, the production code for the 1972 Doctor Who serial The Mutants ==See also== * nn (disambiguation) ","title":"NNN"},{"id":"845160","text":" PNS/M Hangor (S-131) (nicknamed: \\"Shark\\") was a diesel-electric submarine that served in the Pakistan Navy from 1969 until its decommissioning in 2006. Hangor (S131) was the lead ship of her class, designed and constructed by France after a long and complicated negotiation which started in 1966. In 1969, Hangor was commissioned in the Submarine Command (SUBCOM) when she reported back to her home base in Karachi from Paris. Hangor, under the command of Commander Ahmed Tasnim, sank the Indian Navy's , an anti- submarine frigate, with one homing torpedo on 9 December 1971 during the western front of the third war with India in 1971. This was the only recorded submarine kill after World War II until the Falklands War, when the Royal Navy's nuclear submarine, , sank the Argentine Navy cruiser, . ==Acquisition and initial deployment== After the second war with India in 1965, the Indian Navy underwent a rapid modernization and expansion, causing the Pakistan Navy's focus to shift towards strengthening their existing Submarine Command (COMSUBS) due to unable to acquire fighter jets from the Air Force. In 1966, the Ayub administration began the development and acquisition of the from France. France renamed these submarines according to the Pakistan Navy's standards. Hangor was the lead ship of her class, which included and , all commissioned in 1970. Training of the crew took place in 1968. Notably, Hangors officers that served in 1971 included: *Commander Ahmed Tasnim, the commanding officer. *Lieutenant-Commander A. U. Khan, second-in-command and the navigation officer *Lieutenant Fasih Bokhari, the navigation officer. *Lieutenant R. A. Kadri, the electrical officer. The ship's first war-time deployment was in August 1971, gathering intelligence on the Indian Navy and clearing the Manora Island and Ormara Bay in the coastal areas of Pakistan. Hangor reported back to base in September 1971 but was again deployed in November 1971. As Indian covert involvement in the East Pakistan grew, the Navy NHQ in Karachi deployed its only (albeit aging) long-range submarine, , under the command of Z.M. Khan, to pick up intelligence and track off the Bay of Bengal in November 1971. According to Rear-Admiral R. A. Kadri in 1999, the assigned mission was considered quite difficult and dangerous, with the submarine squadron sailing under the assumption that the dangerous nature of this mission meant a great mortal risk to the submarine and her crew. ==Service with Pakistan Navy== ===Western Front of Indo-Pakistani war of 1971=== On the midnight of 26 November 1971, Hangor sailed from its base with a load of torpedoes to patrol the Bombay Harbour. Soon after deployment, defects were noted in the ship's computers but were soon repaired as the patrol continued. Initially, there were two contacts that were picked up by the computers and were identified as warships, ranging . The ship could not pursue its targets due to the warships' speed and the distance between them. Hangors crew did, however, manage to predict the warships' movements. At midnight of 2/3 December 1971, Hangor, remaining submerged in a northerly direction, investigated radio transmissions intercepted from the warships belonging to the Western Naval Command of the Indian Navy that would launch a first missile attack on Karachi. Hangor was passed over by the large Squadron of the Western fleet of the Indian Navy. The cruiser passed directly over the submarine. All transmissions and computers were shut down to avoid the detection by the Indian fleet, and once passed over Cmdr. Tasnim broke the radio silence and communicated with the Navy NHQ to warn of the attack, but this message was intercepted. On 3 December 1971, the Indian Navy dispatched two ASW frigates, and , under the command of Capt. M. N. Mulla. On 4 December 1971, Navy NHQ communicated with Hangor, giving her war codes to attack the Indian Navy's armada. On 9/10 December 1971, at 19:00, Hangor detected the possible signature of the two Indian frigates dispatched in response to the intercepted communications. Later, around midnight, Cdr. Tasnim ordered Hangor to dive deep to carry out a blind (sonar only) approach as the torpedo team concentrated on tracking the two targets as they gradually came within firing range. At 19:57, the submarine fired a down-the-throat shot with a homing torpedo at Kirpan from a depth of . The torpedo was tracked, but no explosion was heard. It was then speculated that the torpedo had missed its target, and the moment Kirpan sensed the torpedo, the captain of Kirpan realized that the ship was under attack turned away at maximum speed from the scene. Hangor had struck first, but had failed to hit hard. As Kirpan fled the battle, Khukri, to its south, knowing the direction from which the torpedo had come, increased speed and came straight for an attack on Hangor. As Khukri came in for an attack, Hangors attack team shifted targeting to Khukri, quickly firing a second torpedo. The second torpedo was fired at the approaching Khukri and was followed by a heavy and loud explosion as the torpedo struck the magazine of Khukri. Shortly before the impact, Hangor detected the direct orders of Captain M. N. Mulla ordering evasive manoeuvres. INS Kirpan moved into the scene, hoping to engage Hangor with a hasty dropping of the depth charge, but a third torpedo locked onto Kirpans tail, followed by a loud explosion. Kirpan was not sunk but there was a substantial amount of physical damage that led Kirpan to flee the battle scene by turning west towards deep waters. Hangor moved into searching for survivors in a hope to rescue but Khukri sank in matter of two minutes before Hangor could reach it. The casualty roster listed 18 officers and 176 sailors aboard Khukri and it remains as the Indian Navy's most costly wartime casualty in terms of lives lost. Kirpan returned to the scene next day to execute the rescue operation along with INS Katchal but left without success. After this incident, there was a massive search and destroy mission led by the Western Fleet, indiscriminately dropping depth charges hoping to sink Hangor. Cdr. Tasnim had Hangor submerged for almost a week, returning to its base with depleted lead batteries during the night of 13 December 1971. According to his personal admission in 2001, Tasnim maintained: \\"An extensive air search combined with surface ships made our life miserable but with the intelligent evasive action we managed to survive these attacks and arrived in Karachi safely after the ceasefire.\\" ==Legacy== ===Decommissioning and preservation=== Over the successive years, it served in the Navy with distinction until decommissioning in 2006. In a ceremony on 2 January 2006, Hangor was decommissioned from the Pakistan Navy; it was soon converted to serve as a museum ship at Pakistan Maritime Museum. In its memory, Pakistan remembers and celebrates 9 December as Hangor Day. ===Honors and awards=== In recognition of her service, Hangor was decorated with multiple gallantry and wartime awards and honors. She is regarded in the Navy as having the highest number of operational gallantry awards given to a single warship of Pakistan Navy. { style=\\"margin: 0 auto; text-align: center\\"    103px -  4√óSitara-e-Jurat  6√óTamgha-i-Jurat  14√óSword of Honour } == See also == * PNS Muhafiz * Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 * Timeline of the Bangladesh Liberation War * Military plans of the Bangladesh Liberation War * Mitro Bahini order of battle * Pakistan Army order of battle, December 1971 * Evolution of Pakistan Eastern Command plan * 1971 Bangladesh genocide * Operation Searchlight * Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts * Military history of India * List of military disasters * List of wars involving India ==ReferencesCategory:1969 ships Category:Ships built in France Category:Hangor-class submarines (Daphn√©-class) Category:Indo- Pakistani War of 1971 Category:Museum ships in Pakistan ","title":"PNS Hangor (S131)"},{"id":"845165","text":"Elias Levy (also known as Aleph One) is a computer scientist.

The six groups were: *Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) Resistance *Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) P.V.

Nagi Reddy, legends of the Telangana Rebellion. The party followed a combination of both armed underground and parliamentary methods of struggle. Initially things went well for the party, and in the 1994 assembly elections of Andhra Pradesh Vidhan Sabha it won a seat. It had launched 13 candidates in all and won the Sirsilla assembly seat in Karimnagar district. N. V. Krishnaiah was the candidate who won the Sirsilla seat. A trade union, All India Federation of Trade Unions, and a peasants movement were built up. But the unity did not last for long. In 1996 a group left the party, and they later formed Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) Unity Initiative (today part of Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) (Kanu Sanyal)). A series of splits followed. Towards the end of the 1990s the party reoriented itself towards the underground armed struggle, and pulled out of the open mass work. ==Modern== Today the party is primarily concentrated in Andhra Pradesh. The party split into several factions, which work with little or without coordination. The main faction is the group led by Koora Rajanna. COM.Subhash is the Andhra Pradesh state secretary of the party. The All India secretary of the party is COM.Misro The party conducts armed struggle through dalams. Police sources has claimed that CPI (ML) Janashakti has 200 to 300 armed cadres.keralanext.com One break-away group is Communist Party of United States of India (also referred to as the Janashakti Veeranna faction). Another faction, the South Regional Provincial Committee, merged with Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) (Chandra Pulla Reddy) on 11 April 2004, thus forming the Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) Janashakti (Chandra Pulla Reddy). Ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, CPI (ML) Janashakti signed a joint boycott declaration together with the Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) People's War and the MCC(I). On 23 September 2004, the Andhra Pradesh state government declared they would hold peace talks with CPI (ML) Janashakti and Peoples War Group. These peace talks went in vain when both the government and the revolutionary parties did not hold trust in the other. Later Koora Rajanna was arrested by the police in Uttar Pradesh state of India and was sent to Warangal central jail. Many cases that were booked on Koora Rajanna were cancelled for lack of proper evidences. In 2007 Virasam AP state secretary was affiliated with CPI (M-L) Janashakti. He was also arrested in July 2009 and Adhikaara Pratinidhi Azaad (Com. Subhash) became AP state secretary. The party had a leading role in the Andhra Pradesh revolutionary movement. AP State Committee of Janasakthi declared that Mr. Koora Rajanna was not a member of CPI(M-L) Janashakti. In April 2011 at Guntur district of AP, 7 members of CPI (M-L) Janashakti were arrested and 2dbbl guns, one 8mm rifle, one 9mm pistol, and two tapanchas were lost at this incident.

A science fiction series and political satire, it was set in the U.S., particularly Chicago, Illinois, in the early 2030s. Writers besides Chaykin included Steven Grant, J.M. DeMatteis, Alan Moore and John Francis Moore. ==Publication history== American Flagg, which ran 50 issues (October 1983 ‚Äì March 1988),American Flagg at the Grand Comics Database was one of the first titles to be published by First Comics, an early alternative press comics company founded in Evanston, Illinois in 1983. Unusually for the time, the company offered its freelance writers and artists creator rights, including ownership of their creations. Regardless, writer-artist Howard Chaykin, then living in New York City, felt trepidation when First Comics approached him to do a project. He recalled in 2010, Chaykin devised a series set in 2031, a high-tech but spiritually empty, consumerist world in which the American government has relocated to Mars, leaving what remains of the U.S. to be governed by the all-encompassing corporation known as the Plex. The series star is Reuben Flagg, a former TV star drafted into the Plexus Rangers and posted as a deputy in Chicago, Illinois.Schweier, p. 4. The first 12 issues, running through cover-date September 1984, consisted of four interlocking, three-issue story arcs. Chaykin recalled his difficulty in producing 28 pages of art and script monthly. \\"I was still a smoker and a drinker at the time. And [the output was such that] I'd never done anything like that before, and it was insane. It just devoured my life [and] I had no assistants. I didn't know how to work with an assistant at that point, and it was a very difficult process. ... I was trying to do a fairly high-quality product and I didn't want to slough it off.\\" Chaykin made wide use of Craftint Duoshade illustration boards for American Flagg!, which in the period before computers, enabled him to add shaded textures to the finished art. Ken Bruzenak's lettering and logowork also won notice, as it was integral to American Flagg's futuristic, trademark- littered ambiance. American Flagg's first dozen issues form one complete story that has influenced comic creators including Brian Michael Bendis and Warren Ellis. The comic made a huge splash at the 1984 Eagle Awards, the United Kingdom's pre-eminent comics awards. Chaykin and American Flagg! were nominated for ten awards,\\"Eagle Nominations Announced; American Flagg!

Accessed Jan. 22, 2020. After issue #12, Chaykin continued the series while also working on such other projects as his revamp of The Shadow for DC Comics and the graphic novel Time2, based on characters introduced in a one-off American Flagg! special in 1986. During this time, Alan Moore wrote a back-up story that ran several issues and concluded in an issue-length story. Eventually, Chaykin left, to be replaced on a regular basis by first Steven Grant then J.M. DeMatteis. Grant left after only seven issues due to creative friction with the series's new artist, Mark Badger. According to Grant, he had wanted to continue doing stories in the same style that Chaykin had established, while Badger wanted to take the series in new directions. Chaykin returned for a brief run to wrap up storylines before the first volume ended in March 1988. The title was relaunched a few months later as Howard Chaykin's Amerikan Flagg!. This run saw Chaykin return to write the first issue before handing over to John Francis Moore, with Mike Vosburg and Richard Ory penciling and inking the interior art, but the franchise failed to recapture its early success and was canceled after 12 issues. ==Plot synopsis== The story takes place in the year 2031, after a series of worldwide crises called the Year of the Domino (1996) has forced the U.S. government and the heads of major corporations to relocate to Hammarskjold Center, on Mars (\\"temporarily, of course\\"). In the wake of the American government leaving the planet and the Soviet Union collapsing from Islamic insurrections, there was a power shift throughout the world, with Brazilian Union of the Americas and the Pan-African League becoming the new superpowers on Earth. However, the exiled American government, its corporate backers, and a group of technicians in the defected Soviet lunar colony of Gagaringrad form the Plex: a giant, interplanetary union of corporate and government concerns that conduct commerce and govern the United States from its capital on Mars. Many population centers are grouped around massive, fortified arcologies called Plexmalls and the law is enforced by the Plexus Rangers, the absentee Plex's Earthside militia. The Plex has formed the Tricentennial Recovery Committee, to get America \\"back on track for '76\\", but the TRC is in reality a plan to sell the United States off to the new superpowers and to leech off the remaining inhabitants before gaining true self-sufficiency. As a result, the Plex has outlawed non-combat related education, organized sports such as basketball and personal aircraft, restricted media to only one outlet, the Plex itself (although it has multiple channels), and advocates and glorifies the use of political violence amongst independent policlubs by providing money and firearms for its hit TV show Firefight All Night LIVE!, and covertly sterilizes the population by using a combination contraceptive and antibiotic called Ma√±anacillin to reduce the population. This all changes when former television star Reuben Flagg is drafted and transferred to Chicago's Plexmall to replace the local Ranger Hilton \\"Hammerhead\\" Krieger's fallen partner. He witnesses widespread graft and corruption throughout the Plexmall, but also a series of subliminal messages implanted in a television show that are causing outbreaks of gang violence. After he uses his emergency powers to interrupt the broadcast, he not only ends the violence, but also brings forth a series of events that causes the Plex to send in covert agents, the death of Hilton, and the unveiling of Q-USA, a secret TV station owned and operated by Krieger that opens Flagg's eyes to the nature of the Plex. As the series progressed, Chaykin took less and less of a direct role in scripting and plotting the stories out, and by the third year of its run, he really had nothing to do with the book other than cover art. Stories began to violate the rules that Chaykin had explicitly stated in the writer's bible for the series (for instance, California was said to have slid into the Pacific Ocean, but in the final year of the book, California was merely shown to have been abandoned for reasons that were vague at best), and characterizations began to drift considerably as well. (Among other things, Flagg abandoned his interest in 1930s jazz, and was frequently shown listening to late-1960s rock, as well as becoming more of a traditional stern-jawed good-guy hero). After trying and failing several times to shore up declining interests, First Comics decided to lure Chaykin back into the writer's seat. \\"American Flagg!\\" wrapped up its principal storyline with issue #50. By this time, Reuben Flagg had traveled to Mars, overthrown the Plex, and become President of the United States. He then decided to separate Illinois from the United States and run it as his own personal fiefdom. All issues of this series took place in the year 2031. The next year, the comic was re-launched under the name Howard Chaykin's Amerikan Flagg! (The \\"K\\" and a reversed \\"r\\" were to reflect the fact that most of this series took place in Russia) and picked up from where the earlier book had left off (in 2032). There is some difference of opinion as to whether this new book was intended to be a limited run, or open-ended as is the norm with comics. In either case, it ended after twelve issues. The final issue ends with a photo album of the Flagg's future domestic life, with many kids, a screaming shrew of a wife, and a balding, overweight Flagg. ==Characters== *Reuben Flagg, born in 2000 at Hammarskjold Center, Mars, to Axel and Rebecca Flagg, was a stand-up comic and popular television star of the show Mark Thrust, Sexus Ranger. After he was made superfluous by CGI technology, he joined the Plexus Rangers and emigrated to Earth, being stationed in the Chicago Plexmall. Flagg is Jewish, and his parents' \\"undesirably bohemian\\" attitudes have given him an idealistic view of the United States that runs contrary to the Plex. He has a desire to set things right again, and through inheriting Q-USA, begins to set on that path. *Raul the cat, an intelligent, talking orange tabby housecat. With the exception of his intelligence and his ability to speak (an ability whose origin is never explained), he appears to be otherwise a normal house pet. However, he has a customized set of cybernetic gloves, designed by Mandy Krieger, that give him opposable thumbs. *Hilton \\"Hammerhead\\" Krieger, was Flagg's superior at the Chicago Plexmall. A co-founder of the Genetic Warlords motorcycle gang along with Charles Blitz, but after his 13th arrest, the Plex drafts him because of his criminal experience. Intending to take advantage of the fledgling organization, he meets his future wife Peggy and stays with the Rangers. He does not trust anyone, not C.K., the mayor, not his wife Peg, not his daughter Mandy, and, while a Plexus Ranger, he especially does not trust the Plex. He runs an underground television station called Q-USA that broadcasts illegal sports, pornography, and pre-collapse movies and television shows. He is killed by a Plex secret agent, and his cat Raul gives Flagg the keys to the station. He also leaves behind a video explaining to his \\"heir\\" the truth of the Plex and the rules he wishes his successor to follow. *Amanda \\"Mandy\\" Krieger, daughter of Hilton, she is the air traffic controller for O'Hare Chicago Plexport. However, since the O'Hare Plexport only receives two flights a week, Mandy spends her time tinkering with electronics or getting into mischief. She later becomes a deputy to Flagg. *Jules \\"Deathwish\\" Folquet, captain of the Skokie Skullcrushers basketball team. Despite his punk appearance, his hulking size and the extreme nature of the sport he plays, Jules is quite intelligent.

Retrieved on August 10, 2013. was a Confederate soldier executed by Union forces in Pulaski, Tennessee, during the American Civil War. He is popularly known as the Boy Hero of the Confederacy although he was 21 when he died and became a celebrated instance of Confederate memorialisation in the late 1890s and early 1900s eulogised by Middle Tennesseans for his valor and sacrifice. ==Early life== Born October 6, 1842, in Rutherford County, Tennessee, he was the oldest son of Charles Lewis Davis and Jane (Simmons) Davis. At the peak period of the 1850s, records show the Davis Plantation had more than 50 slaves.http://www.cannoncourier.com/slaves-story-disclosed-at-sam-davis-home- cms-11892 He attended local school in Smyrna, Tennessee, and was educated at the Western Military Institute‚Äînow Montgomery Bell Academy‚Äîfrom 1860‚Äì61. While there he came under the influence of headmaster and future Confederate General Bushrod Johnson. He was recruited by Confederate scout forces early in the Civil War. He signed up as a private in the 1st Tennessee Infantry Regiment in 1861 and his regiment marched off to war first at Cheat Mountain, next in the Shenandoah Valley, then at Shiloh and Perryville. Wounded slightly at Shiloh, Davis suffered a more severe wound at Perryville. After recovering from the later wound he took on very active service as a courier for Coleman's Scouts. ==Capture and trial== He was captured near Minor Hill, Tennessee, on November 20, 1863, having been detailed for special, hazardous duty within the Union lines of occupation around Nashville. At the time of his arrest by Union secret service agents, Davis had in his possession a miscellany of newspapers and intelligence sources, which included detailed drawings of Union fortifications at Nashville and other towns in Middle Tennessee. Imprisoned in Pulaski, which at that time was a garrisoned Union town under command of General Grenville M. Dodge, Davis faced charges of espionage and steadfastly refused to reveal the names of his informants. After his prisoner was found guilty, General Dodge announced that Davis should be hanged on a hill described by a report from the Cincinnati Daily Commercial as \\"a pretty eminence, north east of Pulaski, and overlooking the town.\\" When local citizens protested at so visual a display of a gruesome act, Dodge allegedly replied, \\"I want him hung where you all can see him.\\" According to the newspaper account, which is corroborated by several eyewitness accounts recorded between 1862 and the 1890s, Dodge offered Davis his life in exchange for information about his informants. The condemned man apparently refused all such offers. \\"Would you betray a friend?\\" Davis is reported to have said while seated on his coffin. \\"I had rather die a thousand deaths.\\" Confederate lore had Davis saying upon climbing the scaffold that \\"the boys will have to fight the battles without me.\\" == Execution == Accounts of Davis' death appeared in accounts written by Union soldiers, who witnessed the execution, and by a journalist from the Cincinnati Daily Commercial. Bearing his fate bravely, Davis apparently touched upon the sympathies of all observers, including his captors. The reporter recorded the scene thus: After a white hood was tied over the prisoner's head, the trap door was sprung at 10:30 a.m. Union soldiers turned away as Davis writhed in death agony for three minutes. \\"He stood it like a man,\\" one Union soldier noted in his diary the following day. \\"He never paled a bit but stood it like a hero.\\" That night, the Daily Commercial reported, \\"evergreens were planted, and now sigh in the wild wintery winds o'er his grave, while flowers culled by fair hands, were strewn upon it.\\"Cincinnati Daily Commercial, 8 December 1863; J.C. Harwood Diary, 1863-1864, Tennessee State Library and Archives; Captain H. I Smith, \\"Union Veteran's Tribute to Davis,\\" Confederate Veteran 3 (December 1895); \\"Letter from Gen. Dodge,\\" Confederate Veteran 5 (July 1897); \\"The Sam Davis Overcoat,\\" Confederate Veteran 5 (July 1897); John Bakeless, Spies of the Confederacy (1970; rprt. Dover Publications, 1997), 205-42. Davis wrote a letter to his mother before his execution, \\"Dear mother. O how painful it is to write you! I have got to die to-morrow --- to be hanged by the Federals. Mother, do not grieve for me. I must bid you good-bye forevermore. Mother, I do not fear to die. Give my love to all.\\" There was a postscript for his father, too. \\"Father, you can send after my remains if you want to do so. They will be at Pulaski, Tenn. I will leave some things with the hotel keeper for you.\\" He was hanged by Union forces in Pulaski, Tennessee, on November 27, 1863. As he was trundled along to the hanging site atop his own coffin, Union soldiers alongside the bumpy wagon road shouted out their entreaties for his cooperation, lest they have to watch the grim execution. Supposedly the officer in charge of the execution was discomfited by Davis' youth and calm demeanor and had trouble carrying out his orders. Davis is alleged to have said to him, \\"Officer, I did my duty. Now, you do yours.\\" The execution gained some notoriety at the time, especially among soldiers of the Army of Tennessee. Writing in his memoir _Co. Aytch,_ published in the early 1880s, Private Sam Watkins recalled that in 1864 that his regiment had assembled to watch the hanging of two young Yankee spies, eager to see the condemned men suffer because \\"they had hung one of our regiment at Pulaski -- Sam Davis.\\" == To rescue from oblivion == Sam Davis' execution was not that unusual an event. Davis suffered a fate shared by many intelligence gatherers operating around Nashville. Most of the rural counties surrounding Nashville were only nominally under Union control, and this 'no-man's land' witnessed over three years of bloody internecine conflict and the steady dissolution of the institution of slavery. In this context, execution for espionage was not uncommon. The Provost Marshal records for Middle Tennessee offer evidence of scores of execution on espionage charges, with not all the victims receiving trials (as Davis did). Six months before Davis's execution, Union commanders publicly executed Joseph Smith in Carthage, a rural town east of Nashville. As was the case with Davis, some of these events generated newspaper coverage and featured in private letters. Most executions, however, went unrecorded apart from a perfunctory note in the Provost Marshal's records. Today, all of these men are forgotten - except for Sam Davis.Harcourt, \\"The Making of Sam Davis.\\" . For nearly thirty years after the war, the story of Sam Davis's execution was not widely remembered. In 1866 Davis's father erected the first monument to his son, a twenty-five foot shaft of Italian marble, at the back of the family's plantation home outside Smyrna. The Sam Davis story became part of a broader social memory only in the mid-1890s and chiefly through the efforts of Sumner Archibald Cunningham, the founding editor of Confederate Veteran magazine. A native of Middle Tennessee, Cunningham had an undistinguished record of Confederate service, having deserted the Army of Tennessee after the Battle of Nashville in 1864. After the war he worked as a newspaperman before becoming the general agent for the Jefferson Davis Memorial Fund after the former Confederate president's death in 1889. He left this position shortly after launching the Nashville-based Confederate Veteran in January 1893. The Sam Davis Statue. Before he founded the Confederate Veteran Cunningham had never heard of Sam Davis. When an early subscriber to the magazine submitted a school oration about Davis for publication, Cunningham rejected it, \\"feeling that there were so many equally worthy heroes it would hardly be fair to print this special eulogy.\\" But at a Blue-Gray veterans reunion in April 1895, on the battlefield at Shiloh, Cunningham again heard about the story of Davis's execution - and this time from two federal veterans, witnesses to the execution, who claimed, as Cunningham phrased it, that \\"the Federal Army was in grief over it.\\" These accounts struck a chord and convinced Cunningham of the merits of publicizing the story. The Union veterans' story of an ordinary soldier's heroic death, couched in the language of reconciliation, fit perfectly with the spirit of the times and the viewpoint of the Confederate Veteran. \\"I resolved to print the story,\\" Cunningham recalled in 1899, \\"and [to] reprint it until that typical hero should have as full credit as the Veteran could give him.\\" As Cunningham assumed stewardship of the Sam Davis story he transformed oral memories into a broad collective memory through a series of promotions. First, he solicited written versions of the federal eyewitness accounts of Davis's execution that he had heard at the Shiloh reunion and then published them in the Veteran. Next, Cunningham called for Tennesseans to come forward with \\"such data as may be recalled by all who know anything of the event.\\" Sensing an opportunity to galvanize interest in his fledgling publication, Cunningham threw his energies into sponsorship of the Sam Davis story. In a series of editorials published in the summer of 1895, Cunningham packaged Davis's sacrifice in Christian terms, insisting that the story recalled \\"the sacrifice of the Galilean whose hands and feet were nailed to a cross.\\" By summer's end, Cunningham launched a fundraising drive for a monument to Davis's memory to be erected on the Tennessee State Capitol grounds in Nashville. ==Legacy== Sam Davis House in Smyrna, Tennessee Since the late 1890s, Davis has towered above any other Tennessean in the pantheon of Confederate Civil War heroes. Today, representations of the life and death of Sam Davis mark the historical and geographical landscapes of the Middle Tennessee heartland. Monuments commemorating him stand at the scene of his execution and on the court square in Pulaski; at his childhood home outside Smyrna, Tennessee; and in the form of a life-size statue positioned prominently on the southeast corner of the state capitol grounds in Nashville. An exhibition case of Sam Davis artifacts‚Äîincluding the overcoat worn at the time of his arrest and the boot in which papers were concealed‚Äîis on permanent display at the Tennessee State Museum. Over the years, archivists at the Tennessee State Library and Archives have procured and catalogued scores of documents: firsthand recollections, poems, commemorative speeches, at least four published biographies, and the papers of the Sam Davis Memorial Association. Each year, thousands of visitors including many schoolchildren visit the Sam Davis House outside Smyrna, which for over eighty years has been operated as a private nonprofit by the Sam Davis Memorial Association. The Sons of Confederate Veterans posthumously awarded Davis their Confederate Medal of Honor, created in 1977. == Controversy == Sam Davis's youth and the manner of his death has meant that the statue in his memory within the grounds of the Tennessee State Capitol has drawn little of the criticism and protest that in recent times has been targeted on Confederate statues. In 1999, however, the Black Caucus of Tennessee state legislators erected a monument within fifteen feet of the Davis statue to the victims of the Middle Passage who died en route to slavery in the Americas. This drew protests from the Sons of Confederate Veterans who called the proximate placement of the monument to the Davis statue \\"a foolish little sophomoric prank.\\" A spokesperson for the Black Caucus claimed no intent \\"to disrespect a Confederate soldier or have it overshadow him in any way\\" adding that the location for the monument to slavery's victims within the State Capitol grounds was determined by horticultural factors alone.\\"Monument's Placement Upsets Some,\\" _Tennessean_ , 21 July 1999 - quoted in Harcourt, op cit. In 1992 the Sam Davis Memorial Association, who manage the Sam Davis Home on behalf of the State of Tennessee, were inundated with complaints from Confederate supporters angered by the rumor that the battle flag of the Confederacy no longer flew at the Sam Davis Home. The Association responded by saying that \\"the only trouble we have is trying to satisfy different demands over which Confederate flag should be flown on a regular basis. At the present time, in an attempt to please as many of our supporters as possible, the several Confederate flags are flown on a rotating basis; but a Confederate flag is always flown.\\"Harcourt, \\"The Making of Sam Davis,\\" 50-51. In the early 2000s historical archaeologists at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) criticised the \\"shrine mentality\\" and cited a lack of authenticity in the material culture and historical interpretation at the Sam Davis Home. The custodians of the home complained about policy changes that were inconsistent with the original purpose of the home - including the flying of the U.S. flag, which the Nashville chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy called \\"an insult, not only to Sam Davis and his Family, but to the entire Confederacy and its descendants.\\"Harcourt, \\"The Making of Sam Davis,\\" 49. In recent years the Sam Davis Home has started to run educational programs focused on the material culture of the mid- nineteenth century, Civil War medicine, the music of slaves, and the lives of soldiers and civilians during the Civil War. In 2020, following the killing of George Floyd and subsequent protests, Montgomery Bell Academy removed their statue of Sam Davis from the campus, citing Davis's association with the Confederacy and the perception that the statue supported racism. ==Notes== ==Further reading== * Edward John Harcourt, \\"The Boys Will Have to Fight the Battles without Me\\": The Making of Sam Davis, \\"Boy Hero of the Confederacy\\" _Southern Cultures_ Fall 2006: 29-54. * Franklin Forts, \\"Living with Confederate Symbols,\\" _Southern Cultures_ Spring 2002: 60-75. * Beverly A.

The hangars can be seen in the distance. The Control Tower before refurbishment Royal Air Force Greenham Common or RAF Greenham Common is a former Royal Air Force station in Berkshire, England. The airfield was southeast of Newbury, Berkshire, about west of London. Opened in 1942, it was used by both the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces during the Second World War and the United States Air Force during the Cold War, also as a base for nuclear weapons. After the Cold War ended, it was closed in September 1992. The airfield was also known for the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp held outside its gates in the 1980s in protest against the stationing of cruise missiles on the base. In 1997 Greenham Common was designated as public parkland, effectively returning it to its pre-WW2 status but with restrictions. Greenham and Crookham Commons became a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The Cold War era control tower has recently been redeveloped and is now open as a visitor centre with a historical exhibition and community cafe. Cattle from local farms are permitted to graze the Common and often stray onto the adjacent Burys Bank Road. ==Second World War== Before the building of an airfield, Greenham Common was a massive piece of common land. It was used for troop movements during the English Civil War and in the eighteen and nineteenth centuries. In late 1943, Greenham Common airfield was turned over to the USAAF Ninth Air Force. An American advance party soon arrived to ready the airfield for the incoming units. Greenham Common was known as USAAF Station AAF-486 for security reasons by the USAAF during the war, and it was referred to by this name instead of by location. Its USAAF Station Code was \\"GC\\". The first arrival was the 51st Troop Carrier Wing Headquarters, arriving in September 1942. The 51st TCW controlled the three troop carrier groups at RAF Keevil (62nd TCG), RAF Aldermaston (60th TCG) and RAF Ramsbury (64th TCG) as part of Twelfth Air Force. The Wing Headquarters was located in requisitioned Bowdown House, a mansion on the northeast end of the airfield, and made use of the runways for its communication and courier flights. The 51st TCW HQ followed its groups to North Africa as part of Operation Torch in November 1942. ===354th Fighter Group=== North American P-51B-1-NA Mustang, AAF Ser. No. 43-12408 of the 355th Fighter Squadron Republic P-47D of the 397th Fighter Squadron As troop carrier groups began arriving in the UK in late 1943 and deployed in the Greenham area, Greenham Common was one of the airfields used by the Ninth Air Force for fighter groups arriving from the United States. On 4 November the 354th Fighter Group arrived from Portland Army Air Field, Oregon and they were informed they were to fly the North American P-51 Mustang. This was a change of equipment for the group, as they had trained with Bell P-39 Airacobras. The group stayed at Greenham Common for only a few days, being transferred to RAF Boxted in Essex on 13 November. ===368th Fighter Group=== A few weeks later on 13 January 1944, the 368th Fighter Group arrived from Farmingdale, New York, flying Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. They had the following fighter squadrons and fuselage codes: * 395th Fighter Squadron (A7) * 396th Fighter Squadron (C2) * 397th Fighter Squadron (D3) The 368th was a group of Ninth Air Force's 71st Fighter Wing, IX Tactical Air Command. The 368th FG moved to RAF Chilbolton the next day. === 438th Troop Carrier Group === General Dwight D. Eisenhower addresses Company E, 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment (Strike), at Greenham Common Airfield about 8:30 pm on 5 June 1944. C-47 of the 89th Troop Carrier Squadron C-47 of the 88th Troop Carrier Squadron Literally as the 368th FG was moving out, the 438th Troop Carrier Group was flying into Greenham Common from RAF Langar. Flying Douglas C-47 Skytrains, they had the following Troop Carrier squadrons and fuselage codes: * 87th Troop Carrier Squadron (3X) * 88th Troop Carrier Squadron (M2) * 89th Troop Carrier Squadron (4U) * 90th Troop Carrier Squadron (Q7) The 438th was a group of Ninth Air Force's 53rd Troop Carrier Wing of IX Troop Carrier Command. The 90th TCS stayed in the UK and operated from RAF Welford until the rest of the groups aircraft returned from Italy on 24 August. In the absence of the 438th, the 316th Troop Carrier Group used Greenham Common as a forward base. The airfield was inactive for the next five years, and would probably have remained so but for the sudden escalation in tension between the Soviet Union and its Second World War Allies in what later became known as the Cold War. ==Cold War== After the 1948 Berlin Blockade and the 1950 invasion of South Korea by the Korean People's Army, the perceived threat from the Soviet Union rose. On 23 April 1951, RAF Greenham Common was made available to the United States Air Force by the British Ministry of Defence as a Strategic Air Command base, with joint operations with the Royal Air Force units. Formal handover to the 7th Air Division was on 18 June and massive reconstruction work began. Basically, the entire wartime airfield was demolished and replaced with a new 10,000 ft (3048 m) east‚Äìwest runway with parallel taxiways north and south of it leading to extensive hardstandings. A new technical and domestic site was built to the south of the runway, involving diversion of the A339 road and demolition of several homes and two pubs. Construction work was finally completed and the base declared operational in September 1953. ===Strategic Air Command=== Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter, 1951 B-47E-50-LM Stratojet, AF Ser. No. 52-3363, in flight. B-58 Hustler in flight In the post-Second World War years, the United States Strategic Air Command was based at three major airfields in eastern England: RAF Lakenheath, RAF Marham and RAF Sculthorpe. The increasing tension of the Cold War led to a re-evaluation of these deployments and a move further west, behind RAF fighter forces, to RAF Greenham Common, RAF Brize Norton, RAF Upper Heyford and RAF Fairford. The airfield came under Strategic Air Command's 7th Air Division, with the 3909th Combat Support Group as its administrative unit on the base, responsible for all non-flying activities as well as maintenance and logistical support of the flying units attached to RAF Greenham Common. The initial bomber wing deployed was the 303d Bombardment Wing with B-47 Stratojets, arriving on 17 March 1954 from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. The 303d stayed just over a month, returning on 28 April 1954. This was the first of the short-term temporary duty deployments from home bases in the US that continued intermittently over the next 10 years. Other known SAC deployments were: *Greenham Common Task Force (Provisional) (1 November 1955 ‚Äì UNK) (ERB-29Aa and RB-50G/Es) (Electronic Reconnaissance and Countermeasures) (TDY From 97th Bombardment Wing, Schilling AFB, Kansas) * 97th Air Refueling Squadron (5 May 1956 ‚Äì 13 July 1956)(KC-97) (TDY From 97th Bombardment Wing, Schilling AFB, Kansas) *310th Bombardment Wing (3 October 1956 ‚Äì 9 January 1957) (B-47, KC-97) (TDY Smokey Hill AFB, later renamed Schilling AFB, Kansas) *40th Bombardment Wing (1 July 1957 ‚Äì 1 October 1957) (B-47, KC-97) (TDY Schilling AFB, Kansas) In April 1958 the 90-day detachments were replaced by a three-week Reflex Alert rotation, during which the bombers did not fly, reducing the noise considerably. The runways and dispersals were further strengthened for the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber, but none were based at Greenham. From August 1960 the B-52 made periodic training visits, and a Convair B-58 Hustler arrived briefly in October 1963. Reflex operations by B-47 and KC-97s continued until 1 April 1964. The Strategic Air Command (SAC) departed Greenham Common on 30 June 1964, much to the relief of the local residents; the thundering jet bombers of SAC came no more, and for several years it was used for USAF storage and as a relief base. ===United States Air Forces in Europe=== Gate to RAF Greenham Common, 1961. The closure of US bases in France forced the reopening of RAF Greenham Common for air transport operations (Operation FRELOC) to handle materiel and personnel overflow beginning in early January 1967. In late 1967, Greenham Common was used for NATO Exercise REFORGER, again as a result of the withdrawal of France from the NATO integrated military alliance. On 1 November 1968 control of RAF Greenham Common was transferred from SAC to the United States Air Forces in Europe, with the 7551st Combat Support Group having administrative control of the base. However, the base was little used, primarily being utilised as a United States Military Postal Mail sorting facility, with aircraft flying mail in from the United States, being sorted at Greenham Common, then distributed to American bases in the UK and Europe. Mail from American forces in Europe was also sent to Greenham Common and sorted there, before being flown to the United States. Beginning in 1973 the base became the home of the International Air Tattoo, a large scale international military airshow, since relocated to RAF Fairford, approximately away. The 20th Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Upper Heyford established \\"Operating Location A\\" at Greenham Common for its F-111 fighters in 1976, using the airfield occasionally for dispersal exercises. In 1977 the USAF announced plans to reactivate the base to house KC-135 aerial refueling tanker aircraft, due to a lack of capacity at the KC-135's main base in Britain, RAF Mildenhall. This led to widespread local opposition, and in 1978 the British Defence Secretary vetoed the plan. ===501st Tactical Missile Wing=== Greenham Common in the late 80s The Soviet deployment of the SS-20 missile from 1975 caused major concern in the NATO alliance. The longer range, greater accuracy, mobility and striking power of the new missile was perceived to alter the security of Western Europe. It was feared that the Soviet Union could launch a nuclear strike against Western Europe with a reduced threat of nuclear retaliation (i.e. compared to an attack on the continental United States). After discussions, NATO agreed to a two part strategy: * To pursue arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union to reduce the Soviet and American INF arsenals. * To deploy in Europe from 1983 up to 464 USAF BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missiles or GLCMs, as well as 108 US Army Pershing II ballistic missiles. (See also SLCM and ALCM). The UK's share of this total was 160 missiles, 96 based at Greenham Common with four spares, and 64 at RAF Molesworth. When in June 1980 it was announced that RAF Greenham Common was to become the first site for cruise missiles, there was an outcry from the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Once more a massive new construction was undertaken as the GLCM Alert and Maintenance Area (GAMA) site was built in the southwest corner of the base. GAMA was a maximum security QRA (Quick Reaction Alert) area with 6 large above ground shelters in which fully operational cruise missiles were stored. The GAMA site These shelters were specially designed and constructed to protect the GLCMs and crews against nuclear and conventional strikes. They were about 10 m high, with a reinforced 2 m thick concrete ceiling. Below was a massive titanium plate, 3 m of sand and a reinforced concrete plate. The shelters were completely covered with tons of clay. Each shelter was equipped with three hydraulic nuclear blast proof doors at both ends to assure a quick entry or exit. They were designed to withstand the blast of an air-bursting nuclear explosion above the base or a direct hit from a conventional bomb. Each shelter contained 2 LCC Launch Control Centers and 4 TEL transporter erector launchers. Units were mobile and, once deployed, would travel from the base in convoys to secret preset dispersal sites. This would happen within minutes of the alert being given; movement was via local roads through the surrounding villages. The first squadron of the 501st Tactical Missile Wing received its weapons in November 1983; they were flown onto the base by Lockheed C-5 Galaxys. A series of meetings held during August and September 1986 culminated in a summit between United States President Ronald Reagan and the General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, on 11 October 1986. To the surprise of both men's advisers, the two agreed in principle to removing INF systems from Europe and to equal global limits of 100 INF missile warheads. The United States and the Soviet Union signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987, which led to the removal of all nuclear missiles from the base. The last GLCMs at RAF Greenham Common were removed in March 1991, and the 501st TMW inactivated on 4 June 1991. The base's last operational commander, Group Captain Andrew Brookes, RAF went on to become an aviation author and defence academic. ===Greenham Common Peace Camp=== On 12 December 1982, 30,000 women held hands around the perimeter of the base, in protest against the decision to site American cruise missiles there From 1981 \\"women's peace camps\\" were established in protest at the deployment of cruise missiles. They came to be known as \\"The Greenham Women\\" or \\"peace women\\", and their 19-year protest drew worldwide media and public attention, often due to the peace women cutting through the fences of the base. ===USAF departure and closure=== Entrance to the New Greenham Park On 11 September 1992, the USAF returned RAF Greenham Common to the Ministry of Defence. On 9 February 1993 the Greenham Common air base was declared surplus to requirements by the Secretary of State for Defence and the facility was closed and put up for sale. Aerial view of the former runway at RAF Greenham Common, viewed east-to-west, August 2014. With the departure of the cruise missiles and the subsequent closure of the base by the MOD in 1993, the peace camps remained at the site until September 2000 to ensure the base was closed and the land returned to the public. However, the protesters no longer attracted the attention of the media as they did during the 1980s when there were some 40 camps spread around the base perimeter. ==Alleged nuclear accident== On 28 February 1958, a B-47E of the 310th Bomb Wing developed problems shortly after takeoff and jettisoned its two 1,700 gallon external fuel tanks. They missed their designated safe impact area, and one hit a hangar while the other struck the ground behind a parked B-47E. The parked plane, which was fuelled, had a pilot on board, and was carrying a 1.1 megaton (4.6 PJ) B28 nuclear bomb, was engulfed by flames. The conflagration took sixteen hours and over a million gallons of water to extinguish, partly because of the magnesium alloys used in the aircraft. Although two men were killed and eight injured, the US and UK governments kept the accident secret: as late as 1985, the British government claimed that a taxiing aircraft had struck a parked one and that no fire was involved. Two scientists, F. H. Cripps and A. Stimson, who both worked for the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston, stated in a secret 1961 report, released by the CND in 1996, that the fire detonated the high explosives in the nuclear weapon, that plutonium and uranium oxides were spread over a wide area (foliage up to 8 mi (13 km) away was contaminated with uranium-235) and that they had discovered high concentrations of radioactive contamination around the air base.The Distribution of Uranium 235 and Plutonium 239 around the United States Airforce base at Greenham Common, July 1961 by F H Cripps & A Stimson, AWRE, Aldermaston However, a radiological survey commissioned in 1997 by Newbury District Council and Basingstoke and Deane found no evidence of a nuclear accident at Greenham Common, suggesting that Cripps and Stimson's statements were false. The seven-month long survey was carried out by the Geosciences Advisory Unit of Southampton University and combined a helicopter- mounted gamma ray detector survey with a ground-based survey. The team analysed nearly 600 samples taken from soil, lake sediment, borehole water, house dust, runway tarmac and concrete, looking for uranium and plutonium isotopes. No evidence of an accident involving nuclear weapons damage was found at the former air force base although the ground survey detected some low-level uranium contamination around the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston thought to be derived from that facility, and the helicopter survey found some anomalies around Harwell Laboratory.Greenham Common given 'all-clear'-leaving childhood leukaemia clusters a mystery , Southampton University in-house newsletter New Reporter Vol 14, No 12, 10 March 1997 ==In popular culture== The airfield was used In the sixth series of London's Burning where the production team built a petrol garage and diner to be used in a large incident in episode 7. An episode of BBC's Top Gear was filmed at the abandoned airfield, with Jeremy Clarkson and James May attempting to find out if communism had produced a good car. Beyonc√© used the airfield to film scenes for her 2013 self-titled visual album. In the 1996 video game, Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars, Lady Piermont mentions Greenham Common after helping George Stobbart get the Templar manuscript. The control tower after refurbishment Greenham Common airfield was used as a filming location for the 2015 film Star Wars: The Force Awakens and 2017 film Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The GAMA area was used as the location for the above ground Resistance base on the fictional planet D'Qar. Greenham Common airfield was also used as a filming location for the 2019 film Fast and Furious 9 ==See also== *List of former Royal Air Force stations ==Notes== ===Bibliography=== * Fletcher, Harry R.

Renal thresholds vary by substance ‚Äì the low potency poison urea, for instance, is removed at much lower concentrations than glucose. Indeed, the most common reason for the glucose renal threshold ever being exceeded is diabetes, which is called glycosuria. Renal thresholds vary by species and by physiological condition; thus an animal may have different renal thresholds while hibernating, Renal thresholds can also be altered by many drugs, and may change in characteristic ways during certain illnesses. Taken together, the collection of a kidney's renal thresholds essentially define much of its function in renal physiology.

The figure has been represented in the comics by three different individuals, Charles McNider, Beth Chapel, and Pieter Anton Cross. Dr. Mid-Nite was originally created by writer Charles Reizenstein and artist Stanley Josephs Aschmeier in 1941. The hero, represented first by Charles McNider, appeared for the first time in All-American Comics #25 (April 1941). He continued in All-American Comics until issue #102 (Oct 1948). Like many Golden Age heroic characters, the original Doctor Mid-Nite appeared as a member of DC's Justice Society of America. His two successors were also represented as members of the group or an offshoot. Doctor Mid-Nite has never appeared as the solo protagonist of a regular title magazine, but the figure has been the subject of an anthology and a mini-series. All three versions of Doctor Mid-Nite have exhibited the same basic features: a cowled costume featuring a crescent moon symbol, keen ability to see in the darkness at the cost of near or total blindness in sunlight, the use of special visors and ‚Äúblackout‚Äù smoke bombs to gain tactical advantage in combat, a high degree of skill in martial arts, and jobs as physicians serving both normal human beings and \\"metahuman\\" superheroes. Additionally, two of the doctors have been accompanied by sidekick owls. As a blind character, Doctor Mid-Nite is widely regarded as the first superhero in comics to exhibit a physical impairment, pre-dating the creation of Daredevil of Marvel Comics by more than twenty years. Charles McNider made his live-action debut in the second season of DC's Legends of Tomorrow played by Kwesi Ameyaw. Charles McNider also appears in the DC Universe series Stargirl, portrayed by Henry Thomas, alongside Beth Chapel, portrayed by Anjelika Washington. ==Fictional character biographies== ===Charles McNider=== Charles McNider is the original Doctor Mid-Nite appearing in All American Comics #25 (April 1941) in the Golden Age of Comic Books and is a common member of the Justice Society of America. McNider, a young surgeon, was blinded when a grenade went off in front of him caused by gangster \\"Killer\\" Maroni, but he found that he could see in the dark. He made special goggles that allowed him to see in the daylight, and decided to use his special power to fight crime. In his civilian identity, he pretends to be a helpless blind man. ===Beth Chapel=== Beth Chapel as Doctor Midnight. Art by Todd MacFarlane. As the aging McNider spent less time in action, Beth Chapel, a medical doctor, stepped into the role of Doctor Midnight. Beth Chapel was a native of Orangeburg, South Carolina, with a pastor father, a mother who sang in the church choir, and four brothers.Infinity Inc. #21. DC Comics. Chapel first appeared when Jade of Infinity, Inc. was rushed to her hospital for treatment after encountering Mister Bones' cyanide touch. During the onset of the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Beth was blinded by an oxygen explosion, only to be rescued by Hourman's son Rick Tyler, who had taken McNider's drug that enhances ability to see in the dark. Beth used the formula to similarly treat her blindness, and she and Rick assume the mantles of their predecessors as Doctor Midnight and Hourman, with her mother crafting a super hero costume from a choir robe. Along with a new Wildcat, Chapel and Tyler applied for membership in Infinity, Inc, eventually gaining admission; however, the association was short-lived, as Infinity, Inc. disbanded shortly thereafter, though Chapel and Tyler began a romantic relationship during their tenure. Doctor Midnight and Wildcat were subsequently recruited by the U.S. government for a mission to defeat the supervillain Eclipso, only for Chapel to die on the mission along with Wildcat, the Creeper, Commander Steel, Peacemaker, and Major Victory.Eclipso #13. DC Comics. During the events of the \\"Watchmen\\" sequel \\"Doomsday Clock\\", Beth Chapel was returned to life alongside the rest of the restored Justice Society of America and the Legion of Super-Heroes thanks to the influence of Doctor Manhattan. She now sports a more traditional costume resembling that of McNider and Cross. Following the fight against Black Adam's group and the foreign superheroes, Doctor Mid-Nite is mentioned to have opened a metahuman medical clinic called the All-Star Clinic where Ronnie Raymond is receiving treatment.Doomsday Clock #12 (December 2019). DC Comics. ===Pieter Cross=== Pieter Cross first appeared in Doctor Mid-Nite #1. He is a doctor who develops the same abilities as Charles McNider after being drugged by enforcers from Praeda Industries and being in a car accident. ==Owls of Doctor Mid-Nite== Both Charles McNider and Pieter Anton Cross train owls as sidekicks. McNider trains the same owl which crashes through his window, an event that leads to the discovery of his powers. This owl named \\"Hooty\\" (sometimes \\"Hootie\\") shares many adventures during the Golden Age. Cross keeps company with an owl named \\"Charlie\\". The bird is named after the original Doctor Mid-Nite Charles McNider. Charlie keeps a mini-camera around his neck that can feed video directly to a display in Cross's goggles. ==Enemies== Each incarnation of Doctor Mid-Nite has fought different enemies: * \\"Gallows\\" Gallagher - A gangster who had his brother take his place in prison with help from a corrupt prison warden.All-American Comics #27. DC Comics. * \\"Hands\\" Hannigan - A gangster who wanted to take advantage of Regis Morgan's telescopic vision and make him a lookout for his gang.All-American Comics #76.

DC Comics. * Terrible Trio - The members in the aliases of Fisk, Shackley, and Volper run Praeda Industries.Doctor Mid-Nite #1-3. DC Comics. ==Other versions== In 1965, DC Comics had no plans to revive Doctor Mid-Nite. DC editor Julius Schwartz gave M.I.T. student and comic book letterhack Rick Norwood permission to publish a Dr. Midnight story in his fanzine, Five. The story written by Norwood and illustrated by Steve Sabo features a doctor named Tom Benson who is blinded in battle. He discovers that his other senses are super-sensitive and dons the Doctor Midnight costume to fight crime. Another version of the character was shown in Dan Jolley and Tony Harris' JSA: The Liberty File as a World War II United States intelligence agent code-named the Owl. This character, though a playboy, resembles other Doctor Mid-Nite representations. Though derided for his dalliances with the ladies, McNider was trusted as a valued field operative. In the Tangent: Superman's Reign series, a version of Doctor Mid-Nite his body completely covered by a black cloak is briefly seen. In the new Earth-2 created in the wake of Infinite Crisis and 52, a version of Beth Chapel is shown to be a member of the Justice Society Infinity.Justice Society of America Annual #1 ==In other media== ===Television=== ====Live- action==== * Doctor Mid-Nite appears in the Smallville episode \\"Absolute Justice\\", in the painting depicting the Justice Society of America. * The Charles McNider incarnation of Doctor Mid-Nite appears in The CW's Arrowverse series Legends of Tomorrows second season as a member of a 1940s incarnation of the JSA, portrayed by Kwesi Ameyaw. This version is legally blind, but possesses the metahuman ability to see perfectly in the dark. According to his former teammate Obsidian, he was presumed dead after going missing on a mission in 1956. However, the Legends later learned that he was placed in the distant future of 3000, where he used futuristic tech to restore his eyesight. He was later murdered by a brainwashed Rip Hunter as he was protecting a fragment of the Spear of Destiny. * Both Charles McNider and Beth Chapel appear in the DC Universe series Stargirl, portrayed by Henry Thomas and Anjelika Washington respectively. In the pilot episode, McNider was killed along with the JSA by the Injustice Society, his uniform being put up as a memorial in his honor. Beth is shown to be a socially awkward girl who has not made any friends like her mother encourages her to do. In the episode \\"Hourman and Dr. Mid-Nite\\", she becomes the new Doctor Mid-Nite and helps Rick Tyler learn his parents were killed in a car accident caused by Injustice Society member Solomon Grundy. ** Ahead of the series' premiere, Beth made a cameo appearance in the Arrowverse crossover event, \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\". ====Animation==== * The Charles McNider version of Doctor Mid-Nite makes several brief appearances without dialogue in Justice League Unlimited, most notably in the episodes \\"Dark Heart\\", \\"Divided We Fall\\", and \\"Destroyer\\" (where he was highlighted along with fellow JSA members Doctor Fate, Hourman, and Wildcat). * The Charles McNider version of Doctor Mid-Nite appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episodes \\"The Golden Age of Justice\\" and \\"Crisis 23,000 Miles Above the Earth\\", voiced by Corey Burton. He is shown as a member of the Justice Society of America and the team's resident doctor. * In the Young Justice episode \\"Coldhearted\\", Pieter Cross (voiced by Bruce Greenwood) appears as a surgeon who performs a heart transplant on Count Vertigo's niece Perdita. He is never named onscreen, but is identified in the credits. He later appears in the second-season episode \\"True Colors\\" assisting Ray Palmer and Bumblebee in attempting to remove the Blue Beetle scarab from Jaime Reyes following the discovery of its connection to the Reach. * Doctor Mid-Nite appears in episode 46 of Mad, voiced by Kevin Shinick. In the \\"That's What Super Friends Are For\\" segment, Doctor Mid-Nite joins the other superheroes into asking Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman about being called \\"Super Friends.\\" Doctor Mid-Nite's part has him mentioning how he once asked Batman to take him to the airport, but Batman answered that it was \\"best to take a cab.\\" ===Film=== * Dr. Mid-Nite also appears as a member of the Justice Society of America in the animated film Justice League: The New Frontier. He can be seen in a cameo at the opening credits of the film. ===Toys=== * Dr. Mid-Nite was featured as an action figure in the twelfth wave of the DC Universe Classics line. His accessory was his owl, Hooty, who rested on his arm. * Mattel released an action figure of the Justice League Unlimited version of Dr. Mid-Nite in its DC Universe: Justice League Unlimited Fan Collection line in November 2011. * DC Direct released two action figures of Dr. Mid-Nite (Charles McNider and Peter Cross). The Charles McNider version was released in 2001 and had exchangeable right wrists. One wrist came with Dr. Mid-Nite's pet owl, Hooty. ==References== ==External links== * JSA Fact File: Doctor Mid-Nite I * Doctor Mid-Nite at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

He was editor of The Guardian for twenty years, from 1975 to 1995. ==Early life== Peter Preston was born in Barrow upon Soar, Leicestershire, the son of John Preston, a greengrocery business manager, and his wife, Kathlyn Preston (n√©e Chell). He grew up in the village of Quorn, two miles south of Loughborough. His father died from polio when he was child, and he subsequently caught the disease; he spent 18 months in and out of hospital, including time in an iron lung. The disease caused permanent damage to his body. He was educated at Loughborough Grammar School and St John's College, Oxford, where he edited the student paper Cherwell. ==Career== Preston started his career at the Liverpool Daily Post in 1959, and joined The Guardian (then the Manchester Guardian) in 1963. He rose to become editor in 1975 and remained so for over twenty years, retiring in 1995. He reported on Conservative MPs, including the perjurious Jonathan Aitken and the cash-for- questions affair involving Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith. In both instances, a source was Harrod's and Paris Ritz owner Mohammed Al-Fayed. Preston was also editor when The Guardian was forced to hand over leaked government documents which were then traced to a Foreign Office copier, leading to Sarah Tisdall, who was subsequently imprisoned under the Official Secrets Act 1911. He continued as a columnist for the rest of his life. He contributed a weekly column to The Observer, \\"Peter Preston on press and broadcasting\\", devoted mainly to news about newspapers, their readers and (generally) diminishing circulations in the newspaper's \\"business and media\\" section. He was one of the founders of the European Press Prize and acted as chairman of its preparatory committee from 2013 until 2017. He was a member of the Scott Trust (owner of The Guardian and Observer) from 1979 to 2003, chairman of the International Press Institute from 1995 to 1997, and chairman of the Association of British Press Editors. Preston wrote two novels, Bess and 51st State. ==Personal life and honours== In 1962, Preston married Jean Burrell, and they had four children. His son, Ben Preston, is a former deputy editor of The TimesStephen Brook \\"Former deputy editor [Ben Preston leaves Times\\"], The Times, 4 February 2008 and Radio Times, and is executive editor of The Sunday Times. He received honorary degrees from the City University, London and the universities of Leicester, Loughborough, Essex and Roehampton.

In the Old Testament, Sheba was a Benjaminite leader who revolted against King David, recounted in 2 Samuel. ==In the Bible== Woodcut by Johann Christoph Weigel, 1695, depicting the events of 2 Samuel 20. In the top of the picture, Sheba's head is thrown down over the wall, while the corpse of Amasa lies in the foreground. Sheba was a son of Bichri, of the family of Becher, the son of Benjamin, and thus of the tribe of King Saul. When David returned to Jerusalem after the defeat of Absalom, strife arose between the ten tribes and the Tribe of Judah, because the latter took the lead in bringing back the king. Sheba took advantage of this state of things, and raised the standard of revolt, proclaiming, \\"We have no part in David.\\" With his followers he proceeded northward. David seeing it necessary to check this revolt, ordered Amasa to summon the army. When Amasa delayed his task, David appointed Abishai and Joab to take the gibborim (\\"mighty men\\") and the body-guard and such troops as he could gather, and pursue Sheba. Joab took the opportunity to kill Amasa. Then Joab and Abishai arrived at the city of Abel-beth-maachah, where they knew Sheba to be hiding. They besieged the city. An unnamed wise woman from the city convinced Joab not to destroy Abel Beth-Maacah, because the people did not want Sheba hiding there. She told the people of the city to kill Sheba, and his head was thrown over the wall to Joab. ==In the Talmud== In Tosefta Terumot 7:19, the rabbis debate whether it was proper under Jewish law to give up Sheba in order to save the city from Joab's army. Rabbi Simeon bar Yochai said giving up Sheba is forbidden. Rabbi Judah bar Ilai said the wise woman acted properly because Joab had the city surrounded. Everyone in the city would be killed including Sheba so it was better to give up Sheba and save everyone else. This story served as the source for the subsequent halachic discussion whether it is permissible for a group or community to save itself by sacrificing an individual. The Tosefta establishes the principle that we may not save a community by sacrificing an individual, unless the original demand was for a specified individual. R. Shimon b. Lakish adds the condition that the specified individual be deserving of death because of a crime he committed. This view has been codified by Maimonides in his code of Jewish Law.Mishneh Torah, Yesodei Hatorah, 5:5 Sanhedrin 101b identified Sheba with two other men: > \\"A Tanna taught: Nebat, Micah, and Sheba the son of Bichri are one and the > same.\\" The three interpreted signs and portents to mean that they would > reign. \\"Three beheld but did not see.\\" ==References== Category:Hebrew Bible people Category:Deaths by decapitation Category:Books of Samuel ","title":"Sheba son of Bichri"},{"id":"845237","text":"==Book of the Year== :Mark Haddon, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time ==Children's Book== Winner: *David Almond, The Fire-Eaters Shortlist: *Catherine Fisher, The Oracle *Michael Morpurgo, Private Peaceful *Jeanne Willis, Naked Without a Hat ==First Novel== Winner: *DBC Pierre, Vernon God Little Shortlist: *Anne Donovan, Buddha Da *Paul Murray, An Evening of Long Goodbyes *Talitha Stevenson, An Empty Room ==Novel== Winner: *Mark Haddon, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time Shortlist: *Rachel Cusk, The Lucky Ones *Shena Mackay, Heligoland *Barbara Trapido, Frankie & Stankie ==Biography== Winner: *D.

H. Burnett established Genoa in 1892; he gave the community the name \\"Genoa\\" because he believed that the climate was similar to the climate of Genoa, Italy. The post office opened during that year. The founder built a railroad depot serving the Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad, five houses, one hotel, and one store. The community was located along a main street that is now known as Almeda Genoa Road (the road from Almeda to Genoa). The east end of the community was the Old Galveston Road (Texas State Highway 3) and the Galveston, Houston, Henderson Railroad. The western edge was Freestone Street and the railway just to the west. Where the main street continued east from Old Galveston Road became known as Genoa Redbluff (the road from Genoa to Redbluff). The Handbook of Texas stated that Genoa \\"grew slowly.\\" In 1914 the community had 200 people and several businesses, including a general store, a dairy, a nursery, a blacksmith shop, and a carpenter. By 1925 the community had 100 people; the population remained at this level until around 1941. During that year Genoa had 400 people and fifteen businesses. The population remained at that level until Houston annexed Genoa in the mid-1960s. ==Government and infrastructure== ===Local government=== Houston City Council District E serves Genoa.City of Houston, Council District Maps, District E .\\" City of Houston.

She was a Liberal Member of the National Assembly of Quebec from 1989 to 1998, a Liberal Member of Parliament from 2002 to 2006, and a member of the Cabinet of Prime Minister Paul Martin. == Background == All four of Frulla's grandparents were born in Italy and like many Italian Quebeckers, her family was strongly federalist and Quebec Liberal oriented. In college she says she was not politically involved as she voted \\"yes\\" in the 1980 referendum, believing it was only fair to give Ren√© L√©vesque's government a mandate to negotiate, but when the results were strongly \\"no\\", she reverted to federalism. She then later worked as a marketer for Labatt Breweries when she regularly met with government officials and eventually joined the Quebec Liberals under Robert Bourassa.http://www.cbc.ca/video/news/audioplayer.html?clipid=2284802611 ==Early career== From 1974 to 1976, Frulla worked for the public affairs service of the organizing committee for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. She subsequently became the first woman reporter accredited to cover professional sport in the electronic media. ==Provincial politics== From 1989 to 1998, she represented the riding of Marguerite-Bourgeoys in the National Assembly of Quebec. She was Minister of Communications and Minister of Cultural Affairs. She was vice-chair of the \\"No\\" committee in the 1995 Quebec referendum. However, on November 1, 2007, while appearing on the RDI program Le Club des Ex, she admitted to having voted for the \\"Yes\\" side in the 1980 referendum. In 1998, she left the National Assembly to host her own show, Liza, on public broadcaster Radio-Canada until 2002. ==Federal politics== She was elected to Parliament in a 2002 by-election in the now-defunct riding of Verdun‚ÄîSaint- Henri‚ÄîSaint-Paul‚ÄîPointe-Saint-Charles. After that riding was merged with portions of neighbouring ridings to form Jeanne-Le Ber, she was re-elected by a razor-thin margin over Thierry St-Cyr in 2004; she subsequently lost to him in 2006. Frulla has the prenominal \\"the Honourable\\" and the postnominal \\"PC\\" for life by virtue of being made a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada on December 12, 2003. She was the Minister of Canadian Heritage and Minister responsible for the Status of Women in the cabinet of Prime Minister Paul Martin and previously served as Minister of Social Development. ==Honours== In 2016, she was made an Officer of the National Order of Quebec.

She was known as \\"The Queen of Vaudeville\\" during the height of her popularity from the early 1900s until the early 1920s. Tanguay also appeared in films, and was the first performer to achieve national mass-media celebrity, with publicists and newspapers covering her tours from coast-to-coast, out-earning the likes of contemporaries Enrico Caruso and Harry Houdini at one time, and being described by Edward Bernays, \\"the father of public relations\\", as \\"our first symbol of emergence from the Victorian age.\\" ==Early life== Holyoke's Parsons Hall, where Tanguay made her humble debut at amateur nights as a young girl, wearing several knit chair-throws and the fabric of an old umbrella as her dressErdman, Andrew. Queen of Vaudeville: The Story of Eva Tanguay, Cornell University Press, 2012 pp. 30‚Äì32, 36‚Äì38, 47, 93‚Äì94, 100‚Äì03, 114‚Äì15, 139‚Äì43, 212‚Äì14, 222‚Äì23. Eva Tanguay was born in 1878 in Marbleton, Quebec.Alan Phillip. Into the 20th Century 1900/1910, \\"Canada's Illustrated History\\" series, Natural Science of Canada Ltd., 1977, p. 17 Her father was a doctor. Before she reached the age of six, her family moved from Quebec's Eastern Townships to Holyoke, Massachusetts. Her father died soon after. While still a child she developed an interest in the performing arts, making her first appearance on stage at the age of eight, circa 1886, at an amateur night in Holyoke. In her earliest days she was promoted through a small theater company operated by one Paul C. Winkelmann, a successful 16-year-old multi- instrumentalist who lived next door to her family, and used his influence to give a testimonial benefit show for her at the Holyoke Opera House, a venue which she would return to years later after establishing her own act. thumb Two years later, she was touring professionally with a production of a stage adaptation of the popular Frances Hodgson Burnett novel Little Lord Fauntleroy. Tanguay eventually landed a spot in the Broadway musical My Lady in 1901. The 1904 show The Chaperons led to her rise in popularity. By 1905, she was also performing in vaudeville as a solo act, where she would spend much of the remainder of her career. ==Stage career== Advertisement (1916) The Wild Girl (1917) Although she possessed only an average voice, the enthusiasm with which Tanguay performed her suggestive songs soon made her an audience favorite. She went on to have a long-lasting vaudeville career and eventually commanded one of the highest salaries of any performer of the day, earning as much as $3,500 a week (about $90,000 in 2019 dollars) at the height of her fame around 1910.McLean, Albert F., American Vaudeville as Ritual (Univ. of Kentucky. Press, 1965), p. 54. After seeing her perform, English poet and sexual revolutionary Aleister Crowley called Tanguay America's equivalent to Europe's music hall greats, Marie Lloyd of England and Yvette Guilbert of France. The American Genius wrote \\"is unlike all others. The 'cultured' artist, in this country, is always a mediocrity...The true American is, above all things, FREE; with all the advantages and disadvantages that that implies. His genius is a soul lonely, disolate, reaching to perfection in some unguessed direction...Eva Tanguay is the perfect American artist. She is...starry chaste in her colossal corruption.\\"Aleister Crowley, \\"Drama be Damned! An Appreciation of Eva Tanguay\\", The International (pp. 127‚Äì28), New York, April 1918; reproduced on the site of Thelema Lodge Calendar for June 1996 e.v., Berkeley, CA. Retrieved April 21, 2008. Tanguay is remembered for brassy, self-confident songs that symbolized the emancipated woman, such as \\"It's All Been Done Before but Not the Way I Do It\\", \\"I Want Someone to Go Wild with Me\\", \\"Go as Far as You Like\\", and \\"That's Why They Call Me Tabasco\\". In showbiz circles, she was nicknamed the \\"I Don't Care Girl\\" after her most famous song, \\"I Don't Care\\". She was brought in to star in the 1909 Ziegfeld Follies, where she replaced the husband and wife team of Jack Norworth and Nora Bayes, who were engaged in a bitter salary and personal feud with Ziegfeld. Tanguay requested that the musical number \\"Moving Day in Jungle Town\\" be taken from rising talent Sophie Tucker and given to her. Despite this, the two later became close friends. Tanguay spent lavishly on publicity campaigns and costumes. One obituary notes that a \\"clever manager\\" told Tanguay early in her career that money made money. She never forgot the lesson, buying huge ads at her own expense, and on one occasion, allegedly spending twice her salary on publicity.Obituary, New York Herald Tribune, January 12, 1947. Gaining free publicity with outrageous behavior was one of her strengths. In 1907, she stayed with married entertainment journalist and publicist C.F. Zittel in a Brooklyn hotel for nearly a week. Zittel's wife uncovered the affair by hiring detectives dressed as room-service bellhops to burst into the room. The event made headlines and did not damage Eva's popularity, reputation, or box-office success. She also got her name in the papers for allegedly being kidnapped, allegedly having her jewels stolen, and being fined $50 in Louisville, Kentucky for throwing a stagehand down a flight of stairs.Gilbert, Douglas, American Vaudeville: Its Life and Times (Dover Publications 1940), p. 329; ===Stage costume=== Her costumes were as extravagant as her personality. In 1910, a year after the Lincoln penny was issued, Tanguay appeared on stage in a coat entirely covered in the new coins.Silverman, Sime, \\"Eva Tanguay\\", Variety, September 24, 1910. ===Recording=== Tanguay only made one known recording (\\"I Don't Care\\") in 1922 for Nordskog Records. In addition to her singing career, she starred in two film comedies which used the screen to capture her lusty stage vitality. The first, titled Energetic Eva, was made in 1916. The following year, she starred with Tom Moore in The Wild Girl. ===Retirement=== Tanguay was said to have lost more than $2 million (about $30,000,000 in 2019 dollars) in the Wall Street crash of 1929.Barry, Ed, \\"Eva Tanguay‚Äî'I Don't Care' Girl‚ÄîSlips Away, Taking an Era with Her\\", Variety, January 15, 1947. In the 1930s, she retired from show business. Cataracts caused her to lose her sight, but Sophie Tucker, a friend from vaudeville days, paid for an operation that helped to restore some of her vision. ==Autobiography== At the time of her death, Tanguay was working on her autobiography, to be titled Up and Down the Ladder. Three excerpts from the autobiography were published in Hearst newspapers in 1946 and 1947. ==Death and film portrayal== Eva Tanguay died on January 11, 1947, age 68, in Hollywood. She was interred in the Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery, now Hollywood Forever Cemetery. In 1953, Mitzi Gaynor portrayed Eva Tanguay in a fictionalized version of her life in the Hollywood motion picture, The I Don't Care Girl. ==Family== Tanguay married twice, although she was incorrectly reported to have been married up to four times, due in part to her 1908 public engagement to extremely popular cross-dressing performer Julian Eltinge, who played the bride while she dressed in traditional male formal attire. They exchanged rings but they never legally wed. Her first marriage was to dancer John Ford in 1913, but they divorced after four years. Following her divorce, Tanguay was romantically linked, though never married, as was sometimes reported, to vaudeville dancer Roscoe Ails. She terminated the relationship after Ails' behavior became increasingly erratic and violent. In 1927, aged 49, Tanguay married her piano accompanist, 23-year-old Al Parado. Shortly after the marriage she had it annulled on the grounds of fraud. She claimed that Parado had at least two other names which he used so frequently that she was not sure which one was real.\\"Eva Tanguay Seeks Marriage Annulment\\", The New York Times, October 9, 1927. The marriage was actually a publicity ploy, and was dissolved by Tanguay when it did not bear the intended promotional results. ==See also== *Blanche Merrill ==References== ==Literature== * Andrew L.

He described himself as \\"Breton, de foi Catholique\\". His works include masses and organ music, some based on Gregorian themes, enhanced by polymodal harmonies, as well as music for other forces.Sadie, S. and Tyrrell, J. (eds.) (2004), The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Oxford University Press, ==Biography== Langlais was born in La Fontenelle (Ille-et-Vilaine, Brittany), a small village near Mont Saint-Michel, France. Langlais became blind due to glaucoma when he was only two years old and was sent to the Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles (National Institute for Blind Children) in Paris, where he began to study the organ, with Andr√© Marchal. From there he progressed to the Paris Conservatoire, obtaining prizes in organ and studying composition with Marcel Dupr√© and Paul Dukas. He also studied improvisation with Charles Tournemire. After graduating, Langlais returned to the National Institute for Blind Children to teach, and also taught at the Schola Cantorum in Paris from 1961 to 1976. Many of his students went on to become important musicians, including organists and composers; among them was the American Kathleen Thomerson, who later published a bio-bibliography about him. It was as an organist that Langlais made his name, following in the footsteps of C√©sar Franck and Tournemire as organiste titulaire at the Basilica of Sainte- Clotilde in Paris in 1945, a post in which he remained until 1988. He was much in demand as a concert organist, and toured widely across Europe and the United States. Langlais died in Paris aged 84, and was survived by his second wife Marie-Louise Jaquet-Langlais and three children, Janine, Claude and Caroline. ==Music== Langlais was a prolific composer, composing 254 works with opus numbers, the first of which was his Prelude and Fugue for organ (1927), and the last his Trio (1990), another organ piece. Although best known as a composer of organ music and sacred choral music, he also composed a number of instrumental, orchestral and chamber works and some secular song settings. Langlais' music is written in a highly individual eclectic style, venturing well beyond what might be expected of mid-twentieth-century French music, with rich and complex harmonies and overlapping modes, sometimes more tonal than his contemporary, friend and countryman Olivier Messiaen, sometimes related to his two predecessors at Sainte-Clotilde, Franck and Tournemire, but sometimes also employing serial techniques and often exhibiting an earthy, Celtic folkiness which owes not a little to Bartok: \\"Il y a toujours des artichous dans sa musique\\" as one early reviewer wrote. His best-known works include his four-part masses, Messe solennelle and Missa Salve Regina, his Missa in simplicitate for unison voice and organ, and his many organ compositions, including: *Hymne d'actions de gr√¢ces from Three Gregorian Paraphrases *La nativit√© and Les rameaux (The Palms) (Po√®mes Evangeliques) *Chant h√©ro√Øque, Chant de paix, and De profundis from Nine Pieces *Kyrie \\"Orbis factor\\" from Livre ≈ìcum√©nique *Incantation pour un jour saint (Incantation for Easter) *Cantilene (Suite br√®ve) *Suite m√©di√©vale *Folkloric Suite *Trois m√©ditations sur la Sainte Trinit√© *F√™te, Op. 51 *24 Pieces for harmonium or organ, Op. 6 ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Langlais joue Langlais, 1976 * Missa Salve Regina; Messe solennelle, (English Chamber Orchestra Brass Ensemble; The Choir of Westminster Cathedral/David Hill), 1988 * Jean Langlais Live, St. Augustin, Wien, 1993 * Organ works (Kevin Bowyer), 1994 * Messe solennelle - Missa in Simplicitate - Missa Misericordiae Domini - Ensemble Vocal Jean Sourisse, dir.

In the episode \\"Give Blood\\", he wears a Slayer shirt, while in the Christmas special \\"It's a Miserable Life\\" Beavis is seen wearing a Winger shirt during the alternate reality section of the episode. He is slightly shorter than his best friend Butt-Head, although he appears to be the same height when viewed at a distance because of his hairstyle. Beavis works as a fry cook at the (fictional) fast food restaurant Burger World and once defiantly revealed that he is a fan of the rock band Bon Jovi to Butt-Head, who dislikes the band and its leader Jon Bon Jovi. Beavis' name was inspired by a friend of Judge's from his college days named Bobby Beavis. ==Personality== Dan Tobin of The Boston Phoenix described Beavis as \\"the sidekick and follower\\" who developed into \\"more of a loose cannon\\". Mike Judge once said in an interview that Beavis \\"is a zero\\" when it comes to intelligence; indeed, Beavis is often oblivious to what should be obvious. Generally submissive to Butt-Head and willing to tolerate a large amount of physical and verbal abuse, Beavis nonetheless has limits. In \\"Murder Site\\", Beavis was driven to attack and nearly kill Butt- Head, who ceaselessly called him \\"Butt-knocker\\", a term which Beavis resents. Beavis also stood up to Butt-Head while they were watching the video for Rancid's \\"Nihilism\\": Butt-Head kept talking about it derisively, prompting Beavis to tell Butt-Head to shut up. When Butt-Head reacted with fury, ordering Beavis never again to tell him to shut up and threatening to attack him, Beavis preemptively kicked Butt-Head in the testicles, told him to shut up again, and walked out of the room to get something to eat. In another episode, while the duo were watching a Bon Jovi video, Beavis claimed to like one part of the song, causing Butt-Head to slap him in disgust. After being struck a few times, Beavis kicked Butt-Head in the groin and proclaimed \\"Bon Jovi rules!\\".Featured in \\"Prank Call\\", but only the version shown during the Super Bowl special In spite of his overt idiocy, Beavis possesses a number of character strengths. He can be inadvertently witty and, when discussing subjects that neither he nor Butt-Head understand, he is more likely to guess the actual mechanisms at work. Also, on the rare occasion that a female exhibits interest in one of the duo, it is usually Beavis who gets the attention.\\"Vidiots\\", \\"Another Friday Night\\", \\"Teen Talk\\", \\"Letters to Santa Butt-Head\\" in \\"Christmas Special\\" This could be because of Beavis' somewhat childlike temperament, which is less off-putting than Butt-Head's crasser, more blatantly sexual approaches. For example, when the two encounter members of the opposite sex, Butt-Head will typically lead off with a smug opening line such as \\"Hey, baby\\", which invariably flops; Beavis, on the other hand, will usually approach the woman with a less obvious \\"Hi!\\" or \\"Hey, how's it going?\\". Easily influenced by Butt-Head, however, Beavis will often imitate his buddy's cruder pick-up lines. Beavis has also shown instances of insight on such topics as the true meaning of Christmas, or in his analysis of a video by Korn. However, in both instances Beavis seems to be either in a trance or possessed, and shortly afterward he displays no recollection of what he just said. ===Recklessness=== Beavis has a more volatile, unpredictable nature. His hasty actions usually end in disaster, ranging from being deported to Mexico\\"Vaya Con Cornholio\\" to severely injuring himself and occasional arrest for crimes such as trespassing.\\"Woodshop\\" In some early episodes, Beavis displays signs of being a pyromaniac.\\"Home Improvement\\", \\"Comedians\\" and \\"Stewart's House\\" Though his obsession with fire remained an obvious trait, as the seasons progressed and network censorship pressures increased, his fixation became more of a passing gag. In a deleted scene from the film, Beavis steals the Declaration of Independence to use as toilet paper. ===Cornholio=== Beavis as the Great Cornholio Cornholio is an alter ego of Beavis. Though the Cornholio character was developed in the episode \\"The Great Cornholio\\", Beavis first plays the entity as a passing gag in \\"Generation in Crisis\\". Beavis sometimes undergoes a radical personality change, usually after consuming large amounts of sugar and/or caffeine. In \\"Holy Cornholio\\", the transformation occurs after Beavis takes many pain pills. He pulls his shirt collar over his head, raises his forearms in a right angle to his chest, and then begins to yell or scream erratically, producing a stream of gibberish and strange noises, with his eyes wide. Cornholio is a normally dormant persona (apparently the name is derived from the word \\"cornhole\\"). Cornholio tends to wander aimlessly while reciting \\"I am the Great Cornholio! I need TP for my bunghole!\\" in an odd faux-Spanish accent. Whenever someone asks him a question or challenges him in a threatening or negative manner, Cornholio will respond with \\"Are you threatening me?!\\" Sometimes Beavis will momentarily talk normally before resuming the persona of Cornholio. When he stops acting as the Cornholio persona, Beavis usually has no memory of what happened. In the guise of Cornholio, Beavis becomes a successful beat poet.\\"Buttniks\\" In \\"Vaya Con Cornholio\\", he is deported to Mexico after wrongfully being subjected to immigration detention by an agent of the INS. During his detention the agent and his superior attempt to make sense of the gibberish, going so far as to look up the definition of \\"bunghole\\". In that same episode, he claims to be from Lake Titicaca (because of the scatological sound of its name), but when asked where it is, he responds (incorrectly) with \\"Nicaragua\\".Lake Titicaca actually sits on the border of Peru and Bolivia. Nicaragua may be one of the few things Beavis remembers from class lectures. Beavis' teacher, Mr. Van Driessen, refers to Nicaragua during a lecture on world economic systems in \\"The Great Cornholio\\", after which Beavis repeats the word while pacing back and forth in the classroom. Cornholio resurfaces in \\"Bungholio: Lord of the Harvest\\", in which he steals candy from everyone and Butt-Head tails him. He had stood up to Todd Ianuzzi, who demanded he move out of the road. Todd prepared to beat Beavis up in his Cornholio form with his friends. He later spares Beavis deeming him too insane, in favor of beating up the saner Butt- Head. ===Relationship with Butt-Head=== Though the closest of confidants, Beavis and Butt-Head have a jaded, violent, and at times borderline sadistic relationship. Butt-Head often insults and physically abuses Beavis (usually by slapping him, sometimes accompanied by a request to \\"Settle down, Beavis!\\" if Butt-Head feels his friend is getting a bit too hyperactive, as he often does). On occasion, Beavis will fight back or stand up for himself (\\"Madame Blavatsky\\", \\"They're Coming to Take Me Away, Huh Huh\\"). His favorite means of retribution is kicking Butt-Head in the testicles. On at least one occasion, Beavis throws the first punch. In \\"Canoe\\", he initiates a fight by smacking Butt-Head across the head with a paddle (although Butt-Head goaded him into doing it). Butt-Head usually knows when Beavis is approaching his breaking point and will back off (as seen when he calls Beavis \\"Buttknocker\\" or insults Metallica one too many times). In \\"Choke\\", he specifically states that Butt- Head is \\"not really my friend\\". Nevertheless, it can be inferred that the duo are still best friends, considering their shared activities, residency, interests, and their lack of any other friends. The two usually complement each other when one makes any sort of endeavor, especially if it involves their lifelong goal to 'score with chicks'. Beavis is usually a follower, willingly taking Butt-Head's instructions and cooperating in his endeavors. This appears to be a byproduct of Beavis' own general witlessness rather than any fear of Butt-Head's abuse ‚Äî as demonstrated in the alternate reality of \\"It‚Äôs a Miserable Life\\",A parody of the classic Christmas movie It's A Wonderful Life in which Butt-head had never been born and Beavis was instead the dim but productive friend of younger neighbor and schoolmate Stewart Stevenson. ===Relationship with other characters=== Like Butt-Head, Beavis shares scorn for Stewart and Mr. Van Driessen. Though he shares Butt-Head's mutual hatred for Coach Buzzcut for the way he exploited their lack of intelligence, manliness and strength, Beavis has a little respect for him. He has shown some level of respect for Daria, as she is the only student who tolerates the duo the most without losing her cool. ===Traits=== While Butt- Head's main interest in life is \\"chicks\\", Beavis seems to be more interested in toilet humor and displays of violence. Beavis has a penchant for making off-beat sound effects to suit the occasion. Whenever he sees something that is sexually arousing, he imitates a spring (onomatopoetically saying \\"Boi-oi- oi-oi-oiiing!!!\\") indicating a quick erection. He sometimes makes a Bronx cheer by puckering his lips. He occasionally does impersonations, such as of Principal McVicker (\\"Speech Therapy\\"), motivational speaker Mr. Manners/Mr. Candy (\\"Manners Suck/Candy Sale\\"), and Woody Woodpecker (\\"Top O' the Mountain\\"). During one episode, Beavis conspicuously reveals that he is sometimes prone to getting erections in the company of other men. A special ability of his is speaking backwards, as seen in \\"Vidiots\\", while the duo review a music video; however, he forgets how to do so by the end of the video. Beavis also displays a predilection for defecating and things that are related to it, and in a high-pitched tone will often enthusiastically utter the word \\"poop\\", or will say the word \\"plop\\" to indicate a bowel movement. He frequently pulls down his pants during music video reviews. He also took Kaopectate once after hearing it is for diarrhea under the misconception he would get diarrhea; he was only soothed by an enormous bowel movement which he saved in his dresser drawer, much to Butt-Head's disgust. Beavis sometimes displays examples of the idiot savant when slapped hard by Butt-Head or when attempting to pass out by holding his breath and blowing into his thumb, in which cases Beavis starts to make intellectual statements usually regarding the music videos he is viewing. ===Beavis' parents=== Beavis' family is occasionally mentioned but has never been seen in the show in person. An example is when Beavis states: \\"My mom's a slut... meh heh heh.\\" According to discussion during some music video segments, Beavis's mother shares her son's peculiar hairstyle, is somewhat obese, and (most significantly) is an ignorant slut. While Beavis is conscious of his mother's promiscuity, it doesn't seem to bother him much, as he often laughs along in agreement whenever Butt-Head brings it up (in fact, when Butt-Head refers to Beavis's mother as a whore, Beavis nonchalantly says \\"She's not a whore, she's a slut, she doesn't charge for it\\"). The irony, however, is lost on Butt-Head, whose own mother's promiscuity is implied in Beavis and Butt-Head Do America. In \\"Be All You Can Be\\", Butt-Head states that Beavis's father was in the Navy and told the Army recruiter that Beavis's father was \\"a seaman\\" ‚Äî although this could have been a joke designed to allow Butt-Head to use the word \\"semen\\". In Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, Beavis is reunited with his biological father, who seems to exhibit the same pyromania obsession as Beavis, as well as an overt physical resemblance. He is said to be a drifter and a one-time roadie for rock band M√∂tley Cr√ºe. However, they remain oblivious of their father-son relationship and part ways before they make the connection. ==Parodies== In the 1996 Paramount comedy Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, at the beginning during the King Kong/Godzilla-like scene, Beavis is called Beaviszilla; however, when he sees Butt-Head, he calls him by his real name. ==References== Category:Beavis and Butt-Head characters Category:Fictional characters from Texas Category:Fictional characters with multiple personalities Category:Television characters introduced in 1992 Category:Child characters in television Category:Child characters in animated films Category:Comedy film characters Category:Animated human characters Category:Male characters in animation Category:Teenage characters in film Category:Teenage characters in television Category:Fictional characters with alter egos ","title":"Beavis"},{"id":"845298","text":"Roath Brook flowing through Roath Park in the snow Roath () is a district and community to the north-east of the city centre of Cardiff, capital of Wales. There is no community council for the area which is mostly covered by the Plasnewydd electoral ward, and stretches from Adamsdown in the south to Roath Park in the north. ==Description== Post Office and shops on Albany Road Its main shopping streets are Albany Road, City Road, and Wellfield Road. The area is characterised by its several tree-lined avenues and Victorian era terraced streets. Roath houses a very diverse population including a large number of students, being very close to the main university campuses, a large ethnic minority population and many young professionals. Parts of Roath are among the most affluent districts of Cardiff, although subdivision of the large Victorian properties is starting to occur in the areas at the south end of the district. Its close proximity to the city centre, its number of local amenities, churches, shops and restaurants and public houses and the famous Roath Park make it a popular area to live.https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/apr/23/lets-move-to-roath-and- cathays-cardiff { border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 align=center style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - Heath Cyncoed  - Cathays Roath Penylan - City centre  Adamsdown } ==History== Roath Court Y Rhath (Rahat, Raath 13th c.) is likely a development of the Brythonic word for ramparts, cognate with the Irish word r√°th (earthwork, fortification), the latinised form of this word (Ratae) appears elsewhere in Roman Britain (such as Ratae Corieltauvorum). This may suggest a pre-existing Iron Age settlement, likely on the site of the old manor house which was surrounded by earthworks and a ditch for centuries. Alternatively, it could derive from the name given to the Roman settlement in Cardiff, Ratostabius. Roath Court is a nineteenth-century villa on the site of the medieval manor house of Roath. Since 1952 it has been a funeral home. Its Georgian portico, designed by Robert Adam in 1766 for Bowood House, Wiltshire, was moved there in 1956. St Margaret's Church, Roath Roath contains the Church of Saint Margaret of Antioch, built in 1870 on the site of an earlier Norman chapel and the new Gothic revival church. Designed by Llandaff architect John Prichard on a Greek Cross plan, the latter was financed totally by the third Marquess of Bute, in spite of his conversion to Catholicism in 1868. Inside is an opulent mausoleum housing tombs of nine members of the Bute family, including the First Marquess and his wives. The tower of St Margaret's was finally completed in 1926. Roath once had a railway station on the South Wales Main Line, but this closed in 1917. Prior to the 2010s the community was known as Plasnewydd, though was renamed as Roath, being a name that was more widely recognised. ==Notable buildings and amenities== *Cardiff University, Engineering Building *Roath Library *St Margaret's Church (and the Bute Mausoleum) *Mackintosh Sports Institute (formerly Plasnewydd) *The Mansion House, Richmond Road, used as the mayor's residence for much of the 20th century. *The Gate Arts Centre, Keppoch Street *James Summers Funeral Home, Roath Court *Shah Jalal Mosque, Crwys Road (formerly Capel Crwys) *Trinity Methodist Church *Albany Primary Schoolhttp://www.albanyprm.co.uk/ *Roath Park Primaryhttp://www.roathparkprimaryschool.co.uk/contact-details/ *St. Martin's Church, Albany Roadstmartininroath.webplus.net *Hodges' Residence and the Dewmisters Crib *St. Edward's Church, Blenheim RoadRoath.org.uk *Roath Park *St. Peters RFC * Plasnewydd Community Hall * Saint Peter's RC Primary School ==Festivals and events== Since 2009 the annual Made in Roath arts festival has taken place in October.

It was built up in the late 19th century on the land of two farms of the same name: Upper Splott and Lower Splott Farms. Splott is characterised by its once vast steelworks and rows of tightly knit terraced houses. The suburb of Splott falls into the Splott electoral ward. Fanciful suggestions for the origin of the name have included a truncation of \\"God's Plot\\", as the land belonged to the Bishop of Llandaff in medieval times, and a derivation of plat, meaning a grassy area of land. The name of the original farm would seem to be Middle English \\"splott\\", from Old English (speck, blot, patch of land) and the word is to be found in other English place names in the Vale of Glamorgan, Gower, and Pembrokeshire, as well as in Somerset and Devon, in the West Country of England, from where it was presumably introduced by English settlers. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. The population of Splott in the United Kingdom Census 2001 was 12,074, in 5,101 households, of which only 183 are detached homes. Of the 8,221 adults in the area, only 1,000 have the lowest category of qualifications (Level 1 or below). In 2011 the population had increased to 13,261. ==History== Splott is a traditional part of the City of Cardiff. Most of the housing stock is Victorian in origin built during the expansion of the City's iron and steel industry to house workers in these factories. The early history of Splott is given in the Cardiff Records. This says that \\"Splott was anciently held by the Bawdrips of Penmark. It consisted mainly of two farms, called the Upper and Lower Splott, situated between Roath Village and the sea.\\" * 1440 ‚Äì the Splott is mentioned as bounding certain lands of Isabel le Despenser, Countess of Worcester and Warwick. * 1596 ‚Äì William Bawdrip of Penmark built a fair house at the Splott and made it his chief residence. * 1626 ‚Äì William Bawdrip of Splott was Member of Parliament for Cardiff. He sold Penmark and Splott to Sir Edward Lewis of the Van. * 1638 ‚Äì Sir Edward Lewis of the Van died. * 1740 ‚Äì the Llandaff Survey of this year mentions a chief rent of four shillings as payable in respect of Splott Farm in Roath. Habershon Street, named after William Habershon No residential or industrial development took place in the area, however, until the end of the 19th century. In 1880 the whole area between Cardiff and the Bristol Channel (known as East Moors) was marshland, apart from the farms of Pengam and Splott. Residential development started in the 1880s, constructing streets, houses, shops, taverns and Board Schools; subsequently, Churches were built by various denominations. The streets and housing were laid out by Habershon & Fawckner, architects for the Tredegar Estate. Splott park opened in 1901. Inevitably there have been many changes in the years since Splott was first developed. Portmanmoor Road is now an industrial estate and its former Victorian era housing was demolished along with adjoining Enid Street, Layard Street, and Menelaus Street which no longer exist. There is a strong community focus and this is centred on churches, schools, pubs and sporting teams. Roman Catholics remain well catered for through St. Albans and the associated school. This continues to produce rugby teams of all age groups which compete in city leagues. Splott University Settlement was one of the most successful British baseball teams, winning the Welsh League title several times. Bridgend Street was one of the 17 streets demolished in the early 1970s, but to this day is recalled in the name of Bridgend Street Football Club, which plays in the Welsh Football League. The nickname of Bridgend Street is \\"The Mission\\" and motto is \\"Deeds Not Words\\". Their home base is The Fleurs Social Club on Portmanmoor Road. In 2016 the Tremorfa district, which had previously been included as part of Splott, became a local government community in its own right. There is no community council for the Splott or Tremorfa areas. In July 2017 the derelict citadel church collapsed with debris falling on the nearby rail line. One man died. ==The Welsh language== The earliest known example of Welsh-language literature from Splott is a poem by the Elizabethan poet Dafydd Benwyn on the death of William Bawdrip of Splott. It includes the couplet: 'Du yw'r Ysblot dros y blaid, / Diweniaith, da i weiniaid' ('Splott is black for his people, / Without flattery, (he was) good to the weak').Dafydd H. Evans, 'The Life and Work of Dafydd Benwyn' (DPhil Thesis, Pxford University, 1982). With the growth of Splott as a suburb of Cardiff, English was established as the main language. The number of Welsh speakers in the area increased when East Moors Steelworks was opened in 1891 with large numbers of workers from the parent plant at Dowlais near Merthyr Tydfil. To meet the religious needs of these Welsh-speaking workers, Welsh-language chapels were opened in the area, including Ainon, Walker Road (1894, Welsh Baptists);G. Sorton Davies, These Forty Years: A History of Ainon Baptist Church, Splott, Cardiff, 1889-1929 (Cardiff, 1929). Bethlehem, Eyre Stree (1895, Welsh Independents);J. Austin Jenkins ac R. Edwards James, The History of Nonconformity in Cardiff (Cardiff, 1901), t. 92. and Jerusalem, Manon Street/Walker Road (1892, Calvinistic Methodists).J. Austin Jenkins ac R. Edwards James, The History of Nonconformity in Cardiff (Cardiff, 1901), t. 92 According to the 2011 UK Census the number of Splott residents over three years old who could speak Welsh was 1,077 (8.6%).'Welsh Language Commissioner: 2011 Census results by Community. Splott has one Welsh-medium primary school, Ysgol Glan Morfa. ==People== Wilson Street, Splott *John Humphrys (radio and TV presenter) was born in Splott. *Dame Shirley Bassey (singer) originated from nearby Tiger Bay, but moved to Splott at the age of two and attended Moorland Primary School and Splott Secondary Modern School. *Clive Sullivan (Welsh rugby league player) grew up in Splott. *Helen Raynor, writer of the Torchwood episode \\"Ghost Machine\\", which is also largely set there, lives in Splott. *Lynn Bowles, the morning traffic reporter on BBC Radio 2, was born in Splott.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-43547367 ==Popular culture== Farmville Road, Splott Splott is featured in the third episode (\\"Ghost Machine\\") of the BBC science fiction drama and Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood, which is set in Cardiff. It is also mentioned somewhat humorously in other episodes, due to its English pronunciation, which was referred to as \\"SP-LO-T\\" but was corrected as \\"SP-LO\\". Splott also features in the Torchwood novel Another Life. Splott and the neighbouring district of Tremorfa are the settings for several works by Welsh playwright Peter Gill. Because the morning BBC Radio 2 traffic reports are read by the Splott-born Lynn Bowles, many listener contributions to the Terry Wogan and Ken Bruce shows feature (primarily fictitious) anecdotes humorously referring to the district. On 14 December 2009, Wogan was made Lord of Splott live on his radio programme in its final week, by resident and broadcaster Noreen Bray. She invested him on behalf of TAFFS, or Terry's Adoring Fans From Splott.http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/12/12/city-honour- for-sir-terry-wogan-lord-of-splott-91466-25373916/ Splott is the setting of ‚ÄúIphigenia in Splott‚Äù, a modern day reworking of the classic Greek drama, by Welsh playwright Gary Owen. It premiered at Cardiff‚Äôs Sherman Theatre in 2015, before transferring to the National Theatre in London and the 59E59 Theaters in New York in 2016. ==Governance== Splott is also an electoral ward and parish of Cardiff, Wales. The electoral ward includes the areas of Pengam Green, Splott and Tremorfa. The ward is bounded by Adamsdown and Penylan to the northwest; Rumney and Trowbridge to the north east; the Severn estuary to the south east and Butetown to the south west. It is a multi-member ward, with three councillors. The ward has generally returned Labour party candidates, including Jack Brooks, who served two terms as Leader of South Glamorgan County Council. Since May 2017, the ward has been represented by Welsh Labour Councillors Jane Henshaw, Ed Stubbs, and Huw Thomas. Huw Thomas is also the current Leader of Cardiff Council. In the UK Parliament, Splott is part of the constituency of Cardiff South and Penarth. Its most prominent MP was former Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan. The current MP is Labour's Stephen Doughty, first elected in 2012. In the Welsh Assembly, Splott is part of the constituency of Cardiff South and Penarth, whose current AM is Labour's Vaughan Gething, first elected in 2011. ==Splott Green Hub== In October 2018, two Splott residents Rebecca Clark and Hannah Garcia, launched a public campaign to stop the local council from selling land near Railway Street in Splott for development. A petition protesting against the decision gathered more than 2,500 signatures within five days. Green City, also known as Green Squirrel, are a community-led environmental group that want to transform the unused site into a new eco-friendly social hub for Splott and Adamsdown. The campaign successfully stopped the sale and the council have now leased the land to the group for community benefit. According to the 2014 Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation, Splott and Adamsdown are among the most deprived areas of Wales, and both wards have an open space deficit compared to the standard recreational open space requirement for Cardiff. It is hoped that the Railway Street site can be used to help improve the local community and support other green projects in the area. According to the project website, plans could include a sustainable community hub building for workshops and events as well as affordable shipping containers for small businesses. Food growing and composting areas, bee hives and other wildlife habitats could also be created on the land to support local biodiversity and outdoor play and learning. ==Cardiff districts== Splott is part of the STAR area of Cardiff (STAR stands for Splott, Tremorfa, Adamsdown and Roath, four inner city suburbs born out of the industrial revolution). The former STAR Centre leisure facility is located in Splott (although this was closed when the new STAR Hub was opened and the former STAR Centre was then utilized by the NHS). Splott Pool was also closed and demolished to make way for the new STAR Hub, that opened in September 2016. The area is served by Splott Library (within the new hub) and Roath Library. The latter was re-located to the Cardiff Royal Infirmary after the previous branch library building on Newport Road was closed due to prohibitive renovation costs. In January 2017, plans were announced for a new permanent library and cafe in the former hospital chapel. In 2018, a deal was made for the previous library building to be taken over by a local dance organization. { border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 align=center style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - Riverside City centre Adamsdown - Grangetown Butetown Splott -  Cardiff Bay Tremorfa } ==See also== *For details of Splott Aerodrome, see RAF Pengam Moors ==References== ==External links== Splott today *Splott page on BBC Wales south-east *Splott Albion Blacks *Moorland Primary School, Splott *The Splott Community Workshop *St. Saviour's Church, Splott History of Splott *Genuki *Manor of Splott *Splott Mission and St Alban's, Splott *www.geograph.co.uk : photos of Splott and surrounding area Category:Communities in Cardiff ","title":"Splott"},{"id":"845307","text":"Birchgrove may refer to: * Birchgrove, West Sussex, a location in England ==Australia== * Birchgrove, New South Wales, a suburb in the municipality of Leichhardt **Birchgrove Park, a park and sports ground ==Wales== * Birchgrove, Cardiff, a district in the city of Cardiff * Birchgrove, Swansea, a community and large village in the city and county of Swansea ","title":"Birchgrove"},{"id":"845318","text":"The DRYAD Numeral Cipher/Authentication System (KTC 1400 D) is a simple, paper cryptographic system employed by the U.S. military for authentication and for encryption of short, numerical messages. Each unit with a radio is given a set of matching DRYAD code sheets. A single sheet is valid for a limited time (e.g. 6 hours), called a cryptoperiod. A sample DRYAD cipher sheet A DRYAD cipher sheet contains 25 lines or rows of scrambled letters. Each line is labeled by the letters A to Y in a column on the left of the page. Each row contains a random permutation of the letters A through Y. The letters in each row are grouped into 10 columns labeled 0 through 9. The columns under 0, 1, 2 and 5 have more letters than the other digits, which have just two each. While crude, the DRYAD Numeral Cipher/Authentication System has the advantage of being fast, relatively easy and requires no extra equipment (such as a pencil). The presence of more cipher-text columns under the digits 0, 1, 2 and 5, is apparently intended to make ciphertext frequency analysis more difficult. But much of the security comes from keeping the cryptoperiod short. DRYAD can be used in two modes, authentication or encryption. ==Authentication== Holder for coding sheets with slide to facilitate use For authentication, a challenging station selects a letter at random from the left most column followed by a second (randomly selected) letter in the row of the first chosen letter. The station being challenged would then authenticate by picking the letter directly below the row and position of the second letter selected.Army Field Manual 24-19, Chapter 5U.S. Army Field Manual FM 24-12, Chapter 7, Communications Security Operations For example, using the example cipher sheet to the right and the NATO phonetic alphabet, Jason could challenge Peggy by transmitting \\"authenticate Alpha Bravo\\". Peggy's correct response would then be \\"authenticate Yankee\\". Another form used involves selecting the third letter to the right of the second letter chosen by the challenging station (Jason's \\"Bravo\\" letter). Both the directional offset (up, down, left or right) and numeral offset can be values different from the examples given here, but must be agreed upon and understood by both parties before authentication. One problem presented is that an enemy impersonator has a one in 25 chance of guessing the correct response (one in 24 if a letter is selected from the same row). A solution to this is for Jason to require Peggy to authenticate twice; lowering the impersonator's odds of guessing the correct response to one in 625. The downside to this method is reduced longevity of the current DRYAD page, since the page is getting twice as much use as a single-authentication scheme. ==Encryption== The second mode is used to encrypt short numeric information (such as map coordinates or a new radio frequency). The coder arbitrarily selects two letters at random. The first letter designates a row in the current active page. The second one is used similarly to the authentication mode, except that the letter immediately to the right is selected. This selected letter is called the \\"SET LETTER.\\" Numbers are enciphered one digit at a time. A ciphertext letter is chosen from the selected row (the row designated by the SET LETTER) in the column under the plain text digit. If the digit occurs more than once in the number, the coder is instructed to choose a different letter in the same column. All the digits in a single plaintext number are encoded from the same row. (There is also a provision for encoding letters associated with map grid coordinates.) ==See also== * BATCO -- similar paper based tactical cipher used by the British forces * M-94 -- tactical cipher used in World War II * Dryad -- original meaning in mythology * Polyalphabetic cipher * Substitution cipher ==References== *Further explanation of the DRYAD Numeral Cipher/Authentication System *U.S. Army Field Manual FM 24-35 Category:Classical ciphers Category:National Security Agency encryption devices ","title":"DRYAD"},{"id":"845319","text":"Yostin Lissette \\"Justine\\" Pasek Pati√±o (born 27 August 1979) is a Polish- Panamanian model, philanthropist and beauty queen who was crowned Miss Universe 2002. Originally the first runner-up at the Miss Universe 2002 competition, Pasek became the first ever runner-up to be crowned the winner after the dethronement of original winner Oxana Fedorova. ==Early life== Pasek was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine to a Panamanian mother and a Polish father; her mother was a homemaker, while her father was an engineer. Despite her birth name being Yostin, Pasek was raised being affectionately referred to by her Polish name Justyna. She is the eldest of three children and only daughter; her two younger brothers are Edward and Alvaro. The family resided in Ukraine for one year, and later moved to the village of Wo≈ºuczyn, near Zamo≈õƒá in southeastern Poland, close to the border with Ukraine. After her mother finished her studies in chemistry, the family left Poland and settled in Panama City, where Pasek was raised. Prior to pageantry, Pasek worked as a professional model in Panama City; she appeared in television productions and fashion shows. Pasek had planned to complete a university degree in environmental engineering in New Zealand with her brothers, and later work for the Smithsonian Research Center. ==Career== Miss Universe 2002, Justine Pasek, with Miss USA 2002 and Miss Teen USA 2002 sign autographs for American soldiers at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in February 2003. Pasek's start in the modelling world took place when she joined the \\"Chica Modelo\\" (a model search) contest in 1996 where she won the award for Best Editorial Model. It also gave her the chance to work for Physical Modelos, her official modeling agency as of today. As a model Pasek has taken part in calendars, commercials, and as a stewardess in different events. ===Pageantry=== Pasek wearing the Mikimoto Crown at her welcoming parade in November 2002 After participating in the national contest Se√±orita Panam√° 2001 on August 30, 2001; she earned the title Se√±orita Panam√° Universe and, obtaining the right to represent her country in the 51st edition of the Miss Universe 2002 pageant, was held at the Coliseo Roberto Clemente, San Juan, Puerto Rico on May 29, 2002. She finished as first runner-up Four months after the pageant, Pasek became the first woman to assume the crown when the reigning Miss Universe Oxana Fedorova was dethroned by the organization for not fulfilling the duties stipulated in her contract. After traveling to New York City for a modeling assignment, she was notified of these events in the back of a limousine, becoming the first Panamanian Miss Universe. Pasek was formally crowned Miss Universe 2002 by then pageant co- owner Donald Trump in New York City, and a busy week of press engagements followed. Pasek also received an elaborate Mikimoto Crown worth $250,000 as well as an extensive prize package. As Miss Universe, Pasek represented the Miss Universe Organization. Her \\"sister\\" 2002 titleholders were Vanessa Semrow (Miss Teen USA, of Wisconsin ) and Shauntay Hinton (Miss USA, (District of Columbia). A self-described \\"citizen of the world\\", Pasek has since traveled to Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, Egypt, Aruba, Ecuador, Peru, Cuba, Canada, Mexico, and the United States. She championed the cause of HIV/AIDS and established the first HIV/AIDS prevention center in her country. As part of her year-long reign as Miss Universe, she lived in New York City in a riverside apartment provided by the Miss Universe Organization. She worked with the Global Health Council, the Harvard AIDS Institute, AmFAR, and the Centers for Disease Control's \\"Act Now\\" campaign. Pasek relinquished her crown to Dominican Republic's Amelia Vega in the 2003 competition, held in Panama. Having worked as a model since 1996, Pasek has since modeled for Christian Dior, among other fashion campaigns. ==References== ==Notes== ==External links== Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Miss Universe 2002 contestants Category:Miss Universe winners Category:Panamanian beauty pageant winners Category:Panamanian female models Category:Panamanian people of Polish descent Category:People from Panama City Category:People from Tomasz√≥w Lubelski County Category:Polish emigrants to Panama Category:Se√±orita Panam√° ","title":"Justine Pasek"},{"id":"845321","text":"Joan Dawson Bakewell, Baroness Bakewell, (n√©e Rowlands; born 16 April 1933), is an English journalist, television presenter and Labour Party peer. Baroness Bakewell is President of Birkbeck, University of London; she is also an author and playwright, and has been awarded Humanist of the year for services to humanism. ==Early life and education== Bakewell was born on 16 April 1933 in Heaton Moor, Stockport, Cheshire, England, and moved to Hazel Grove before she was three. Both her grandfathers were factory workers: the Rowlands branch stemmed from the lead mining villages of the Ystwyth valley, in Wales. Her great-grandfather moved to Salford, where he was a preacher in the Church Army. Her grandfather was an iron turner. On the maternal side, her grandfather was a cooper in Ardwick Brewery. The family lived in Gorton, a district of Manchester. She was educated at Stockport High School for Girls, a grammar school in local authority control, where she became head girl. She won a scholarship and attended Newnham College at the University of Cambridge, where she studied Economics, then History. ==Career== ===Broadcasting=== Joan Bakewell began her career as a studio manager for BBC Radio, before moving into television. She first became known as one of the presenters of an early BBC2 programme, Late Night Line-Up (1965‚Äì72 and 2008). Frank Muir dubbed her \\"the thinking man's crumpet\\"Manchester Celebrities , John Moss, Papillon (Manchester UK) Limited during this period and the moniker stuck, although Bakewell herself dislikes the epithet. In 1968 she took the role of narrator of the BBC TV production of Cold Comfort Farm, a three-part serial, and played a TV interviewer in the 1960s film The Touchables. Bakewell co-presented Reports Action, a Sunday teatime programme which encouraged the public to donate their services to various good causes, for Granada Television during 1976‚Äì78. Subsequently, she returned to the BBC, and co-presented a short-lived late night television arts' programme; briefly worked on the BBC Radio 4 PM programme, and was Newsnight's arts' correspondent (1986‚Äì88). Arts' coverage was then dropped from news programmes in the era of John Birt's changes to the BBC. Bakewell switched to being the main presenter of the ethics documentary series Heart of the Matter, which she presented for 12 years. She resigned from the programme in 1999. In 2001, Bakewell wrote and presented a four-part series for BBC Two called Taboo, a personal exploration of the concepts of taste, decency and censorship. The programme dealt frankly with sex and nudity and in some cases pushed the boundaries of what is permissible on mainstream television. Bakewell used frank language and \\"four-letter words\\" to describe pornography and sex toys. She watched a couple having sex while they were making a pornographic film and read out an \\"obscene\\" extract from the novel Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller. Taboo was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions by the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association by then headed by John Beyer. Following the complaint, Bakewell faced the nominal prospect of being charged with blasphemous libel after she recited part of an erotic poem by James Kirkup concerning a Roman centurion's affection for Jesus, \\"The Love that Dares to Speak its Name\\". After its first publication in 1976, Denis Lemon, the editor of Gay News, had been given a nine-month suspended jail sentence. Bakewell later wrote that in the programme she \\"read this poem with extreme distaste and I hope that showed on my face.\\" The Broadcasting Standards Commission rejected complaints from viewers. On 26 May 2008, Bakewell introduced an archive evening on BBC Parliament called Permissive Night. The programme examined the liberalising legislation passed by Parliament in the late 1960s. Topics covered included changes to divorce law, the death penalty, the legalisation of abortion, the Race Relations Bill, the partial decriminalisation of homosexual acts (using editions of the documentary series Man Alive) and the relaxation of censorship. Permissive Night concluded with a special one-off edition of Late Night Line-Up which discussed the themes raised in the programmes over the course of the evening. In 2009, she won \\"Journalist of the Year\\" at the annual Stonewall Awards. In 2017, Bakewell was one of the minor hosts of the Channel 5 documentary series Secrets of the National Trust. She presents Portrait Artist of the Year alongside Stephen Mangan for Sky Television. ===Writing=== Bakewell writes for the British newspaper The Independent in the 'Editorial and Opinion' section. Typically, her articles concern aspects of social life and culture but sometimes she writes more political articles, often focusing on aspects relevant to life in the United Kingdom. Formerly, from 2003, she wrote the \\"Just Seventy\\" column for The Guardian newspaper. In September 2008 she began a fortnightly column in the Times2 section of The Times. Her first novel was published in March 2009 by Virago Press. All the Nice Girls drew on her experiences in war-time Merseyside to tell the story of a school \\"adopting\\" a ship. In 2017 a play first written by Bakewell in 1978 in response to Betrayal, entitled Keeping in Touch, was premiered on BBC Radio 4. ==Honours and public roles== She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1999 Birthday Honours and was Chairman of the British Film Institute from 2000 to 2002. She was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours. In November 2008, Joan Bakewell was appointed a voice for older people by the UK Government. She is Chairman of the theatre company Shared Experience. It was announced in November 2010 that she would be awarded a life peerage, joining the Labour benches. She was created Baroness Bakewell, of Stockport in the County of Greater Manchester, on 21 January 2011, and formally introduced to the House of Lords on 25 January 2011UK Parliament website (accessed 12 February 2012) supported by fellow Labour peers Lord Puttnam and Baroness Kennedy. On 20 July 2011, Bakewell was made an honorary graduate at the University of Essex (DU Essex). She also has an honorary doctorate from the University of Chester. In September 2017, Bakewell was elected co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Humanist Group, the cross-party group which represents humanists in Parliament. Later that year, the charity Humanists UK awarded Bakewell its prize for Humanist of the Year, in recognition of her achievements in broadcasting and services to humanism and other good causes. ==Views and advocacy== In 2008, Bakewell criticised the absence of older women on British television. She said: \\"I think the fact that people are phased out, people like Moira Stuart and Selina [Scott] ‚Äì out of the public eye ‚Äì when they become a certain age is a real disadvantage to serious broadcasting. There's a whole segment of the British population that does not see its equivalent in serious broadcasting and that is women over 55. Now, that is not healthy for a broadcasting organisation's relationship with its audience. The public should be represented on the screen in various colours, forms, sexualities, whatever.\\" In 2010, Bakewell criticised the side effects of the sexual revolution of the 1960s. She said: \\"I never thought I would hear myself say as much, but I'm with Mrs Whitehouse on this one. The liberal mood back in the '60s was that sex was pleasurable and wholesome and shouldn't be seen as dirty and wicked. The Pill allowed women to make choices for themselves. Of course, that meant the risk of making the wrong choice. But we all hoped girls would grow to handle the new freedoms wisely. Then everything came to be about money: so now sex is about money, too. Why else sexualise the clothes of little girls, run TV channels of naked wives, have sex magazines edging out the serious stuff on newsagents' shelves? It's money that's corrupted us and women are being used and are even collaborating.\\"\\"Dame Joan Bakewell says Mary Whitehouse was right\\", BBC News, 1 June 2010 In August 2014, Bakewell was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue. In March 2016, she commented in The Sunday Times that anorexia is connected with a general narcissism in 21st century western culture, and that \\"no-one has anorexia in societies where there is not enough food\\". The comments provoked strong criticism from social and print media, and an apology for hurt caused from Bakewell herself. ==Private life== Bakewell's autobiography, The Centre of the Bed, was published in 2004 and concentrates on her experiences as a woman in the male- dominated media industry. It also touches on the extra-marital affair Bakewell had with playwright Harold Pinter (between 1962 to 1969), while she was married to Michael Bakewell (the marriage lasted from 1955 to 1972) and Pinter was married to the actress Vivien Merchant. The affair was the basis for Pinter's 1978 play Betrayal, adapted in 1983 as a film.The Centre of the Bed ‚Äì Hodder & Stoughton Ltd (2003) () == Legacy == The Joan Bakewell Archive is housed at the British Library.

The Cardiff community population taken at the 2011 census was 17,417. https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W04000852 Llanishen is well known as the home of the 'Tax Offices', the tallest buildings in north Cardiff and a landmark for miles around. The office complex overlooks the 'Crystal and Fishguard estates', Parc T≈∑ Glas industrial estate, old village, leafy suburban roads and various parkland that constitute the district. Llanishen is also home to a fully featured Leisure Centre and the former Llanishen Reservoir ‚Äì a local beauty spot that is connected to a green corridor which bisects the city from the rising hills in the north to Cardiff Bay in the south. St Isan's parish church ==History== Originally wooded farm land, in A.D. 535 two monks came eastwards from the small religious settlement of Llandaff, aiming to establish new settlements, or \\"llans\\", in the land below Caerphilly mountain. With fresh water from the Nant Fawr stream, one of the monks Isan founded his llan on the site of the modern day Oval Park. In 1089 in the Battle of the Heath, the Normans fought the Welsh Celts north of the settlement. The victorious Normans expanded Llanishen, starting work on a church to the north which was completed in the 12th century. Although Oliver Cromwell had ties with Llanishen and the neighbouring village of Llysfaen, the village remained undisturbed until 1871, when the Rhymney Railway was given permission to break the stranglehold of the Taff Vale Railway into Cardiff Docks. Building a line from Caerphilly to Crockherbtown Junction just north of Cardiff Queen Street, its tunnel to the north resulted in a number of accidental deaths, many of whom are buried in St Isans church. The railway and the development of Llanishen railway station allowed wealthy Cardiff business people to commute from the village to the centre of city easily, resulting in the expansion of the villages population by 20,000 between 1851 and 1871. In 1887, the two new reservoirs of Llanishen were built to allow distribution of water collected in the Brecon Beacons to the city. In 1922, after expansion north by the city and south by the village, Llanishen became a suburb of Cardiff. Llanishen Golf Club was established in 1905. Development of the village since has been through redevelopment of the former farming and military land into commercial usage and housing development. Thornhill was part of the Llanishen civil parish until November 2016 when a new community of Thornhill was created north of the Linear Park.Ruth Mosalski (23 March 2015) \\"No longer will housebuyers be able to mock estate agents...

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) occupies an 18-storey tower block (Phase 2) plus some of the 11-storey Gleider House (Phase 1) in a complex of HM Government offices, employing more than 2,700 staff on site in late 2007 (mainly Revenue division ‚Äî including an enquiry centre, or IREC). In 2003, a retail complex of six stores was built; the current occupants are Marks and Spencer Simply Food, Boots, Laura Ashley, HomeSense, Starbucks, DW sports/MiFit, Pets at Home and Carphone Warehouse. The HM Government buildings are due to be vacated by HMRC at the end of 2020 and, with the exception of Ty Gleider, demolished to be replaced by family houses and apartments. ===ROF Cardiff=== The First World War, like in many locations, brought death to the young men of the village, but the Second World War brought greater effect. With the development of ROF Bridgend, a Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Cardiff was opened in 1940 to take the explosives from Bridgend and produce tank, anti-tank and field guns. Air defences against paratroopers were placed in nearby fields, but this was strengthened in 1941 when the Royal Air Force established both a RAF Regiment base and a glider training facility. In 1943 the United States Army began using the facilities to hold troops and undertake local training, including basic flight in Tiger Cubs. The Americans left in June 1944 as the Allies prepared for D-Day. In 1987 ROF Cardiff became an Atomic Weapons Establishment. It closed down in February 1997. ROF Cardiff since closure has become the site of major housing development: George Wimpey called theirs 'Parklands', Barratt built 'Ty Glas Square' and Leadbitter built 'Llys Enfys', with Bellway and Persimmon/Charles Church creating even more housing between the AWE site and the HMRC building. The site will also host a new public open space, the final element to be constructed (2010), to include children's play area, sports pitch and community garden. Part of the George Wimpey development has been named 'Watkins Square' and the Barratt development 'Tasker Square' ‚Äì after Wales' famous Victoria Cross winner Sir Tasker Watkins, who died during 2007. ===Other offices=== The Orchards complex The Orchards complex, formerly the site of the National Coal Board's regional office, housed the offices of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and the Welsh office of the Camelot Group, operators of the UK National Lottery. In 2018, the Orchards were demolished and McCarthy and Stone build a new Independent Living complex called Llys Faith. ==Shopping and Leisure== ===Llanishen Village=== Llanishen Village is a small local shopping centre offering a range of shops and services to the surrounding community, including; The Church Inn, St. Isan Church, About Flowers Florist, Parsons Bakery, Lendons of Cardiff Model shop, Selahs Caf√©, Co-op Food, Dean & Driscoll Optometrists, City Hospice Charity Shop, Fintans Chip Shop, The Beauty Spot, Principality Building Society, Peter Alan Estate Agents, McColls, Daisy Daisy - Beautiful Cards & Gifts, Llanishen Post Office, Jeffrey Ross Estate Agents, The Old Joinery, NatWest Bank, Lloyds Bank, Barclays Bank, Ladbrokes, ICE Hair and Beauty, Soulsby and Darlington Opticians, M.W Phillips Chemist, Jego Hair and Beauty, New Image Hair and Beauty and Darlows Estate Agents. Llanishen Library is a full-time branch library within Llanishen Hub with an IT suite, community room for hire and free to use PC's and telephone access. ===Llanishen and Lisvane Reservoirs=== Two non-functional reservoirs (the smaller Lisvane Reservoir is adjoined to Llanishen Reservoir). Llanishen Reservoir forms the end of a Victorian water supply system stretching from the Brecon Beacons to Cardiff and has recently had its CADW listing confirmed. It had been under threat from an American-led commercial development for domestic housing, where the proposed houses would be built around a reduced lake. But the CADW designation plus the Site of Special Scientific Interest for grassland fungi on the embankments of the former reservoir, will make it very difficult for a developer to gain building permission. Locals are campaigning to make the area a registered village green. ===Cardiff Sailing Centre=== Cardiff Sailing Centre (Llanishen Sailing Centre) is a sailing school teaching sailing, windsurfing and powerboating. ===Llanishen Leisure Centre=== Llanishen Leisure Centre Llanishen Leisure Centre is situated in Llanishen and is the largest in the city. It has a pool with a wave machine, Squash courts, multi-activity Sports Hall, an improved Gym & Fitness suite & Pool side Cafeteria. It is built in a very similar layout to the Pentwyn leisure centre. ===Llanishen Skate Park=== In the large 'Gleider Field' alongside the leisure centre, there is a public skatepark. The skate park facilities include two quarter-pipes, a jump box, two flat banks, a driveway, a spine, a rail, a wallride and a halfpipe. Llanishen is home to RampWorld Cardiff, which is Wales' largest indoor Skatepark and operates as a non-profit making charity to provide indoor extreme sports training facilities. GoAir Trampoline Park is also located on the Ty Glas Business Park in Llanishen. ===Llanishen Rugby Club=== A new 3G playing and training ground for Llanishen RFC, located off Heol Hir, was built in 2018 as part of a new partnership with Llanishen High School. The Club House is off Ty Glas Avenue nearby. The club's former training ground and pitch was located off Usk Road and was sold to a housing developer to fund the new 3G pitch facilities ===Public Houses=== Llanishen's pubs include The Church Inn, believed to be the oldest surviving pub in Cardiff, and the Wolf's Castle. ==Schools== Llanishen Methodist Church ===Primary schools=== * Christ the King R.C.

Three bus routes serve Llanishen: *27 Thornhill from Central Station ‚Äì operated by Cardiff Bus *28 from Station Road (Thornhill) or (Roath Park-Cathays-Central Stn) ‚Äì operated by Cardiff Bus *86 (Lisvane) ‚Äì operated by Stagecoach Wales ==Government and politics== Llanishen electoral ward in Cardiff ===Electoral ward=== Llanishen is part of an electoral ward with Thornhill, and is also a community of the City of Cardiff. There is no community council for the area. The electoral ward of Llanishen falls within the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff North. It covers some or all of the geographical areas of Llanishen and Thornhill. It is bounded by the wards of Lisvane to the northwest; Cyncoed to the southeast; Heath to the south; and Rhiwbina to the west. ===Representation=== *Represented in the British House of Commons since 2017 by Anna McMorrin, Member of Parliament (Labour), Cardiff North). *Represented in the Welsh Assembly since 2011 by Julie Morgan, AM (Labour, Cardiff North) * Represented on Cardiff Council since 2004 by Jonathan Burns, Craig Piper, Richard Foley and Robert Smith; all elected as members of the Welsh Conservative Party.

He was formerly the Member of Parliament for the riding of Vancouver Kingsway. He was first elected as a Liberal and served as Minister of Industry under Prime Minister Paul Martin. After controversially crossing the floor to join Stephen Harper's Conservatives, he served as Minister of International Trade and Minister for the Pacific Gateway and the Vancouver-Whistler Olympics, followed by Minister of Foreign Affairs. == Early life and business career == Emerson was born in Montreal, Quebec. He attended the University of Alberta and obtained his Bachelor of Economics degree in 1968 and his Master of Economics degree in 1970. He then went on to Queen's University where he received his Ph.D in Economics. In 1975, after working as a researcher for the Economic Council of Canada, Emerson moved to British Columbia and joined the public service. In 1984, he became Deputy Minister of Finance. In 1986, Emerson was appointed president and Chief Executive Officer of the Western & Pacific Bank of Canada. He transformed it into the Western Bank of Canada- the only regional bank to survive and prosper. Four years later, he returned as Deputy Minister of Finance and was quickly promoted to Deputy Minister to the Premier and President of the British Columbia Trade Development Corporation. From 1992 to 1997, Emerson was president and Chief Executive Officer of the newly created Vancouver International Airport Authority. In 1998, Emerson was appointed president and Chief Executive Officer of Canfor Corporation, a leading integrated forest products company and Canada's largest producer of softwood lumber. With 8,100 workers and annual revenues of $3.2 billion servicing 10% of the U.S. market, Canfor operates pulp and paper mills as well as 19 sawmills across B.C., two in Alberta and one in Quebec. Despite US duties and a higher Canadian dollar, Emerson managed to increase profits and raise share prices through a major acquisition deal and efficiency upgrades, which increased capacity by 30% while reducing production costs by 24%. In 2008, Emerson joined private equity firm CAI Capital Management as a senior advisor. Emerson's directorships included: Terasen Inc; Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Company of Canada; Vice- Chairman of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives; Chair, British Columbia Ferry Services Inc.; and Chairman and Director of Genus Resource Management Technologies Inc. == Election history == Bypassing the nomination process, Paul Martin appointed David Emerson as the Liberal candidate in Vancouver Kingsway for the 2004 election. In the general election, he narrowly defeated Ian Waddell of the New Democratic Party by 1,351 votes. Waddell had previously represented Vancouver Kingsway from 1979 until 1988, when the riding was abolished and Waddell transferred to Port Moody‚ÄîCoquitlam. The 2006 election saw a rematch between Emerson and Waddell. This time, Emerson won handily, defeating Waddell by nearly 10 points as the Liberals nearly swept Vancouver. Emerson attracted some media attention in December 2005 with a comment that NDP leader Jack Layton had a \\"boiled dog's head smile\\". While the term is translated from the common and mild Cantonese insult \\"ÁÉöÁÜüÁãóÈ†≠\\", Emerson said that he believed it to be a humorous phrase indicating a person with an \\"overextended grin\\". Emerson said that his wife, a Cantonese speaker, used the phrase to describe him when he posed for pictures. ==Crossing the floor== At some point between election day and the day Stephen Harper was due to be sworn in as prime minister, Emerson accepted an offer from Harper to cross the floor and become Minister of International Trade in Harper's new Conservative minority government. According to Emerson, British Columbia Conservative campaign coordinator John Reynolds called him the day after the election to ask if he was interested in having a conversation with Harper. Gaining regional representation in Cabinet from key metropolitan areas, such as Vancouver, according to Harper, was key to the decision in asking Emerson to cross the floor. Indeed, 2006 marked the first time in decades that a centre- right party had been completely shut out in Vancouver. However, Emerson's Conservative opponent, Kanman Wong, claimed on February 10, 2006 that Emerson was seriously considering crossing the floor during the run-up to the election. Wong added that he would have stood down in Emerson's favour had he done so. In any case, Emerson's decision was kept secret from his Liberal colleagues, the press, and even most Conservatives until February 6, 2006, when he arrived at Rideau Hall, the official residence of the Governor General, for the swearing-in of the new government. In addition to his International Trade portfolio, Emerson was given responsibility for the Pacific Gateway and the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, areas of particular importance to the riding of Vancouver-Kingsway and in general, the Greater Vancouver area. He was ranked third in Cabinet in the order of precedence, behind Harper and House Leader Rob Nicholson, by virtue of his appointment to the Privy Council in 2004. Emerson had given no public indication that he was thinking of leaving the Liberal Party during the election campaign, Wong's remarks notwithstanding. As a Cabinet minister he had been featured prominently in Liberal TV ads in British Columbia promoting that party as the best choice for voters. He launched several blistering attacks against Harper and the Conservatives during the campaign, including one assertion that under a Harper government, \\"the strong [would] survive and the weak die\\". On election night, he told supporters that he wanted to be \\"Stephen Harper's worst nightmare.\\" In an interview with CTV after being sworn in, he clarified to reporters about the heated partisan rhetoric used during the campaign. Emerson told CTV that he runs his riding office on a nonpartisan basis, and that his first priority was the interests of the people of Vancouver Kingsway. ===Controversy=== Part of the Emerson controversy stems from Vancouver Kingsway's voting history. The riding has long been one of the more left- leaning ones in Vancouver; most election battles take place between the Liberals and NDP. Vancouver Kingsway previously existed from 1953 to 1988 and elected a Progressive Conservative candidate only once, during the 1958 Tory landslide. It has not elected a Conservative or any member of its predecessor parties‚Äîthe PCs, the Reform Party of Canada or the Canadian Alliance‚Äîsince its recreation in 1997. The Conservative candidate in 2006, Wong, finished a distant third with only 8,700 votes‚Äî12,000 votes behind Emerson and 7,000 behind Waddell‚Äîand 19% of the total vote. In the 2004 election, the Conservative candidate, Jesse Johl, finished with 16.5% of the vote. Both totals were far less than the combined PC/Canadian Alliance vote of 34.4% in 2000. The NDP's vote share of less than 16% in that 2000 election jumped to more than 37% when Emerson first ran in 2004. Liberal MP and former Minister of Health, Ujjal Dosanjh noted that a poll held prior to the election showed less than 20 per cent of residents in the riding knew Emerson by name, lending credence to the assertions that the Liberal banner played a large part in his election and re-election. Liberal National President Mike Eizenga said that Emerson knew \\"if he was running in that riding as a Conservative, he wouldn't have a chance\\" and has demanded his resignation. Democracy Watch, a nonpartisan ethics watchdog, said it planned to complain to the Ethics Commissioner since Emerson was still technically a Liberal minister when he accepted Harper's offer. The group claimed that Emerson's switch violated the federal ethics code and post-employment regulations for officeholders. NDP MP Peter Julian has also called for an inquiry, claiming that the additional benefits Emerson received as a member compared to those he would have received as an opposition MP carry at least the appearance that Emerson acted in his own private interest. Bill Graham, acting parliamentary leader of the Liberal Party and Leader of the Opposition, called Emerson's behaviour cynical and claimed his actions diminished \\"the faith of citizens in a system under which we have to govern.\\" Martin, who left on a vacation to Europe shortly after resigning as prime minister, was \\"astonished\\" by Emerson's defection and criticized both Emerson and Harper for avoiding \\"an appropriate level of scrutiny on this matter -- a decision that I believe robs Canadians and the people of Vancouver Kingsway of a deserved explanation\\". Criticism also came from Emerson's fellow Conservatives. Garth Turner, a Conservative MP from Ontario said that \\"anyone who crosses the floor ultimately should go back to the people for ratification and I stick by it and hopefully in this case that will happen...\\" Turner later stated his belief that his criticism \\"seriously limited\\" his future in the party. Subsequently, he was eventually kicked out of the Conservative caucus and crossed the floor to sit as a Liberal for which he was also criticized. Myron Thompson of Alberta has also called for Emerson to step down and run in a by-election. However, MacKay told CTV's Mike Duffy Live that Emerson wanted to continue and finish the work he already started as Minister of Industry under Martin on a multibillion-dollar softwood lumber deal with the United States‚Äîa deal that could potentially bring a huge windfall to Canada and particularly Emerson's major lumber producing province, British Columbia. MacKay later also said that there was no comparison between Emerson's switch and that of Belinda Stronach. Reynolds also defended Emerson's switch, saying that Vancouver Kingsway got the better end of the bargain since \\"instead of having someone in opposition, they have someone who is a cabinet minister of a new government.\\" As Minister of International Trade, Emerson will have key influence on matters relevant to constituents of Vancouver-Kingsway particularly as The Greater Vancouver Area prepares for the 2010 Olympics. The defection also has the support of Vancouver Mayor Sam Sullivan, British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell, the Vancouver Board of Trade, former Prime Minister Kim Campbell, as well as several prominent businessmen in Vancouver. In a letter dated Monday February 6, the Vancouver Kingsway Liberal riding association requested that Emerson repay $97,000 spent during his re-election campaign. Emerson has stated that he does not intend to repay any expenses, arguing that he has raised large sums for the Liberal party from his corporate connections. On February 8, 2006, Emerson described Liberal attacks on his defection as a sign of \\"deep sickness\\" and said that his children were being treated with hostility at school because of his defection. Harper called the attacks on Emerson \\"superficial\\", the switch was made \\"in the best interests of not just British Columbia but good government\\". Emerson has given some thought to resigning over the furore, but told CBC News in Vancouver on February 10 that he would not resign or run in a byelection. Aside from that appearance, Emerson cancelled a telephone press conference on February 9 due to traffic. The furore has reinvigorated support for legislation requiring MPs who switch parties to step down and run for their own vacancy in a by-election. NDP MP Peter Stoffer announced on February 13 that he would reintroduce a private member's bill making such a provision. Turner plans to introduce a similar bill, despite pressure from his party to back off. Speaking on Vancouver radio station CKNW, Emerson said he would be glad to discuss the bill in Parliament: \\"I'll participate in that debate, I may even vote for it, and I will certainly abide by it.\\" Stoffer's earlier floor-crossing bill (C-251) was defeated during the last Canadian Parliament. Emerson has vowed to resign only if such a law were passed retroactively or if the ethics commissioner found him to be at fault. A crowd of over 700 gathered at an NDP-organized protest rally in Emerson's riding on Saturday February 11. Another smaller rally took place at Emerson's riding office the next day. On April 2, a crowd, variously estimated between 1000 and 1200 participated in a Walk for Democracy organized by a group calling themselves Real Democracy. At times the tightly packed crowd stretched out over five blocks along one lane of Kingsway as the march proceeded along the 2 kilometre route past Emerson's constituency office to the rally. The next day, another group flew an airplane over Canada's parliament asking the Member of Parliament to \\"call home\\". This was in reference to the fact that David Emerson had remained low key and made few public appearances in the riding for the months of February and March. According to an online poll from The Globe and Mail, 77% of respondents wanted Emerson to step down and run in a by- election. A similar online poll conducted by Maclean's magazine showed 66% wanted Emerson to run in a by-election. Ipsos Reid in mid-February 2006 conducted a poll of British Columbians and found that even in staunchly Conservative areas of the province, respondents were 75% in favour of a by- election being called. On March 3, 2006, Ethics Commissioner Bernard Shapiro announced that he was launching a preliminary inquiry into conflict-of- interest allegations against Emerson and Harper. Shapiro says he will look into what influence may have been wielded in the decision by Emerson to cross the floor. On March 20, 2006, Shapiro stated that he was \\"satisfied that no special inducement was offered by Mr. Harper to convince Mr. Emerson to join his cabinet and his party\\". He found no wrongdoing on Emerson's part and recommended a parliamentary debate on floor crossing. ==Resolution of softwood lumber issue== On April 27, 2006, Prime Minister Harper announced that Canada had reached an agreement with the United States on softwood lumber. Working closely with Minister Emerson and Canadian ambassador to the U.S. Michael Wilson, this landmark agreement resolved a dispute disrupting Canada‚ÄìU.S. relations since 1982 when U.S. lumber producers first petitioned against Canadian softwood lumber imports under U.S. countervailing duty law. Previous Liberal governments had enacted two five-year deals, the last one expiring March 31, 2001. Since then, Canada had been locked in costly domestic and international litigation as U.S. lumber companies charged Canada with dumping subsidized lumber into the U.S. market. The softwood lumber deal ensured no quotas or tariffs at current lumber prices, repayment of at least $4 billion in unfairly collected duties to lumber companies, and provincial and regional flexibility depending on operating conditions. \\"Canada‚Äôs bargaining position was strong; our conditions were clear; and this agreement delivers\\", said the prime minister. \\"It‚Äôs a good deal that resolves this long-standing dispute and allows us to move on.\\" The deal also received support from Canada's three major softwood producing provinces, British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario. Following the initial announcement, the province of British Columbia expressed dissatisfaction with the agreement's details. Claiming industry support, B.C.'s forestry minister, Rich Coleman, threatened to \\"derail the deal\\" if the provincial government's concerns were not met. Under contention were several details, including an \\"opt-out\\" clause (allowing either Canadian or U.S. governments to back out of the deal after 23 months). A number of analysts described the deal as a shameful capitulation of Canadian interests. The deal included language requiring all Canadian companies to drop legal actions against the U.S. government. On September 12, 2006, Emerson and U.S Trade Representative Susan Schwab officially signed the deal in Ottawa. The softwood lumber deal was passed on December 6, 2006, and received Royal Assent on December 12, 2006. ==Foreign Affairs ministry== On May 26, 2008, Emerson was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs following the resignation of Maxime Bernier, though it was reported at the time that Emerson's appointment to the position would be brief. In a cabinet shuffle on June 25, 2008, Prime Minister Harper finalized Emerson's position as Minister of Foreign Affairs.The Globe and Mail, June 25, 2008, p. A1. ==Retirement== On September 2, 2008, it was reported that Emerson would not run in the 2008 federal election, citing the lengthy commute from Vancouver to Ottawa as the reason. Also, he wanted time to spend with his son, James, his daughter, Elizabeth, and his son-in law, Patrick. In 2009, he was named co-chair (with Paul Tellier) of the Prime Minister's Advisory Committee on the Public Service. He also became a member of the International Advisory Council of the Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation. == References == ==External links== *DavidEmersonLegal.com - Legal issues arising from David Emerson's 2006 change of political party *Profile *Softwood Lumber Deal * Category:1945 births Category:Anglophone Quebec people Category:Businesspeople from Montreal Category:Businesspeople from Vancouver Category:Canadian bank presidents Category:Canadian Buddhists Category:Canadian chief executives Category:Canadian economists Category:Canadian Ministers of Foreign Affairs Category:Conservative Party of Canada MPs Category:Liberal Party of Canada MPs Category:Living people Category:Members of the 27th Canadian Ministry Category:Members of the 28th Canadian Ministry Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from British Columbia Category:Members of the Order of British Columbia Category:Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada Category:Politicians from Montreal Category:Politicians from Vancouver Category:Queen's University at Kingston alumni Category:University of Alberta alumni ","title":"David Emerson"},{"id":"845331","text":"Jackie Chiles is a fictional character portrayed by American actor Phil Morris in the NBC sitcom Seinfeld. He appears in the series' seventh through ninth seasons as Cosmo Kramer's lawyer. ==Character== Chiles is a parody of famed attorney Johnnie Cochran; both are bespectacled, mustachioed, well-dressed, African American lawyers with the same initials and penchants for grandiose vocabulary. According to the diplomas in his office, Chiles attended Dartmouth College and Stanford Law School. Morris also emulates Cochran's distinctive enunciation and delivery. After appearing in several episodes during the series' later years, Chiles, along with many other minor characters from the show's past, appeared again in the program's finale and was crucial in failing to achieve acquittal of the characters on charges of violating a duty to rescue law. Jackie's catchphrase is saying several adjectives in succession for added emphasis, such as \\"lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!\\" Morris also planned to star as Chiles in a spin-off, but the pilot never came to fruition. NBC executives have claimed that a pilot was never discussed with them. After appearing in character as Chiles in an advertisement for the Honda Odyssey and Diet Dr Pepper, Morris reprised the character again in 2010 for Will Ferrell's Funny or Die website. ==Appearances== *Season Seven: **\\"The Maestro\\" ‚Äî Kramer sneaks a cafe latte into a movie theatre and burns himself while trying to climb over the legs of another patron ‚Äî a satire of the 1994 lawsuit Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants. Jackie describes having to sneak the coffee in as a violation of Kramer's rights as a consumer: \\"It's outrageous, egregious, preposterous.\\" Kramer uses a balm to treat his burn, causing it to be healed. Furthermore, the coffee company offers a settlement of a lifetime of free coffee at all of their stores throughout North America and Europe. Kramer accepts the offer before the executive had finished speaking and mentioned any money, much to Jackie's dismay. **\\"The Caddy\\" ‚Äî Jackie sues Oh Henry! candy bar heiress Sue Ellen Mischke for allegedly causing Kramer personal injury due to an automobile accident. Kramer distracts Jerry while driving when he sees Mischke walking the streets of New York City wearing only a bra. Chiles describes her actions as \\"lewd, lascivious, salacious, outrageous!\\" The lawsuit fails when Kramer, taking the ill advice of his golf caddy, demands she try on the bra to prove it is hers. It fails to fit because she tries donning it over a leotard. Jackie yells at Kramer, \\"Of course a bra's not going to fit on over a leotard. A bra's got to fit right up against a person's skin... like a glove!\\" ‚Äî an obvious parody of the O. J. Simpson murder case. **\\"The Friar's Club\\" ‚Äî Kramer's experiment with polyphasic sleep causes him to fall asleep during a make-out session. His Italian girlfriend thinks he has died and gets some friends to dump him in the Hudson River. When he comes to, Kramer accuses her of trying to murder him. She calls her lawyer, Jackie Chiles. Upon hearing that Kramer is involved, however, Jackie declares, \\"I don't want nothing to do with it!\\" *Season Eight: **\\"The Abstinence\\" ‚Äî Kramer's face ages prematurely when he turns his apartment into a smoking lounge. Kramer consults with Jackie about filing suit against the tobacco companies for his disfigurement. Jackie describes Kramer's face as \\"sallow, unattractive, disgusting.\\" When Kramer asks if he has a case, Jackie's reply is \\"Your face is my case.\\" Jackie and Kramer then meet with a tobacco company lawyer, who alleges that Kramer's face gives him a sense of \\"rugged masculinity.\\" Jackie replies, \\"Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's been exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head.\\" After the lawyer says she will have an offer to settle out of court the next morning, Jackie tells Kramer, \\"Jackie's cashing in on your wretched disfigurement.\\" Kramer settles the case without Jackie's knowledge for a Marlboro Man style billboard in Times Square featuring his own face. Jackie dubs this \\"the most public yet of my many humiliations.\\" **\\"The Comeback\\" ‚Äî Although Jackie does not appear in the episode, Kramer reveals to Jerry that Chiles has put a restraining order on him, barring him from coming within 200 feet of his office. Kramer goes on to explain that because of this, he could not give Jackie a Christmas gift. *Season Nine: **\\"The Finale\\" ‚Äî Jackie represents George, Elaine, Jerry and Kramer when they violate the Good Samaritan law.

Llanrumney was in Monmouthshire until it was incorporated into Cardiff in 1938. ==History== Rhymney River The land where modern Llanrumney stands was left to Keynsham Abbey by the Lord of Glamorgan after the Norman Conquest. According to legend, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the final prince of an independent Wales, was interred in a stone coffin by the monks in 1282, on land where Llanrumney Hall would be built centuries later. After Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries in the sixteenth century, the land passed to the Kemeys family. It remained in their possession until 1951, when it and its grounds were compulsorily purchased by the local authority in order to build the large estates that can be seen there today. The origins of the name Llanrumney are found in the Welsh word glan ('bank, shore') and the Anglicised version of Rhymni, the name of the local river. The substitution of glan for llan ('church') is explained by the fact that in Welsh, 'lan' is the lenited form of both glan and llan. Thus phrases such as 'i Lanrhymni' and 'o Lanrhymni' (that include the common prepositions i 'to' and o 'from') could be understood as referring to a place called either Glanrhymni or Llanrhymni.Gwynedd O. Pierce, 'Under the Eaves: Some Place Names in the Rhymni Valley Area', Morgannwg, 36 (1992), 98. The district is predominantly composed of large scale council estates and is bounded by the wards of Pontprennau & Old St. Mellons to the north, Rumney to the south, Penylan to the southwest, and Pentwyn to the west. The electoral ward of Llanrumney falls within the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff South and Penarth. Eastern Leisure Centre The area has a number of shopping precincts, the largest of which can be found on Countisbury Avenue. The Eastern Leisure Centre is scheduled to be refurbished at a cost of ¬£6.8m. Llanrumney Hall, a reputedly haunted pub, is one of several local locations associated with the pirate Henry Morgan. and is claimed to have been his home from 1635. Llanrumney Library Llanrumney Library opened in 2008, replacing the old Llanrumney Library. Cyncoed Ladies F.C. of the Welsh Premier Women's Football League have been based in the area since 2005 when they were formed. ==Politics== Llanrumney is in the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff South & Penarth and the Welsh Assembly constituency of the same name. Llanrumney is both an electoral ward and a community in Cardiff Council. The ward elects three councillors to represent Llanrumney on Cardiff Council every five years. The community of Llanrumney does not have a community council. ==Transport== Cardiff Bus services 49 and 50 serve the area, with buses running frequently to and from the city centre. Routes 65 and 65A link Llanrumney, along with a number of other local suburbs, to the Heath Hospital. The area is currently accessible only via various junctions along Newport Road, which also connects the suburb to the city centre to the south west and St Mellons, the A48(M) and Newport to the north east. In February 2008, Cardiff County Council approved plans for a new Park and Ride facility to be created on the Rhymney River flood plain adjacent to the nearby Pentwyn Interchange of the A48. In November the same year the site was cleared and access roads created from the nearby A48, signalling the beginning of the project. In December 2019, as part of the council's East Cardiff Industrial Strategy, a plan was announced to ease congestion in east Cardiff by constructing a road and a bridge to link Llanrumney with the Pentwyn Park & Ride site. ==Education== Llanumney has six primary schools: Bryn Hafod, Pen-y- Bryn, Glan-yr-Afon, St Cadoc's, St Mellon's and Bro Eirwg, and one secondary school. Llanrumney High School closed in 2013 as part of the Council's plans to reorganise secondary education in the city. ===High School closure=== On 20 March 2009 Cardiff Council published a legal statutory notice announcing their intention to close Llanrumney High School by 2012 as part of Cardiff County Council's plans to reduce surplus places in schools across the city.

Retrieved 13 September 2018. but also Y Waun Ddyfal) is a district and community in the centre of Cardiff, capital of Wales. It is an old suburb of Cardiff established in 1875. It is very densely populated and contains many older terraced houses giving it a Victorian era atmosphere. The area falls into the Cathays ward. It is the third most populous community in Cardiff, having a population of 18,002 in 2011. ==Etymology== The name is likely to be 'hedges/enclosure where there are wildcats' from Middle English cat(t), connoting possibly given the semi-agricultural, semi-forest nature of the area at the time wildcat rather than domesticated cats, and the plural form of hague/hay, meaning 'enclosure', from Old English haga. An unlikely explanation which is sometimes found is that it is from 'Cad Hayes' ‚Äì cad, the Welsh word for battle, and the various shades of meaning of the medieval English hague/hay above. The current term shares its orthography, but not its pronunciation nor meaning with 'Cathay', an alternative name for China. ==History== By the medieval period farmland outside the old Cardiff Castle, Cathays takes in the northern limit of medieval Cardiff -- marked by the crossroads of Fairoak Road and Crwys Road. After John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute, married The Hon. Charlotte Hickman-Windsor (daughter of Lord Windsor) on 12 November 1766, he inherited great further lands including in Cathays to the north of his existing estate which he had partially had developed. He then bought other properties and farms, to the north and east, including what became Cathays Park. There he built Cathays House at a cost of ¬£40,000 and at further cost landscaped Cathays Park. After his son took over the title he preferred to live in Cardiff Castle so demolished the house in 1815, and turned Cathays Park into purely enclosed parkland used for grazing. ===Suburb of Cardiff=== Ruthin Gardens, opposite right Following the 2nd Marquis' development of Cardiff Docks, and the resultant number of new workers flocking to Cardiff, in 1875 the then rural Cathays became a suburb of Cardiff. At that time, a few streets led off Woodville Road and Cathays Terrace. By 1900 the urbanisation of Cathays was virtually completed. Allensbank and Wedal farms survived briefly. In 1914 they became no more than local place names. Maindy Barracks was opened in 1871, and with United States Army troops temporarily stationed in transit in Cardiff during both World War I and World War II, the footpath between Gelligaer Street and New Zealand Road became known as \\" Road\\", as they came to meet prostitutes. ===Low retirement rate=== {class= !2011 Electoral Ward!!adults!!retired!!as a % of adults - Cathays18,6933701.98% } Of more than 8570 wards in the 2011 census across England and Wales, Cathays ranked 8th lowest in number of retired people and second in Wales behind Menai, a ward associated with Bangor University.UK Government statistics https://www.nomisweb.co.uk Data Downloads [or on-screen generation] - Query - KS106EW: Households with Adults in \\"Employment\\" in wards in England and Wales ==Governance== The community of Cathays does not have a community council for the area. The electoral ward of Cathays includes both the Cathays and Castle communities and elects four city councillors to Cardiff City Council. ==Buildings and structures in Cathays== From 1840, the Taff Vale Railway company developed a railway line through Cathays, where they also developed the Cathays railway works. A major carriage and wagon construction and maintenance facility, it and the associated locomotive depot were taken over and maintained by the Great Western Railway. Post nationalisation in 1946, British Railways sold the business and leased the site to the Pullman Company Ltd, where they maintained their carriages until the 1970s. The depot was closed from the late 1960s, redeveloped for buildings now used by Cardiff University. The carriage and wagon works was redeveloped in the early 2000s, and now houses a Lidl store and a student accommodation block. Cathays railway station opened in 1983, adjacent to the Students' Union building which encloses the railway tracks. In 1875 Nazareth House was opened, to provide accommodation for orphans and the elderly. A popular local charity, one of its many benefactors was the boxer Jim Driscoll, who after burial in Cathays cemetery in 1925 has had his grave tended to this day by the nuns of Nazareth House. In 1898, John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute sold a large piece of land to Cardiff Council for the building of a new City Hall, imposing strict conditions regarding what purpose and where development could take place. As a result, the city hall was built as far south in the purchased block of land as was possible, and the residual area to its north used for civic, cultural and educational purposes only. The City Hall, which cost ¬£129,000, was completed in 1905 when Cardiff was awarded city status. The land purchased by the council to the north of the city hall now houses: *Cardiff University, which moved from Newport Road to Cathays Park in 1909 *National Museum Cardiff, opened in 1927 *Welsh National War Memorial, unveiled in 1928 *Crown Buildings, the Welsh Government's main offices in Cardiff. The largest building in Cathays Park Maindy Pool was a clay pit that had gradually filled with water. After the death by drowning of ten children and adults it was filled in by using it as a rubbish tip. In 1948 the building of Maindy Stadium began on the same site, completed in 1951, which held cycling races in the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. When the stadium was closed and replaced with a leisure centre, part of the site became a swimming pool. Cathays Library is a Carnegie library built in 1906 and refurbished in 2009-10. Companies House holds the registration records of all companies registered in England or Wales. ==Today== Tewkesbury Street in Cathays The area of Cathays, given its proximity to most of Cardiff University's teaching sites and University Hospital of Wales, has seen a dramatic fall in owner-occupation, with a high proportion of houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) which are let through private landlords and letting agencies to the large student population. 2012 figures available under the Freedom of Information Act show that over 70% of the houses in Cathays are now HMOs. The buy-to-let market has deterred young couples, families and first time buyers from setting up home in the area. Cathays High School is an 11-18 mixed comprehensive school that started as a boys Grammar school in 1903 and became a comprehensive high school in 1973.http://www.cathays.cardiff.sch.uk/ Despite the urbanisation of Cathays there is extensive parkland around the civic centre, including Gorsedd Gardens, Queen Alexandra Gardens, Bute Park and Blackweir. ==Transport== Map of the area around Cathays The area is served by Cathays railway station in the east of the area with frequent services south to Cardiff Queen Street and Cardiff Central or north to Aberdare, Merthyr Tydfil or Treherbert via Pontypridd. Cardiff Bus provides many services in the area. The following bus services run along North Road (in the west) going to Cardiff Central bus station in the reverse direction: *21 (Rhiwbina-Pantmawr-Whitchurch) *23 (Whitchurch-Pantmawr-Rhiwbina) *24 (Whitchurch-Llandaff North-Llandaff-Central Stn) *25 (Central Stn) *27 Capital City Green (Birchgrove-Thornhill) Likewise, the following services run north along Crwys Road and/or Whitchurch Road (in the east): *1 Bay Circle (Roath- Tremorfa-Splott-Adamsdown-Central Stn-Bay-Grangetown-Canton-Fairwater- Llandaff-Gabalfa) *2 Bay Circle (As 1 but reversed) *8/9/9A (Heath-University Hospital of Wales) or (Central Stn-Grangetown-Cardiff Bay) *35 (Gabalfa) or (Central Stn-Cardiff Bay) The area is close to the busy Gabalfa Interchange, connecting it with the A48 and the M4 motorway. ==References== ==External links== *Photos of Cathays *Nazareth House { border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 align=center style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - NW Heath Roath Park - Pontcanna Cathays Roath - Riverside City centre Adamsdown } Category:Student quarters Category:Populated places established in 1875 Category:Communities in Cardiff ","title":"Cathays"},{"id":"845336","text":"Butetown electoral division of Cardiff Butetown (or The Docks, ) is a district and community in the south of the city of Cardiff, the capital of Wales. It was originally a model housing estate built in the early 19th century by The 2nd Marquess of Bute, for whose title the area was named. Commonly known as \\"Tiger Bay\\", this area became one of the UK's first multicultural communities with people from over 50 countries settled here by the outbreak of the First World War, working in the docks and allied industries. Some of the largest communities included the Somalis, Yemenis and Greeks, whose influence still lives on today. A Greek Orthodox church still stands at the top of Bute Street. It is known as one of the \\"five towns of Cardiff\\", the others being Crockherbtown, Grangetown, Newtown and Temperance Town. The population of the ward and community taken at the 2011 census was 10,125. ==Development== A school in Butetown in 1943 In the 1960s, most of the original housing was demolished including the historic Loudoun Square, the original heart of Butetown. In its place was a typical 1960s housing estate of low-rise courts and alleys, and two high rise blocks of flats. In the 1980s, the new Atlantic Wharf development was built on the reclaimed West Bute Dock, and has involved the construction of some 1,300 new houses. Together with the developments in the Inner Harbour and Roath Basin, it was hoped this would spur redevelopment and employment in Butetown, but it seems not to have. The divide between the wealthy Cardiff Bay, and the poor Tiger Bay seems as wide as ever, although some of the surviving areas of historic Butetown are becoming prime office and retail locations. With the new Century Wharf development to the west on the banks of the Taff, the housing estate is becoming a little 'boxed in', increasing feelings of exclusion. Over the next few decades, the 1960s housing will require renewal and it is hoped that new development will be more suitable of the urban context of the area and will provide a better mix of private and public housing to help fully integrate the community with the rest of the city. A three-year ¬£13m project to redevelop a shopping parade, community hub, health centre and homes in Butetown began in 2010. The Loudoun Square development will include environmental aspects such as harvesting rain water. The project is a collaboration between Cardiff Community Housing Association (CCHA), Cardiff Council and Cardiff and Vale University Health Board. The facilities and 62 new homes will follow four years of consultation with local residents. == Demographics == The 2011 census included the following demographic information:2011 Census Key Statistics ‚Äì Butetown ; accessed 2 February 2015. *Overall Population: 10,125 *White: 65.7% *Black: 11.3% *Asian: 9.7% *Mixed Ethnicity: 5.7% *Other Ethnic Groups: 7.7% People identifying themselves as Welsh: 42.8% ==Welsh language== The growth of the docks in the mid 19th century attracted a significant Welsh-speaking community to the area.The following two paragraphs are based on Simon Brooks, ‚ÄòTiger Bay a'r diwylliant Cymraeg‚Äô, Transactions of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion, 2009, pp. 198‚Äì216 (available on-line here ).

To serve this community three Welsh-language chapels were opened: Bethania, Loudon Square (Calvinistic Methodist; opened 1853, closed 1937); Mount Stuart (Congregationalist; opened 1858, relocated to Pomeroy Street in 1912); and Siloam, Mount Stuart Square (Baptist; opened 1860, moved to Grangetown in 1902). A Welsh-speaking Anglican church also opened in the area in 1856 (All Saints on Tyndall Street; Welsh language services moved elsewhere in 1870). One of the members of Butetown‚Äôs Welsh-speaking community was Evan Rees (Dyfed), a worker in the Bute Docks in the 1870s and a future Archdruid of Wales.Thomas Bowen, Dinas Caerdydd a'i Methodistiaeth Galfinaidd (Caerdydd, 1927), p. 81. The 1891 census showed that 15% of Butetown‚Äôs population could speak Welsh, significantly higher than the Cardiff average of 10.7%. Some parts had a particularly high percentage, such as the Loudon Square/James Street area (28%). During the 20th century, however, the percentage declined, although Welsh-speakers remained a recognised part of the local community.Neil M. C. Sinclair, The Tiger Bay Story (Cardiff, 1997), pp. 58 and 129. In the 2011 census it was recorded that 928 or 9.6% of Butetown residents (over 3 years old) could speak Welsh. This was a significant increase on the figures for the 2001 census, which were 356 and 8.3%.Welsh Language Commissioner: 2011 Census results by Community ; accessed 24 January 2015. ==Transport== Bute Street (left) and the Butetown Branch Line (right) The area is served by Cardiff Bay railway station with shuttle services every 12 minutes to Cardiff Queen Street. Cardiff Bus operates the 11 service to Pengam Green via Central station, Splott and Tremorfa and the 35 service to Gabalfa via Central Stn and Cathays. It also on the 1/2 Bay Circle route connecting the area with Grangetown, Canton, Fairwater, Llandaff, Gabalfa, Heath, Cathays, Roath, Tremorfa, Splott and the City Centre. Butetown also enjoys the incorporating Cardiff Bay, thus benefiting from its public transport opportunities such as the Baycar bus route. Bute Street and Lloyd George Avenue, running parallel, link the area to the city centre. Also, the A4232 links it to Culverhouse Cross and the M4 J33 Cardiff West to the west and to Adamsdown in the east. ==Government== Butetown is both an electoral ward, and a community of the City of Cardiff. There is no community council for the area. The electoral ward of Butetown is located in the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff South and Penarth. It is bounded by the wards of Cathays and Adamsdown to the north; Splott to the northeast; Severn estuary to the southeast; and Grangetown to the west. On Cardiff Council, the Butetown ward has been represented since 2017 by Cllr Saeed Ebrahim (Labour). ==Images of Butetown== File:Nelson House, Butetown.jpgNelson House, Butetown File:Loudoun House, Butetown.jpgLoudoun House, Butetown File:Cardiff Bay police station.jpgCardiff Bay Police Station File:Queen's Gate Tunnel.jpgQueen's Gate Tunnel (Butetown tunnel) File:The A4232 road bridge over River Taff.jpgTaff Viaduct (Butetown Link Road) File:HSBC Bank, Bute Street.jpgHSBC Bank, Bute Street File:ATW-153312-CardiffBay-02.jpgCardiff Bay railway station File:Merchant Place (Cory‚Äôs Building).jpgThe former Cory‚Äôs Building File:James Street, Cardiff.jpg James Street ==See also== * Butetown History and Art Centre * Listed buildings in Butetown * Sailortown (dockland) ==External links== * ==Notes== Category:Districts of Cardiff Category:Communities in Cardiff Category:Populated places established in the 19th century ","title":"Butetown"},{"id":"845337","text":"St Fagans ( ;G.M.

H. Auden, Stephen Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis. MacNeice's body of work was widely appreciated by the public during his lifetime, due in part to his relaxed but socially and emotionally aware style. Never as overtly or simplistically political as some of his contemporaries, he expressed a humane opposition to totalitarianism as well as an acute awareness of his roots. ==Life== ===Ireland, 1907‚Äì1917=== Plaque at site of MacNeice's childhood home in Carrickfergus Louis MacNeice (known as Freddie until his teens, when he adopted his middle name) was born in Belfast, the youngest son of John Frederick and Elizabeth Margaret (\\"Lily\\") MacNeice.Poetry Foundation profile. Both were originally from the West of Ireland. MacNeice's father, a Protestant minister, would go on to become a bishop of the Church of Ireland and his mother Elizabeth n√©e Cleshan, from Ballymacrony, County Galway, had been a schoolmistress. The family moved to Carrickfergus, County Antrim, soon after MacNeice's birth. When MacNeice was six, his mother was admitted to a Dublin nursing home suffering from severe depression and he did not see her again. She survived uterine cancer but died of tuberculosis in December 1914. MacNeice later described the cause of his mother's death as \\"obscure\\", and blamed his mother's cancer on his own difficult birth. His brother William, who had Down's syndrome, had been sent to live in an institution in Scotland during his mother's terminal illness. In 1917, his father remarried to Georgina Greer and MacNeice's sister Elizabeth was sent to board at a preparatory school at Sherborne, England. MacNeice joined her at Sherborne Preparatory School later in the year. ===School, 1917‚Äì1926=== MacNeice was generally happy at Sherborne, which gave an education concentrating on the Classics (Greek and Latin) and literature (including the memorising of poetry). He was an enthusiastic sportsman, something which continued when he moved to Marlborough College in 1921, having won a classical scholarship. Marlborough was a less happy place, with a hierarchical and sometimes cruel social structure, but MacNeice's interest in ancient literature and civilisation deepened and expanded to include Egyptian and Norse mythology. In 1922, he was invited to join Marlborough's secret 'Society of Amici'Paths of Progress: A History of Marlborough College by Rt Hon Peter Brooke MP and Thomas Hinde where he was a contemporary of John Betjeman and Anthony Blunt, forming a lifelong friendship with the latter. He also wrote poetry and essays for the school magazines. By the end of his time at the school, MacNeice was sharing a study with Blunt and also sharing his aesthetic tastes, though not his sexual ones; Blunt said MacNeice was \\"totally, irredeemably heterosexual\\". In November 1925, MacNeice was awarded a postmastership to Merton College, Oxford, and he left Marlborough in the summer of the following year. He left behind his birth name of Frederick, his accent and his father's faith, although he never lost a sense of his Irishness; (the BBC radio premiere of MacNeice's The Dark Tower in 1947, was preceded by the poet's ten-minute introduction in his distinctive Northern Irish accent.)The broadcast was repeated on BBC Radio 3 May 27, 2020, including MacNeice's introduction. ===Oxford, 1926‚Äì1930=== It was during his first year as a student at Oxford that MacNeice first met W. H. Auden, who had gained a reputation as the university's foremost poet during the preceding year. Stephen Spender and Cecil Day-Lewis were already part of Auden's circle, but MacNeice's closest Oxford friends were John Hilton, Christopher Holme and Graham Shepard, who had been with him at Marlborough. MacNeice threw himself into the aesthetic culture, publishing poetry in literary magazines The Cherwell and Sir Galahad, organising candle-lit readings of Shelley and Marlowe, and visiting Paris with Hilton. Auden would become a lifelong friend who inspired MacNeice to take up poetry seriously. In 1928 he was introduced to the Classics don John Beazley and his stepdaughter Mary Ezra. A year later he thought to soften the news that he had been arrested for drunkenness by telegraphing his father to say he was engaged to be married to Mary. John MacNeice (by now Archdeacon of Connor, and a Bishop a few years later) was horrified to discover his son was engaged to a Jew, while Ezra's family demanded assurances that Louis's brother's Down's syndrome was not hereditary. Amidst this turmoil MacNeice published four poems in Oxford Poetry, 1929 and his first undergraduate collection Blind Fireworks (1929). Published by Gollancz, the volume was dedicated to \\"Giovanna\\" (Mary's full name was Giovanna Marie Th√©r√®se Babette [1908-1991]). In 1930 the couple were married at Oxford Register Office, neither set of parents attending the ceremony. He was awarded a first-class degree in literae humaniores, and had already gained an appointment as Assistant Lecturer in Classics at the University of Birmingham. ===Birmingham, 1930‚Äì1936=== The newlyweds were found lodgings in Birmingham by E. R. Dodds and his wife, Bet ‚Äì Dodds was Professor of Greek (and later to be MacNeice's literary executor). Bet was a lecturer in the Department of English. The MacNeices lived in a former coachman's cottage in the grounds of a house in Selly Park belonging to another professor, Philip Sargant Florence. Birmingham was a very different university (and city) from Oxford, MacNeice was not a natural lecturer, and he found it difficult to write poetry. He turned instead to a semi- autobiographical novel, Roundabout Way, which was published in 1932 under the name of Louis Malone as he feared a novel by an academic would not be favourably reviewed. He felt that married life was not helping his poetry: \\"To write poems expressing doubt or melancholy, an anarchist conception of freedom or nostalgia for the open spaces (and these were the things that I wanted to express), seemed disloyal to Mariette. Instead I was disloyal to myself, wrote a novel which purported to be an idyll of domestic felicity. As we predicted, the novel was not well received.\\" The local Classical Association included George Augustus Auden, Professor of Public Health and father of W. H. Auden, and by 1932 MacNeice and Auden's Oxford acquaintance had turned into a close friendship. Auden knew many Marxists, and Blunt had also become a communist by this time, but MacNeice, although sympathetic to the left, was always sceptical of easy answers and \\"the armchair reformist\\". The Strings are False (written at the time of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact) describes his wish for a change in society and even revolution, but also his intellectual opposition to Marxism and especially the communism embraced by many of his friends. MacNeice started to write poetry again, and in January 1933 he and Auden led the first edition of Geoffrey Grigson's magazine New Verse. MacNeice also started sending poems to T. S. Eliot at around this time, and although Eliot did not feel that they merited Faber and Faber publishing a volume of poems, several were published in Eliot's journal The Criterion. On 15 May 1934, Louis and Mary's son Daniel John MacNeice was born. In September of that year, MacNeice travelled to Dublin with Dodds, who had republican sympathies, and met William Butler Yeats. Unsuccessful attempts at playwriting and another novel were followed in September 1935 by Poems, the first of his collections for Faber and Faber, who would remain his publishers. This helped establish MacNeice as one of the new poets of the 1930s. In November, Mary left MacNeice and their infant son for a Russian-American graduate student called Charles Katzmann who had been staying with the family. MacNeice engaged a nurse to look after Dan, and his sister and stepmother also helped on occasion. In early 1936, Blunt and MacNeice visited Spain, shortly after the election of the Popular Front government. Auden and MacNeice travelled to Iceland in the summer of that year, which resulted in Letters from Iceland, a collection of poems, letters (some in verse) and essays. In October, MacNeice left Birmingham for a lecturing post in the Department of Greek at Bedford College for Women, part of the University of London. ===London, 1936‚Äì1940=== MacNeice was featured in two high-profile collections of modernist poetry of 1936. The Faber Book of Modern Verse, edited by young writer and critic Michael Roberts, collected work published after 1910, printing MacNeice's '\\"An Eclogue for Christmas\\", \\"Sunday Morning\\", \\"Perseus\\", \\"The Creditor\\" and \\"Snow\\" towards the end of the roughly chronological book.Korte, Schneider and Lethbridge (2000), Anthologies of British Poetry: Critical Perspectives from Literary and Cultural Studies, Faber Book of Modern Verse (1936). Editions Rodopi B.V. pp. 156‚Äì164 In the book, MacNeice is set in amongst others of the new Auden Group, presenting a version of modernism in which Eliot is the star. MacNeice and his group were also featured in Oxford Book of Modern Verse 1892‚Äì1935, edited by Yeats. This collection generally excluded American poets and was less well received critically, but instantaneously became a best-seller. MacNeice moved into Geoffrey Grigson's former flat in Hampstead with Daniel and his nurse. His translation of Aeschylus's Agamemnon was published in late 1936, and produced by the Group Theatre. Shortly afterwards his divorce from Mary was finalised. They continued to write frequent affectionate letters to one another, although Mary married Katzmann shortly after the divorce. MacNeice started an affair with Nancy Coldstream. Nancy was, like her husband Bill, a painter and a friend of Auden who had introduced the couple to MacNeice while they were in Birmingham. MacNeice and Nancy visited the Hebrides in 1937, which resulted in a book of prose and verse written by MacNeice with illustrations by Nancy, I Crossed the Minch.On p157 of 'I Crossed The Minch' MacNeice writes that he wrote 'Leaving Barra' (Poems, 1937) sitting on a deck-chair in the stern of a ship. The closing verses and particularly the closing line of this poem, \\"While you are alive beyond question, Like the dazzle on the sea, my darling.\\" fits with his writing in 'The Strings Are False', p171, about spending time in 1937 with someone \\"of all the people I have known she could be the most radiant.\\" He also writes that she \\"could be as gloomy as to black-out London,\\" but that \\"I do not regret the hours and hours of argument and melancholy, the unanswerable lamentations of someone who wanted to be happy in a way that was just not practical.\\" August 1937 saw the appearance of Letters from Iceland (which had been finished by the two authors in MacNeice's London home the previous year), and towards the end of the year a play called Out of the Picture was published and produced by the Group Theatre. Music was written for the production by Benjamin Britten, as he had done previously for Agamemnon. In 1938, Faber and Faber published a second collection of poems, The Earth Compels, the Oxford University Press published Modern Poetry, and Nancy once again contributed illustrations to a book about London Zoo, called simply Zoo. As the year ‚Äì and his relationship with Nancy ‚Äì drew to a close, he started work on Autumn Journal. By Christmas, Nancy was in love with Stephen Spender's brother Michael, whom she was later to marry, and at the end of the year MacNeice visited Barcelona shortly before the city fell to Franco. The poem was finished by February 1939, and published in May. It is widely viewed as MacNeice's masterpiece, recording his feelings as the Spanish Civil War raged and the United Kingdom headed towards war with Germany, as well as his personal concerns and reflections over the past decade. During the Easter holiday that year, MacNeice made a brief lecture tour of various American universities, also meeting Mary and Charles Katzmann and giving a reading with Auden and Christopher Isherwood in New York attended by John Berryman, and at which Auden met Chester Kallman for the first time. MacNeice also met the writer Eleanor Clark in New York, and arranged to spend the next academic year on sabbatical so that he could be with her. A lectureship at Cornell University was organised, and in December 1939 MacNeice sailed for America, leaving his son in Ireland. Cornell proved a success but the relationship with Eleanor did not, and MacNeice was back in London by the end of 1940. Faber and Faber published Selected Poems in March 1940, which contained 20 poems drawn from Poems 1935, The Earth Compels and Autumn Journal. It went through six impressions by 1945. MacNeice worked as a freelance journalist (he had resigned from his lecturing position at Bedford College while in America) and was awaiting the publication of Plant and Phantom, which was dedicated to Clark (the previous year, the Cuala Press had published The Last Ditch, a limited edition containing some poems that would appear in the new volume). In early 1941, MacNeice was employed by the BBC. ===War and after, 1941‚Äì1963=== MacNeice's work for the BBC initially involved writing and producing radio programmes intended to build support for the US, and later Russia ‚Äì cultural programmes emphasising links between the countries rather than outright propaganda. A critical work on W. B. Yeats (on which he had been working since the poet's death in 1939) was published early in 1941, as were Plant and Phantom and Poems 1925‚Äì1940 (an American anthology). At the end of the year, MacNeice started a relationship with Hedli Anderson and they were married in July 1942, three months after the death of his father. Brigid Corinna MacNeice (known by her second name like her parents, or as \\"Bimba\\") was born a year later. By the end of the war MacNeice had written well over sixty scripts for the BBC and a further collection of poems, Springboard. The radio play Christopher Columbus, produced in 1942 and later published as a book, featured music by William Walton, conducted by Adrian Boult, and starred Laurence Olivier. 1943's He Had a Date (loosely based on the life and death of MacNeice's friend Graham Shepard but also semi-autobiographical) was also published, as was The Dark Tower (1946, again with music by Britten). Dylan Thomas acted in some of MacNeice's plays during this period, and the two poets, both heavy drinkers, also became social companions. In 1947, the BBC sent MacNeice to report on Indian independence and partition, and he continued to produce plays for the corporation, including a six-part radio adaptation of Goethe's Faust in 1949. 1948's collection of poems, Holes in the Sky, met with a less favourable reception than previous books. In 1950 he was given eighteen months' leave to become Director of the British Institute in Athens, run by the British Council. Patrick Leigh Fermor had previously been Deputy Director of the Institute, and he and his future wife, the Honourable Joan Elizabeth Rayner (n√©e Eyres Monsell), became close friends of the MacNeices. Ten Burnt Offerings, poems written in Greece, were broadcast by the BBC in 1951 and published the following year. The family returned to England in August 1951, and Dan (who had been at an English boarding school) left for America in early 1952 to stay with his mother, to avoid national service. Dan would return to England in 1953, but went to live permanently with his mother after a legal battle with MacNeice. In 1953, MacNeice wrote Autumn Sequel, a long autobiographical poem in terza rima, which critics compared unfavourably with Autumn Journal. The death of Dylan Thomas came partway through the writing of the poem, and MacNeice involved himself in memorials for the poet and attempts to raise money for his family. 1953 and 1954 brought lecture and performance tours of the USA (husband and wife would present an evening of song, monologue and poetry readings), and meetings with John Berryman (on the returning boat in 1953, and later in London) and Eleanor Clark (by now married to Robert Penn Warren). MacNeice travelled to Egypt in 1955 and Ghana in 1956 on lengthy assignments for the BBC. Another poorly received collection of poems, Visitations, was published in 1957, and the MacNeices bought a holiday home on the Isle of Wight from J. B. Priestley (an acquaintance since MacNeice's arrival in London twenty years earlier). However, the marriage was starting to become strained. MacNeice was drinking increasingly heavily, and having more or less serious affairs with other women. At this time MacNeice became increasingly independent of spirit, spending time with other writers, including Dominic Behan with whom he regularly drank to oblivion; the two men spent a particularly drunken night in the home of Cecil Woodham-Smith during a curious meeting in Ireland whilst Behan was working on assignment as a writer for Life magazine and MacNeice on assignment with the BBC. During the trip, which allegedly lasted some weeks, neither writer managed successfully to file their copy. MacNeice was buried at Carrowdore with his mother MacNeice was awarded the CBE in the 1958 New Year's Honours list. A South African trip in 1959 was followed by the start of his final relationship, with the actress Mary Wimbush, who had performed in his plays since the forties. Hedli asked MacNeice to leave the family home in late 1960. In early 1961, Solstices was published, and in the middle of the year MacNeice became a half-time employee at the BBC, leaving him six months a year to work on his own projects. By this time he was \\"living on alcohol\\", and eating very little, but still writing (including a commissioned work on astrology, which he viewed as \\"hack-work\\"). In August 1963 he went caving in Yorkshire to gather sound effects for his final radio play, Persons from Porlock. Caught in a storm on the moors, he did not change out of his wet clothes until he was home in Hertfordshire. Bronchitis evolved into viral pneumonia, and he was admitted to hospital in London on 27 August, dying there on 3 September, aged 55. He was buried in Carrowdore churchyard in County Down, with his mother. His final book of poems, The Burning Perch, was published a few days after his funeral ‚Äì Auden, who gave a reading at MacNeice's memorial service, described the poems of his last two years as \\"among his very best\\". ==Influence== MacNeice wrote in the introduction to his Autumn Journal, \\"Poetry in my opinion must be honest before anything else and I refuse to be 'objective' or clear-cut at the cost of honesty.\\" He has inspired many poets since his death, particularly those from Northern Ireland such as Paul Muldoon and Michael Longley. There has been a movement to reclaim him as an Irish writer rather than a satellite of Auden.K. Devine and A. J. Peacock, Louis MacNeice and His Influence, Longley has edited two selections of his work, and Muldoon gives more space to MacNeice than to any other author in his Faber Book of Contemporary Irish Poetry, which covers the period from the death of W. B. Yeats until 1986. Muldoon and Derek Mahon have both written elegies for MacNeice, Mahon's coming after a pilgrimage to the poet's grave in the company of Longley and Seamus Heaney in 1965. At the time of MacNeice's death, John Berryman described him as \\"one of my best friends\\", and wrote an elegy in Dream Song #267. ==Archive== Louis MacNeice's archive was established at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin in 1964, a year after MacNeice's death. The collection, largely coming from MacNeice's sister Elizabeth Nicholson, includes manuscripts of poetic and dramatic works, a large number of books, correspondence, and books from MacNeice's library. ==Works== ===Poetry collections=== * Blind Fireworks (1929, mainly considered by MacNeice to be juvenilia and excluded from the 1949 Collected Poems) * Poems (1935) * Letters from Iceland (1937, with W.

Variants of it were manufactured from 1920 until 1982. It is composed of sheet-metal sliders inside a metal envelope, manipulated by a stylus, with an innovative carry mechanism, doing subtract ten, carry one with a simple stylus movement. Some types of Addiators can also handle negative numbers (via a complementary bottom window or by providing a subtraction mode on the back side of the device). Only made obsolete by the electronic variety, it was simple and cheap for the time. It also handles non- decimal measurements, like feet and inches, or pre-decimalization pounds, shillings, and pence. Addition and subtraction require different 'screens', handled by turning the instrument over, or flipping a front panel, or, later, by extended sliders and an extra lower panel. Although not always advertised (e.g. the Magic Brain Calculator mentions \\"add, subtract, multiply\\" on its front plate), procedures exist for multiplication (by repeated addition or by individual digit multiplications) and division (eg by repeated subtraction, or use of additions combined with complementary numbers). More expensive versions have a built-in slide rule on the back. This type of calculator was introduced by the Frenchman Troncet in 1889. The Addiator was one of the most popular calculators of this sort, and the name is often used to refer to the type generally. ==See also== *Calculator *History of computing hardware * Pascaline == External links == * http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/addiator.html * http://www.addiator.de Addiator museum * http://www.calculators.de calculator museum * http://www.peterkernwein.de/Rechengeraete- Sammlung/addiator_universal.htm Addiators and many other calculators * http://www.tcocd.de/index.shtml Collection of calculating devices * http://www.rechnerlexikon.de/en/artikel/Addiator * Addiator photos and manuals hosted at www.computercollector.com * Addiator photos * Addiator Hexadat Programmers Calculator * https://issuu.com/keesnagtegaal/docs/catalogue-2015-1.3 A catalog showing photographs of dozens of different models Category:Mechanical calculators ","title":"Addiator"},{"id":"845369","text":"XTERRA is a series of cross triathlon races, i.e. three-sport races which include swimming, mountain biking, and trail running. The XTERRA Global Tour is owned and produced by TEAM Unlimited. The XTERRA race series is the best- known series of cross triathlons, and is considered by most to be the de facto world championship of the sport. It began in 1996 on the Hawaiian island of Maui as the Aquaterra, and was later renamed the XTERRA. Japanese automaker Nissan licensed the name from the triathlon series for their own 1999-2015 sport utility vehicle -- and was the race series' primary sponsor from 1998 to 2006, when the two companies parted ways. ==Organization== The XTERRA has two primary divisions, professional and \\"age-groupers\\". In the professional division athletes compete for cash prizes and sponsorships. The age-group division was created for those who still want to compete but have no aspirations to become professional athletes. Both divisions compete in a points series, where athletes accumulate points by placing in the top fifteen positions of any race in which they compete. Several events known as XTERRA Championships Series offer more points due to their larger draws. In the United States, there are championships for each region of the country. These venues also offer a \\"sport\\" version of the race where contestants complete races that are typically half the distance of the full version. == Race format == As an off-road race, the distances can vary widely depending on the terrain available. The target distances are as follows: *Championship/pro: 1.5 km swim, 30 km mountain biking, 11 km trail run *Sport: 500 m swim, 15 km mountain biking, 5 km trail Run The largest difference between the XTERRA race and a regular Triathlon is in the biking section. Though less than the standard 40k distance (in a regular Triathlon), XTERRA has steeper, more aggressive inclines for a shorter distance, usually between 27-30k, over rough terrain. In the United States the sport distances are often used as miles yielding a 1/2 mile (805 m) swim, 15 mile (24 km) mountain bike, and a 5-mile (8-km) trail run. == See also == *Duathlon *Triathlon == References == ==External links== *Official XTERRA Website Category:Multisports Category:Triathlon competitions Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1996 ","title":"XTERRA Triathlon"},{"id":"845372","text":"PRL may refer to: ==Places== * Polish People's Republic (Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa), 1952-1989 ==Business and enterprises== * Penn Eastern Rail Lines, reporting mark ==Computing and technology== * Preferred Roaming List, in CDMA phones * Proportional reduction in loss, a measure of reliability * Protocol- relative link, URLs which do not specify a protocol ==Organizations== * Liberal Reformist Party (Dominican Republic) * Parti R√©formateur Lib√©ral, a former political party in Belgium * Republican Party of Liberty, a conservative political party in France, 1945-1951 ==Science and healthcare== * Physical Research Laboratory, India * Physical Review Letters, a scientific journal * PRL-8-53, Nootropic research chemical * Prolactin, a hormone ","title":"PRL"},{"id":"845382","text":"Martin Newland (born 26 October 1961) is a British journalist, a former Editor of The Daily Telegraph who now consults on media and communications, most recently in the Middle East. He was an advisor to Abu Dhabi Media and before that was Executive Director Publishing, Abu Dhabi Media. Prior to that, he was launch Editor of The National, a national newspaper in Abu Dhabi. Before that, he was editor of The Daily Telegraph, a British broadsheet newspaper, from 2003 to 2005, replacing Charles Moore. Newland was appointed Editor upon his return from Canada where he was a launch editor and Deputy Editor of Conrad Black's new national newspaper The National Post. The launch of the Post started one of the most costly and intense newspaper wars in North America. ==Education== Newland was educated at Downside School, the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Goldsmith's College at the University of London, where he took a BA in History and Heythrop College (also at the University of London), where he took an MA in Theology. ==Life and career== Newland worked to preserve The Daily Telegraph when it was purchased in June 2004 from Hollinger International by the Barclay brothers, owners of The Scotsman newspaper and The Business magazine. After the takeover, it was confirmed that Newland would remain as editor under the new owners, despite some reports that he would be replaced by Dominic Lawson, editor of the Sunday Telegraph, and others such as Andrew Neil, publisher of The Scotsman and The Business. Newland was opposed to introducing a compact (tabloid) version of The Daily Telegraph but was known to want to introduce some changes to the broadsheet. Newland resigned as Daily Telegraph editor on 18 November 2005. His temporary replacement was confirmed as John Bryant, the Telegraph Group's newly appointed Editor-in- Chief. Bryant was never officially editor of the Daily Telegraph, a much- coveted office previously held by the likes of Lord Deedes and Max Hastings. In August 2007, Press Gazette reported that Newland was due to launch a new newspaper in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates.

Prior to becoming editor of The Daily Telegraph, he worked at the Catholic Herald from 1986 to 1989; then became a reporter and home editor on The Daily Telegraph (1989‚Äì98). He was deputy editor on the National Post, a conservative Canadian daily founded in 1998 by Lord Black of Crossharbour. Under Newland's news direction, the upstart daily found a distinctive voice and quickly came to within striking distance of the venerable, but colourless The Globe and Mail, before mounting losses forced major cutbacks in editorial staffing levels.

The film was nominated for three Academy Awards, and won two: Best Cinematography (Black and White) (Joseph Ruttenberg) and Best Art Direction (Black and White) (Cedric Gibbons, Malcolm Brown, Edwin B. Willis, F. Keogh Gleason). It lost its nomination for Best Film Editing to Around the World in 80 Days. ==Plot== Rocky Graziano (Paul Newman) has a difficult childhood and is beaten by his father. He joins a street gang, and undergoes a long history of criminal activities. He is sent to prison, where he is rebellious to all authority figures. After his release, he is drafted by the U.S. Army, but runs away. Needing money, he becomes a boxer, and finds that he has natural talent and wins six fights in a row before the Army finds him and dishonorably discharges him. He serves a year in a United States Disciplinary Barracks, and resumes his career as a boxer as a result. While working his way to the title, he is introduced to his sister's friend Norma, whom he falls in love with and later marries. Starting a new, clean life, he rises to the top, but loses a title fight with Tony Zale (Court Shepard). A person he knew in prison finds him and blackmails him into throwing a fight over his dishonorable discharge. Rocky fakes an injury and avoids the fight altogether. When he is interrogated by the district attorney, he refuses to name the blackmailer and has his license suspended. His manager gets him a fight in Chicago to fight Zale the middleweight champion, once more.

In 2017 Shore was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history. Shore won the Hart Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player four times, the most of any defenceman; only Wayne Gretzky and Gordie Howe have won it more often. After the league began naming NHL All-Star Teams at the end of Shore's fifth season, Shore was honoured as a First Team All-Star in seven of his last nine seasons, while being named a Second Team All-Star one of the other seasons; in the remaining season he missed over half the schedule due to injury. A bruiser known for his violence, Shore set a then-NHL record for 165 penalty minutes in his second season. ==Playing career== Shore with the Melville Millionaires. Ace Bailey (left) shakes the hand of Eddie Shore at the benefit All-Star Game held in honour of Bailey. Shore started his career with his hometown minor hockey team in Cupar, the Cupar Canucks. He played for the Melville Millionaires and won the 1923-24 Saskatchewan senior championship. Shore moved up to professional hockey with the Regina Capitals of the Western Canada Hockey League in 1925. His team finished last in the league and moved to Portland after the season. Shore moved to the league champion Edmonton Eskimos in 1926, where he converted from forward to defence and was given the nickname \\"the Edmonton Express\\". When the Western Hockey League (renamed from the WCHL) folded in 1926, Shore was sold to the Boston Bruins of the NHL. As a rookie, he scored 12 goals and six assists for a total of 18 points and accumulated 130 penalty minutes. Shore helped the Bruins win their first Stanley Cup in 1929. In the 1925‚Äì26 season, Billy Coutu and Sprague Cleghorn of the Montreal Canadiens were traded to the Boston Bruins. During their first practice with the Bruins, Shore strutted back and forth in front of Coutu and Cleghorn. Coutu body-slammed, head-butted, elbowed and tried to torment Shore. Next Coutu picked up the puck and made a rush at Shore. The two players collided. Shore held his ground and Coutu flew through the air violently crashing to the ice. Shore's ear was almost ripped off but he barely noticed it. Coutu was out cold and was out of commission for a week. Shore visited several doctors who wanted to amputate the ear, but found one who sewed it back on. After refusing anesthetic, Shore used a mirror to watch the doctor sew the ear on. Shore claimed Coutu used his hockey stick to cut off the ear, and Coutu was fined $50. Shore later recanted and Coutu's money was refunded. Another unusual incident involving Shore occurred in January 1930 when he was challenged to a boxing match by baseball player Art Shires. While NHL President Frank Calder said that Shore's participation was up to Bruins' manager Art Ross to decide, baseball commissioner Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis vetoed Shires' participation, and the match was never held. On January 24, 1933, during a game against Montreal, Shore accidentally punched NHL referee-in-chief Cooper Smeaton during a fight with Sylvio Mantha and was fined $100. In Boston Garden on December 12, 1933, Shore ended the career of Toronto Maple Leafs star Ace Bailey when he hit Bailey from behind. When Bailey's head hit the ice, he was knocked unconscious and went into convulsions. Moments earlier, Maple Leafs teammate King Clancy upended Shore with a hard check as he rushed up the ice. Angry, dazed, and thinking he was going after Clancy, Shore rushed at Bailey intent on revenge. In retaliation, the Leafs tough-guy Red Horner punched Shore, whose head hit the ice as he fell from the blow. Shore was knocked unconscious and required seven stitches but was not seriously injured. Bailey was rushed to hospital in critical condition with a fractured skull and was operated on for more than four hours. There were many fears that he could possibly die. He came out of a coma for the second time 10 days later, making a full recovery, but he did not play professionally again. When he was assured that Bailey would survive, league president Frank Calder suspended Shore for 16 games. An all-star benefit game was held at Maple Leaf Gardens on February 14, 1934, which raised $20,909 for Bailey and his family. Bailey and Shore shook hands and embraced at centre ice before the game began. Thirteen years later, the NHL introduced an annual all-star game. Shore and the Bruins won their second Stanley Cup in 1939. Shore retired and bought the Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League, where he was player-owner in 1939‚Äì40. He was persuaded to rejoin the Bruins after injuries to the Bruins' defence corps, with an agreement that he would play in home games for $200 per match. Shore played just four games for Boston, and was reported as being unenthusiastic about the arrangement. Obtaining permission to play in the Indians' home games, he began to agitate to play in Springfield road games as well, which provoked his trade to the New York Americans on January 25, 1940, for Eddie Wiseman and $5000. He stayed with the Americans through their elimination from the playoffs, and was simultaneously playing with the Indians in their playoff games. Shore's final NHL game was March 24 against the Detroit Red Wings, which coincidentally was also the final NHL game for Hall of Famer and teammate Nels Stewart. In February 1940, Shore and eight other arena managers organized the Ice Capades. ==Retirement and the Indians== Eddie Shore in Springfield, Massachusetts Although Shore had played his last NHL game, he played two more seasons in Springfield. The Indians halted operations during World War II, and Shore moved his players to Buffalo where he coached the Buffalo Bisons of the AHL to the Calder Cup championship in 1943 and 1944. After the war, the Springfield Indians resumed play in 1946 and Shore returned. As an owner, Shore could be cantankerous and was often accused of treating players with little respect. He commonly had players who had been out of the lineup perform maintenance in the Eastern States Coliseum, the Indians' home, referring to them as \\"Black Aces\\". Today, the term is commonly used to refer to extra players on the roster who train with the team in case of injury. Despite this, the Indians prospered under his ownership, making the playoffs 12 times and winning three Calder Cups in a row from 1960 to 1962. During the 1967 season, the entire Indians team refused to play after Shore suspended three players without pay, including future NHL star Bill White, for what he said was \\"indifferent play\\". When the team asked for an explanation, Shore suspended the two players who spoke for the team, one of whom was Brian Kilrea. Alan Eagleson, then a little-known lawyer and sometime politician, was brought in to negotiate with Shore on the players' behalf. The battle escalated for months, ending with Shore giving up day-to-day operation of the club to the Los Angeles Kings; the genesis of the National Hockey League Players' Association stems from that incident. Shore took back full control of the team in 1974, changed its name back to the Indians and restored its traditional blue-white-red scheme. He continued to own the team until he sold it in 1976. For his contributions to the game of hockey, Eddie Shore was awarded the vanity license plate \\"MR HOCKEY\\" by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. On March 15, 1985, Shore was visiting his son in Springfield, Massachusetts. That night, Shore began coughing up and vomiting blood and was later rushed to the hospital. He was pronounced dead the next morning and the cause of death was later determined to be liver cancer. His funeral was held in his hometown five days later. He is buried in Hillcrest Park Cemetery in the Sixteen Acres section of Springfield. Shore was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1947. The Boston Bruins retired his number 2. The Eddie Shore Award is given annually to the AHL's best defenceman. In 1998 he was ranked number 10 on The Hockey News' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players, making him the highest-ranked pre-World War II player. ==Cultural references== In the film Slap Shot, Eddie Shore's name, along with Toe Blake and Dit Clapper, is considered synonymous with 'Old-time hockey'. Shore is also featured in the Don Cherry biopic, Keep Your Head Up Kid: The Don Cherry Story where he was portrayed by Stephen McHattie. ==Awards and achievements== *Stanley Cup winner in 1929 and 1939. * Named to the WHL First All-Star Team 1926. * Won the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL's Most Valuable Player in 1933, 1935, 1936, 1938. * Named to the NHL First All-Star Team in 1931, 1932, 1933, 1935, 1936, 1938, 1939. * Named to the NHL Second All-Star Team in 1934. * Won the Lester B.

Aksu's influence on Turkish pop and world music has continued since her debut in 1975, and has been reinforced by her patronage of and collaboration with many other musicians, including Sertab Erener, ≈ûebnem Ferah, A≈ükƒ±n Nur Yengi, Hande Yener, Yƒ±ldƒ±z Tilbe, I≈üƒ±n Karaca, Seden G√ºrel, Harun Kol√ßak and Levent Y√ºksel. Sezen Aksu is widely known as a successful songwriter. Her work with Tarkan resulted in continental hits like \\"≈ûƒ±marƒ±k\\" and \\"≈ûƒ±kƒ±dƒ±m\\" and her collaboration with Goran Bregoviƒá widened her international audience. In 2010, NPR named her as one of the \\"50 Great Voices\\" of the world. == Biography == Sezen Aksu was born in Sarayk√∂y, Denizli, Turkey. Her father was a mathematics teacher. Her family moved to Bergama when she was three years old and she spent her childhood and early youth there. Aksu's parents discouraged her singing because they wanted her to have a steady profession as a doctor or engineer. She used to wait until they left the house and sing on the family's balcony. After finishing high school, she began studying at the local agricultural institute, but left college to concentrate on music. Along with her close friend Ajda Pekkan, Aksu is credited with laying the foundations of Turkish pop music in the 1970s.Aksu's expressive vocal technique, distinctive songwriting, and prolific output were all integral to her success and to the development of a unique Turkish pop sound. Many musicians--for example, Alexander Hacke and several of the artists he interviewed for the documentary Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul --have acknowledged Sezen Aksu's broad influence. Her sound has also spread across the Balkans and Greece.With the Greek diaspora from Turkey in the seventies, many brought their musical tastes, which included Aksu's music to Greece; the Greek musicians Haris Alexiou and Giorgos Dalaras acknowledge her influence. Aksu has also toured in Europe and the U.S to critical appraise. She has championed a variety of causes, including support for constitutional reform, minority rights, women's rights, the environment, and educational reform in Turkey. Aksu has been married and divorced four times, but kept the name from her second marriage to Ali Engin Aksu, a doctor of geology who currently resides in Canada. She has a son with Sinan √ñzer, named Mithat Can, who is also a lead vocalist of Pist'on band. == Career == ===1975‚Äì1983: Early life and career beginnings=== Sezen Aksu released her first single, Haydi ≈ûansƒ±m/Gel Bana in 1975 under the name of \\"Sezen Seley\\". However, she remained undiscovered until her 1976 single Olmaz Olsun/Vurdumduymaz reached number one in the Turkish charts. In 1976, Sezen Aksu won the \\"Promising Female Artist of the Year\\" award. Her first album was 1978's Ser√ße, which earned her a famous nickname, first penned by a Turkish journalist. Aksu finally decided to represent Turkey at the Eurovision Song Contest in the mid-70s. However, even though she competed in the national finals for the competition three times, with K√º√ß√ºk Bir A≈ük Masalƒ± (A Little Love Tale) as a duet with √ñzdemir Erdoƒüan, \\"Heyamola\\" which was performed as a trio with Co≈ükun Demir and Ali Kocatepe, and 1945 which was a solo performance, she did not get the chance to represent Turkey abroad. It was to be left to her pupil, Sertab Erener, to win the Eurovision and realise Aksu's dream to push her musical vision further into Europe. ===1980s=== In the 80's, Aksu had a relationship with producer Onno Tun√ß that was both romantic and professional. As a couple they put their signatures to works that broke new ground in Turkish pop music, such as Sen Aƒülama, Git, Sezen Aksu'88 and Sezen Aksu S√∂yl√ºyor. Her music matured in the 90's, when she co-produced her best selling album to-date G√ºl√ºmse with Tun√ß. The A-1 track from the album called Hadi Bakalƒ±m was a hit in Turkey and Europe, and was published as a single in Germany. It was to be later rediscovered in Europop by singer Loona as Rhythm of the Night. She also began to produce albums for her vocalists, notably producing A≈ükƒ±n Nur Yengi's debut album Sevgiliye (To a Lover) again with Tun√ß. She was to repeat her success as a teacher with artists Sertab Erener and Levent Y√ºksel. ===1990s‚Äìpresent=== Parting ways with Tun√ß, in 1995, Aksu branched out with the experimental album I≈üƒ±k Doƒüudan Y√ºkselir, drawing both on western classical and regional Turkish musical traditions. This album made her name known outside Turkey and gave her a worldwide audience, especially in Europe. In 1996, she released D√º≈ü Bah√ßeleri as a tribute to Tun√ß, who died that same year tragically when his private plane crashed. In 1997, she released D√ºƒü√ºn ve Cenaze, this time collaborating with Goran Bregovic. She returned to her roots with Adƒ± Bende Saklƒ±, which was released in 1998. She began to use experimental sounds and was once again pushing Turkish pop into the future. Aksu continued with this trend with her subsequent albums Deliveren, ≈ûarkƒ± S√∂ylemek Lazƒ±m (which also featured former Sparks bassist Martin Gordon as engineer/mixer, who also was bass player on her subsequent European tour), and Yaz Bitmeden between the years 2000‚Äì2003. After a two-year hiatus, she returned with Bahane in 2005. That same year she released Kardelen, where all proceeds went to charity, and before the end of 2005 released a Bahane/Remixes double-CD album, which contained the original Bahane album in disc one and the remixes of songs in disc two.

In 2009 she refused to support Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan's democratic initiative, and supported the settlement process in Turkey.

Aksu is keen to fight against issues such as misogyny, illiteracy, discrimination, bullying and homophobia. According to the LGBT magazine, KAOS GL, she is a major gay icon, with the Turkish LGBT community embracing her as a pop culture representative. In 2002, alongside Ajda Pekkan and Seyyal Taner, Aksu was named as one of the gay icons admired by the Turkish LGBT people in the book E≈ücinsel Erkekler by Murat Hocaoƒülu.

In 2008, she supported LGBT association Lambdaistanbul, which was closed by a court decision based on \\"the fact that it is contrary to general morality\\". In 2013, Aksu performed with transsexual actress Ayta S√∂zeri on stage, and later a huge rainbow flag symbolizing the LGBT movement was waved in the air, the first time that a Turkish artist had publicly shown support for LGBT on stage. Later in 2013, she published a statement on her official website in support of the SPOD (Social Policy Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation Studies Association) on its first anniversary. In her statement, she mentioned Mesut ≈ûaban Okan, nicknamed \\"ƒ∞rem\\", who was a victim of hate crime in Bursa in 2010. Referencing Melek Okan's words about her child's death, who had said \\"They could not find a place for my child anywhere in the whole world!\\", Aksu talked about violence against LGBT people and added that she would fight against violence and discrimination. 266854 Sezenaksu, a meteorite discovered in 2009, is named after the artist. == Personal life == Sezen Aksu married Hasan Y√ºksektepe at a young age, and the two got divorced shortly afterwards.

In the ship's 34 years of service, she completed 19 deployments in the western Pacific and became the most decorated dock landing ship on the west coast. ==Construction== Anchorage was awarded to Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi on 29 June 1965 and her keel was laid down on 13 March 1967. She was launched on 5 May 1968; sponsored by Mrs. Alexander S. Heyward, Jr., the wife of Vice Admiral Alexander S. Heyward; and commissioned at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia, on 15 March 1969, Captain Percy Stuart Beaman in command. Outfitted with a large floodable stern section accessed through an enormous operable stern gate, Anchorage served as a launch platform for large landing craft, such as the LCU, as well as a \\"boat haven\\" to shelter other small craft utilized in an amphibious landing. The ship was able to provide a minimal degree of naval gunfire support through the use of two sets of twin /50 caliber guns mounted on the 02-level fore and aft. In later years these guns were removed to be replaced with Mk-38 machine guns and two Phalanx CIWS for missile defense. In its final decade of service with the US Navy, it functioned primarily as a platform for two LCAC hovercraft landing vehicles and embarked Marines. ==Service history== After a brief, round-trip cruise to Andros Island, Bahamas, the Anchorage left Norfolk on 24 June, bound for the west coast. She paused at Mayport and Fort Lauderdale, Florida; transited the Panama Canal on 16 July; and arrived at her home port San Diego, California, on 26 July. At the end of shakedown training off the California coast, she entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California, on 1 November, for post-shakedown availability. ===Pacific ‚Äì Far East service=== ====1970==== Anchorage participated in numerous military operations. At the end of the Vietnam War, the ship carried Marines back to the United States as a part of the US withdrawal from Vietnam. Anchorage returned to San Diego on 9 January 1970. She set sail on the 31st for the western Pacific (WestPac) to transport Marine Corps personnel back to the United States as part of Operation Keystone Bluejay, a planned withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam. On 19 February, the ship arrived at Danang, Republic of Vietnam; took on board the personnel and equipment of the 7th Motor Battalion; and sailed for the United States. She reached Delmar, California, on 12 March and debarked her passengers. Following a month and one-half in port at San Diego for training and upkeep, Anchorage got underway on 1 May with other units of Amphibious Squadron (PhibRon) 5 for the Far East. She stopped at Pearl Harbor and then sailed to Johnston Atoll to deliver several landing craft. The ship next proceeded to Yokosuka, Japan, and arrived there on 19 May for voyage repairs. Her next port call was at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, where Marines came on board for transportation to Subic Bay, Philippines. Upon the completion of that embarkation, PhibRon 5 units assumed duty as Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) Alfa. From 6 to 18 June, Anchorage carried small craft between ports along the coast of Vietnam. Her ports of call included Vung Tau, Camranh Bay, Qui Nhon, Danang, and An Thoi, near Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc. She anchored near An Thoi from 11 to 14 June to provide dry dock services for the ships at the naval activity there. On 22 June, the ship participated in the first of several amphibious exercises conducted by ARG Alfa at Green Beach, near Subic Bay. During these operations, she acted as a primary control ship for the direction and control of landing craft while they moved to the beach. The ship pulled into Sasebo, Japan, early in July for a period of rest and relaxation for the crew. She got underway again on 16 July for amphibious exercises off Green Beach. On the 31st, she arrived at Okinawa to take Battalion Landing Team 2/9 on board for transportation to Subic Bay. Anchorage arrived at Subic Bay on 18 August for upkeep. Her next port of call was Hong Kong, which she visited from 10 until 18 September and then returned to the Subic Bay operating area. From 24 September through 8 October, Anchorage traveled among Subic Bay and Vung Tau, Camranh Bay and Danang, Vietnam, carrying various small craft. Late in October, she carried out relief operations in the Lagonoy Gulf on the eastern coast of the Philippines for victims of Typhoons Joan and Kate. After touching at Keelung, Taiwan, on 29 October, the ship proceeded to Okinawa to pick up a landing craft for transportation to Subic Bay. She took part in amphibious exercises at Green Beach on 7 November, then put into port at Subic Bay. From the 20th to the 23d, Anchorage was at Okinawa to disembark Marines and to unload their equipment. During this time, PhibRon 5 was relieved of duties as ARG Alfa. The ship then paid a short visit to Yokosuka, Japan, for liberty and the loading of equipment for transportation to the United States. Sailing from Japan on 30 November, the vessel arrived in San Diego on 10 December. ====1971==== Anchorage remained in availability until 20 February 1971, when she got underway for Port Hueneme, California. There, she loaded construction materials for a communications center on the island in the Indian Ocean, Diego Garcia, to be built as a part of Operation Reindeer Station. She left the California coast on 22 February bound for Australia. The vessel made port calls at Sydney and Perth, Australia, late in March and then pushed on into the Indian Ocean. Upon arriving at Diego Garcia on 4 April, she unloaded the construction materials and sailed the next day for Subic Bay to obtain minor repairs and replenishment. Following a visit to Hong Kong from 17 to 22 April, the ship sailed to Danang where she embarked Marine Corps personnel and equipment for return to the United States as part of Operation Keystone Robin. On 23 April, she shaped a course for San Diego. Anchorage arrived in her home port on 11 May and, on 28 June, resumed operations as a training ship for landing exercises off Seal Beach, California. This study was followed by refresher training and a period inport at San Diego. From 2 to 6 August, the vessel was again involved in exercises off Seal Beach. She left San Diego on 16 August to sail to her namesake city, Anchorage, Alaska, where she remained from 22 to 26 August. After pausing at Alameda, California, to unload aircraft, she arrived back at San Diego on 1 September and entered upkeep. The ship sailed for Hawaii on 1 October and, en route, participated in Convoy Exercise 3-71. She spent two days at Pearl Harbor before continuing on to Buckner Bay, Okinawa. There, she rejoined ARG Alfa and embarked Marines for transportation to Subic Bay. Early in November, the ship visited Kaohsiung, Taiwan. From 13 to 20 November, she shuttled landing craft between Vung Tau and Subic Bay. During the last few weeks of 1971, the ship visited Sasebo, Japan, and Hong Kong for liberty calls and also carried Marines and equipment from Okinawa to Subic Bay. ====1972==== After a period of repair work, Anchorage sailed for Buckner Bay on 17 January 1972 to embark Marines for transportation back to Subic Bay. Late in January, she carried out wet-well operations at Danang, Qui Nhon, and Vung Tau and, in mid-February, traveled to Singapore for a visit before returning to Subic Bay. After a brief trip to Kure, Japan, in early March, the ship was involved in amphibious exercises. On 31 March, she got underway to rendezvous with Task Group 76.5 which she met on 2 April for operations off the coast of Vietnam through 6 May. The ship was at Subic Bay from 9 to 18 May and then sailed back to Vietnamese waters for wet- well lifts to Vung Tau, Hoi An, and Danang. On 24 May, she took part in Exercise \\"Song Thanh 6-72\\". She reached Okinawa on 14 June to embark troops bound for the Philippines and arrived at Subic Bay on the 20th. After a series of amphibious landing exercises, Anchorage resumed wet-well operations between Vung Tau and Subic Bay. The vessel visited Kaohsiung in early July, then arrived back at Subic Bay on the 8th. She left the Philippines, bound for home, on 9 July and made San Diego on 24 July. She remained in port through 4 December, when the vessel got underway for independent type exercises off the southern California coast. She returned to San Diego on the 7th and entered a holiday leave and upkeep status. ====1973==== After local operations, Anchorage traveled to Seal Beach late in January 1973 to unload her ammunition. She returned to San Diego on 1 February and began overhaul there on the 19th. During this yard work, a fire broke out in a maintenance shop and prolonged her stay in overhaul. The ship finally got underway on 23 September for sea trials and started refresher amphibious training late in October. On 8 December, the vessel commenced another WestPac deployment. ====1974==== During the cruise, the ship visited Subic Bay; Buckner Bay; Sasebo and Iwakuni, Japan; Diego Garcia; and Singapore. While off Korea, Anchorage joined ARG Bravo for Operation Fly Away. Leaving Subic Bay on 28 March 1974, she made stops at Guam and Pearl Harbor before arriving back in San Diego on 18 April and entering a standdown period which lasted through 29 July. On that day, the ship sailed northward to carry out a survey mission of potential amphibious training areas in Alaska. During her cruise, embarked scientists surveyed 10 possible landing sites and the vessel visited in Seattle, Washington; Nanaimo, British Columbia; and Sitka and Anchorage, Alaska, before reaching San Diego again on 5 September. Anchorage began a restricted availability at Long Beach, California, on 17 October and, after the work was completed on 16 December, she returned to home port for the holidays. ====1975==== On 6 January 1975, the ship began two weeks of amphibious refresher training off the southern California coast. She then participated in Operation Bedstream with other ships of PhibRon 5. After a period of upkeep in San Diego, Anchorage again sailed for the Orient on 28 March. In April 1975, Anchorage participated in Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon, Vietnam.By Sea, Air and Land: An Illustrated History of the U.S. Navy and the war in Southeast Asia Chapter 5: The Final Curtain, 1973-1975 The ship reached Vietnamese waters on 30 April and provided material support to ships evacuating Vietnamese refugees. On 2 May, she left the Vung Tau holding area with the other ships involved in Operation Frequent Wind. On 13 May, her scheduled operations were interrupted by the Mayaguez incident. Anchorage was ordered to proceed south to provide support as needed for the rescue of . Following the ship's rescue, Anchorage resumed her original schedule which included upkeep in Sasebo, Japan; a visit to Keelung, Taiwan; and a port call to Inchon, Republic of Korea. Early September brought her a liberty call at Hong Kong. She then proceeded to Yokosuka for upkeep. Following stops at Keelung and Buckner Bay, Anchorage sailed from Okinawa on 28 October to return to her home port. En route, she participated in Operation Polymode before arriving at San Diego on 16 November for upkeep and local operations through the end of the year. ====1976==== During the first three and one-half months of 1976 Anchorage continued local operations off the southern California coast. From 26 April through 17 June, she was in restricted availability in preparation for a visit to Alaska. However, that trip was cancelled, and the ship prepared to deploy for the rest of the year. ====1976==== Tests and inspections occupied Anchorage during the first two and one-half months of 1976 before another WestPac deployment began on 28 March. She stopped briefly at Pearl Harbor, then pushed on to Eniwetok to unload cargo and vehicles. During her cruise, the ship served as a member of ARG Alfa. She also visited Guam; Subic Bay and Iloilo, Philippines; Singapore; Hong Kong for the Bicentennial; Keelung; and Yokosuka. Among the amphibious exercises in which she participated was Operation Fortress Lightning, held in the Philippines, in waters near Santa Cruz, Mindanao Island, from 10 to 23 October. Upon the conclusion of this exercise, the vessel made her way back to the west coast of the United States via Okinawa, Guam, and Hawaii. On 17 November, she pulled into San Diego and spent the rest of the year in upkeep. ====1978==== The ship was involved in training operations along the California coast in January 1978. On 20 February, she got underway for Bremerton, Washington, to carry Army troops to their home base. The ship arrived at San Diego on 3 March and began preparations for overhaul. She got underway, in tow of , for the Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 14 April, and commenced a regular overhaul there the next day. Upon completion of this work, the ship resumed operations on 13 December when she began sea trials. ====1979==== Anchorage returned to San Diego on 15 January 1979. During the next eight months, she was involved in post-overhaul maintenance and training. She operated along the southern California coast and held refresher training and amphibious refresher training. On 24 September, the ship got underway to take part in Exercise Kernal Potlatch II, a joint American-Canadian fleet exercise. Having concluded a successful amphibious landing on the northern coast of Vancouver Island, she made a port call at Esquimalt, British Columbia. After debarking Marines at Camp Pendleton, Anchorage returned to San Diego on 13 October. She participated in local operations and training exercises through the end of the year in preparation for an upcoming deployment in 1980. ====1980==== Four days into the new year, Anchorage slipped her moorings and left San Diego bound for the exotic Orient. Along the way, she visited Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands, and Guam in the Mariana Islands before arriving at Subic Bay in the Philippines on 6 February 1980. Upon arrival, she loaded a refurbished utility landing craft (LCU) for transportation to the Republic of Djibouti, former French Somaliland, located on the northeast coast of Africa near the Horn of Africa. The LCU-dubbed Le Bac de la Paix (tr. the boat of peace)-was a gift from the United States to Djibouti to enhance the country's inadequate commercial transportation system. Anchorage stood out of Subic Bay on 15 February to begin her goodwill mission. Steaming by way of Singapore, she crossed the Indian Ocean and arrived in Djibouti on 3 March. The Anchorage spent two days in Djibouti, delivering America's gift and helping to cement relations between the two governments and peoples. From Djibouti, she headed for Diego Garcia Island to deliver barges to that isolated American outpost in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The ship stopped at Diego Garcia from 12 to 15 March and then resumed her voyage back to the Philippines. She made a stop at Penang, Malaysia, along the way and reentered Subic Bay on 24 March. During the three months that remained of her 1980 deployment, Anchorage carried out operations in surroundings more familiar to 7th Fleet ships than the Horn of Africa and the Indian Ocean. Early in April, she visited Hong Kong before voyaging to Okinawa to embark Marine Corps units on the 17th and 18th. From Okinawa, the dock landing ship sailed via Subic Bay and Singapore to Thailand where she joined elements of the Royal Thai Navy and the Royal Thai Marine Corps in amphibious training exercises. She concluded the interlude in Thai waters with a visit to Pattaya between 5 and 10 May. Anchorage returned to Subic Bay on 19 May and remained in port until near the end of the first week in June. On 6 June, she got underway to return the embarked Marines to their base on Okinawa. She stopped at Naha, Okinawa, from 10 to 12 June and then returned to sea for the voyage back to the United States. The trip home included a two-day stop at Pearl Harbor and ended back at San Diego on 3 July. After the usual month of relative inactivity following an overseas deployment, Anchorage began west coast operations early in August with a courtesy visit to Seattle, Washington, for the city's annual sea fair. Normal duties continued until late September when she returned to San Diego for a two-month availability. Anchorage completed repairs on 20 November and resumed operations out of her home port. ====1981==== Various training evolutions occupied her time through May and into June 1981. On 23 June, Anchorage stood out of San Diego on her way to duty with the 7th Fleet in the Far East. She stopped at Pearl Harbor at the beginning of July and remained in the Hawaiian Islands for the first three weeks of the month completing an oft-delayed propulsion plant certification. On the 22d, she resumed her voyage west. Anchorage entered her first western Pacific port at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 3 August and embarked Marine Corps units for transportation to Yokosuka, Japan. Throughout, her assignment with the 7th Fleet, Anchorage spent much of her time carrying Marines between their bases and training exercises. In some cases, Anchorage herself participated in the exercises; in others, she simply provided transportation to the location of the exercise. Consequently, she called at a number of ports in the Orient-most frequently at ports in Okinawa, Japan, and Korea but also at Thai ports occasionally. Anchorage completed her last 7th Fleet mission at Naha, Okinawa, late in November and, on the 21st got underway for the voyage back to California. En route, she made an 11-day visit to Guam and a brief, one-day pause at Pearl Harbor. She pulled into San Diego two days before Christmas. ====1982==== Post-deployment leave and upkeep carried her well into January 1982. After a brief period underway in the southern California operating area Anchorage began preparations at the end of January for regular overhaul at San Diego. The actual repair and modification work began on 1 March. Over the ensuing seven months, the ship received general repairs and upgrading throughout as well as work on her propulsion plant, modernization of her communications spaces, and an enhancement of her defense capability against antiship missiles. Anchorage conducted sea trials in the local operating area during the first half of November and then spent the remainder of the year in port. ====1983==== Anchorage resumed operations out of San Diego early in 1983. In May, she paid a courtesy visit to her namesake city, Anchorage, Alaska. Upon her return to San Diego in the middle of June, Anchorage began a three-month availability in preparation for a deployment to the western Pacific scheduled to start in the middle of September. Except for a period underway between 22 and 31 August, Anchorage was in San Diego continuously from 11 June to 12 September. On the latter day, she slipped her moorings and stood out to sea on her way back to the Far East. The usual stop at Pearl Harbor lasted from 20 September to 2 October, and then Anchorage resumed the voyage west. The dock landing ship arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 14 October. She spent the rest of October at Yokosuka, then got underway for Okinawa on 1 November to begin conveying Marine Corps units between their bases and the sites of training exercises. As in the past, the dock landing ship participated in some, but not all, of the exercises to which she provided transportation for the Marines. ====1984==== The deployment lasted through the end of 1983 and into the early months of 1984. She disembarked her last Marine Corps passengers at Yokosuka at the end of January 1984 and remained there until the beginning of the second week in February. On the 8th, Anchorage set out upon the first leg of the voyage back to the United States. On her way, she made stops at Guam and at Pearl Harbor before ending the deployment at San Diego on 6 March 1984. Except for a brief period underway inside the port on 17 April, Anchorage remained moored at San Diego for almost five months performing repairs and modifications. Near the end of July, she began sea trials out of San Diego that lasted into the fourth week in August. On 23 August the dock landing ship made the brief passage from San Diego to her new home port, Long Beach. Anchorage took about two weeks to get settled into her new base of operations and then embarked upon a series of training evolutions in the local operating area. ====1985‚Äì1986==== Those drills and exercises - punctuated by periods in port for upkeep and repairs - occupied her time during the remaining months of 1984 and for most of the first quarter of 1985. On 27 March 1985, she left Long Beach bound for the Orient. The dock landing ship interrupted her long voyage briefly at Sasebo, Japan, on 16 April to pick up mail and then arrived at Pohang, Korea, on the 17th. At Pohang, Anchorage embarked a Marine Corps contingent and set sail for Okinawa on 18 April. For the next four months, she criss-crossed the distant reaches of the Pacific delivering Marines to various points for combat training and returning them to their bases. On occasion, she joined in the exercises herself to practice her role as an amphibious warship. Her final group of passengers came on board at Yokohama, Japan, between 9 and 11 August and disembarked at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on the 14th. On the 15th Anchorage began the passage home. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from the 26th to the 28th and arrived in Del Mar, Calif., on 3 September 1985. The following day, Anchorage moved to Long Beach where she began a five-week post-deployment stand-down. With her return to active operations on 10 October, Anchorage embarked upon an extended period of local operations that occupied her not only during the remainder of 1985 but for the whole of 1986 as well. ====1987==== As of the beginning of 1987, Anchorage was moored at Long Beach. In January 1987, Anchorage got underway for her Westpac deployment. Whilst in the Bering Sea, the ship and crew battled 90-foot (27 m) seas sailing through an area where two cyclones had merged. Unfortunately, the USS Belleau Wood (LHA 3) received extensive damage from the storm which led to an extended stay in the naval shipyards at Subic Bay. Other ports of call during the deployment included Okinawa, Japan; Pohang and Pusan, Korea; Pattaya Beach, Thailand; Hobart, Tasmania and Pearl Harbor, HI. Anchorage had the privilege to turn sailors and Marines into Golden Shellbacks on 4 March 1987 when she crossed the Equator and the International Dateline simultaneously. During the 1987 crossing, Anchorage was hosting Golf Battery 3/12. After the Crossing the Line Ceremony at the Equator, Belleau Wood lost power as both engines and one of two generators stopped, causing her to drift for 5 days at sea and have to be towed by the Anchorage. Destined for Tasmania, the Belleau Wood limped into Sydney Harbor for repairs to the boilers while the Anchorage replaced her in Tasmania. This left the Belleau Wood with the unfortunate nickname 'The USS Driftwood'. ===Operation Desert Storm=== ====1991==== In 1991, she served in Operation Desert Storm. ====1994==== In 1994, she served in Operation Continue Hope in Mogadishu, Somalia. Also while there assisted in Operation Quick Draw and Operation Distant Runner with the Hotel Rwanda incident and Burundi. ====1996==== In 1996, following completion of a deployment during which she supported Operation Southern Watch in the Persian Gulf, Anchorage entered dry dock for her final dry dock planned maintenance availability during which she received numerous systems upgrades and modifications. ===USS Cole bombing=== ====2000==== Later in 2000 she was used to assist following her bombing in Yemen. ===Middle East operations ‚Äì decommissioning=== ====2003==== In July 2003, Anchorage returned to her home port of San Diego, California after supporting Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. She was decommissioned on 1 October 2003. Anchorage was approved for transfer to Taiwan by the United States Senate in November 2003. She was scheduled to replace the former , now Chung Cheng, however the transfer never took place and Anchorage remained at the Inactive Ships Maintenance Facility at Pearl Harbor. ====2010==== On 17 July 2010, Anchorage was used as a target during RIMPAC for Maverick and Harpoon missiles fired from US Patrol Squadrons VP-5 and VP-40. After nearly 6 hours of being pounded by anti-ship cruise missiles and air dropped bombs, Anchorage would not sink and the , was called in to finish the job. One well-placed torpedo lifted the ship out of the water and broke her keel. Nearly 22 minutes later, Anchorage slipped beneath the waves completing the final stage of the RIMPAC 2010 SINKEX.http://www.hullnumber.com/LSD-36 ==Notes== ;Citations ==Bibliography== ;Online sources * ==External links== * DANFS * Category:Anchorage-class dock landing ships Category:Ships built in Pascagoula, Mississippi Category:1968 ships Category:Cold War amphibious warfare vessels of the United States Category:Vietnam War amphibious warfare vessels of the United States Category:United States Navy Alaska-related ships ","title":"USS Anchorage (LSD-36)"},{"id":"845410","text":"\\"Excellence in Broadcasting\\" is the second episode of the ninth season of the animated comedy series Family Guy.

As well as Limbaugh, the episode featured guest performances by Gary Cole, Christine Lakin, Phil LaMarr, Shelley Long, Nana Visitor and Rainn Wilson, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \\"Excellence in Broadcasting\\" was released on DVD along with three other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011. ==Plot== In light of \\"And Then There Were Fewer\\", the Griffins are watching the news ‚Äî where Tom Tucker reveals that Diane Simmons committed the murders at James Woods' mansion and is now dead. He then introduces Diane's successor, Joyce Kinney. As Lois reads the newspaper, she discovers that conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh is holding a book signing in Quahog. This enrages Brian, who despises Limbaugh over his political beliefs and decides to confront him at the signing. There, Limbaugh is criticized by Brian, but he counters by asking him whether he has read any of his books, leaving Brian dumbfounded and angry. As he curses Limbaugh to himself on his way home, Brian is mugged by a gang; Limbaugh abruptly shows up and beats them all to rescue Brian. Thankful, Brian agrees to read four pages of Limbaugh's book. This he does, but Brian grows interested enough to continue reading the book overnight. By then, he becomes a conservative Republican. Lois questions Brian's conviction, citing his past liberalism, while Brian defends his ability to change his mind based on new information. Lois also mentions that Brian goes out of his way to not agree with the general consensus on many things (for example, he hated Slumdog Millionaire and Titanic but defends the movie Cocktail), and accuses him of being a \\"contrarian\\" rather than a genuine believer. Brian meets with Limbaugh to thank him for helping his political conversion, and the two travel to the Republican National Headquarters, where they are greeted by former President of the United States George W. Bush and United States Senator John McCain. Returning home, Lois is unimpressed when Brian tells her that Limbaugh will be coming over for dinner. That night, Lois begins arguing and challenging Limbaugh politically ‚Äî with Peter joining in as well. She then accuses Limbaugh of brainwashing Brian, and demands for their dog to go back to the way he used to be. Limbaugh insists Brian became a conservative on his own terms, and the two sing a number based on \\"The Company Way\\", \\"Republican Town\\". Brian, outraged by Lois' unsupportive behaviour, decides to move out and become roommates with Limbaugh ‚Äî who reluctantly allows him to move into his house. Brian soon begins to irritate Limbaugh with his blind devotion. He replaces lots of Limbaugh's possessions with American-Made versions, which all go wrong. Brian then proceeds to follow Limbaugh to his radio show, where he attempts to voice his own political opinions on the air about Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. This frustrates Limbaugh, who ends up having Brian thrown out. Despite this, Brian continues to try and prove his devotion to the conservative cause by waterboarding Pelosi ‚Äî only to end up getting apprehended and sent to jail. Later on, Limbaugh bails out Brian, but he grows annoyed when Brian again tries to assert his conservatism. This prompts Limbaugh to tell Brian he is only fighting against the Establishment due to his desire of being the underdog. He proves his point by telling Brian that a child was executed in Texas, causing Brian to be visibly horrified; Limbaugh then says that he made up the story, but Brian's honest reaction to it shows he is a liberal at heart. Reassuring Brian of his liberal convictions, Limbaugh leaves the jail, making a Grapes of Wrath-like pledge to \\"be around\\" wherever conservative causes need help. Outside, they heckle each other with reassurance before waving goodbye to the other. The episode ends with Brian watching Limbaugh transform into a bald eagle and subsequently flying away into the skyline. ==Production and development== Limbaugh guest starred as himself in \\"Excellence in Broadcasting\\". First announced by series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane in an interview on August 13, 2009, the episode was written by series regular Patrick Meighan, and directed by series regular John Holmquist shortly after the conclusion of the production of the eighth season. In the interview, with The Hollywood Reporter, MacFarlane conceded that Family Guy tends to be very liberal because \\"it's written by liberals\\". In choosing the conservatives who would be featured in the episode, MacFarlane stated, \\"we put it out there to a lot of Republicans ‚Äî 'we're doing this show, who wants in?' ‚Äî and we got some bites.\\" Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising director, with Andrew Goldberg, Alex Carter, Elaine Ko and Spencer Porter serving as staff writers for the episode. Composer Walter Murphy, who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for \\"Excellence in Broadcasting\\". It is the first episode to feature a high-definition opening credit sequence. On The Rush Limbaugh Show on September 27, 2010, Limbaugh explained that he agreed to do the episode based on his continuing friendly relationship with Family Guy creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, commenting, \\"Seth appreciates and has a great affection for professionals, and we're all professionals here.\\" Limbaugh went on to reveal that he was in the studio's sound booth for \\"three or four days at four hours at a time,\\" while recording his lines for the episode, as well as for the accompanying musical number, which Limbaugh admitted to being something of a challenge. Later on his radio show, Limbaugh went on to criticize 20th Century Fox's public relations department, following a comment by author and commentator Andrew Breitbart, accusing the Fox Broadcasting Company of \\"burying\\" the episode. Limbaugh also admitted, however, that \\"there was nothing in the script that would want them to edit out.\\" \\"Excellence in Broadcasting\\", along with the two other episodes from Family Guys ninth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on December 13, 2011. The sets include brief audio commentaries by various crew and cast members for several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes and animatics, a special mini-feature which discussed the process behind animating \\"And Then There Were Fewer\\", a mini-feature entitled \\"The Comical Adventures of Family Guy ‚Äì Brian & Stewie: The Lost Phone Call\\", and footage of the Family Guy panel at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. In addition to the regular cast and Limbaugh, actor Gary Cole, actress Christine Lakin, voice actor Phil LaMarr, actress Shelley Long, actress Nana Visitor and actor Rainn Wilson guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Chris Cox, actor Ralph Garman, and writers Danny Smith, Alec Sulkin, John Viener and Wellesley Wild also made minor appearances. ==Cultural references== Senator John McCain was parodied in the episode. In the opening scene of the episode, the Griffin family are shown watching the syndicated television show The Brady Bunch, with Mike and Carol Brady then appearing in bed with one another. After Lois discovers that Limbaugh will be appearing at a book signing in Quahog, Chris references a previous episode, \\"FOX-y Lady\\", in which Limbaugh appeared as a character created by actor Fred Savage, which was subsequently reported on by Lois for Fox News. The episode featured a brief cameo appearance of conservative character Stan Smith from Seth MacFarlane's second show, American Dad!. The scene of Limbaugh rescuing Brian is an almost shot-for-shot homage to the scene of Mr. Miyagi rescuing Daniel in The Karate Kid. Returning home after being saved by Limbaugh, Brian begins watching the NBC comedy series The Office, featuring actor and comedian Rainn Wilson. Deciding to thank Limbaugh for his newfound conservatism, Brian is taken by Limbaugh to the National Republican Party headquarters in Washington, D.C., in order to meet former President of the United States George W. Bush and United States Senator John McCain from Arizona. McCain then recalls when he and Limbaugh solved mysteries together. A parody of the animated television series Scooby-Doo is then shown, including McCain and Limbaugh capturing United States Congressman Barney Frank from Massachusetts, disguised as a mummy. After deciding to sing a song entitled \\"Republicantown,\\" several political figures are shown and parodied, including former Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney and former Presidents of the United States Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Actors Mickey Rourke, Chuck Norris and Jon Voight also appear, while Voight's \\"pretty hot at one time\\" daughter is Angelina Jolie. The song \\"Republicantown\\" is a parody of the song \\"The Company Way\\" from the musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. ==Reception== \\"Excellence in Broadcasting\\" was broadcast on October 3, 2010, as a part of an animated television night on Fox, and was preceded by The Simpsons, and Family Guy creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane's spin-off, The Cleveland Show, and followed by the 100th episode of American Dad!. It was watched by 7.94 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, despite airing simultaneously with Desperate Housewives on ABC, the season premiere of Undercover Boss on CBS and Sunday Night Football on NBC. The episode also acquired a 3.9 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, beating American Dad! and The Cleveland Show in addition to significantly edging out both shows in total viewership. The episode's ratings decreased significantly from the show's season premiere. Television critics reacted mostly mixed to \\"Excellence in Broadcasting\\", calling the storyline \\"funny,\\" but \\"toothless.\\" In a simultaneous review of the episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded the show, and the broadcast of American Dad! that followed it, The A.V. Club reviewer Rowan Kaiser noted, \\"most of the episode was spent justifying its existence as a Rush Limbaugh episode of Family Guy,\\" and that the episode \\"failed to do that.\\" In the conclusion of his review Kaiser praised Family Guy for its past political humor, but ultimately rated it as a D, the second worst rating, behind The Simpsons episode \\"Loan-a Lisa\\" and the American Dad! episode \\"100 A.D.\\", beating only The Cleveland Show's F-grade episode \\"Cleveland Live!\\". In a slightly more positive review, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised Limbaugh's appearance in the episode, commenting Limbaugh \\"certainly deserves credit for his willingness to participate and lend his own voice.\\" Hughes went on to comment positively on the episode's debut of the high-definition opening sequence, and its introduction of Joyce Kinney as a replacement for news anchor Diane Simmons, who was killed off in \\"And Then There Were Fewer.\\" Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \\"The show definitely skewered Brian‚Äôs hardcore conservative conversion, but overall it seemed like a pretty fair fight.\\" Limbaugh's appearance in the episode has drawn both praise and criticism from news outlets, including Daniel Foster of National Review who commented, \\"It is to Mr. Limbaugh's credit that he can make fun of himself. But Seth MacFarlane, the whiskey-soaked Dada creator of Family Guy, is responsible for more sophomoric cartooning than the combined patrons of America‚Äôs truck stop and dive bar bathrooms.\\" Foster went on to add, \\"I can only look at the Limbaugh-MacFarlane mash-up with a wary eye.\\" Columnist Matt Lewis of Politics Daily also questioned Limbaugh's appearance on Family Guy, citing his support for former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin, whose daughter, Bristol Palin, has openly criticized MacFarlane and called the show's writers \\"heartless jerks.\\" In contrast, John Nolte of Andrew Breitbart's Big Hollywood wrote, \\"What MacFarlane‚Äôs doing fits exactly into our template. He‚Äôs entitled to his opinion, worked very hard to reach the top of the most difficult business there is to succeed in, and in turn uses that forum to further his own agenda ‚Äî that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to work. But at the same time he doesn‚Äôt completely shut us out.\\" Prior to the episode's official broadcast on television in the United States, Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post called Limbaugh's guest appearance in the episode \\"genuinely funny,\\" and David Weigel of Slate commented, \\"I'm not at all surprised that Limbaugh would embrace the show and answer its mockery of conservatives; the plotline is a perfect conservative narrative.\\" ==References* * Category:2010 American television episodes Category:Family Guy (season 9) episodes ","title":"Excellence in Broadcasting"},{"id":"845411","text":"Shank may refer to: == Objects == * Shank (footwear), part of a shoe or boot * Shank (sewing), a spacing device * Shank (weapon), a makeshift knife or stabbing weapon * Lead shank, a type of lead used for horses * Tang (tools), the back portion of the blade component of a tool * Drill bit shank, the end of a drill bit * Sheepshank, a knot used to shorten a rope == Art and entertainment == * Shank (video game), an action game * Shank (2009 film), a British drama * Shank (2010 film), a thriller set in futuristic London * Shank, a play by Richard Vincent * Warlord Shank, a villain in the TV series Space Cases ==Places== * Mount Schank, a dormant volcano in Australia * Shankh Monastery, a monastery in Mongolia * Shanksville, Pennsylvania == Other uses == * Tibia, part of the leg * Shank (meat), a cut of meat (e.g., beef shank) * Shank, a poor golf stroke * Shanks, wading birds in the genus Tringa * Sheepshank, a knot used to shorten a rope * Shankh, a quantity in the Indian numbering system * SHANK1, SHANK2, and SHANK3, types of protein ==People with the name== * Bud Shank, an American saxophonist * Christopher B.

Mustard was intended to operate as a multistage rocket, the individual stages comprising near- identical spaceplane modules. These planes, or stages, were hypersonic vehicles, capable of flying at speeds in excess of five times the speed of sound. Following a vertically-standing launch, each stage was to progressively separate during the ascent, after which they would individually fly back towards a suitable landing strip. The final spaceplane was to be capable of attaining such an altitude that it would be able to achieve a sub-orbital trajectory before also performing a controlled return. Following a conventional landing, all of the stages were intended to be reused multiple times. It was projected that Mustard was suitable for launching payloads weighing as much as into orbit. The concept originated from studies performed by British manufacturing conglomerate English Electric, who had drawn inspiration from an American proposal, the Douglas Astro. Throughout the 1960s, the Mustard project was refined and prepared for programme launch. However, financing for the initiative was not forthcoming from the British government and the concept ultimately languished following the completion of the last major design study in early 1967. According to BAC's successor company BAE Systems, the projected cost of completing Mustard's development had been estimated as being between 20 and 30 times cheaper than the conventional expendable launch system used for the American Apollo program.\\"1960's 'Thunderbirds' projects brought to life.\\" BAE Systems, Retrieved: 2 January 2019. The knowledge and expertise from Mustard was applied in various other avenues, the most prominent being the HOTOL spaceplane programme during the 1980s. ==History== ===Origins=== During the 1940s and 1950s, the United Kingdom had undertaken numerous independent space- related ventures, such as the Black Knight ballistic missile programme and the abortive Black Arrow satellite launcher.Hill 2001, p. 188. While the ambitions of these programmes had been tempered both by cost and a political desire to collaborate with other Commonwealth and Western nations, such as the Europa launcher, Britain retained a considerable interest in the pursuit of various space-related technologies.Hill 2001, p. 13. The field of re-usable space vehicles was no exception to this interest, British manufacturing conglomerate English Electric had undertaken preliminary work on the topic at their facility in Warton, Lancashire, as part of a government-sponsored series of wider studies into high-speed vehicles and sub-orbital spaceplanes. During 1960, the aerospace activities of English Electric were merged with those of multiple other firms in the formation of the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC). The new entity continued its sponsored research into these concepts. According to author Nigel Henbest, one of BAC's research teams, headed by engineer Tom Smith, Chief of the Aerospace Department at BAC,\\"Economical Space Transport.\\" Flight International, 24 March 1966, p. 473. that was initially investigating supersonic and hypersonic flight problems, became interested in the application of such a vehicle for space-related activities. The team compared their performance estimates of a winged reusable launch vehicle against conventional multistage rockets, determining that the approach was not cost-effective, largely due to it requiring different rockets to power each stage. Instead, by simplifying the launcher to use near-identical winged vehicles, considerable cost savings would then be achievable both in terms of its development and manufacture. Associated costs would have been further reduced by all of the elements being reusable and without any need for post- mission refurbishment, only requiring refuelling. Furthermore, the scale of the vehicles could be increased or decreased to produce launch vehicles to suit virtually any weight and thrust requirements. It has been claimed that from an early stage, BAC's space-related research was being influenced by foreign space programmes, most significant of these being the United States; reportedly, the company engaged in detailed studies of various transatlantic projects and proposals. One particular proposed vehicle, the Douglas Astro, is said to have impressed British researchers; around the beginning of 1964, the Astro was adopted as a conceptual starting point for BAC's own clustered design, which the company came to refer to as the Multi-Unit Space Transport And Recovery Device or MUSTARD; however, in common parlance, this moniker was usually written simply as Mustard. In the most intensely-studied design, Mustard was to have weighed roughly 420 tonnes prior to launch, and be capable of delivering a payload of three tonnes into a geostationary earth orbit (GEO). ===Stall and termination=== During 1964, the design of Mustard had reached the point where it was effectively complete. However, Smith acknowledges that in order to have continued the project through to the manufacturing stage, several billion pounds of investment would have been required, the financing of which was neither budgeted or planned for by any entity. Writing for the scientific periodical New Scientist, author Nigel Henbest commented that it was unlikely that Britain could pursue development of Mustard alone, but also suggested that there was potential value for the platform if organised as a multinational European venture, similar to the conventional Europa and Ariane launchers. During early 1967, the last major design study on the topic was drawn up, after which the project was continued at a lower level until work on Mustard was finally terminated in 1970 by the British government, who had decided to participate in the new American post- Apollo project instead. Accordingly, a number of key Mustard project staff had spent the first two years of the 1970s overseas at North American Rockwell, where they contributed to the initial study which would eventually lead to the US Space Shuttle. Around this time, the prospect of collaboration is said to have faded and, in the absence of meaningful interest from the British government, the Mustard project was effectively terminated. During early 1977, BAC was itself later merged with rival Hawker Siddeley to form British Aerospace (B.Ae) and when the re-useable HOTOL spaceplane project arose in 1984, the project team was relocated to Warton, where they took advantage of the expertise that had been accumulated during the earlier Mustard project.Sharp 2016, . Writing of Mustard's cancellation, Henbest wrote that the absence of \\"political courage\\" had been largely responsible for the failure of the venture to become reality; furthermore, if further research had been financed by the Ministry of Aviation, then Britain may have been able to play a larger role in other space programmes, such as the American Space Shuttle.Henbest, Nigel. \\"How Britain missed out on MUSTARD.\\" New Scientist, Vol. 110, No. 1509. ISSN 0262-4079. 22 May 1986, p. 60. ==Design== ===Modules=== Mustard was a modular re-usable space launch system, comprising multiple copies of a single vehicle design, each of which was configured for a different role as a booster stage or an orbital spaceplane. The core vehicle design resembled the basic layout of the Douglas Astro, both being delta- winged reusable vehicles, as would the later American Space Shuttle. Furthermore, all three functioned as vertically-launched rockets and used integral wings so that they could land horizontally, akin to an aeroplane.\\"BAC MUSTARD Project Artwork Archive\\", Britain in Space, \\"Space Transporters for Europe?\\" Flight International, 10 March 1966, p. 402. The design evolved through a total of fifteen proposed variants or schemes, each typically comprising a deep-keeled lifting-body airframe with delta wings in a smooth blended wing body layout, with twin tail fins rising from the wing tips and canted outwards. Some early variants featured a compound-delta wing, complete with inboard tail fins. Power was provided by an arrangement of between one and four rocket engines positioned upon the rear fuselage. Due to the relatively low re-entry speed anticipated, it was believed that complex heat- resistant tiling could be dispensed with in favour of simpler and cheaper nickel-alloy panelling across the vehicle's underside. Mustard was to be crewed by between three and six astronauts. Operationally, there were two primary vehicle configurations, the orbiter and booster stages, respectively. The orbiter vehicle, which carried the desired payload, featured ducting to receive fuel from the boosters, while the booster units incorporated systems for transferring fuel across to the orbiter vehicle or between one another. In this fashion, the orbiter could remain fully topped-up for its long orbital injection flight, while all the vehicles could still share a standardised fuel tank design. According to Smith, the orbiting vehicle would have been capable of performing between 30 and 50 launches before needing to be replaced, while the booster engines, which wouldn't have been subject to as much heat and stress, would have remained usable for up to 200 times. ===Clustering and stacking=== Various clustering and stacking arrangements were explored. Where the Astro would have launched as a two-stage step-rocket, for which the booster would have been much larger than the orbiter, Mustard comprised from three to five near-identically-sized modules. Early studies focused around a vehicle with a shallow 120¬∞ \\"vee\\" underside to both body and wings, so that three could be clustered in a triangle. Some included a fourth, orbital vehicle mounted on top of three boosters. The most efficient regime was to empty one booster at a time, keeping the others topped up for as long as possible, so that the first-stage booster could be dropped as soon as possible. The three boosters would be emptied in turn. But this led to an asymmetric mass loading which BAC believed to be a significant problem, so later designs used a sideways stacking system in which flatter modules were stacked more like sheets of paper. At , at around 30 nautical miles, the last of the booster units would separate; once clear, these unit would glide downwards and land upon a runway similar to conventional aircraft, allowing for their reuse. The spacecraft would place its payload into orbit at around 1,000 nautical miles, which would be achieved roughly 10 minutes after launch, and then return to Earth via a controlled gliding descent before conducting a landing in similar fashion to the booster units. Originally, it was envisioned that all three vehicles would be manned, however, when commenting during the mid-1980s, Smith observed that, due to technological advances, it would be possible for the booster units to be entirely automated using existing technology. ==See also== * List of space launch system designs *HOTOL *Space Shuttle ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * Hill, C.N. \\"A Vertical Empire: The History of the UK Rocket and Space Programme, 1950‚Äì1971.\\" World Scientific, 2001. . * Sharp, Dan.

Owen was the Vice-President of External, Legal and Community Relations for the University of British Columbia. Owen was the Member of Parliament for the electoral district of Vancouver Quadra, encompassing the western end of the City of Vancouver. He was a member of Prime Minister Paul Martin's Liberal government, serving in cabinet as Canada's tenth Minister of Western Economic Diversification and as Minister of State for Sport. ==Early career== Owen received LL.M. from University College London/University of London in 1974. He received MBA from the International Management Institute, University of Geneva in 1986, and J.D. from the University of British Columbia in 1972. During the 1980s, Owen worked for the government of British Columbia as a non-partisan official. He served as that province's ombudsman from 1986 to 1992, and as Commissioner for the ground-breaking Commission on Resources and Environment, which pioneered the province's multi-stakeholder land-use planning approach from 1992 to 1995. Subsequently Owen was the Deputy Attorney General for B.C. and, then, the David Lam Professor of Law & Public Policy, and Director, Institute for Dispute Resolution, University of Victoria (1997‚Äì2000) He is also the past commissioner and vice-president of the Law Commission of Canada. His cousin, Philip Owen, is a former mayor of Vancouver. ==Federal politics== Owen was first elected to the House of Commons in the 2000 federal election. He was appointed to Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien's cabinet on January 15, 2002, serving as Secretary of State for both Western Economic Diversification and Indian Affairs and Northern Development. On December 12, 2003, he was promoted by newly appointed Martin to Minister of Public Works and Government Services. In this capacity, he was a frequent target of opposition questions on the \\"sponsorship scandal\\". During his tenure, Owen was involved in the recovery of misappropriated public funds from Hewlett Packard; the company paid C$146 million to the government of Canada, and both parties agreed to jointly pursue companies who may also have been involved. Owen defeated former provincial cabinet minister Stephen Rogers in the federal election of 2004, winning by a much greater margin than most observers anticipated (he received 52.28% of the vote compared to Rogers' 26.24%.) He was named Minister of Western Economic Diversification and Minister of State for Sport on July 20, 2004. Under normal circumstances, this would have been considered a demotion, but the shuffle placed Owen in a powerful managerial position for preparation for the upcoming Olympic Games in British Columbia. During the federal election of 2006, held to elect the 39th Parliament, Owen again defeated Rogers and maintain his seat in Vancouver Quadra. Following the election, Owen was one of the early supporters of Michael Ignatieff for the Liberal Party Leadership, and is credited with moving other prominent British Columbians to support Ignatieff.

A helictite at Treak Cliff Cavern in Derbyshire A helictite is a speleothem (cave-formed mineral) found in a limestone cave that changes its axis from the vertical at one or more stages during its growth. Helictites have a curving or angular form that looks as if they were grown in zero gravity. They are most likely the result of capillary forces acting on tiny water droplets, a force often strong enough at this scale to defy gravity. Helictites are, perhaps, the most delicate of cave formations. They are usually made of needle-form calcite and aragonite. Helictite forms have been described in several types: ribbon helictites, saws, rods, butterflies, \\"hands\\", curly-fries, and \\"clumps of worms\\". They typically have radial symmetry. They can be easily crushed or broken by the slightest touch. Because of this, helictites are rarely seen within arm's reach in tourist caves. Timpanogos Cave National Monument in Utah has one of the largest collections of these formations in the world. Large numbers are also in the Jenolan Caves in Australia and in the Pozalagua Cave in Karrantza, Spain. A remarkable suite of helictites also occurs in Asperge Cave, France. == Formation == The growth of helictites is still quite enigmatic. To this day, there has been no satisfactory explanation for how they are formed. Currently, formation by capillary forces is the most likely theory, but another theory based on wind formation is also viable. === Capillary forces === The most likely theory explains helictites as a result of capillary forces. If the helictite has a very thin central tube where the water flows as it does in straws, capillary forces would be able to transport water against gravity. This theory was inspired by some hollow helictites. However, the majority of helictites are not hollow. Despite this, droplets can be drawn to the tips of existing structures and deposit their calcite load almost anywhere thereon. This can lead to the wandering and curling structures seen in many helictites. ===Wind=== Another theory names the wind in the cave as the main reason for the strange appearance. Drops hanging on a stalactite are blown to one side, so the dripstone grows in that direction. If the wind changes, the direction of growth changes too. However, this theory is very problematic, because wind directions change very often. The wind in caves depends on air pressure changes outside, which in turn depend on the weather. The wind direction changes as often as the weather conditions outside change. But the dripstones grow very slowly ‚Äì several centimeters in 100 years ‚Äì meaning that the wind direction would have to stay steady for long periods of time, changing for every fragment of a millimeter of growth. A second problem with this theory is that many caves with helictites have no natural entrance where wind could enter. ===Piezoelectric forces=== Another theory that has been proposed is that slowly changing geological pressure causing stresses on the crystals at the base alters the piezo electrostatic potential and causes particle deposition to be oriented in some relationship to the prevailing pressure orientation. ===Bacterial=== A recent theory, which is supported by observation, is that a prokaryotic bacterial film provides a nucleation site for mineralization process.Tisato, N. et al., ‚ÄúMicrobial mediation of complex subterranean mineral structures‚Äù, Sci. Rep. 5, 15525; doi: 10.1038/srep15525 (2015) ==Helictite growth== Helictites at Jenolan Caves in Australia. A helictite starts its growth as a tiny stalactite. The direction of the end of the straw may wander, twist like a corkscrew, or the main part may form normally while small helictites pop out of its side like rootlets or fishhooks. In some caves, helictites cluster together and form bushes as large as six feet tall. These bushes grow from the floor of the cave. When helictites are found on cave floors, they are referred to as heligmites, though there is debate as to whether this is a genuine subcategory. For an unknown reason, when the chemical composition of the water is slightly altered, the single crystal structure can change from a cylindrical shape to a conical one. In some of these cases, each crystal fits into the prior one like an inverted stack of ice cream cones.

The total distance traveled is 262 miles. Racers must take all equipment needed with them, receiving only medical supplies, food, water, and ice along the way. The primary requirement is a boat powered only by human muscle. The event was first held in 1963, and is run annually. The race begins on the second Saturday of June of each year, barring bad weather. In 1962 Frank Brown and Bill \\"Big Willie\\" George navigated from San Marcos to Corpus Christi without a motor. In 1963 they created the Texas Water Safari which would become an annual race. ==Course== The course includes natural rivers like the San Marcos, with rapids and dams. Most boats destroyed on the course are lost in the upper river. The San Marcos River converges with the Guadalupe River and becomes wider and slower. The main dangers in the middle river are sweepers, downed trees, logjams and dams. Near the end of the course there are lakes and swamps, and it ends with a crossing of the San Antonio Bay. Other challenges include alligators, sharks, water moccasin, fire ants, and mosquitos. There are 11 checkpoints including the finish line. Their locations are published and they are staffed with officials. Each checkpoint has a cutoff time the racers must meet or be disqualified. The final cutoff time at the finish is 100 hours. The team captain of each team must be present at the checkpoint to sign off the team's time as the team leaves. Checkpoints: *Staples Dam *Luling 90 *Palmetto State Park *Gonzales 183 *Hochheim *Cuero 766 (Cheapside) *Cuero 236 *Victoria City Park *Swinging Bridge (often referred to as Invista or Dupont) *Salt Water Barrier *Seadrift ==Records== Athletes compete in classes.

Wenige was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1874 and moved to London, Ontario, Canada as a stunt bicycle rider at the Western Fair in 1900. He liked the city and decided to stay, opening the Bicycle and Motor Sales Company. In 1915, a new shop was built, with Wenige insisting that it be completed in 30 days; he hired a brass band to motivate the workers. He claimed his shop \\"made walking expensive\\" and once bicycled from London to Halifax, Nova Scotia to promote his business. Wenige was a populist and was well loved by London's working class. He was elected alderman in 1921 and was elected to three consecutive terms as mayor from 1923 to 1925. In 1925, he attended the funeral of former mayor Sir Adam Beck, earning the scorn of London's upper class by wearing a business suit and a straw hat -- \\"the only hat I owned\\"‚Äîhe explained. Wenige was elected mayor again in 1928, 1934, 1935, 1947, 1948 and 1950 (at the time, London elected its mayors for one year only). In 1935, he ran as an independent candidate in the federal election but lost. He also campaigned for mayor, and lost on nine other occasions, including 1952, when he lost to Allan Rush, the former chief of police whom Wenige had fired during his term in 1950. Wenige died shortly afterwards.

In the original act of Parliament, the company was given jurisdiction over: :\\"all persons using to make Knives, Blades, Scissers, Sheeres, Sickles, Cutlery wares and all other wares and manufacture made or wrought of yron and steele, dwelling or inhabiting within the said Lordship and Liberty of Hallamshire, or within six miles compasse of the same\\".Sheffield Records Online Sheffield Master Cutlers and Apprentices The Cutlers' Hall in Sheffield City Centre This was expanded to include other trades by later acts, most notably steelmakers in 1860. In the same year the Company was given the right to veto any proposed name of a limited company anywhere in the United Kingdom which contains the word \\"Sheffield\\". It also supply marks to approved cutlers and promote Sheffield steelware. The company has been based at Cutlers' Hall (opposite the cathedral on Church Street) since 1638. The current hall is the third to have been built on the site. The second was built in 1725 and the third in 1832. It was extended in 1867 and 1888. It was listed a Grade II* listed building in 1973. It is used for formal functions and award ceremonies for local businesses. Members of the company are called freemen and currently number 447. The Master Cutler is elected each year from the freemen within the company. He or she also has 2 Wardens, 6 Searchers and 24 Assistants. The Company also employs a Clerk for administration and a Beadle to perform ceremonial duties. Since 1625, the Company has held an annual feast, inviting prominent people in order to showcase Sheffield's industry. The Master Cutler for 2011-12 was Pamela Liversidge, the first woman to hold this position.

They were one of the most successful bands in Bulgaria during the 1970s and 1980s and still have many fans. The band broke up once in 1990, reformed in 1997, and disbanded again in 2013. The group has been characterized as \\"Bulgaria's answer to The Beatles\\". ==History== The group was created in 1967 in Sofia by Kiril Marichkov, Petar Tsankov (both from Bandaratsite group), Petar Gyuzelev, and Veselin Kisyov (both from Slanchevi Bratya group). Their first performance was at a students party in VITIZ (The Bulgarian School for Performing Arts), and in 1967 they made their first records. At first Georgi Minchev took part in the group, too, and with him they made their first success: the song \\"Byala Tishina\\" (\\"–ë—è–ª–∞ —Ç–∏—à–∏–Ω–∞\\"; \\"White Silence\\") of the composer Boris Karadimchev, winning the national award of Zlatnia Orfei (\\"–ó–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–∏—è –û—Ä—Ñ–µ–π\\", the Golden Orpheus). In 1968, the group issued their first EP record containing the songs \\"Veselina\\" (\\"–í–µ—Å–µ–ª–∏–Ω–∞\\", lyrics: Radoy Ralin), Zvan (\\"–ó–≤—ä–Ω\\"; Ringing), Malkiat Svetal Prozorets (\\"–ú–∞–ª–∫–∏—è—Ç —Å–≤–µ—Ç—ä–ª –ø—Ä–æ–∑–æ—Ä–µ—Ü\\"; Little Bright Window) and Izprashtane (\\"–ò–∑–ø—Ä–∞—â–∞–Ω–µ\\", Dispatch). It was not before 1976 until they record their first homonymous LP with its hit single \\"Day Mi Malko Nejhnost\\" (\\"–î–∞–π –º–∏ –º–∞–ª–∫–æ –Ω–µ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç\\"; \\"Give Me A Little Tenderness\\"). Their second album Shturtzite '78 two years later introduced band's new keyboard playing and singing star Valdi Totev. His influence took away the band far from its early pop sound to a new prog rock territory. The first song on the LP \\"Nyakoi Ot Vas\\" (\\"–ù—è–∫–æ–∏ –æ—Ç –≤–∞—Å\\"; \\"Some Of You\\") is their first ever leading album song not to be sung by lead vocalist Marichkov, but by the new kid on the block, Totev. Despite his influence being more than obvious for the band's sound, Totev didn't write a single song for the album. In 1980, Shturcite issued XX vek (20th Century), featuring the hits \\"Dve sledi\\", the title track and \\"Svatben den\\". Two years later, the double LP Vkusut na vremeto (The Taste of Time) was issued, featuring many hits, such as the title track. The band spent the rest of the 1980s recording two new albums, Konnikut and Musketarski marsh, released in 1985 and 1987. They then played a national tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary throughout 1987. Tracks from the concerts were edited together into a triple album called 20 godini po-kusno, released in 1988. In 1990, the band released their final single, \\"Az sum prosto chovek\\", which became a popular anthem for Bulgarian democracy in the 1990s. They then broke up. Later that year, Balkanton released a compilation called The Crickets, which mainly consists of tracks from Musketarski marsh and also included a live version of the song \\"XX vek\\" (the recording is taken from 20 godini po-kusno). This was Shturcite's first official CD release and is one of only two issues of the 20 godini po-kusno songs on CD (the other being \\"Pesen za Shturcite\\" on 1968-1980). All the text on The Crickets is in English (except for the copyright warning on the CD, which is written in English, French, German and Bulgarian) and features liner notes by a woman called Claire Levi. It and a similar compilation by fellow Bulgarian rock band FSB are the first two rock releases on CD in the Balkanton catalogue. Six years later, the independent label GMP reissued most of their back catalogue (except for their two self- titled albums) on CD (albeit issuing a cut-down 13 track version of Vkusut na vremeto) and also released two 2-disc compilation albums by them, 1968-1980 and Best Ballads. A new song, \\"Kletva\\", was included on both compilations. The song is a re-recording of a track written for and previously featured in the film Vchera (1988) in 1987 and later appeared on the Kiril Marichkov solo album Zodia Shturec, from whose sessions the recording is taken. As well as \\"Kletva\\", the song \\"Za spomen ot Shturcite\\", recorded in 1983, was included. It is a medley of the following songs: *\\"Dve sledi\\" (Two Traces) *\\"Veselina\\" *\\"Zvun\\" (Ring) *\\"Pesen bez dumi\\" (A Song Without Words) *\\"Svatben den\\" (Wedding Day) *\\"Dai mi malko nezhnost\\" (Gimme a Little Tenderness) *\\"Zorata\\" (The Dawn) *\\"Star album\\" (Old Album) *\\"Pesen za Shturcite\\" (Song for Shturcite/Song for the Crickets) *\\"Vkusut na vremeto\\" (The Taste of Time) Another Shturcite medley was performed at the concerts that became 20 godini po-kusno in 1987, called \\"Kitka 'Shturcite'\\". In 1997, Shturcite reformed and played a national tour. 10 tracks from one of the concerts were released on the CD 30 godini Shturcite in 1998, alongside 6 new songs. The band released a 4-CD retrospective of their work, Antologia, in 2004. The release contained selected tracks from their discography and a few compilation and unreleased tracks. Their first 3 singles, \\"Zvun\\", \\"Pesen za Shturcite\\" and \\"Ti ne razbra\\", as well as Konnikut and Musketarski marsh, were included in full on the discs. A concert DVD was also issued two years later, recorded at the NDK on 15 November 2004, featuring guest appearances from Safo, D-2, Doni (from Doni i Momchil) and Ahat, who also did a cover of \\"Na praga\\". In 2007, Shturcite recorded new material, which was released as their 9th and final album Na praga na surceto in 2008. Na praga na surceto was their first release of all-new material since 1987's Musketarski marsh. The band still played concerts, but no new material was issued after Na praga na surceto. Marichkov had stated in interviews that guitarist Petar Gyuzelev's brain tumour was holding the band back. He had stated that if Gyuzelev dies, Shturcite would break up. In 2011, he had stated that Shturcite would hold a big concert with a symphony orchestra to end the band and celebrate 45 years of existence, plus record an acoustic CD containing their hits. Neither the concert or the album happened. Gyuzelev died on 25 April 2013, ending the band.http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=149862 Three months before his death, he issued Izpoved, his first and only solo album. In an interview with 24 chasa, he stated he had plans to release three more albums \\"before the end of the year\\".http://www.24chasa.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=1710880 With Gyuzelev's death, it is not known whether these albums will be released. Marichkov has since started a new band, Fondatsiata (The Foundation). On 3 June 2017, Shturcite reformed, with Marichkov's Fondatsiata bandmates Ivan Lechev (from FSB) and Slavcho Nikolov (from B.T.R.) replacing Gyuzelev on guitar, for a 50th anniversary concert at the Armeec Arena in Sofia. ==Members== * Kiril Marichkov - bass, vocals, keyboards (1967 - 1990, 1997 - 2013, 2017) * Petar \\"Petsi\\" Gyuzelev - guitars, vocals, (1967 - 1990, 1997 - 2013, d.2013) * Vladimir \\"Valdi\\" Totev - keyboards, guitars, harmonica, vocals (1976 - 1990, 1997 - 2013, 2017) * Georgi Markov - drums, percussion (1974 - 1990, 1997 - 2013, 2017) * Veselin Kisyov - guitar (1967 - 1969) * Petar Tsankov - drums (1967 - 1971) * Konstantin Atanasov (Kosyo Shturetsa) - guitar, vocals (1969 ‚Äì 1971, 1973 ‚Äì 1974, 1976) * Atanas Atanasov - drums (1973 ‚Äì 1974) * Borislav Panov - keyboards, vocals, violin (1974 ‚Äì 1976) * Ivan Lechev - guitar (2017, stand-in for Gyuzelev) * Slavcho Nikolov - guitar (2017, stand-in for Gyuzelev) ==Discography== === Albums === * Shturcite (1976) * Shturcite (1978) * 20-ti vek (1980) * Vkusat na vremeto (1982) * Konnikat (1985) * Musketarski marsh (1987) * 20 godini po-kasno (1988) * 30 godini Shturcite (1998) * Na praga na sartseto (2008) === Singles === All singles were officially self-titled except for \\"Puteshestvie sus sal\\" and \\"Az sum prosto chovek\\".

She also acted in plays, including Broadway. She was honored in 1969 at the Academy Awards as the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award recipient for her volunteer efforts and services to the troops. ==Early years== Raye's life as a singer and comedic performer began in very early childhood. She was born at St. James Hospital in Butte, Montana, as Margy Reed;Birth Certificate, ColonelMaggie.com; accessed September 16, 2014. despite her birth certificate showing Reed, some sources in the 1970s and 1980s gave her the surname O'Reed.New York, 19 January 1981, p. 108: 26 January 1981 p. 90. Her father, Peter F. Reed Jr., was an Irish immigrant; her mother, Maybelle Hazel (Hooper) Reed, was raised in Milwaukee and Montana. Her parents were performing in a local vaudeville theatre as Reed and Hooper when their daughter was born. Two days later, her mother was performing again. Martha first appeared in their act when she was three years old. She later performed with her brother Bud, and the children became so popular that their parents' act was renamed Margie and Bud. ==Career== In the early 1930s, Raye was a band vocalist with the Paul Ash and Boris Morros orchestras. She made her first film appearance in 1934 in a band short titled A Nite in the Nite Club. In 1936, she was signed for comic roles by Paramount Pictures, and made her first picture for Paramount. Her first feature film was Rhythm on the Range with crooner Bing Crosby. From 1936‚Äì39, she was a featured cast member in 39 episodes of Al Jolson's weekly CBS radio show, The Lifebuoy Program, also called Cafe Trocadero. In addition to comedy, Martha sang both solos and duets with Jolson. Over the next quarter century, she would appear with many of the leading comics of her day, including Joe E. Brown, Bob Hope, W.C. Fields, Abbott and Costello (in Keep 'Em Flying), Charlie Chaplin (in Monsieur Verdoux), and Jimmy Durante. She joined the USO in 1942, soon after the US entered World War II. She was known for the size of her mouth, which was large in proportion to her face, earning her the nickname The Big Mouth. She later referred to this in a series of television commercials for Polident denture cleaner in the 1980s: \\"So take it from The Big Mouth: new Polident Green gets tough stains clean!\\" Her large mouth would relegate her motion picture work to supporting comic parts, and was often made up so it appeared even larger. In the Disney cartoon Mother Goose Goes Hollywood, she is caricatured while dancing alongside Joe E. Brown, another actor known for a big mouth. In the Warner Bros. cartoon The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos (1937), she was caricatured as a jazzy scat-singing donkey named 'Moutha Bray'. In 1968, she was awarded the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in the form of an Oscar. After her death the statuette was displayed for many years in a specially constructed lighted niche at the Friars Club in Beverly Hills. On November 2, 1993, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton for her service to her country. The citation reads: > A talented performer whose career spans the better part of a century, Martha > Raye has delighted audiences and uplifted spirits around the globe. She > brought her tremendous comedic and musical skills to her work in film, > stage, and television, helping to shape American entertainment. The great > courage, kindness, and patriotism she showed in her many tours during World > War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War earned her the nickname 'Colonel > Maggie'. The American people honor Martha Raye, a woman who has tirelessly > used her gifts to benefit the lives of her fellow Americans. ===Television career=== She was a television star very early in its history. She starred in the short-lived (28 episodes) The Martha Raye Show (1954‚Äì1956), opposite retired middleweight boxer Rocky Graziano, who played her boyfriend. (Raye was known to call Graziano \\"goombah\\", the Sicilian abbreviation of the Italian 'comp√°r√©' ('cumpari' in Southern Italian - friend, comrade)). The writer and producer was future The Phil Silvers Show creator Nat Hiken. Some of the guest stars on the show were Zsa Zsa Gabor, Cesar Romero, and Broadway dancer Wayne Lamb. She also appeared on other TV shows in the 1950s, such as What's My Line? Following the demise of her TV variety show, the breakup of her fifth marriage, and a series of other personal and health problems, she attempted suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills on August 14, 1956. Well- wishers gave her a St. Christopher's medal, a St. Genesius medal, and a Star of David. After her recovery, she wore these amulets faithfully, although she was neither Catholic nor Jewish. At the conclusion of each episode of her TV shows, she would thank the nuns at the Sisters of St. Francis Hospital in Miami, Florida, where she had recovered. She always said \\"Goodnight, Sisters\\" as a sign of appreciation and gratitude. Later in her career, she made television commercials for Polident denture cleanser, principally during the 1970s and 1980s. ===Later career=== In 1970, she portrayed Boss Witch, the \\"Queen of all Witchdom\\", in the feature film Pufnstuf for Sid and Marty Krofft. This led to her being cast as villainess Benita Bizarre in The Bugaloos (1970), which the Kroffts produced the same year. She often appeared as a guest on other programs, particularly those which often featured older performers as guest stars, such as ABC's The Love Boat, and also on variety programs, including the short-lived The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show. She appeared from the third to the ninth seasons as Carrie Sharples on Alice, making two or three appearances a season. She made guest appearances or did cameo roles in such series as Murder, She Wrote on CBS and The Andy Williams Show and McMillan & Wife, both on NBC. She appeared again as Agatha for the six-episode run of the retooled McMillan, taking over for Nancy Walker, who had left the series. Her last film appearance was as an incontinent airline passenger in the disaster film The Concorde ... Airport '79 (1979). ==Personal life== Raye's personal life was complex and emotionally tumultuous. She was married seven times. Raye was a devout Methodist who regularly attended church, read the Bible daily, and even taught Sunday school classes.Pitrone, Maddern Jean (1999). Take It from the Big Mouth: The Life of Martha Raye Hardcover, The University of Kentucky Press, pp. 220‚Äì221 Because her religious views were often misconstrued throughout her life, she was noted for having said, \\"One paper says I'm Catholic and the other says I'm Jewish. I guess that's fitting because as a Methodist I'm meant to be undetermined some of the time\\". Her engagement to orchestra leader Johnny Torrence was announced in June 1936. Less than two months later she commented, \\"They tell me I've gone Hollywood already because I got engaged to Johnny Torrence one day and broke it off the next.\\" She was married to make-up artist Hamilton \\"Buddy\\" Westmore from May 30, 1937, until September 1937, filing for divorce on the basis of extreme cruelty; to composer-conductor David Rose from October 8, 1938 to May 19, 1941; to Neal Lang from May 25, 1941 to February 3, 1944; to Nick Condos from February 22, 1944 to June 17, 1953; to Edward T. Begley from April 21, 1954 to October 6, 1956; to Robert O'Shea from November 7, 1956 to December 1, 1960; and to Mark Harris from September 25, 1991 until her death in 1994. She had one child, a daughter, Melodye Condos (born July 26, 1944), with fourth husband Condos. Politically, Raye was conservative, affirming her political views by informing an interviewer in 1984, \\"I am a Republican because I believe in the constitution, strength in national defense, limited government, individual freedom, and personal responsibility as the concrete foundation for American government. They reinforce the resolve that the United States is the greatest country in the world and we can all be eternally grateful to our founding fathers for the beautiful legacy they left us today.\\"Interview, The Hollywood Reporter, 1984. Martha Raye was the fifth person to be awarded Honorary Green Beret. While in Vietnam she would assist those in combat hospitals instead of performing because she was a LPN. ===Death=== Raye's final years were plagued by ill health. She had a history of cardiovascular disease and suffered from Alzheimer's disease, in addition to losing both legs in 1993 due to poor circulation. While resting in the hospital bed that was placed in her home, she and her husband Mark Harris (who, because of their controversial May/December relationship, became a frequent guest on the popular Howard Stern radio program) were forced to move into a hotel after their house was destroyed in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Raye died at age 78 of pneumonia on October 19, 1994. In appreciation of her work with the USO during World War II and subsequent wars, special consideration was given to bury her in Arlington National Cemetery on her death. However, based upon her request, she was buried with full military honors in the Fort Bragg, North Carolina, post cemetery as both an honorary colonel in the U.S. Marines and an honorary lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army. Raye has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame‚Äîone for motion pictures at 6251 Hollywood Boulevard and the other for television at 6547 Hollywood Blvd. ==Archive== The moving image collection of Martha Raye is held at the Academy Film Archive. The collection consists of an audio tape and home movies. ==Filmography== ===Film=== * A Nite in a Nite Club (1934, Short) ‚Äì Herself ‚Äì Singer * Rhythm on the Range (1936) ‚Äì Emma Mazda * The Big Broadcast of 1937 (1936) ‚Äì Patsy * Hideaway Girl (1936) ‚Äì Helen Flint * College Holiday (1936) ‚Äì Daisy Schloggenheimer * Waikiki Wedding (1937) ‚Äì Myrtle Finch * Mountain Music (1937) ‚Äì Mary Beamish * Artists & Models (1937) ‚Äì Specialty * Double or Nothing (1937) ‚Äì Liza Lou Lane * Cinema Circus (1937) ‚Äì Herself (archive footage) * The Big Broadcast of 1938 (1938) ‚Äì Martha Bellows * College Swing (1938) ‚Äì Mabel Grady * Tropic Holiday (1938) ‚Äì Midge Miller * Give Me a Sailor (1938) ‚Äì Letty Larkin * Never Say Die (1939) ‚Äì Mickey Hawkins * $1,000 a Touchdown (1939) ‚Äì Martha Madison * The Farmer's Daughter (1940) ‚Äì Patience Bingham * The Boys from Syracuse (1940) ‚Äì Luce * Navy Blues (1941) ‚Äì Lilibelle Bolton * Keep 'Em Flying (1941) ‚Äì Gloria Phelps / Barbara Phelps * Hellzapoppin' (1941) ‚Äì Betty Johnson * Four Jills in a Jeep (1944) ‚Äì Martha Raye * Pin Up Girl (1944) ‚Äì Molly McKay * Monsieur Verdoux (1947) ‚Äì Annabella Bonheur * Billy Rose's Jumbo (1962) ‚Äì Lulu * No Substitute for Victory (1970, Documentary) ‚Äì Herself * The Phynx (1970) ‚Äì Foxy * Pufnstuf (1970) ‚Äì Boss Witch * The Concorde ...

The whiffenpoof itself was a small log, about the size of a stick of firewood, with nails driven into it on all sides, so that it bristled with nails. This was dragged through the forest on a short leash, by the older Scouts who were training the younger. It might thus create a track that the tenderfoot must learn to trace out. Or it might, alternately, be dragged across a trail in order to confuse the trackers. The fewer nails that were driven into it, the more difficult and subtle was the effect. Thus it is that the word whiffenpoof can also refer to an imaginary or indefinite animal; e.g. \\"the great-horned whiffenpoof\\". It originates from an actor's ad-lib in a 1908 performance of the operetta Little Nemo. ==Imaginary or indefinite animal== Particularly among hunters, \\"whiffenpoof\\" can be a tongue-in-cheek name for imaginary animal Tryon, Henry Harrington. \\"The Whiffenpoof.\\" Fearsome Critters.

It was formerly known as Abraham's Mill and was in Essex when built. It has been restored and is a museum open to the public at selected times. ==History== The mill was built for James Nokes of Hunt's Farm in Corbets Tey Road in 1803 on land transferred from Bridge House Farm which was owned by his brother William. It had four Common sails and drove three pairs of millstones. A steam engine was added early in 1811 driving two pairs of millstones, an action which increased the rateable value of the mill from ¬£30 to ¬£77. A fourth pair of millstones was added to the mill. James Nokes died in 1838 and the mill passed to his son Thomas. A fifth pair of millstones had been added by 1849 when Thomas Nokes was bankrupt. By 1856 the mill was driving six pairs of millstones by wind and steam. Thomas Abraham purchased the mill in 1857, having previously been in the employ of Nokes at both West Thurrock windmill and Upminster. He had also been in business at a steam mill in Navestock for the previous two years. In 1876, the Upright Shaft was broken in an accident at the mill. It was repaired with a cast-iron coupling. Thomas Abraham died in 1882 and the mill passed to John Arkell Abraham. In 1889 the mill was struck by lightning and on 5 January 1900 the windshaft snapped at the neck and the sails crashed to the ground. A windshaft from a post mill near Maldon was fitted along with four new sails. After the death of John Arkell Abraham, the mill passed to his nephews Thomas, Alfred and Clement. In 1927 a stock was replaced and the fantail repaired. The mill last worked commercially in 1934 and was purchased for ¬£3,400 by W H Simmonds. The steam driven machinery was sold and the associated outbuildings decayed and were eventually demolished. The mill was listed in 1955 On 22 June 2004, the Upminster Windmill Preservation Trust were granted a 35-year lease on the mill. On 18 January 2007, the windmill suffered damage in extremely high winds. The stock sustained damage as did the sail, but there was little other damage to the mill. Two new sails were fitted by Vincent Pargeter in August 2008. ==Description== The mill has a four-storey smock on a single- storey brick base. There is a stage at first-floor level. It has a boat-shaped cap with a gallery, winded by a six-bladed fantail. Four Patent sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft. The mill drives four pairs of millstones by wind. The mill is in height to the top of the cap. ===Base=== The brick base is across the flats and high. The brickwork is thick at ground level, diminishing to at the top. ===Smock=== The four-storey smock has cant posts of by section, long. the sills are by in section, long. The spout floor is across the flats, the stone floor is across the flats and the top of the smock tower is diameter at the curb. The main floor beams are square at all levels except the dust floor. The main transoms are by in section at all levels. ===Cap and fantail=== The cap, fantail and sails in June 2006. The boat-shaped cap is by in plan and high. The main sheer beams are square, on centres. with the weatherbeam of by section at the centre and square at the ends. The cap is thought to be the work of the millwright William Bear of Ballingdon. The fantail consists of six wooden vanes set at right-angles to the sails, and has the year 1799 carved on the horizontal wooden beam beneath it. ===Sails and windshaft=== The Brake Wheel and Wallower The octagonal cast-iron windshaft has two square sections to take a Head Wheel and Tail Wheel as was its intended purpose in a post mill, and was moved to Upminster from a post mill near Maldon in 1899 to replace one broken during a storm. It carries a diameter composite Brake Wheel with eight cast-iron arms and six wooden cants. The Brake Wheel has 78 cogs. The neck bearing of the windshaft is a roller bearing, fitted after the mill ceased working commercially. Originally Upminster windmall had canvas sails, but the sails on the mill when it ceased working commercially were four double Patent sails. They were carried on two stocks long, square at the centre, tapering to by at the ends. The sails were in span, and tapered from wide at the heel to at the tip. Each sail had twelve bays with three shutters per bay, giving a total of 288 shutters, each carved with a number in Roman numerals to indicate its location. The weather on the sails was 23Àö at the heel and almost 0Àö at the tip. ===Machinery=== The universal joint in the Upright Shaft The Compass Arm Great Spur Wheel The Upright Shaft is wooden, in two sections for reasons noted above. It is twelve sided, across the flats and long in total. The Wallower is of compass arm construction, diameter with 43 cogs. At the bottom of the Upright shaft the diameter compass arm Great Spur Wheel has 126 cogs. It drives four pairs of underdrift millstones via stone nuts with 24 cogs. The millstones are three pairs of French Burr stones and one pair of Peak stones. Two pairs of the French Burr stones are diameter and the other two pairs of millstones are diameter. ===Steam engine=== The steam engine was located in a brick building built against the north-east side of the windmill, and drove two pairs of millstones, a centrifugal governor, and a sack hoist. The steam driven millstones were located on 2 levels and driven by a square shaft of length, those on the upper floor being driven by a cast-iron bevel wheel with wooden cog inserts. It was also able to work various dressing machines in the windmill, but not the wind driven stones. There is some difference over the exact type of engine, it being variously described as a grasshopper engine built by Napiers, and a Cornish boiler by Davey Paxman & Co. Both sources agree that the engine had formerly been used in a Thames steamboat. The steam engine itself was removed in 1940 and taken to South West Essex Technical College in Walthamstow, while the building and remaining contents were removed in 1960 with two of the millstones remaining at the windmill entrance. ==Millers== *James Nokes 1803‚Äì1838 *Thomas Nokes 1838‚Äì1849 *Thomas Abraham 1857‚Äì1882 *John Arkell Abraham 1882‚Äì1912 *Thomas, Alfred and Clement Abraham 1912‚Äì1934 References for above:- ==Location== The mill is located in a small open space maintained by Havering Council, known as Windmill Field on St Mary's Lane.

Now in 3rd edition. These rules allow entire armies to be represented by less than 50 figures. The rules also include diagrams and over 600 army lists. DBA is produced by the Wargames Research Group and was the first game in the DBx series, which now includes De Bellis Multitudinis (DBM), De Bellis Magistrorum Militum (DBMM, a successor or alternative to DBM), Hordes of the Things (a fantasy version), De Bellis Renationis (DBR, a Renaissance version). and for 1700-1920 Horse Foot and Guns (HFG) An online video game titled DBA Online was also created. ==Scale and basing== Scale: Each army is composed of 12 elements (stands), with several figures fixed upon each one. The number of men represented by an element varies according to the size of the army simulated and the number of figures that it has, but at a nominal ground it would be more or less 250 for each figure. Ground scale is 1\\" = 100 paces for 15 mm figures or smaller, 40 mm = 100 paces for 25/28 mm figures. One turn, called a bound in the rules, represents 15 minutes. Can be used with 25/28 mm, 15 mm, 6 mm, or 2 mm figures (54mm and larger a possible with increased base size). Basing: The width of the base depends upon the scale of figures being used; the depth depends upon both figure scale and type. The number of figures per base also depends upon the figure's type. For instance, an element of 15 mm swordsmen is composed of 4 figures mounted on a 40 mm (frontage) x 15 mm (depth) base; a 15 mm elephant is mounted alone on a 40 mm x 40 mm base. == History of the rules == DBA traces its origin back to a two-page experimental set of rules by Phil Barker dubbed De Bellis Societatis Antiquorum that was demonstrated at the Society of Ancients (after whom these experimental rules were named) conferences for 1988 and 1989.http://reg-games.net/DBA.html Many rulesets at that time (including Phil Barker's WRG series of ancients rules) had added greater and greater detail regarding weapons and armor, movement and orders. Many gamers perceived that this increased complexity came at a cost in playability. The De Bellis Societatis Antiquorum ruleset was designed as a \\"tonic for the jaded\\" with the goal of providing a fun, fast and challenging game and as an alternative to the WRG series of ancients rules. The first commercial edition of DBA was published in 1990, with Phil and Sue Barker and Richard Bodley Scott as its authors. The game has continued to evolve over the years; the most recent version was published in November, 2014 with just Phil Barker and Sue Laflin Barker as authors. * DBA 1.0, 1990 * DBA 1.1, March 1995 * DBA 1.2, 1998 (Issued as a set of amendments) * DBA 1.22, 1999 (Issued as a set of amendments) * DBA 2.0, February 2001 * DBA 2.1, 2003 (Issued as a set of amendments) * DBA 2.2, January 2004 * There have been many variants of the game, one is DBA 2.2+, 2012 (Issued by WADBAG, unofficial) * DBA 3.0, November 2014 ==Online version== An online version known as DBAOL (DBA On-Line) was published by Wargaming.net in 2000, based upon DBA v1.2 and upgraded to 1.22. However the online version of the game was not been upgraded to match newer versions of DBA, and the website announced that it is closing down from 1 December 2019 DBAOL home page on Wayback Machine captured October 31 2019. ==Gameplay== Players use a single six-sided die each, and games are played on a square field, which conventionally (though not necessarily) has sides that are roughly sixteen times the base width being used. Though the exact details differ in different editions of the game, in the current version players roll dice to determine who will be the invader and who will be the defender. The defender uses a random process to place terrain according to his army's home territory, and the invader chooses which side his army will enter the board. The players then alternate in placing their camp model and armies, and the defender takes the first bound. Players then alternate bounds. At the start of each bound, the active player dices for \\"PIPs\\". PIPs are the spots on a die. The number of PIPs rolled represents the player's level of control for the turn. Players spend their PIPs to move single elements or connected groups of elements on the game board. PIPs do not carry over from turn to turn. PIPs simulate (though not model) the difficulties of command and control during a battle, and players find that once battle is joined, they often need to spend all of their available PIPs shoring up their battle line, with few PIPs left over for maneuver of un-engaged elements. After making any such desired moves, the players then conduct combat, both ranged and close combat, adjudicated in the order specified by the active player. Combat is resolved per-element, in the order desired by the active player. To resolve combat, each player throws one die and adds modifiers for both troop type and battlefield situation (such as being outflanked or up hill). The higher roll wins the combat and results are applied immediately, before the next combat is decided. Achieving a roll twice as high as your opponent generally destroys that opponent, with lesser successes merely pushing the opponent back out of the line of battle. Note that since results are applied immediately, shrewd players resolve combats whose results can give them advantages against other elements in future combats. Once all combats have been resolved, the other player takes their turn. The game continues in this way until one of the players achieves the win condition - the destruction of 1/3 of the enemy's army. In the event of a tie at the end of bound, play continues until the end of a bound where one player has lost more than the opponent. ==Criticisms== Some players have found Phil Barker's succinct rule writing style to be difficult to decipher, referring to it as \\"Barkerese\\". The current version involved many players giving the author advice to improve the format and readability. Due to the nature of DBA's combat system, DBA is often criticized as being over-\\"geometric\\", as elements are matched up in precise ways, and base widths must match up with some precision. Many of the improvements in the various editions of DBA have been to address geometric concerns and \\"millimetrics\\". ==External links== * Fanaticus Online community of DBA players (Archived) * DBA Online An online version of the game * Google Plus Community * DBA on Yahoo!

He is known, among other things, for his experiments with pendulums and with falling bodies, for his discussion of 126 arguments concerning the motion of the Earth, and for introducing the current scheme of lunar nomenclature. He is also widely known for discovering the first double star. He argued that the rotation of the Earth should reveal itself because on a rotating Earth, the ground moves at different speeds at different times. == Biography == Riccioli as portrayed in the 1742 Atlas Coelestis (plate 3) of Johann Gabriel Doppelmayer. Riccioli was born in Ferrara, Italy.His books sometimes bear the mention \\"Ricciolus Ferrariensis\\" (Riccioli of Ferrara). He entered the Society of Jesus on October 6, 1614. After completing his novitiate, he began to study humanities in 1616, pursuing those studies first at Ferrara, and then at Piacenza. From 1620 to 1628 he studied philosophy and theology at the College of Parma. Parma Jesuits had developed a strong program of experimentation, such as with falling bodies. One of the most famous Italian Jesuits of the time, Giuseppe Biancani (1565‚Äì1624), was teaching at Parma when Riccioli arrived there. Biancani accepted new astronomical ideas, such as the existence of lunar mountains and the fluid nature of the heavens, and collaborated with the Jesuit astronomer Christoph Scheiner (1573‚Äì1650) on sunspot observations. Riccioli mentions him with gratitude and admiration.He was later to name a lunar crater after Biancani, among a host of men of science and astronomers, Jesuits and non-Jesuits. By 1628 Riccioli's studies were complete and he was ordained. He requested missionary work, but that request was turned down. Instead, he was assigned to teach at Parma. There he taught logic, physics, and metaphysics from 1629 to 1632, and engaged in some experiments with falling bodies and pendulums. In 1632 he became a member of a group charged with the formation of younger Jesuits, among whom Daniello Bartoli.Riccioli 1669, IV, p. 218 (under D for Daniel Bartholus Ferrariensis) He spent the 1633‚Äì1634 academic year in Mantua, where he collaborated with Niccolo Cabeo (1576‚Äì1650) in further pendulum studies. In 1635 he was back at Parma, where he taught theology and also carried out his first important observation of the Moon. In 1636 he was sent to Bologna to serve as Professor of theology. Riccioli described himself as a theologian, but one with a strong and ongoing interest in astronomy since his student days, when he studied under Biancani. He said that many Jesuits were theologians, but few were astronomers. He said that once the enthusiasm for astronomy arose within him he could never extinguish it, and so he became more committed to astronomy than theology. Eventually his superiors in the Jesuit order officially assigned him to the task of astronomical research. However, he also continued to write on theology (see below). Riccioli built an astronomical observatory in Bologna at the College of St. Lucia, equipped with many instruments for astronomical observations, including telescopes, quadrants, sextants, and other traditional instruments. Riccioli dealt not only with astronomy in his research, but also with physics, arithmetic, geometry, optics, gnomonics, geography, and chronology. He collaborated with others in his work, including other Jesuits, most notably Francesco Maria Grimaldi (1618‚Äì1663) at Bologna, and he kept up a voluminous correspondence with others who shared his interests, including Hevelius, Huygens, Cassini, and Kircher. He was awarded a prize by Louis XIV in recognition of his activities and their relevance to contemporary culture. Riccioli continued to publish on both astronomy and theology up to his death. He died in Bologna at 73 years of age.Material in the \\"Biography\\" section has been compiled from Dinis 2003; Dinis 2002; Catholic Encyclopedia: Giovanni Battista Riccioli. == Scientific work == ===Almagestum Novum=== The crescent phases of Venus and detailed representations of its appearance as seen through a telescope, from Riccioli's 1651 New Almagest.Riccioli 1651 (Volume 1, p. 485). One of Riccioli's most significant works was his 1651 Almagestum Novum (New Almagest),The old Almagest was Ptolemy's 2nd-century book. an encyclopedic work consisting of over 1500 folio pages (38 cm x 25 cm) densely packed with text, tables, and illustrations. It became a standard technical reference book for astronomers all over Europe: John Flamsteed (1646‚Äì1719), the first English astronomer royal, a Copernican and a Protestant, used it for his Gresham lectures; J√©r√¥me Lalande (1732‚Äì1807) of the Paris Observatory cited it extensivelyBut not necessarily favorably‚Äîsome discussion of Lalande citing Riccioli is available in Galloway 1842 (pp. 93-97). even though it was an old book at that point; the 1912 Catholic Encyclopedia calls it the most important literary work of the Jesuits during the seventeenth century.Van Helden 1984 (p. 103); Raphael 2011 (pp. 73-76), which includes the quote about \\"no serious seventeenth century astronomer\\" on p. 76; Campbell 1921 (p. 848); Catholic Encyclopedia: Giovanni Battista Riccioli. Within its two volumes were ten \\"books\\" covering every subject within astronomy and related to astronomy at the time: #the celestial sphere and subjects such as celestial motions, the equator, ecliptic, zodiac, etc. #the Earth and its size, gravity and pendulum motion, etc. #the Sun, its size and distance, its motion, observations involving it, etc. #the Moon, its phases, its size and distance, etc. (detailed maps of the Moon as seen through a telescope were included) #lunar and solar eclipses #the fixed stars #the planets and their motions, etc. (representations of each as seen with a telescope were included); #comets and novae (\\"new stars\\") #the structure of the universe‚Äîthe heliocentric and geocentric theories, etc. #calculations related to astronomy. Riccioli envisioned that the New Almagest would have three volumes, but only the first (with its 1500 pages split into two parts) was completed. ====Pendulums and falling bodies==== Riccioli is credited with being the first person to precisely measure the acceleration due to gravity of falling bodies.Koyr√© 1955 (p. 349); Graney 2012. Books 2 and 9 of the New Almagest Riccioli included a significant discussion of and extensive experimental reports on the motions of falling bodies and pendulums. He was interested in the pendulum as a device for precisely measuring time. By counting the number of pendulum swings that elapsed between transits of certain stars, Riccioli was able to experimentally verify that the period of a pendulum swinging with small amplitude is constant to within two swings out of 3212 (0.062%). He also reported that a pendulum's period increases if the amplitude of its swing is increased to 40 degrees. He sought to develop a pendulum whose period was precisely one second ‚Äì such a pendulum would complete 86,400 swings in a 24-hour period. This he directly tested, twice, by using stars to mark time and recruiting a team of nine fellow Jesuits to count swings and maintain the amplitude of swing for 24 hours. The results were pendulums with periods within 1.85%, and then 0.69%, of the desired value; and Riccioli even sought to improve on the latter value. The seconds pendulum was then used as a standard for calibrating pendulums with different periods. Riccioli said that for measuring time a pendulum was not a perfectly reliable tool, but in comparison with other methods it was an exceedingly reliable tool.Meli 2006 (pp. 131-134); Heilbron 1999 (pp.180-181). With pendulums to keep time (sometimes augmented by a chorus of Jesuits chanting in time with a pendulum to provide an audible timer) and a tall structure in the form of Bologna's Torre de Asinelli from which to drop objects, Riccioli was able to engage in precise experiments with falling bodies. He verified that falling bodies followed Galileo's \\"odd-number\\" rule so that the distance travelled by a falling body increases in proportion to the square of the time of fall, indicative of constant acceleration.An algebra-free explanation of the \\"odd- number\\" rule and distance increasing as the square of time: An object accelerating from rest (or zero speed) so that its speed steadily increases by 2 feet per second with every passing second, will, after one second has elapsed, be moving at 2 ft/s. Its average speed will be 1 ft/sec (the average of zero and 2 ft/s); therefore, having averaged 1 ft/s for 1 second, it will have traveled one foot. After two seconds have elapsed, the object will be moving at 4 ft/s, its average speed will be 2 ft/sec (the average of 0 ft/s and 4 ft/s); and, having averaged 2 ft/s for 2 seconds, it will have traveled four feet. After three seconds have elapsed the object will be moving at 6 ft/s, its average speed will be 3 ft/sec, and it will have traveled nine feet. After four seconds it will have traveled sixteen feet. Thus the distance the object travels increases as the square of elapsed time: (1 sec, 1 ft); (2 sec, 4 ft); (3 sec, 9 ft); (4 sec, 16 ft). Moreover, since, during the first second the object travels 1 ft, and during the next second it travels 4 ft ‚Äì 1 ft = 3 ft, and during the third 9 ft ‚Äì 4 ft = 5 ft, and during the fourth 16 ft ‚Äì 9 ft = 7 ft, then the distance the object travels during each subsequent second follows an \\"odd-number\\" rule: 1 ft; 3 ft; 5 ft; 7 ft. According to Riccioli, a falling body released from rest travels 15 Roman feet (4.44 m) in one second, 60 feet (17.76 m) in two seconds, 135 feet (39.96 m) in three seconds, etc.Meli 2006 (pp. 131-134); Heilbron 1999 (pp.180-181); Koyr√© 1955 (p. 356). Other Jesuits such as the above-mentioned Cabeo had argued that this rule had not been rigorously demonstrated.Meli 2006 (p. 122). His results showed that, while falling bodies generally showed constant acceleration, there were differences determined by weight and size and density. Riccioli said that if two heavy objects of differing weight are dropped simultaneously from the same height, the heavier one descends more quickly so long as it is of equal or greater density; if both objects are of equal weight the denser one descends more quickly. For example, in dropping balls of wood and lead that both weighed 2.5 ounces, Riccioli found that upon the leaden ball having traversed 280 Roman feet the wooden ball had traversed only 240 feet (a table in the New Almagest contains data on twenty one such paired drops). He attributed such differences to the air, and noted that air density had to be considered when dealing with falling bodies.Meli 2006 (pp. 132-134); Koyr√© 1955 (p. 352). He illustrated the reliability of his experiments by providing detailed descriptions of how they were carried out, so that anyone could reproduce them,Meli 2006 (p. 132). Riccioli's results are generally consistent with a modern understanding of bodies falling under the influence of gravity and air drag. His 15-60-135 values imply a gravitational acceleration \\"g\\" of 30 Roman feet per second per second (30 Rmft/s/s). The modern accepted value (g = 9.8 m/s/s) expressed in Roman feet is g = 33 Rmft/s/s; Riccioli's \\"g\\" differs from the accepted value by less than 10%. His statements about balls that are more dense, etc. reaching the ground first (that is, being less affected by air drag) agree with modern understanding. His result that a wooden ball fell 240 feet in the time a lead ball of the same weight fell 280 feet is generally consistent with modern understanding (although the 40 ft difference is somewhat less than expected). complete with diagrams of the Torre de Asinelli that showed heights, drop locations, etc.Raphael 2011 (82-86). Riccioli noted that while these differences did contradict Galileo's claim that balls of differing weight would fall at the same rate, it was possible Galileo observed the fall of bodies made of the same material but of differing sizes, for in that case the difference in fall time between the two balls is much smaller than if the balls are of same size but differing materials, or of the same weight but differing sizes, etc., and that difference is not apparent unless the balls are released from a very great height.Koyr√© 1955 (p. 352). At the time, various people had expressed concern with Galileo's ideas about falling bodies, arguing that it would be impossible to discern the small differences in time and distance needed to adequately test Galileo's ideas, or reporting that experiments had not agreed with Galileo's predictions, or complaining that suitably tall buildings with clear paths of fall were not available to thoroughly test Galileo's ideas. By contrast, Riccioli was able to show that he had carried out repeated, consistent, precise experiments in an ideal location.Raphael 2011 (pp. 82-86). Thus as D. B. Meli notes, > Riccioli's accurate experiments were widely known during the second half of > the [seventeenth] century and helped forge a consensus on the empirical > adequacy of some aspects of Galileo's work, especially the odd-number rule > and the notion that heavy bodies fall with similar accelerations and speed > is not proportional to weight. His limited agreement with Galileo was > significant, coming as it did from an unsympathetic reader who had gone so > far as to include the text of Galileo's condemnation in his own > publications.Meli 2006 (p. 134). ====Work concerning the Moon==== Map of the Moon from the New Almagest. Riccioli and Grimaldi extensively studied the Moon, of which Grimaldi drew maps. This material was included in Book 4 of the New Almagest.Riccioli 1651, pages 203 - 205 including map pages. Grimaldi's maps were based on earlier work by Johannes Hevelius and Michael Van Langren. On one of these maps, Riccioli provided names for lunar features‚Äînames that are the basis for the nomenclature of lunar features still in use today. For example, Mare Tranquillitatis (The Sea of Tranquility, site of the Apollo 11 landing in 1969), received its name from Riccioli. Riccioli named large lunar areas for weather. He named craters for significant astronomers, grouping them by philosophies and time periods.Bolt 2007 (pp. 60-61). Although Riccioli rejected the Copernican theory, he named a prominent lunar crater \\"Copernicus\\", and he named other important craters after other proponents of the Copernican theory such as Kepler, Galileo and Lansbergius. Because craters that he and Grimaldi named after themselves are in the same general vicinity as these, while craters named for some other Jesuit astronomers are in a different part of the Moon, near the very prominent crater named for Tycho Brahe, Riccioli's lunar nomenclature has at times been considered to be a tacit expression of sympathy for a Copernican theory that, as a Jesuit, he could not publicly support.Whitaker 1999 (p. 65). However, Riccioli said he put the Copernicans all in stormy waters (the Oceanus Procellarum).Bolt 2007 (p. 61). Another noteworthy feature of the map is that Riccioli included on it a direct statement that the Moon is not inhabited. This ran counter to speculations about an inhabited Moon that had been present in the works of Nicholas of Cusa, Giordano Bruno, and even Kepler, and which would continue on in works of later writers such as Bernard de Fontenelle and William Herschel.Crowe 2008 (pp. 2, 550).Trois cent cinquante ann√©es de noms lunaires ====Arguments concerning the motion of the Earth==== Frontispiece of Riccioli's 1651 New Almagest. Mythological figures observe the heavens with a telescope and weigh the heliocentric theory of Copernicus in a balance against his modified version of Tycho Brahe's geo-heliocentric system, in which the Sun, Moon, Jupiter, and Saturn orbit the Earth while Mercury, Venus, and Mars orbit the Sun. The old Ptolemaic geocentric theory lies discarded on the ground, made obsolete by the telescope's discoveries. These are illustrated at top and include phases of Venus and Mercury and a surface feature on Mars (left), moons of Jupiter, rings of Saturn, and features on the Moon (right). The balance tips in favor of Riccioli's \\"Tychonic\\" system. A substantial portion of the New Almagest (Book 9, consisting of 343 pages) is devoted to an analysis of the world system question: Is the universe geocentric or heliocentric? Does the Earth move or is it immobile? The historian of science Edward Grant has described Book 9 as being the \\"probably the lengthiest, most penetrating, and authoritative\\" analysis of this question made by \\"any author of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\\",Grant 1996 (p. 652). in his opinion apparently superseding even Galileo's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems ‚Äî Ptolemaic and Copernican. Indeed, one writer has recently described Book 9 as \\"the book Galileo was supposed to write\\".The TOF Spot. Within Book 9 Riccioli discusses 126 arguments concerning Earth's motion‚Äî49 for and 77 against. To Riccioli the question was not between the geocentric world system of Ptolemy and the heliocentric world system of Copernicus, for the telescope had unseated the Ptolemaic system; it was between the geo-heliocentric world system developed by Tycho Brahe in the 1570sGingerich 1973. (in which the Sun, Moon, and stars circle an immobile Earth, while the planets circle the Sun ‚Äì sometimes called a \\"geo- heliocentric\\" or \\"hybrid\\" system) and that of Copernicus. As the frontispiece of the New Almagest illustrates (see figure at right), Riccioli favoured a modified version of Tycho Brahe's system; here is how he described the system that \\"came to [his] mind\\" when he was in Parma : \\"it shares everything with the Tychonian system, except the orbits of Saturn and Jupiter; for [me] their center was not the Sun, but Earth itself\\". New Almagest, Book 6 De Sole Many writers make references to Riccioli's analysis and the 126 arguments. However, translations of arguments of the New Almagest, and discussions of the arguments to any extent by more modern writers are rare: only for three arguments of the 126 are such translations and discussions readily available.Synopses of the 126 arguments have been translated into French (Delambre 1821, pp. 674-679) and English ( 2011, pp. 37-95), but these are very abbreviated, reducing hundreds of pages of Latin text down to some few pages or tens of pages. These are, first, an argument Riccioli called the \\"physico-mathematical argument\\", which was related to one of Galileo's conjectures; second, an argument based on what today is known as the \\"Coriolis effect\\"; third, an argument based on the appearance of stars as seen through the telescopes of the time. The \\"physico-mathematical\\" argument Riccioli discusses the physico-mathematical argument in terms of arguments both for and against Earth's motion. Galileo offered a conjecture in his 1632 Dialogue that the apparent linear acceleration of a stone falling from a tower was the result of two uniform circular motions acting in combination ‚Äì the daily rotation of Earth, and a second uniform circular motion belonging to the stone and acquired from being carried along by the tower.Dinis 2002 (p. 63); arXiv:1103.2057v2 (p. 21). Galileo says that > [T]he true and real motion of the stone is never accelerated at all, but is > always equable and uniform.... So we need not look for any other causes of > acceleration or any other motions, for the moving body, whether remaining on > the tower or falling, moves always in the same manner; that is, circularly, > with the same rapidity, and with the same uniformity.... if the line > described by a falling body is not exactly this, it is very near to it... > [and] according to these considerations, straight motion goes entirely out > the window and nature never makes any use of it at all.Dialogue 2001 (pp. > 193-194). Riccioli explained that this conjecture could not work: It could not apply to the fall of bodies near the Earth's poles, where there would be little or no circular motion caused by Earth's rotation; and even at the equator where there would be more motion caused by Earth's rotation, the rate of fall predicted by Galileo's idea was too slow.Koyr√© 1955 (pp. 354-355). Riccioli argued that the problems with Galileo's conjecture were a mark against the Copernican world system, but modern writers differ in regards to Riccioli's reasoning on this.Dinis (2002) says Riccioli misrepresented Galileo's conjecture, stating that > The whole \\"Galilean proof\\" [of Earth's immobility] as constructed and > \\"proved\\" by Riccioli is nothing but a caricature even of Galileo's > [conjecture] ‚Äì let alone Galileo's true thought on the matter! and declaring that Riccioli's \\"proof\\" could never be anything more than another conjecture (pp. 64-65). Koyr√© (1955) concurs that Riccioli's \\"physico- mathematical\\" argument was weak, but says Riccioli simply had difficulty grasping new ideas, or adapting old ones (such as the relativity of motion) to new conceptions, such as the motion of the Earth. Koyr√© emphasizes that this was a problem shared by many in the seventeenth century, so the argument could impress even an \\"acute mind\\" of the time (pp. 354, 352 including notes). Graney (arXiv:1103.2057v2 2011) states that Galileo's conjecture suggested a possible new physics that would explain motion in the Copernican theory in an elegant and coherent manner and therefore would strengthened the theory. By undermining Galileo's conjecture, Riccioli's experiment-based argument deprived the theory of that coherence and elegance (pp. 21-22). The \\"coriolis effect\\" argument Illustration from Riccioli's 1651 New Almagest showing the effect a rotating Earth should have on projectiles.Riccioli 1651 (Volume 2, p. 426). When the cannon is fired at eastern target B, cannon and target both travel east at the same speed while the ball is in flight. The ball strikes the target just as it would if the Earth were immobile. When the cannon is fired at northern target E, the target moves more slowly to the east than the cannon and the airborne ball, because the ground moves more slowly at more northern latitudes (the ground hardly moves at all near the pole). Thus the ball follows a curved path over the ground, not a diagonal, and strikes to the east, or right, of the target at G. Riccioli also argued that the rotation of the Earth should reveal itself in the flight of artillery projectiles, because on a rotating Earth the ground moves at different speeds at different latitudes. He wrote that > If a ball is fired along a Meridian toward the pole (rather than toward the > East or West), diurnal motion will cause the ball to be carried off [that > is, the trajectory of the ball will be deflected], all things being equal: > for on parallels of latitude nearer the poles, the ground moves more slowly, > whereas on parallels nearer the equator, the ground moves more > rapidly.Graney 2011 Therefore, were a cannon, aimed directly at a target to the north, to fire a ball, that ball would strike slightly to the east (right) of the target, thanks to the Earth's rotation.(in the northern hemisphere) But, if the cannon were fired to the east there would be no deflection, as both cannon and target would move the same distance in the same direction. Riccioli said that the best of cannoneers could fire a ball right into the mouth of an enemy's cannon; if this deflection effect existed in northward shots they would have detected it. Riccioli argued that the absence of this effect indicated that the Earth does not rotate. He was correct in his reasoning in that the effect he describes actually does occur. It is known today as the Coriolis effect after the nineteenth-century physicist Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis (1792‚Äì1843).Grant 1984 (p. 50); Graney 2011; New Scientist 2011; Discovery News 2011. However, the rightward(in the northern hemisphere) deflection actually occurs regardless of the direction the cannon is pointed (a much more developed understanding of physics than what was available in Riccioli's time is required to explain this).Wikipedia: Coriolis Effect. At any rate, the effect would have been too small for cannoneers of the time to detect. The star size argument Riccioli also used telescopic observations of stars to argue against the Copernican theory. Viewed through the small telescopes of his time, stars appeared as small but distinct disks. These disks were spurious ‚Äì caused by the diffraction of waves of light entering the telescope. Today they are known as Airy disks, after the nineteenth-century astronomer George Biddell Airy (1801‚Äì1892). The real disks of stars are generally too tiny to be seen even with the best of modern telescopes. But during most of the seventeenth century it was thought that these disks seen in a telescope were the actual bodies of stars.Graney & Grayson 2011. In the Copernican theory, the stars had to lie at vast distances from Earth in order to explain why no annual parallax was seen among them. Riccioli and Grimaldi made numerous measurements of star disks using a telescope, providing a detailed description of their procedure so that anyone who wanted could replicate it. Riccioli then calculated the physical sizes that the measured stars would need to have in order for them both to be as far away as was required in the Copernican theory to show no parallax, and to have the sizes seen with the telescope. The result in all cases was that the stars were huge ‚Äì dwarfing the sun. In some scenarios one single star would exceed the size of the entire universe as estimated by a geocentrist like Tycho Brahe. This problem that the appearance of stars in the telescope posed for the Copernican theory had been noted as early as 1614 by Simon Marius, who said telescopic observations of the disks of stars supported the Tychonic theory. The problem was acknowledged by Copernicans such as Martin van den Hove (1605‚Äì1639), who also measured the disks of stars and acknowledged that the issue of vast star sizes might lead people to reject the Copernican theory.Graney 2010a. Other arguments The other arguments Riccioli presents in Book 9 of the New Almagest were diverse. There were arguments concerning: whether buildings could stand or birds could fly if Earth rotated; what sorts of motions were natural to heavy objects; what constitutes the more simple and elegant celestial arrangement; whether the heavens or the Earth was the more suited for motion and the more easily and economically moved; whether the center of the universe was a more or less noble position; and many others. Many of the anti-Copernican arguments in the New Almagest had roots in the anti-Copernican arguments of Tycho Brahe.Grant 1984; arXiv:1103.2057v2. Riccioli argued vigorously against the Copernican system, and even characterized certain arguments for terrestrial immobility as unanswerable, but he also rebutted some anti-Copernican arguments, invoking counterarguments from the Copernicans. For example, he presents the common opinion that, if the Earth rotated, we ought to feel it, and since we do not, the Earth must be immobile. But he then says that mathematically there is no necessity for such a sensation. He likewise dismisses the ideas that buildings might be ruined or birds left behind by Earth's motion‚Äîall may simply share the eastward rotational motion of Earth, like the east-facing cannon and ball discussed above.Grant 1984 (pp. 14-15); arXiv:1103.2057v2 (pp. 73-74, 80-81). Perhaps for this reason Riccioli has at times been portrayed as a secret Copernican‚Äîsomeone whose position as a Jesuit necessitated opposition to the Copernican theory.Grant 1984 (pp. 14-15); Dinis 2002 (pp. 49-50). ===The Astronomia Reformata (Reformed Astronomy)=== Another prominent astronomical publication of Riccioli's was his 1665 Astronomia Reformata (Reformed Astronomy)‚Äîanother large volume, although only half the length of the New Almagest. The contents of the two significantly overlap; the Reformed Astronomy might be thought of as a condensed and updated version of the New Almagest. Representations from Riccioli's 1665 Reformed Astronomy of Saturn's changing appearance.Riccioli 1665 (pp. 362-363). The Reformed Astronomy contains an extensive report on the changing appearance of Saturn.Riccioli 1665 (pp. 362-363). Included in the section on Jupiter is an apparent record of a very early (if not the earliest)Textbooks typically date the discovery of the spot to the 1650s. See, for example, Comins and Kaufmann 2009 (p. 454). observation of Jupiter's Great Red Spot, made by Leander Bandtius, Abbot of Dunisburgh and owner of a particularly fine telescope, in late 1632. Also in that section Riccioli includes reports of Jovian cloud belts appearing and disappearing over time.Graney 2010b. Similar changes in the Jovian clouds belts occurred in 2010 (New Scientist 2010; BBC News 2010). The appearance of the physico-mathematical argument in the Reformed Astronomy was the occasion for Stefano degli Angeli (1623‚Äì1697) to launch an \\"unexpected, somewhat disrespectful and sometimes flippant attack\\"Koyr√© 1955 (p. 366). on Riccioli and the argument. James Gregory published a report in England in 1668 on the resulting public and personal dispute on the matter of falling objects. This was a prelude to Robert Hooke's (1635‚Äì1703) invitation to Isaac Newton (1642‚Äì1727) to resume his scientific correspondence with the Royal Society, and to their ensuing discussion about the trajectory of falling bodies \\"that turned Newton's mind away from 'other business' and back to the study of terrestrial and celestial mechanics.\\"Koyr√© 1955 (pp. 329, 354, 395). The Reformed Astronomy featured an adaptation to the accumulating observational evidence in favor of Johannes Kepler's elliptical celestial mechanics: it incorporated elliptical orbits into the geo-heliocentric Tychonic theory.Heilbron 1999 (p. 122). Riccioli accepted Kepler's ideas, but remained opposed to the heliocentric theory. Indeed, following the dispute with Angeli, Riccioli's attitude toward heliocentrism hardened.Dinis 2003 (p. 213). ===Other work=== Between 1644 and 1656, Riccioli was occupied by topographical measurements, working with Grimaldi, determining values for the circumference of Earth and the ratio of water to land. Defects of method, however, gave a less accurate value for degrees of arc of the meridian than Snellius had achieved a few years earlier. Snellius had been mistaken by approximately 4,000 meters; but Riccioli was more than 10,000 meters in error.Hoefer 1873. Riccioli had come up with 373,000 pedes despite the fact that references to a Roman degree in antiquity had always been 75 milliaria or 375,000 pedes. He is often credited with being one of the first to telescopically observe the star Mizar and note that it was a double star; however, Castelli and Galileo observed it much earlier. In the words of Alfredo Dinis, > Riccioli enjoyed great prestige and great opposition, both in Italy and > abroad, not only as a man of encyclopedic knowledge but also as someone who > could understand and discuss all the relevant issues in cosmology, > observational astronomy, and geography of the time.Dinis 2003 (p. 216). ==Selected works== Riccioli's works are in Latin. === Astronomy === * Geographicae crucis fabrica et usus ad repraesentandam ... omnem dierum noctiumque ortuum solis et occasum (Ferroni: 1643) (Map of the world from Gallica) * Almagestum novum astronomiam veterem novamque complectens observationibus aliorum et propriis novisque theorematibus, problematibus ac tabulis promotam (Vol. I‚ÄìIII, 1651) (Or: Volume 1 : ; ) * , Bologna, 1661 ** . 2nd ed., Venice, 1672. * Astronomia reformata (Vol. I‚ÄìII, 1665) ** : Observations, hypotheses and explanations ** : Directions for use, and the 102 tables * Vindiciae calendarii Gregoriani adversus Franciscum Leveram (1666) * Apologia R.P.

He stood tall and weighed . He was the third pitcher to accumulate 300 career victories. Welch was born in Brooklyn, New York, and played 13 seasons in the major leagues, three with the Troy Trojans, and 10 with the New York Gothams/Giants. He was very successful with an effective curveball, a change of pace, and a version of the screwball. During his 13 major league seasons, he posted 20 or more wins nine times, seven in succession. ==Early life== Welch was born Michael Francis Walsh in Brooklyn, New York, to Irish immigrant parents John and Mary Walsh. He later adopted the last name Welch. The name change may have been spurred by a sportswriter's mistaken recording of the name in a box score. The new last name may have distinguished him from the high number of men in Brooklyn at the time named Michael Walsh. Off the baseball field, Welch used his birth name throughout his life.Fleitz, p. 29. When he was growing up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, baseball was the popular sport among Irish children. Welch recalled that he had to learn unique baseball skills because of his small size; he depended on strong control of his pitches, a good curveball and change-of-pace, and a studious approach to opposing batters. ==Major league career== ===Early career=== Welch's earliest professional baseball engagement was in Poughkeepsie, New York, as an outfielder-pitcher for the Volunteers baseball club in 1877, and in the following year he would briefly play for a club in Auburn before joining the Holyoke Shamrocks of the National Association. During the 1879 season with the Shamrocks, his pitching would be credited to their 23-14 record, during which he was supported by the likes of later MLB players Roger Connor, Larry Corcoran, Jerry Dorgan, Peter Gillespie, and Fergy Malone. In the following year, Welch made his major league debut in , winning 34 games for the Troy Trojans. On July 6, 1880, he pitched a one- hitter against the Cleveland Blues. Welch's totals dipped during the following two seasons, when he began to split starts with Tim Keefe, who also went on to win more than 300 games. The duo would only enjoy moderate success over the course of three seasons with the Trojans, a team that never finished higher than fourth in the National League during its four-season run. After the Trojans disbanded after the season, the New York Gothams replaced them, taking many of the Troy players, including Welch. He resumed a heavy workload in , throwing 426 innings in 54 games. This time he split pitching duties with John Montgomery Ward in what turned out to be Ward's final season as a regular pitcher. In , he went 39-21 with 345 strikeouts and a 2.50 ERA. ===Strikeout record=== Welch holds the record for most consecutive batters struck out to begin a game, with 9, set on August 28, 1884. The record was not recognized for many years because of confusion over a dropped third strike. In the third inning of that game, a third strike was dropped by New York catcher Bill Loughran. As a result, that batter safely reached first base. Though modern scorekeeping credits a pitcher with a strikeout in this situation, such an event was not always recorded as a strikeout by sportswriters of that era. Baseball historian Harry Simmons helped Welch to receive official recognition of the feat in the 1940s. Only three pitchers in the National League and two in the American League have come close to matching Mickey Welch's record nine strikeouts: In the NL: German Marquez (Colorado Rockies) on September 26, 2018, Jacob deGrom (New York Mets) in 2014, and Jim Deshaies (Houston Astros) in 1986 struck out the first eight batters faced; and in the AL: Carlos Rodon (Chicago White Sox) in 2016 and Joe Cowley (Chicago White Sox) in 1986 struck out the first seven batters faced. Tom Seaver struck out 10 consecutive batters in 1970, though not at the beginning of the game. ===Middle career=== Tim Keefe, Welch's longtime teammate In , he went 44‚Äì11 with 258 strikeouts and a 1.66 ERA. In the 1885 season, Welch and Keefe reunited as a two-man pitching rotation, with Keefe having a 32-13 win-loss record. The team, now called the Giants, had an incredible record of 85‚Äì27, with Welch winning 17 consecutive games at one point, but finished second to the Chicago White Stockings, who finished with a record of 87-25. After the 1885 season, Welch was one of nine Giants players to form baseball's first union, which was known as the Brotherhood of Professional Base Ball Players. The players were upset about the way they had been treated by baseball owners. The reserve clause, which restricted player movement and tempered increases in player salaries, had been instituted in 1880. The union spent the next several years recruiting new members and talking about the cause of player salaries.Fleitz, p. 37. Though Welch was still an active player, he began saving money with the goal of opening a hotel.Fleitz, p. 47. In 1886, Welch won 33 games, which was second on the Giants to Keefe's 44 victories. Despite this win total from Welch and Keefe, the team fell to third place in the league. Though they enjoyed a 47‚Äì12 record at the Polo Grounds, they were 28‚Äì32 while on the road that year. As Keefe and Welch were so overworked by 1887, the Giants picked up young pitchers Bill George and Cannonball Titcomb, but both of them struggled and the Giants finished fourth. ===Later career=== On September 10, , he is credited as having become the first pinch hitter in major league history; he batted for Hank O'Day and struck out. Conventional wisdom indicates that this must have been an injury situation since a rule allowing pinch hitters in non- injury situations was not instituted until . The first pinch-hitter under that rule is generally agreed to be Jack Doyle‚Äö on June 7‚Äö 1892. The Giants won the 1889 World Series, but morale was low on the club. Relationships had become strained between players and owners across the league. The league was planning to implement a system of player ratings which would be used to determine player salaries. Welch and the other members of the Brotherhood were outraged by such a system and they began to plan a new baseball league, inviting players to join even if they were not Brotherhood members. The new eight-team league became known as the Players' League.Fleitz, pp. 39. Before the Players' League began its season in 1890, Welch realized that he was coming to the end of his playing career. Saying that he was in baseball to earn money, Welch agreed to re-sign with the Giants on a three-year contract. Welch said that he had been willing to accept $2,000 less to play in the Players' League, but that deal fell through when the league could only guarantee one year of salary. He met with sharp criticism from Jim O'Rourke and other Brotherhood members, but the Players' League lasted only one season.Fleitz, pp. 40-41. On April 24, , with the score tied at 2 in the 7th inning between his Giants and the Boston Beaneaters‚Äö Welch got into an argument with umpire McDermott, an argument that resulted in the umpire declaring the game forfeited to host Boston. With Welch and Keefe still on the same club, the 1891 New York Giants had two 300-game winners. Until the 1980s, this was the only time that a major league team featured two pitchers with 300 wins each. After one start in the 1892 season, Welch was sent to the minor leagues, earning a 16-14 record and a 0.87 ERA for the Eastern League's Troy Trojans. He retired from baseball after the season, having compiled 307 victories, 210 losses, 1850 strikeouts and a career 2.71 ERA. As of 2015, Welch ranks third on the all-time list of career wild pitches. He had unique hitting skills for a pitcher, finishing his career with a .224 batting average, 93 doubles, 16 triples and 12 home runs. In addition to his 607 games pitched, Welch made 59 career appearances as an outfielder. ==Personal life== Author David Fleitz writes that Welch did not swear, smoke or drink hard liquor. Welch liked beer enough that he would write poems about it, reciting them for sportswriters or for fans on the carriage ride to the ballpark on game days. Sometimes his poetry also advertised local bars and restaurants. Welch and his wife Mary had nine children, two of which died in infancy. Mary died in 1936. ==After baseball== Welch's plaque at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum After retiring as a player, Welch lived in Holyoke, Massachusetts. He joined an Elks lodge and remained in the organization for more than 50 years. He owned a saloon for a while and after he sold it, he went into the dairy business with one of his sons. Welch spent summers in New York. He worked as an attendant at the Polo Grounds. In a 1911 book on baseball history, Welch was described as the owner of a hotel in Troy, New York. Welch and Keefe remained friends long after they retired from baseball. He died at the age of 82 in Concord, New Hampshire. He had been staying with his grandson in Nashua when he had to be taken to a Concord hospital with congestive heart failure. He is interred in the Calvary Cemetery in Woodside, Queens, New York, under his birth name of Walsh. Welch was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1973. He was represented at the Hall of Fame induction ceremony by his elderly daughter, Julia Weiss. ==See also== *300 win club *List of Major League Baseball career wins leaders *List of Major League Baseball annual saves leaders *List of Major League Baseball career strikeout leaders ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * Category:1859 births Category:1941 deaths Category:19th- century baseball players Category:National Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Category:Burials at Calvary Cemetery (Queens, New York) Category:American people of Irish descent Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Baseball players from New York (state) Category:New York Giants (NL) players Category:New York Gothams players Category:Sportspeople from Brooklyn Category:Troy Trojans players Category:Pittsburgh Allegheny players Category:Holyoke (minor league baseball) players Category:Troy Trojans (minor league) players Category:People from Williamsburg, Brooklyn ","title":"Mickey Welch"},{"id":"845521","text":"GNU arch software is a distributed revision control system that is part of the GNU Project and licensed under the GNU General Public License. It is used to keep track of the changes made to a source tree and to help programmers combine and otherwise manipulate changes made by multiple people or at different times. As of 2009, GNU arch's official status is deprecation, and only security fixes are applied. Bazaar (or 'bzr') has since also been made an official GNU project and can thus be considered the replacement for GNU arch. It is not a fork of arch. == Features == Being a distributed, decentralized versioning system, each revision stored using arch is uniquely globally identifiable; such identifier can be used in a distributed setting to easily merge or \\"cherry-pick\\" changes from completely disparate sources. Being decentralized means that there is no need for a central server for which developers have to be authorized in order to contribute. As with other systems, a full read-only copy of a project is made accessible in an \\"official\\" repository via HTTP, FTP, or SFTP; but then, contributors are encouraged to make modifications and publish them in a public archive (repository) of their own, so that the head developer may manually merge changesets into the official repository. To simulate the behavior of centralized revision control systems, the head developer could allow shell access (SSH) or write access (FTP, SFTP, WebDAV) to a server, allowing authorized users to commit to a central server. More often, GNU arch-managed projects have a lead benevolent dictator that merges changes from contributors. GNU arch has several other features: ; Atomic commits : Commits are all-or-nothing. The tree must be in proper condition before the commit begins, and commits are not visible to the world until complete. If the commit is interrupted before this, it remains invisible and must be rolled back before the next commit. This avoids corruption of the archive and other users' checked-out copies. ; Changeset oriented : Instead of tracking individual files (as in CVS), GNU arch tracks changesets, which are akin to patches. Each changeset is a description of the difference between one source tree and another, and so a changeset can be used to produce one revision from another revision. Authors are encouraged to use one commit per feature or bugfix. ; Easy branching : Branching is efficient and can span archives. A branch (or 'tag') simply declares the ancestor revision, and development continues from there. ; Advanced merging : Due to the permanent record of all ancestors and merged revisions, merging can take into account which branch contains which patch, and can do three-way merging based on a shared ancestor revision. ; Cryptographic signatures : Every changeset is stored with a hash to prevent accidental corruption. Using an external file signing program (such as GnuPG or another PGP client), these hashes can also optionally be signed, preventing unauthorized modification if the archive is compromised. ; Renaming : All files and directories can be easily renamed. These are tracked by a unique ID rather than by name, so history is preserved, and patches to files are properly merged even if filenames differ across branches. ; Metadata tracking : The permissions of all files are tracked. Symbolic links are supported and are tracked the same way as files and directories. == History and maintainership == === GNU arch version 1 and tla === The original author and maintainer of GNU arch was Thomas Lord who started the project in 2001. The command used to manipulate GNU arch repositories is tla, an initialism for Tom Lord's Arch. Lord started GNU arch as a collection of shell scripts to provide an alternative to CVS. In 2003, arch became part of the GNU project. The GNU arch project forked several times, resulting in both Canonical Ltd.'s now abandoned Baz fork and Walter Landry's ArX project. Both forks provoked a hostile reaction: the ArX fork was due to a serious dispute in direction and Lord was strongly critical of Canonical's approach to announcing the Baz project. In August 2005 Lord announced that he was resigning as the maintainer of GNU arch and recommended that Baz become the main GNU arch project. However, this did not happen: the Baz fork was abandoned by Canonical in favour of the separate Bazaar project, with the 1.5 release of Baz being scrapped in 2006. In October, 2005, Andy Tai announced that Lord and the Free Software Foundation had accepted his offer to be the maintainer of GNU arch. Tai subsequently merged many features from Baz back into tla, but in March 2008 indicated that tla was no longer under active development and was no longer competitive with other version control systems. === revc === revc was a prototype revision control project by Thomas Lord that he intended to become GNU arch 2.0, designed to be a radical departure from tla and to draw many ideas from the Git revision control system. It was announced in June 2005, the first pre-release was in July and the last in August, just prior to Lord's resignation as maintainer. revc only had 10 core commands and Lord intended to eliminate restrictive namespaces, complicated file naming conventions and increase the speed. As of 2008 the last pre-release, 0.0x2, of revc is still available and Lord is still interested in some of the ideas in GNU arch but does not have the resources to resume development of revc. == Criticism == Perhaps the most common criticism of GNU arch is that it is difficult to learn, even for users who have experience with other SCM systems. In particular, GNU arch has a large number of commands, which can be intimidating for new users and some design elements arguably too strongly enforce Lord's taste in version control practices. Some also criticize GNU arch for using very unusual file naming conventions (), which can create difficulties for using it in scripts, some shells, and in porting it to non-Unix operating systems. GNU arch has been criticised for having a slow running time as part of a design decision to lessen internal code complexity. == See also == * Revision control * List of revision control software * Comparison of revision control software ==References== ==External links== * *LWN.net article on arch Category:Free version control software Category:Free software programmed in C Category:GNU Project software Category:Distributed version control systems Category:Discontinued version control systems Category:2001 software ","title":"GNU arch"},{"id":"845523","text":"Press conference ahead of the elections 2004 Hyderabad Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) is a communist party in India.

It is a form of disorderly conduct. ==Public order== ===England, Wales and Northern Ireland=== In England and Wales, theoretically all criminal offences cognizable by English law involve \\"a breach of the Queen's peace\\", and all indictments formerly concluded \\"against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her crown and dignity\\" before the passage of the Indictments Act 1915 and the Rules that formed that Act's first schedule. The conclusion has also found its way into constitutional law in many United States state constitutions, which mandate that indictments within the state end in a similar manner to the above, usually omitting the \\"crown\\" part or substituting \\"government\\". For example, New Jersey's is \\"against the peace of this State, the government and dignity of the same\\". Historically that concluding phrase, now legally superfluous, represents the last trace of the process by which the royal courts assume jurisdiction over all offences, and gradually eroded the jurisdiction of the sheriff and of lords of manor and franchises, making crime a matter of national concern as distinguished from civil wrongs or infractions of the rights of local magnates. The Peace of the King was sworn on his accession or full recognition, and the jurisdiction of his courts to punish all violations of that peace was gradually asserted. The completion of this process is marked by the institution of the office of Justice of the Peace. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, breach of the peace is descended from the Justices of the Peace Act 1361, which refers to riotous and barratous behaviour that disturbs the peace of the King. More modern authority defines a breach of the peace as \\"when a person reasonably believes harm will be caused, or is likely to be caused, to a person or in his presence to his property, or a person is in fear of being harmed through an assault, affray, riot, unlawful assembly, or some other form of disturbance\\".R. v. Howell [1982] QB 416 The breach of the peace power of arrest is provided by the common law and therefore an 'any person' power of arrest and entry both within the same definition.R v Howell 1982 (E/W case law) Section 17(5) of PACE 1984 abolished all powers of a Constable to enter under the common law with the specific exception (subsection 6) when dealing with or preventing a common law breach of the peace. This \\"offence\\" definition and power of arrest are contained under the common law definition of \\"breach of the peace\\". Breach of the peace powers are unusual in the fact they originate from the laws Alfred the Great consolidated into the common law approximately 1,000 years before the modern Constable was thought up. The first legislative reference to the common law breach of the peace was under the Justice of the Peace Act 1361. As a result, when a Constable uses their breach of the peace powers, they are acting as 'any person' and not fully as a sworn officer. In England and Wales, breach of the peace is a civil proceeding (rather than a criminal offence), although the case must be proved to the criminal standard of proof, 'beyond reasonable doubt', rather than the civil standard of proof, 'on the balance of probabilities'. Sometimes the Crown Prosecution Service conduct the case on behalf of the police, but the police service is liable for any costs awarded in favour or against the prosecutor. Breach of the Peace is not an offence, in the sense that it is not punishable either by a fine or imprisonment either at statute or common law and nor do proceedings for breach of the peace give rise to any conviction.R. v. County of London Quarter Sessions Appeals Committee, ex parte Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1948] 1 KB 670, per Lord Goddard, CJ; Williamson v. Chief Constable of West Midlands Police [2004] (1 WLR 14, per Dyson, LJ) In England and Wales, constables (or other persons) are permitted to arrest a person to \\"prevent a further breach of the peace\\" which allows for the police or the public to arrest a person before a breach of the peace has occurred. This is permitted when it is reasonable to believe should the person remain, that they would continue with their course of conduct and that a Breach of the Peace would occur. The only immediate sanction that can be imposed by a court for breach of the peace is to bind over the offender to keep the peace: that is, justices of the peace can require a person to enter into a recognizance to keep the peace. Any punishment (in the sense of a loss of freedom or permanent financial penalty) takes the form of loss of the surety if the defendant fails to keep the peace or be of good behaviour during the period for which he is bound over. The binding over itself does not amount to a conviction (but any following behaviour causing loss of the surety might well result in conviction for an associated offence). A failure to enter into a recognizance may of itself lead to a person being committed to custody under s.115(3) Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. ===Scotland=== There are major differences between English law and Scottish law with respect to dealing with breach of the peace; unlike England and Wales where criminal penalties apply to the behaviour leading to or liable to cause a breach of the peace, it is a specific criminal offence in Scotland which is prosecuted daily in the sheriff courts and due to its common law definition it can be applied to a number of scenarios. The maximum punishment if a case is remitted to the High Court remains imprisonment for life although such severe punishment is now rarely applied, usually being associated with breaches of licence during an existing life sentence. The Scottish law definition of a breach of the peace is \\"conduct severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people and threaten serious disturbance to the community\\".Smith v Donnelly 2002 J.C. 65 or 2001 S.L.T. 1007 or 2001 S.C.C.R. 800 (Confirmed with full bench decision in Jones v Carnegie 2004 S.L.T. 609 or 2004 S.C.C.R. 361) A constable may arrest any person, without warrant, who commits a breach of the peace. A member of the public may not arrest a person for behaviour which amounts to no more than a breach of the peace (i.e. an arrest is not always for the offence for which someone is eventually prosecuted but can be for a more serious crime that appears to be occurring). Breach of the peace can include, but is not limited to, any riotous behaviours (which includes \\"rowdiness\\" or \\"brawling\\") and any disorderly behaviour. This behaviour need not be noisy but still of a nature that would cause concern to other people. Examples include voyeurism, persistently following someone, delivering threatening letters and \\"streaking\\" or \\"mooning\\". To prove a breach of the peace, the most important things to prove are that someone was alarmed, annoyed or disturbed by the incident. The offence can take place anywhere, for example, a public street or any public space. One of the leading cases in Scots law is that of Smith v Donnelly, a case concerning a Faslane protester. ===United States=== In the United States, prosecutions for breach of the peace are subject to constitutional constraints. In Terminiello v. City of Chicago (1949), the United States Supreme Court held that an ordinance of the City of Chicago that banned speech which \\"stirs the public to anger, invites dispute, brings about a condition of unrest, or creates a disturbance\\" was unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.. Justice Douglas stated: \\"Accordingly a function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger. Speech is often provocative and challenging. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea.\\"Terminiello, 337 U.S. at 4. In Cox v. Louisiana (1965), the Supreme Court held that a Louisiana statute criminalizing breaches of the peace was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad because it would allow persons to be prosecuted for expressing unpopular views.. The statute read in part: > Whoever with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or under circumstances > such that a breach of the peace may be occasioned thereby ... crowds or > congregates with others ... in or upon ... a public street or public > highway, or upon a public sidewalk, or any other public place or building > ... and who fails or refuses to disperse and move on ... when ordered so to > do by any law enforcement officer of any municipality, or parish, in which > such act or acts are committed, or by any law enforcement officer of the > state of Louisiana, or any other authorized person ... shall be guilty of > disturbing the peace.Cox, 379 U.S. at 544 (quoting La. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 14:103.1 > (Cum. Supp. 1962)). On the state level, at least one court has reasoned that the essence of a breach of the peace was the potential to cause a disruption in tranquility or to promote the threat of violence, stating that a breach of the peace was that which \\"disturbs or threatens to disturb the tranquility enjoyed by the citizens\\". Woods v. State, 152 Tex. Crim. 338, 213 S.W.2d 685, 687 (1948) Head v. State, 131 Tex. Crim. 96, 96 S.W.2d 981, 982 (1936)). ==See also== * Common scold * Public nuisance * Queen's peace * Rule according to higher law * Common law offences ‚Äì England & Wales ==References== == External links == * R v Howell 1982 (E/W case law * CPS.gov.uk (self-defence / prevention of crime advice) * The Crown Prosecution Service Guidance for Breach of the Peace and Bind Over Orders (Applies to England & Wales) Category:Constitutional law Category:Criminal law Category:Crimes Category:Noise pollution ","title":"Breach of the peace"},{"id":"845541","text":"APFTU rally in HyderabadAndhra Pradesh Federation of Trade Unions (in Telugu: ‡∞Ü‡∞Ç‡∞ß‡±ç‡∞∞ ‡∞™‡±ç‡∞∞‡∞¶‡±Ü‡±ï‡∞∂‡±ç ‡∞ï‡∞æ‡∞∞‡±ç‡∞Æ‡∞ø‡∞ï ‡∞∏‡∞Ç‡∞ò‡∞æ‡∞≤ ‡∞∏‡∞Æ‡∞æ‡∞ñ‡±ç‡∞Ø), trade union organization in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, related to Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist).

PARIS21's main objective is \\"to achieve national and international development goals and to reduce poverty in low and middle income countries\\".About PARIS21  Paris 21 In pursuit of this, PARIS21 \\"facilitates statistical capacity development, advocates for the integration of reliable data in decision-making, and coordinates donor support to statistics\\". The PARIS21 Secretariat is hosted within the Statistics and Data Directorate of the OECD in Boulogne-Billancourt, France. ==History== The OECD Development Assistance Committee hosted a meeting of 100 statistical and policy officials from developing countries, international organisations, regional banks and bilateral donors on 18‚Äì19 November 1999 to discuss the challenges faced by policymakers due to outdated, insufficient statistics, and the challenges faced by statisticians due to limited resources and low priority status in government.History  Paris 21 As a result of this meeting, PARIS21 was established as a \\"global partnership of national, regional and international statisticians, analysts, policy-makers, development professionals and other users of statistics\\".https://paris21.org/sites/default/files/inline- files/PARIS21_governance_arrangements_Sep-2019.pdf The primary purpose of PARIS21 is to \\"promote, influence and facilitate statistical capacity development and the better use of statistics\\". In function, PARIS21 acts as a \\"forum and a network\\" for relevant stakeholders \\"interested in the production and use of statistics to support economic and social development and to promote better governance\\". Members of this partnership work to advocate for better statistics production and use in both \\"policy and technical domains\\", and push for more and better funding for data and statistics in development. ==Structure== The PARIS21 Secretariat, led by the PARIS21 Secretariat Executive Head, is responsible for coordinating Partnership activities and \\"implementing the day-to-day work programme of PARIS21 as approved by the Board and the Executive Committee\\". The Board consists of stakeholder representatives from developing countries, bilateral donors and international organisations. The Board meets once a year to review the PARIS21 Programme of Work and to facilitate dialogue on general issues relating to the development and use of statistics. Outside of Board meetings, Secretariat activities are guided and monitored by a small Executive Committee consisting of members selected by the Board. This committee has the ability to organise task teams and ad hoc projects in the Board's absence. PARIS21's governance agreements were most recently revised in December 2017. Only occurring twice since PARIS21's inception (a revision was also made in November 2006),https://paris21.org/sites/default/files/2465.pdf revisions to PARIS21's governance agreements are made to \\"reflect the evolution\\" of PARIS21's role based on feedback from the Board. ==Areas of work== ===National Strategies for the Development of Statistics (NSDS)=== PARIS21's work involves assisting low- and middle-income countries to design, implement, and evaluate National Strategies for the Development of Statistics (NSDS). NSDS provide an overall strategic vision of the development of a country's national statistical system (NSS) in line with the data priorities of national, regional and international development policies. NSDS serves as a comprehensive framework for the coordination of all data ecosystem stakeholders as well as for international and bilateral assistance. It addresses issues related to the data production, dissemination, access and use, in addition to modernisation of the NSS. ===Advocacy=== As a partnership, PARIS21's work involves connecting producers and users of statistics. It advocates for support to statistics at the international, regional and national levels. It produces a yearly Partner Report on Support to Statistics (PRESS), which documents the global status of technical and financial support to statistical development. At the country level, PARIS21 collaborates with individual national statistical systems to produce a Country Report on Support to Statistics (CRESS) examining the state of funding for statistics in the national statistical system. Additionally, PARIS21 organises in-country training sessions and workshops for national statistical offices, journalism and media professionals and others to develop skills in communicating statistics, data visualization and advocacy. ===Capacity development=== Statistical Capacity Development Outlook & Monitor In March 2019, PARIS21 published its Statistical Capacity Development Outlook report on \\"current trends, challenges and emerging approaches in statistical capacity development\\". An online, interactive \\"Statistical Capacity Monitor\\" platform was launched in coordination with the report, aiming to \\"play a role in guiding future efforts to develop capacity within and across national statistical systems and to support co-ordination efforts among donors\\". 13 As of January 2020, the PARIS21 Statistical Capacity Monitor features 109 indicators on statistical capacity and capacity development to \\"support countries, donors and service providers to tailor capacity development programmes in statistics\\". The Monitor provides access to an evolving set of indicators on statistical capacity intended to offer insight on where countries stand in different areas of capacity. It \\"facilitates country and regional comparisons across multiple dimensions of statistical capacity, presenting trends in key drivers (such as funding and legislation).‚Äù Capacity Development 4.0 According to its website, PARIS21 coined the term \\"Capacity Development 4.0\\" in 2016 to describe a new way of undertaking capacity development in national statistical systems. Capacity Development 4.0 is defined as: > \\"the process through which a country‚Äôs national statistical system, its > organisations and individuals, obtain, strengthen and maintain their > abilities to collect, produce, analyse and disseminate high-quality data to > meet user needs\\". This approach is intended to bring together new data stakeholders, better involves users and to promote a holistic view of statistical capacity development. It is meant to go beyond technical skills, and emphasises \\"softer\\" skills such as leadership, change management, advocacy and networking. In January 2020, PARIS21 published its Guidelines for Developing Statistical Capacity: A Roadmap for Capacity Development 4.0. ===Innovation=== Advanced Data Planning Tool PARIS21 launched its Advanced Data Planning Tool (ADAPT) in 2017 as a free cloud-based tool for national statistical offices and \\"other data producers to adapt their data production to the priority data needs from policy makers\\". ADAPT was designed for data demand and supply analysis, developing of NSDS and other data plans and to monitor data plan activities, including costing and budgeting. The tool itself can be customised to accommodate country-specific needs, and it offers support in multiple languages. While ADAPT is an online tool, it is also used in face-to-face field workshops organised worldwide by PARIS21 and partners to train national statistical offices on data planning. In 2019, PARIS21 introduced a gender- specific module to ADAPT. Citizen Generated Data PARIS21 works with national statistical offices to support the use of citizen-generated data (CGD) in official reporting. PARIS21's support addresses areas of country-level advocacy, coordination and collaboration mechanisms and capacity development. PARIS21 also works to develop quality assurance frameworks for CGD validation and integration. PARIS21 Academy In January 2020, PARIS21 launched an e-learning platform called PARIS21 Academy which is open to anyone, but \\"primarily serves staff from official statistical agencies and data users like journalists\\". The platform hosts multimedia content including e-learning modules on topics such as data planning, gender statistics, data communication, financing data for development, trust in data and statistics, and statistical capacity development. ===Supporting gender statistics=== PARIS21 collaborates with UN Women since 2018 under the latter's flagship programme \\"Women Count\\" to support gender statistics at the global, regional and national level. As part of this collaboration, PARIS21 ‚Äì in cooperation with national and international experts in gender statistics ‚Äì developed a Gender Statistics Assessment Framework to help countries evaluate the state of gender statistics in terms of data and capacity gaps. The assessment is meant to provide input on mainstreaming the gender perspective in national strategies for the development of statistics, a process which is currently underway in Cambodia and El Salvador (as of January 2020). PARIS21's assessment process has also been piloted in the Dominican Republic, Egypt, the Kyrgyz Republic, Maldives and Senegal. The integration of gender statistics in the national statistical strategies is intended to secure political interest and funding which can enhance production and dissemination. PARIS21 is also working to improve data dissemination and communication of gender statistics through media engagement and data visualization trainings. An e-learning module on communicating gender statistics for journalists and producers of statistics is being developed for the PARIS21 Academy. PARIS21 is also reporting on developing partners' support to gender statistics through a special module in its PRESS report. The gender module of the PRESS survey provides valuable information on bilateral and multilateral donor support to projects targeting gender statistics. ===Role in international activities=== Bern Network on Financing Data for Development The Bern Network on Financing Data for Development formed in 2019 and is described by PARIS21 as an \\"open, multi-stakeholder alliance to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by promoting more and better financing for data\\". The Bern Network is focused on low-income countries and fragile states, working to \\"support better identification of needs, improved investment proposals, better co- ordination at the country level, and bridge domestic and external financial and technical support for low-capacity countries\\". In December 2019, the Bern Network released a paper on its five action areas to improve the quality and quantity of funding for development data, building on an earlier report published in July 2019. Network members are currently working to develop concrete commitments on more and better funding for data to be launched at the United Nations World Data Forum on Sustainable Development Data 2020 in Bern, Switzerland. Cross Regional Engagement / Cross Regional Fora PARIS21's annual Cross Regional Fora began in 2015 as a platform of engagement and exchange to bring together multiple stakeholders from the national, regional and global levels to discuss good practices, experiences and challenges surrounding various themes in statistics. The fora also serve as a venue to advance recommendations for improving current statistical practices, while also contributing to knowledge creation and sharing. The most recent Cross Regional Forum in 2019 centred on trust in data and official statistics. Participants represented national statistical offices, international organisations, civil society and academia. The 2019 Forum also launched the PARIS21 2020 Trust Initiative, a project funding opportunity for proposals of how to \\"enhance trust\\" in data at the country level. ==See also== *List of national and international statistical services *United Nations Statistics Division *United Nations Statistical Commission *Committee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities (CCSA) == References == ==External links== *PARIS21 *OECD Statistics and Data Directorate Category:Statistical organizations Category:United Nations Economic and Social Council ","title":"PARIS21"},{"id":"845588","text":"W√§in√∂ Valdemar Aaltonen (8 March 1894 ‚Äì 30 May 1966) was a Finnish artist and sculptor. The Chambers Biographical Dictionary describes him as \\"one of the leading Finnish sculptors\\".Chambers Biographical Dictionary, , page 1 He was born to a tailor in the village of Karinainen, Finland. He became interested in art after being deaf as a child, and attended the School of Drawing of the Turku Art Association from age 16, or specifically between 1910 and 1915.Schildt, G√∂ran, Modern Finnish Sculpture. Praeger Publishers, New York, 1970 He had spent many of the early years at this school studying painting, but he was mainly self-taught as a sculptor. He learned the technics of treatment of marble with his relative Aarre Aaltonen, and by working as a trainee stonemason in Hirvensalo. Sculptor Felix Nylund was a substitute teacher in the art school in Turku for one season, and his work was inspiration for young Aaltonen. A journey Aaltonen made to Italy in 1923 opened his eyes to cubist and futurist art. These elements can primarily be seen in his paintings. As the Republic of Finland arose, and the First World War raged, he sculpted War Memorials. He soon became a nationalist icon, the exemplar Finn, establishing an exhibition in Stockholm in 1927. His sculpture is nationalist in nature, and he is noted for monumental figures and busts portraying citizens of Finland. An example is the 1925 sculpture of Paavo Nurmi, a cast of which is exhibited outside the Helsinki stadium. Another notable work is that of Jean Sibelius, a bust of 1928. These two works, like the main body of his work, are bronze casts‚Äîthough he did work in stone and even glass. Though chiefly naturalistic, the cubist influence is also present here. He was one of the early 20th-century pioneers of direct carving. When the new House of Parliament for Finland was built, architect Johan Sigfrid Sir√©n wished he could buy sculptures directly from Aaltonen. Instead, an open competition was announced, and Aaltonen's Work and the Future was selected as the winner. The series of gilded plaster sculptures that Aaltonen completed in 1932 were cast in bronze after his death. Aaltonen was married four times. His first wife was singer Aino Alisa Pietik√§inen from 1920, second wife actor Elsa Emilia Rantalainen from 1931, third wife gallerist in Galerie Artek Elvi Elisabet Hernell from 1942 and fourth wife medical doctor Marie Elisabeth Maasik from year 1961.

Written by lyricist Yip Harburg and composer Jay Gorney, \\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\\" was part of the 1932 musical revue Americana; the melody is based on a Russian-Jewish lullaby. The song tells the story of the universal everyman, whose honest work towards achieving the American dream has been foiled by the economic collapse. Unusually for a Broadway song, it was composed largely in a minor key, as befits the subject matter. The song became best known through recordings by Bing Crosby and Rudy Vall√©e that were released in late 1932. The song received positive reviews and was one of the most popular songs of 1932. As one of the few popular songs during the era to discuss the darker aspects of the collapse, it came to be viewed as an anthem of the Great Depression. ==Background== Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen in Chicago, 1931. The Great Depression in the United States, which started with the 1929 Wall Street crash, had a severe impact on the country. In 1932, 25 percent of American men were unemployed. After his appliance business went bankrupt, Yip Harburg had gone into the music business, working as a lyricist. The melody derives from a Jewish lullaby that the composer Jay Gorney, who emigrated to the United States in 1906, heard in his native Russia. Initially it had other lyrics which discussed a romantic breakup. Gorney recalled that the pair came up with the title \\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\\" after walking in the Central Park where they heard unemployed men asking \\"Can you spare a dime?\\" Harburg recalled that he was working on a song for the musical Americana: \\"We had to have a title... Not to say, my wife is sick, I've got six children, the Crash put me out of business, hand me a dime. I hate songs of that kind.\\" Harburg's worksheets show that he went through several drafts of the lyrics, which included a satirical version attacking John D. Rockefeller and other tycoons. However, over time Harburg moved towards more concrete imagery, resulting in the final version. Both Gorney and Harburg were socialists. ==Composition and lyrical interpretation== The song is about a man who has sought the American dream, but was foiled by the Great Depression. He is the universal everyman who holds various professions, being a farmer and a construction worker as well as a veteran of World War I: it is intended to embrace all listeners. The man is someone \\"who kept faith in America, and now America has betrayed him\\". After three years of the Depression, the man has lost his job and is reduced to begging for charity. He recognizes the man whose dime () he is asking for. The lyrics refer to \\"Yankee Doodle Dum\\", a reference to patriotism, and the evocation of veterans also recalls the mid-1932 Bonus Army protests about military bonuses payable only after 21 years. Harburg said in an interview: \\"the man is really saying: I made an investment in this country. Where the hell are my dividends? ... [The song] doesn't reduce him to a beggar. It makes him a dignified human being, asking questions‚Äîand a bit outraged, too, as he should be.\\" This reflects the socialist or Marxist idea that workers deserve to enjoy the fruits of their labor, rather than have it be diverted by others. \\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\\" has an unusual structure for a Broadway song. First, rather than starting in a major key, as most Broadway songs do, it begins in a minor key, which is darker and more appropriate for the Depression. When discussing the prosperous past, the melody jumps an octave on the words \\"building a dream\\", emphasizing the dream, and moves briefly into a major key, evoking energy and optimism. This is placed in baffling and poignant contrast with the reality (\\"standing in line, / Just waiting for bread\\"). The song then reverts to the augmented dominant of the minor key in the word \\"time\\" in the line \\"Once I built a railroad, made it run / Made it race against time,\\" marking the end of prosperous times, and changing to a wistful mood. Each of the three main stanzas end in a direct appeal to the listener, \\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\\" The bridge deals with the singer's experiences as a veteran of the Great War, falling from patriotism \\"looked swell\\" to the discordant harmonies of \\"slogging through hell\\". The song then ends, not on a note of resignation, but with anger ‚Äì repeating the beginning (as is usual for Broadway songs), an octave higher, but with a significant change: the friendly \\"Brother, can you spare a dime?\\" is replaced with the more assertive \\"Buddy, can you spare a dime?\\" According to Harold Meyerson and Ernest Harburg, \\"[r]hythmically and melodically it sounds like a Jewish chant.\\" An article in Tablet Magazine suggested that the melody was similar to Hatikvah, the Israeli national anthem. ==Musical and cover versions== The song was first performed by the vaudeville singer Rex Weber as part of the musical Americana, which ran from October to December 1932 and was not a success. Three weeks after Americana opened, the song was covered by the up-and-coming crooner Bing Crosby for Brunswick Records; it was also covered by Rudy Vallee shortly thereafter for Columbia Records. Unusually, Vallee's version includes a spoken introduction, in which the narrator states that the song is \\"a bit out of character\\" for him. The song became popular through these versions, which were both frequently aired on the radio and competed for listeners. By the end of the year, Al Jolson had also covered the song on his popular show for NBC. The song has been covered by at least 52 artists in the United States including Judy Collins and Tom Waits. ==Reception and legacy== At the time, reviews of musicals rarely devoted much space to the songs' lyrics and melody. That was not true of the reviews of Americana. In The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson wrote that \\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\\" was \\"plaintive and thundering\\" and \\"the first song of the year that can be sung... Mr. Gorney has expressed the spirit of these times with more heart-breaking anguish than any of the prose bards of the day.\\" Gilbert Gabriel in New York American wrote: \\"Gorney and Harburg have written something so stirring that it will run away with the whole show\\". Theater Arts Monthlys review stated that the song \\"deflates the rolling bombast of our political nightmare with greater effect than all the rest of Mr. McEvoy's satirical skits put together\\"; Variety said that \\"Brother\\" was the only part of the show worth praising. Harburg later wrote that the song earned him several thousand dollars and helped him get started in the music business. Business leaders tried to have it banned from the radio, viewing the song as \\"a dangerous attack on the American economic system\\". They were unsuccessful due to the song's popularity. William Zinsser writes that \\"[t]he song so lacerated the national conscience that radio stations banned it\\" for being \\"sympathetic to the unemployed\\". Few thematic Depression songs were popular, because Americans did not want music which reminded them of the economic situation, but \\"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\\" was \\"the exception that proved the rule\\". Unlike other popular songs of the same era which tended to be upbeat, with titles such as \\"Happy Days Are Here Again\\" (1929), \\"On the Sunny Side of the Street\\" (1930), and \\"Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries\\" (1931), \\"Brother\\" \\"put words and music to what many Americans were feeling‚Äîfear, grief, even anger\\". The song was one of the first musical works to take the Depression seriously. It was one of the most popular twenty songs of 1932 in the United States. Philip Furia and Michael Lasser wrote that the song \\"embodied the Depression for millions of Americans... No other popular song caught the spirit of its time with such urgency.\\" In 2007, Clyde Haberman wrote that the song \\"endures as an anthem for the downtrodden and the forgotten\\". In 2011, Zinsser wrote that \\"Brother\\" \\"still hovers in the national memory; I can hear its ghostly echo in the chants of the Occupy Wall Street marchers\\". In a 2008 retrospective, NPR described it as \\"the anthem of the Great Depression\\". According to Meyerson and Ernest Harburg, the challenge that Yip Harburg faced in crafting the lyrics was \\"much like the challenge confronting the street-corner panhandler: to establish the character's individuality and the moral and political basis for his claim\\". They write that the latter achieved this by gradually building intimacy with the listener, starting in third person and moving into first, second, and then both first and second combined (\\"I'm your pal\\"). The internal rhymes help the listener remember that the singer was working towards a dream, which is now shattered. They also write that the song is a \\"masterpiece of economy\\" in building towards a \\"climactic assertion of commonality and interdependency\\" in \\"I'm your pal\\". \\"The music and lyrics together make us feel the quiet desperation of the singer.\\" Pianist Rob Kapilow remarked that the title is \\"the entire history of the Depression in a single phrase\\" and the listener ends up \\"feeling the time-immemorial complaint that the working man doesn't get the rewards\\". He says that Harburg and Gorney were brave to express this message in 1932 \\"when no one was saying this out loud\\". Furia and Lasser write that the song is unusual in relying on a strong narrative instead of emotion or imagery. Thomas S. Hischak wrote that the song was \\"one of the first theatre songs to have a potent sociological message, and it remains one of the most powerful of the genre\\". The song was the most prominent cultural representation of the Bonus Army. ==Parody== During the 1970s stagflation and in light of the Watergate scandal, Harburg wrote a parody version for The New York Times: ==References== ==External links== *Autographed score (1932) published by Paramount-Publix Category:1931 songs Category:Great Depression songs Category:Music controversies Category:Songs about the United States Category:Songs from musicals Category:Songs with lyrics by Yip Harburg Category:Songs with music by Jay Gorney Category:Bing Crosby songs Category:Traditional pop songs Category:United States National Recording Registry recordings ","title":"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?"},{"id":"845599","text":"Wonder Boys is a 1995 novel by the American writer Michael Chabon. It was adapted into a film with the same title in 2000. ==Plot summary== Pittsburgh professor and author Grady Tripp is working on an unwieldy 2,611-page manuscript that is meant to be the follow-up to his successful, award-winning novel The Land Downstairs, which was published seven years earlier. On the eve of a college-sponsored writers' and publishers' weekend called WordFest, Tripp's wife walks out on him, and he learns that his mistress, the chancellor of the college, Sara Gaskell, is pregnant with his child. To top it all off, Tripp finds himself involved in a bizarre crime committed by one of his students, an alienated young writer named James Leer. During a party, Leer shoots and kills the chancellor‚Äôs dog and steals her husband‚Äôs prized Marilyn Monroe collectible: the jacket worn by the actress on the day of her marriage to Joe DiMaggio. The New York Times reviewed the novel as \\"...the ultimate writing-program novel. If that sounds insulting, I don't mean it to be. But anyone who has ever served time in a writing program and gone to the \\"writing festivals\\" at various universities will instantly recognize the milieu and the characters.\\" ==Inspiration== The novel grew from Chabon‚Äôs concerns with completing an unrealized novel, Fountain City, about the construction of a perfect baseball park in Florida. He decided to write a story about, in part, an author who couldn‚Äôt finish his own work. The main character of Grady Tripp is admittedly based on University of Pittsburgh professor, Chuck Kinder, who taught the undergraduate Chabon in the early 1980s. Kinder‚Äôs great opus, a novel inspired by his friendship with author Raymond Carver, was reportedly more than 3000 pages long at one point. It was finally published in a very slimmed-down version in 2001 as Honeymooners: A Cautionary Tale. ==References== ==External links== * San Francisco Chronicle article Category:1995 American novels Category:Novels by Michael Chabon Category:American novels adapted into films Category:Novels about writers Category:Novels set in Pittsburgh Category:Villard (imprint) books Category:Novels about teachers ","title":"Wonder Boys"},{"id":"845608","text":"Kirsten Fiona Imrie (born 26 October 1967 at St Mary Abbots Hospital, Kensington, London) is a former Page 3 girl, glamour model, and television presenter. ==Career== Born in west London, Imrie was raised in Musselburgh, East Lothian, Scotland from the age of three.

In reality Cnicht is a long ridge and, at 689 m, is the fifth-highest peak in the Moelwynion mountain range. It can be easily ascended from Croesor, the village at its foot, or, with more difficulty, from Nant Gwynant to the north-west. Although rightly regarded by most people as a mountain in its own right, there are compilers of lists who consider that it does not in fact have enough prominence to separate it from its parent Allt-fawr in spite of over 110m of re-ascent and a distance of more than 4 km. Hence it is not regarded as a Marilyn. == Toponymy == The mountain gets its name from the old English word 'knight', the silent 'k' being pronounced at that time. It is said that the shape of the mountain bears a similarity to a knight's helmet. == In fiction == It appears as the \\"Saeth\\" in Patrick O'Brian's 1952 novel Three Bear Witness (published as Testimonies in the USA), which is set in a fictionalised version of Cwm Croesor.

She is notable for her use of textiles as a sculptural medium and her outdoor installations. She is widely regarded as one of Poland's most internationally acclaimed artists. She was a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland, from 1965 to 1990 and a visiting professor at University of California, Los Angeles in 1984. ==Early life== Magdalena Abakanowicz was born to a noble landowner family in Falenty. Her mother descended from old Polish nobility. Her father came from a Polonized Tatar family, which traced its origins to Abaqa Khan (a 13th-century Mongol chieftain). Her father's family fled Russia to the newly independent Poland after the October Revolution.Inglot, p. 12. The Russian invasion of 1920 forced her family to flee their home, after which they moved to the city of Gda≈Ñsk. When she was nine Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Poland. Her family endured the war years living on the outskirts of Warsaw and became part of the resistance. At the age of 14 she became a nurse's aid in a Warsaw hospital, seeing the impact of war first hand would later influence her art. After the war and resulting Soviet occupation, the family moved to the small city of Tczew near Gda≈Ñsk, in northern Poland, where they hoped to start a new life. Under Soviet control, the Polish government officially adopted Socialist realism as the only acceptable art form which should be pursued by artists. Originally conceived by Joseph Stalin in the 1930s, Socialist realism, in nature, had to be 'national in form' and 'socialist in content'.Inglot, p. 31. Other art forms being practiced at the time in the West, such as Modernism, were officially outlawed and heavily censored in all Eastern bloc nations, including Poland. Lack of official sanction did nothing to reduce her enthusiasm or alter the revolutionary course of her work. == Education == Abakanowicz completed part of her high school education in Tczew from 1945 to 1947, after which she went to Gdynia for two additional years of art school at the Liceum Sztuk Plastycznych in that city. After her graduation from the Liceum in 1949, Abakanowicz attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Sopot (now in Gda≈Ñsk).Grimes, William (April 21, 2017). \\"Magdalena Abakanowicz, Sculptor of Brooding Forms, Dies at 86\\". New York Times. Retrieved 2017-08-13. In 1950, Abakanowicz moved back to Warsaw to begin her studies at the Academy of Fine Arts there, the leading art school in Poland.Inglot, p. 28\\\\. Inglot characterizes the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts as \\"the most important training center for young artists\\" in Poland at that time. To get into the Academy she had to pretend to be the daughter of a clerk, because her noble background would otherwise have prevented her acceptance on the course. Her years at the university, 1950‚Äì1954, coincided with some of the harshest assaults made on art by the Soviet leadership. By utilizing the doctrine of 'Socialist realism', all art forms in Soviet occupied nations were forced to adhere to strict guidelines and limitations that subordinated the arts to the needs and demands of the State. Realist artistic depictions based on the national 19th-century academic tradition were the only form of artistic expression taught in Poland at the time.Inglot, p. 32. The Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts, being the most important artistic institution in Poland, came under special scrutiny from the Ministry of Art and Culture, which administered all major decisions in the field at the time.Inglot, p. 27. Abakanowicz found the climate at the Academy to be highly \\"rigid\\" and overly \\"conservative\\". She recalled: While studying at the University she was required to take several textile design classes, learning the art of weaving, screen printing, and fiber design from instructors such as Anna Sledziewska, Eleonora Plutymska, and Maria Urbanowicz. These instructors and skills would greatly influence Abakanowicz's work, as well as that of other prominent Polish artists of the time.Inglot, p. 28. ==First artworks== Cytadela park, Pozna≈Ñ, Poland (whole installation) Following her education at the Academy, Abakanowicz began to produce her first artistic works. Due to the fact that she spent most of her academic life moving from place to place, much of her earlier artwork was lost or damaged, with only a few, delicate plant drawings surviving. Between 1956 and 1959, she produced some of her earliest known works; a series of large gouaches and watercolors on paper and sewn-together linen sheets. These works, described as being 'biomorphic\\" in composition, depicted imaginary plants, birds, exotic fish, and seashells, among other biomorphic shapes and forms. Joanna Inglot wrote in The Figurative Sculpture of Magdalena Abakanowicz about these early works: \\"[they] pointed to Abakanowicz's early fascination with the natural world and its processes of germination, growth, blooming, and sprouting. They seem to capture the very energy of life, a quality that would become a constant feature of her art.\\" Abakanowicz said: It was also during this time that Poland began to lift some of the heavy political pressures imposed by the Soviet Union, mainly due to the death of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1953. In 1956, under the new party leadership of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka, Poland experienced a dramatic social and cultural shift. The shift resulted in the liberalization of the forms and content of art, with the Stalinistic methods of art form being openly criticized by the Gomulka government. A major freedom granted to Polish artists was the permission to travel to several Western cities, such as Paris, Venice, Munich, and New York City, to experience artistic developments outside the Eastern bloc. This liberalization of the arts in Poland and injection of other art forms into the Polish art world greatly influenced Abakanowicz's early works, as she began to consider much of her early work as being \\" too flamboyant and lacking in structure.\\" Constructivism began to influence her work in the late 1950s as she adopted a more geometric and structured approach. Never fully accepting Constructivism, she searched for her own \\"artistic language and for a way to make her art more tactile, intuitive, and personal.\\"Inglot, p. 39. As a result, she soon adopted weaving as another avenue of artistic exploration. In her first one-person exhibit at the Kordegarda Gallery in Warsaw in the spring of 1960, she included a series of four weavings along with a collection of gouaches and watercolors. Though her first exhibit received minimal critical notice, it helped advance her position within the Polish textile and fiber design movement and resulted in her inclusion into the first Biennale Internationale de le Tapisserie in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1962. The event opened the way to her international success. ==Series== alt= Space of Unknown Growth (Europos Parkas, Lithuania) === Abakans === The 1960s saw some of the most important works produced during Abakanowicz's career. In 1967, she began producing three-dimensional fiber works called Abakans. Her Abakans were included in a group exhibition titled, Wall Hangings, organised in 1969 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York by Mildred Constantine, curator of architecture and design, and the textile designer Jack Lenor Larsen. Abakanowicz and the other artists included in the exhibition were pushing boundaries between high art and traditional definitions of what was considered craft. Her use of \\"unexpected, often soft materials, arranged in modular or serial structures‚Äù in her Abakan series, places her within the Postminimalism art movement that began in 1966. Abakanowicz stated that she sought the ‚Äútotal obliteration of the utilitarian function of tapestry‚Äù and demonstrated the capacity of fiber to produce forms that were soft yet structured and complex. Each Abakan is made out of woven material using Abakanowicz's own technique. The material used for many of these pieces was found, often collecting sisal ropes from harbors, intertwining them into threads and dying them.Brenson, Michael, Magdalena Abakanowicz's Abakans, Art Journal. Volume 54. Issue: 1, 1995 She also used \\"rope, hemp, flax, wool and horsehair.\\" Hung from the ceiling, Abakans reach sizes as large as thirteen feet with sometimes only a few inch clearance from the ground. The Abakans often incorporated reproductive references to eggs and the womb. One of her large Abakans is included in the collection of the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas, Texas. The piece hangs on the wall and is made of five large recycled sisal panels in varying thickness and dyed in a burnt umber color. The work was acquired in 2019 and was exhibited in an exhibition titled Resist/Release. In 2019, her work featuring Abakans entitled Caminando, from the private collection of Robin Williams, set a new record at auction for an artwork sold in Poland by fetching 8 million zloty (ca. $2.1 million). ===Humanoid sculptures=== During the 1970s, and into the 1980s, Abakanowicz changed medium and scale; she began a series of figurative and non-figurative sculptures made out of pieces of coarse sackcloth which she sewed and pieced together and bonded with synthetic resins. These works became more representational than previous sculptures but still retain a degree of abstraction and ambiguity. In 1974-1975 she produced sculptures called Alterations, which were twelve hollowed-out headless human figures sitting in a row. From 1973‚Äì1975 she produced a series of enormous, solid forms reminiscent of human heads without faces called Heads. From 1976-1980 she produced a piece call Backs, which was a series of eighty slightly differing sculptures of the human trunk. In 1986-87 she created a series of fifty standing figures called The Crowd I. She also began to once again work around organic structures, such as her Embryology series, which consisted of several dozen soft egg-like lumps varying in size. These were dispersed round an exhibition room at the Vienna Biennial in 1980. These humanoid works of the 1970s and 1980s were centered around human culture and nature as a whole and its condition and position in modern society. The multiplicity of the human forms represents confusion and anonymity, analyzing an individual's presence in a mass of humanity.Kitowska-Lysiak, Malgorzata, Magdalena Abakanowicz , Visual Arts Profile, Polish Culture, Art History Institute of the Catholic University of Lublin, 2004 These works have close connections to Abakanowicz's life living in a Communist regime which repressed individual creativity and intellect in favor of the collective interest. These works also contrast with her earlier Abakan series, which were individually powerful pieces, whereas the figurative sculptures lost their individuality in favor of multiplicity. In the late 1980s to 1990s Abakanowicz began to use metals, such as bronze, for her sculptures, as well as wood, stone, and clay. Her works from this period include Bronze Crowd (1990‚Äì91), shown in the garden of the Nasher Sculpture Center, and Puellae (1992), part of the National Gallery of Art's collection. She stated in a speech given at the Academy of Fine Arts in ≈Å√≥d≈∫: The Metropolitan Museum of Art to Landmarks, the public art program of The University of Texas at Austin, where it is on display in the Bass Concert Hall Plaza.alt= Her 2000 humanoid bronze sculpture Figure on a Trunk, originally displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is currently on loan to Landmarks, the public art program of The University of Texas at Austin. ===War Games=== One of Abakanowicz's most unusual works is titled War Games, which is a cycle of monumental structures made up of huge trunks of old trees, with their branches and bark removed. Partly bandaged with rags and hugged by steel hoops, these sculptures are placed on lattice metal stands. Like the name of the cycle implies, these sculptures have a very militaristic feel to them, as they have been compared to artillery vehicles. During the 1990s Abakanowicz was also commissioned to design a model of an ecologically- oriented city. She also choreographed dance. ===Agora=== Abakanowicz's final round of work includes a project called Agora, which is a permanent installation located at the southern end of Chicago's Grant Park, next to the Roosevelt Road Metra station. It consists of 106 cast iron figures, each about nine feet tall. All the figures are similar in shape, but different in details. The artist and her three assistants created models for each figure by hand, and the casting took place from 2004 to 2006. The surface of each figure resembles a tree bark or wrinkled skin. The work creates a feeling of crowdedness, hence the name \\"agora\\". Furthermore, all the bodies end at the torso, giving them an eerie, anonymous look. Agora by Magdalena Abakanowicz, in the south end of Grant Park, Chicago, Illinois, at the intersection of Michigan Avenue and East Roosevelt Road. The entire installation is about long. ==Awards== * Grand Prix of S√£o Paulo Biennale, S√£o Paulo, Brazil (1965) * Herder Prize, Vienna, Austria (1979) * Jurzykowski Prize, New York City (1982) * Award for Distinction in Sculpture, granted by the Sculpture Center, New York (1993) * Commander Cross with Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta (1998) * Officier de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, Paris, France (1999) * Leonardo da Vinci World Award of Arts, Norway (1999) * Knight of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (2000) * Visionaries!

The name Rhinogydd derives from the names of two of the more famous peaks, Rhinog Fawr and Rhinog Fach, although the greatest elevation in the range is reached by Y Llethr, 756 m (2,480 feet). Foel Penolau, the northernmost summit of the range, was promoted to a Hewitt in 2018 due to a new survey. Rhinog Fach and Y Llethr from the slopes of Rhinog Fawr The Rhinogydd are notably rocky and heather-clad towards the northern end of the range, especially around Rhinog Fawr, Rhinog Fach and towards Moel Ysgyfarnogod. The southern end, around Y Llethr, Diffwys and the Ysgethin Valley has a softer, grassy character. A population of feral goats are in the range. Over 30 km¬≤ are protected as a Special Area of Conservation and a National Nature Reserve. ==Geology== The Rhinogydd are formed of hard sedimentary rocks of Cambrian age which occur as a major anticlinal structure known to geologists as the Harlech Dome. This structure which originated during the Caledonian Orogeny (mountain-building period) extends from Cadair Idris in the south to Blaenau Ffestiniog in the north. Its erosion by successive ice ages has left the valleys and peaks of the Rhinogydd visible today.Snowdonia National Park - The geology of Snowdonia Retrieved 5 January 2012 The core of the area is formed from the hard-wearing greywackes of the Rhinog Formation. The formation also contains and is overlain by some siltstones and mudstones which form a broken zone of softer scenery around the periphery of the area's rugged core. In places, swarms of dolerite dykes cut through the country rocks in a generally northwest-southeast direction. Much of the lower ground is mantled by glacial till, a legacy of the last ice age.British Geological Survey 1:50,000 scale geological map sheet 135/149 Harlech ===History of geological investigations=== The geology of the area was first characterised by Adam Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison in 1835.Sedgwick, A. and Murchison, R.I. 'On the Silurian and Cambrian systems, exhibiting the order in which the older sedimentary strata succeed each other in England and Wales' Rep. Br. Assoc. Adv. Sci.

At least a dozen major publications appeared between 1844 and 1939. ==Hillwalking in the Rhinogydd== The Rhinogydd are far less well known than the areas in the north of the Snowdonia National Park, such as the Glyderau, Carneddau and the Snowdon massif itself. This is due to the rugged nature of the landscape in the Rhinogydd and the fame of Snowdon as the highest peak in Wales. The Rhinog mountains are popular with hillwalkers looking for a more isolated, wilder walking experience. The peaks of the range are most easily accessed from the west side. Two valleys - Cwm Nantcol ('valley of the Nantcol (stream)') and Cwm Bychan ('small valley') - lead deep into the mountains and may be reached from the village of Llanbedr. The most popular walking route in this area begins at the Roman Steps at , which leads from Cwm Bychan through Bwlch Tyddiad and around Rhinog Fawr. Despite the name, these steps are not Roman and are in fact the well preserved remains of a medieval packhorse trail leading from Chester to Harlech Castle. At the top of the Roman Steps, the route curves around the eastern end of Rhinog Fawr and enters Cwm Nantcol via Bwlch Drws Ardudwy (The Pass of the Doorway of Ardudwy). A different path leads from Cwm Nantcol, passing around the western end of Rhinog Fawr back to Cwm Bychan via Gloywlyn ('gleaming lake'), completing a circular route that can easily be completed in a day. ==Main peaks== Y Garn with the River Mawddach estuary at far left and Diffwys, Crib y Rhiw, Y Llethr, Rhinog Fach and Rhinog Fawr from left to right The range contains the following Marilyns: *Y Llethr 756 m *Rhinog Fawr 720 m *Y Garn 629 m *Moel Ysgyfarnogod 623 m *Moelfre 589 m the following Hewitts: *Rhinog Fach 712 m *Diffwys 750 m *Foel Penolau 614 m and the following Nuttalls: *Crib-y-rhiw 670 m *Diffwys West Top 642 m ==References== ==External links== *Time Out - Wales.

It is bounded by the Gulf of Kutch in the northwest and by the Gulf of Khambhat (Gulf of Cambay) in the east. In the northeast, it is connected to mainland Gujarat. It is crossed by two belts of hill country and nine leading streams. Kathiawar ports were flourishing centres of trade and commerce since at least the 16th century. == Etymology and history == Kathiawar 1855 with its four prant districts: Halar, Jhalavad, Sorath and Gohilwad. Arrow Pillar or Baan- Stambh at Somnath The word Kathiawad means the land of the Kathis, a Rajput tribe who migrated to the region in the 8th century and controlled the southwestern peninsula of contemporary Gujarat. ==History== Kathis were widespread in the region and dominated central Saurashtra in particular for some centuries. Although the Kathis are believed to have migrated to the area as late as the 16th century, they have played an important part in the documented history of the region. During the reign of Pratihar ruler Mihir Bhoj, the Gurjar empire stretched from Kathiawad to the Bay of Bengal. A Haddola inscription confirms that Gurjar Pratihars continued to rule in this region during the reign of Mahipala I too. The peninsula is dotted with antiquities and has a continuous history from prehistoric times to the early periods of the Mahabharata through the Indus civilization. It was influenced by Kathi people in particular between the 16th century to the mid 20th century and therefore the emergent name of Kathiawar became a favourite alternative to the region of Saurashtra. In a geopolitical context, the area of Kathiawar forms the core of Saurashtra. In feudal times, there were certain principle divisions of Saurashtra falling under princely states, namely Rajkot State, Jamnagar State, Gondal State, Bhavnagar State, Dhrangadhra State, Morvi State, Jasdan State, Jetpur State, Vankaner State. However, the main area of Kathiawar covered 10 districts: Rajkot, Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, Surendranagar, Porbandar, Amreli, Junagadh, Botad, Morvi, Gir-somnath. For a long period, the name Sorath remained limited to the region when the Chudasama Rajput (Raa' dynasty) ruled from 875 to 1473. Concurrently, major Rajput clans that held a sway over this region included the Walas (Kathis), Jethwas, Raijadas, Chudasamas, Gohils, Jhalas, Jadejas, Chavdas, Parmars, Patgirs or Pargirss, Sarvaiyas, Solankis, Khumans and Khachars, Makwanas, Padayas and Zalas. Most of the princely states of Kathiawar were brought under the British protectorate by 1820, but from Kathiawad first treaty with the British was made by Vira Wala (Kathi Ruler) of Jetpur with Colonel Walker at Baroda on 26 October 1803. === Literary comment === The state of the region in the early nineteenth century is illustrated in Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poem, Scene in Kattiawar, based on the print shown below (Travellers and Escort, 1830). === Political history === United Saurashtra (Kathiawar) State 1947-56 Before Indian independence in 1947, most of Kathiawar was divided into numerous princely states, ruled by local potentates who acknowledged British suzerainty in return for local sovereignty. These states comprised the Kathiawar Agency. The rest of the peninsula, chiefly in the east along the Gulf of Cambay, were districts ruled directly by the British as part of British India's Bombay Presidency, which included part of the peninsula. After Indian independence, the states of Kathiawar acceded to India. In 1947, Junagadh's Muslim ruler acceded his territory to Pakistan. The predominantly Hindu population rebelled, and while the prince fled to Pakistan, a plebiscite was conducted, after which the kingdom was merged into the Indian Union. The former princely states of Kathiawar were grouped into the new province of Saurashtra, which became the state of Saurashtra in 1950. In 1956, Saurashtra was merged into Bombay State, and in 1960, Bombay state was divided along linguistic lines into the new states of Gujarat (including Kathiawar) and Maharashtra. Diu remained in Portuguese hands until 1961, when it was occupied by Indian troops, then became integrated into India as part of the union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu in 1962. == Major cities == alt= The major cities of Kathiawar are Rajkot in the center of the peninsula, Jamnagar on the Gulf of Kutch, Bhavnagar on the Gulf of Khambhat, Surendranagar and the historic city Wadhwan in the central portion of Gujarat, Porbandar on the west coast, historic city of Junagadh on the South. Diu, an island town formerly part of Portuguese India and now part of the Indian union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, lies off the south coast of Kathiawar. The city of Somnath and its famous temple are also located on the south coast. == Districts in Kathiawar Region == * Amreli * Botad * Bhavnagar * Devbhoomi Dwarka * Gir Somnath * Jamnagar * Junagadh * Morbi * Porbandar * Rajkot * Surendranagar == Geography and ecosystem == Scene in Kattiawar, Travellers and Escort, 1830 The natural vegetation on most of the peninsula is xeric scrub, part of the Northwestern thorn scrub forests ecoregion. A range of low hills, known as the Gir Hills, occupies the south-central portion of the peninsula. The highest of these is Girnar. The hills are home to an enclave of tropical dry broadleaf forest, part of the Khathiar-Gir dry deciduous forests ecoregion. Accessed 16 September 2020. Gir National Park and surroundings host the last remaining Asiatic lion population. Other national parks on Kathiawar are Blackbuck National Park, Velavadar on the Gulf of Cambay, and Marine National Park, Gulf of Kutch near Jamnagar. == Antiquity (places: history, archaeology, nature, religion) == People of Mer Community (primarily found in Saurashtra) in one of the Sword dance forms Bhil women of Kathiawar, 1890 Gop Temple in Kathiawad, 1897. * Dwarika * Somnath * Sasan Gir and interiors / Kathi territories in Amreli-Bhavnagar districts * Vallabhi * Porbandar * Junagadh * Shatrunjay Hills, Palitana * Sihor * Palitana * Virpur (Rajkot) and Gondal * Jamnagar & Marine National Park * Velavadar * Old cities of Gondal, Wadhvan, Morbi, Wankaner * Diu, India == Notable characters and figures == The list of some divine, notable figures, characters and events related to Kathiawar-Saurashtra can be very exhaustive.

She was the first Navy ship named after Lieutenant John V. Johnston. The ship is widely known for her bold action in the Battle off Samar. The small \\"tincan\\" destroyer, armed with nothing larger than guns and torpedoes, would lead the attack of a handful of light ships which had inadvertently been left unprotected in the path of a massive Japanese fleet led by battleships and cruisers. The actions of Johnston and her little escort carrier task unit \\"Taffy 3\\" helped stop Admiral Kurita's Center Force from attacking vulnerable U.S. landing forces, and eventually inflicted greater losses to the Japanese attackers than they suffered. ==Construction and commissioning== Johnston was laid down on 6 May 1942 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corp., Seattle, Washington. She was launched on 25 March 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Marie S. Klinger, great-niece of her namesake, and was commissioned on 27 October 1943, Lieutenant Commander Ernest E. Evans in command. The day Johnston was commissioned, Cmdr. Evans made a speech to the crew, quoting a phrase attributed to John Paul Jones: \\"This is going to be a fighting ship. I intend to go in harm's way, and anyone who doesn't want to go along had better get off right now.\\" ==World War II service== During the Marshall Islands campaign, Johnston bombarded the beaches at Kwajalein on 1 February 1944, and made a five-day bombardment of Eniwetok from 17‚Äì22 February. She gave direct support to invasion troops there, destroying several pillboxes and taking revetments along the beach under fire. ===Sinking of I-176=== En route to patrol duty in the Solomons on 28 March, she bombarded Kapingamarangi Atoll in the Carolines. Johnston shelled an observation tower and several blockhouses, pillboxes, and dugouts along the beach. Two days later, she came into the mouth of the Maririca River, southeast of Empress Augusta Bay, Bougainville, Solomon Islands. After laying a heavy barrage into that area, she took up anti-submarine patrol off Bougainville. While performing this duty, on 15 May she sank the Japanese submarine using depth charges. ===Battle of Guam=== After three months of patrol in the Solomons, Johnston sailed to the Marshall Islands to prepare for the invasion and capture of Guam in the Marianas. On 21 July, she teamed up with the Pearl Harbor \\"ghost\\"‚Äîthe battleship ‚Äîto bombard Guam. The destroyer had sent in more than 4,000 rounds of shells by 29 July. Her accurate gunfire shattered the enemy's battery installations and numerous pillboxes and buildings. Johnston next helped protect escort carriers providing air support for the invasion and capture of Peleliu. ===Invasion of the Philippines=== The time had come for General Douglas MacArthur's long-awaited return to the Philippines. Following replenishment at Seeadler Harbor, Admiralty Islands, she sailed on 12 October to help protect the escort carriers maintaining air supremacy over eastern Leyte and the Gulf, sweeping the enemy off local airfields, giving troops direct support on the landing beaches from 20 October, and even destroying vehicle transport and supply convoys on the roads of Leyte itself. Johnston was operating with \\"Taffy 3\\" (Escort Carrier Task Unit 77.4.3) comprising Rear Admiral Clifton A. F. ‚ÄúZiggy‚Äù Sprague's flagship , five other escort carriers, three destroyers including herself, and four destroyer escorts. \\"Taffy 3\\" was one of the three units of Rear Admiral Thomas L. Sprague's Escort Carrier Task Group 77.4, known by their voice calls as \\"Taffy 1\\", \\"Taffy 2\\", and \\"Taffy 3\\". ===Engagement of Taffy 3=== On the morning of 23 October 1944, American submarines detected and attacked units of the Japanese fleet coming in from the South China Sea toward the precarious Leyte beachhead. The battleship- cruiser-destroyer Southern Force was decimated as it attempted to enter Leyte Gulf via Surigao Strait the night of 24‚Äì25 October. The more powerful battleship-cruiser-destroyer Center Force under Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita had been pounded by Admiral William ‚ÄúBull‚Äù Halsey's attack carrier planes and presumably turned back from San Bernardino Strait. Admiral Halsey then raced north with his attack carriers and heavy battleships to engage a decoy Japanese carrier‚Äìbattleship task force off Cape Engano. This left Johnston and her small escort carrier task unit as lonely sentinels in north Leyte Gulf, east of Samar and off San Bernardino Strait. As enemy ships fled the Battle of Surigao Strait at daybreak of 25 October, the powerful Japanese Center Force slipped through San Bernardino Strait and into the Philippine Sea heading toward Leyte Gulf. It steamed along the coast of Samar directly for Johnstons little task unit and the American invasion beachhead at Leyte, hoping to destroy amphibious shipping and American troops on shore. One of the pilots flying patrol after dawn alert that morning reported the approach of Japanese Center Force. Steaming straight for \\"Taffy 3\\" were four battleships (including the ), eight cruisers (two light and six heavy), and eleven destroyers. Lieutenant Robert C. Hagen, Johnstons gunnery officer, later reported, \\"We felt like little David without a slingshot.\\" In less than a minute, Johnston was zigzagging between the six escort carriers and the Japanese fleet and putting out a smoke screen over a front to conceal the carriers from the enemy gunners: \\"Even as we began laying smoke, the Japanese started lobbing shells at us and Johnston had to zigzag between the splashes.... We were the first destroyer to make smoke, the first to start firing, the first to launch a torpedo attack....\\" For the first 20 minutes, Johnston could not return fire as the enemy cruisers and battleships' heavy guns outranged Johnstons guns. Not waiting for orders, Commander Evans broke formation and went on the offensive by ordering Johnston to speed directly toward the enemy‚Äîfirst a line of seven destroyers, next one light and three heavy cruisers, then the four battleships. To the east appeared three other cruisers and several destroyers. As soon as range closed to within ten miles, Johnston fired on the heavy cruiser ‚Äîthe nearest ship‚Äîand scored several damaging hits. During her five- minute sprint into torpedo range, Johnston fired over 200 rounds at the enemy, then under the direction of torpedo officer Lieutenant Jack K. Bechdel, made her torpedo attack. She got off all 10 torpedoes, and turned to retire behind a heavy smoke screen. When she came out of the smoke a minute later, the Kumano could be seen burning furiously from a torpedo hit. Her bow had been blown completely off, and she was forced to withdraw. Around this time, Johnston took three shell hits from , followed closely by three shells‚Äîeither from a light cruiser or Yamato‚Äîwhich hit the bridge. The shells resulted in the loss of all power to the steering engine and all power to the three guns in the aft of the ship, and rendered the gyrocompass useless. A low-lying squall came up, and Johnston \\"ducked into it\\" for a few minutes of rapid repairs and salvage work. The bridge was abandoned and Commander Evans, who had lost two fingers on his left hand, went to the aft steering column to conn the ship. At 07:50, Admiral Sprague ordered destroyers to make a torpedo attack: \\"small boys attack\\". Johnston, unable to keep position with her damaged engine, and with her torpedoes already expended, nonetheless moved to provide fire support for the other destroyers. As she emerged from a smoke screen, she nearly collided with the destroyer . At 08:20, Johnston sighted a Kong≈ç-class battleship‚Äîonly away‚Äîemerging through the smoke. The destroyer opened fire, scoring multiple hits on the superstructure of the much larger ship. The return fire from the battleship missed clearly. Johnston soon observed under fire from an enemy cruiser, and engaged the cruiser in an effort to draw her fire away from the carrier. Johnston scored four hits on the heavy cruiser, then broke off as the Japanese destroyer squadron was seen closing rapidly on the American escort carriers. The Johnston engaged the lead ship until it quit, then the second until the remaining enemy units broke off to get out of effective gun range before launching torpedoes, all of which missed. Then, Johnstons luck ran out; she came under heavy fire from multiple enemy ships, and right when it was most needed, the damaged remaining engine quit, leaving her dead in the water. Some time into the battle, a Japanese battleship, Kong≈ç, fired two rounds from her main cannons. One round punched through the thin side armor of Johnston and cut a hole through the engine room. Her speed was cut in half. The enemy ships closed in for an easy kill, pouring fire into the crippled destroyer. Johnston took a hit that knocked out one forward gun and damaged another, and her bridge was rendered untenable by fires and explosions resulting from a hit in her ready ammunition locker. Evans, who had shifted his command to Johnstons fantail, was yelling orders through an open hatch to men turning her rudder by hand. At one of her batteries, a crewman kept calling \\"More shells! More shells!\\" Still the destroyer battled to keep the Japanese destroyers and cruisers from reaching the five surviving American carriers. \\"We were now in a position where all the gallantry and guts in the world couldn't save us, but we figured that help for the carrier must be on the way, and every minute's delay might count.... By 9:30 we were going dead in the water; even the Japanese couldn't miss us. They made a sort of running semicircle around our ship, shooting at us like a bunch of Indians attacking a prairie schooner. Our lone engine and fire room was knocked out; we lost all power, and even the indomitable skipper knew we were finished. At 9:45 he gave the saddest order a captain can give: 'Abandon Ship.'... At 10:10 Johnston rolled over and began to sink. The Japanese destroyer came up to and pumped a final shot into her to make sure she went down. A survivor saw the Japanese captain salute her as she went down, considering her an honorable enemy. That was the end of Johnston. Crewmen from the destroyer escort spotted Evans at the fantail, asking \\"isn't that their captain\\", waving to them with what they did not realize was his only good hand. From Johnstons complement of 327 officers and men, only 141 were saved. Of the 186 men lost, about 50 were killed by enemy action, 45 died later on rafts from wounds, and 92 men‚Äîincluding Cmdr. Evans‚Äîgot off before she sank, but were never seen again. ===Aftermath=== and also sacrificed themselves to save the escort carriers and to protect the landings at Leyte. Two of four Japanese heavy cruisers were sunk by combined surface and air attacks, and Admiral Sprague was soon amazed by the sight of the retirement of Kurita's entire fleet. By this time, planes of \\"Taffy 2\\" and \\"Taffy 1\\" and every available unit of the Fleet were headed to assist \\"Taffy 3\\". But Johnston and her little escort carrier task unit had stopped Admiral Kurita's powerful Center Force in the Battle off Samar, inflicting greater losses than they suffered. ==Awards== Johnstons supreme courage and daring in the Battle off Samar won her the Presidential Unit Citation as a unit of \\"Taffy 3\\" (Task Unit 77.4.3). Lt. Cmdr. Ernest E. Evans was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor: \\"The skipper was a fighting man from the soles of his broad feet to the ends of his straight black hair. He was an Oklahoman and proud of the Indian blood he had in him. We called him‚Äîthough not to his face‚Äîthe Chief. The Johnston was a fighting ship, but he was the heart and soul of her.\\" In addition to the Presidential Unit Citation, Johnston received six battle stars for service in World War II. ==Legacy== , was a Dealey-class destroyer escort named for Ernest E. Evans. She was launched in 1955 and stricken in 1973. No current ship carries the name of Evans, but there was a . In contrast, three current ships‚Äî, , and , all guided missile frigates‚Äîwere named for Samuel B. Roberts and members of her crew. The second Johnston was launched on 10 October 1945. On 27 February 1981, Johnston was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and transferred to the Republic of China (Taiwan). She served in the Republic of China Navy as the ROCS Chen Yang, and was later reclassified a guided missile destroyer, the DDG-928. Chen Yang was decommissioned on 16 December 2003. ==Wreck location== On 30 October 2019 it was announced that the research vessel of Vulcan Inc discovered what is believed to be the deepest shipwreck ever located at deep in the Philippine Trench; the wreck is in pieces with no significant hull sections located. The wreckage pieces found consist of two destroyed 5-inch turrets, a propeller shaft and propeller, two funnels, a mast, a barbette, and unidentified piles of twisted hull, interior, or machinery debris. A track mark in the mud was found leading deeper into the trench, possibly suggesting the main wreck slid deeper still after impacting onto the seabed. However, as the ROV was already at its operational limits, it was decided not to investigate further at the time. The crew believe that the wreck is Johnston based on the visible paint scheme on the turrets, but this is currently unconfirmed. == References == == Further reading == * * ==External links== * WW2DB: Johnston * NavSource.org - DD-557 * Dead in the Water by Evan Thomas * The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors by James D.

It comprises North Tarawa, which has 6,629 inhabitants and much in common with other more remote islands of the Gilberts group, and South Tarawa, which has 56,388 inhabitants , half of the country's total population.Country files at earth-info.nga.mil The atoll was the site of the Battle of Tarawa during World War II. ==Etymology== Tarawa is an old Gilbertese form for Te Rawa, meaning ‚ÄúThe Passage‚Äù (of the Lagoon), because Tarawa is quite a unique atoll in Kiribati with a large ship passage or channel to the lagoon Rawa. n. a passage, canal, passage through reef, a strait. Ernest Sabatier, Dictionnaire gilbertin-fran√ßais, 1952.. But in the popular etymology, due to Kiribati mythology, Nareau, the God-spider, distinguished Karawa, the sky, from Marawa, the Sea, from Tarawa, the land. ==Geography== Tarawa has a large lagoon, widely open to Ocean, with a large ship pass, in total area, and a wide reef. Although naturally abundant in fish and shellfish of all kinds, marine resources are being strained by the large and growing population. Drought is frequent, but in normal years rainfall is sufficient to maintain breadfruit, papaya and banana trees as well as coconut and pandanus. North Tarawa consists of a string of islets from Buariki in the north to Buota in the south. The islets are separated in places by wide channels that are best crossed at low tide, and there is a ferry service between Buota and Abatao. Only Buota is connected by road to South Tarawa, via a bridge. On South Tarawa, the construction of causeways has now created a single strip of land from Betio in the west to Tanaea in the northeast. ===Climate=== A tropical islet with palm s oriented in the direction of the prevailing winds. Tarawa features a tropical rainforest climate under the K√∂ppen climate classification. The climate is pleasant from April to October, with predominant northeastern winds and stable temperatures close to . From November to March, western gales bring rain and occasional cyclones.Kiribati. Encyclop√¶dia BritannicaThomas, 3 Precipitation varies significantly between islands. For example, the annual average is 3,000 mm (120 in) in the north and 500 mm (20 in) in the south of the Gilbert Islands. Most of these islands are in the dry belt of the equatorial oceanic climatic zone and experience prolonged droughts. ==Administration== Map of the Tarawa atoll. The airplane symbol shows Bonriki International Airport. Tarawa atoll has three administrative subdivisions: Betio Town Council (or BTC), on Betio Islet; (or TUC), from Bairiki to Tanaea; and Eutan Tarawa Council (or ETC), for North Tarawa or Tarawa Ieta, consisting of all the islets on the east side from Buota northwards. The meaning of Teinainano is \\"down of the mast\\", alluding to the sail-shape of the atoll. South Tarawa hosts the capital of the Republic of Kiribati and was also the central headquarters of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands since 1895. The House of Assembly is in Ambo, and the State House is in Bairiki. The offices of the various ministries of the government range from Betio at the south-west extreme to Nawerewere (in an easterly island in its chain), close to Bonriki (International Airport) and Temwaiku. Settlements on North Tarawa include Buariki, Abaokoro, Marenanuka and Taborio. ===Diplomatic missions=== Three resident diplomatic missions exist: the embassy of People‚Äôs Republic of China (closed in 2003, re-opened in 2020), and the high commissions of Australia and New Zealand. ==History== Japanese World War II defenses on Tarawa In Kiribati mythology, Tarawa was the earth when the land, ocean and sky had not been cleaved yet by Nareau the spider. Thus after calling the sky karawa and the ocean marawa, he called the piece of rock that Riiki (another god that Nareau found) had stood upon when he lifted up the sky as, Tarawa. Nareau then created the rest of the islands in Kiribati and also Samoa. Gilbertese arrived on these islands thousands of years ago, and there have been migrations to and from Kiribati since antiquity.North Tarawa Socioeconomic Report 2008. Secretariat of the Pacific Community and Government of Kiribati Evidence from a range of sources, including carbon dating and DNA analyses, confirms that the exploration of the Pacific included settlement of the Gilbert Islands by around 200 BC. The people of Tungaru (native name of the Gilbertese) are still excellent seafarers, capable of making ocean crossings in locally made vessels using traditional navigation techniques. Thomas Gilbert, captain of the East India Company vessel , was the first European to describe Tarawa, arriving on 20 June 1788. He did not land. He named it Matthew Island, after the owner of his ship Charlotte. He named the lagoon, Charlotte Bay. Gilbert's 1788 sketches survive. US Ex Ex survey The island was surveyed in 1841 by the US Exploring Expedition. Charles Richard Swayne, the first Resident Commissioner decided to install the central headquarters of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands protectorate in Tarawa in 1895. Tarawa Post Office opened on 1 January 1911. Sir Arthur Grimble was a cadet administrative officer based at Tarawa (1913‚Äì1919) and became Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony in 1926. With the Marines at Tarawa documentary film, 1944 (0:20:10) During World War II, Tarawa was occupied by the Japanese, and beginning on 20 November 1943 it was the scene of the bloody Battle of Tarawa. On that day United States Marines landed on Tarawa and fought Japanese soldiers occupying entrenched positions on the atoll. The Marines captured the island after 76 hours of intense fighting that killed 6,000 people on both sides. The fierce fighting was the subject of a documentary film produced by the Combat Photographers of the Second Marine Division entitled With the Marines at Tarawa. It was released in March 1944 at the insistence of President Roosevelt. It became the first time many Americans viewed American servicemen dead on film. The Kiribati Government commenced a road restoration project funded in part by the World Bank in 2014 to re- surface the main road between Betio in the West to Bonriki in the East,http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P122151/kiribati-road-rehabilitation- project?lang=en upgrading the main road that transits Tarawa from a dirt road. As of 2018, all that remained to be completed of this project was the sealing of Japanese Causeway, connecting Bairiki and Betio, done in 2019. ==Literature and journal== * A Pattern of Islands by Sir Arthur Grimble, John Murray & Co, London, 1952; republished 2011 by Eland, London, * Return to the Islands by Sir Arthur Grimble, John Murray & Co, London, 1957 * The 2004 book The Sex Lives of Cannibals by J.

In internal combustion engines, a variable-length intake manifold (VLIM),variable intake manifold (VIM), or variable intake system (VIS) is an automobile internal combustion engine manifold technology. As the name implies, VLIM/VIM/VIS can vary the length of the intake tract - in order to optimise power and torque across the range of engine speed operation, as well as help provide better fuel efficiency. This effect is often achieved by having two separate intake ports, each controlled by a valve, that open two different manifolds - one with a short path that operates at full engine load, and another with a significantly longer path that operates at lower load. The first patent issued for a variable length intake manifold was published in 1958, US Patent US2835235 by Daimler Benz AG.US Patent 2835235 There are two main effects of variable intake geometry: ;Swirl: Variable geometry can create a beneficial air swirl pattern, or turbulence in the combustion chamber. The swirling helps distribute the fuel and form a homogeneous air-fuel mixture - this aids the initiation of the combustion process, helps minimise engine knocking, and helps facilitate complete combustion. At low revolutions per minute (rpm), the speed of the airflow is increased by directing the air through a longer path with limited capacity (i.e., cross-sectional area) - and this assists in improving low engine speed torque. At high rpms, the shorter and larger path opens when the load increases, so that a greater amount of air with least resistance can enter the chamber - this helps maximise 'top-end' power. In double overhead camshaft (DOHC) designs, the air paths may sometimes be connected to separate intake valves so the shorter path can be excluded by de- activating the intake valve itself. ;Pressurisation: A tuned intake path can have a light pressurising effect similar to a low-pressure supercharger - due to Helmholtz resonance. However, this effect occurs only over a narrow engine speed band. A variable intake can create two or more pressurized \\"hot spots\\", increasing engine output. When the intake air speed is higher, the dynamic pressure pushing the air (and/or mixture) inside the engine is increased. The dynamic pressure is proportional to the square of the inlet air speed, so by making the passage narrower or longer the speed/dynamic pressure is increased. ==Applications== Many automobile manufacturers use similar technology with different names. Another common term for this technology is variable resonance induction system (VRIS). *Acura ‚Äî Variable Volume Induction 3.0-litre V6 C30A (1991-2005) and 3.2-litre V6 C32B (2002-2005); 3.2 L V6 J32A3 (2004-2008); 2.0-litre I4 R20A (2013-2015) petrol engines *Audi ‚Äî 2.8-litre V6 petrol engine (1991‚Äì98); 3.0-litre V6 (2002-2005); 3.6 and 4.2-litre V8 engines, 1987‚Äìpresent *Alfa Romeo ‚Äî Twin Spark 16v (1.8 and 2.0-litre) and JTS engines *BMW ‚Äî DISA (DIfferenzierte SaugAnlage - \\"Differential Air Intake\\"), two Port: M42, three Port: N52; DIVA (variable length runners): M54 etc. BMW's DIVA (Differentiated Variable Air Intake) used on the N62 V8 engine, is the world's first continuously variable length intake manifold. *Citro√´n ‚Äî XM 3,0 V6.24 (200 hp) used during 1991 to 1997, ZX Coupe 2.0 16v XU10J4 engine. *Daewoo ‚Äî Variable Geometry Induction System (VGIS) Lanos *Dodge / Chrysler ‚Äî 3.5 L V6 EGE, (1993-1997) used in Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde and LHS; 2.0 A588 - ECH (2001‚Äì2005) used in the 2001-2005 model year Dodge Neon R/T; 6.4 L V8 2011-2014 Dodge Charger and Challenger, Chrysler 300, Jeep Grand Cherokee (SRT8 versions) *Ferrari ‚Äî 360 Modena, 550 Maranello, LaFerrari *Fiat - Controlled High Turbulence (1989‚Äì92, Fiat Croma CHT), StarJet engine, dubbed Port Deactivation (PDA), Variable Intake System on the 131HP 1.8 16V and on the 155 HP 2.0 20V Pratola Serra engine. *Ford ‚Äî Dual-Stage Intake (DSI), on their Duratec 2.5 and 3.0-litre V6s, and it was also found on the Yamaha V6 in the Taurus SHO.

It is still worn by members of the Royal Marines after passing the Commando Course and personnel from other units of the Royal Navy, Army and RAF who serve within 3 Commando Brigade and who have passed the All Arms Commando Course. There are certain other military organizations that also wear the green beret because they have regimental or unit histories that have a connection with the British Commandos of the Second World War. These include the Australian, French and Dutch commandos. It is the norm in the armed forces of the Commonwealth Nations, where most regiments wear headdresss and cap badges which reflect regimental history and traditions. ==Origins== Initially, those who joined the British Commandos kept their parent regimental headdress and cap badges. In 1941, No. 1 Commando had no fewer than 79 different cap badges and many different forms of headdress. \\"Thus a motley collection of caps, Tam o' Shanters, bonnets, forage caps, caps 'fore and aft', berets, peaked KD caps, etc., appeared on the Commando parades,\\" says Captain Oakley, \\"the forest being a veritable RSM‚Äôs nightmare!\\" No. 2 Commando and No. 9 Commando faced with the same problem had adopted the Tam o' Shanter, but, as a traditional Scottish headdress, this was not considered suitable for what was a British unit. After some discussion it was agreed that if No. 1 Commando was to adopt a uniformed headdress then the beret, which had been worn by the Tank Regiment since the First World War (and had recently been adopted by the Parachute Regiment), would meet the requirements: it had no British regional affinity, it was difficult to wear improperly, and it could be easily stowed away without damage (when for example tin hats were in use). Having decided on the headdress, the next question to be resolved was the colour. The shoulder insignia of No. 1 Commando had been designed by the Richmond Herald at the College of Arms. It incorporated three colours in its design of a green salamander going through fire: red, yellow and green. Green was chosen as the most suitable. A Scottish firm of tam-o-shanter makers in Irvine (Ayrshire) was chosen to design and manufacture the beret.There is a dependency in the sources. The Royal Marines Museum write \\"tam-oshanter makers in Irvine (Ayrshire)\\" while Oakley writes \\"Luckily there was a factory close by at Ardrossan specialising in the manufacture of Scottish bonnets, etc.\\" (, ) Once the design was agreed, Brigadier Robert Laycock was approached by No. 1 Commando to seek his permission to wear it. He had been pondering on what the commandos should use for their headdress, and welcomed the green beret as a chance to introduce it as standard for all commando formations, with No. 1 Commando being the first to don them. The proposal that the commandos should start wearing green beret as their official headdress was submitted to the Chief of Combined Operations and forwarded by Lord Mountbatten to the Under- Secretary of State for War. Approval was granted and in October 1942 the first green berets were issued to the Royal Marines. ==Australian commandos== Australian Commando berets are known as being \\"Sherwood Green\\" in colour. The corps badge on the beret is a black background and a gold combat dagger with the motto \\"Foras Admonitio\\" meaning \\"Without Warning\\" across the dagger. The green beret is only awarded to a soldier upon becoming qualified as a Commando in either of the below regiments. *1st Commando Regiment *2nd Commando Regiment. Formerly 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, a special forces unit of the Australian Army ==Belgian paracommandos== Consisting of two battalions within the light brigade, only the 2nd Commando Battalion inherited the green beret along with other traditions from the 4th Troop of No.10 Commando. These paracommandos are the only \\"green berets\\" that are no longer a special operations force, but are considered to be elite. However, the Belgian special forces usually only recruits from paracommandos. ==Dutch commandos== The Special Forces of the Netherlands consist mainly of the KCT (Korps Commando Troepen). Their motto is \\"Nunc aut Nunquam\\" which is Latin for \\"Now or Never\\". The roots of the KCT go back to World War II. Under the name No. 2 (Dutch) Troop, the first Dutch commandos were trained in Achnacarry, Scotland, as part of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando. The unit was formed on March 22, 1942, the birthday of the present KCT. Members of the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps also receive upon completion of the Commando Course a green beret, but with the gold anchor on a red background. ==French commandos== Commandos Marine beret The Commandos Marine are an elite special operations unit of the French Navy. Formed from Fusiliers Marins during the Second World War in Britain, they wear the same green berets, pulled right, as the British Commandos. They are called b√©rets verts (green berets). ==Italian Navy's Special Forces== COMSUBIN berets on march The COMSUBIN are the elite special operations unit of the Italian Navy. The Royal Italian Navy's Naval Assault Divisions is considered to be the precursor of modern Naval Special Forces. They are called baschi verdi (green berets). == Portuguese Paratroopers == Portuguese Army Paratroopers The Portuguese Paratroopers (Portuguese: Tropas Paraquedistas) are an elite infantry assault force, representing the bulk of the airborne forces of Portugal. They were created in 1956 as part of the Portuguese Air Force, being transferred to the Portuguese Army in 1993. Presently, most of the Paratroopers are part of the Portuguese Rapid Reaction Brigade which comprises all 3 special forces troops. The Portuguese Paratroopers were usually nicknamed \\"Paras\\" or \\"Green Berets\\" (Boinas Verdes). == Portuguese Special Operations ( Army Rangers) == The unit members wear a moss/dry green beret and are the heir of the Special Hunters: the beret badge includes a hunting horn‚Äîa symbol of the Special Hunters; and the unit is known as Rangers because the first instructors of the Special Hunters completed the Ranger Course and adapted the characteristics of that training to the Special Operations Course. This special forces unit has operated in Bosnia and Herzegovina, East-Timor, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. ==Royal Marine Commandos== Royal Marine (2012) In the United Kingdom all Royal Marines who have passed the Commando Course wear the green beret. Personnel from the Royal Navy, British Army, and Royal Air Force volunteering for service with 3 Commando Brigade undertake the All Arms Commando Course, completion of which allows individuals to wear the headdress. Commando-qualified Royal Marines always wear the green beret, with the Globe and Laurel cap badge and commando- qualified personnel from other armed services wear the beret, with their own cap badge, when serving with commando units unless otherwise authorised. The Special Boat Service (SBS) also wear the green Commando beret but with their own cap badge consisting of a sword with two blue waved lines with the words \\"by strength and guile\\" The Commando Badge of a Fairbairn-Sykes The Fairbairn- Sykes Commando Dagger by Leroy Thompson and Knives of War: An International Guide to Military Knives from World War I to the Present by Gordon Hughes, Barry Jenkins, and Robert A.

Personal attached to the MCOE (Mando Conjunto de Operacionais Especiales/Joint Special Opeations Command) wear a green beret with the badge of the joint three military branches. ==United States Army Special Forces== Special Forces soldiers wearing their green berets Special Forces soldiers prepare for a combat diving training operation on a US Naval ship near Okinawa, Japan in 1956, wearing green berets prior to their approved wear in 1961. In the U.S. armed forces, the green beret may be worn only by soldiers awarded the Special Forces Tab, signifying they have been qualified as Special Forces (SF) soldiers. The Special Forces beret is officially designated \\"beret, man's, wool, rifle green, army shade 297\\". U.S. Special Forces wear the green beret as a distinction of excellence and uniqueness within the Army. The 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) had many OSS World War II veterans in their ranks when it was formed in 1952. They began to unofficially wear a berets of varying colour while training. The color green became favored because it was reminiscent of the World War II British Commando-type beret. The 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) deployed to Bad Tolz, Germany in September 1953. The remaining cadre at Fort Bragg formed the 77th Special Forces Group. Members of the 77th SFG began searching through their collections of berets and settled on the Rifle Green colour of the British Rifle Regiments (as opposed to the Lovat Green of the Commandos) from Captain Mike de la Pena's collection. Captain Frank Dallas had the new beret designed and produced in small numbers for the members of the Special Forces. Their new headdress was first worn at a retirement parade at Fort Bragg on 12 June 1955 for Lieutenant General Joseph P. Cleland, the now-former commander of the XVIII Airborne Corps. Onlookers thought that the commandos were a foreign delegation from NATO.P.32, \\"Inside the Green Berets\\" by Charles Simpson III In 1956 General Paul D. Adams, the post commander at Fort Bragg, banned its wear, even though it was worn surreptitiously when deployed overseas. This was reversed on 25 September 1961 by Department of the Army Message 578636, which designated the green beret as the exclusive headdress of the Army Special Forces. When visiting the Special Forces at Fort Bragg on 12 October 1961, President John F. Kennedy asked Brigadier General William P. Yarborough to make sure that the men under his command wore green berets for the visit. Later that day, Kennedy sent a memorandum which included the line: \\"I am sure that the green beret will be a mark of distinction in the trying times ahead\\". By America's entry into the Vietnam War, the green beret had become a symbol of excellence throughout the US Army. On April 11, 1962 in a White House memorandum to the United States Army, President Kennedy reiterated his view: \\"The green beret is a symbol of excellence, a badge of courage, a mark of distinction in the fight for freedom\\". To no avail, both Yarborough and Edson Raff had previously petitioned the Pentagon to allow wearing of the green beret. The President, however, did not fail them. In addition to being the headdress of the United States Army Special Forces, \\"Green Berets\\" is also a well known nickname of the organization. 60th Infantry RGT, 172nd Infantry BDE wearing olive-drab beret, ca. 1970s Of historical note, an olive drab green beret was worn by the U.S. Army's 172nd Infantry Brigade stationed in Alaska from 1973 to 1979 when the US Department of the Army's morale-enhancing order was in force and various colored berets began to be worn by numerous units and branches of the US Army.The Beret in U.S. Military Uniform History, The Balance Careers, by Rod Powers, updated 27 June 2019, last accessed 14 September 2019US Army berets - blue, black, green, maroon, tan..., The US Militaria Forum, last accessed 23 March 2020 ==References== ==Further reading== * * Category:Berets Category:Commandos ","title":"Green beret"},{"id":"845660","text":"Stater issued by verica Verica (early 1st century AD) was a British client king of the Roman Empire in the years preceding the Claudian invasion of 43 AD. From his coinage, he appears to have been king of the, probably Belgic, Atrebates tribe and a son of Commius. He succeeded his elder brother Eppillus as kinghttps://www.britannica.com/place/United-Kingdom/Roman-Britain#ref482473 in about 15 AD, reigning at Calleva Atrebatum, today called Silchester. He was recognised as rex by Rome and appears to have had friendly trade and diplomatic links with the empire. His territory was pressed from the east by the Catuvellauni, led by Epaticcus, brother of Cunobelinus, who conquered Calleva in about 25 AD. After Epaticcus's death ca. 35 AD Verica regained some territory, but Cunobelinus's son Caratacus took over and conquered the entire kingdom some time after 40 AD. Dio Cassius records that \\"Bericus\\" (almost certainly Verica) was expelled from Britain around this time during a revolt.Dio Cassius, Roman History 60:19 Suetonius refers to demands by the Britons that Rome return \\"certain deserters\\".Suetonius, Claudius 17 As rex, Verica was nominally an ally of Rome, so his exile gave Claudius an excuse to begin his invasion. Verica's relationship with Rome has been used to argue for the site of the Roman invasion of Britain as being along the south coast to assist him, rather than being at the traditional spot at Richborough in Kent. After the invasion, Verica may have been restored as king, but this is not attested in the historical or archaeological record. In any case a new ruler for the region, Cogidubnus, soon appeared. Cogidubnus may have been an heir of Verica who by this time would have been very elderly indeed. ==References== ==External links== *Atrebates at Roman-Britain.org *Atrebates at Romans in Britain *Coinage of Verica at The Celtic Coin Index Category:Briton rulers Category:Celtic warriors Category:1st-century monarchs in Europe ","title":"Verica"},{"id":"845661","text":"Paramilitary groups were formed throughout the Weimar Republic in the wake of Germany's defeat in World War I and the ensuing German Revolution. Some were created by political parties to help in recruiting, discipline and in preparation for seizing power. Some were created before World War I. Others were formed by individuals after the war and were called \\"Freikorps\\" (Free corps). The party affiliated groups and others were all outside government control, but the Freikorps units were under government control, supply and pay (usually through army sources). After World War I, the German Army was restricted to 100,000 men, so there were a great number of Imperial German Army soldiers suddenly de-mobilized. Many of these men were hardened into a Frontgemeinschaft, a front-line community. It was a spirit of camaraderie that was formed due to the length and horrors of trench warfare of World War I. These paramilitary groups filled a need for many of these soldiers who suddenly lost their \\"family\\"‚Äîthe army. Many of those soldiers were filled with angst, anger and frustration over the loss and horror of the war. Paramilitary groups were quite active in the ill-fated Republic, sometimes used to seize power and other times to quell disturbances. Freikorps were used in the Baltic region in 1919 by General R√ºdiger von der Goltz to protect German interests against Russia. Other Freikorps members engaged in sabotage acts against French and Belgian occupying forces in the Ruhr in 1923 by blowing up bridges. Yet other Freikorps orchestrated the Kapp Putsch and the Beer Hall Putsch. The Communists used their groups to seize power in several places in the Weimar Republic at different times, forming R√§terepubliken. Other paramilitary groups were used to quell these uprisings. Freikorps events are displayed in the Weimar Timeline. The political parties used their paramilitary groups to protect their party gatherings and to disrupt the marches and meetings of their opponents. Between 1928 and 1932, the Weimar Republic experienced a growth of political violence between these organizations euphemistically called Zusammenst√∂sse (lit. clashes). For instance in 1930, the Nazis claimed 17 fatalities and the Communists 44 fatalities in these Zusammenst√∂ssen. Scores were injured; in 1930, 2,500 Nazis were injured and in 1932, 9,715. (1) ==Freikorps== Freikorps were the brainchild of Major Kurt von Schleicher. The Freikorps were also called the \\"Black Reichswehr\\" (Black Army) for they were a 'secret' army outside the bounds of the Versailles Treaty. The idea was developed after the failure of an army unit to quell a small rebellion in Berlin at the Battle of the Schloss. The army unit, when confronted by a socialist group with women and children, threw down their weapons and either ran away or joined the protest group. This led Major von Schleicher to conceive an alternative to using Reichswehr units to quell \\"red\\" (socialist or communist) uprisings. He suggested to his superiors to form volunteer units recruited from the old Reichswehr and commanded by former Imperial officers under governmental control. This way the Reichswehr would avoid the stigma of having to fire on civilians and the government would be financially supporting these freikorps, leaving the Reichswehr to concentrate on training for real battle. Men who joined these units were called \\"Freebooters\\", and they often held strong right-wing and nationalist political views. The central Berlin government thought along with the central Reichswehr command that by paying and arming these 'black' soldiers, they might be able 'to tie them to the crib' and thus render them harmless. The first organizer of a Freikorps unit was General Ludwig Maercker. His unit, the \\"Maercker Volunteer Rifles\\", were soon called to rush from city to city stamping out socialist uprisings. Because his unit was called upon to every corner of Germany, he hit upon the idea of forming Einwohnerwehren, local citizen militias to keep the peace. Later on, these groups grew into the Orgesch, (Organization Escherich) reserve militia units for the German Wehrmacht. They were under the command of Dr. Georg Escherich. ;Other units were: *Freikorps von L√ºttwitz named and commanded by General Walther Freiherr von L√ºttwitz. This was an umbrella group with the following groups under it: **Potsdam Freikorps with 1,200 veterans **remnants of the Guards Rifle Cavalry Division **Reinhard Freikorps commanded by Colonel Wilhelm Reinhard. ***Freikorps Suppe (a separate unit under the Reinhard Freikorps) with 1,500 men *von Roeder's Scouts *Iron Brigade from Kiel *Kuntzel Freikorps *Ostara League *Freikorps Oberland/Bund Oberland *Marinebrigade Ehrhardt. They were the first to use the swastika as a unit symbol. They participated in the Kapp Putsch in 1920. *Viking League (Bund Wiking) ==Groups affiliated to political parties== *Right-wing **Der Stahlhelm (The Steel helmet, League of front-line Soldiers), officially a veterans' organization, it was the largest organisation stemming from the Freikorps with about 500,000 members. It was led by Theodor Duesterberg and was opposed to the Weimar Republic and politically close to the DNVP and other conservative parties. The Stahlhelm organized an employment service for its unemployed working-class members and a housing program. In 1931, it formed part of the Harzburg Front. In 1934 it was integrated into the SA and in 1935 dissolved. **Deutschv√∂lkischer Schutz und Trutzbund (German Nationalist Protection and Defiance Federation) **Sturmabteilung (SA) (storm troop), affiliated to the Nazi Party. Its leadership was purged by Hitler in the Night of the Long Knives in 1934. One SA section (originally called Stosstrupp) was created as Hitler's personal body guard and would develop into the Schutzstaffel (SS). **Kampfbund (Battle League) was an umbrella group involving NSDAP paramilitary groups, Freikorps Oberland and Bund Reichskriegsflagge (Imperial war flag League) It was created on 30 September 1923 and disbanded after the failed Beer Hall Putsch. **Jungdeutscher Orden, led by Artur Mahraun. He distanced his group from the Nazis because his group was fundamentally hostile to political parties. In 1930, its political arm merged with the DDP to form the DStP. *Centrists **Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold (Imperial Banner Black-Red- Gold), devoted to the defense of the Weimar Republic, politically close to the SPD and the liberal DDP. It was part of the Iron Front meant to counter the right-wing Harzburg Front. In 1933 the organisation was banned. **Eiserne Front (Iron Front) was established in 1931 against the Harzburg Front. It was banned in 1933. *Left-wing **Rotfrontk√§mpferbund (Red Front Fighters' League), affiliated with the KPD. It was banned in 1929. **Other communist groups affiliated with the KPD included the Antifaschistische Junge Garde (Young Antifascist Guard), the Kampfbund gegen den Faschismus (Fighting League against Fascism), and Antifaschistische Aktion. They were banned in 1933. Also the Red Army of Ruhr was active during 1920. Similar organisations also existed in the Republic of Austria, most notably the Schutzbund and the Heimwehr. ==See also== *Glossary of the Weimar Republic *Weimar political parties *Oskar von Hutier *Organisation Consul ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * ==Further reading== *Waite, Robert G.

Although his two older siblings followed their father's career path, he instead chose to study medicine at Lund, beginning in 1941. In 1944, he participated in the task of examining prisoners of Nazi concentration camps, whom Swedish aristocrat Folke Bernadotte had managed to bring to Sweden, which was neutral during World War II. He received his MD and PhD in pharmacology in 1951. == Career == In 1951, Carlsson became an associate professor at Lund University. He spent five months as a research fellow for the pharmacologist Bernard Beryl Brodie at the National Heart Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, United States, and the change in his research focus to psychopharmacology eventually led to his Nobel Prize. In 1959 he became a professor at the University of Gothenburg. In 1957 Kathleen Montagu demonstrated the presence of dopamine in the human brain; later that same year Carlsson also demonstrated that dopamine was a neurotransmitter in the brain and not just a precursor for norepinephrine. Carlsson went on to develop a method for measuring the amount of dopamine in brain tissues. He found that dopamine levels in the basal ganglia, a brain area important for movement, were particularly high. He then showed that giving animals the drug reserpine caused a decrease in dopamine levels and a loss of movement control. These effects were similar to the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. By administering to these animals L-Dopa, which is the precursor of dopamine, he could alleviate the symptoms. These findings led other doctors to try using L-Dopa in patients with Parkinson's disease, and it was found to alleviate some of the symptoms in the early stages of the disease. L-Dopa is still the basis for most commonly used means of treating Parkinson's disease. Carlson collaborated with the drug company Astra AB (now AstraZeneca) during the 1970s and the 1980s. He and his colleagues were able to derive the first marketed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), zimelidine, from brompheniramine. Zimelidine was later withdrawn from the market due to rare cases of Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, but Carlson's research paved the way for fluoxetine (Prozac), one of the most widely used prescription medicines in the world. Carlsson was still an active researcher and speaker when he was over 90 years old, and together with his daughter Lena, he worked on OSU6162, a dopamine stabilizer which alleviates symptoms of post-stroke fatigue. == Honours and awards == Carlsson's research on the brain's chemical signals and the resulting treatment for Parkinson's disease earned him the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which he shared with Paul Greengard and Eric R. Kandel. He won many other awards including Israel's Wolf Prize in Medicine (1979), the Japan Prize (1994), and Italy's Feltrinelli Prize (1999). He was elected as a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1975. == Personal life == Carlsson married Ulla-Lisa Christoffersson in 1945 and they had three sons and two daughters. His daughter Maria was his lab manager and his daughter Lena was one of his collaborators. He opposed the fluoridation of drinking water in Sweden.Fluoride in drinking water can cause cancer, Svenska Dagbladet (in Swedish)Bryson C. (2004) The Fluoride Deception. Seven Stories Press. p. p. 240. . He was a vocal opponent of homeopathy and worked to prevent homeopathic preparations from being classified as medication in Sweden. Carlsson died on 29 June 2018, at the age of 95. ==References== ==External links== * including the Nobel Lecture December 8, 2000 A Half- Century of Neurotransmitter Research: Impact on Neurology and Psychiatry *The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg Category:Swedish neuroscientists Category:Swedish pharmacologists Category:Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine Category:People connected to Lund University Category:Wolf Prize in Medicine laureates Category:Swedish Nobel laureates Category:University of Gothenburg faculty Category:Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences Category:People from Uppsala Category:1923 births Category:2018 deaths Category:20th-century Swedish scientists Category:21st- century Swedish scientists ","title":"Arvid Carlsson"},{"id":"845665","text":"Kintaro Hayakawa (Êó©Â∑ù ÈáëÂ§™ÈÉé ; June 10, 1889 ‚Äì November 23, 1973), known professionally as Sessue Hayakawa (Êó©Â∑ù Èõ™Ê¥≤), was a Japanese actor and a matin√©e idol. He was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood during the silent film era of the 1910s and early 1920s. Hayakawa was the first actor of Asian descent to achieve stardom as a leading man in the United States and Europe. His \\"broodingly handsome\\" good looks and typecasting as a sexually dominant villain made him a heartthrob among American women during a time of racial discrimination, and he became one of the first male sex symbols of Hollywood. He made his breakthrough in The Cheat (1915), and thereafter became famous for his roles as a forbidden lover. Hayakawa was a highly paid star of his time, earning $3,500 a week in 1919 and $2 million through his own production company from 1918 to 1920. Because of rising anti-Japanese sentiment and business difficulties, Hayakawa left Hollywood in 1922 and performed on Broadway and in Japan and Europe for many years before making his Hollywood comeback in Daughter of the Dragon (1931). Of his talkies, Hayakawa is probably best known for his role as Colonel Saito in The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), for which he earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Hayakawa starred in over 80 feature films, and three of his films (The Cheat, The Dragon Painter, and The Bridge on the River Kwai) stand in the United States National Film Registry. ==Early life and career== Hayakawa in 1918 Hayakawa was born in the village of Nanaura, now part of a town called Chikura, in the city of Minamib≈çs≈ç in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, on June 10, 1886.Kizirian, Shari. The Dragon Painter. Silent Film Festival.Perpetually Cool: The Many Lives of Anna May Wong (1905-1961). p. 179. From a young age he yearned to go overseas and took on English studies in preparation. His father was the head of a fishermen's union with some wealth. He had five siblings. From an early age, Hayakawa's family intended him to become an officer in the Imperial Japanese Navy. However, while a student at the naval academy in Etajima, he swam to the bottom of a lagoon (he grew up in a shellfish diving community) on a dare and ruptured his eardrum. The injury caused him to fail the navy physical. His father felt shame and embarrassment by his son's failure and this drove a wedge between them. The strained relationship drove the 18-year-old Hayakawa to attempt seppuku (ritual suicide). One evening, Hayakawa entered a shed on his parents' property and prepared the venue. He put his dog outside and attempted to uphold his family's samurai tradition by stabbing himself more than 30 times in the abdomen. The barking dog brought Hayakawa's parents to the scene and his father used an axe to break down the door, saving his life. After he recovered from the suicide attempt, Hayakawa moved to the United States and began to study political economics at the University of Chicago to fulfill his family's new wish that he become a banker. While a student, he played quarterback for the football team and was once penalized for using jujitsu to bring down an opponent. Locke, Michelle. IN THE SILENT MOVIE ERA, HAYAKAWA BROKE HEARTS. Deseret News.King, James. Under Foreign Eyes. p. 18. Hayakawa graduated from the University of Chicago in 1912, and subsequently made plans to return to Japan.Sessue Hayakawa - Hollywood Star Walk. Los Angeles Times. He traveled to Los Angeles and awaited a transpacific steamship. During his stay, he discovered the Japanese Theatre in Little Tokyo and became fascinated with acting and performing plays. It was around this time that Hayakawa first assumed the stage name , meaning \\"snowy field\\" (Èõ™ means \\"snow\\" and Ê¥≤ means \\"north field\\").Chin, Frank. Born in the USA: A Story of Japanese America, 1889-1947. p. 14. One of the productions in which Hayakawa performed was called The Typhoon. Tsuru Aoki, a member of the acting troupe, was so impressed with Hayakawa's abilities and enthusiasm that she enticed film producer Thomas H. Ince to see the play. Ince saw the production and offered to turn it into a silent film with the original cast. Anxious to return to Japan, Hayakawa tried to dissuade Ince by requesting the then-astronomic fee of $500 a week, but Ince agreed to his request. However according to Daisuke Miyao, professor of Japanese language and literature at UC San Diego, Hayakawa‚Äôs turn to acting was in reality less dramatic. There are no records of him at University of Chicago, in course enrollments or football team rosters or otherwise. His acting career likely followed a series of odd jobs in California: dishwasher, waiter, ice cream vendor, and factory worker. His theatrical appearances seemed like another temporary pursuit. Author Orie Nakagawa writes that Hayakawa had always aimed to go to California, his plan being to first help his older brother who was working in San Francisco, and that it was only his father who had convinced him to study at Chicago, and so Hayakawa left his studies in his first year to head where he wanted to go in the first place. The Typhoon (1914) became an instant hit and was followed by two additional pictures produced by Ince, The Wrath of the Gods (1914) co- starring Hayakawa's new wife, Aoki, and The Sacrifice (1914). With Hayakawa's rising stardom, Jesse L. Lasky soon offered Hayakawa a contract, which he accepted, making him part of Famous Players-Lasky (now Paramount Pictures). ==Stardom== Hayakawa's second film for Famous Players-Lasky was The Cheat (1915), directed by Cecil B. DeMille. The Cheat co-starred Fannie Ward as Hayakawa's love interest and was a huge success, making Hayakawa a romantic idol and sex symbol to the female movie-going public. \\"It caused a sensation,\\" says Stephen Gong, the executive director of San Francisco's Center for Asian American Media. \\"The idea of the rape fantasy, forbidden fruit, all those taboos of race and sex‚Äîit made him a movie star. And his most rabid fan base was white women.\\" With his popularity and \\"broodingly handsome\\"Heartthrobs: A History of Women and Desire. p. 111‚Äì112. good looks, Hayakawa commanded a salary that reached over $3,500 a week at the height of his fame in 1919. In 1917, he built his residence, a castle-styled mansion, at the corner of Franklin Avenue and Argyle Street in Hollywood, which was a local landmark until it was demolished in 1956. Following The Cheat, Hayakawa became a leading man for romantic dramas in the 1910s and early 1920s.Bernardi, p. 71. He also began acting in Westerns and action films. Sought after for roles, but dissatisfied with being constantly typecast, Hayakawa decided to form his own production company. There is some lack of clarity on how Haworth Pictures Corporation got its original funding. Hayakawa offered two versions, one in his autobiography of William Joseph Connery, a fellow University of Chicago alumnus introducing him to A.B.C. Dohrmann, the president of a china and glassware company in San Francisco who was willing to pay one million dollars to establish the company, and one where Connery's own parents were multimillionaire coal mine owners who provided the million dollars. Hayakawa costumed as the Prince of the Island of Desire in a publicity still for the 1920 silent fantasy film The Beggar Prince Advertisement in Exhibitors Herald for the American drama film His Birthright with Hayakawa, Marin Sais, and Mary Anderson, 1918 Over the next three years, Hayakawa produced 23 films and had earned $2 million by 1920, of which he was able to pay back the 1 million he had loaned from Connery. Hayakawa produced, starred in, and contributed to the design, writing, editing, and directing of the films. Critics hailed Hayakawa's understated, Zen-influenced acting style. Hayakawa sought to bring muga, or the \\"absence of doing\\", to his performances, in direct contrast to the then-popular studied poses and broad gestures. In 1918, Hayakawa personally chose the American serial actress Marin Sais to appear opposite him in a series of films, the first being the racial drama The City of Dim Faces (1918), followed by His Birthright (1918), which also starred Aoki. His collaboration with Sais ended with Bonds of Honor (1919). Hayakawa also appeared opposite Jane Novak in The Temple of Dusk (1918) and Aoki in The Dragon Painter (1919). According to Goldsea Hayakawa's fame rivaled that of Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin and John Barrymore. Hayakawa drove a gold plated Pierce-Arrow and entertained lavishly in his \\"Castle\\", which was known as the scene of some of Hollywood's wildest parties. Shortly before Prohibition took effect in 1920, he bought a large supply of liquor, leading him to joke that he owed his social success to his liquor supply. He took Aoki on a trip to Monaco where he gambled at the Monte Carlo Casino. Hayakawa left Hollywood in 1922, for which different authors give various explanations such as prevailing anti-Japanese sentiment and business difficulties. Nakagawa focuses on three events in particular: firstly on the set of The Swamp (1921) his appendix ruptured and while he was at the hospital there was an attempt to usurp his insurance money, secondly there was a baseless tabloid report that Aoki had attempted suicide, and thirdly Hayakawa believed there was also an attempt on his life by the Robertson-Cole Pictures Corporation (also accused of supporting anti-Japanese legislation) for insurance money by the collapse of an unsafe earthquake sequence on the set of The Vermilion Pencil, leading to him suing the studio. He visited Japan with Aoki for the first time since he had come to the US. He returned back soon after however and played the lead role in Tiger Lily on Broadway in 1923. The next decade and a half saw him also perform in Japan and Europe.Hollywood Goes Oriental: CaucAsian Performance in American Film. p. 22.Flickers of Desire: Movie Stars of the 1910s. p. 110. In London, Hayakawa starred in The Great Prince Shan (1924) and The Story of Su (1924). In 1925, he wrote a novel, The Bandit Prince, and adapted it into a short play. In 1930, Hayakawa performed in Samurai, a one- act play written specifically for him, in front of Great Britain's King George V and Queen Mary. Hayakawa became widely known in France, where audiences \\"enthusiastically embraced\\" him and made his French debut, La Bataille (1923), a critical and financial success. German audiences found Hayakawa \\"sensational\\" and in Russia he was considered one of the \\"wonderful actors\\" of America. In addition to numerous Japanese films, Hayakawa also produced a Japanese-language stage version of The Three Musketeers. In the initial decades of his career, Hayakawa established himself as the first leading man of Asian descent in American and European cinema.Screen World Presents the Encyclopedia of Hollywood Film Actors: From the silent era to 1965, Volume 1. p. 318. He was also the first non-Caucasian actor to achieve international stardom.Historical Dictionary of Japanese Cinema. p. 78. ==Later career== Hayakawa with a flight attendant in New York, c. 1960 Returning to the United States again in 1926 to appear on Broadway‚Äîand later in vaudeville‚ÄîHayakawa opened a Zen temple and study hall on New York‚Äôs Upper West Side. Hayakawa later transitioned into doing talkies; his return to Hollywood and sound film debut came in Daughter of the Dragon (1931), starring opposite Chinese American performer Anna May Wong. His accent did not go over well when sound was added to movies. Hayakawa played a Samurai in the German-Japanese co- production The Daughter of the Samurai (1937). The same year, Hayakawa went to France to perform in Yoshiwara (1937), but ended up trapped in the country and separated from his family when the German occupation of France began in 1940. Hayakawa made few films in the following years, but financially supported himself by selling his watercolor paintings. He became friends with writer Jir≈çhachi Satsuma who was also stuck in France. Goldsea states that he joined the French Resistance and helped Allied flyers during World War II, although Hayakawa lists mainly helping the local Japanese community during the war and after. His nomadic lifestyle continued until 1950. In 1949, Humphrey Bogart's production company located Hayakawa and offered him a role in Tokyo Joe. Before issuing a work permit, the American Consulate investigated Hayakawa's activities during the war and found that he had in no way contributed to the German war effort. Hayakawa followed Tokyo Joe with Three Came Home (1950), in which he played real-life POW camp commander Lieutenant-Colonel Suga, before returning to France. After the war, Hayakawa's on-screen roles can best be described as \\"the honorable villain\\", a figure exemplified by his portrayal of Colonel Saito in The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957). The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Hayakawa earned a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor; he was also nominated for a Golden Globe for the role that he called the highlight of his career. After the film, Hayakawa largely retired from acting. Throughout the following years he performed guest appearances on a handful of television shows and films, making his final performance in the animated film The Daydreamer (1966). After retiring, Hayakawa dedicated himself to Zen Buddhism, became an ordained Zen master, worked as a private acting coach, and wrote his autobiography Zen Showed Me the Way. ==Racial barriers== Throughout Hayakawa's career, many segments of the American society were filled with feelings of anti-Japanese sentiment, partly from nationalism rising from World War I and World War II. This left Hayakawa constantly typecast as a villain or forbidden lover and unable to play parts that would be given to white actors such as Douglas Fairbanks. Hayakawa stated: \\"Such roles [in The Wrath of the Gods, The Typhoon, and The Cheat] are not true to our Japanese nature... They are false and give people a wrong idea of us. I wish to make a characterization which shall reveal us as we really are.\\" In 1949, he lamented, \\"My one ambition is to play a hero\\". Hayakawa can be seen as a precursor to Rudolph Valentino, 9 years his junior. Both were foreign born, typecast as exotic or forbidden lovers, wildly popular for their time. His contract with Famous Players expired in May 1918, but the studio still asked him to star in The Sheik. Hayakawa refused the picture in favor of starting his own company, most likely not happy with another \\"forbidden villain lover\\" role. With influence from June Mathis, the role went to the barely known Valentino and turned him into a screen icon overnight. In 1930, the Production Code came into effect (enforced after 1934) which forbade portrayals of miscegenation in film. This meant that unless Hayakawa's co-star was an Asian actress, he would not be able to portray a romance with her. Hayakawa was placed into an awkward position due to his ethnicity and fame in the English-speaking world. Due to naturalization laws of that time, Hayakawa would be unable to become a U.S. citizen and because of anti-miscegenation laws he could not marry someone of another race. Hayakawa's early films were not popular in Japan because many felt that his roles portrayed an image of Japanese men being sadistic and cruel. Many Japanese viewers found this portrayal‚Äîwhich made him popular in the U.S.‚Äîinsulting. Nationalistic groups in particular were censorious. Some Japanese believed that Hayakawa was contributing to increased anti-Japanese sentiment in the U.S., and regarded him as a traitor to the Japanese people. After Hayakawa established himself as an American superstar, the negative tone in the press that regarded him as a national and racial shame lessened by a noticiable degree, and Japanese media started publicizing Hayakawa's cinematic achievements instead.Flickers of Desire: Movie Stars of the 1910s. p. 111‚Äì112. His later films were also not popular, because he was seen as \\"too Americanized\\" during a time of nationalism. ==Personal life== Hayakawa and his wife, Tsuru Aoki, in the 1919 film The Dragon Painter On May 1, 1914, Hayakawa married fellow Issei and performer Tsuru Aoki, who co-starred in several of his films. Hayakawa's first child, a son, was born in New York in 1929, to a white actress named Ruth Noble, a vaudeville co-performer from The Bandit Prince. Noble sued for custody but lost the case. The boy was known as Alexander Hayes, but his name was changed to Yukio after Sessue and Aoki adopted the child and took him to be raised and educated in Japan. Later, they adopted two more daughters: Yoshiko, an actress, and Fujiko, a dancer. Aoki died in 1961. Physically, Hayakawa possessed \\"an athlete's physique and agility\\". A 1917 profile on Hayakawa stated that he \\"is proficient in jiu-jitsu, an expert fencer, and can swim like a fish. He is a good horseman and plays a fast tennis racket. He is tall for a Japanese, being five feet seven and a half inches in height, and weighs 157 pounds.\\"Goodwin's Weekly, Volume 28. p. 12. Hayakawa was known for his discipline and martial arts skills. While filming The Jaguar's Claws, in the Mojave Desert, Hayakawa played a Mexican bandit, with 500 cowboys as extras. On the first night of filming, the extras drank all night and well into the next day. No work was being done, so Hayakawa challenged the group to a fight. Two men stepped forward. Hayakawa said of the incident, \\"The first one struck out at me. I seized his arm and sent him flying on his face along the rough ground. The second attempted to grapple and I was forced to flip him over my head and let him fall on his neck. The fall knocked him unconscious.\\" Hayakawa then disarmed yet another cowboy. The extras returned to work, amused by the way the small man manhandled the big bruising cowboys. ==Death and legacy== Hayakawa's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Hayakawa retired from film in 1966. He died in Tokyo on November 23, 1973, from a cerebral thrombosis, complicated by pneumonia. He was buried in the Chokeiji Temple Cemetery in Toyama, Japan. Many of Hayakawa's films are lost. However, most of his later works, including The Bridge on the River Kwai, the Jerry Lewis comedy The Geisha Boy in which Hayakawa lampoons his role in The Bridge on the River Kwai, Swiss Family Robinson, Tokyo Joe, and Three Came Home are available on DVD. For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Hayakawa was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1645 Vine Street, in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. A musical based on Hayakawa's life, Sessue, played in Tokyo in 1989. In September 2007, the Museum of Modern Art held a retrospective on Hayakawa's work entitled: Sessue Hayakawa: East and West, When the Twain Met. Japanese film director Nagisa Oshima had planned to create a biopic entitled Hollywood Zen based on Hayakawa's life. The script had been allegedly completed and set to film in Los Angeles, but due to constant delays and the eventual death of Oshima himself in 2013, the project went unrealized. In 2020, Hayakawa‚Äôs life story was told as part of PBS‚Äôs documentary Asian Americans. His lasting legacy is large especially to the Asian-American community.Transnational Sport: Gender, Media, and Global Korea. p. 284.Embodying Asian/American Sexualities. p. 67. Media professor Karla Rae Fuller wrote in 2010: \\"What is even more remarkable about Hayakawa's precedent-setting career in Hollywood as an Asian American is the fact that he is virtually ignored in film history as well as star studies. ... Furthermore, the fact that he reached such a rare level of success whereby he could form and run his own production company makes his omission from the narrative of Hollywood history even more egregious.\\" ==Filmography== ==See also== * Portrayal of East Asians in Hollywood * Stereotypes of East Asians in American media ==References== Notes Bibliography * Documentary films * 2006 ‚Äî The Slanted Screen: Asian Men in Film and Television.

He was admitted to the bar and practiced law in Virginia and Lexington, Kentucky. After making a permanent move to Kentucky he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1806, 1810 and again in 1817. He was appointed a judge of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in 1808 and then chief justice through 1810. ==Career== In 1811 he was elected to the United States Senate from Kentucky and served until 1814 when he again returned to Lexington to work as a lawyer. He moved to Frankfort, Kentucky in 1816 and sided with the New Court faction in the Old Court-New Court controversy in the 1820s. He was again named Chief Justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in 1827, serving for a year. He was re-elected to the United States Senate in 1829 and served as a Jacksonian Democrat through 1835. During the 21st Congress he was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Post Office and Post Roads. Bureau of Engraving and Printing portrait of Bibb as Secretary of the Treasury. He was chancellor of the Louisville Chancery Court from 1835 through 1844 and in 1844 became President John Tyler's fourth United States Secretary of the Treasury serving through 1845. He was a very aged man when he assumed his Treasury position, dressing \\"in antique style, with kneebreeches.\\" Bibb's Annual Report on the State of the Finances for 1844 consisted of an elaborate compilation of statistics detailing the financial history of the nation since 1789. In addition, he presented a solid argument for the establishment of a \\"sinking fund,\\" accumulated through regular deposits and used to pay the interest and principal on the national debt. Bibb advocated using Treasury surplus revenue from customs and internal revenue collection to supply the sinking fund. Such a fund had been used effectively to reduce the deficit from 1789 to 1835, but Bibb was unable to revive it. After this he was a lawyer in Washington, D.C., and an assistant in the U.S. Attorney General's office. He was an active Freemason. He was the first master of Russellville Lodge No. 17, Russellville, Kentucky and was master of Hiram Lodge No. 4, in Frankfort.

A place of solace and occasional headquarters for Superman, the fortress is typically depicted as being in frozen tundra, away from civilization. Its predecessor, Superman's \\"Secret Citadel\\", first appeared in Superman #17, where it was said to be built into a mountain on the outskirts of Metropolis. By issue #58 (May‚ÄìJune 1949) it is referred to as the Fortress of Solitude, seems at a glance to be a freestanding castle, and is said to be located in a \\"polar waste\\". When the Fortress reappears in 1958 and for the first time takes center stage in a story (\\"The Super-Key to Fort Superman\\", Action Comics #241), it is again an underground complex in a mountainous cliffside. Traditionally, the Fortress of Solitude is located in the Arctic, though more recent versions of the Superman comics have placed the Fortress in other locations, including the Antarctic, the Andes, and the Amazon rainforest. The general public in Superman's world is either unaware or at best only vaguely aware of the existence of the Fortress, and its location is kept secret from all but Superman's closest friends and allies (such as Lois Lane and Batman). A trademark of the Fortress is that it contains a memorial statue of Jor-El and Lara, Superman's Kryptonian parents, holding a large globe of Krypton. Although Superman has living quarters at the Fortress, his main residence is still Clark Kent's apartment in Metropolis. The arctic Fortress of Solitude concept was first created for pulp hero Doc Savage during the 1930s. == Original version == Silver Age Fortress of Solitude, from Superman #187 (June 1966). Art by Curt Swan and George Klein. The concept and name \\"Fortress of Solitude\\" first appeared in the Doc Savage pulps in the 1930s and 1940s. Doc Savage built his Fortress of Solitude in the Arctic and retreated to it alone in order to make new scientific or medical breakthroughs, and to store dangerous technology and other secrets. The Golden Age Superman did not have an arctic fortress, but instead a \\"mountain sanctuary\\" which was located in a mountain range on the outskirts of Metropolis. Here, Superman kept a diary, oversized tools for various projects, and other equipment and trophies. Superman's Silver Age Fortress, which debuted in 1958, was also located in the Arctic and served similar purposes. Built into the side of a steep cliff, the Fortress was accessible through a large gold-colored door with a giant keyhole, which required an enormous key to open it. The arrow-shaped key was so large that only Superman (or another Kryptonian such as Supergirl) could lift it; when not in use, the key sat on a perch outside of the Fortress, where it appeared to be an aircraft path marker. This was until a helicopter pilot followed the direction of the arrow straight to the entrance of the Fortress, forcing Superman to develop a cloak to camouflage the entrance and key (which now hung on brackets on its side beside the door) and to ensure the Fortress's secrecy. The Fortress contained an alien zoo, a giant steel diary in which Superman wrote his memoirs (using either his invulnerable finger, twin hand touch pads that record thoughts instantly, or heat vision to engrave entries into its pages), a chess-playing robot, specialized exercise equipment, a laboratory where Superman worked on various projects such as developing defenses to kryptonite, a (room-sized) computer, communications equipment, and rooms dedicated to all of his friends, including one for Clark Kent to fool visitors. As the stories continued, it was revealed that the Fortress was where Superman's robot duplicates were stored. It also contained the Phantom Zone projector, various pieces of alien technology he had acquired on visits to other worlds, and, much like the Batcave, trophies of his past adventures. Indeed, the Batcave and Batman himself made an appearance in the first Fortress story. The Fortress also became the home of the bottle city of Kandor (until it was enlarged), and an apartment in the Fortress was set aside for Supergirl. A detailed depiction of the Fortress and its contents forms the background to DC Special Series #26 (1981); \\"Superman and his Incredible Fortress of Solitude\\", in which Superman minutely inspects the Fortress, suspecting an enemy has planted an Earth-destroying bomb within it. Another noteworthy appearance of this version of the Fortress was in 1985's Superman Annual #11, a story by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons titled \\"For the Man Who Has Everything\\", in which it served as a battleground for Superman, Batman, Robin, and Wonder Woman against the alien would-be overlord Mongul. This story was adapted to animation in the 2004 TV series Justice League Unlimited. In addition to Mongul, the Fortress has been independently broken into at various times by villains Lex Luthor and Brainiac (Action Comics #583 and Superman #423) and the Atomic Skull (DC Comics Presents #35), among others. According to Action Comics #261, Superman first established secret Fortresses in outer space and at the center of the Earth before settling on an Arctic location. Additionally, Superman established an undersea Fortress of Solitude ‚Äì hollowed out of the side of an undersea cliff ‚Äì in September 1958. The undersea Fortress, which is reportedly located at the bottom of the Sargasso Sea at 28 degrees North latitude, 50 degrees West longitude, is stocked with numerous exotic ocean relics and is equipped with sophisticated monitoring apparatus to enable Superman to keep abreast of events occurring throughout the seven seas. Superman later abandoned the undersea Fortress and the structure is now used by the mer-people of Atlantis as a showplace and a tourist attraction. The original version of the Fortress of Solitude made its last appearance in the 1986 non-canonical (or \\"imaginary\\") story \\"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\\". In this story, under constant attacks by returning foes, Superman goes to ground inside the Fortress, taking his closest friends with him for their protection. The villainous android Brainiac soon besieges the Fortress with various allies, surrounding it and the outlying territory with an impenetrable force field to keep Superman's fellow heroes from aiding him. Superman ultimately battles a newly evil Mister Mxyzptlk, who was behind the plot to destroy him. As Superman was forced to destroy Mxyzptlk, breaking his vow against killing, he exposes himself to gold kryptonite to permanently remove his powers and then appears to leave the Fortress to freeze to death in the Arctic cold. Superman is never seen again, although we find out in a \\"ten years later\\" wraparound segment set in 1997 that he survives as Jordan Elliot, husband of Lois Lane Elliot, and that they are the parents of toddler Jonathan Elliot, who has super- powers.https://www.comics.org/issue/41810/#237441https://www.comics.org/issue/61173/#305729 == Post-Crisis versions == Superheroes gather inside the Fortress of Solitude in Justice. Art by Alex Ross. In John Byrne's 1986 Man of Steel miniseries, which re-wrote various aspects of the Superman mythos, the Clark Kent persona was described as a \\"Fortress of Solitude\\", in that it allowed him to live as the ordinary person he saw himself as and leave the world-famous superhero behind. This concept was often invoked in later stories, and one story featured Superman hiding his secret identity from a telepath behind a door identical to that of the pre-Crisis Fortress. By that time, however, a more physical Fortress had been reintroduced. In Action Comics Annual #2 (1989), Superman, on a self-imposed exile to space, was entrusted with a Kryptonian artifact called the Eradicator, created by his ancestor Kem-El. Dedicated to preserving Krypton, this device built a new Fortress in the Antarctic as a precursor to recreating Krypton on Earth. Superman broke the Eradicator's control, but maintained the Fortress as a useful location for emergencies. The first appearance of this new post-Crisis version of the Fortress was in Adventures of Superman #461 (Dec. 1989). It contained many artifacts from the post-Crisis version of Krypton, most notably a number of robot servitors (one of whom, Kelex, became a trusted confidant) and a battlesuit from the Third Age of Krypton. Superman in the Fortress of Solitude on the variant cover of Action Comics #977 (June 2017). Art by Gary Frank. This Fortress was cast into the Phantom Zone as a result of a battle between Superman, Lex Luthor, and Dominus, a villain who played with Superman's mind and who was also trapped in the Phantom Zone. It did, however, serve as the template for the next Fortress, built by Steel, which was an extradimensional space accessed through a vast puzzle-globe. The now-mobile Fortress was relocated somewhere in the Andes. In the DC One Million series (1998), Superman's Fortress of Solitude in the 853rd Century resides within a tesseract located at the center of Earth's sun. By this time, Superman has lived in self-imposed exile within the Fortress for over 15,000 years. During the \\"For Tomorrow\\" story arc in 2004‚Äì05 Superman comics, Wonder Woman breached the Fortress in an attempt to confront Superman, causing the Fortress to self-destruct. Superman subsequently established a new Fortress in an ancient temple on a remote village in the Cordillera del C√≥ndor Mountains, on the border of Ecuador and Peru. This version of the Fortress is visually similar to the earliest \\"Secret Citadel\\" from Superman #17. The final version of the post-Crisis Fortress was home to Krypto and his dog-sitter Ned (the last remaining Superman robot), and contained a version of Kandor, a portal to the Phantom Zone, Kryptonian and alien artifacts, and holographic images of Jor-El and Lara. The caretaker of the Fortress was Kelex, a Kryptonian robot that was a descendant of the Kelex robot that served Jor-El. === Infinite Crisis === In the 2006 limited series Infinite Crisis, several survivors of the pre-Crisis multiverse ‚Äì the Earth- Two Superman, Lois Lane of Earth-Two, the Earth-Prime Superboy, and Earth- Three's Alexander Luthor, Jr. ‚Äì set up a base in the ruins of the Antarctic Fortress following their escape from the \\"paradise dimension\\" they had been trapped in since the end of Crisis on Infinite Earths. It was then revealed from Power Girl's repressed memories from her life on Earth-Two that her cousin Kal-L had his own version of the Fortress of Solitude similar to his Earth-One counterpart's Fortress. === \\"One Year Later\\" === In the 2006 story arc \\"Up, Up, and Away!\\", Superman recovered a piece of Kryptonian sunstone, which Lex Luthor had used to awaken an ancient Kryptonian warship. Superman learned that the sunstone had been sent with him from Krypton, and used it to construct a new Fortress in the Arctic in exactly the same manner as in the 1978 Superman film. He nevertheless plans to restore the Peruvian Fortress, even if compromised and no longer in a secret location, and plans more Fortresses around the world. This version of the Fortress physically resembles the movie and television depictions, and Superman communicates with Jor-El via crystal constructs as in the Superman film and Smallville. === The New 52 === The New 52 Fortress of Solitude In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the Fortress of Solitude is first seen floating in space. It is later revealed to be the orbiting ship of Braniac which Superman had taken over after he physically reprogrammed the Collector of Worlds. This fortress is reported destroyed in the five years between the current Action Comics arc, and the New 52 present day,supergirl #12 with the current fortress once more in the Arctic.Action Comics #14 In the New 52, Supergirl also has her own fortress, known as Sanctuary, and located in the depths of the ocean. This fortress first appears in Supergirl #12 with its purpose explained in Supergirl #13. In Action Comics #15, Superman is revealed to have a fortress which he refers to as his \\"Yucatan base\\", a reference to his fortress in the Amazon rain forest in previous continuity. Following the discovery of Superman's \\"Super Flare\\", Kal-El made his way to the Fortress via a stolen motorcycle due to burning out his powers. When trying access the Fortress, the A.I. was unable to recognize Kal-El due to his DNA changing and forcibly removed his Kryptonian armor. It was revealed months later Vandal Savage was the person responsible for altering Superman's DNA in order to draw Kal-El away from the Fortress. Savage later converged all of his forces on the Fortress itself and transported it to Metropolis. However, Superman was able to find a temporary 'cure' for his power loss by exposing himself to kryptonite as a form of 'chemotherapy' that burned away the radiation preventing his cells from absorbing energy. On the verge of death while trying to stop Savage, he is caught by the arm and shot in the lower abdomen. As he fell from the sky believing he was about to die, the kryptonite had finished burning away the radiation. The Fortress scanned Superman, confirmed that he is Kal-El, activated and opened up, caught Superman, restored his powers to their peak and returned his Kryptonian armor to him. After defeating Vandal Savage and his children, Superman moves the Fortress back to the arctic circle. Several days after the crisis Superman uses the Fortress's medical equipment and A.I technology to do a full physical on him and discovers that as a result of Vandal's actions using Krytonite to burn out his infected cells that he is dying and has mere weeks to live. Following Superman's death, the Pre-New 52 Superman was able to gain access to the Fortress as both he and the deceased Superman share identical DNA, even though they are from separate timelines. Superman takes his deceased counterpart to the Fortress hoping to use the Regeneration Matrix to revive him, as the Eradicator did to him in his native timeline. However, in the New 52 universe of Prime Earth, no such technology exists. After burying his counterpart in Smallville he returns to the Fortress and uses his heat vision to create a statue of Superman of Prime Earth to honor his fallen comrade. The Eradicator of Pre-New 52 eventually arrives on Prime Earth and takes up residence within the Fortress. == Other versions == === All-Star Superman === In the out-of-continuity series All-Star Superman, the Fortress is once again located in the Arctic. Superman has replaced the giant key with a normal-sized key which is made from super-dense dwarf star material and weighs half a million tons, restricting its use to those with immense superhuman strength. It has a team of robots working on various projects. The Fortress itself contains the Titanic, the space shuttle Columbia, and a baby Sun-Eater, as well as larger-than-life memorabilia, similar to the objects found in the Batcave. It has various scientific facilities as well, including a time telescope that can receive brief cryptic messages with reception of limited quality from the future.Morrison, Grant. All-Star Superman #2 (Feb 2006), DC Comics === Earth One === In Superman: Earth One graphic novel series, the Fortress of Solitude was built by Superman's Krytonian ship's AI, using the Arctic's cave system. == Other media == === Television === ==== Animation ====  Super Friends  The Fortress has several appearances in the Super Friends animated series. The Super Friends version of the Fortress of Solitude is said to be located \\"in a deserted region of the frozen Arctic\\". In the episode \\"Terror at 20,000 Fathoms\\", Superman gives Aquaman, the Wonder Twins and Gleek a guided tour of the Fortress showing off many structures such as the Bottle City of Kandor. In a 1980 episode titled \\"Journey into Blackness\\", which said the Fortress was located \\"in a frozen and desolate area of the North Pole\\", Superman spots a black hole headed towards Earth using a telescope in the Fortress. In a 1980 episode titled \\"Revenge of Bizarro\\", Superman goes his Fortress of Solitude to stop Bizarro and return the Bizarro Super Friends back to normal with an Anti- Bizarro ray. A 1981 episode titled \\"Evil From Krypton\\" depicted the Fortress with a somewhat crystalline exterior and without the giant key, reminiscent of its film appearances. In a 1986 episode titled \\"The Death of Superman\\", the Fortress more closely resembles the pre-Crisis comic-book version, including a giant yellow key whose use required the combined efforts of Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Cyborg.  DC animated universe  Superman: The Animated Series and Justice League Unlimited present a slightly altered version, with the Fortress located in the ocean underneath the Arctic tundra; access was gained by diving into the Arctic water and emerging in an opening inside the Fortress. This version contained an alien zoo housing alien life- forms saved from the Preserver's ship and some computer equipment, along with a Brainiac information sphere stolen from his hijacked spacecraft just before it was destroyed, which is used by Superman to access information about Krypton. The fortress also contains massive sculptures of Superman's biological parents, Jor-El and Lara, serving as monuments to Krypton. The Fortress of Solitude is also a major setting for the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"For the Man Who Has Everything\\". A fight with the warlord Mongul took place there, after he delivered a parasite capable of hypnosis to Superman and was detected by Batman and Wonder Woman. In this version, the name \\"Fortress of Solitude\\" was given by Professor Emil Hamilton in a sarcastically humorous remark while he visited the Fortress in one episode. In the future of Batman Beyond, a Starro from the Fortress' intergalactic zoo is revealed to have latched on to Superman years prior and subtly controlled his actions since then, including allowing an entire population of the creatures to breed in one of the aquatic chambers. The Justice League of the future travels to the Fortress where they are themselves taken over by Starros, until Batman is able to free Superman and the rest of the League from their control. The League then sends the Starro population through a boom tube back to the world where the original Starro came from.  Legion of Super Heroes  The Fortress also appears in the Legion of Super Heroes animated series. It appears in the episode called \\"Message in a Bottle\\". In that episode, the Legion chase Imperiex to the Fortress, where he shrinks himself to enter Kandor, to steal highly advanced ancient Kryptonian technology invented by Jor-El.  Young Justice  In the Young Justice episode \\"Failsafe\\", the Fortress of Solitude appears on Robin's satellite imagery as a location that was being investigated by alien invaders.  Justice League Action  In Justice League Action episode \\"Field Trip\\", Superman gives Blue Beetle, Firestorm, and Stargirl a tour of the Fortress of Solitude. ==== Live-action ====  Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman  On Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, the \\"Fortress\\" was conspicuously absent, presumably because the series' aim was to explore the idea of Clark Kent being the true identity and Superman merely being the disguise (therefore, the character would have no use for an otherworldly fortress). In the earlier issues of the John Byrne revamp of Superman, the Fortress was also absent so the show was probably following suit. In the tradition of this approach, the Fortress of Solitude was the name of Clark Kent's childhood treehouse in season one episode \\"The Foundling\\".  Smallville  In Smallville, Jonathan Kent once referred to the loft space in the Kent farm's barn as the \\"Fortress of Solitude\\" since it was the place where the teenage Clark Kent usually preferred to be alone. In season 4's finale \\"Commencement\\", After Clark had united all of the Stones of Power (Air, Water, Fire) they created a super crystal, the \\"Crystal of Knowledge\\". Once he grabbed the crystal it transported him to an opening in the Arctic Circle where he threw the crystal into the snow thus creating the Fortress of Solitude. The fifth season premiere episode, Arrival, fully introduces a Fortress of Solitude that is almost identical, both in appearance and construction by self-replicating crystals, to that depicted in the original Superman movies. During the episode, Clark carries an injured Chloe Sullivan from the Fortress to a hospital in the Yukon, suggesting this is one of the nearest inhabited/medically proficient locations to the structure. An artificial intelligence built into the Fortress by Clark's biological father, Jor-El, would provide Clark with various 'Trials' throughout the series to help steer him toward his destiny as a symbol of hope for humanity. The Jor-El A.I. was, for the most part, omniscient, with the ability to send characters through time, open portals to alternate dimensions, and remove, restore and also transfer Clark's powers to other characters, seemingly at will. In later seasons, the Fortress is exposed as being vulnerable to other Kryptonian technology ‚Äì namely Brainiac, and the Orb of Kandor. Lex Luthor would later use the Orb to revert the Fortress back into its original, handheld crystal form after becoming obsessed with Kryptonian conspiracy theories, and mistaking the structure for an alien invasion base. Lex also uses the orb to locate the fortress. The orb levitates and constructs a 3D globe of the world and isolates a circular section of Greenland. When the crystal was later recovered by Lex's sister, Tess Mercer, as she searched for the now deceased Lex in Northern Greenland, Clark successfully rebuilt the Fortress to resume his training with Jor-El as well as to remove Brainiac from Chloe Sullivan. After completing this Jor-El told Kal-El that he was proud of him and will help in his fight with Doomsday. After Clark leaves Brainiac who has been hiding within the crystal console in his liquid form takes over the Fortress and changes the entire building black and produces the symbol for \\"Doom\\" on the floor. Chloe is then brought back to the Fortress after Doomsday crashed her and Jimmy's wedding where Brainiac downloads himself into Chloe leaving the Fortress itself and began to physically download all the knowledge into himself via Chloe. Brainiac then places Davis Bloom, Doomsday's human form in a Kryptonian chamber where it will take days to permanently transform him into Doomsday. After Brainiac was defeated by Clark and the Legion of Super Hero's Brainiac's connection to the Fortress was terminated and all the knowledge he stole returned as well as the Fortress turning back white. A few months after Jimmy was killed Clark was able to repair the Fortress and his connection to Jor-El to resume his Kryptonian training. Although fully repaired there were still a number crystallized pillars that were still black after Brainiac was defeated. However, it was discovered that the Fortress was repairing itself and by the following year, after Clark defeated Zod, all the black crystal pillars were destroyed with Fortress of Solitude fully repaired and purged of corruption ready to serve Clark in his quest to become Superman. During the series' tenth and final season, the Fortress became home to a Martha Kent- crafted, classic Superman costume, which Clark would go on to don in the final episode. Rather than being specifically made for the production, the costume was originally designed and created for Brandon Routh to wear in Superman Returns. The Fortress is also referred to as Jor-El's 'Fortress of Knowledge' by his assistant Raya.  Supergirl  The Fortress appears in the Supergirl episode \\"Solitude\\". As in the comics, it is opened with a massive dwarf star matter key (about long and thick) and appears to be built from either crystal or ice. It contains Kal-El's spaceship, his parents' statue, a Legion Flight Ring and at least one robotic servant called Kelex. Superman had invited Kara there a number of times, but she always refused, afraid of being overcome by nostalgia. It is also mentioned by Kara's sister Alex Danvers that Kara's cousin uses the fortress as a base where he can communicate with his Kryptonian ancestors. Kara finally goes there with James Olsen to look for information about Indigo. In \\"Myriad\\", Kara visits the fortress seeking out Kal-El's whereabouts and the purpose of program Myriad. When Kelex refuses to give information to her, the fortress triggered a hologram of her mother of which she explained to her about Myriad's programming. In \\"The Last Children of Krypton\\", Superman and J'onn J'onzz visit this place to find information about Metallo. In the episode \\"The Darkest Place\\", Hank Henshaw/Cyborg Superman gains access to the Fortress and uses Kara's blood which Cadmus drained from her in order to access the Fortress's archive for information on Project Medusa. In \\"Medusa\\", Kara went to the Fortress to find information on Project Medusa and was told everything regarding the project by a hologram of her father. In \\"Mr. & Mrs. Mxyzptlk\\", Kara lures Mxyzptlk in fortress in order to trick him with a false self-destruct sequence and make him to type the abort code which happened to be his name backwards to force him to go back in his dimension. In \\"Distant Sun\\", Mon-El and Kara decide to talk to his mother Rhea in fortress about calling off the bounty on Supergirl's head. She refused and attacked Supergirl with kryptonite daggers, nearly killing her. Mon-El interrupted and decided to go with his mother to save Kara's life. In \\"Resist\\", during Daxamite invasion on Earth, Cadmus and DEO propose an alliance to stop invaders and save Lena Luthor and Mon-El from Rhea. Kara, Lilian Luthor and Hank Henshaw enter the Fortress to activate the Phantom Zone projector to board into Daxamite ship. After saving them, only Lena, her mother and Hank return to Fortress where Lilian betrayed Kara and Mon-El to leave them behind. However, Kara expected her betrayal and her friend Winn Schott Jr. put a bug device on Henshaw prior to rescue operation as a precaution. She activated the device to force him in reactivating the projector to beam Mon-El out of the spaceship, while staying behind to confront Rhea. In \\"Nevertheless, She Persisted\\" Kara and Kal-El are taken to Fortress by Alex to be healed after their brutal fight when Superman was poisoned with silver kryptonite by Rhea, hallucinating and thinking that he was fighting against General Zod. Kal-El then enters database to find a way to stop Daxamite war and finds it in the form of fighting ritual called Dakkar- Ur.  Krypton  The Fortress of Solitude is central to the storyline of Krypton. Seg-El, Kal-El's grandfather, visits the Fortress with his mother, Charys-El, to find the lost research of Val-El, Seg-El's grandfather, after Adam Strange requests Seg-El to find the Fortress to stop Brainiac from destroying Krypton and altering the timeline to prevent Kal-El's birth, 200 years later. Meanwhile, Nyssa-Vex and Jayna-Zod are trying to find the Fortress to prevent information about life on other planets from getting out to the public. === Film === ====Original film series (1978-2006)==== In Superman and its sequels (except for Superman III, in which it did not appear), the Fortress is created by a crystal that Jor-El enclosed in Kal-El's spaceship. The crystal leads teenage Clark Kent to an ice field where it is \\"planted\\" by Clark, after which it melts into the ice and grows into a huge crystalline building, similar to the crystalline architecture shown on Krypton at the beginning of the film. This fortress was also used to start Kal-El's 12-year training to become Superman. This Fortress contains numerous \\"memory crystals\\" that can be used to access Jor-El's artificial intelligence and hologram, interactive holographic recordings of Lara, and other Kryptonians, and a chamber that uses red sun radiation to strip Kryptonians of their super powers. In Richard Donner's cut of Superman II, the Fortress is destroyed by Superman as its existence was revealed to Lex Luthor and his henchwoman, Eve Teschmacher. However, Superman then turns back time (√† la 1978's Superman), so technically the Fortress is completely undamaged, while Zod, Ursa and Non are returned to the Phantom Zone. Superman Returns (2006) concept art In Superman Returns, the Fortress follows the same formula as the earlier movies, but goes into more detail about the crystal origins of the Fortress and Kryptonian architecture. Lex Luthor attempts to use memory crystals he stole from it to create a new land mass in place of America. An observation is made (following Superman II) that he acts as though he has been there before. The crystals that power the Fortress were lost when Lex Luthor's assistant dropped them out the escaping helicopter into the ocean below. The tie-in book, Superman Returns: The Visual Guide lists the Fortress as sitting on \\"Fletcher's Abyssal Plane\\". === Video games === In the video game The Death and Return of Superman for SNES, the Fortress of Solitude is shown in one of the cutscenes. The Fortress of Solitude is a location in Mortal Kombat vs. DC. Its appearance is based on the Donner-Singer films, but with some added visuals including ice statues of Jor El and Lara holding up Krypton, and a Jor El image behind a crystal. This same fortress design is shown in the DC Universe Online MMORPG, and is used by Batman and Lex Luthor as a last bastion against the forces of Brainiac. A similar design was used in Injustice: Gods Among Us. The Fortress of Solitude is featured in the Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham. == References == == External links == * Super Who's Who: The Fortress of Solitude Featuring the original Citadel, the 1949 Fortress, and the 1958 version * Supermanica: Fortress of Solitude Supermanica entry on the pre-Crisis Fortress of Solitude * Google Sketchup/Earth Model of the Fortress of Solitude * Supermanica: Secret Sanctuary Supermanica entry on the Secret Sanctuary * Comic Coverage: The Fortress at 50 * Superman's Fortress of Solitude, a short story by Rick Stoeckel Category:Fictional elements introduced in 1958 Category:Superman Category:Arctic in fiction Category:Alien zoos in fiction Solitude Category:Fictional museums Category:Fictional secret bases Category:DC Comics locations sv:St√•lmannen#Utrustning ","title":"Fortress of Solitude"},{"id":"845684","text":" The Bloch MB.130 and its derivatives were a series of French monoplane reconnaissance-bombers developed during the 1930s. They saw some limited action at the beginning of World War II but were obsolete by that time and suffered badly against the Luftwaffe. After the fall of France, a few were pressed into Luftwaffe service. ==Design and development== The MB.130 was developed in response to the August 1933 French Aviation Ministry request for a reconnaissance and tactical bomber. It was an all-metal, twin-engine, low- wing monoplane with retractable landing gear, and armed with three flexible machine guns, one each in the nose, dorsal turret, and ventral gondola. It first flew on 29 June 1934, and despite very ordinary performance, soon entered production, 40 machines being ordered in October 1935. An improved version, the MB.131 was first flown on 16 August 1936, but still needed more work to overcome its deficiencies. The radically revised second prototype which flew on 5 May 1937 eventually formed the basis for series production, with aircraft being manufactured by SNCASO, the nationalised company that had absorbed Bloch and Bl√©riot. Total production (including prototypes) was 143. ==MB.135== A four-engined derivative of the MB.134, was developed powered by four Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14M 14 cylinder radial engines, with an essentially similar airframe. The sole example flew for the first time on 12 January 1939. ==Operational history== Entering service in June 1938, the MB.131 went on to equip seven reconnaissance Groupes, six in metropolitan France and one in North Africa. Upon the outbreak of the war, the metropolitan Groupes suffered heavy losses in attempts at daylight reconnaissance of Germany's western borders. They were subsequently restricted to flying night missions, though they still suffered heavy losses even then. By May 1940, all metropolitan units had been converted to Potez 63.11 aircraft, with only the African groupe retaining them for front-line duty. After the Battle of France, the planes left in Vichy possession were relegated to target towing duty. 21 planes were reported captured by the Luftwaffe in inoperable condition, but photographic evidence suggests at least a few flew for the Nazis. ==Variants== Bloch MB.130.01 photo from NACA-SR-26 Bloch MB.133 prototype ;MB.130.01 :Original prototype, 2x Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14Kdrs engines. ;MB.131.01 :First prototype, 2x Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14N-10. ;MB.131.02 :Second prototype with revised wings, tail, and fuselage ;MB.131R4 :Initial versions with one central machine gun, 13 built.

This is sometimes dropped. (, French for Yippee!) is the official mascot for the Montreal Canadiens, and former longtime mascot of Montreal Expos. Youppi! wears an exclamation mark as his jersey number. ==History== Youppi! as the Expos' mascot Youppi!, a creation of Acme Mascots, Inc. (a division of Harrison/Erickson, Inc.), was commissioned by Expos vice-president Roger D. Landry. Originally leased by the team in 1979, the mascot was eventually purchased by the Montreal Expos baseball team and represented them until they moved to Washington, D.C., after the 2004 season. Youppi! was designed by Bonnie Erickson, formerly a designer for Jim Henson, and the designer of Miss Piggy, Statler & Waldorf and other Muppet characters. The orange, hairy giant was one of the most popular figures among everyone at Olympic Stadium. ===Notoriety=== Youppi! was the first mascot to be thrown out of a Major League Baseball game: during the 1989 Expos season, on August 23 while atop the visitors' dugout in the 11th inning, Youppi! took a running leap, landing hard and noisily on its roof, and then sneaked into a front row seat. Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda complained to the umpiresmlb.com, 6 September 2019 and Youppi! was ejected by Bob Davidson, though he later returned, confined to the home team's dugout roof, as Montreal eventually lost 1‚Äì0 in 22 innings. Youppi! was also a frequent joke punchline of notoriously sarcastic Atlanta Braves broadcaster Skip Caray. Youppi! was also referenced by pitcher Bill Lee during interviews in Ken Burns's Baseball documentary. Youppi! is one of only three mascots featured as displays at the Baseball Hall of Fame. The others are the Phillie Phanatic of Philadelphia, another design, and the Famous Chicken from San Diego. The Montreal-based political cartoonist Terry Mosher, better known as \\"Aislin\\", depicted or referenced Youppi! on several occasions, including a prescient 1988 cartoon drawn at a time when the Expos were having a poor season and depicting then-general manager of the Canadiens Serge Savard receiving a phone call from Youppi!, presumably seeking employment.\\"Youppi Calls Serge Savard\\", McCord Museum Youppi! was voted to the Mascot Hall of Fame in December 2019, and was inducted in June 2020. Youppi! is the first mascot of a Canadian team to receive the honor. ===From baseball to hockey=== Youppi! as the Canadiens' mascot After the Expos moved to Washington, D.C. and became the Washington Nationals, the Nationals initially stated that Youppi! would still be a part of the team in some capacity. However, the team adopted a new mascot, the eagle \\"Screech\\". For months after the move, the fate of Youppi! hung in the balance. Negotiations were held with ten groups, including the Montreal Alouettes. On September 16, 2005, the Montreal Canadiens announced that Youppi! would become the first official mascot of the organization, and the first mascot to ever switch between any two major sports leagues in North America. The terms of acquisition were reportedly in the six figures. Youppi! now sports the Canadiens' bleu-blanc- rouge (blue, white, and red) jersey. Youppi!'s first game in the Bell Centre was on October 18, 2005. On February 19, 2012, at the Canadiens' first home game after the death of Montreal Expos great Gary Carter, Youppi! wore the Expos colours in Carter's memory. On May 16, 2014, on the eve of the Canadiens series against the New York Rangers in the 2014 Eastern Conference Finals, New York City native Jimmy Fallon, the host of NBC's Tonight Show, which is taped in New York, made a bet with the Montreal Canadiens that if they won the series, Fallon would wear a Montreal jersey during his opening monologue. However, if the Rangers won the series, Youppi! would have to wear a Rangers jersey around Montreal and post at least ten pictures of him doing so on the Canadiens' Twitter account and also change their avatar to a pic of Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist playing guitar. The Rangers won the series on May 29 in six games. As such, on June 1, the Canadiens honoured their bet and a dejected Youppi! was photographed around Montreal in a Rangers jersey with Fallon's name on the back, and the last photo, as Fallon stated, featured him riding the mechanical bull at Montreal bar Chez Serge.http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=721426#&navid;=nhl-search ==See also== * List of National Hockey League mascots * List of Major League Baseball mascots ==References== ==External links== *Official Youppi! website *Youppi Category:Major League Baseball team mascots Category:National Hockey League team mascots Category:Montreal Expos Category:Sport in Montreal Category:Montreal Canadiens Category:Mascots introduced in 1979 Category:Canadian mascots ","title":"Youppi!"},{"id":"845688","text":"Pombe may refer to: * Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the fission yeast, a yeast species used as a model organism in molecular and cell biology * Pombe beer, a type of locally made African millet beer ","title":"Pombe"},{"id":"845697","text":"Sa Goj≈ç (Ê≤ôÊÇüÂáà) (occasionally Sha Goj≈ç) can refer to various characters based on Sha Wujing, such as: * The Japanese name of the Journey to the West character Sha Wujing * The character \\"Sandy\\" in the Monkey TV series * Sha Gojyo (Saiyuki), in the manga Saiyuki ","title":"Sa Goj≈ç"},{"id":"845699","text":"Senator Margaret SmithThe Declaration of Conscience was a Cold War speech made by U.S. Senator from Maine, Margaret Chase Smith on June 1, 1950, less than four months after Senator Joe McCarthy's \\"Wheeling Speech,\\" on February 9, 1950. Her speech was endorsed by six other liberal-to-moderate Republicans. In it, she criticized national leadership and called for the country, the United States Senate, and the Republican Party to re-examine the tactics used by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and (without naming him) Senator Joe McCarthy. She stated the basic principles of \\"Americanism\\" were: *The right to criticize; *The right to hold unpopular beliefs; *The right to protest; *The right of independent thought. Smith voiced concern that those who exercised those beliefs at that time risked unfairly being labeled communist or fascist. In the Declaration of Conscience, Smith said, > The Democratic administration has greatly lost the confidence of the > American people by its complacency to the threat of communism and the leak > of vital secrets to Russia through key officials of the Democratic > administration. There are enough proved cases to make this point without > diluting our criticism with unproved charges.

The other Senators who signed onto the Declaration were Wayne Morse of Oregon, George Aiken of Vermont, Edward Thye of Minnesota, Irving Ives of New York, Charles Tobey of New Hampshire, and Robert C. Hendrickson of New Jersey. While the initial reception was chilly, the full-fledged outbreak of the Korean War on June 25, 1950 had made it unlikely that Smith's views would prevail. The only signatory whose outrage remained undimmed was Wayne Morse, who eventually left the party, first becoming an independent, then a Democrat. Bernard Baruch stated that if a man had given the Declaration speech \\"he would be the next President.\\" The speech was listed as #41 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank).

This engine uses continuously variable timing for the inlet valves In internal combustion engines, variable valve timing (VVT) is the process of altering the timing of a valve lift event, and is often used to improve performance, fuel economy or emissions. It is increasingly being used in combination with variable valve lift systems. There are many ways in which this can be achieved, ranging from mechanical devices to electro-hydraulic and camless systems. Increasingly strict emissions regulations are causing many automotive manufacturers to use VVT systems. Two-stroke engines use a power valve system to get similar results to VVT. ==Background theory== The valves within an internal combustion engine are used to control the flow of the intake and exhaust gases into and out of the combustion chamber. The timing, duration and lift of these valve events has a significant impact on engine performance. Without variable valve timing or variable valve lift, the valve timing is the same for all engine speeds and conditions, therefore compromises are necessary.Wu, B. (2007). A simulation-based approach for developing optimal calibrations for engines with variable valve actuation. Oil and Gas Science and Technology, 62(4), 539‚Äì553. An engine equipped with a variable valve timing actuation system is freed from this constraint, allowing performance to be improved over the engine operating range. Piston engines normally use valves which are driven by camshafts. The cams open (lift) the valves for a certain amount of time (duration) during each intake and exhaust cycle. The timing of the valve opening and closing, relative to the position of the crankshaft, is important. The camshaft is driven by the crankshaft through timing belts, gears or chains. An engine requires large amounts of air when operating at high speeds. However, the intake valves may close before enough air has entered each combustion chamber, reducing performance. On the other hand, if the camshaft keeps the valves open for longer periods of time, as with a racing cam, problems start to occur at the lower engine speeds. Opening the intake valve while the exhaust valve is still open may cause unburnt fuel to exit the engine, leading to lower engine performance and increased emissions. ===Continuous versus discrete=== Early variable valve timing systems used discrete (stepped) adjustment. For example, one timing would be used below 3500 rpm and another used above 3500 rpm. More advanced \\"continuous variable valve timing\\" systems offer continuous (infinite) adjustment of the valve timing. Therefore, the timing can be optimized to suit all engine speeds and conditions.Hong, H. (2004). Review and analysis of variable valve timing strategies - eight ways to approach. Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part D: Journal of Automobile Engineering, 218(10), 1179‚Äì1200. ===Cam phasing versus variable duration=== The simplest form of VVT is cam-phasing, whereby the phase angle of the camshaft is rotated forwards or backwards relative to the crankshaft. Thus the valves open and close earlier or later; however, the camshaft lift and duration cannot be altered solely with a cam-phasing system. Achieving variable duration on a VVT system requires a more complex system, such as multiple cam profiles or oscillating cams. ==Typical effect of timing adjustments== Late intake valve closing (LIVC) The first variation of continuous variable valve timing involves holding the intake valve open slightly longer than a traditional engine. This results in the piston actually pushing air out of the cylinder and back into the intake manifold during the compression stroke. The air which is expelled fills the manifold with higher pressure, and on subsequent intake strokes the air which is taken in is at a higher pressure. Late intake valve closing has been shown to reduce pumping losses by 40% during partial load conditions, and to decrease nitric oxide (NOx) emissions by 24%. Peak engine torque showed only a 1% decline, and hydrocarbon emissions were unchanged. Early intake valve closing (EIVC) Another way to decrease the pumping losses associated with low engine speed, high vacuum conditions is by closing the intake valve earlier than normal. This involves closing the intake valve midway through the intake stroke. Air/fuel demands are so low at low-load conditions and the work required to fill the cylinder is relatively high, so Early intake valve closing greatly reduces pumping losses. Studies have shown early intake valve closing reduces pumping losses by 40%, and increases fuel economy by 7%. It also reduced nitric oxide emissions by 24% at partial load conditions. A possible downside to early intake valve closing is that it significantly lowers the temperature of the combustion chamber, which can increase hydrocarbon emissions. Early intake valve opening Early intake valve opening is another variation that has significant potential to reduce emissions. In a traditional engine, a process called valve overlap is used to aid in controlling the cylinder temperature. By opening the intake valve early, some of the inert/combusted exhaust gas will back flow out of the cylinder, via the intake valve, where it cools momentarily in the intake manifold. This inert gas then fills the cylinder in the subsequent intake stroke, which aids in controlling the temperature of the cylinder and nitric oxide emissions. It also improves volumetric efficiency, because there is less exhaust gas to be expelled on the exhaust stroke. Early/late exhaust valve closing Early and late exhaust valve closing timing can be manipulated to reduce emissions. Traditionally, the exhaust valve opens, and exhaust gas is pushed out of the cylinder and into the exhaust manifold by the piston as it travels upward. By manipulating the timing of the exhaust valve, engineers can control how much exhaust gas is left in the cylinder. By holding the exhaust valve open slightly longer, the cylinder is emptied more and ready to be filled with a bigger air/fuel charge on the intake stroke. By closing the valve slightly early, more exhaust gas remains in the cylinder which increases fuel efficiency. This allows for more efficient operation under all conditions. ==Challenges== The main factor preventing this technology from wide use in production automobiles is the ability to produce a cost-effective means of controlling the valve timing under the conditions internal to an engine. An engine operating at 3000 revolutions per minute will rotate the camshaft 25 times per second, so the valve timing events have to occur at precise times to offer performance benefits. Electromagnetic and pneumatic camless valve actuators offer the greatest control of precise valve timing, but, in 2016, are not cost-effective for production vehicles. ==History== ===Steam engines=== The history of the search for a method of variable valve opening duration goes back to the age of steam engines when the valve opening duration was referred to as \\"steam cut- off‚Äù. The Stephenson valve gear, as used on early steam locomotives, supported variable cutoff, that is, changes to the time at which the admission of steam to the cylinders is cut off during the power stroke. Early approaches to variable cutoff coupled variations in admission cutoff with variations in exhaust cutoff. Admission and exhaust cutoff were decoupled with the development of the Corliss valve. These were widely used in constant speed variable load stationary engines, with admission cutoff, and therefore torque, mechanically controlled by a centrifugal governor and trip valves. As poppet valves came into use, a simplified valve gear using a camshaft came into use. With such engines, variable cutoff could be achieved with variable profile cams that were shifted along the camshaft by the governor. The Serpollet steamcars produced very hot high pressure steam, requiring poppet valves, and these used a patented sliding camshaft mechanism, which not only varied the inlet valve cut-off but allowed the engine to be reversed.Improvements in Valve Gear for Single-Acting Steam Engines, UK Patent 190005128, 1900, ===Aircraft=== An early experimental 200 hp Clerget V-8 from the 1910s used a sliding camshaft to change the valve timing. Some versions of the Bristol Jupiter radial engine of the early 1920s incorporated variable valve timing gear, mainly to vary the inlet valve timing in connection with higher compression ratios. The Lycoming R-7755 engine had a Variable Valve Timing system consisting of two cams that can be selected by the pilot. One for take off, pursuit and escape, the other for economical cruising. ===Automotive=== The desirability of being able to vary the valve opening duration to match an engine's rotational speed first became apparent in the 1920s when maximum allowable RPM limits were generally starting to rise. Until about this time an engine's idle RPM and its operating RPM were very similar, meaning that there was little need for variable valve duration. Some time prior to 1919 Lawrence Pomeroy, Vauxhall's Chief Designer, had designed a 4.4 L engine for a proposed replacement for the existing 30-98 model to be called the H-Type. In this engine the single overhead camshaft was to move longitudinally to allow different camshaft lobes to be engaged. It was in the 1920s that the first patents for variable duration valve opening started appearing ‚Äì for example United States patent . In 1958 Porsche made application for a German Patent, also applied for and published as British Patent GB861369 in 1959. The Porsche patent used an oscillating cam to increase the valve lift and duration. The desmodromic cam driven via a push/pull rod from an eccentric shaft or swashplate. It is unknown if any working prototype was ever made. Fiat was the first auto manufacturer to patent a functional automotive variable valve timing system which included variable lift. Developed by Giovanni Torazza in the late 1960s, the system used hydraulic pressure to vary the fulcrum of the cam followers (US Patent 3,641,988). The hydraulic pressure changed according to engine speed and intake pressure. The typical opening variation was 37%. Alfa Romeo was the first manufacturer to use a variable valve timing system in production cars (US Patent 4,231,330). The fuel injected models of the 1980 Alfa Romeo Spider 2000 had a mechanical VVT system. The system was engineered by Ing Giampaolo Garcea in the 1970s. All Alfa Romeo Spider models from 1983 onward used electronic VVT. In 1989, Honda released the VTEC system.asia.vtec.net While the earlier Nissan NVCS alters the phasing of the camshaft, VTEC switches to a separate cam profile at high engine speeds to improve peak power. The first VTEC engine Honda produced was the B16A which was installed in the Integra, CRX, and Civic hatchback available in Japan and Europe. In 1992, Porsche first introduced VarioCam, which was the first system to provide continuous adjustment (all previous systems used discrete adjustment). The system was released in the Porsche 968 and operated on the intake valves only. ====Motorcycles==== Variable valve timing has been applied to motorcycle engines but was considered a non-useful \\"technological showpiece\\" as late as 2004 due to the system's weight penalty. Since then, motorcycles including VVT have included the Kawasaki 1400GTR/Concours 14 (2007), the Ducati Multistrada 1200 (2015), the BMW R1250GS (2019) and the Yamaha YZF-R15 V3.0 (2017). ===Marine=== Variable valve timing has begun to trickle down to marine engines. Volvo Penta's VVT marine engine uses a cam phaser, controlled by the ECM, continuously varies advance or retardation of camshaft timing. ===Diesel=== In 2007, Caterpillar developed the C13 and C15 Acert engines which used VVT technology to reduce NOx emissions, to avoid the use of EGR after 2002 EPA requirements.Medium/Heavy Duty Truck Engines, Fuel & Computerized Management Systems In 2010, Mitsubishi developed and started mass production of its 4N13 1.8 L DOHC I4, the world's first passenger car diesel engine that features a variable valve timing system.\\"Geneva 2010: Mitsubishi ASX (Outlander Sport) Debuts in Geneva\\", autoguide.comMitsubishi Motors UK Geneva motor show 2010 presskit ==Automotive nomenclature== Hyundai T-GDI engine Manufacturers use many different names to describe their implementation of the various types of variable valve timing systems. These names include: *AVCS (Subaru) *AVLS (Subaru) *CPS (Proton) but proton use vvt engine for their new model of 2016 *CVTCS (Nissan, Infiniti) *CVVT ( developed by Hyundai motor Co., Kia, but it can also be founded on Geely, Iran Khodro, Volvo) *DCVCP - dual continuous variable cam phasing (General Motors) *DVT (Desmodromic variable timing, Ducati) *DVVT (Daihatsu, Perodua, Wuling) *MIVEC (Mitsubishi) *MultiAir (FCA) *N-VCT (Nissan) *S-VT (Mazda) *Ti-VCT (Ford) *VANOS (BMW) *Variatore di fase Alfa Romeo(VCT)Phase variator Alfa Romeo is a valve timing variation system designed by Alfa Romeo, the first used in a series production car(ALFA ROMEO spider duetto 1980) *VarioCam (Porsche) *VTEC, i-VTEC (Honda, Acura) *VTi, (Citroen, Peugeot, BMW group) *VVC (MG Rover) *VVL (Nissan) *Valvelift (Audi) *VVA (Yamaha) *VVEL (Nissan, Infiniti) *VVT (Chrysler, General Motors, Proton, Suzuki, Maruti, Isuzu, Volkswagen Group, Toyota) *VVT-i, VVTL-i (Toyota, Lexus) *VTVT (Hyundai) ==Methods for implementing variable valve control (VVC)== ===Cam switching=== This method uses two cam profiles, with an actuator to swap between the profiles (usually at a specific engine speed). Cam switching can also provide variable valve lift and variable duration, however the adjustment is discrete rather than continuous. The first production use of this system was Honda's VTEC system. VTEC changes hydraulic pressure to actuate a pin that locks the high lift, high duration rocker arm to an adjacent low lift, low duration rocker arm(s). ===Cam phasing=== Many production VVT systems are the cam phasing type, using a device known as a variator. This allows continuous adjustment of the cam timing (although many early systems only used discrete adjustment), however the duration and lift cannot be adjusted. ===Oscillating cam=== These designs use an oscillating or rocking motion in a part cam lobe, which acts on a follower. This follower then opens and closes the valve. Some oscillating cam systems use a conventional cam lobe, while others use an eccentric cam lobe and a connecting rod. The principle is similar to steam engines, where the amount of steam entering the cylinder was regulated by the steam \\"cut-off\\" point. The advantage of this design is that adjustment of lift and duration is continuous. However, in these systems, lift is proportional to duration, so lift and duration cannot be separately adjusted. The BMW (valvetronic), Nissan (VVEL), and Toyota (valvematic) oscillating cam systems act on the intake valves only. ===Eccentric cam drive=== Eccentric cam drive systems operates through an eccentric disc mechanism which slows and speeds up the angular speed of the cam lobe during its rotation. Arranging the lobe to slow during its open period is equivalent to lengthening its duration. The advantage of this system is that duration can be varied independent of lift (however this system does not vary lift). The drawback is two eccentric drives and controllers are needed for each cylinder (one for the intake valves and one for the exhaust valves), which increases complexity and cost. MG Rover is the only manufacturer that has released engines using this system. ===Three- dimensional cam lobe=== This system consists of a cam lobe that varies along its lengthhowstuffworks.com (similar to a cone shape). One end of the cam lobe has a short duration/reduced lift profile, and the other end has a longer duration/greater lift profile. In between, the lobe provides a smooth transition between these two profiles. By shifting area of the cam lobe which is in contact with the follower, the lift and duration can be continuously altered. This is achieved by moving the camshaft axially (sliding it across the engine) so a stationary follower is exposed to a varying lobe profile to produce different amounts of lift and duration. The downside to this arrangement is that the cam and follower profiles must be carefully designed to minimise contact stress (due to the varying profile). Ferrari is commonly associated with this system, however it is unknown whether any production models to date have used this system. ===Two shaft combined cam lobe profile=== This system is not known to be used in any production engines. It consists of two (closely spaced) parallel camshafts, with a pivoting follower that spans both camshafts and is acted on by two lobes simultaneously. Each camshaft has a phasing mechanism which allows its angular position relative to the engine's crankshaft to be adjusted. One lobe controls the opening of a valve and the other controls the closing of the same valve, therefore variable duration is achieved through the spacing of these two events. The drawbacks to this design include: *At long duration settings, one lobe may be starting to reduce its lift as the other is still increasing. This has the effect of lessening the overall lift and possibly causing dynamic problems. One company claims to have solved the uneven rate of opening of the valve problem to some extent thus allowing long duration at full lift. *Size of the system, due to the parallel shafts, the larger followers etc. ===Coaxial two shaft combined cam lobe profile=== This system is not known to be used in any production engines. The operating principle is that the one follower spans the pair of closely spaced lobes. Up to the angular limit of the nose radius the follower 'sees' the combined surface of the two lobes as a continuous, smooth surface. When the lobes are exactly aligned the duration is at a minimum (and equal to that of each lobe alone) and when at the extreme extent of their misalignment the duration is at a maximum. The basic limitation of the scheme is that only a duration variation equal to that of the lobe nose true radius (in camshaft degrees or double this value in crankshaft degrees) is possible. In practice this type of variable cam has a maximum range of duration variation of about forty crankshaft degrees. This is the principle behind what seems to be the very first variable cam suggestion appearing in the USPTO patent files in 1925 (1527456). The \\"Clemson camshaft\\" is of this type. ===Helical camshaft=== Also known as \\"combined two shaft coaxial combined profile with helical movement\\", this system is not known to be used in any production engines.\\"Performance Buildups\\" Magazine Vol.15 No.1 Pages 30‚Äì35 Author: Paul Tuzson\\"Two Wheels\\" Magazine July 2008 pages 74‚Äì75 Author Jeremy Bowdler\\"Fast Fours\\" Magazine July 2004 pages 100‚Äì108 Author: Paul Tuzson It has a similar principle to the previous type, and can use the same base duration lobe profile. However instead of rotation in a single plane, the adjustment is both axial and rotational giving a helical or three-dimensional aspect to its movement. This movement overcomes the restricted duration range in the previous type. The duration range is theoretically unlimited but typically would be of the order of one hundred crankshaft degrees, which is sufficient to cover most situations. The cam is reportedly difficult and expensive to produce, requiring very accurate helical machining and careful assembly. ===Camless engines=== Engine designs which do not rely on a camshaft to operate the valves have greater flexibility in achieving variable valve timing and variable valve lift. However, there has not been a production camless engine released for road vehicles as yet. ===Hydraulic system=== This system utilizes the engine lube oil to control the closure of inlet valve. The intake valve opening mechanism incorporates a valve tappet and a piston inside a chamber. There is a solenoid valve controlled by the engine control system which gets energized and supplies oil through a non-return valve during the time of cam lift and the oil gets filled in the chamber and the return channel to the sump is blocked by the valve tappet. During the downward movement of the cam, at a particular instant, the return passage opens and the oil pressure gets released to the engine sump. ==References== ==External links== *Honda Technology Picture Book, VTEC *Delphi Variable Cam Phasers (VCP) *Volvo CVVT article *MG Rover VVC article *MG Rover VVC article (from sandmuseum.com) *Mechadyne VVA systems Category:Engine valvetrain configurations Category:Motorcycle engines ","title":"Variable valve timing"},{"id":"845710","text":"The Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec (before 1998, the Federal Office of Regional Development - Quebec) is a Federal agency that has the responsibility of promoting economic expansion in Quebec by promoting small or medium-sized enterprises.

This knuckle curve is usually called the spike curve by MLB players and coaches because the pitch is nothing like a knuckleball. The second type of knuckle curve is a breaking ball that is thrown with a grip similar to the knuckleball. Unlike a knuckleball, which spins very little, a knuckle curve spins like a normal curveball because the pitcher's index and middle fingers push the top of the ball into a downward curve at the moment of release. Since only two fingers produce the spin, however, a knuckle curve does not spin as fast as a curveball, meaning the break is less sharp, and less predictable. Because this knuckle curve can be thrown with the same general motion as a fastball, it is more deceptive than a normal curveball. This kind of knuckle curve is rare‚Äîit is easier to control than a standard knuckleball, but still difficult to master. The most famous practitioners of this type of knuckle curve are Burt 'Happy' Hooton, who pitched for the Chicago Cubs and the Los Angeles Dodgers from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s, and former reliever Jason Isringhausen. The third type of knuckle curve was thrown by Dave Stenhouse in the 1960s. Stenhouse's knuckle curve was thrown like a fastball but with a knuckleball grip. Stenhouse discovered that this pitch had excellent movement, and when he came to the majors, he utilized it as a breaking pitch. This pitch may have been the same as the knuckleball thrown by Jesse Haines and Freddie Fitzsimmons. The pitch would be perfected by Chicago White Sox legend Hoyt Wilhelm during the later stages of his career, after flirting with it for most of his time in the majors. ==Notable knuckle curve pitchers== *Cody Allen *Matt Anderson *Dellin Betances *Shane Bieber *Archie Bradley *Mike Bolsinger * Walker Buehler *A.

Some producers take more of an executive role, in that they conceive new programs and pitch them to the television networks, but upon acceptance they focus on business matters, such as budgets and contracts. Other producers are more involved with the day-to-day workings, participating in activities such as screenwriting, set design, casting, and directing. There are a variety of different producers on a television show. A traditional producer is one who manages a show's budget and maintains a schedule, but this is no longer the case in modern television. ==Types of television producers== Different types of producers in the industry today include (in order of seniority): === Showrunner === : The showrunner is the \\"chief executive\\" in charge of everything related to the production of the show. It is the highest-ranking individual who is responsible for the production and daily management of the show. In fictional television, they supervise the writing room as well. === Executive producer === : Established show creators with prior writing credits are often given the title of executive producer, even after they depart the show. Executive producers can be showrunners, head writers, the head of a production company, or a long-time writer for the show. === Co-executive producer === : Near seniority to the executive producers, these producers serve as \\"chief operating officers\\" by managing above and below-the-line staff. In fictional shows, they have also contributed significantly in the writing room through table reads, discussions, and/or revisions. The co-executive producer may pen scripts as well. === Supervising producer === : In fictional shows, these producers assist in the creative process by engaging in table discussions, aiding in script rewrites, and also guiding new writers. In reality shows, they are often series directors who supervise other directors. === Producer === : In fictional shows, a producer may not have written the episode, but contributed significantly through table reads, discussions, and/or revisions. They may also be a former executive producer who still writes for the show, but has since relinquished his/her duties as E.P. Producers responsible for production logistics are given the credit of \\"produced by.\\" === Co-producer === : In fictional shows, a co-producer may not have written the episode, but contributed significantly through table reads, discussions, and/or revisions. === Coordinating producer === : The term is only used when the staff are working simultaneously on multiple shows. In such scenario, this producer coordinates their various tasks for them and places them into teams. === Consulting producer, executive consultant, or production consultant === : They consult certain aspects for the series. These producers are sometimes former executive producers or directors, who no longer work on the show, but are hired to consult for the production, nonetheless. They are usually called upon to assist the writers. : Many television series that have a large in-house writing staff will usually have a few writers given the title of consulting producer, despite their day-to-day presence being no different from that of any other writer on staff. In these cases, the deal made with that writer does not meet the rules required to give them one of the titles from co-producer to executive producer. Examples include the writer not being required to be in- office five days a week, the writer's services being non-exclusive, or the writer's pay quote being too high for the responsibilities a more defined producer title might entail. Consulting producers like these are still assigned script drafts to write along with the rest of the series writing staff. === Associate producer === : Serves any of the producer job functions at the request of the showrunner. === Assistant producer === : Sources contributors and stories for the reality program. === Chase producer === : For news and talk show production, locates and schedules (or \\"chases\\") guests for interviews. === Segment producer === : Writes one segment of a reality program. === Line producer === : In charge of the unit production manager, these producers find staff to employ and manage their pay checks. Most line producers receive the \\"produced by\\" title, as they tend to also be responsible for production logistics. === Field producer === : In reality shows only. Selects areas to film (outside of a television studio) and coordinates stories for a production in the field. They also form a trusting relationship with the cast/participants in order to get interviews while in the field. They may fill a number of different roles, including production manager/coordinator, videographer, and also production assistant. === Edit producer === : Helps co- ordinate the edit by working with the editor and relaying information from other producers. Involved in creating stories and writing the script if necessary. === Post-production producer or post-production coordinator === : Responsible for the overall post-production process, including editing, dubbing, and grading, and are managed by the post-production supervisor. In live television or \\"as-live\\", an executive producer seldom has any operational control of the show. His/her job is to stand back from the operational aspects and judge the show as an ordinary viewer might. In film or video productions, the executive producer is almost always given an opportunity to comment on a rough cut, but the amount of attention paid to his/her comments is highly dependent on the overall personnel structure of the production. ==Writer as \\"producer\\"== Because of the restrictions the Writers Guild of America screenwriting credit system places on writing credits, many script writers in television are credited as \\"producers\\" instead, even though they may not engage in the responsibilities generally associated with that title. On- screen, a \\"producer\\" credit for a TV series will generally be given to each member of the writing staff who made a demonstrable contribution to the final script. The actual producer of the show (in the traditional sense) is listed under the credit \\"produced by\\". Bill Lawrence, a television screenwriter, producer, director and series creator (Scrubs, Cougar Town and Spin City) explained during an interview on Off Camera that: ==Star as \\"producer\\"== Sometimes the star of a successful television series can have a degree of influence over the creative process. For example, besides his leading role as Jack Bauer in 24, Kiefer Sutherland was credited as producer during the show's second season, then rising to co-executive producer from season 3 to the last few episodes of season 5, from where he was finally promoted to executive producer. Claire Danes, the star of Homeland, also produces the show. Mark Harmon, star of the series NCIS, serves as one of the show's producers. Similarly, Tom Welling, the star of the CW show Smallville, became co- executive producer for the show in season 9 and executive producer in season 10. House star Hugh Laurie became co-executive producer for the show in its sixth season. Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano, the stars of Charmed, became producers of the show in its fifth season. Ellen Pompeo on Grey's Anatomy became a producer in season 14. ==Notable television producers== * J. J.

The majority of the modern states of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries are rational-legal authorities, according to those who use this form of classification. Scholars such as Max Weber and Charles Perrow characterized the rational-legal bureaucracy as the most efficient form of administration. ==Rational-legal authority== In sociology, the concept of rational-legal domination comes from Max Weber's tripartite classification of authority (one of several classifications of government used by sociologists); the other two forms being traditional authority and charismatic authority. All of those three domination types represent an example of his ideal type concept. Weber noted that in history those ideal types of domination are always found in combinations. In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the authority comes from tradition. Charismatic authority is legitimized by the personality and leadership qualities of the ruling individual. Finally, rational-legal authority derives its powers from the system of bureaucracy and legality. ==Legal rationality and legitimate authority == Under rational-legal authority, legitimacy is seen as coming from a legal order and the laws that have been enacted in it (see also natural law and legal positivism). Weber defined legal order as a system where the rules are enacted and obeyed as legitimate because they are in line with other laws on how they can be enacted and how they should be obeyed. Further, they are enforced by a government that monopolizes their enactment and the legitimate use of physical force. If society, as a whole, approves the exercise of the power in a certain way, then the power is considered \\"legitimate authority\\". == Max Weber's theory: type of authority == Max Weber broke down legitimate authority into three different types of societies: Traditional Authority, Rational-legal Authority, and Charismatic Authority. Each of these authorities have their own unique complex societies that have evolved from simple definitions. === 1.Traditional authority: traditional grounds === * Is the type of power that has been around longer, it is the type of power that is traditionally rooted in beliefs and the practices of society. This authority is liked by many individuals because of two main reasons: the inheritance of past generations and religiousness that the societies have. * Traditional authority is based on a tradition or custom that is followed by the traditional leaders. In traditional authority, status is a key concept. There are no requirements to serving as a traditional leader but there are no salaries. The consequences to traditional authority are discouragement of education and rational calculation. * Traditional authority consists of a dominant profile, one who embodies tradition and rule. This type of leadership exemplifies the power to construct order. === 2. Rational-legal authority: rational grounds === * Acquired from law and is constructed from the reliance of society's rules and laws. This type of authority has the confidence to leave the right of leaders to undertake the decisions and set the policy. Rational-legal authority is the basis of modern democracies. Examples of this type of authority: officials elected by voters, * Rational-legal authority is built on a structure of bureaucracy. In a rational-legal authority one ascends in their career paths through promotion and they eventually retire. Some of the benefits of rational-legal authority are transportation, large-scale industry, mass communication and an income economy. Other outcomes of rational-legal authority are tendencies towards equal opportunity and a promotion of education. * Rational-legal authority requires a logical and systematic approach to leadership. Weber's rational leadership prevails in decision making. === 3. Charismatic authority: charismatic grounds === * Comes from individuals and their personal qualities that they have to offer. Certain individuals are influential to others with their unique qualities which help them gain followers. The \\"charismatic\\" individuals exercise power and authority over a whole society or even a specific group of within a bigger society. The exercise of their power of these individuals are either for good or bad. Examples of these charismatic leaders can range from: Joan of Arc to Adolf Hitler or Martin Luther king Jr to Jesus Christ. * Charismatic authority has no clear structure. It is based one's individual influence. One is chosen to be staff by their charismatic characteristics. Someone under a charismatic authority lives under gifts not salary. As long as someone has influence they will be a legitimate power. * In charismatic authority, confidence is the driving force for leadership. With charismatic authority leadership has the ability to connect distinct groups and lead them to the finish line. ==Emergence of the modern state== Weber wrote that the modern state based on rational-legal authority emerged from the patrimonial and feudal struggle for power (see traditional authority) uniquely in the Occidental civilization. The prerequisites for the modern Western state are: * Monopolization by central authority of the means of administration and control based on a centralized and stable system of taxation and use of physical force * Monopolization of legislative * Organisation of an officialdom, dependent upon the central authority Weber argued that some of those attributes have existed in various time or places, but together they existed only in Occidental civilization. The conditions that favoured this were * Emergence of rational-legal rationality (various status groups in the Occident promoted that emergence) * Emergence of modern officialdom (bureaucracy), which required ** Development of the money economy, where officials are compensated in money instead of kind (usually land grants) ** Quantitative and qualitative expansion of administrative tasks ** Centralization and increased efficiency of administration. Weber's belief that rational-legal authority did not exist in Imperial China has been heavily criticized, and does not have many supporters in the early 21st century. ==Modern state== According to Max Weber, a modern state exists where a political community has: * An administrative and legal order that has been created and can be changed by legislation that also determines its role * Binding authority over citizens and actions in its jurisdiction * The right to legitimately use the physical force in its jurisdiction An important attribute of Weber's definition of a modern state was that it is a bureaucracy. The vast majority of the modern states from the 20th century onward fall under the rational-legal authority category. ==Rational-legal leaders== The majority of modern bureaucratic officials and political leaders represent this type of authority. _Officials:_ * Are personally free. * Serve a higher authority. * Are appointed on the basis of conduct and their technical qualifications. * Are responsible for the impartial execution of assigned tasks. * Their work is a full-time occupation. * Their work is methodical and rational * Their work is rewarded by a salary and prospects of career advancement. _Politicians:_ * Are solely responsible for independent action. * Must recognize that public actions that conflict with their basic policy must be rejected. * Should have charismatic appeal to win elections under conditions of universal suffrage. _Additional, Weber provided ten necessities addressing: \\"how individual officials are appointed and work\\". The administrative staff are under the supreme authority for legal authority in a bureaucratic administrative style._ # They are personally free and subject to authority only with respect to their impersonal official obligation. # They are organized in a clearly defined hierarchy of offices. # Each office has a clearly defined sphere of competence in the legal sense. # The office is filled by a free contractual relationship or free selection. # Candidates are selected on the basis of technical qualification. # They are remunerated by fixed salaries in money for the most part, with a right to pensions. # The office is treated as the sole, or at least primary, occupation of incumbent. # It constitutes a career. Promotions are dependent on the judgement of superiors. # The official works entirely separated from ownership of the means of administration and without appropriation of his/her position. # He is subject to strict and systematic discipline and control in the conduct of the office. ==See also== * Power (social and political) ==References== ==Further reading== * Categorical reasons, Divine command theory, Inescapable rational authority, Meta-ethics, Rationalized Bonds of Office * Perrow, Charles (1972).

His mother is a Swiss and his father is an ethnic Albanian from Kosovo. He has a younger brother, Simon.Weltenbummler mit Wurzeln im Hinterland. Neue Luzerner Zeitung. 2012-10-12. At the age of fourteen, Nuo abandoned all hope of becoming a popular tennis pro and decided to focus on a musical career instead. After a few misleading steps at home, he managed to move to Hamburg, Germany where he was engaged as a backing vocalist for several record productions. In the meantime he also worked as a model for charity projects. His final home of residence for many years now is Los Angeles, California. ===Career=== In 2002, Patrick met producer and songwriter David Jost, who helped Nuo sign a contract with Warner Music. In the following months, the duo created a whole album together, which was eventually released under the name Welcome in September 2003. A top 20 chart success in Switzerland and Germany, it spawned three singles; including debut single \\"5 Days\\" and follow-up \\"Reanimate\\", which reached number 18 on the Swiss Singles Chart. That same year, Nuo joined Zeichen der Zeit, a Christian music project whose first single \\"Du bist nicht allein\\" became a top ten success in Germany. A second single released from the project's self-titled compilation album, \\"Ein weiterer Morgen\\", entered the top forty of the German Singles Chart the following year. Also in 2004, a reissue of Welcome was released. It produced the single \\"Undone\\", which served as the theme song for American comedy film Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004) in German-speaking Europe. In May 2005, Nuo's second album Superglue was released. While not as commercially successful as Welcome in Germany, it would eventually become his highest- charting to date, reaching number four on the Swiss Albums Chart. Two singles were released from Superglue: \\"Girl in the Moon\\" and \\"Beautiful\\", the latter of which became his first and only top ten hit to-date. The song peaked at number nine and number seven in Switzerland and Austria respectively. In 2006, Nuo reteamed with Zeichen der Zeit to produce their second album Generation David (2006), and participated in another non-profit aid project when he provided vocals for the Fury in the Slaughterhouse cover, charity single \\"Won't Forget These Days,\\" released during the 2006 FIFA World Cup. In 2007, after a label change to Ariola Records, Nuo's third album Nuo was released.

The main reason for the given state of affairs is that it \\"has always been that way\\". ==In sociology== In sociology, the concept of traditional authority (domination) comes from Max Weber's tripartite classification of authority, the other two forms being charismatic authority and rational-legal authority. All of those three domination types represent an example of his ideal type concept. Weber noted that in history those ideal types of domination are always found in combinations. In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the authority comes from tradition; in charismatic authority from the personality and leadership qualities of the individual; and in rational-legal authority from people that are bureaucratically and legally attached to certain positions. ===Patriarchs and their households=== Weber derives the traditional domination from patriarchies and their households ‚Äì in other words, from the ancient tradition of family (the authority of a master over his household). The master is designated in accordance with the rules of inheritance. He has no administrative staff nor any machinery to enforce his will by force alone; he depends on the willingness of the group members to respect his authority. Those members stand in personal relations to him. They obey him based on the belief that this is their duty sanctioned by immemorial tradition and on feeling of filial piety for the person of the master. === Patrimonialism === Patrimonial government occurs when the ruler's household expands with the household administration giving rise to governmental offices. All officials are personal dependents or favourites of the ruler, appointed by him. Their interactions with the ruler are based on paternal authority and filial dependence. The officials treat their work as a personal service to the ruler. The ruler has complete control over the officials; he empowers them from case to case, assigns specific tasks, promotes and demotes. They have no rights, rather they have privileges granted and withdrawn by the ruler. It is rare to discover any clear and stable hierarchy and responsibility in the deluge of official titles of most patrimonial administrations. Military force is an important instrument of a patrimonial rule. Weber distinguished five types of military organisations. In all of those cases the military is a tool of the ruler, solely for his use‚Äîbut he is responsible for its upkeep (equipment, maintenance and wages). With the growth of the territory organized and more independent administrative staff and military force became a necessity. This usually leads to decentralisation, and some individuals gain more independence in the form of certain rights (for example, the right to inheritance and marriage without the consent of the rulers, to be judged by independent courts instead of officials of the royal household, etc.). One of the best examples of almost pure type of patrimonialism is ancient Egypt, where the population was entirely dependent upon the control of the waterways (Nile River). This facilitated the creation of centralised government. When the royal household required it, the individual had to perform the public duties, such as participate in labor- intensive project (rising of the pyramids). Thus the whole country was in fact the patriarchal household of the pharaoh. When land is given to military or officials for the performance of their duties, their independence increases and the power of the ruler weakens (consider the Mameluks and their rebellions, or the difference between Chinese Confucian literati who were never able to overthrow the power of the emperor and European knights who evolved into powerful aristocracy in many cases vastly limiting the power of the kings (especially in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth)). Patrimonial dominance has often prevailed in the Orient, where land remained in the control of the ruler. However, in the Occident the ruler lost control of the lands given to the nobility, which according to Weber was a major reason for patrimonialism being replaced by feudalism. ===Feudalism=== When compared to patrimonalism, feudalism has one major similarity and several important differences. The similarity is that both are based on tradition and have powerful rulers who grant rights in return for military and administrative services. The differences are important for the subtler distinction: * feudalism replaces the paternal relationship of patrimonalism by a contract of allegiance based on knightly militarism. * the patrimonial ruler's grants of authority and the personal dependence of official are replaced in feudalism by the contractual freedom, personal allegiance and socioeconomic prominence on the part of the vassals. ===Traditional leaders=== Most of the representatives of any dynasty ruling for more than one generation (kings, emperors, sultans, etc.) would fall into that category. Thus majority monarchies and some autocracies, oligarchies, and theocracies would be ruled by traditional leaders. Often the male head of a common family should be considered a traditional leader. This could also be the case in a family-owned business if its director and other leadership positions are chosen based on family ties and/or age. ==See also== * Pre-industrial society * The Three Types of Legitimate Rule ==External links== * South Africa: traditional leaders Category:Authority Category:Max Weber Category:Sociological terminology ","title":"Traditional authority"},{"id":"845766","text":"Options is a 1975 absurdist science fiction novel by American writer Robert Sheckley, published in paperback by Pyramid Books. The first British edition appeared in 1977, and a French translation was published in 1979.ISFDB bibliography The story is ostensibly about a marooned space traveller's attempt to get a spare part for his starship, the Intrepid III. He has a robotic guard, programmed to guard him against all planetary dangers. But soon he discovers that the robot has not been programmed for the planet where they are, with comic results. However, the narrative later descends into a mass of diversions, non-sequiturs and meditations on the nature of authorship. Eventually the diversions take over the book to the extent that the author openly introduces an increasingly bizarre succession of deus ex machina in an attempt to get the novel back on track, but eventually admits defeat. ==Reception== Spider Robinson reviewed the novel favorably, declaring that although Sheckley deliberately broke most of the rules for successful storytelling, Options was \\"hilarious... an exploding cigarette, a velvet banana, a bearded tractor, a Presbyterian platypus.\\"\\"Galaxy Bookshelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, October 1975, pp.141-42 Dave Langford reviewed Options for White Dwarf #86, and stated that \\"the author is 'unable' to construct a credible plot device to save the situation.

First described in 1888 by George Albert Boulenger, U. phantasticus is the smallest in body of the Uroplatus geckos, though there is an ongoing debate as to whether one of its cousins, U. ebenaui, is smaller because of its shorter tail. It may also be known as the eyelash leaf-tailed gecko or the phantastic leaf-tailed gecko. ==Etymology== The generic name, Uroplatus, is a Latinization of two Greek words: \\"our√°\\" (Œø·ΩêœÅŒ¨) meaning \\"tail\\" and \\"platys\\" (œÄŒªŒ±œÑœçœÇ) meaning \\"flat\\". Its specific name phantasticus is the Latin word for \\"imaginary\\", based upon the gecko's unique appearance, which led Belgian naturalist George Albert Boulenger to describe it as ‚Äúmythical‚Äù in 1888. ==Distribution and habitat== The species is endemic to Madagascar, meaning it is found nowhere else. It is an arboreal species that relies on its natural camouflage in the northern and central tropical forests of Madagascar. ==Description== Its adult size is up to 90mm in total length, including the tail. As with all Uroplatus geckos the tail is flattened, but the leaf-like appearance is only seen in the ebenaui complex (U. phantasticus, U. ebenaui, and U. malama; although the tail size is much reduced in U. ebenaui). It has often been debated whether U. phantasticus is in fact the same species as U. ebenaui (the Nosy B√© flat-tailed gecko). However U. phantasticus possesses more, and longer, spines on the head, body and trunk. Other members of the genus Uroplatus have flattened tails that serve more to diminish the profile of the gecko while it is inactive. Some U. phantasticus geckos even have notches in their tails to further mimic a decaying leaf. This is also thought to be a form of sexual dimorphism, as the trait seems more common in the males of the species. In addition, U. phantasticus has an eyelash-like projection above each eye. During daylight hours, these adaptations help the gecko blend into its surroundings. At night it helps the gecko hunt for prey by providing camouflage. Geckos possess no eyelids, just a transparent covering over their eyes, and so they use their long, mobile tongues to wipe away any dust or debris that gets into the eye. The gecko occurs in a variety of colors, including hues of purple, orange, tan and yellow, but is often mottled brown, with small black dots on the underside that help to distinguish it from similar species.

The adhesive scales under their fingers and toes and their strong curved claws enable them to move adeptly through the trees. The leaf-tailed gecko is somewhat of an expert at avoiding predators, not only through their incredible mimicry but through a number of behaviours. They can flatten their body against the substrate to reduce the body's shadow, open their jaws wide to show a frightening, bright red mouth, and voluntarily shed their tail in order to trick a predator. Like many reptiles, the leaf-tailed gecko is oviparous, or egg-laying. Reproduction starts at the beginning of the rainy season when it lays clutches of two spherical eggs onto the ground under leaf litter or in the dead leaves of plants. ==Captivity== Uroplatus phantasticus is common in captivity and often kept in breeding pairs or trios. Males can be housed together as intraspecific aggression tends to be low when captive conditions are sufficient. However, even in good circumstances, there is occasional male-male aggression. Keepers of this species often simply refer to them as Phants. The gecko eats a variety of appropriately sized insects including crickets and moths. If breeding is successful in captivity, eggs will be laid at intervals of approximately 30 days and take 90 to 120 days to hatch. There are seven zoos in the United States that have this gecko, two of which breed it, including the San Diego Zoo.Stetz, M. Zoo's first 2011 baby: Satanic leaf-tailed gecko. San Diego Union-Tribune January 6, 2011. ==Threats== Habitat destruction, deforestation, and collection for the pet trade all threaten the existence of this animal. Studies suggest that leaf-tailed geckos can only inhabit a very specific environment and are not tolerant of any degradation of its natural habitat. This makes the satanic leaf-tailed gecko very vulnerable to the impacts of habitat degradation and harvesting, a common problem due to it being a very popular pet. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) lists all of the Uroplatus species on their \\"Top ten most wanted species list\\" of animals threatened by illegal wildlife trade, because of it \\"being captured and sold at alarming rates for the international pet trade\\". It is a CITES Appendix 2 protected animal. ==Conservation== The survival of the satanic leaf-tailed gecko is intrinsically linked to the continued existence of its Madagascan rainforest habitat. Protected areas are therefore essential, and at present, the satanic leaf-tailed gecko is known to occur in at least three: Tsaratanana Strict Nature Reserve, Marojejy National Park or Anjanaharibe Special Reserve. However, illegal harvesting of leaf-tailed geckos is known to occur even within protected areas, and efforts to control this threatening activity are required if this extraordinary and unique reptile is to endure. This gecko is not a prey of birds, as commonly thought. ==References== == External links == * phantasticus Category:Endemic fauna of Madagascar Category:Reptiles of Africa Category:Reptiles described in 1888 ","title":"Uroplatus phantasticus"},{"id":"845810","text":"Geographic profiling is a criminal investigative methodology that analyzes the locations of a connected series of crimes to determine the most probable area of offender residence. By incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methods, it assists in understanding spatial behaviour of an offender and focusing the investigation to a smaller area of the community. Typically used in cases of serial murder or rape (but also arson, bombing, robbery, terrorism and other crimes), the technique helps police detectives prioritize information in large-scale major crime investigations that often involve hundreds or thousands of suspects and tips. In addition to determining the offender's most likely area of residence, an understanding of the spatial pattern of a crime series and the characteristics of the crime sites can tell investigators other useful information, such as whether the crime was opportunistic and the degree of offender familiarity with the crime location. This is based on the connection between an offender's behavior and his or her non-criminal life.Wortley and Mazerolle 2008, p. 136. Geographic profiling is growing in popularity and, combined with offender profiling, can be a helpful tool in the investigation of serial crime. == Development == While the use of spatial analysis methods in police investigations goes back many years (think of detectives gathered around a large city map with pins stuck in it), the formalized process known today as geographic profiling originated out of research conducted at Simon Fraser University's School of Criminology in British Columbia, Canada, in 1989. Geographic profiling model is based on the assumption that offenders are more likely to select their victims and commit a crime which would be centered near their home address. The technique has now spread to several U.S., Canadian, British, and European law enforcement agencies. Originally designed for violent crime investigations, it is increasingly being used on property crime. Through numerous research studies, there has been an increased importance placed on the journeys offenders habitually take to determine the spatial range of criminal activity. These areas become a comfort zone for predatory offenders to commit their crime with a feeling of safety. Consequently, criminal acts follow a distance-decay function, such that the further away the regular activity space of an offender is, the less likely that the person will engage in a predatory criminal activity. However, there is also a buffer zone where an offender will avoid committing crimes too close to their homes in the likely event that they will be identified by a neighbour.Hicks and Sales 2006, p. 221. === Central concepts === The theoretical foundation of geographic profiling is in environmental criminology.Wortley and Mazerolle 2008, p. 137-138. Key concepts include: *Journey-to-Crime :Supports the notion that crimes are likely to occur closer to an offender‚Äôs home and follow a distance-decay function (DDF) with crimes less likely to occur the further away an offender is from their home base. It is concerned with the ‚Äòdistance of crime‚Äô and that offenders will in general travel limited distances to commit their crimes. *Routine Activity Theory :Originally developed by Cohen and Felson (1979), the primary principle is that the offender and victim must intersect in time and space for a crime to occur. This approach focuses on the concept that crime occurs when an opportunity is taken within both parties‚Äô non-criminal spatial activity. An activity space may consist of the regular areas an offender travels such as work, school, home or recreational areas. *Rational Choice Theory :Concepts relating to the explanation of spatial behaviour include the least-effort principle where offenders are more likely to act on the first or opportunity and the idea of a buffer zone. It exhibits a constant tension between the offender‚Äôs desire to divert attention from his home base and the desire to travel no further than necessary to commit crimes. *Crime Pattern Theory :Developed by Canadian environmental criminologists Paul and Patricia Brantingham, the theory exerts the strongest influence in geographic profiling. It suggests that crime sites and opportunities are not random. There is an emphasis in the interaction between the offender‚Äôs mental map of spatial surroundings and the allotment of victims (target backcloth). Furthermore, serial crimes are the easiest to develop geographic profiles, since each crime contains new spatial information and provides additional data including the fact that crime area tends to enlarge with an increase of comfort and confidence. The initial hunt and criminal acts are most likely to occur relatively close to the location of the offender's home or workplace. As the success rate increases, there will be a burgeoning sense of confidence to seek his prey further from home and to travel a greater distance. Crimes that are suitable for analysis are those that are predatory in nature and exercises some spatial decision-making process such as the area for hunting targets, travel routes, mode of transportation and even body dump sites.Holmes and Holmes 1996, p. 155. Another leading researcher in this area is David Canter whose approach to geographic profiling detailed around the circle theory of environmental range. In 1993, Canter and Larkin developed two models of offender behaviour: marauder and commuter models.Canter, D., & Larkin, P. (1993). The environmental range of serial rapists. Journal of Environmental Psychology, V. 13, pp. 63‚Äì69. The distinction is that marauders operate in an area that is in close proximity of the offender's home base while commuters commit crimes far outside of the habitual zone. It hopes to differentiate the two types of serial offenders by studying the relationship of the criminal spatial behaviour to the offender's place of residence.Meaney 2004 ==Considerations== In developing a geographic profile, there are important factors to consider:Wortley and Mazerolle 2008, p. 143. *Crime locations A crime will contain evidence. The evidence found at the location provides information leading to the offender and victim's prior location, clues as to where they may have gone, as well as information depicting what happened. Collecting and comparing clues from numerous crime locations influences the development of the offender's patterns. *Offender type According to Dr. Kim Rossmo there are four different types of offenders with regard to geographic profiling. Hunter: the hunter singles out a specific victim without leaving his home territory. He will commit crimes where he lives. Poacher: a poacher will travel out of his home territory to do his hunting. Troller: A troller will realize an opportunistic encounter while occupied in other activities and then strike. Trapper: a trapper will draw the victim into him using different seemingly harmless situations. *Hunting Methods Hunting process can be broken down into two parts. (1) The search for a suitable victim, and (2) the method of attack. *Target backcloth (the spatial opportunity structure of crime sites) ‚ÄúTarget or victim backcloth is important for an understanding of the geometric arrangement of crime sites; it is the equivalent of the spatial opportunity structure (Brantingham & Brantigham, 1993b). It is configured by both geographic and temporal distribution of ‚Äúsuitable‚Äù (as seen from the offenders perspective) crime targets or victims across the physical landscape. The availability of particular targets may vary significantly according to neighborhood, area, or even city, and is influenced by time, day of week, and season; hence, the term structural backcloth is also used.‚Äùpg. 127. Geographic Profiling by Dr. Kim Rossmo *Arterial roads and highways Large Roads and highways play a huge part in crime strictly because it how both criminals and victims are forced to travel. Crimes will often cluster around freeway exits and entrances. *Bus stops and train stations These are two forms of rapid transportation that may also be used by offenders and victims and can be hot spots in certain areas. *Physical and psychological boundaries Offender and victim alike are both restrained by physical boundaries such as rivers, lakes, oceans or highways. Psychological boundaries may also affect movement, for example a black offender may not travel into a white neighborhood for fear or being identified. *Land use *Neighbourhood demographics Certain offenders prefer a certain ethnicity of victim, if so then he may hunt in different neighborhoods affecting spatial crime patterns. *Routine activities of victims Understanding the routine of a victim may provide insight into how the offender searches for his victims. *Singularities *Displacement Incorporating these factors in a profile can lead to a geographic pattern where it sheds light on an offender's mobility, method of transportation, ability to navigate boundaries and most importantly, the possible residential location. It is important to recognize such spatial intentionality, to determine the offender's comfort zone and their desire to commit crimes in locations where they feel a sense of familiarity. However, the reality may be more complex since an offender may have multiple spatial anchor points, such as home, workplace or the residence of their significant other.Lersch 2007, p. 250. ==Tools== Geographic profiling is an investigative tool that can be seen as a strategic information management system to assist police with the large volume of information throughout an investigation. It concentrates its focus on the geographic aspects of the crime and was developed in response to the demands of solving serial crimes.Wortley and Mazerolle 2008, p. 136. In response, Rossmo developed a computerized geographic profiling algorithm called criminal geographic targeting (CGT) which assess the spatial characteristics of crimes. It analyzes the geographic coordinates of the offender's crimes and produces a color map which assigns probabilities to different points for the most likely area of the offender's home base. CGT has been patentedRossmo, D. K. (1996). U.S. Patent No. 5,781,704. Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. and integrated into a specialized crime analysis software product called Rigel. The Rigel product is developed by the software company Environmental Criminology Research Inc. (ECRI), which Rossmo co-founded.Rich, T. and Shively, M (2004, December). P. 14. A Methodology for Evaluating Geographic Profiling Software. U.S. Department of Justice, Retrieved from https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/208993.pdf Geographic Profilers often employ tools such as Rigel, CrimeStat or Gemini to perform geographic analysis. System inputs are crime location addresses or coordinates, often entered through a geographic information system (GIS). Output is a jeopardy surface (three-dimensional probability surface) or color geoprofile, which depicts the most likely areas of offender residence or search base. These programs assist crime analysts and investigators to focus their resources more effectively by highlighting the crucial geographic areas. ==Geographic Profiling Analysis (GPA) training== Geographic profiling is a sub-type of offender or criminal profiling (the inference of offender characteristics from offence characteristics). It is therefore related to psychological or behavioral profiling. If psychological profiling is the \\"who,\\" geographic profiling is the \\"where.\\" All certified geographic profilers are members of the International Criminal Investigative Analysis Fellowship (ICIAF), a professional profiling organization first begun by investigators trained by the FBI in the mid-1980s. A Geographic Profiling Analysis (GPA) training programme has also been created and is governed by the Committee for GPA Training and Certification (CGPATC).http://www.cgpatc.org/ The program has been designed so that geographic profiling analysis remains a recognized law enforcement tool; a meaningful certification for crime analysts and detectives; a standard of quality through adequate qualifications in law enforcements is maintained; and finally to establish an ethical code of conduct. ==Limitations== Although geographic profiling is a useful tool for assisting investigations, e.g. in prioritizing suspects, like any other models there are certain limitations: *Benefit in the case of a single crime may be limited. *It may be most useful against impulsive crimes by impulsive offendersLaukkanen, M. M. (2007).. *It may not distinguish between multiple offenders operating in the same area and following similar modi operandi. *Although computer systems can be highly sophisticated, they cannot analyze all the information involved in a crime series and they are only as good as the accuracy of their algorithms' underlying assumptions. *In crimes against lucrative targets the residential location of the perpetrator may be of small significance compared to the location of the target. ==See also== *Rossmo's formula, a geographic profiling formula to predict where a serial criminal lives *Environmental Criminology Research Inc., Developer of Rigel, a software package that utilizes Rossmo's formula General: *Crime mapping *Offender profiling ==Notes== ==References== * Brantingham, P.

In baseball, an out occurs when the umpire rules a batter or baserunner out for one of the reasons given below. When three outs are recorded in an inning, a team's half of the inning (their turn at batting), ends. To signal an out, an umpire generally makes a fist with one hand, and then flexes that arm either upward, particularly on pop flies, or forward, particularly on routine plays at first base. Home plate umpires often use a \\"punch-out\\" motion to signal a called third strike. ==Ways of making outs== * Some common ways batters or runners are put out are when: ** The batter strikes out; ** The batter flies out; ** a baserunner is tagged out; ** a baserunner is forced out. * The batter is out when: ** Strikeout-related outs: *** with two strikes, the batter swings at a pitched ball and misses;Baseball Explained by Phillip Mahony, McFarland Books, 2014. See www.baseballexplained.com *** with two strikes, they do not swing at a pitch that the umpire judges to be in the strike zone (and the catcher catches the ball and does not drop it); *** The batter foul tips a pitch directly back into the catcher's mitt, and the catcher holds the ball and does not drop it;Baseball Explained by Phillip Mahony, McFarland Books, 2014. See www.baseball explained.com *** with two strikes, they bunt a pitch into foul territory; *** the third strike is pitched and caught in flight; *** on any third strike, if a baserunner is on first and there are fewer than two outs (even when not caught); ** Outs related to the batter's box: *** they are hit by their own fair ball, outside the batter's box, before the ball is played by a fielder; *** they hit a pitch while one foot is entirely outside the batter's box; *** they step from one batter's box to the other when the pitcher is ready to pitch; ** Other ways of being out: *** they commit interference; *** they fail to bat in their proper turn and is discovered in an appeal; or *** they are found to have used an altered bat. * Ways that runners can be out: ** The batter-runner is out when: *** a preceding runner interferes with a fielder trying to complete a double play on the batter- runner; *** Tag-related outs: **** a fielder with a live ball in their possession touches first base or tags the batter-runner before the batter- runner reaches first base (except when the batter is awarded first base, such as on a base on balls) **** the batter-runner does not return directly to first base after overrunning the bag and they are tagged with the ball by a fielder. *** Flyout-related outs: **** a batted ball is caught in flight (fly out); **** they hit an infield popup while the infield fly rule applies; **** a fielder intentionally drops a line drive with fewer than two outs in a force situation (man on first, men on first and second, men on first and third, bases loaded) in an attempt to create a double play; ** Any baserunner, other than the batter-runner, is out when: *** they are forced out; that is, they fail to reach their force base before a fielder with a live ball touches that base; *** a fielder catches a batted ball in flight, and subsequently, some fielder with a live ball in possession touches the runner's time of pitch base before the runner tags up (appeal play); *** while they are attempting to reach home plate with fewer than two outs, the batter interferes with a fielder and such action hinders a potential tag out near home plate; *** they are found to have committed a mockery of the game, for example, a stolen base of first from the second; or *** they are found to be an illegal substitute. ** Any baserunner, including the batter-runner, is out when: *** they are tagged out; that is, touched by a fielder's hand holding a live ball while in jeopardy, such as while not touching a base; *** they stray more than three feet (.91 meters) from their running baseline in attempting to avoid a tag; *** they pass a base without touching it and a member of the defensive team properly executes a live ball appeal; *** they pass a preceding runner who is not out; *** they commit interference, such as when they contact a fielder playing a batted ball, or when they contact a live batted ball before it passes a fielder other than the pitcher; *** they are touched by a fair ball in fair territory before the ball has touched or passed an infielder. The ball is dead and no runner may score, nor runners advance, except runners forced to advance. EXCEPTION: If a runner is touching their base when touched by an infield fly, they are not out, although the batter is out; *** they intentionally abandon their effort to run the bases after touching first base; or *** they run the bases in reverse order in an attempt to confuse the defense or to make a travesty of the game. ==Crediting outs== In baseball statistics, each out must be credited to exactly one defensive player, namely the player who was the direct cause of the out. When referring to outs credited to a defensive player, the term putout is used. Example: a batter hits a fair ball that is fielded by the shortstop. The shortstop then throws the ball to the first baseman. The first baseman then steps on first base before the batter reaches it. For this play, only the first baseman is credited with a putout, while the shortstop is credited with an assist. For a strikeout, the catcher is credited with a putout, because the batter is not out until the pitched ball is caught by the catcher. (If the catcher drops the third strike and has to throw the batter-runner out at the first base, the first baseman receives the putout while the catcher receives an assist.) When an out is recorded without a fielder's direct involvement, such as where a runner is hit by a batted ball, the fielder nearest to the action is usually credited with the putout. Although pitchers seldom get credited with putouts, they are credited with their role in getting outs through various pitching statistics such as innings pitched (a measure of the number of outs made by the pitcher, used in calculating their ERA) and strikeouts. ==See also== *Safe (baseball) *Tie goes to the runner ==Further reading== *Official rules for batters, including when the batter is out *Official rules for runners, including when the runner is out ==References== Category:Baseball rules Category:Baseball terminology ","title":"Out (baseball)"},{"id":"845827","text":"Kerosene is a type of fuel, but it can also refer to: * power kerosene; see tractor vaporising oil. * a lubricant; see mineral oil. * a song by Bad Religion from their album Recipe for Hate. * a song by Big Black from their album Atomizer. * a song by The Bottle Rockets. * a song by Crystal Castles, from their album (III). * Kerosene (album), the debut album of Miranda Lambert. :*\\"Kerosene\\" (song), the title track to this album * a novel written by Chris Wooding ==See also== * Paraffin (disambiguation) * Kerosene lamp * Pressurised-burner stoves * Naphtha ","title":"Kerosene (disambiguation)"},{"id":"845828","text":"The Rally of the Republicans (; abbreviated RDR) is a liberal party in Ivory Coast ().

Dj√©ni Kobina became the new party's Secretary-General. The RDR sought for Ouattara, who had served as Prime Minister from 1990 to 1993, to become its candidate in the 1995 presidential election. However, amendments to the electoral code required presidential candidates to have lived in the country for five years and to have been born of Ivorian parents. It was thought that these provisions were specifically intended to keep Ouattara out of the running; he had been deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund for almost five years and his father's family had roots in Burkina Faso. For this reason the RDR boycotted the election.Robert J. Mundt, \\"C√¥te d'Ivoire: Continuity and Change in a Semi-Democracy\\", Political Reform in Francophone Africa (1997), ed.

Lovett's comedy has a quiet, dead-pan surrealism, and in 2000, he made a successful stand-up tour, co-headlining with Chris Barrie, who played Rimmer in Red Dwarf. In 2008 Lovett co-headlined a stand-up tour with Hattie Hayridge, who played the female version of Holly in Red Dwarf. His career as a stand-up comedian has included regular appearances at the Edinburgh Fringe. Comedian Stewart Lee has cited Lovett as an influence, and on occasion the two have featured on the same bill, including an alternative comedy showcase event in 2011, curated by Lee at the Royal Festival Hall. In 2008, Lovett released his first stand-up DVD Bags and Biscuits. In 2012, he released his second stand-up DVD, Norman Lovett: Outside the Box. From 2014 to 2018, Lovett was a main cast member in BBC Radio 4 comedy To Hull and Back, alongside Maureen Lipman and series creator Lucy Beaumont. == Red Dwarf == Lovett played the role of Holly in Red Dwarf in its first and second series. Starting from the third series, Lovett declined to join the cast when Red Dwarf filming moved to London, while Lovett had moved to Edinburgh, with the distance between the two cities decreasing his willingness to participate. Lovett returned in the seventh series as a guest star and the eighth as a regular. However, a disagreement with writer/producer Doug Naylor meant that for a period Lovett refused to take part in any further Red Dwarf productions. Following the success of Red Dwarf X, Lovett resumed contact with Naylor, resulting in his guest appearance in the twelfth series episode \\"Skipper\\". After this, Lovett resumed his role as Holly in the 2020 special The Promised Land. Lovett has also played the role of Holly in Red Dwarf-related releases, such as the \\"Tongue Tied\\" music video, a sketch for BBC's Children in Need, the interactive DVD game Beat the Geek, and additional footage filmed for Red Dwarf Remastered. == Other activities == Lovett is known for political activism. He has performed stand-up comedy on numerous occasions for 'Stand Up For Labour' in support of the said party. In 2016, he was awarded Stand Up For Labour's Act of the Year. In September 2016, Lovett performed at the 'Keep Corbyn' rally in Brighton, in support of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. Lovett's voice is available as an in-game purchase in the 2014 game Elite Dangerous, allowing the user to customise the ships 'COVAS' speech system.http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/news/2015/03/27/fly- with-norman/ Lovett has stated that one of his personal career highlights was supporting punk rock band The Clash. ==References== == External links == * Category:1946 births Category:English male television actors Category:English male comedians Category:Living people Category:People from Windsor, Berkshire Category:Labour Party (UK) people ","title":"Norman Lovett"},{"id":"845831","text":"The Cuban Liberal Union () is a liberal party in Cuba.

A socialite generally spends a significant amount of time attending various fashionable social gatherings. ==United Kingdom== Historically, socialites in the United Kingdom were almost exclusively from the families of the aristocracy and gentry. Many socialites also had strong familial or personal relationships to the British royal family. Between the 17th and early 19th centuries, society events in London and at country houses were the focus of socialite activity. Notable examples of British socialites include Beau Brummell, Lord Alvanley, the Marchioness of Londonderry, Daisy, Princess of Pless, Lady Diana Cooper, Mary Constance Wyndham, Lady Ursula d'Abo, and the Mitford sisters. Since the 1960s, socialites have been drawn from a wider section of society more similar to the American model, with many socialites now coming from families in business or from the world of celebrity. Despite this, the notion of the Sloane ranger still emphasises many socialites' connections to Britain's ruling class. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is widely regarded as the current home of socialite activity in the UK. The television show Made in Chelsea has explored the lifestyles of young socialites living in London in the 21st century. ==United States== American members of the Establishment, or an American \\"society\\" based on birth, breeding, education, and economic standing, were originally listed in the Social Register, a directory of the names and addresses of the \\"preferred social contacts\\" of the prominent families in the 19th century. In 1886, Louis Keller started to consolidate these lists and package them for sale. ===18th and 19th centuries=== The concept of socialites dates to the 18th and 19th century. Most of the earliest socialites were wives or mistresses of royalty or nobility, but being a socialite was more a duty and a means of survival than a form of pleasure. Bashful queens were often forced to play gracious and wealthy hostess to people who despised them. Mistresses had to pay for their social reputation and had to use their social skills to obtain favor in the court and retain the interest of their lovers. With the increase of wealth in America in the 19th century, being a socialite developed into a role that brought power and influence. ===20th century=== The word \\"socialite\\" appears the first time in English language in 1928, in Time magazine.https://www.etymonline.com/word/socialite ===21st century=== In the 21st century, the term \\"socialite\\" is still attached to being wealthy and socially recognized. The lines between being a socialite and celebrity with an exuberant partying lifestyle have since become blurred due to the influence of both popular culture and the media, particularly when the status of being a celebrity is largely due to that lifestyle. Celebrity Paris Hilton is an example of a 21st-century socialite due to her ability to attract media attention and fame based on her connections and associations. Hilton is the great-granddaughter of Conrad Hilton, the founder of Hilton Hotels & Resorts, and heiress to the Hilton Hotel fortune. Due to her outrageous lifestyle, Hilton was hailed by the media as \\"New York's leading It Girl\\" in 2001.\\" Gossip Girl, an American television series airing between September 2007 and December 2012, focuses on the lives of New York City socialites who live on Manhattan's Upper East Side. The show is a strong influence on how socialites are regarded in the 21st century because of the presence of scandal, wealth, and fashion in each episode. Pop culture gives the impression that by simply being wealthy and fashionable, an individual has the opportunity to become famous. Consequently, it is an individual's ability to climb the social ladder due to his or her wealth and recognition that makes them a socialite. According to The New York Times, socialites spend between $98,000 and $455,000 per year (young and old, respectively) to maintain their roles as successful socialites. Just the evening wardrobe of an individual regularly attending society functions can cost $100,000 annually. Examples of American socialites include: Tiffany Trump, Kim Kardashian, Jill Kelley, Tinsley Mortimer, Olivia Palermo, Lauren Santo Domingo, Paris Hilton, Derek Blasberg, and Jean Shafiroff. == Famous historical socialites == File:Caroline Schermerhorn Astor.jpgCaroline Schermerhorn Astor (1830-1908) File:Jackie Kennedy on her wedding day,Rhode Island,September 12, 1953.jpgJacqueline Kennedy Onassis (1929-1994) File:Alva Vanderbilt Belmont.jpgAlva Vanderbilt Belmont (1853-1933) File:Wallis Simpson headshot.jpgWallis Simpson, Duchess of Windsor (1896-1986) File:Portrait of Edith Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry.jpgEdith Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry (1878-1959) File:Lady Jennie Spencer-Churchill (1854-1921) (A).jpgLady Randolph Churchill (1854-1921) File:Kathleenkennedy.webpKathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington (1920-1948) File:BrummellEngrvFrmMiniature.jpgBeau Brummell (1778-1840) ==See also== * Bon viveur * Conspicuous leisure * Debutante * Elitism * Famous for being famous * Ingroups and outgroups * International Debutante Ball * It girl * Jet set * List of American heiresses * Sloane Ranger * Social environment * Upper class * White Anglo-Saxon Protestant * Yuppie ==References== Category:17th-century introductions Category:Occupations * Category:Sociological terminology ","title":"Socialite"},{"id":"845833","text":"The Constitution of the State of Hawaii () refers to various legal documents throughout the history of the Hawaiian Islands that defined the fundamental principles of authority and governance within its sphere of jurisdiction. Numerous constitutional documents have been promulgated for the Kingdom of Hawaii, Republic of Hawaii, Territory of Hawaii and State of Hawaii. The first constitution was drafted by Kamehameha III. A few notable constitutions are the Bayonet Constitution of 1887 which stripped King Kalakaua of some decision making abilities without concurrence of his cabinet, and the Proposed 1893 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii, a replacement of the Bayonet Constitution promulgated by Queen Liliuokalani, which set off a chain of events that eventually resulted in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Other notable documents include the Constitution of 1978 that created the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and declared the Hawaiian language to be one of the official languages of the state. ==List of constitutions== *1840 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii *1852 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii *1864 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii *1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii *1893 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii *1894 Constitution of the Republic of Hawaii *1950 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention *1959 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention *1968 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention *1978 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention ==Preamble== The current version of the Constitution of Hawaii features a preamble that states, \\"We, the people of the State of Hawaii, grateful for Divine Guidance, and mindful of our Hawaiian heritage, reaffirm our belief in a government of the people, by the people and for the people, and with an understanding heart toward all peoples of the earth do hereby ordain and establish this constitution for the State of Hawaii.\\" ==Bill of Rights== The preamble is followed by a twenty-point bill of rights: #All political power of this State is inherent in the people; and the responsibility for the exercise thereof rests with the people.

His combination of squeezed tomatoes, sugar and his special sauce became an instant success as Chicago businessmen spread the word about the tomato juice cocktail.Anne Hattes. \\"Tomato Juice\\". Relish, August 2009. ==Production== Many commercial manufacturers of tomato juice also add salt. Other ingredients are also often added, such as onion powder, garlic powder, and other spices. In the United States, mass-produced tomato juice began to be marketed in the mid 1920s, and became a popular breakfast drink a few years thereafter. In the United States, most tomato juice is made from tomato paste. In Canada, tomato juice is unconcentrated and pasteurized, made from fine tomato pulp from ripe and whole tomatoes. The stems and skins must be removed without adding water to the final juice product. It may also contain a sweetening agent, citric acid and salt. ==Uses== Tomato juice with other ingredients found in Bloody Mary mix In Canada and Mexico, tomato juice is commonly mixed with beer; the concoction is known in Canada as Calgary Red- Eye, and in Mexico as Cerveza preparada. Tomato juice is the base for the cocktails Bloody Mary and Bloody Caesar, and the cocktail mixer Clamato. In the UK tomato juice is commonly combined with Worcestershire sauce. Chilled tomato juice was formerly popular as an appetizer at restaurants in the United States. Tomato juice is frequently used as a packing liquid for canned tomatoes, though it is sometimes replaced by tomato pur√©e for international commerce due to tariff issues on vegetables vs. sauces. According to Cook's Illustrated magazine, tomatoes packed in juice as opposed to pur√©e tend to win taste tests, being perceived as fresher tasting. Tomato juice is used in the preparation of tomato juice agar, used to culture various species of Lactobacillus. Tomato juice is a popular drink among airplane passengers. A small study by Yan and Dando hints that this is due to an increased perception of umami flavor while in the loud and pressurized environment of the cabin. An alternative explanation is that it has become tradition similar to eating popcorn at the cinema. ==See also== * Juicing * List of juices * V8 == References == Category:Fruit juice Category:Tomato products Category:Ohio culture Category:Mexican drinks Category:Symbols of Ohio ","title":"Tomato juice"},{"id":"845849","text":"jEdit is a free software text editor available under the GNU General Public License version 2.0. It is written in Java and runs on any operating system with Java support, including BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows. ==Development== jEdit development was started in 1998 by Slava Pestov, who left the project in 2006, handing development to the free software community. ==Features== jEdit includes syntax highlighting that provides native support for over 200 file formats. Support for additional formats can be added manually using XML files. It supports UTF-8 and many other encodings. It has extensive code folding and text folding capabilities as well as text wrapping that takes indents into account. The application is highly customizable and can be extended with macros written in BeanShell, Jython, JavaScript and some other scripting languages. ===Plug-ins=== There are over 150 available jEdit plug-ins for many different application areas. Plug-ins are used to customize the application for individual use and can make it into an advanced XML/HTML editor, or an integrated development environment (IDE), with compiler, code completion, context-sensitive help, debugging, visual differentiation and language- specific tools. The plug-ins are downloaded via an integrated plug-in manager which finds and installs them along with any dependencies. The plugin manager will track new versions and can download associated updates automatically. Some available plug-ins include: * Spell checker using Aspell * Syntax and style checkers for various languages * Text auto-complete * Accents plugin that converts character abbreviations for accented characters as they are typed. * XML plugin that is used for editing XML, HTML, JavaScript and CSS files. In the case of XML, the plug-in does validation. For XML, HTML and CSS, it uses auto-completion popups for elements, attributes and entities. ==Reception== In general jEdit has received positive reviews from developers. Rob Griffiths wrote in April 2002 for MAC OS X HINTS saying he was \\"very impressed\\" and naming it \\"pick of the week\\". He cited its file memory upon reopening, its ability to notice if an open file was changed on disk by another program, syntax coloring, including that users can create their own colour schemes, split windows feature, show line number feature, convertible tabs to soft-tabs and view sidebars. He also praised its customization possibilities using the extensive preferences panel and the \\"on the fly\\" search engine, which searches while typing. Griffiths noted that the application has a few drawbacks, such as that it is \\"a bit slow at scrolling a line at a time\\" and that because it is a Java application it doesn't have the full Aqua interface. Also reviewing the application in April 2002, Daniel Steinberg writing for O'Reilly Media said \\"The strength of jEdit for Java developers comes from the plug-ins contributed by the community...For the most part, there's nothing here that couldn't be done with BBEdit or even with Emacs or vi. jEdit packages the capabilities much more nicely and makes it easy to call often-used functionality using the plug-ins. Where I saw NetBeans as overkill, others may see jEdit as underkill for an IDE or overkill for a text editor. I find it Mac friendly and easy to use. I don't expect too much from it, so I tend to be pleased with what I get.\\" Scott Beatty reviewing jEdit on SitePoint in 2005 particularly noted the application's folding feature along with its search and replace and PHP syntax highlighting capabilities. He recommended the use of the PHPParser plug-in. PHPParser is a sidebar that checks for PHP syntax errors whenever a PHP code file is loaded or saved. He noted that downloading jEdit is simple, but that getting and installing the plug-ins to customize it for individual use can be a complex process: \\"Beware that a full setup requires a series of downloads, and that this process can take time.\\" Writing in December 2011, reviewer Rares Aioanei praised jEdit's versatility, stating \\"jEdit's design allows you to use it as a simple editor, but also use it as an IDE and expand its functionality via plugins so that it becomes exactly what you want it to be for the task or language at hand.\\" but also adding that \\"jEdit is not, however, an IDE with everything but the Christmas tree, like Eclipse or Microsoft Visual Studio. Rather, it's a compact application for editing code, providing practical tools along with basic IDE features.\\" ==See also== * FeatherPad * gedit * List of text editors * Comparison of text editors ==References== ==External links== * Category:Free text editors Category:Windows text editors Category:Java platform software Category:MacOS text editors Category:1998 software Category:Free software programmed in Java (programming language) Category:Free HTML editors Category:Linux text editors Category:Software using the GPL license ","title":"JEdit"},{"id":"845861","text":"Thomas Dadford Sr. (died 1809) was an English canal engineer as were his sons, Thomas Dadford Jr., John Dadford, and James Dadford. ==Biography== Thomas Dadford probably originated from Stewponey or Stourton, Staffordshire near Stourbridge.

Scholars have suspected it to have been either smallpoxH. Haeser's conclusion, in Lehrbuch der Geschichte der Medicin und der epidemischen Krankenheiten III:24‚Äì33 (1882), followed by Zinsser in 1935. or measles.\\"There is not enough evidence satisfactorily to identify the disease or diseases\\", concluded J. F. Gilliam in his summary (1961) of the written sources, with inconclusive Greek and Latin inscriptions, two groups of papyri and coinage.The most recent scientific data have eliminated that possibility. See The plague may have claimed the life of a Roman emperor, Lucius Verus, who died in 169 and was the co-regent of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, whose family name, Antoninus, has become associated with the pandemic. Ancient sources agree that the plague appeared first during the Roman siege of the Mesopotamian city Seleucia in the winter of 165‚Äì166. Ammianus Marcellinus reported that the plague spread to Gaul and to the legions along the Rhine. Eutropius stated that a large population died throughout the empire.Eutropius XXXI, 6.24. According to the contemporary Roman historian Cassius Dio, the disease broke out again nine years later in 189 AD and caused up to 2,000 deaths a day in Rome, one quarter of those who were affected.Dio Cassius, LXXII 14.3‚Äì4; his book that would cover the plague under Marcus Aurelius is missing; the later outburst was the greatest of which the historian had knowledge. The total death count has been estimated at 5 million, and the disease killed as much as one third of the population in some areas and devastated the Roman army. Australian sinologist and historian Rafe de Crespigny speculates that the plague may have also broken out in Eastern Han China before 166 because of notices of plagues in Chinese records. The plague affected Roman culture and literature and may have severely affected Indo-Roman trade relations in the Indian Ocean. == Epidemiology == A group of physicians in an image from the Vienna Dioscurides, named after the physician Galen shown at the top centre. In 166, during the epidemic, the Greek physician and writer Galen travelled from Rome to his home in Asia Minor and returned to Rome in 168, when he was summoned by the two Augusti, the co-emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. He was present at the outbreak among troops stationed at Aquileia in the winter of 168/69. Galen briefly recorded observations and a description of the epidemic in the treatise Methodus Medendi, and he scattered other references to it among his voluminous writings. He described the plague as \\"great\\" and of long duration, and mentioned fever, diarrhea, and pharyngitis as well as a skin eruption, sometimes dry and sometimes pustular, that appeared on the ninth day of the illness. The information that was provided by Galen did not clearly define the nature of the disease, but scholars have generally preferred to diagnose it as smallpox.See McLynn, Frank, Marcus Aurelius, Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor, Vintage Books, London, 2009. The historian William H. McNeillMcNeill, W.H. 1976 Plagues and Peoples. New York Anchor Press. asserts that the Antonine Plague and the later Plague of Cyprian (251‚Äìca. 270) were outbreaks of two different diseases, one of smallpox and one of measles but not necessarily in that order. The severe devastation to the European population from the two plagues may indicate that people had no previous exposure to either disease, which brought immunity to survivors. Other historians believe that both outbreaks involved smallpox.D. Ch. Stathakopoulos Famine and Pestilence in the late Roman and early Byzantine Empire (2007) 95 The latter view is bolstered by molecular estimates that place the evolution of measles sometime after 1000 AD. ==Impact== ===Arts=== In their consternation, many turned to the protection offered by magic. Lucian of Samosata's irony-laden account of the charlatan Alexander of Abonoteichus records a verse of his \\"which he despatched to all the nations during the pestilence... was to be seen written over doorways everywhere\\", particularly in the houses that were emptied, Lucian further remarks.Lucian, Alexander, 36. The epidemic had drastic social and political effects throughout the Roman Empire. Barthold Georg Niebuhr (1776‚Äì1831) concluded that \\"as the reign of Marcus Aurelius forms a turning point in so many things, and above all in literature and art, I have no doubt that this crisis was brought about by that plague.... The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted on it by the plague which visited it in the reign of Marcus Aurelius.\\"Niebuhr, Lectures on the history of Rome III, Lecture CXXXI (London 1849), quoted by Gilliam 1961:225 During the Marcomannic Wars, Marcus Aurelius wrote his philosophical work Meditations. A passage (IX.2) states that even the pestilence around him was less deadly than falsehood, evil behaviour and lack of true understanding. As he lay dying, he uttered the words, \\"Weep not for me; think rather of the pestilence and the deaths of so many others.\\" Edward Gibbon (1737‚Äì1794) and Michael Rostovtzeff (1870‚Äì1952) assigned the Antonine plague less influence than contemporary political and economic trends, respectively. ==Military concerns== A Roman coin commemorating the victories of Marcus Aurelius in the Marcomannic Wars against the Germanic tribes along the Danube frontier in the early 170s AD Some direct effects of the contagion stand out. When imperial forces moved east, under the command of Emperor Verus, after the forces of Vologases IV of Parthia attacked Armenia, the Romans' defense of the eastern territories was hampered when large numbers of troops succumbed to the disease. According to the 5th-century Spanish writer Paulus Orosius, many towns and villages in the Italian Peninsula and the European provinces lost all of their inhabitants. As the disease swept north to the Rhine, it also infected Germanic and Gallic peoples outside the empire's borders. For years, those northern groups had pressed south in search of more lands to sustain their growing populations. With their ranks thinned by the epidemic, Roman armies were now unable to push the tribes back. From 167 to his death, Marcus Aurelius personally commanded legions near the Danube, trying, with only partial success, to control the advance of Germanic peoples across the river. A major offensive against the Marcomanni was postponed to 169 because of a shortage of imperial troops. ==Indian Ocean trade and Han China== Although Ge Hong was the first writer of traditional Chinese medicine who accurately described the symptoms of smallpox, the historian Rafe de Crespigny mused that the plagues afflicting the Eastern Han Empire during the reigns of Emperor Huan of Han (r. 146‚Äì168) and Emperor Ling of Han (r. 168‚Äì189) ‚Äì with outbreaks in 151, 161, 171, 173, 179, 182, and 185 ‚Äì were perhaps connected to the Antonine plague on the western end of Eurasia.de Crespigny, Rafe. (2007). A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23‚Äì220 AD). Leiden: Koninklijke Brill, p. 514, . De Crespigny suggests that the plagues led to the rise of the cult faith healing millenarian movement led by Zhang Jue (d. 184), who instigated the disastrous Yellow Turban Rebellion (184‚Äì205).de Crespigny, Rafe. (2007). A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23‚Äì220 AD). Leiden: Koninklijke Brill, pp. 514‚Äì515, . He also stated that \\"it may be only chance\\" that the outbreak of the Antonine plague in 166 coincides with the Roman embassy of \\"Daqin\\" (the Roman Empire) landing in Jiaozhi (northern Vietnam) and visiting the Han court of Emperor Huan, claiming to represent \\"Andun\\" (; a transliteration of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus or his predecessor Antoninus Pius).de Crespigny, Rafe. (2007). A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23‚Äì220 AD). Leiden: Koninklijke Brill, p. 600, .See also See also: Hill, John E. (2009). Through the Jade Gate to Rome: A Study of the Silk Routes during the Later Han Dynasty, First to Second Centuries CE. BookSurge. , p. 27. Raoul McLaughlin wrote that the Roman subjects visiting the Han Chinese court in 166 could have ushered in a new era of Roman Far East trade, but it was a \\"harbinger of something much more ominous\\" instead.Raoul McLaughlin (2010), Rome and the Distant East: Trade Routes to the Ancient Lands of Arabia, India, and China, London & New York: Continuum, , p. 59. McLaughlin surmised that the origins of the plague lay in Central Asia, from some unknown and isolated population group, which then spread to the Chinese and the Roman worlds. The plague would kill roughly 10% of the Roman population, as cited by McLaughlin, causing \\"irreparable\\" damage to the Roman maritime trade in the Indian Ocean as proven by the archaeological record spanning from Egypt to India as well as significantly decreased Roman commercial activity in Southeast Asia.Raoul McLaughlin (2010), Rome and the Distant East: Trade Routes to the Ancient Lands of Arabia, India, and China, London & New York: Continuum, , pp. 59‚Äì60. However, as evidenced by the 3rd- century Periplus of the Erythraean Sea and the 6th-century Christian Topography by Cosmas Indicopleustes, Roman maritime trade into the Indian Ocean, particularly in the silk and spice trades, certainly did not cease but continued until the loss of Egypt to the Muslim Rashidun Caliphate.Yule, Henry (1915).

This article details the order of battle of German military units during the invasion of Poland in 1939. The German army's forces for the invasion of Poland with the codename Fall Weiss (English - Case White) were divided into Army Group North (consisting of the German 3rd and 4th armies) and Army Group South (consisting of the German 8th, 10th, and 14th armies, and the Slovak Army Group Bernolak). Army Group C was on the western border of Germany defending against a potential French attack. This Order of Battle is for 0447 on September 1, after which things started to get shuffled.e.g. Kampfgeschwader 27 of Luftflotte 2, on the west side of Germany, was transferred to Luftflotte 1, on the east side of Germany, by noon of the first day. == Oberkommando des Heeres == Oberkommando des Heeres was the High Command of the Heer. It controlled everything related to the Heer: Personnel, Training, Recruitment, Armaments, Transportation, Supplies, Medical Services, etc. An ongoing problem was that each service branch was its own \\"kingdom\\" resulting in massive inefficiency. Oberbefehlshaber des Heeres - Generaloberst Walter von Brauchitsch * Chef des Generalstab des Heeres - General der Artillerie Franz Halder, the Chief of the General Staff of the Army was the head of all of the departments of the Heer except for the armaments section and the replacement army. * Chef der Heeresr√ºstung und Befehlshaber des Ersatzheeres - General der Artillerie Friedrich ‚ÄúFritz‚Äù Fromm, who was the Chief of Armaments and Commander of the Replacement Army. He controlled all army procurement and production, and all of the troops within Germany who were replacements for front line units. == Heeresgruppe NordOn September 1 Heeresgruppe Nord & Heeresgruppe S√ºd were named 2. Armee & 12\\\\. Armee respectively. They were renamed on September 2. They were later renamed Heeresgruppe B & Heeresgruppe A respectively.== Heeresgruppe Nord was commanded by Generaloberst Fedor von Bock. Its initial objectives were to capture the \\"Polish corridor\\" (4th Army) and drive southwards towards Warsaw from East Prussia (3rd Army). ===Army Group Reserve Troops=== Directly subordinated to Heeresgruppe Nord were: *10.

His father was a canal engineer, and his brothers John Dadford and James Dadford also worked in this field. Thomas received his early training from his father. On 15 August 1797, he married Ann Parker of Chaddesley Corbett, Worcestershire. Both were Christians of the Catholic faith. They had no children. The marriage did not last long, as Thomas died on 2 April 1801. He died at Crickhowell, and was buried at Llanarth, Monmouthshire. The cause of his death is not known.Prof A W Skempton (Ed) (2002) A Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineers In Gt Britain, Thomas Telford Publishers, When he died, he left no will, but his wife obtained letters of administration in her favour; and his \\"goods, chattels and credits\\" amounted to ¬£2,000. ==Working history== His father was the engineer for the Stourbridge Canal, and from 1776 Thomas assisted him. However, he was dismissed in the following year. In 1782 he assisted his father again, with a survey of the River Trent, which was to be improved for navigation. His next project, from 1790, was the construction of the Glamorganshire Canal, where he worked with his father and with Thomas Sheasby. In 1790 he assisted his father and brother John with a survey for the fledgling Neath Canal Company. The following year he became the engineer for the Neath Canal, and also became surveyor and engineer for the Leominster Canal, a position which he held until 1795, simultaneously with his other projects. Dadford's aqueduct at Brynich carries the Brecon and Abergavenny Canal over the River Usk He supervised the construction of the Neath Canal from Neath to Ynysbwllog, where the canal was to cross the River Neath by an aqueduct; but in 1792 he resigned before the project was completed, in order to become engineer for the Monmouthshire Canal. He was contracted to devote three-quarters of his time to the canal, the main line of which was completed by 1796, and the remaining quarter enabled him to fulfill his obligation on the Leominster Canal. In addition to the canal, he supervised construction of five tramways for the canal company, which connected to quarries, ironworks and collieries, and an independent tramway, the Trevil Rail Road. The Monmouthshire Canal Company also asked him to survey the southern section of the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal, with a view to finding a high level route which would result in most of the canal being lock-free. This he did and the route was adopted. He retained his position as engineer to the Monmouthshire Canal until late 1798. From 1794 he assisted his brother John, who was engineer on the Montgomeryshire Canal. He was criticized by that company for his lack of attendance, but still managed to be the contractor for one section in 1795 and 1796, and to inspect and report on the final route with his father in 1797. From January 1796 he was engineer for the Monmouthshire & Brecon Canal, devoting one quarter of his time to this task, and was still acting in this capacity when he died. His workload was prodigious, as he managed to fit in surveys for the Ellesmere Canal in 1793, a survey for the extension of the Neath Canal from Neath to Giant's Grave in 1798, and a new survey of the proposed route for the Aberdare Canal in 1800, amongst others. ==Achievements== During his brief working life Thomas Dadford Jr. managed to achieve a great deal. Major structures for which he was responsible include the fourteen locks on the Monmouthshire Canal at Rogerstone, the embankment at Gilwern which enables the Brecon and Abergavenny Canal to cross the River Clydach and a four-arched stone-built aqueduct which carries the same canal over the River Usk at Brynich. He had less success with tunnels. The Southnet Tunnel on the Leominster Canal collapsed in 1795 (for which he was criticized by the engineer John Rennie), and the Ashford tunnel on the Brecon and Abergavenny Canal collapsed during construction. ==See also== *Canals of the United Kingdom *History of the British canal system ==References== ==Further reading== *Edward Paget-Tomlison's \\"Illustrated History of Canals & River Navigations\\" Category:Engineers from the West Midlands (county) Category:English canal engineers Category:1760s births Category:1801 deaths ","title":"Thomas Dadford Jr."},{"id":"845879","text":"Storsj√∂n (, lit. \\"The Great Lake\\") is the fifth largest lake in Sweden, with an area of and a greatest depth of .

He was the mentor, boyfriend and murderer of playwright Joe Orton. == Childhood == Halliwell was born in Bebington. He was very close to his mother; when he was 11, he witnessed her death from a wasp sting at the family home. Halliwell was a classics scholar at Wirral Grammar School, where he gained his Higher School Certificate in 1943. Eligible for military service in 1944, he registered as a conscientious objector, and was exempted conditional upon becoming a coal miner. After discharge in 1946, he acted for a time in Scotland and then returned home to act in Birkenhead. His father committed suicide in 1949 by putting his head in a gas oven; Halliwell was the first to find the body the following morning. Afterward, Halliwell moved to London to study drama at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), having inherited the family fortune. == Relationship with Orton == In 1951, he met Joe Orton, a fellow RADA student. Both men were struggling actors who became struggling writers. However, their common interests led to a lengthy romantic relationship. Halliwell, in the early years, seems to have been something of a mentor to Orton, who had had a rather cursory education, and helped to mould the writing style that would later be called \\"Ortonesque\\". The two men collaborated on several novels, including The Boy Hairdresser, which were not published until after their deaths. From January 1959, Orton and Halliwell were involved in the theft and defacement of public library books. Halliwell became an illicit collage artist, while Orton wrote the fake blurbs for the flyleaf of the dust jackets. After their trial in 1962 the two men were given custodial sentences, Halliwell was sent to HM Prison Ford in Sussex for six months; Orton went to Eastchurch in Kent. Orton's eventual success as a writer, which began not long after their release from prison, put a distance between the two men that Halliwell found difficult to handle. Towards the end of his life, Halliwell was on regular courses of anti-depressants. == Murder- suicide == On 9 August 1967 Halliwell fatally injured Orton with nine hammer blows to the head and then overdosed on pentobarbital (Nembutal) sleeping pills. Halliwell died first. Their bodies were discovered late the following morning, when a chauffeur arrived at the door of their Noel Road flat in Islington to collect Orton for a meeting with director Richard Lester to discuss filming options on Up Against It, an unproduced script by Orton, written in 1967 for The Beatles. Halliwell's suicide note referred to the contents of Orton's diary as an explanation for his actions: > If you read his diary, all will be explained. KH PS: Especially the latter > part. This is presumed to be a reference to Orton's description of his promiscuity; the diary contains numerous incidents of cottaging in public lavatories and other casual sexual encounters. == In popular culture == In Prick Up Your Ears, the 1987 film based on Orton's life, Halliwell was portrayed by Alfred Molina. In Fantabulosa!, the 2006 television play about Kenneth Williams, he was portrayed by Ewan Bailey.https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074s9v British experimental music group Coil recorded three tracks titled \\"The Halliwell Hammers\\" for their 1995 album Worship the Glitch. The two primary members of Coil, John Balance and Peter Christopherson, were romantic partners through most of the band's existence, and much of their work was inspired by or dedicated to gay icons and personalities of the past. Halliwell is the subject of a monologue, Especially The Latter Part, by Richard Ely. It was premiered in Lichfield in 2009. The stage version of Prick Up Your Ears, written by Simon Bent, opened on the West End in London at the Royal Theatre on 17 September 2009. Matt Lucas played Halliwell and Chris New played Orton. Con O'Neill took over the role of Halliwell after Lucas pulled out. The play closed on 15 November 2009. In 2014, a collage by Halliwell was purchased by Islington Museum at auction for ¬£2,800.

As a member of the French Historical School of economics, \\"French Historical School\\", New School, History of Economic Thought (on line) Simiand predicated a rigorous factual and statistical basis for theoretical models and policies. His contribution to French social science was recognized in 1931 when, at the age of 58, he was elected to the faculty of the Coll√®ge de France and accepted the chair in labor history. Simiand's career was unusual. Like many destined to become influential academics in France, he entered the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure and graduated in philosophy at the top of his class in 1896. However, he quickly became interested in law and economics and submitted a thesis on the wages of coal miners in France (1904) to the faculty of law rather than becoming an academic. As a result, he foreclosed forever the possibility of a prominent university appointment. Thus in 1901 he became the librarian for the French Ministries of Commerce and Labor, a post he held until the outbreak of World War I. From 1910 on he also taught Economic History at the √âcole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, an institution which did not require a doctorate from its lecturers. Toward the end of the nineteenth century Simiand joined the editorial board of the Ann√©e Sociologique. He became a central member of the group as editor of the economic sociology section and served as its expert on statistics. At the same time, as someone removed from the politics of French academics, he was at an institutional remove from √âmile Durkheim's ambitions for transforming the French university. Simiand moved further into the administrative apparatus of the French state during World War I when he left his position as a librarian for work in the Ministry of Armaments where he played a prominent role in making policy. After the war, he served for a year as the Director of Labor for the province of Alsace-Lorraine. In addition, he took up a more permanent position as a teacher at the Conservatoire National des Arts et M√©tiers. A student of Henri Bergson and √âmile Durkheim, Simiand advanced a view of economics as a social science grounded in observable phenomena rather than convenient assumptions. This would imply a large program of historical and statistical research. Joseph Schumpeter, who denied the existence of a French or an Italian Historical School despite the historical current evident in their economics, acknowledged the significance of Simiand's contributions. In Schumpeter's view, Simiand should be considered a French Institutionalist.Joseph A. Schumpeter, History of Economic Analysis, New York, Oxford U. Press, 1954, p. 820.

He had one older brother, Jan (Johannes Simon). Simon did not turn out to be a very bright student and he left secondary school in 1929. He enjoyed working as an editor for the school paper though, and he was determined to become a journalist. After various editorial jobs, he became a reporter for the socialist newspaper Het Volk (The People). Later on he worked for the same paper as a drama critic. He also wrote short columns about daily life in The Hague, which he called Kleinigheden (Trifles). In 1939 Simon married Tiny de Goey. A year later she gave birth to a daughter, Marianne. In the same year the first collection of Kleinigheden was published, named Vijftig dwaasheden (Fifty follies). When the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940 and Het Volk was taken over and censored, Carmiggelt resigned from the paper. During the war he had all sorts of small jobs, but he secretly got in touch with the Dutch resistance and worked for the underground newspaper Het Parool. He was responsible for the lay-out and printing of the paper. He also wrote a few stories for Het Parool. In 1943 Simon's brother Jan was arrested by the Germans for aiding persons in hiding. He was taken to Herzogenbusch concentration camp, where he died of exhaustion on 26 September 1943. Jan's death was to change the rest of Simon's life; he would never fully overcome the trauma it caused. After the war he again started to write columns for Het Parool. He signed them as 'Kronkel' (Twist, Kink). His Kronkels became very famous for their melancholic, sometimes sombre tone and the ironic use of formal language. Many columns were about unsuccessful, disillusioned people in cafes and bars (often in Amsterdam, where he then lived), who told the writer about their lives. But Carmiggelt also wrote about his children and later his grandchildren, his cats and other small events in his life. His work became very popular and he received various Dutch literary prizes. Together with the Dutch Indo author and essayist Tjalie Robinson he is credited with establishing a whole new genre in Dutch literature that found successors like Rudy Kousbroek.Buikema, Rosemarie and Meijer, Maaike (red.), Cultuur en migratie in Nederland.

She wrote a book about this, titled Mijn beter ik (My better self), which was published when both she and Simon had died. Simon Carmiggelt's last Kronkel was published in 1983. On 30 November 1987 he died of a heart attack. A year after his death, a statue of Carmiggelt (made by Kees Verkade) was placed near his former house in Amsterdam and one of him and his wife on a park bench near his summer house in De Steeg (Rheden). This last statue was stolen in the weekend of 21 January 2012. It was retrieved on 25 January, sawn into many pieces.

Parke's Civil War service was closely associated with Ambrose E. Burnside, often serving him as chief of staff in major engagements such as Antietam, Fredericksburg and the Overland Campaign. Parke also held significant field commands during Burnside's North Carolina Expedition, Vicksburg and the battle of Fort Stedman as well as brief stints in command of the Army of the Potomac. ==Early life== Parke was born in Coatesville, Chester County, Pennsylvania, to Francis G. and Sarah Parke. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1849 and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers. As an engineer, he determined the boundary lines between Iowa and the Little Colorado River, surveyed routes for a railroad from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, and was the chief surveyor of the party charged with the delineation of the boundary of the northwest United States and British North America, 1857‚Äì1861. ==Civil War== At the start of the Civil War, Parke was appointed brigadier general of volunteers and commanded a brigade in the operations on the North Carolina coast in early 1862. He received a brevet promotion for the Battle of Fort Macon and was promoted to major general of volunteers on July 18, 1862. In the Army of the Potomac, Parke served briefly as commander of 3rd Division, IX Corps. Then he served as chief of staff to Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside during the battles of Antietam and Fredericksburg. He assumed command of the IX Corps and was sent to the Western Theater for the Vicksburg Campaign. Parke then was Burnside's chief of staff in the Army of the Ohio in the defense of Knoxville. Parke served as chief of staff to Burnside during the Overland Campaign, in which the latter commanded IX Corps, as well as in the beginning stages of the Siege of Petersburg. After the Battle of the Crater, Burnside was relieved of command and Parke assumed command of the IX Corps. He led it at the Battle of Globe Tavern, the Battle of Peebles' Farm, and the Battle of Boydton Plank Road. In 1865, while Army of the Potomac commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade was in a conference, Parke, being senior officer, was acting commander of the army during the Battle of Fort Stedman until Meade returned to the field. He led the IX Corps through the fall of Petersburg and the Appomattox Campaign. In 1865 he was appointed brevet major general in the regular army in recognition of his service at Fort Stedman. ==Postbellum career== After the Confederate surrender, Parke commanded IX Corps in the Department of Washington. He also briefly commanded XXII Corps. Parke was mustered out of the volunteer service on January 15, 1866. He served as an engineer, being promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel on March 4, 1879. Parke attained the rank of colonel on March 17, 1884. He served as superintendent of the United States Military Academy from August 28, 1887, to June 24, 1889, and he retired from the Army on July 2 of that year.

Knaphus, located on Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah The Mormon pioneers were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), also known as Latter-day Saints, who migrated in the mid-1840s across the United States from the Midwest to the Salt Lake Valley in what is today the U.S. state of Utah. At the time of the planning of the exodus in 1846, the territory was owned by the Republic of Mexico, which soon after went to war with the United States over the annexation of Texas. The Salt Lake Valley became American territory as a result of this war. The journey was taken by about 70,000 people beginning with advance parties sent out by church leaders in March 1846 after the 1844 death of the church's leader Joseph Smith made it clear that the group could not remain in Nauvoo, Illinoiswhich the church had recently purchased, improved, renamed, and developed because of the Missouri Mormon War, setting off the Illinois Mormon War. The well-organized wagon train migration began in earnest in April 1847, and the period (including the flight from Missouri in 1838 to Nauvoo), known as the Mormon Exodus is, by convention among social scientists, traditionally assumed to have ended with the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. Not everyone could afford to transport a family by railroad, and the transcontinental railroad network only serviced limited main routes, so wagon train migrations to the far west continued sporadically until the 20th century. ==Background of the migration== Map showing the westward exodus of the LDS Church between 1846 and 1869. Also shown are a portion of the route followed by the Mormon Battalion and the path followed by the handcart companies to the Mormon Trail. Since its founding in 1830, members of the LDS Church were often harshly treated by their neighbors, partially due to their religious beliefs, sometimes as a reaction against the actions and the words of the church leaders and members. These and other reasons caused the body of the church to move from one place to another‚Äîto Ohio, Missouri, and then to Illinois, where they built the city of Nauvoo. Sidney Rigdon was the First Counselor in the church's First Presidency, and as its spokesman, Rigdon preached several controversial sermons in Missouri, including the Salt Sermon and the July 4th Oration.Oration Delivered by Mr. S. Rigdon on the 4th of July at Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri, 1838 These speeches have sometimes been seen as contributing to the conflict known as the 1838 Mormon War in Missouri. As a result of the conflict, the Mormons were expelled from the state by Governor Boggs, and Rigdon and Smith were arrested and imprisoned in Liberty Jail. Rigdon was released on a writ of habeas corpus and made his way to Illinois, where he joined the main body of Mormon refugees in 1839. In 1844, Smith, and his brother, Hyrum, were killed by a mob while in custody in the city of Carthage, Illinois. In 1846, religious tensions reached their peak, and in 1848 mobs burned the Latter-day Saint temple in Nauvoo. According to church belief, God inspired Brigham Young (Joseph Smith's successor as church president) to call for the Saints (as church members call themselves) to organize and head West, beyond the western frontier of the United States (into what was then Mexico, though the U.S. Army had already captured Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico and the colonized parts of Alta California in late 1846). During the winter of 1846‚Äì47, Latter-day Saint leaders in Winter Quarters and Iowa laid plans for the migration of the large number of Saints, their equipment, and their livestock. It was here that Young first met Thomas L. Kane, a non-Mormon from Philadelphia with deep personal connections to the Polk administration. Kane obtained permission for the Mormons to winter on Indian territory, and the site was originally called Kanesville. Young continued to trust Kane throughout his own lifetime, particularly as an intermediary with the often hostile Federal government. This major undertaking was a significant test of leadership capability and the existing administrative network of the recently restructured church. For his role in the migration, Brigham Young is sometimes referred to as the \\"American Moses.\\" Young personally reviewed all available information on the Salt Lake Valley and the Great Basin, consulting with mountain men and trappers who traveled through Winter Quarters, and meeting with Father Pierre-Jean De Smet, a Jesuit missionary familiar with the Great Basin. The wary Young insisted the Mormons should settle in a location no other colonizers wanted, and felt the Salt Lake Valley met that requirement but would provide the Saints with many advantages as well. ==Vanguard company of 1847== Young organized a vanguard company to break the trail west to the Rocky Mountains, gather information about trail conditions, including water sources and Native American tribes, and to ultimately select the central gathering point in the Great Basin. The initial company would select and break the primary trail with the expectation that later pioneers would maintain and improve it. It was hoped that the group could, wherever possible, establish fords and ferries and plant crops for later harvest. In late February, plans were made to gather portable boats, maps, scientific instruments, farm implements and seeds. Techniques for irrigating crops were investigated. A new route on the north side of the Platte River was chosen to avoid major interaction with travelers using the established Oregon Trail on the river's south side. Given the needs of the large volume of Saints who would travel west, church leaders decided to avoid potential conflicts over grazing rights, water access and campsites. Winter Quarters In April 1847, Young consulted with members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles who had recently returned from the British mission. John Taylor, Parley P. Pratt and Orson Hyde brought money contributed by the English Saints, a map based on John C. Fremont's recent western expedition, and instruments for calculating latitude, elevation, temperature and barometric pressure. Chosen members of the vanguard group were gathered together, final supplies were packed, and the group was organized into military companies. The group consisted of 143 men, including three enslaved African-American men Dockstader, Julie A. \\"With the Just We Shall Dwell\\", Pioneer Magazine, National Society of the Sons of Utah Pioneers, 01 March 1996. Retrieved on 21 June 2020. and eight members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, three women, and two children. The train contained 73 wagons, one cannon, 93 horses, 52 mules, 66 oxen, 19 cows, 17 dogs and some chickens, and carried enough supplies to fully provision the group for one year. Young divided this group into 14 companies, each with a designated captain. Apprehensive of possible danger posed by Native Americans, a militia and night guard was formed under the direction of Stephen Markham. Pioneers Crossing the Plains of Nebraska On April 5, 1847, at 2 p.m., the wagon train moved west from Winter Quarters toward the Great Basin. With the afternoon start, they made three miles (5 km) and camped in a line a few hundred yards from a stand of timber. Journal records show that Young actively managed the journey, supervising details and occasionally giving reprimands when evening and Sunday recreation became rowdy or group members failed to complete their tasks. On one occasion, he chastised the camp's hunters for being wasteful of flesh ... killing more than was really needed. May, Dean L. Utah: A People's History p. 57. Bonneville Books, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1987. . Camp was awakened by a bugle at 5 a.m. and the company was expected to be prepared for travel by 7 a.m.. Each day's travel ended at 8:30 p.m. and the camp was in bed by 9 p.m.. The company traveled six days during the week, but generally stayed in camp on Sunday to observe the Sabbath. Some camp members were assigned specific tasks. William Clayton was appointed company scribe and was expected to record an accurate description of their journey and the distance they traveled each day. After three weeks, Clayton grew tired of personally counting the revolutions of a wagon wheel and computing the day's distance by multiplying the count by the wheel's circumference. After consulting with Orson Pratt, an accomplished mathematician, he designed a mechanism consisting of a set of wooden cog wheels attached to the hub of a wagon wheel, with the mechanism \\"counting\\" or recording by position the revolutions of the wheel. Clayton's design, which he called the roadometer, is the basis for most modern odometers. The apparatus was built to Clayton and Pratt's specifications by the company's carpenter, Appleton Milo Harmon, and was first used on the morning of May 12, 1847. The roadometer showed that the company averaged between fourteen and twenty miles per day. Apostle Orson Pratt was named the company's scientific observer. He made regular readings on scientific instruments, took notes on geological formations and mineral resources, and described plants and animals. Journals kept by both Clayton and Pratt have become valuable resources for historians of the Mormon trek west. Women of the company also performed vital tasks along the way. While much time was spent on traditional activities such as cooking, sewing, and tending children, several women served as scribes and diary keepers. Harriet Page Young, wife of Lorenzo Young, was the first woman selected for the company. She was in ill health and Lorenzo Young feared to leave her and their young children behind. The other original women of the company, Ellen Sanders Kimball, wife of Heber C. Kimball, and Clarissa Decker Young, wife of Brigham Young, were asked to accompany the group to look after Harriet Young and keep her company. The three women were joined by a larger group of women church members from Mississippi who merged with the main party at Laramie, Wyoming. Entering the Great Salt Lake Valley The first segment of the journey, from Winter Quarters to Fort Laramie, took six weeks, with the company arriving at the fort on June 1. The company halted for repairs and to reshoe the draft animals. While at Fort Laramie, the vanguard company was joined by members of the Mormon Battalion who had been excused from service due to illness and sent to winter in Pueblo, Colorado. Also traveling in the new group were church members from Mississippi who had taken a more southern route toward the Great Basin. At this point, the now larger company took the established Oregon Trail toward the trading post at Ft. Bridger. At a difficult crossing of the Platte, just before encountering the Sweetwater River, the company made use of their portable boat and were able to cross with comparative ease. Seizing the opportunity to both help future travelers and increase the cash available to the migration, nine men under the direction of Thomas Grover were left behind to construct and operate a ferry at that location. Missourians and other travellers at the river paid the Saints $1.50 or more per wagon to help them cross. During the last week of June, Sam Brannan, leader of the Mormon emigrant ship Brooklyn, met the company near Green River, Wyoming. He reported to Young about his group's successful journey and their settlement in what is today San Francisco, California. He urged the vanguard company to continue on to California but was unable to shift the leader's focus away from the Great Basin. Young also met mountain man Jim Bridger on June 28. They discussed possible routes into the Salt Lake Valley, and the feasibility of viable settlements in the mountain valleys of the Great Basin. Bridger was enthusiastic about settlement near Utah Lake, reporting fish, wild fruit, timber and good grazing. He told Young that local Indians raised good crops, including corn and pumpkins, but that there was ever-present danger of frost. The company pushed on through South Pass, rafted across the Green River and arrived at Fort Bridger on July 7. About the same time, they were joined by thirteen more members of the sick detachment of the Mormon Battalion. The vanguard company now faced a more rugged and hazardous journey, and were concerned about negotiating the passes of the Rocky Mountains. They had received conflicting advice, but Young chose to follow the trail used by the Donner-Reed party on their journey to California the previous year. Shortly after leaving Fort Bridger, the group met trapper Miles Goodyear, who owned a trading post at the mouth of the Weber River. He was enthusiastic about the agricultural potential of the large Weber Valley. During the trip through the rugged mountains, the vanguard company divided into three sections. After crossing the Green River, several members of the party suffered from \\"mountain fever\\" (probably Colorado tick fever, which is carried by the Rocky Mountain wood tick). Young himself became ill soon after meeting Goodyear. The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move ahead on the designated route. In July 1847, the first company reached the Salt Lake Valley, with scouts Erastus Snow and Orson Pratt entering the valley on July 21. Pratt wrote: ...we could not refrain from a shout of joy, which almost involuntarily escaped from our lips the moment this grand and lovely scenery was within our view. The two scouts undertook a twelve-mile (19 km) exploratory circuit into the valley before returning to the larger party. The next day, larger segments of the valley were explored, streams and hot springs investigated and the first camp established in the Salt Lake Valley. On July 23, Pratt offered a prayer dedicating the land to the Lord. Ground was broken, irrigation ditches were dug, and the first fields of potatoes and turnips were planted. On July 24, Young first saw the valley from a \\"sick\\" wagon driven by his friend, Wilford Woodruff. According to Woodruff, Young expressed his satisfaction in the appearance of the valley and declared \\"This is the right place, drive on.\\" Today a monument stands in the spot where he made this declaration. Young later reported that he had seen the valley, including Ensign Peak, in a vision and recognized the spot. On July 28, Young established a location for the future Salt Lake Temple and presented a city plan to the larger group for their approval. In August 1847, Young and other selected members of the vanguard company returned to Winter Quarters. By December 1847, more than two thousand Mormons had completed the journey to the Salt Lake Valley. Several hundred, including Young, returned east to gather and organize the companies scheduled for following years. Demographic estimates place 1,611 pioneers in the valley of the Great Salt Lake during the winter of 1847. The adult labor force, however, was quite small as a high percentage of the group, 53.2 percent were under the age of nineteen. Twenty five percent of the total were children under the age of eight.Walker and Dant, p. 318 Each year during the Mormon migration, people continued to be organized into \\"companies\\", each company bearing the name of its leader. The company was further divided into groups of 10 and 50 with authority and responsibility delegated downward. ==Travel conditions== The pioneers traveled to the Salt Lake Valley in the Great Basin using mainly large farm wagons, handcarts, and, in some cases, personally carrying their belongings.According to the American Studies researchers involved with the Oregon Trail II game, such wagons had a cargo capacity of about 3,000 pounds and weighed another thousand themselves. Their trail along the north bank of the Platte River and North Platte River and over the continental divide climbing up to South Pass and Pacific Springs from Fort John along the valley of the Sweetwater River, then down to Fort Bridger and thence down to the Great Salt Lake became known as the Mormon Trail. Financial resources of the church members varied, with many families suffering from the loss of land and personal possessions in Missouri, and Illinois. This impacted the resources and supplies each family could draw upon as they covered the more than to the Great Basin. Church funds were also limited at this time, but church leaders provided what funding and other material assistance they could to families and companies which were undersupplied. Covered wagons pulled by oxen were common, particularly in the early American companies. In October 1845, as church members were preparing to leave Nauvoo, the Nauvoo Neighbor printed an extensive list of suggested provisions for each family wagon. The provisions included two to three yoke of oxen, two milk cows, other livestock, arms and ammunition, 15 lb of iron, pulleys and ropes, fishing gear, farming and mechanical equipment, cooking equipment and at least 1000 pounds of flour plus assorted other foodstuffs. Some pioneers overestimated the number of goods they could haul on the long journey. As the oxen weakened under the strain, wagons were lightened by discarding prized possessions, including book collections, family china, and furniture. In 1847, just east of the Rocky Mountains, the Kimball family dug a large hole, wrapped their piano in buffalo skins and carefully buried it. An ox team retrieved the instrument the following spring and transported it to the Salt Lake Valley.Slaughter, William and Landon, Michael. \\"Trail of Hope: The Story of the Mormon Trail\\". p. 23, 24. Deseret Book Company, Salt Lake City, 1997. Several later companies were largely made up of people with fewer resources, who pulled or pushed handcarts (similar to wheelbarrows) holding all of their provisions and personal belongings. Many of these pioneers walked much of the way as family members rode in the carts. Due to the weather in the American heartland, the best time to travel was April‚ÄìSeptember. Some companies, however, started late in the season which resulted in hardship and sometimes disaster. The most famous of these are the Willie and the Martin handcart companies. Leaving Iowa in July 1856, they did not reach Utah until November, suffering many deaths due to winter weather and the lack of adequate supplies. ==The ship Brooklyn== In November 1845, Samuel Brannan, newspaperman and small-scale publisher of the Mormon paper The Prophet (later the New York Messenger), was directed by church elders to charter a ship that would carry its passengers away from the eastern United States to California, which was then part of Mexico. Over the course of two months, Brannan managed to recruit 70 men, 68 women, and 100 children‚Äî238 persons total. Brannan negotiated a fare of $75 for adults and half-fare for children with the Captain Abel W. Richardson, master and a principal owner of the ship Brooklyn.Sonne, Conway B. Ships, Saints, and Mariners: A Maritime Encyclopedia of Mormon Migration, 1830-1890 pages 33. Salt Lake City, University of Utah Press, 1987 On February 4, 1846 (the same day the Mormon exodus from Nauvoo began), the ship Brooklyn cleared New York harbor and began its nearly 6-month voyage to the Pacific coast of the then- Mexican Territory of California.Roberts, B. H. (1930). A Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Century I 6 volumes. Vol.3, Ch.71, p.25. Brigham Young University Press; (1930; Hardcover 1965) (out of print) The ship weighed and measured 125 ft x x 4.3 m) and was built in 1834 by Joseph H. Russell at Newcastle, Maine.Sonne, Conway B. Ships, Saints, and Mariners: A Maritime Encyclopedia of Mormon Migration, 1830-1890 pages 32. Salt Lake City, University of Utah Press, 1987 This painting by Duncan McFarlane, shows the ship Brooklyn off Skerries Reef, which is off the north coast of Anglesey, North Wales. The voyage is the longest passage made by a Mormon emigrant company. The ship Brooklyn sailed from Brooklyn Harbor, New York, and traveled south across the Atlantic equator, around Cape Horn, stopping at the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands, then to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), finally docking in Yerba Buena (now San Francisco) on July 29, 1846, having made the sea voyage in five months and twenty-seven days. Augusta Joyce Crocheron, a passenger on the ship Brooklyn, described the voyage: The passengers of the ship Brooklyn left the United States with the hope of finding religious freedom. However, they arrived in Mexican Alta California just weeks after its occupation by the United States Navy at the outset of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Despite the tensions that drove them from their homes in the Eastern States, the crew and passengers \\"felt more cheerful and secure.\\" Mormon historian B. H. Roberts noted in his work A Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: This dangerous trek of nearly would claim 10 lives of the ship's 238 passengers,Ship Brooklyn Passenger List nine of whom were buried at sea. Brooklyn Place, in Chinatown, San Francisco, is named for the ship,The Chronicle 12 April 1987 p.7 as was the erstwhile Brooklyn, California. ==Later migration== After the initial departure of the Latter-day Saints living in Illinois and Missouri, converts to the church from other areas in the United States and from Europe followed the initial trail to join the main body of the church in Salt Lake City. Every year from 1847 until 1869, church members making this journey were formed into organized companies.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Migration continued until about 1890, but those who came by railroad are not generally considered to be \\"Mormon pioneers.\\" ===Danish Mormon pioneers=== Mormon pioneers emigrated from many countries. Denmark was one of those countries, with a large number of Mormon emigrants coming to Utah between 1850 and 1910. The migration of Danes was initiated when missionaries from the LDS Church, including Erastus Snow, Peter O. Hansen and two others, were sent to Denmark in 1850. Hansen made the first translation of the Book of Mormon from English, by translating it into Danish. Religious freedom was written into the constitution of the Kingdom of Denmark in 1849. Along with the Danish translation of the Book of Mormon, this opened the area to great success in attaining converts. At that time the LDS Church was urging new members to gather to Utah, which led these early converts to make emigration plans. Box Elder, Cache, Salt Lake, Utah, and Sevier counties had large numbers of Danes listed in 19th Century Utah census totals but Sanpete County was the area where the largest number settled. ==Growth and development== The Mormons settled in the Salt Lake Valley, which at that time was used as a buffer zone between the Shoshones and the Utes, who were at war.The Rest of the Story: Latter-day-Saint Relations with Utah-Native-Americans Upon arriving in the Salt Lake Valley, the Mormons developed and cultivated the arid terrain to make it more suitable. They created irrigation systems, laid out farms, built houses, churches and schools. Access to water was crucial. Almost immediately, Young sent out scouting parties to identify and settle additional community sites. While it was difficult to find large areas in the Great Basin where water sources were dependable and growing seasons long enough to raise vitally important subsistence crops, satellite communities began to be formed in all directions. Church members eventually headed south into present-day Arizona and Mexico, west into California, north into Idaho and Canada, and east into Wyoming, settling many communities in those areas. Shortly after the first company arrived in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, the community of Bountiful was established to the north. In 1848, pioneer moved into lands purchased from trapper Miles Goodyear in present-day Ogden. In 1849, Tooele and Fort Utah in modern-day Provo were founded. The settlement of Provo was particularly troubling to the Utes, since it was at the heart of their territory. Ute chief Wakara suggested the pioneers instead move into the Sanpete Valley in central Utah, where they established the community of Manti. Tensions in Fort Utah mounted after Mormons murdered Old Bishop,Peace and Violence among 19th- Century Latter-day Saints and Young ordered an attack on Utes,An account of the dialogue of the January 31 meeting can be found in BYC, Microfilm reel 80, box 47, folder 6. Brigham Young is quoted as stating: \\"I say go [and] kill them... Tell Dimick Huntington to go and kill them‚Äîalso Barney Ward‚Äîlet the women and children live if they behave themselves... We have no peace until the men [are] killed off‚Äînever treat the Indian as your equal.\\" Wells's Special Order No. 2 can be found in the Utah State Archives, State Capitol, Salt Lake City, Utah Territorial Militia Correspondence, 1849-1863, ST-27, Microfilm reel 1, Document No. 5 called the Battle at Fort Utah. This was shortly followed by the Walker War.Utah Historical Quarterly Volume XLVI 0pen Hand and Mailed Fist: Mormon-Indian Relations in Utah, 1847-52 by Howard A. Christy Fillmore, Utah, intended to be the capital of the new territory, was established in 1851. In 1855, efforts to subdue and evangelize to local Native people led to outposts in Fort Lemhi on Idaho's Salmon River, Las Vegas, Nevada and Elk Mountain in east-central of present-day Utah. The experiences of returning members of the Mormon Battalion were also important in establishing new communities. On their journey west, the Mormon soldiers had identified dependable rivers and fertile river valleys in Colorado, Arizona and southern California. In addition, as the discharged men traveled to rejoin their families in the Salt Lake Valley, they moved through southern Nevada and southern Utah. Jefferson Hunt, senior Mormon officer of the Battalion, actively searched for settlement sites, minerals and other resources. His report encouraged 1851 settlement efforts in Iron Country, near present-day Cedar City. These southern explorations eventually led to Mormon settlements in St. George, Utah, Las Vegas and San Bernardino, California, as well as communities in southern Arizona. By 1885, Mormon communities were being established in northern Mexico. ==Legacy== The Mormon Pioneer Memorial Monument in Salt Lake City The Mormon pioneers are celebrated annually on July 24 in the State of Utah, known as Pioneer Day. Salt Lake City also has the \\"Mormon Pioneer Memorial Monument,\\" where Young, Eliza R. Snow, and other Mormon pioneers are buried and where a memorial exists dedicated to all who crossed the plains to the Salt Lake Valley. Additionally, the \\"Pioneer\\" (characterized as \\"Pioneer Pete\\") is Lehi High School's mascot. Lehi High School is located in Lehi, Utah County. In some places, Mormons hold an event called \\"Pioneer Trek\\" for people who are ages fourteen to eighteen. In participating in the trek, the youth dress as pioneers and pack a few things to carry in handcarts. They go on a hike for a couple of days so they can experience what the pioneers had. During this multi-day event, camp organizers sometimes require youth to avoid the use of technology or anything that the pioneers did not have on their journeys, to enhance the experience. ==Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel Database== The Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel gathers information from journals, church history records, and other materials to locate the company in which an ancestor traveled across the plains to get to Utah. This covers known and unknown wagon trains from 1847 to 1868. It contains lists of passengers in companies as well as genealogical information about ancestors. It is the most comprehensive list of Mormon immigrants and the wagon trains that brought them to Utah. ==See also== * American pioneer * Come, Come, Ye Saints (hymn about pioneer migration) * Daughters of the Utah Handcart Pioneers * Daughters of Utah Pioneers * Haun's Mill massacre * History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints * History of the Latter Day Saint movement * History of Utah * List of Mormon family organizations * Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area * Mountain Meadows massacre * Sons of Utah Pioneers * This Is the Place Heritage Park ==Notes== ===Footnotes=== ==References== * Barney, Ronald O., editor.

He is popularly regarded as the winner of the first official cycle race in the world in 1868 at St-Cloud, Paris, although this claim seems to be erroneous. In 1869 he won the world's first road race Paris‚ÄìRouen sponsored by Le V√©locip√®de Illustr√© and the Olivier brothers' Michaux Bicycle Company. Moore covered the in 10 hours and 25 minutes. He was one of the first stars of cycle racing, dominating competition for many years. ==Early life and education== Moore was born in Long Brackland, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England on 14 January 1849.Duncan, H.

He rode the vehicle with the greatest enthusiasm.Bicycling > News, 5 October 1939 Moore used the v√©locip√®de to run errands for his father, travelling from the city centre to the suburbs.Kobayashi, Keizo (1990) Histoire de la Draisienne et du V√©locip√®de Michaux 1817‚Äì70 (2-9508121-0-4) James Moore's son, also James, said: > Six months [after moving to Paris] while most of the younger members of the > family were still struggling with French, it was young Jimmy who acted as > their interpreter.

The > acrobats and trapeze artists, too, were his friends and he learned many of > their tricks. At 18 he could do a double somersault between two trapezes ‚Äì > quite a feat. This account clashes with the claim that only the two sons were born when the family moved to France. ==Cycling career== ===The first cycle race - St- Cloud=== Moore joined the V√©loce cycling club of Paris after 1868. He began racing at the meeting held in the park at St-Cloud, west of Paris, on 31 May 1868. Moore's race is widely cited as the first formal cycle race in history and a plaque was added to the park railings to mark the event. But the validity of the claim is contested in Keizo Kobayashi's history of the DraisienneDescription and Image of Draisenne at French Wiki and the Michaux v√©locipede, which claims Moore's race was the third that day and not even the most important. The races on 31 May 1868, when Moore was 19, took place in the Saint-Cloud park in Paris. The races were to the park's fountain and back ‚Äì 1,200 metres on a gravel path. The French historian Pierre Chany wrote: > In Paris, 'pedalling machines' proliferated, characterised by wheels of 1m > or 1m 10 in front and 80cm at the back. Their riders gave exhibitions in > which they rivalled each other in technique and vigour.

(tr. Horn, M.) (2005), The Sweat of the Gods, Mousehold Press, p. 1, (See below for more on the \\"first race\\" mystery). The favourite for the second event was Fran√ßois Drouet who was the early leader. At half way James Moore took the lead, breaking clear \\"at the speed of lightning\\", according to Cycling Record, and won in 3 minutes and 50 seconds to the \\"frenetic hurrahs\\" of the crowd. Moore and Polocini were presented with gold medals worth one hundred francs awarded by the Compagnie Parisienne. Moore's was engraved with his name and carried the effigy of Napoleon III. What is believed to have been the first cycle race in Britain took place at the Welsh Harp the day after Moore won in the Parc de St-Cloud. The race was won by Arthur Markham, who for many years had a bicycle shop nearby at 345 Edgware Road. The St. Cloud races caught the public imagination and inspired events elsewhere. The first race in Britain was held the following day (see below) and races were held on 18 July in Ghent, Belgium. Races held in September in Brno, the capital of Moravia, marked the start of racing in central Europe. Moore's winning bicycle is in Ely City Museum in Cambridgeshire. It has a diamond-shaped iron downtube and a top tube and tyres of flattened metal. The rest is wood, including the wheels. The back wheel has a diameter of 31 inches, the front 38 inches. The gearing is 1:1 (the pedals connected to the front hub), so the gear is low. The machine's saddle perished and disappeared before the bicycle returned to Britain.Clifford, Peter (1968) You chose your parents well, Cycling Record, UK ====Commemorative plaque==== The Touring Club of France erected a plaque in the Saint-Cloud park reading: 'On 31 May 1868, James Moore became the winner of the first race for v√©locip√®des in France'.Cycling 8 June 1938 Among those present were Godfrey Haggarel, British consul-general in Paris; G√©o Lef√®vre, vice-chairman of the Association of Sports Journalists and the man who thought up the Tour de France, officials from the town hall of St-Cloud and the Touring Club de France, and the racers Henry Debray, Lucien Louvet and Rodolf Moller, and Victor Breyer, the deputy organiser of the Tour de France. The plaque has since disappeared.Woodland, L. (2005), This Island Race, Mousehold Press, p. 5 ====The 'first race' mystery==== James Moore believed all his life that he had won the first cycle race in the world.Moore, John (13 June 1997), letter to The Boneshaker, UK Keizo Kobayashi's research and thesis, however, attempts to show that Moore's was not the first race. Nick Clayton, editor of The Boneshaker, magazine of veteran-cycle enthusiasts in Britain, wrote: :Kobayashi has discovered at least five v√©locip√®de races in France which predate St Cloud, so the blue plaque on the railings proclaiming Moore as winner of the first v√©locip√®de race organised in France is incorrect on more than one count. True these races did not get the publicity that the Michaux organisation was able to attract for St-Cloud but it is curious why it should be James Moore's name on the plaque rather than Edward-Charles Bon, winner of the earlier 2.30 race or even Poloni [sic], winner of the Grande Course that day.Clayton, Nick (1991), The Cycling Career of James Moore, The Boneshaker (UK) vol 13 no 25 Citing Kobayashi, Clayton says the programme for St Cloud was: :1. At 2.30pm, 1km race for velocipedes of less than 1m [wheel] diameter, for a silver medal. Seven amateurs were involved, the winner was Edward- Charles Bon in 2min 40sec at a speed of 22.5 km/h. :2. 1 km race for velocipedes of 1 metre for a silver gilt medal. Winner James Moore in 2min 35sec, speed 23.2 km/h. Five contestants. This medal is in Ely museum. :3: Slow race of 50 metres. Six contestants, won by Durruthy. :4: Grande Course for a gold medal. Three riders. Won by Polonini [sic] in 2min 33sec, 23.5 km/h.Few of these details tie up with Chany's account, drawn from Cycling Record of the time. Moore's grandson put it to Clayton: :If you accept that James Moore believed he won the first bicycle race, then, as he surely cannot have forgotten that his race was at least scheduled to be the second of the day at St Cloud, there must have been either something different about the first race ‚Äì e.g. it was not exclusively for pedal machines ‚Äì or the order of the events was changed so that his race took place first. My hypothesis assumes the former proposition, and is only partly reliant on whether the rules stated that the front wheels of the velocipedes in the second race were to be precisely 1 metre diameter as stated in your article. My main argument, however, is that the word velocipede was used generically to include all types of machine including even hobby-horses for which it was originally coined. They would surely have had wheels of less than one metre diameter.Letter 13 June 1997 Clayton replied: :I think your attempt to redefine the second race at St Cloud as the first velocipede race does not hold water. Velocipedes meant boneshakers, only occasionally was there the odd tricycle or quadricycle. Boneshakers began effectively in 1867 and St Cloud was just one of several minor meetings which DuncanH. O. Duncan's history, The World on Wheels. James Moore contributed to the book and had a numbered first edition. \\"It is inconceivable,\\" said John Moore, \\"that James Moore did not go along with that account, including the claim that he won the first bicycle race with cranks and pedals.\\" just happened to immortalise.Letter 31 May 1997 James Moore believed to his death that he had won the world's first cycle race. Of suggestions that Moore had invented the story after rising to fame by winning the Paris‚ÄìRouen race (see below), his grandson John said: :In that case, being only one year or so after the St Cloud race, it is incredible that, if the claim were false, no one ‚Äì even from among the winners, spectators and other followers of the previous races as cited ‚Äì seems to have challenged that claim.Letter 29 May 1997 For a long time no contemporary sources could be found to support any of the claims. Until the Biblioth√®que nationale de France (French National Library) digitalised numerous French newspapers and periodicals. Le Petit-Journal published a report of these races in its issue of Tuesday 2 June 1868: > The races have taken place in the following order: > V√âLOCIP√àDES SMALLER THAN ONE METRE (silver medal): Mr. Ch. Bon, in 2 > minutes 40. > V√âLOCIP√àDES OF 1 METRE (gilded medal); five riders. Mr. James Moor, 1st, in > 2 minutes 35. > SLOW RACE (50 metres of the track); six competitors.

Mr. Polinini, 1st in 2 minutes 33 > seconds. ===Paris‚ÄìRouen ‚Äì 1869, the first road race=== The Olivier brothers were delighted with the race and the next year, 1869, 7 November, promoted the Paris‚ÄìRouen race ‚Äì about . The first prize was 1,000 francs, second prize a bicycle with suspension, then medals for the next three. The rules said the riders were not 'to be trailed by a dog or use sails'. 325 riders started the race. The course took them through St-Germain (16 km), Mantes (39 km), Vernon (63 km) and Louviers (97 km). The race started at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and finished in the centre of Rouen. He is presumed to have been riding a Suriray bicycle built by Tribout and equipped with ball bearings, which were patented by Jules Suriray, a Parisian bicycle mechanic, in 1869.Bicycle History, Chronology of the Growth of Bicycling and the Development of Bicycle Technology by David Mozer Moore's son, James, recalled: > To win Paris‚ÄìRouen, my father had to show muscular power, courage and > determination and intelligence. The Place de l'√âtoile [site of the Arc de > Triomphe] was again the scene, at seven o'clock in the morning... The pedal- > driven bicycle was now established and 325 riders had entered for the > 83-mile race to Rouen.

My father > was now considered so much a friend of France that he was being called 'The > Flying Parisian'. > Cast√©ra and Johnson both drew even numbers, which meant they went off in the > first group, 30 minutes before the odd numbers. My father drew number 187. > When the signal was given for the second group to move off, my father went > right to the front and was soon on his own. It was raining, and it remained > wet all day. Right down the Av√©nue de la Grande Arm√©e and the Av√©nue de > Neuilly, over the bridges of the Seine, and on towards the first control at > St Germain-en-Laye. As he pedalled hard up the steep hill near the town, he > passed a group of stragglers from the first group who were pushing their > machines. My father had gained 30 minutes on them in 12 miles! Moore caught Cast√©ra and then Johnson. He won in 10 hours and 25 minutes, finishing in front of an enthusiastic crowd at 6.10 pm. The average of only can be attributed to poor roads, lack of tyres, weight of the machine and the low gears. It was nevertheless fast enough that the mayor of Rouen, who was to present the trophies, was only stepping out of his carriage as Moore arrived. The runners-up were Jean-Eug√®ne-Andr√© Cast√©ra, sometimes described as a count (comte) even though the title had vanished with the Revolution, and Jean Bobillier from Voiron, on a farm bicycle weighing 35 kg. They finished 15 minutes after Moore and asked to be judged equal second. The only woman to finish in the time limit was a British woman who called herself Miss America. She came in 22nd at dawn next day. There was a banquet in Rouen that night and Moore's bicycle was draped with the Union Jack. When he went back to collect it from where it had been left outside a caf√© in the rue Notre Dame des Victoires, it had disappeared. The historian Derek Roberts wrote: > What bicycle did Moore ride in the Paris‚ÄìRouen race in 1869? There are two > candidates and three or four accounts.

But according to Nick Clayton, Moore preferred races in which he faced lesser competition and stood to win medals rather than money. Clayton wrote: > Moore appears to have rested on his laurels for a time and did not defend > his reputation in France in 1870. However, when war came in the summer he > returned to England and according to Bonneville, who can be unreliable, he > won at Wolverhampton on a Meyer.

Moore later (in 1873) set an hour record of 14 miles, 880 yards (23.331 km) at the Molyneaux Grounds in Wolverhampton. The book Bike Cult by Gavid B. Perry lists it as the very first hour record and the only one that was ridden on a tall bike. The Ariel bicycle had a 49\\"-front wheel and 3.91 meters development.http://www.bikecult.com/bikecultbook/sports_recordsHour.html Moore became an early world champion when he won the MacGregor Cup in 1872, 1873, 1874,Le V√©locip√®de, France, 11 April 1874 1875 and finally in Toulouse in 1877. He retired from racing in 1877. Victor Breyer said: > He had attained a unique position as a crack velocipede rider.

He went to work at Maisons Lafitte, the French horse racing centre. In 1945 he was made a Chevalier de la L√©gion d'Honneur . He studied at Cambridge, England, to become a member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, later becoming a Fellow. He started a stud farm in Normandy. Moore's son said: > My father retained his athletic outlook into his later years. On his 50th > birthday, he gave up smoking, announcing 'I am disgusted with myself for > following such a habit!'

He also took up tennis, at which \\"he was rarely beaten\\". He never lost his French accent when speaking English, Lord Brain saying of him at a meeting of physicians: \\"Dr Moore makes a tremendous effort to conceal his French intonation we all love so much.\\" It is unclear when Moore returned to Britain. Some reports say after the Prussian war, others that it was before the first world war and still anotherBreyer, Victor, Ancestor Among Ancestors, Cycling, 27 August 1947 pp188, 189 that it was at the start of the second world war. He moved to 56 Wildwood Road in Hampstead, North London, where he died after a prostate operation at the age of 86. His grandson, John Moore, says the whereabouts of his grave is unknown but may be in the area of the Welsh Harp reservoir near Cricklewood in north London. His obituary in Cycling read: > It is with deep regret that we have to record the death, at the age of 87, > of Mr James Moore, who, on May 31, 1868, won the first cycle race ever held > ‚Äì a 25-kilometre event at Ville de St Cloud...

In 1966, the Saddle Club of London suggested the British Post Office produce a commemorative stamp for the 100th anniversary of the St-Cloud race. The club suggested a design but the idea was not adopted. ===Burial mystery=== The location of Moore's grave is not known. His grandson, John, said: \\"The odd thing is that my father was such a good story-teller but he couldn't or wouldn't tell me where my grandfather was buried. It was if there was some unfinished business, some sort of mix-up, something I never understood. It's a mystery.\\" Procycling UK p107 Moore believes the site may be near the Welsh Harp reservoir ‚Äì also known as Brent Reservoir ‚Äì in north London. ==Bibliography== * Maso, B. (tr. Horn, M.)

The aim of capital accumulation is to create new fixed and working capitals, broaden and modernize the existing ones, grow the material basis of social-cultural activities, as well as constituting the necessary resource for reserve and insurance. The process of capital accumulation forms the basis of capitalism, and is one of the defining characteristics of a capitalist economic system.Unbounded Organization and the Future of Socialism, by Howard Richards. 2013. Education as Change, Vol. 17, No. 2, pp. 229-242: \\"Capital accumulation is both a dynamic and a logic. It is a dynamic that motivates human action, namely the pursuit of profit. It is a logic that defines rational decision-making, namely optimizing profits by maximizing revenue from sales while minimizing costs...The case is better understood if one takes into account that accumulation is the mainspring (according to Marx, the invariable accompaniment and virtually the definition) of capitalism.\\"Capital, Encyclopedia on Marxists.org: http://marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/a.htm#capital ==Definition== The definition of capital accumulation is subject to controversy and ambiguities, because it could refer to: *a net addition to existing wealth *a redistribution of wealth. Most often, capital accumulation involves both a net addition and a redistribution of wealth, which may raise the question of who really benefits from it most. If more wealth is produced than there was before, a society becomes richer; the total stock of wealth increases. But if some accumulate capital only at the expense of others, wealth is merely shifted from A to B. It is also possible that some accumulate capital much faster than others. When one person is enriched at the expense of another in circumstances that the law sees as unjust it is called unjust enrichment.See generally: Mitchell et al, Goff & Jones Law of Unjust Enrichment (Sweet & Maxwell, 8th ed, 2011); Graham Virgo, The Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015); Andrew Burrows, The Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2011); Mason, Carter, and Tolhurst, Mason & Carter's Restitution Law in Australia (LexisNexis, 2nd ed, 2008). On unjust enrichment as a 'unifying legal concept', see the judgment of Deane J in Pavey & Mathews v Paul (1987) 162 CLR 221. In principle, it is possible that a few people or organisations accumulate capital and grow richer, although the total stock of wealth of society decreases. In economics and accounting, capital accumulation is often equated with investment of profit income or savings, especially in real capital goods. The concentration and centralisation of capital are two of the results of such accumulation (see below). Capital accumulation refers ordinarily to: *real investment in tangible means of production, such as acquisitions, research and development, etc. that can increase the capital flow. *investment in financial assets represented on paper, yielding profit, interest, rent, royalties, fees or capital gains. *investment in non- productive physical assets such as residential real estate or works of art that appreciate in value. and by extension to: *human capital, i.e., new education and training increasing the skills of the (potential) labour force which can increase earnings from work. *social capital, i.e. the wealth and productive capacity that the people in a society hold in common, rather than as individuals or corporations. * etc. Both non-financial and financial capital accumulation is usually needed for economic growth, since additional production usually requires additional funds to enlarge the scale of production. Smarter and more productive organization of production can also increase production without increased capital. Capital can be created without increased investment by inventions or improved organization that increase productivity, discoveries of new assets (oil, gold, minerals, etc.), the sale of property, etc. In modern macroeconomics and econometrics the term capital formation is often used in preference to \\"accumulation\\", though the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) refers nowadays to \\"accumulation\\". The term is occasionally used in national accounts. ===Measurement of accumulation=== Accumulation can be measured as the monetary value of investments, the amount of income that is reinvested, or as the change in the value of assets owned (the increase in the value of the capital stock). Using company balance sheets, tax data and direct surveys as a basis, government statisticians estimate total investments and assets for the purpose of national accounts, national balance of payments and flow of funds statistics. Usually, the reserve banks and the Treasury provide interpretations and analysis of this data. Standard indicators include Capital formation, Gross fixed capital formation, fixed capital, household asset wealth, and foreign direct investment. Organisations such as the International Monetary Fund, UNCTAD, the World Bank Group, the OECD, and the Bank for International Settlements used national investment data to estimate world trends. The Bureau of Economic Analysis, Eurostat and the Japan Statistical Office provide data on the US, Europe and Japan respectively. Other useful sources of investment information are business magazines such as Fortune, Forbes, The Economist, Business Week, etc., and various corporate \\"watchdog\\" organisations and non-governmental organization publications. A reputable scientific journal is the Review of Income and Wealth. In the case of the US, the \\"Analytical Perspectives\\" document (an annex to the yearly budget) provides useful wealth and capital estimates applying to the whole country. ==Demand-led growth models== In macroeconomics, following the Harrod‚ÄìDomar model, the savings ratio (s) and the capital coefficient (k) are regarded as critical factors for accumulation and growth, assuming that all saving is used to finance fixed investment. The rate of growth of the real stock of fixed capital (K) is: : {{\\\\Delta K} \\\\over K} = {{{\\\\Delta K} \\\\over Y} \\\\over {K \\\\over Y}} = {s \\\\over k } where Y is the real national income. If the capital-output ratio or capital coefficient (k={K \\\\over Y}) is constant, the rate of growth of Y is equal to the rate of growth of K. This is determined by s (the ratio of net fixed investment or saving to Y) and k. A country might, for example, save and invest 12% of its national income, and then if the capital coefficient is 4:1 (i.e. $4 billion must be invested to increase the national income by 1 billion) the rate of growth of the national income might be 3% annually. However, as Keynesian economics points out, savings do not automatically mean investment (as liquid funds may be hoarded for example). Investment may also not be investment in fixed capital (see above). Assuming that the turnover of total production capital invested remains constant, the proportion of total investment which just maintains the stock of total capital, rather than enlarging it, will typically increase as the total stock increases. The growth rate of incomes and net new investments must then also increase, in order to accelerate the growth of the capital stock. Simply put, the bigger capital grows, the more capital it takes to keep it growing and the more markets must expand. The Harrodian model has a problem of unstable static equilibrium, since if the growth rate is not equal to the Harrodian warranted rate, the production will tend to extreme points (infinite or zero production).Serrano, F., Freitas, F., & Bhering, G. The Trouble with Harrod: the fundamental instability of the warranted rate in the light of the Sraffian Supermultiplier. The Neo-Kaleckians models do not suffer from the Harrodian instability but fails to deliver a convergence dynamic of the effective capacity utilization to the planned capacity utilization.Fagundes, L., & Freitas, F. (2017). The Role of Autonomous Non-Capacity Creating Expenditures in Recent Kaleckian Growth Models: An Assessment from the Perspective of the Sraffian Supermultiplier Model. For its turn, the model of the Sraffian Supermultiplier grants a static stable equilibrium and a convergence to the planned capacity utilization. The Sraffian Supermultiplier model diverges from the Harrodian model since it takes the investment as induced and not as autonomous. The autonomous components in this model are the Autonomous Non- Capacity Creating Expenditures, such as exports, credit lead consumption and public spending. The growth rate of these expenditures determines the long run rate of capital accumulation and product growth. ==Marxist concept== In Karl Marx's economic theory, capital accumulation is the operation whereby profits are reinvested into the economy, increasing the total quantity of capital. Capital was understood by Marx to be expanding value, that is, in other terms, as a sum of capital, usually expressed in money, that is transformed through human labor into a larger value and extracted as profits. Here, capital is defined essentially as economic or commercial asset value that is used by capitalists to obtain additional value (surplus-value). This requires property relations which enable objects of value to be appropriated and owned, and trading rights to be established. ===Over-accumulation and crisis=== The Marxist analysis of capital accumulation and the development of capitalism identifies systemic issues with the process that arise with expansion of the productive forces. A crisis of overaccumulation of capital occurs when the rate of profit is greater than the rate of new profitable investment outlets in the economy, arising from increasing productivity from a rising organic composition of capital (higher capital input to labor input ratio). This depresses the wage bill, leading to stagnant wages and high rates of unemployment for the working class while excess profits search for new profitable investment opportunities. Marx believed that this cyclical process would be the fundamental cause for the dissolution of capitalism and its replacement by socialism, which would operate according to a different economic dynamic. In Marxist thought, socialism would succeed capitalism as the dominant mode of production when the accumulation of capital can no longer sustain itself due to falling rates of profit in real production relative to increasing productivity. A socialist economy would not base production on the accumulation of capital, instead basing production on the criteria of satisfying human needs and directly producing use-values. This concept is encapsulated in the principle of production for use. ===Concentration and centralization=== According to Marx, capital has the tendency for concentration and centralization in the hands of richest capitalists. Marx explains: \\"It is concentration of capitals already formed, destruction of their individual independence, expropriation of capitalist by capitalist, transformation of many small into few large capitals.... Capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand, because it has in another place been lost by many.... The battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities. The cheapness of commodities demands, caeteris paribus, on the productiveness of labour, and this again on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered that, with the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions. The smaller capitals, therefore, crowd into spheres of production which Modern Industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of. Here competition rages.... It always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors, partly vanish.\\"Das Kapital, vol. 1, ch. 25 ===Rate of accumulation=== In Marxian economics, the rate of accumulation is defined as (1) the value of the real net increase in the stock of capital in an accounting period, (2) the proportion of realized surplus-value or profit- income which is reinvested, rather than consumed. This rate can be expressed by means of various ratios between the original capital outlay, the realized turnover, surplus-value or profit and reinvestment's (see, e.g., the writings of the economist Micha≈Ç Kalecki). Other things being equal, the greater the amount of profit-income that is disbursed as personal earnings and used for consumption purposes, the lower the savings rate and the lower the rate of accumulation is likely to be. However, earnings spent on consumption can also stimulate market demand and higher investment. This is the cause of endless controversies in economic theory about \\"how much to spend, and how much to save\\". In a boom period of capitalism, the growth of investments is cumulative, i.e. one investment leads to another, leading to a constantly expanding market, an expanding labor force, and an increase in the standard of living for the majority of the people. In a stagnating, decadent capitalism, the accumulation process is increasingly oriented towards investment on military and security forces, real estate, financial speculation, and luxury consumption. In that case, income from value-adding production will decline in favour of interest, rent and tax income, with as a corollary an increase in the level of permanent unemployment. As a rule, the larger the total sum of capital invested, the higher the return on investment will be. The more capital one owns, the more capital one can also borrow and reinvest at a higher rate of profit or interest. The inverse is also true, and this is one factor in the widening gap between the rich and the poor. Ernest Mandel emphasized that the rhythm of capital accumulation and growth depended critically on (1) the division of a society's social product between necessary product and surplus product, and (2) the division of the surplus product between investment and consumption. In turn, this allocation pattern reflected the outcome of competition among capitalists, competition between capitalists and workers, and competition between workers. The pattern of capital accumulation can therefore never be simply explained by commercial factors, it also involved social factors and power relationships. ===Circuit of capital accumulation from production=== Strictly speaking, capital has accumulated only when realized profit income has been reinvested in capital assets. But the process of capital accumulation in production has, as suggested in the first volume of Marx's Das Kapital, at least 7 distinct but linked moments: *The initial investment of capital (which could be borrowed capital) in means of production and labor power. *The command over surplus-labour and its appropriation. *The valorisation (increase in value) of capital through production of new outputs. *The appropriation of the new output produced by employees, containing the added value. *The realisation of surplus-value through output sales. *The appropriation of realised surplus-value as (profit) income after deduction of costs. *The reinvestment of profit income in production. All of these moments do not refer simply to an economic or commercial process. Rather, they assume the existence of legal, social, cultural and economic power conditions, without which creation, distribution and circulation of the new wealth could not occur. This becomes especially clear when the attempt is made to create a market where none exists, or where people refuse to trade. In fact Marx argues that the original or primitive accumulation of capital often occurs through violence, plunder, slavery, robbery, extortion and theft. He argues that the capitalist mode of production requires that people be forced to work in value-adding production for someone else, and for this purpose, they must be cut off from sources of income other than selling their labor power. ===Simple and expanded reproduction=== In volume 2 of Das Kapital, Marx continues the story and shows that, with the aid of bank credit, capital in search of growth can more or less smoothly mutate from one form to another, alternately taking the form of money capital (liquid deposits, securities, etc.), commodity capital (tradeable products, real estate etc.), or production capital (means of production and labor power). His discussion of the simple and expanded reproduction of the conditions of production offers a more sophisticated model of the parameters of the accumulation process as a whole. At simple reproduction, a sufficient amount is produced to sustain society at the given living standard; the stock of capital stays constant. At expanded reproduction, more product-value is produced than is necessary to sustain society at a given living standard (a surplus product); the additional product-value is available for investments which enlarge the scale and variety of production. The bourgeois claim there is no economic law according to which capital is necessarily re-invested in the expansion of production, that such depends on anticipated profitability, market expectations and perceptions of investment risk. Such statements only explain the subjective experiences of investors and ignore the objective realities which would influence such opinions. As Marx states in Vol.2, simple reproduction only exists if the variable and surplus capital realized by Dept. 1‚Äîproducers of means of production‚Äîexactly equals that of the constant capital of Dept. 2, producers of articles of consumption (pg 524). Such equilibrium rests on various assumptions, such as a constant labor supply (no population growth). Accumulation does not imply a necessary change in total magnitude of value produced but can simply refer to a change in the composition of an industry (pg. 514). Ernest Mandel introduced the additional concept of contracted economic reproduction, i.e. reduced accumulation where business operating at a loss outnumbers growing business, or economic reproduction on a decreasing scale, for example due to wars, natural disasters or devalorisation. Balanced economic growth requires that different factors in the accumulation process expand in appropriate proportions. But markets themselves cannot spontaneously create that balance, in fact what drives business activity is precisely the imbalances between supply and demand: inequality is the motor of growth. This partly explains why the worldwide pattern of economic growth is very uneven and unequal, even although markets have existed almost everywhere for a very long time. Some people argue that it also explains government regulation of market trade and protectionism. ===Origins=== According to Marx, capital accumulation has a double origin, namely in trade and in expropriation, both of a legal or illegal kind. The reason is that a stock of capital can be increased through a process of exchange or \\"trading up\\" but also through directly taking an asset or resource from someone else, without compensation. David Harvey calls this accumulation by dispossession. Marx does not discuss gifts and grants as a source of capital accumulation, nor does he analyze taxation in detail (He couldn't, as he died even before completing his major book, Das Kapital). Nowadays the tax take is often so large (i.e., 25-40% of GDP) that some authors refer to state capitalism. This gives rise to a proliferation of tax havens to evade tax liability. The continuation and progress of capital accumulation depends on the removal of obstacles to the expansion of trade, and this has historically often been a violent process. As markets expand, more and more new opportunities develop for accumulating capital, because more and more types of goods and services can be traded in. But capital accumulation may also confront resistance, when people refuse to sell, or refuse to buy (for example a strike by investors or workers, or consumer resistance). ===Capital accumulation as social relation=== \\"Accumulation of capital\\" sometimes also refers in Marxist writings to the reproduction of capitalist social relations (institutions) on a larger scale over time, i.e., the expansion of the size of the proletariat and of the wealth owned by the bourgeoisie. This interpretation emphasizes that capital ownership, predicated on command over labor, is a social relation: the growth of capital implies the growth of the working class (a \\"law of accumulation\\"). In the first volume of Das Kapital Marx had illustrated this idea with reference to Edward Gibbon Wakefield's theory of colonisation: In the third volume of Das Kapital, Marx refers to the \\"fetishism of capital\\" reaching its highest point with interest-bearing capital, because now capital seems to grow of its own accord without anybody doing anything. In this case, ==Markets with social influence== Product recommendations and information about past purchases have been shown to influence consumers choices significantly whether it is for music, movie, book, technological, and other type of products. Social influence often induces a rich-get-richer phenomenon (Matthew effect) where popular products tend to become even more popular. ==See also== *Business cycle *Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory) *Charity (practice) *Commodity fetishism *Constant purchasing power accounting *Culture of capitalism *Dual-sector model *History of capitalist theory *Internal contradictions of capital accumulation *Investment-specific technological progress *Matthew effect *Preferential attachment *Prices of production *Primitive socialist accumulation *Productive and unproductive labour *Proletarianization *Property income *Relations of production *Return on capital *Simple commodity production *Surplus value *The rich get richer and the poor get poorer *Unearned income *Unequal exchange *Value investing ==Notes== ==References== *Michel Aglietta, A Theory of Capitalist Regulation. *Elmar Altvater, Gesellschaftliche Produktion und √∂konomische Rationalit√§t; Externe Effekte und zentrale Planung im Wirtschaftssystem des Sozialismus. *Samir Amin, Accumulation on a World Scale. *Philip Armstrong, Andrew Glyn and John Harrison, Capitalism since World War II.

The highway travels north as Montlake Boulevard from an interchange with SR 520 and over the Montlake Bridge to the University of Washington campus in the University District. SR 513 continues past University Village before it turns northeast onto Sand Point Way and ends at the entrance to Magnuson Park in the Sand Point neighborhood. SR 513 was created during the 1964 state highway renumbering as the successor to Secondary State Highway 1J (SSH 1J), itself created in 1937 and traveling from Downtown Seattle to Lake City. Sections of SSH 1J, including Madison Street from Downtown to Capitol Hill, date as far back as 1854. Most sections of the highway were built in the 1890s and 1900s in preparation for the Alaska‚ÄìYukon‚ÄìPacific Exposition, which took place on the University of Washington campus in 1909. SR 513 was shortened in 1971 to its present southern terminus, the interchange with SR 520 in Montlake, and to an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5) on the Seattle-Shoreline city border. In 1991, the highway was truncated to its current northern terminus at Magnuson Park, eliminating its route through Lake City and much of North Seattle. ==Route description== SR 513 northbound near University Village SR 513 begins at the intersection of Montlake Boulevard and Lake Washington Boulevard in the Montlake neighborhood of Seattle, part of a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 520. The highway travels north on Montlake Boulevard and crosses the Montlake Cut section of the Lake Washington Ship Canal on the Montlake Bridge. The bascule drawbridge is designated as a city landmark and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1982. SR 513 continues north through the University of Washington campus within the University District and passes Husky Stadium and the campus light rail station before being joined by the Burke-Gilman Trail near the Hec Edmundson Pavilion. The highway turns east onto 45th Street and Sand Point Way at the University Village shopping mall and enters the Sand Point neighborhood near Seattle Children's Hospital. SR 513 continues northeast along the Burke- Gilman Trail past the Seattle branch of the National Archives before the highway ends at an intersection with 65th Street west of Magnuson Park. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 513 was within the University of Washington campus, serving 41,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section was its northern terminus at Magnuson Park, serving 14,000 vehicles. The entire route of SR 513 is part of the National Highway System, identifying it as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. ==History== The south tower of the Montlake Bridge, carrying SR 513 and its predecessors over the Lake Washington Ship Canal. SSH 1J, the predecessor to SR 513, was added to the state highway system in 1937 and traveled within the city of Seattle on streets that have existed since the 19th century. Madison Street, which carries SSH 1J from its southern terminus at U.S. Route 99 in Downtown to Capitol Hill was built in 1864 by local judge John J. McGilvra to connect his homestead at Madison Park to downtown. Other streets carrying SSH 1J, including 23rd and 24th Avenues towards Montlake, Montlake Boulevard through the University District, and Sand Point Way towards Sand Point were built during the early 1890s as the city of Seattle expanded. The rest of SSH 1J, traveling northwest from Naval Station Puget Sound at Sand Point through Lake City to US 99 on the border between Seattle and Shoreline via Roosevelt Way and 145th Street was constructed by the late 1800s to serve the University of Washington campus, site of the Alaska‚ÄìYukon‚ÄìPacific Exposition in 1909. SSH 1J was replaced by SR 513 during the 1964 state highway renumbering and codified in 1970 on its original route, connecting Downtown Seattle to Montlake and Lake City. In 1971, SR 513 was shortened to by moving its southern terminus to an interchange with SR 520 in Montlake and its northern terminus to an interchange with I-5 at 145th Street. The highway was further shortened, to its present length of , in 1991 by moving its northern terminus from I-5 to Magnuson Park at the site of the former Naval Station Puget Sound. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== *Highways of Washington State 513 Category:Transportation in King County, Washington Category:Transportation in Seattle ","title":"Washington State Route 513"},{"id":"845955","text":"This is a partial list of places named for American statesman John C.

Successive human cultures tended to be spread across Europe or further afield, but focusing on this particular geographical area sheds light on the origin of the widespread remains and monuments in Scotland, and on the background to the history of Scotland. The extent of open countryside untouched by intensive farming, together with past availability of stone rather than timber, has given Scotland a wealth of accessible sites where the ancient past can be seen. ==The remote prehistory of Scotland== Scotland is geologically alien to Europe, comprising a sliver of the ancient continent of Laurentia (which later formed the bulk of North America). During the Cambrian period the crustal region which became Scotland formed part of the continental shelf of Laurentia, then still south of the equator. Laurentia was separated from the continent of Baltica (which later became Scandinavia and the Baltic region) by the diminishing Iapetus Ocean. The two ancient continents moved toward one another through the Cambrian and Ordovician periods, with tectonic folding during the Silurian pushing the first Scottish land above water. The final collision occurred during the Devonian period, with the Scottish segment of the Laurentian plate smashing into Avalonia (which contained what is now most of England and Wales), a motile subcontinent which had previously joined with Baltica. This impact threw up a massive chain of mountains (at least as tall as the present-day Alps) and saw the formation of the granitic West Highland and Grampian mountain chains and (through the Carboniferous) a period of volcanic activity in central and eastern Scotland. During the Permian and Triassic periods, with the Iapetus Ocean entirely closed, Scotland lay near the centre of the Pangaean supercontinent. At the start of the Tertiary, a constructive plate boundary (at which tectonic plates move apart) became active between Laurentia and Eurasia, pushing the two apart (and parting Scotland from Laurentia). This recession opened the Atlantic Ocean for the first time, and the consequent subduction zone at the western plate margin led to a renewed period of volcanism, this time on Scotland's west coast, producing fresh mountains on Skye, Jura, Mull, R√πm, and Arran. This tectonic activity produced the basis of Scotland's topography: ancient mountains in the North and South of the country, partially eroded by 400 million years of water and ice with a wide fertile valley between them, and a newer, wilder western terrain. With Scotland now in the northern temperate zone, it was subjected to numerous glaciations in the Neogene and Quaternary periods, the ice sheets and their attendant glaciers carving the landscape into a typical postglacial one, overdeepening river valleys into the characteristic U-shape and leaving the upland areas covered with glacial corries and dramatic pyramidal peaks. In lowland areas the ice deposited rich fields of fertile glacial till and eroded the softer material surrounding the extinct volcanoes (particularly the older Carboniferous ones), leaving many crags. ==Before modern humans== During the last interglacial, around 130,000‚Äì70,000 BC, there were times when the climate in Europe was warmer than it is today, and after the Neanderthals came to prominence there was another mild spell around 40,000 BC. Neanderthal sites have been found in the south of England from this era, though no traces of early modern humans have been found. Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and it was only after the ice retreated about 15,000 years ago that Scotland again became habitable. ==Hunter-gatherers== As the climate improved, mesolithic hunter- gatherers extended their range into Scotland. The earliest evidence to date is the flint artefacts found at Howburn Farm, near Elsrickle in 2005. This is the first and so far the only evidence of Upper Paleolithic human habitation in Scotland, around 12,000 BC, which appears to fall between the Younger Dryas and Lomond Stadial periods when cold conditions returned relatively briefly.Haworth, Jenny (10 April 2009) \\"Scotland's most ancient home found ‚Äì at 14,000 years old\\" The Scotsman. Edinburgh. Retrieved 24 June 2009.\\"Earliest site in Scotland discovered\\" . biggararchaeology.org.uk. Retrieved 13 March 2011.\\"South end of Loch Lomond (Geomorphology)\\" . Scottish Geology. Retrieved 13 March 2011. An early settlement at Cramond, near what is today Edinburgh, has been dated to around 8500 BC. Pits and stakeholes suggest a hunter- gatherer encampment, and microlith stone tools made at the site predate finds of similar style in England. Although no bones or shells had survived the acid soil, numerous carbonised hazelnut shells indicate cooking in a similar way to finds at other Mesolithic period sites, including the slightly earlier Star Carr and the Howick house in Northumberland, dated to 7600 BC (\\"Britain's oldest house\\"), where post holes indicate a very substantial construction, interpreted as a permanent residence for hunting people. This suggests that hunter-gatherers could also have settled down in Scotland. Other sites on the east coast and at lochs and rivers, and large numbers of rock shelters and shell middens around the west coast and islands, build up a picture of highly mobile people, often using sites seasonally and having boats for fishing and for transporting stone tools from sites where suitable materials were found. Finds of flint tools on Ben Lawers and at Glen Dee (a mountain pass through the Cairngorms) show that these people were capable of travelling well inland across the hills. At a rock shelter and shell midden at Sand, Applecross in Wester Ross facing Skye, excavations have shown that around 7500 BC people had tools of bone, stone and antlers, were living off shellfish, fish, and deer using \\"pot-boiler\\" stones as a cooking method, were making beads from seashells, and had ochre pigment and used shellfish which can produce purple dye. ==Farmers and monument builders== Neolithic dwellings at Skara Brae, Orkney Neolithic farming brought permanent settlements. At Balbridie in Aberdeenshire crop markings were investigated, and ditches and post holes found, revealing a massive timber-framed building dating to about 3600 BC. An almost identical building, with evidence of pottery, was excavated at Claish near Stirling. On the islet of Eilean Domhnuill, in Loch Olabhat on North Uist, Unstan ware pottery suggests a date of 3200‚Äì2800 BC for what may be the earliest crannog. The remainder of this section focuses mainly on the Orkney Islands, where there is a Neolithic landscape rich in sites amazingly preserved by prevalent use of the local stone which appears on the shore ready-split into convenient building slabs. There are many other examples across the country, many under the care of Historic Scotland. At the wonderfully well preserved stone house at Knap of Howar on the Orkney island of Papa Westray (occupied from 3500 BC to 3100 BC) the walls stand to a low eaves height, and the stone furniture is intact. Evidence from middens shows that the inhabitants kept cattle, sheep and pigs, farmed barley and wheat and gathered shellfish, as well as fishing for species which must be caught from boats using lines. Finely made and decorated Unstan ware pottery links the inhabitants to chambered cairn tombs nearby and to sites far afield, including Balbrindi and Eilean Domhnuill. The houses at Skara Brae on the Mainland of the Orkney Islands are very similar, but are grouped into a village linked by low passageways. This settlement was occupied from about 3000 BC to 2500 BC. Pottery found here is of the grooved ware style which is found across Britain as far away as Wessex. About 6 miles (10 km) from Skara Brae, grooved ware pottery was found at the Standing Stones of Stenness (originally a circle) which lie centrally in a close group of three major monuments. Maeshowe, the finest example of the passage grave type of chambered cairn (radiocarbon dated to before 2700 BC) lies just to the east. The Ring of Brodgar circle of standing stones is across a bridge immediately to the north. This circle was one of the first to be analysed by Professor Alexander Thom to establish the likely use of standing stones as astronomical observatories. Another Neolithic village has been found nearby at Barnhouse Settlement, and the inference is that these farming people were the builders and users of these mysterious structures. Like the standing stones at Callanish on Lewis and other standing stones across Scotland, these monuments form part of the Europe-wide Megalithic culture which also produced Stonehenge in Wiltshire and the stone rows at Carnac in Brittany. Further evidence can be found in Kilmartin Glen with its Stone Circles, Standing Stones and Rock Art The widespread connections of these people are shown by offerings imported from Cumbria and Wales and left on the sacred hilltop at Cairnpapple Hill, West Lothian, as early as 3500 BC. ==Bronze Age== Bronze-age burial cist, Cairnpapple West Lothian The cairns and megalithic monuments continued into the Bronze Age, though there was a decline in both the building of large new structures and the total area under cultivation.Moffat, Alistair (2005) Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History. London. Thames & Hudson. Page 154. The Clava cairns and standing stones near Inverness show complex geometries and astronomical alignments, with smaller, perhaps individual, tombs instead of the communal Neolithic tombs. Mummies dating from 1600‚Äì1300 BC have been discovered at Cladh Hallan on South Uist. Hill forts were introduced, such as Eildon Hill near Melrose in the Scottish Borders, which goes back to around 1000 BC and which accommodated several hundred houses on a fortified hilltop. Excavation at Edinburgh Castle found late Bronze Age material from about 850 BC. ==Iron Age== From around 700 BC and extending into Roman times, the Iron Age was an age of forts and defended farmsteads, which support the image of quarrelsome tribes and petty kingdoms recorded by the Romans. Evidence that at times occupants neglected the defences might suggest that symbolic power was as significant as warfare. Traprain Law, East Lothian Brythonic (or \\"Pritennic\\") Celtic culture and language spread into southern Scotland at some time after the 8th century BC, possibly through cultural contact rather than mass invasion, and systems of kingdoms developed. Larger fortified settlements expanded, such as the Votadini stronghold of Traprain Law, East Lothian, which was the size of a town. Huge numbers of small duns, hill forts and ring forts were built on any suitable crag or hillock. The spectacular brochs were built, most impressively the nearly complete Mousa Broch, Shetland. Many Souterrain underground passageways were constructed, though their purpose is obscure. Island settlements linked with land by a causeway, the crannogs, became common; it is thought that their function was defensive. ==Access - guide books== The government website, Historic Scotland, lists many accessible sites and monuments including most of those mentioned above, and others are also freely accessible, making exploration of the distant past open to anyone with a guide book and map.

After playing in senior hockey in the Alberta-based Big-4 League, the Eskimos joined the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) for the inaugural 1921‚Äì22 WCHL season, and played for the Stanley Cup against the Ottawa Senators in 1923, as the WCHL Champions. Team alumni include Hockey Hall of Fame members Eddie Shore, Duke Keats and Bullet Joe Simpson. While the Edmonton Eskimos disbanded after the 1926‚Äì27 season, the name was adopted by a new team in 1932‚Äì33, playing for four years before it disbanded. The name was adopted by another new team for a single 1938‚Äì39 season. ==History== The Eskimos club was formed for the 1909‚Äì10 season by sports promoter Deacon White, from the remains of the amateur Edmonton Hockey Club, and inherited its predecessor's membership in the Alberta Amateur Hockey Association (AAHA). In 1909‚Äì10 and 1911‚Äì12 the club was loosely known as the \\"Edmonton Deacons\\", after Edmonton sports promoter William Deacon White. Prior to the 1911‚Äì12 season the team officially adopted the name Edmonton Eskimos, influenced by Deacon White's Edmonton Esquimaux rugby football club. The early Eskimos played in the Thistle Rink, until it burned down in 1912.Photos: Thistle Rink & Theatre (102 Street) In 1919‚Äì20, the AAHA formed the \\"Big Four\\" senior league, composed of two teams in Edmonton, and two in Calgary. This league folded in 1921, and the Eskimos helped to found the Western Canada Hockey League, with Ken McKenzie as their head coach. The Eskimos were the WCHL regular season champion for the inaugural 1921‚Äì22 WCHL season, finishing second in the 1921‚Äì22 playoffs. The Eskimos repeated as regular season champion in the 1922‚Äì23 WCHL season, then defeated the Regina Capitals to win the 1922‚Äì23 WCHL playoff championship. The team then played in the 1923 Stanley Cup Finals against the Ottawa Senators. The Regina Capitals moved to Portland, Oregon in the summer of 1925, leading to the WCHL renaming itself the Western Hockey League (WHL). The Eskimos won their third regular season championship in the single 1925‚Äì26 WHL season, finishing second in that season's playoffs. The WHL disbanded after the 1925‚Äì26 season, and the Eskimos joined other WHL teams, plus some new franchises, to form the Prairie Hockey League, with the Eskimos finished last of the five teams in the inaugural 1926‚Äì27 PHL season. The Eskimos disbanded at that end of that season. == Later incarnations == The name Edmonton Eskimos was adopted by an amateur senior team that played in the Western Canada Hockey League in 1932‚Äì33, which was reformed as the North West Hockey League (NWHL) for the 1933‚Äì34 season. This Eskimos team disbanded after the 1935‚Äì36 NWHL season. The name was adopted by a team that played in the Alberta Senior Hockey League (ASHL) in 1938‚Äì39. == Hockey Hall of Fame == A number of Edmonton Eskimos players have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, recognizing their bodies of work, including their time with the Big-4/WCHL/WHL/PHL Eskimos teams: * Tommy Dunderdale * Duke Keats * Eddie Shore * Bullet Joe Simpson * Barney Stanley == Gallery == Photos from the Edmonton Eskimos' 1921‚Äì22 WCHL regular season championship team: File:Howard Dea.jpgEskimo centerman Howard Dea File:Art Gagn√©, Edmonton Eskimos.pngEskimo right winger Art Gagn√© File:Bill Tobin, Edmonton Eskimos.jpgEskimo goaltender Bill Tobin ==See also== * List of ice hockey teams in Alberta ==References== ==External links== * Team Statistics * Jersey photos * ASHL Standings from 1938-39, the only season in HockeyDB's records for that era Category:Alberta Senior Hockey League Category:Defunct ice hockey teams in Canada Category:Ice hockey teams in Alberta Esk Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 1910 Category:1910 establishments in Alberta Category:1927 disestablishments in Canada 2 Category:Sports clubs disestablished in 1927 ","title":"Edmonton Eskimos (ice hockey)"},{"id":"845976","text":"The Progress of the State quadriga at the base of the Minnesota State Capitol dome. Progress of the State is the title of a group of sculptural figures that sits above the south portico, at the main entrance to the Minnesota State Capitol in Saint Paul, the state capital of the U.S. state of Minnesota. The statuary group is in an arrangement known as a quadriga, consisting of a chariot pulled by four horses. Three human figures, two women and a man, are included. The sculpture, made by Daniel Chester French and Edward Clark Potter, was completed and raised to the roof of the capitol in 1906. The underlying armature is steel covered in copper. The exterior copper surface is gilded in gold leaf. This quadriga is unusual in that it sits atop a building's portico, rather than upon a triumphal arch like most others. The quadriga arrangement is an ancient style of statue originating more than 2000 years ago in the Roman Republic. The four horses represent the classical elements of earth, air, fire, and water. Independently, the women represent industry and agriculture. Collectively, they represent civilization. The male charioteer represents prosperity. He holds aloft a variation of a Roman Legion standard inscribed with the state name MINNESOTA. In 1994 the group was taken down from the capitol roof for a year-long restoration procedure. The quadriga was reinstalled in 1995 and the figures have had several minor in situ reapplications of gold leaf since. A comprehensive restoration of the State Capitol building was completed in August 2017. A closeup of the horses ==References== ==External links== *Minnesota State Capitol: Quadriga.

Environmental degradation is the deterioration of the environment through depletion of resources such as air, water and soil; the destruction of ecosystems; habitat destruction; the extinction of wildlife; and pollution. It is defined as any change or disturbance to the environment perceived to be deleterious or undesirable.Johnson, D.L., S.H. Ambrose, T.J. Bassett, M.L. Bowen, D.E. Crummey, J.S. Isaacson, D.N. Johnson, P. Lamb, M. Saul, and A.E. Winter-Nelson. 1997. Meanings of environmental terms. Journal of Environmental Quality 26: 581‚Äì589. As indicated by the I=PAT equation, environmental impact (I) or degradation is caused by the combination of an already very large and increasing human population (P), continually increasing economic growth or per capita affluence (A), and the application of resource-depleting and polluting technology (T).Chertow, M.R., \\"The IPAT equation and its variants\\", Journal of Industrial Ecology, 4 (4):13‚Äì29, 2001.Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). Technofix: Why Technology Won‚Äôt Save Us or the Environment, Chapter 6, \\"Sustainability or Collapse?\\", New Society Publishers, . Environmental degradation is one of the ten threats officially cautioned by the High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change of the United Nations. The United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction defines environmental degradation as \\"the reduction of the capacity of the environment to meet social and ecological objectives, and needs\\". Environmental degradation comes in many types. When natural habitats are destroyed or natural resources are depleted, the environment is degraded. Efforts to counteract this problem include environmental protection and environmental resources management. There are many examples of environmental degradation throughout the world. A recent example is the 2019 Amazon rainforest wildfires. The Amazon makes up 60% of all rainforests. It is the earth's lungs and with it getting destroyed is posing a huge threat to the environment and the whole world. The effects of the deforestation will pose major impacts on the world around us. The constant cutting down of trees is getting rid of our oxygen supply as well as the absorption of co2. With the continuation of deforestation we will have less available oxygen in the world which could have detrimental effects on human health. An alternate issue that results from this is the overconsumption and waste of the paper products that come from those trees. The waste it typically produces does not get recycled, therefore, immense amount of waste is created. An additional harmful result from this is the degradation of the soil. The constant deforestation causes the soil to become less nutrient which will make it harder to be used again. == Biodiversity loss == Deforestation in the Maranh√£o state, Brazil, 2016 Scientists assert that human activity has pushed the earth into a sixth mass extinction event. The loss of biodiversity has been attributed in particular to human overpopulation, continued human population growth and overconsumption of natural resources by the world's wealthy. A 2020 report by the World Wildlife Fund found that human activity, specifically overconsumption, population growth and intensive farming, has destroyed 68% of vertebrate wildlife since 1970. The Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, published by the United Nation's IPBES in 2019, posits that roughly one million species of plants and animals face extinction from anthropogenic causes, such as expanding human land use for industrial agriculture and livestock rearing, along with overfishing. The implications of these losses for human livelihoods and wellbeing have raised serious concerns. With regard to the agriculture sector for example, The State of the World‚Äôs Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture, published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2019, states that ‚Äúcountries report that many species that contribute to vital ecosystem services, including pollinators, the natural enemies of pests, soil organisms and wild food species, are in decline as a consequence of the destruction and degradation of habitats, overexploitation, pollution and other threats‚Äù and that ‚Äúkey ecosystems that deliver numerous services essential to food and agriculture, including supply of freshwater, protection against hazards and provision of habitat for species such as fish and pollinators, are declining.‚Äù Alt URL == Water degradation == Ethiopia's move to fill the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam's reservoir could reduce Nile flows by as much as 25% and devastate Egyptian farmlands. One major component of environmental degradation is the depletion of the resource of fresh water on Earth. Approximately only 2.5% of all of the water on Earth is fresh water, with the rest being salt water. 69% of fresh water is frozen in ice caps located on Antarctica and Greenland, so only 30% of the 2.5% of fresh water is available for consumption.‚ÄùWater.‚Äù Climate Institute. Web. Retrieved 2011-11-03. Fresh water is an exceptionally important resource, since life on Earth is ultimately dependent on it. Water transports nutrients, minerals and chemicals within the biosphere to all forms of life, sustains both plants and animals, and moulds the surface of the Earth with transportation and deposition of materials.Young, Gordon J., James Dooge, and John C. Rodda. Global Water Resource Issues. Cambridge UP, 2004. The current top three uses of fresh water account for 95% of its consumption; approximately 85% is used for irrigation of farmland, golf courses, and parks, 6% is used for domestic purposes such as indoor bathing uses and outdoor garden and lawn use, and 4% is used for industrial purposes such as processing, washing, and cooling in manufacturing centres.Frederick, Kenneth D., and David C. Major. ‚ÄúClimate Change and Water Resources.‚Äù Climatic Change 37.1 (1997): p 7-23. It is estimated that one in three people over the entire globe are already facing water shortages, almost one-fifth of the world population live in areas of physical water scarcity, and almost one quarter of the world's population live in a developing country that lacks the necessary infrastructure to use water from available rivers and aquifers. Water scarcity is an increasing problem due to many foreseen issues in the future including population growth, increased urbanization, higher standards of living, and climate change. === Climate change and temperature === Climate change affects the Earth's water supply in a large number of ways. It is predicted that the mean global temperature will rise in the coming years due to a number of forces affecting the climate. The amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) will rise, and both of these will influence water resources; evaporation depends strongly on temperature and moisture availability which can ultimately affect the amount of water available to replenish groundwater supplies. Transpiration from plants can be affected by a rise in atmospheric CO2, which can decrease their use of water, but can also raise their use of water from possible increases of leaf area. Temperature rise can reduce the snow season in the winter and increase the intensity of the melting snow leading to peak runoff of this, affecting soil moisture, flood and drought risks, and storage capacities depending on the area.Ragab, Ragab, and Christel Prudhomme. \\"Soil and Water: Climate Change and Water Resources Management in Arid and Semi-Arid Regions: Prospective Challenges for the 21st Century\\". Biosystems Engineering 81.1 (2002): p 3-34. Warmer winter temperatures cause a decrease in snowpack, which can result in diminished water resources during summer. This is especially important at mid-latitudes and in mountain regions that depend on glacial runoff to replenish their river systems and groundwater supplies, making these areas increasingly vulnerable to water shortages over time; an increase in temperature will initially result in a rapid rise in water melting from glaciers in the summer, followed by a retreat in glaciers and a decrease in the melt and consequently the water supply every year as the size of these glaciers get smaller and smaller. Thermal expansion of water and increased melting of oceanic glaciers from an increase in temperature gives way to a rise in sea level. This can affect the fresh water supply to coastal areas as well. As river mouths and deltas with higher salinity get pushed further inland, an intrusion of saltwater results in an increase of salinity in reservoirs and aquifers. Sea-level rise may also consequently be caused by a depletion of groundwater,Konikow, Leonard F. \\"Contribution of Global Groundwater Depletion since 1990 to Sea-level Rise\\". Geophysical Research Letters 38.17 (2011). as climate change can affect the hydrologic cycle in a number of ways. Uneven distributions of increased temperatures and increased precipitation around the globe results in water surpluses and deficits, but a global decrease in groundwater suggests a rise in sea level, even after meltwater and thermal expansion were accounted for, which can provide a positive feedback to the problems sea-level rise causes to fresh-water supply. A rise in air temperature results in a rise in water temperature, which is also very significant in water degradation as the water would become more susceptible to bacterial growth. An increase in water temperature can also affect ecosystems greatly because of a species' sensitivity to temperature, and also by inducing changes in a body of water's self-purification system from decreased amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water due to rises in temperature. === Climate change and precipitation === A rise in global temperatures is also predicted to correlate with an increase in global precipitation but because of increased runoff, floods, increased rates of soil erosion, and mass movement of land, a decline in water quality is probable, because while water will carry more nutrients it will also carry more contaminants. While most of the attention about climate change is directed towards global warming and greenhouse effect, some of the most severe effects of climate change are likely to be from changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture. It is generally expected that, on average, global precipitation will increase, with some areas receiving increases and some decreases. Climate models show that while some regions should expect an increase in precipitation, such as in the tropics and higher latitudes, other areas are expected to see a decrease, such as in the subtropics. This will ultimately cause a latitudinal variation in water distribution. The areas receiving more precipitation are also expected to receive this increase during their winter and actually become drier during their summer, creating even more of a variation of precipitation distribution. Naturally, the distribution of precipitation across the planet is very uneven, causing constant variations in water availability in respective locations. Changes in precipitation affect the timing and magnitude of floods and droughts, shift runoff processes, and alter groundwater recharge rates. Vegetation patterns and growth rates will be directly affected by shifts in precipitation amount and distribution, which will in turn affect agriculture as well as natural ecosystems. Decreased precipitation will deprive areas of water causing water tables to fall and reservoirs of wetlands, rivers, and lakes to empty. In addition, a possible increase in evaporation and evapotranspiration will result, depending on the accompanied rise in temperature. Groundwater reserves will be depleted, and the remaining water has a greater chance of being of poor quality from saline or contaminants on the land surface. === Population growth === CE. It shows exponential rise in world population that has taken place since the end of the seventeenth century. The human population on Earth is expanding exponentially which goes hand in hand with the degradation of the environment at large measures. Humanity's appetite for needs is disarranging the environment's natural equilibrium. Production industries are venting smoke and discharging chemicals that are polluting water resources. The smoke that is emitted into the atmosphere holds detrimental gases such as carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide. The high levels of pollution in the atmosphere form layers that are eventually absorbed into the atmosphere. Organic compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFC‚Äôs) have generated an unwanted opening in the ozone layer, which emits higher levels of ultraviolet radiation putting the globe at large threat. The available fresh water being affected by the climate is also being stretched across an ever-increasing global population. It is estimated that almost a quarter of the global population is living in an area that is using more than 20% of their renewable water supply; water use will rise with population while the water supply is also being aggravated by decreases in streamflow and groundwater caused by climate change. Even though some areas may see an increase in freshwater supply from an uneven distribution of precipitation increase, an increased use of water supply is expected.Raleigh, Clionadh, and Henrik Urdal. ‚ÄúClimate Change, Environmental Degradation, and Armed Conflict.‚Äù Political Geography 26.6 (2007): 674‚Äì94. An increased population means increased withdrawals from the water supply for domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses, the largest of these being agriculture,MacDonald, Glen M. \\"Water, Climate Change, and Sustainability in the Southwest\\". PNAS 107.50 (2010): p 56-62. believed to be the major non- climate driver of environmental change and water deterioration. The next 50 years will likely be the last period of rapid agricultural expansion, but the larger and wealthier population over this time will demand more agriculture.Tilman, David, Joseph Fargione, Brian Wolff, Carla D'Antonio, Andrew Dobson, Robert Howarth, David Scindler, William Schlesinger, Danielle Simberloff, and Deborah Swackhamer. \\"Forecasting Agriculturally Driven Global Environmental Change\\". Science 292.5515 (2011): p 281-84. Population increase over the last two decades, at least in the United States, has also been accompanied by a shift to an increase in urban areas from rural areas,Wallach, Bret. Understanding the Cultural Landscape. New York; Guilford, 2005. which concentrates the demand for water into certain areas, and puts stress on the fresh water supply from industrial and human contaminants. Urbanization causes overcrowding and increasingly unsanitary living conditions, especially in developing countries, which in turn exposes an increasingly number of people to disease. About 79% of the world's population is in developing countries, which lack access to sanitary water and sewer systems, giving rises to disease and deaths from contaminated water and increased numbers of disease-carrying insects. .

Changes in climate, especially the changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration predicted by climate models, will directly affect soil moisture, surface runoff, and groundwater recharge. In areas with decreasing precipitation as predicted by the climate models, soil moisture may be substantially reduced. With this in mind, agriculture in most areas already needs irrigation, which depletes fresh water supplies both by the physical use of the water and the degradation agriculture causes to the water. Irrigation increases salt and nutrient content in areas that would not normally be affected, and damages streams and rivers from damming and removal of water. Fertilizer enters both human and livestock waste streams that eventually enter groundwater, while nitrogen, phosphorus, and other chemicals from fertilizer can acidify both soils and water. Certain agricultural demands may increase more than others with an increasingly wealthier global population, and meat is one commodity expected to double global food demand by 2050, which directly affects the global supply of fresh water. Cows need water to drink, more if the temperature is high and humidity is low, and more if the production system the cow is in is extensive, since finding food takes more effort. Water is needed in processing of the meat, and also in the production of feed for the livestock. Manure can contaminate bodies of freshwater, and slaughterhouses, depending on how well they are managed, contribute waste such as blood, fat, hair, and other bodily contents to supplies of fresh water.\\"Environmental Implications of the Global Demand for Red Meat\\". Web. Retrieved 2011-11-14. The transfer of water from agricultural to urban and suburban use raises concerns about agricultural sustainability, rural socioeconomic decline, food security, an increased carbon footprint from imported food, and decreased foreign trade balance. The depletion of fresh water, as applied to more specific and populated areas, increases fresh water scarcity among the population and also makes populations susceptible to economic, social, and political conflict in a number of ways; rising sea levels forces migration from coastal areas to other areas farther inland, pushing populations closer together breaching borders and other geographical patterns, and agricultural surpluses and deficits from the availability of water induce trade problems and economies of certain areas. Climate change is an important cause of involuntary migration and forced displacementBogumil Terminski, Environmentally-Induced Displacement. Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges cedem.ulg.ac.be According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, global greenhouse gas emissions from animal agriculture exceeds that of transportation. === Water management === A stream in the town of Amlwch, Anglesey which is contaminated by acid mine drainage from the former copper mine at nearby Parys Mountain The issue of the depletion of fresh water can be met by increased efforts in water management. While water management systems are often flexible, adaptation to new hydrologic conditions may be very costly. Preventative approaches are necessary to avoid high costs of inefficiency and the need for rehabilitation of water supplies, and innovations to decrease overall demand may be important in planning water sustainability. Water supply systems, as they exist now, were based on the assumptions of the current climate, and built to accommodate existing river flows and flood frequencies. Reservoirs are operated based on past hydrologic records, and irrigation systems on historical temperature, water availability, and crop water requirements; these may not be a reliable guide to the future. Re-examining engineering designs, operations, optimizations, and planning, as well as re-evaluating legal, technical, and economic approaches to manage water resources are very important for the future of water management in response to water degradation. Another approach is water privatization; despite its economic and cultural effects, service quality and overall quality of the water can be more easily controlled and distributed. Rationality and sustainability is appropriate, and requires limits to overexploitation and pollution and efforts in conservation. == See also == * Anthropocene * Environmental issues * Ecological collapse * Ecologically sustainable development * Eco-socialism * Exploitation of natural resources * Restoration ecology * United Nations Decade on Biodiversity * United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) * United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) * World Resources Institute (WRI) == Sources == == References == == External links == * Ecology of Increasing Disease Population growth and environmental degradation * Environmental Change in the Kalahari: Integrated Land Degradation Studies for Nonequilibrium Dryland Environments in the Annals of the Association of American Geographers * Public Daily Brief Threat: Environmental Degradation * Focus: Environmental degradation is contributing to health threats worldwide * Environmental Degradation of Materials in Nuclear Systems-Water Reactors *Herndon and Gibbon Lieutenants United States Navy The First North American Explorers of the Amazon Valley, by Historian Normand E.

She is the London and Windsor Community Chair in Islamic Studies at Huron University College at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, Canada. Mattson is a former president of the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) and was described as \\"Perhaps the most noticed figure among American Muslim women\\" in a 2010 New York Times article. ==Early life and background== Ingrid Mattson, the sixth of seven children, was born in 1963 in Kingston, Ontario, where she spent her childhood and attended Catholic schools.\\"Mattson, Ingrid\\", in Encyclopedia of Muslim-American History, Edward E. Curtis (Infobase Publishing, 2010) p362 She credits the Catholic women who educated her with providing \\"a fantastic education\\" and \\"a place to explore and develop this early, youthful spirituality\\". She studied Philosophy and Fine Arts at the University of Waterloo in Canada from 1982-87\\\\. As part of her course of study, she spent summer of 1986 as a visiting student in Paris, France. During this time, she befriended West African students from a Sufi Muslim community. On reading the Qur'an, she found, \\"an awareness of God, for the first time since I was very young.\\" After returning to Waterloo, she converted to Islam in 1987. She completed her studies in Waterloo and earned combined Bachelor of Arts degrees in Philosophy and Fine Arts in 1987. ==Advanced education and early career== Ingrid Mattson received a PhD in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations from the University of Chicago in 1999. She then served as a Professor of Islamic Studies and Christian-Muslim Relations from 1998-2012 at Hartford Seminary in Connecticut. During that period, she founded the first accredited graduate program for Muslim chaplains in America. For a number of years she was also the Director of the MacDonald Center for the Study of Islam and Christian- Muslim Relations at Hartford Seminary. While serving as the vice-president and president of the Islamic Society of North America, Mattson worked on a number of occasions with United States government officials. She provided consultation during the administrations of US Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. This worked focused on policies regarding violent extremism, Muslim-American military service, and protection of civil rights for Muslims- Americans . John O. Brennan, the Director of the CIA, when he was Deputy National Security Advisor for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, and Assistant to President Obama thanked Mattson for her leadership at public meeting at New York University. Her work focuses on fostering positive relationships between groups of differing religious faith. She is an advocate for interfaith engagement and multi-faith activism in the interest of the public good. She has spent her academic career teaching Islamic Studies and interfaith relations in historically Christian institutions. As ISNA president, Mattson established a national office for interfaith relations in Washington, DC in 2006. She invited Rabbi Eric Yoffie, President of the Union for Reform Judaism, to speak at the organization's annual convention in Chicago in 2006. Mattson spoke the next year at the groups Biennial where she received a standing ovation and announced \\"a new partnership that promotes interfaith dialogue and other relationship-building activities\\" between the two organizations. She also established programs with other Jewish organizations. The \\"Twinning Program\\" with the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding is one such program. Another is the three year \\"Jews and Muslims in America\\" program developed in cooperation with the Jewish Theological Seminary and funded by the Carnegie Institute. Mattson has advocated for greater understanding and partnerships between Muslims and Buddhists as well. She shared the stage with the Dalai Lama on a number of occasions, including the \\"Seeds of Peace\\" program in Seattle in 2008, in Indiana in 2010, and in Chicago in 2011. Mattson is an original signatory to \\"A Common Word\\" and has participated in many Christian-Muslim conferences and dialogues with the Jordanian Royal Aal al-Bayt Institute for Islamic Thought. Her leadership in interfaith cooperation has been recognized by Burt Visotzsky of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. She was also awarded an honorary doctorate in 2012 by the Chicago Theological Seminary for her service to the faith community. ==Views on the role of women in Islam== Mattson advocates for a greater public role for Muslim women as religious leaders. When she founded the first accredited graduate program for Muslim chaplains in the US, she insisted that it be open to women. Mattson wears a hijab, but argues that governments should have no authority to enforce religious dress or ban it. Mattson has worked with a Muslim social service agency called Peaceful Families. The group to advocates against domestic violence in the Muslim community and argues against interpretations of the Qur'an that permit violence to or discrimination against women. ==Opposition to Islamic Extremism== Mattson has been a critic of Islamic religious extremism since she first encountered the Taliban while trying to educate Afghan refugee girls in Pakistan. Soon after the September 11 attacks, Mattson published an internet article entitled \\"American Muslims have a Special Obligation.\\" In the article, she stated, \\"I, as an American Muslim leader, denounce not only suicide bombers and the Taliban, but those leaders of other Muslim states who thwart democracy, repress women, use the Qur'an to justify un-Islamic behavior and encourage violence.\\" Since the attacks of September 11, Mattson been interviewed many times on the radio. She has lectured publicly to denounce violence in the name of Islam and advocated for peaceful resolution of conflicts and differences. In a 2007 essay, Mattson condemned \\"Exclusivist, triumphalist, communal identities (religious or political)\\" that justify violent attacks on other groups. Mattson was one of the original signatories of the Amman Message that was an international Muslim response to sectarian violence and terrorism in the name of Islam. ==Publication== Her book, The Story of The Qur'an: its history and place in Muslim Life (now in its 2nd edition) was chosen in 2012 by the National Endowment for the Humanities for inclusion in its \\"Bridging Cultures\\" program. ==Interviews== * On WHYY's \\"Fresh Air\\" with Terry Gross \\"A Convert to Islam Takes Leadership Role,\\" September 28, 2006; * On APM's \\"Speaking of Faith\\" with Krista Tippett \\"A New Voice for Islam,\\" March 6, 2008; * The Spiritual Fallout of 9/11,\\" September 5, 2002; * On WNPR‚Äôs \\"Where We Live\\" with John Dankoski \\"Christians and Muslims,\\" February 13, 2008: * On WNPR's \\"Where We Live\\" with John Dankoski \\"Finding a Religious Common Ground,\\" January 27, 2009: * On CBC's \\"The Sunday Edition\\" with Michael Enright \\"In Search of Moderate Muslims,\\" January 4, 2010: * On WBEZ's Worldview\\" with Jerome McDonnell \\"Muslim Women‚Äôs Leadership,\\" May 4, 2010: ==ReferencesCategory:1963 births Category:Living people Category:People from Kingston, Ontario Category:21st-century Muslim scholars of Islam Category:Muslim reformers Category:Canadian Sunni Muslims Category:University of Waterloo alumni Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Converts to Islam from atheism or agnosticism Category:Canadian expatriates in Pakistan Category:Canadian Muslim activists Category:Women scholars of Islam Category:Former Roman Catholics Category:Critics of Islamism ","title":"Ingrid Mattson"},{"id":"846010","text":"Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) is a communist political party in India.

They are the only earless seals found in tropical climates. The two genera of monk seals, Monachus and Neomonachus, comprise three species: the Mediterranean monk seal, Monachus monachus; the Hawaiian monk seal, Neomonachus schauinslandi; and the Caribbean monk seal, Neomonachus tropicalis, which became extinct in the 20th century. The two surviving species are now rare and in imminent danger of extinction. All three monk seal species were classified in genus Monachus until 2014, when the Caribbean and Hawaiian species were placed into a new genus, Neomonachus. Monk seals have a slender body and are agile. They have a broad, flat snout with nostrils on the top. Monk seals are polygynous, and group together in harems. They feed mainly on bony fish and cephalopods, but they are opportunistic. The skin is covered in small hairs, which are generally black in males and brown or dark gray in females. Monk seals are found in the Hawaiian archipelago, certain areas in the Mediterranean Sea (such as Cabo Blanco and Gyaros island), and formerly in the tropical areas of the west Atlantic Ocean. All species experienced overhunting by sealers. The Hawaiian monk seal experienced population drops in the 19th century and during World War II, and the Caribbean monk seal was exploited since the 1500s until the 1850s, when populations were too low to hunt commercially. The Mediterranean monk seal has experienced commercial hunting since the Middle Ages and eradication by fishermen. Monk seals have developed a fear of humans, and may even abandon beaches due to human presence. Currently, around 1,700 monk seals remain. ==Taxonomy and evolution== Monk seals are earless seals (true seals) of the tribe Monachini. The tribe was first conceived by Victor Blanchard Scheffer in his 1958 book Seals, Sea Lions, and Walruses: A Review of the Pinnipedia. The two genera of monk seals, Monachus and Neomonachus, comprise three species: the Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus), the Hawaiian monk seal (Neomonachus schauinslandi), and the Caribbean monk seal (N. tropicalis), which became extinct in the 20th century. All three monk seal species were classified in genus Monachus until 2014, when comparison of the species' mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA sequences led biologists to place the Caribbean and Hawaiian species in a new genus, Neomonachus. Fossils of the Mediterranean and Caribbean species are known from the Pleistocene. The time of divergence between the Hawaiian and Caribbean species, 3.7 million years ago (Mya), corresponds to the closing of the Central American Seaway by the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. The divergence between Mediterranean seals and the New World clade was dated to 6.3 Mya ago. ==Habitat== Hawaiian monk seal hauled out on volcanic rock The Hawaiian monk seal, as the name suggests, lives solely in the Hawaiian archipelago. Monk seals migrated to Hawaii between 4‚Äì11 Mya through an open-water passage between North and South America called the Central American Seaway. The Isthmus of Panama closed the seaway 3 Mya. The species may have evolved in the Pacific or Atlantic, but in either case, came to Hawaii long before the first Polynesians. When monk seals are not hunting or eating, they generally bask on the beaches; Hawaiian monk seals tend to bask on sandy beaches and volcanic rock of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands. The habitat of the Mediterranean monk seal has changed over the years. Prior to the 20th century, they had been known to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. Since sealing had ended, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for such behavior. More often than not, these caves are rather inaccessible to humans due to underwater entries, and because the caves are often along remote or rugged coastlines. Scientists have confirmed this is a recent adaptation, most likely due to the rapid increase in human population, tourism, and industry, which have caused increased disturbance by humans and the destruction of the species' natural habitat. Because of these seals' shy nature and sensitivity to human disturbance, they have slowly adapted to try to avoid contact with humans completely within the last century, and perhaps, even earlier. The coastal caves are, however, dangerous for newborns, and are causes of major mortality among pups when sea storms hit the caves. Caribbean monk seals were found in warm temperate, subtropical, and tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the west Atlantic Ocean. They probably preferred to haul out at sites (low sandy beaches above high tide) on isolated and secluded atolls and islands, but occasionally visited the mainland coasts and deeper waters offshore. This species may have fed in shallow lagoons and reefs. ==Description== Hawaiian monk seal swimming (note the red eyes are due to the red-eye effect) Monk seals are part of the family Phocidae (earless seals), the members of which are characterized by their lack of external ears, the inability to rotate the hind flippers under the body, and shed their hair and the outer layer of their skin in an annual molt. Monk seals as a whole vary minutely in size, with all adults measuring on average and . They exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the males are slightly larger than females, with the exception of the Hawaiian monk seal, where females are larger. Its white belly, gray coat, and slender physique distinguish it from the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), another earless seal. Much like elephant seals, they shed their hair and the outer layer of their skin in an annual molt. The Mediterranean monk seal has a short, broad, and flat snout, with very pronounced, long nostrils that face upwards. The flippers are relatively short, with small, slender claws. The monk seal's physique is ideally suited for hunting its prey: fish, octopus, lobster, and squid in deep-water coral beds. The fur coats of males is generally black, and brown or dark gray in females. Pups are about long and weigh around , their skin being covered by fur, usually dark brown or black. On their bellies, a white stripe occurs, which differs in color between the two sexes. This hair is replaced after 6‚Äì8 weeks by the usual short hair adults carry. Mediterranean monk seal skeleton The Hawaiian monk seal (whose Hawaiian name means \\"the dog that runs in rough waters\\") has a short, broad, and flat snout, with long nostrils that face forward. It has a relatively small, flat head with large, black eyes, eight pairs of teeth, and a short snout with the nostrils on top of the snout and vibrissae on each side. The nostrils are small, vertical slits, which close when the seal dives under water. Additionally, their slender, torpedo-shaped body and hind flippers allow them to be very agile swimmers. Adult males are in weight and in length, while adult females tend to be, typically, slightly larger, at and in length. When monk seal pups are born, they weigh and are in length. As they nurse for about 6 weeks, they grow considerably, eventually weighing between by the time they are weaned, while the mother loses up to . Caribbean monk seals had a relatively large, long, robust body, and could grow to nearly in length and weighed . Males were probably slightly larger than females, which is similar to Mediterranean monk seals. Like other monk seals, this species had a distinctive head and face. The head was rounded with an extended, broad muzzle. The face had relatively large, wide-spaced eyes, upward-opening nostrils, and fairly big whisker pads with long, light-colored, and smooth whiskers. When compared to the body, the animal's foreflippers were relatively short with little claws and the hindflippers were slender. Their coloration was brownish and/or grayish, with the underside lighter than the dorsal area. Adults were darker than the paler and more yellowish younger seals. Caribbean monk seals were also known to have algae growing on their pelages, giving them a slightly greenish appearance, which is similar to Hawaiian monk seals. ==Behavior== ===Diet and predation=== Hawaiian monk seals mainly prey on reef-dwelling bony fish, but they also prey on cephalopods and crustaceans. Juveniles and subadults prey more on smaller octopus species, such as Octopus leteus and O. hawaiiensis (nocturnal octopus species), and eels than do adult Hawaiian monk seals. Adult seals feed mostly on larger octopus species such as O. cyanea. Hawaiian monk seals have a broad and diverse diet due to foraging plasticity, which allows them to be opportunistic predators that feed on a wide variety of available prey. Tiger sharks, great white sharks, and Galapagos sharks are both predators of the Hawaiian monk seal. Mediterranean monk seals are diurnal and feed on a variety of fish and mollusks, primarily octopus, squid, and eels, up to per day. They are known to forage mostly at depths of , but some have been observed by NOAA submersibles at a depth of . They prefer hunting in wide-open spaces, enabling them to use their speed more effectively. They are successful bottom-feeding hunters; some have even been observed lifting slabs of rock in search of prey. They have no natural predators. ===Reproduction and development=== Two young Hawaiian monk seals Very little is known of the Mediterranean monk seal's reproduction. They are thought to be polygynous, with males being very territorial where they mate with females. Although no breeding season exists, since births take place year round, a peak occurs in October and November. This is also the time when caves are prone to wash out due to high surf or storm surge, which causes high mortality rates among pups, especially at the key Cabo Blanco colony. Pups make first contact with the water 2 weeks after their birth and are weaned around 18 weeks of age; females caring for pups go off to feed for an average of 9 hours. Most individuals are believed to reach maturity at 4 years of age. The gestation period lasts close to a year. However, monk seals of the Cabo Blanco colony may have a gestation period lasting slightly longer than a year. Mediterranean monk seals generally live to be 25 to 30 years old. Hawaiian monk seals are polygynous. The breeding season takes place throughout the year, excluding the fall, but peaks during April and May. Shark attacks cause a high pup mortality, from 19% to 39%. Pups are thought to be weaned around 6 weeks and reach sexual maturity at 3 years. Their typical lifespan is 25 to 30 years. Not much is known of the Caribbean monk seal's reproduction. They likely bore a single pup every two years. Their gestation period, lactation period, and sexual maturity age are unknown. ==Interactions with humans== ===Hawaii=== Hawaiian monk seal sleeping on a beach in Kauai Hawaiian monk seal swimming above a coral reef Young monk seal underwater ====Threats==== In the 19th century, many seals were killed by whalers and sealers for meat, oil, and skin. U.S. military forces hunted them during World War II, while occupying Laysan Island and Midway Island. Human disturbances have had immense effects on the populations of the Hawaiian monk seal. They tend to avoid beaches where they are disturbed; after continual disturbance, the seals may completely abandon the beach, thus reducing habitat size, subsequently limiting population growth. For instance, large beach crowds and beach structures limit the seal's habitat. The WWII military bases in the northwestern islands were closed, but minimal human activities can be enough to disturb the species. The current population is only around 1,400 individuals. The Hawaiian monk seal has the lowest level of genetic variability among the 18 pinniped species, allegedly due to a population bottleneck caused by intense hunting in the 19th century. This limited genetic variability reduces the species's ability to adapt to environmental pressures and limits natural selection, thus increasing their risk of extinction. Given the monk seal's small population, the effects of disease could be disastrous. Entanglement can result in mortality, because when the seals get trapped in marine debris such as fishing nets, they cannot maneuver or reach the surface to breathe. Marine fisheries can potentially interact with monk seals by direct and indirect relationships. Directly, the seal can become snared by fishing equipment, entangled in discarded debris, and even feed on fish refuse. International law prohibits the intentional discarding of debris from ships at sea. Monk seals have one of the highest documented rates of entanglement of any pinniped species. ====Conservation==== In 1909, Theodore Roosevelt created the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge (HINWR), which is under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Throughout the 1980s, the National Marine Fisheries Service completed various versions of an environmental impact statement that designated the Northwest Hawaiian Islands as a critical habitat for the Hawaiian monk seal. The designation prohibited lobster fishing in the northwest Hawaiian Islands and Laysan Island. In 2006, a Presidential proclamation established the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, which incorporated the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, the HINWR, and the Battle of Midway National Memorial, thus creating the largest marine protected area in the world and affording the Hawaiian monk seal further protection. NOAA cultivated a network of volunteers to protect the seals while they bask or bear and nurse their young. NOAA is funding considerable research on seal population dynamics and health in conjunction with the Marine Mammal Center. From NOAA, several programs and networks were formed. Community programs such as PIRO have helped to improve community standards for the Hawaiian monk seal. The program also creates networks with the native Hawaiians on the island to network more people in the fight for conservation of the seals. The Marine Mammal Response Network is partnered with NOAA and several other government agencies that deal with land and marine wildlife.Protected Resources Division.\\" NOAA. N.p., n.d. Web. 21 Oct. 2013. To raise awareness of the species' plight, on June 11, 2008, a state law designated the Hawaiian monk seal as Hawaii's official state mammal. ===Mediterranean=== One of the first sightings of a monk seal in the Strait of Gibraltar, 2012 ====Threats==== Several causes provoked a dramatic population decrease over time: on one hand, commercial hunting (especially during the Roman Empire and Middle Ages) and during the 20th century, eradication by fishermen, who used to consider it a pest due to the damage the seal causes to fishing nets when it preys on fish caught in them; and on the other hand, coastal urbanization and pollution. Currently, its entire population is estimated to be less than 600 individuals scattered throughout a wide distribution range, which qualifies this species as endangered. Its current very sparse population is one more serious threat to the species, as it only has two key sites that can be deemed viable. One is the Aegean Sea (250‚Äì300 animals in Greece, with the largest concentration of animals on Gyaros, and some 100 in Turkey); the other important subpopulation is the Western Saharan portion of Cabo Blanco (around 200 individuals which may support the small, but growing, nucleus in the Desertas Islands ‚Äì roughly 20 individuals). Some individuals may be using coastal areas along other parts of Western Sahara, such as in Cintra Bay. These two key sites are virtually in the extreme opposites of the species' distribution range, which makes natural population interchange between them impossible. All the other remaining subpopulations are composed of less than 50 mature individuals, many of them being only loose groups of extremely reduced size ‚Äì often less than five individuals. Consequently, low genetic variability exists. A colony of Mediterranean monk seals on Cabo Blanco, 1945 Cabo Blanco, in the Atlantic Ocean, is the largest surviving single population of the species, and the only remaining site that still seems to preserve a colony structure. In the summer of 1997, a disease killed more than 200 animals (two-thirds of its population) within 2 months, extremely compromising the species' viable population. While opinions on the precise causes of this epidemic remain divided, the most likely cause is a morbilivirus or a toxic algae bloom. ====Conservation==== In the Aegean Sea, Greece has allocated a large area for the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal and its habitat. The Greek Alonissos Marine Park, that extends around the Northern Sporades islands, is the main action ground of the Greek MOm organisation. MOm is greatly involved in raising awareness in the general public, fundraising for the helping of the monk seal preservation cause, in Greece and wherever needed. Greece is currently investigating the possibility of declaring another monk seal breeding site as a national park, and also has integrated some sites in the NATURA 2000 protection scheme. The legislation in Greece is very strict towards seal hunting, and in general, the public is very much aware and supportive of the effort for the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal. One of the largest groups among the foundations concentrating their efforts towards the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal is the Mediterranean Seal Research Group (Akdeniz Foklarƒ±nƒ± Ara≈ütƒ±rma Grubu) operating under the Underwater Research Foundation (Sualtƒ± Ara≈ütƒ±rmalarƒ± Derneƒüi) in Turkey (also known as SAD-AFAG). The group has taken initiative in joint preservation efforts together with the Fo√ßa municipal officials, as well as phone, fax, and email hotlines for sightings. ===Caribbean=== Caribbean monk seal in the New York Aquarium, 1910 The extinction of the Caribbean monk seal was mainly triggered by overhunting in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to obtain the oil held within their blubber, fueled by the large demand for seal products. As early as 1688, sugar plantation owners sent out hunting parties to kill hundreds of seals every night for blubber oil to lubricate machinery. The Caribbean monk seals‚Äô docile nature and lack of an instinctive fear of humans made it an easy target, and hunting only ended (in the 1850s) because the population was too low for commercial use.Gray, J (1850). Catalogue of the Specimens of Mammalia in the Collection of the British Museum. London. p. v. Overfishing of the reefs that sustained the Caribbean monk seal population also contributed to their extinction. Fish stock decline in the Caribbean starved the remaining populations. Little was done to protect the Caribbean monk seal; by the time it was placed on the endangered species list in 1967, it was likely already extinct. == Further reading == * * ==References== ==External links== * The Monachus Guardian * Monk Seal Foundation * NOAA Monk Seal Info Category:True seals Category:Monachines ","title":"Monk seal"},{"id":"846039","text":"Barry Kay (1932 - 1985) was an Australian-born stage and costume designer of international renown. After having studied painting at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris and theatre design in Melbourne, he settled in London in 1956. In the course of his career, lasting almost four decades, he designed for the ballet, opera and theatre alike, working with established directors and choreographers at major theatres and opera houses and their companies worldwide. Kay's emphasis lay in pioneering three-dimensional stage set designs for the ballet. By breaking away from the traditional use of \\"flat wings\\" scenery, in designing for the theatre he expanded on the revolutionary ideas of the Russian Constructivists and the Italian Futurists in the early part of the 20th century. Among others, he designed for the choreographers Walter Gore, Peter Darrell, Kenneth MacMillan and Rudolf Nureyev, as well as for ballet companies such as Western Theatre Ballet (now Scottish Ballet), The Royal Ballet, The Australian Ballet, the Ballet of the Deutsche Oper Berlin,Following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the German Reunification, the ballet companies of both the 'Deutsche Oper' (formerly West Berlin) and the 'Staatsoper' (formerly East Berlin) have merged on 1 January 2004, operating at both opera houses under the new name of 'Staatsballett Berlin', the Stuttgart Ballet, the Vienna State Opera Ballet, Le Ballet de l'Op√©ra de Paris and American Ballet Theatre. Some of the drama and opera directors for whom he worked included Margaret Webster, Colin Graham, John Copley, Peter Dews and Rudolf Hartmann - with productions staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Old Vic, London; Sadler's Wells Opera Company (since 1974 English National Opera), Sadler's Wells Theatre, London; The Royal Opera at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London; and numerous other national and international houses. Later in his career Kay also became a photographer of subjects with socio-anthropological contents. His photo essay As a Woman, published in 1976, is an extensive portrait of the unique transvestite and transsexual community of Sydney, Australia. Kay's artistic contributions to the performing arts are well represented and documented at national museums, state galleries, art libraries, theatre collections and archives globally. Public collections include: the Performing Arts Collection, Arts Centre, Melbourne; Victoria & Albert Museum Theatre Collections, London; Royal Opera House Collections, London; National Gallery of Australia, Canberra; National Library of Australia, Canberra; State Library of New South Wales, Mitchell Library, Sydney; Lipperheidesche Kost√ºmbibliothek, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin; √ñsterreichisches Theatermuseum, Vienna; University of Calgary, Library, Special Collections, Alberta, Canada; MacNay Museum, Tobin Collection of Theatre Arts, San Antonio, Texas.

The Mersey River is a river on the north-west coast of Tasmania, Australia. The city of Devonport is situated at the river's mouth on Bass Strait. The source of this river is Lake Meston. From here the river feeds itself into Lake Youd. Lees Creek is a tributary to the Mersey River and it feeds into Lake Orion, Lake Merope, Lake Eros, Lake Artemis and Junction Lake prior to the Mersey. Feather Creek from Cathedral Mountain is a tributary to the Mersey River at this point. Campfire Creek is the next tributary. The Mersey flows into Lake Rowallan. The Rowallan Power Station, part of the Rowallan Dam is a hydro-electric station is also located on the Mersey. Fish Creek is also a tributary to Lake Rowallan. The Mersey then flows to Lake Parangana. Lake Parangana also takes inflows from the Fisher River, this has a tributary of the little Fisher River and Fisher River flows through Lake MacKenzie and the Fisher Power Station which also has a tributary from Explorer Creek which is fed from Lake Explorer. Water from Lake Parangana is transferred west via tunnels to Lemonthyme Power Station. The water runs into Lake Cethana. The Mersey River continues to flow from Lake Parangana through Parangana Power Station and takes in Overflow Creek and Mole Creek as its tributaries.

The flood resulted in significant damage to bridges and other riverside infrastructure, as well as extensive erosion of the river bank and uprooting of trees, leading to numerous logjams in narrow gorges such as at Big Bend. These logjams were so extensive that the many kayakers who use the river were required to portage around them to travel downstream. ==Recreation== Anglers along the Mersey The Mersey is a popular trout fishing stream holding brown and rainbow trout.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a left fielder from to , most notably as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers who were known as the Robins at that time. After 18 seasons in Brooklyn, he played his final season with the Philadelphia Athletics. Wheat spent the first part of his career playing in the Dead ball era. Although he threw right-handed, Wheat was a left-handed batter who hit over .300 in 13 seasons and won the National League batting championship in 1918. He ended his career with a .317 career batting average and remains the Dodgers all-time franchise leader in hits, doubles, triples, RBI, and total bases. He was also known as a stylish and graceful outfielder, leading National League left fielders in putouts seven times and fielding percentage twice. Wheat was unanimously elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1959. His brother McKinley \\"Mack\\" Wheat also played in the major leagues, and the two were teammates in Brooklyn for five seasons. ==Career== Born in Hamilton, Missouri, he was the son of Basil and Julia Wheat. His father was of English descent, and his mother was a full-blooded Cherokee. Wheat began his professional baseball career in for Enterprise in the Kansas League, followed by Wichita in , Shreveport Pirates of the Texas League in , and to round out his minor league career, he played for the Mobile Sea Gulls of the Southern Association in . It was during that 1909 season that the Brooklyn Superbas of the National League purchased Wheat for $1200, and he made his major league debut in September. He batted with a corkscrew type of swing, and held his hands down near the end of the bat, unlike most hitters during his time, a time noted as the \\"Dead Ball Era\\". Even with his consistent high levels of hitting, he was also noted for his graceful and stylish defense. Wheat played his first full season in . He played every game for the Superbas that season as the regular left fielder, leading the league in games played. He batted .284 that season, the second-lowest average of his career, which led the team, and was among the league leaders in hits, doubles, and triples. It was in that his reputation as a slugger began to take hold. Along with hitting .287, he finished eighth in the league with 13 triples, and slugged five home runs. In an era when players rarely hit double-digit home runs for a season, five was enough for people to take notice. Wheat continued his steady and consistent climb up the batting charts in , hitting .305, and finished the season among the league leaders in home runs and slugging percentage. Over the next four seasons, he continued to be among the leaders of many offensive categories including home runs, batting average, slugging average, hits, doubles, triples, and RBIs. It was during the 1912 season that Wheat married Daisy Kerr Forsman, and she became his default agent, encouraging him to hold out for a better contract each season. Players in his day generally signed one-year contracts before every season. Each time Wheat held out, he received more money, the club not wanting to lose one of its best hitters and the team's most popular player. This tactic of threatening to hold out served him well during throughout his career, including during the World War I era, when he raised and sold mules to the United States Army as pack animals. He claimed that he did so well, that he didn't need to play during the summer. The team, fearing that they might lose a great player during the prime of his career, succumbed to his demands every year. Zack Wheat baseball card, 1911 Gold Borders (T205) In , he topped off the string of seasons with a finish in the top ten in all the above categories, topping the league in total bases and slugging. He also had a career-high hitting streak, which reached 29 games. The Brooklyn Robins won the National League pennant that season. In the World Series, they faced the Boston Red Sox, which had the formidable pitching rotation of Ernie Shore, Dutch Leonard, Carl Mays, and Babe Ruth. The Red Sox won the series four games to one, holding the Robins to a .200 batting average, and Wheat to a paltry .211. During the and seasons, Wheat hit well, but missed many games due to injuries. He had tiny feet, size 5, and this is believed to be the cause of the many nagging ankle injuries that caused to miss many games in his career. However, he led the league in batting average for the only time in his career with a .335 batting average, his highest average up to that point. For a player known as a slugger, and consistently in the top ten in most offensive categories including home runs, he hit none that season, and just one the season prior. Not until Rod Carew in would another player win a batting title without hitting a home run during the season. Starting in , Wheat returned to the league slugging leaders once again, as the baseball began to become livelier, proved by the offensive output by the likes of Ruth and Rogers Hornsby. The Robins made their second World Series appearance in , this time facing off against the Cleveland Indians. The Robins lost this series as well, 5 games to 2, although Wheat's series average was .333. Wheat's statistics climbed during this new live era of baseball, reaching double-digit home runs for the first time with 14 in , and again three more times in the next four years. Wheat hit .320 or higher every season from 1920 through , topping out with .375 in consecutive seasons. He failed to lead the league in hitting those two seasons, not getting enough at bats in to qualify, and Hornsby topped the league with .384, and in , his .375 was a distant second to Hornsby's .424. A subtle, but longstanding friction existed between Wheat and his manager, Wilbert Robinson. The friction reportedly stemmed from Robinson's belief that Wheat pursued the manager's job behind his back. When owner Charles Ebbets died in , new team president Ed McKeever reassigned Robinson into the front office and named Wheat as player-manager. Newspapers confirm that he managed the Dodgers for two weeks. McKeever caught pneumonia at Ebbets' funeral, and died soon afterward, and Robinson quickly returned to the manager's position. As it turned out, Wheat never again managed in the majors, much to his disappointment. Moreover, Wheat's 1925 managerial stint never made it into the official records. In , Steve McKeever, Ed's brother, hired Wheat as a coach, leading to widespread speculation that he was being groomed for the manager's spot, threatening Robinson's job for a second time in seven years, and he treated his former star as coldly as ever. Wheat was signed by the Philadelphia Athletics after his release from Brooklyn in . After the season, he was released again; this time he signed and played for the minor league Minneapolis Millers of the American Association. He played very little that season due to a heel injury, and retired from playing following the season. He still holds the Dodger franchise records for hits, doubles, triples and total bases. ==Career statistics== In 2,410 games over 19 seasons, Wheat posted a .317 batting average (2,884-for-9,106) with 1,289 runs, 476 doubles, 172 triples, 132 home runs, 1,248 RBI, 205 stolen bases, 650 bases on balls, .367 on-base percentage and .450 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .966 fielding percentage as a left fielder. In 12 World Series games (1916,1920), he batted .283 (13-for-46) with 4 runs, 2 doubles, 1 triple, 3 RBI and 3 walks. ==Post-career== After Wheat retired from baseball, he moved back to his farm in Polo, Missouri, until the Great Depression forced him to sell it in 1932. He moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where he operated a bowling alley with Cotton Tierney. He later became a police officer. It was during his duties as an officer in 1936, that he was chasing a fleeing felon in his vehicle, when he crashed and nearly died. Wheat spent five months in hospital after the accident, and after he was discharged, he moved his family to Sunrise Beach, Missouri, a resort town on the Lake of the Ozarks, to recuperate. It was here that he opened a hunting and fishing resort. Wheat was first voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1957, but could not be inducted because he had not been retired for the required 30 years. The committee unanimously elected him in 1959. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time. In 2006, the stretch of Route 13 that runs through Caldwell County, Missouri was named the Zach Wheat Memorial Highway. Due to his Cherokee ancestry, Wheat was featured in \\"Baseball's League of Nations: A Tribute to Native Americans in Baseball\\", a 2008 exhibit at the Iroquois Indian Museum in Howes Cave, N.Y.

Recorded at Trax East Recording Studio in South River, New Jersey, it was produced by engineer Steve Evetts with the band's guitarist Ben Weinman and drummer Chris Pennie, and released on September 28, 1999 by Relapse Records. The album is the band's only full-length album to feature original vocalist Dimitri Minakakis, who left the band in 2001. Media response to Calculating Infinity was positive, with critics praising the aggressive nature of the album's material, as well as the complexity of the arrangement and instrumental work. Several publications have highlighted it as a landmark release in The Dillinger Escape Plan's catalogue and in hardcore punk and heavy metal as a whole. They also credited its influence on the genres and on the work of several subsequent bands. While exploring hardcore punk, the record is also classified as metalcore, experimental metal, and grindcore, in addition to being highlighted as one of the first mathcore albums. Its lyrical themes mostly revolve around failing relationships and insecurity. By 2013, Calculating Infinity had sold in excess of 100,000 copies worldwide. == Background == In 1998 the band wrote and recorded an EP titled Under the Running Board. During this time period, The Dillinger Escape Plan gained notoriety in the hardcore punk scene for the intensity of their performances which were increasingly wild, and often violent. These features, as well as the creative, technical approach of their music led a record executive of Relapse Records to offer the band a multi-record contract. Shortly after the EP, rhythm guitarist John Fulton left the band to focus on his computer programming studies. ==Recording and production== Recording for Calculating Infinity took place in March, April and June 1999 at Trax East Recording Studio in South River, New Jersey, with production led by Steve Evetts alongside the band's lead guitarist Ben Weinman and drummer Chris Pennie. The recording process has been described by Weinman as \\"extremely difficult\\" due to technological limitations, and resulted in an album with which he initially felt \\"very unhappy\\". In an interview with Decibel magazine, the guitarist added: \\"In the studio it was really hard, because at the time we didn't use Pro Tools and did everything to tape\\". The group also ran out of money during the process, resorting to trading their individual publishing rights for the songs to their label Relapse Records in return for $2,000 to complete the recording. Speaking about the decision, Weinman commented: \\"We weren't thinking about the future, just the present and how this record had to rule\\"; vocalist Dimitri Minakakis agreed: \\"We weren't focused on what the record could possibly do; we just wanted a record we were happy with\\", adding that it was a decision agreed by every member of the band. The band's original bassist Adam Doll was unable to contribute to the recording of Calculating Infinity after suffering a spinal fracture in a road traffic accident shortly before recording began, forcing guitarist Ben Weinman to handle all guitar and bass duties. Speaking to Kerrang! about Doll's injury, Weinman described it as \\"a life-changing moment\\" for the band, adding: \\"It was difficult to think about moving forward, but I felt he would get better and I wanted to make something for him to come back to\\". Rhythm guitarist Brian Benoit joined the band partway through the recording process and contributed additional guitar recordings to a handful of tracks, as well as writing a guitar part on \\"Clip the Apex... Accept Instruction\\" and assisting with vocal arrangements on \\"Variations on a Cocktail Dress\\". When asked whether the band considered delaying the recording of the album until Benoit was \\"fully integrated\\" into the band, Weinman responded: \\"The idea was ... for us to progress and build on what we had done\\" rather than \\"stopping our progression waiting for someone else to catch up\\"; Benoit also commented: \\"I knew my role, which was getting up to par live\\". ==Promotion and release== Calculating Infinity was released on September 28, 1999, with Relapse Records issuing it on CD and Hydra Head Records releasing a vinyl edition. The album was released later in Japan on April 5, 2000 featuring bonus tracks \\"The Mullet Burden\\", \\"Sandbox Magician\\" and \\"Abe the Cop\\", all of which were originally featured on the band's second extended play Under the Running Board in 1998. In promotion of the album, the band (with temporary bassist Jeff Wood) toured in support of American experimental rock group Mr. Bungle after receiving an invitation from their frontman Mike Patton, as well as appeared on the Warped Tour and at various festivals. Patton was reportedly introduced to the band after being given the album, however Weinman has clarified that the vocalist was familiar with the band prior to this and was \\"one of the first people to ever hear\\" the album in order to provide feedback. Calculating Infinity was reissued on vinyl alongside 2004's Miss Machine and 2007's Ire Works on November 27, 2015, marking the first time in more than ten years the album had been released on the format. The album reportedly sold in excess of 100,000 units worldwide, which made The Dillinger Escape Plan the highest-selling artist on Relapse at the time. ==Composition and lyrics== Commentators have primarily categorised Calculating Infinity as mathcore due to its frequent use of complex time signatures, atypical rhythms and unpredictable tempo changes. Many have claimed that The Dillinger Escape Plan \\"pioneered\\" or even \\"created\\" the genre with the release of their debut album. Others have described the album's style as metalcore, experimental metal, hardcore punk, and grindcore. Speaking to The Independent, the band's guitarist Weinman suggested that the challenging nature of the album's material was intentional, explaining that \\"Calculating Infinity was us effectively ripping up the music theory book; if someone said 'don't harmonize with a second, it just sounds out of tune', then every single lead we did, we'd harmonize with a second. It sounded disgusting, but we did it\\". Natalie Zina Walschots of Exclaim! described the album's style as \\"even more avant-garde\\" than the band's first two extended plays, which she had noted featuring \\"complex and technical guitar work\\", \\"unpredictable shifts in tempo and tone\\" and \\"fractured song structures\\". Decibel writer Daniel Lake described the album as a combination of \\"gouts of noise, rhythmic chaos, jazzy runs and cinematic interludes\\". According to vocalist Dimitri Minakakis, the majority of the lyrical content on Calculating Infinity is based on his experience in dysfunctional relationships. Speaking to Decibel magazine, Minakakis explained that \\"Most of my Dillinger lyrics were predicated on myself ... I just had stupid relationships with idiotic people, and I'd just write a song about it\\", concluding that \\"most of the lyrics on Calculating Infinity were based on human insecurity. That's where I got the best material.\\" The album's title was suggested by guitarist Brian Benoit, who recalled to Decibel: \\"Since so much of the material lyrically was about failing relationships, I kind of took it as a \\"love not lasting forever\\" sort of thing ... Obviously, forever ‚Äì or infinity ‚Äì isn't going to happen ... so let's see how long we can calculate before this blows up in our face.\\" ==Reception and legacy== Media response to Calculating Infinity was positive. AllMusic writer Jason Hundey described that the album \\"spews forth anger and venomous misery in a way that is comparable only to spontaneous combustion\\", adding that it expands upon \\"the ultra-aggressive, deliciously technical approach they adopt toward grind and hardcore\\". Hundey praised the release for being \\"both screechingly abrasive ... and morbidly beautiful\\", dubbing it \\"explosive and brilliant\\" and highlighting the tracks \\"43% Burnt\\" and \\"Weekend Sex Change\\". Decibel magazine's Kevin Stewart-Panko wrote: \\"Regardless of what you think about Calculating Infinity, you can't deny that the 11 tracks on this album revolutionized extreme music and raised the bar in terms of technicality, musicianship, speed, dynamics,\\" describing it as a \\"groundbreaking metallic hardcore album\\". The CMJ New Music Report noted that \\"this noisy album is almost painful to listen to, but it's compelling enough to turn you into a happy masochist.\\" Terrorizer magazine ranked the album as the 15th best release of the year, while Metal Hammer also included it in a retrospective top ten list for 1999 published in 2017. Calculating Infinity has since been lauded as a landmark release for the band and the genre. Rolling Stone ranked it the 56th greatest metal album of all-time in a 2017 feature, praising the release for featuring \\"an underlying logic, [and] a sense of structure that lifted songs ... to a realm above the noise and fury of everyday hardcore\\". Metal Hammer columnist Stephen Hill claimed that the album \\"changed the face of metal\\" and demonstrated that the members of the band were \\"serious and inventive musicians, not just one dimensional noisemongers\\". Writing for MetalSucks, Amy Sciaretto suggested that Calculating Infinity was the album \\"that made Dillinger so revered by the metal underground, and obviously, those listening to metal\\", while Alternative Press writer Colin McGuire described the album as \\"one of the most influential collections of experimental metal the genre has seen in the last two decades\\". Metal Injection ranked Calculating Infinity as the sixth best debut album in heavy metal in a 2016 feature, while Loudwire included the album at number ten on a similar list, with writer Graham Hartmann hailing it as \\"the most spastic, mathematical, chaotic and contradicting metal album ever released\\". Loudwire later listed the record third on their list of \\"25 Best Metalcore albums of all-time\\". ==Track listing== Credits adapted from the liner notes of Calculating Infinity. Songwriting credits were not printed in the album's sleeve but they can be obtained through an ASCAP database search. Track 11, \\"Variations on a Cocktail Dress\\", contains about three minutes of silence, followed by a hidden track with samples from the 1959 film The Diary of Anne Frank. ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of Calculating Infinity. ;The Dillinger Escape Plan *Dimitri Minakakis ‚Äì vocals *Ben Weinman ‚Äì guitar, bass *Brian Benoit ‚Äì guitar *Chris Pennie ‚Äì drums, keyboards ;Production *Ben Weinman ‚Äì production *Chris Pennie ‚Äì production *Steve Evetts ‚Äì production, engineering *Aaron Harris ‚Äì engineering assistance *Jason Hellmann ‚Äì engineering assistance *Alan Douches ‚Äì mastering *Adam Peterson ‚Äì graphic design *Paul Delia ‚Äì photography *Scott Kinkade ‚Äì additional photography ==References== ==External links== * Category:1999 debut albums Category:The Dillinger Escape Plan albums Category:Relapse Records albums Category:Hydra Head Records albums Category:Albums produced by Steve Evetts ","title":"Calculating Infinity"},{"id":"846084","text":"A Room of One's Own is an extended essay by Virginia Woolf, first published in September 1929. For a different date, see The work is based on two lectures Woolf delivered in October 1928 at Newnham College and Girton College, women's constituent colleges at the University of Cambridge. An important feminist text, the essay is noted in its argument for both a literal and figurative space for women‚Äôs writers within a literary tradition dominated by men. ==History== The essay was based on two papers Woolf read on 20 and 26 October 1928 to two Cambridge student societies, the Newnham Arts Society at Newnham College and the ODTAA Society at Girton College, respectively. Elsie Duncan- Jones, then known as Elsie Phare, was the president of the Newnham Arts Society at the time and wrote an account of the paper, \\"Women and Fiction\\", for the college magazine, Thersites. Woolf stayed at Newnham at the invitation of Pernel Strachey, the college principal, whose family were key members of the Bloomsbury Group. At Girton she was accompanied by Vita Sackville- West.Tullberg, Rita McWilliams (2004). \\"Strachey, (Joan) Pernel (1876‚Äì1951)\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. It was published in 1929 as a book with six chapters.\\"A Room of One's Own\\", British Library. ==Themes== ===The Four Marys=== The title of the essay comes from Woolf's conception that \\"a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction\\". The narrator of the work is referred to early on: \\"Here then was I (call me Mary Beton, Mary Seton, Mary Carmichael or by any name you please‚Äîit is not a matter of any importance)\\". The two Marys were ladies-in-waiting to Mary, Queen of Scots; they are also characters in a 16th-century Scottish ballad, Mary Hamilton, about a lady-in-waiting who is facing execution for having had a child with the King, a child she killed.Shiach, Morag (ed.) (2008). \\"Introduction\\", in Virginia Woolf. A Room of One's Own: And, Three Guineas. Oxford University Press, p. 5\\\\. In referencing the tale of a woman who rejected motherhood and lived outside marriage, a woman about to be hanged, the narrator identifies women writers such as herself as outsiders who exist in a potentially dangerous space. ===Women's access to education=== Woolf in 1927 The essay examines whether women were capable of producing, and in fact free to produce, work of the quality of William Shakespeare, addressing the limitations that past and present women writers face. Woolf's father, Sir Leslie Stephen, in line with the thinking of the era, believed that only the boys of the family should be sent to school. In delivering the lectures outlined in the essay, Woolf is speaking to women who have the opportunity to learn in a formal setting. She moves her audience to understand the importance of their education, while warning them of the precariousness of their position in society. She sums up the stark contrast between how women are idealised in fiction written by men, and how patriarchal society has treated them in real life: > Women have burnt like beacons in all the works of all the poets from the > beginning of time. Indeed if woman had no existence save in the fiction > written by men, one would imagine her a person of the utmost importance; > very various; heroic and mean; splendid and sordid; beautiful and hideous in > the extreme; as great as a man, some would say greater. But this is woman in > fiction. In fact, as Professor Trevelyan points out, she was locked up, > beaten and flung about the room. A very queer, composite being thus emerges. > Imaginatively she is of the highest importance; practically she is > completely insignificant. She pervades poetry from cover to cover; she is > all but absent from history. She dominates the lives of kings and conquerors > in fiction; in fact she was the slave of any boy whose parents forced a ring > upon her finger. Some of the most inspired words and profound thoughts in > literature fall from her lips; in real life she could hardly read; scarcely > spell; and was the property of her husband. ====Judith Shakespeare==== Newnham College, Cambridge In one section Woolf invents a fictional character, Judith, Shakespeare's sister, to illustrate that a woman with Shakespeare's gifts would have been denied the opportunity to develop them. Like Woolf, who stayed at home while her brothers went off to school, Judith is trapped in the home: \\"She was as adventurous, as imaginative, as agog to see the world as he was. But she was not sent to school.\\" While William learns, Judith is chastised by her parents should she happen to pick up a book, as she is inevitably abandoning some household chore to which she could be attending. Judith is betrothed, and when she does not want to marry, her father beats her, then shames her into the marriage. While William establishes himself, Judith is trapped by what is expected of women. She runs away from home to London, is harassed and laughed at when she tries to become an actor, and is finally made pregnant by an actor-manager who said he would help her. She kills herself and \\"lies buried at some cross-roads where the omnibuses now stop outside the Elephant and Castle\\". William lives on and establishes his legacy. ===Building a history of women's writing=== Girton College, Cambridge In the essay, Woolf constructs a critical and historical account of women writers thus far. Woolf examines the careers of several female authors, including Aphra Behn, Jane Austen, the Bront√´ sisters, Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea, and George Eliot. In addition to female authors, Woolf also discusses and draws inspiration from noted scholar and feminist Jane Ellen Harrison. Harrison is presented in the essay only by her initials separated by long dashes, and Woolf first introduces Harrison as \\"the famous scholar, could it be J---- H---- herself?\\" Woolf also discusses Rebecca West, questioning Desmond MacCarthy's (referred to as \\"Z\\") uncompromising dismissal of West as an \\"'arrant feminist'\\". Among the men attacked for their views on women, F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead (referred to as \\"Lord Birkenhead\\") is mentioned, although Woolf further rebukes his ideas in stating she will not \\"trouble to copy out Lord Birkenhead's opinion upon the writing of women\\". Birkenhead was an opponent of suffrage. The essay quotes Oscar Browning, through the words of his (possibly inaccurate) biographer H. E. Wortham, \\"that the impression left on his mind, after looking over any set of examination papers, was that, irrespective of the marks he might give, the best woman was intellectually the inferior of the worst man\\". In addition to these mentions, Woolf subtly refers to several of the most prominent intellectuals of the time; her hybrid name for the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge‚ÄîOxbridge‚Äîhas become a well-known term, although she was not the first to use it. ===Lesbianism=== Vita Sackville-West accompanied Woolf to the Girton lecture. Woolf wrote in her diary before A Room of One's Own was published that she thought when it was published she would be \\"attacked for a feminist & hinted at for a sapphist\\" [sapphist means lesbian]. In one section of the book, describing the work of a fictional woman writer, Mary Carmichael, Woolf deliberately invokes lesbianism: \\"Then may I tell you that the very next words I read were these ‚Äì 'Chloe liked Olivia ...' Do not start. Do not blush. Let us admit in the privacy of our own society that these things sometimes happen. Sometimes women do like women.\\" Woolf references the obscenity trial and public uproar resulting from the publishing of Radclyffe Hall's lesbian-themed novel The Well of Loneliness (1928). Before she can discuss Chloe liking Olivia, the narrator has to be assured that Sir Chartres Biron, the magistrate of Hall's obscenity trial, is not in the audience: \\"Are there no men present? Do you promise the figure of Sir Chartres Biron is not concealed? We are all women, you assure me? Then I may tell you ...\\" Woolf scholar and feminist critic Jane Marcus believes Woolf was giving Radclyffe Hall and other writers a demonstration of how to discuss lesbianism discreetly enough to avoid obscenity trials; \\"Woolf was offering her besieged fellow writer a lesson in how to give a lesbian talk and write a lesbian work and get away with it.\\"Marcus, Jane (1996). Virginia Woolf, Cambridge and A Room of One's Own: 'The Proper Upkeep of Names. London: Cecil Woolf Publishers, p. 33. Marcus describes the atmosphere of Woolf's arrival and presence at the women's college with her lover Vita Sackville-West as \\"sapphic\\". Woolf is comfortable discussing lesbianism in her talks with the women students because she feels a women's college is a safe and essential place for such discussions. ==Criticism== Alice Walker responded to Woolf's observation that only women with 'a room of their own' are in a position to write. Woolf herself was making the point that not all women in her society had such a safe space, but Walker continues the conversation by discussing the further exclusions suffered by women of colour. In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose, Walker writes: Walker recognises that Wheatley is in a position far different from the narrator of Woolf's essay, in that she does not own herself, much less \\"a room of her own\\". Wheatley and other women writers exist outside of this room, outside of this space Woolf sets aside for women writers. Although she calls attention to the limits of Woolf's essay, Walker, in uniting womanist prose (women's writing) with the physical and metaphorical space of \\"our mothers' gardens\\", pays homage to Woolf's similar endeavour of seeking space, \\"room\\", for women writers. ==Adaptations and cultural references== In 1975 the Madison, Wisconsin bookstore \\"A Room of One‚Äôs Own\\" was founded by five women as a feminist bookstore, but later it became a regular bookstore. A literary journal launched in Vancouver, Canada in 1975 by the West Coast Feminist Literary Magazine Society, or the Growing Room Collective, was originally called Room of One's Own but changed to Room in 2007. The Smiths' 1985 song \\"Shakespeare's Sister\\" is named after a section of the essay. Shakespears Sister, founded in 1988, is an alternative pop group featuring Siobhan Fahey. The name was adapted from the title of the Smiths' song; however, Fahey has described the meaning of the name being, \\"Siobhan Fahey is the mother, the sister, the daughter, it's not the artist. The artist is Shakespear's sister.\\" A Room of One's Own was adapted as a play by Patrick Garland that premiered in 1989; a television adaptation of that play was broadcast on PBS Masterpiece Theatre in 1991. The Leather Archives and Museum, founded in 1991, has an exhibit called A Room of Her Own, about which curator Alex Warner has written, \\"As I began work for the first exhibit installation of the Women‚Äôs Leather History Project, I was excited that we were both literally and figuratively making room for Leatherwomen‚Äôs history in the LA&M.; It was out of this line of thinking that \\"A Room of Her Own\\" emerged, building on Virginia Woolf‚Äôs 1929 feminist text that argues for women‚Äôs need for space to think and create\\". The Two Nice Girls' third album, from 1991, was called Chloe Liked Olivia, referencing the essay.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-1991-05-23-9102150968-story.html Chloe plus Olivia: an anthology of lesbian literature from the seventeenth century to the present was published in 1994 by Lillian Faderman; the phrase \\"Chloe plus Olivia\\" is a reference to the essay. A blog eventually called Shakesville started in 2004 as Shakespeare‚Äôs Sister; the blog ended in 2019. It was named after the Smiths' song \\"Shakespeare's Sister\\" and the essay, because (in regard to the essay), \\"I [the blog's original author] am the heir of all the Shakespeare's Sisters before me, who carved out rooms of their own, tiny pieces of space and time, in which they formed the habit of freedom and mustered the courage to write exactly what they thought. I took up their legacy with breathless gratitude and compelling need, and I created a room of my own, built of 1s and 0s, where I try to honor them, as best I can\\". Patricia Lamkin's play Balancing the Moon (2011) was inspired by the essay. A women's co-working space in Singapore, \\"Woolf Works\\", opened in 2014 and was named after Virginia Woolf in tribute to the essay. ==See also== * Le Monde 100 Books of the Century (it is number 69) ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * (1991, with Eileen Atkins). * Longworth, Deborah (1 March 2017). \\"Virginia Woolf and Feminist Aesthetics\\", lecture on A Room of One's Own, University of Birmingham.

It is used in the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is used by inhaling the medication into the lungs. Common side effects include thrush, headache, and cough. Serious side effects may include worsening asthma, anaphylaxis, seizures, and heart problems. Safety in pregnancy and breastfeeding is unclear. Fluticasone, a corticosteroid, works by decreasing inflammation while salmeterol, a long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA), works by activating beta-2 adrenergic receptors. The combination was approved for medical use in the United States in 2000. A generic version was approved in the United States in 2019. In 2017, it was the 65th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than twelve million prescriptions. ==Medical uses== Fluticasone, a corticosteroid, is the anti-inflammatory component of the combination which decreases inflammation in the lungs. This leads to improvement in breathing. Salmeterol, a LABA, treats constriction of the airways. The combination of both is meant to be used as maintenance therapy and not as a rescue therapy for sudden symptoms. ==Side effects== The common side effects of this combination are those of its individual drugs. For instance, the use of inhaled corticosteroids is associated with oral candidiasis, commonly known as yeast infection or thrush. Rinsing the mouth with water after inhaling the medication decreases the risk of developing this condition. While the use of inhaled steroids and LABA are recommended for the resulting improvement in control of symptoms of asthma, concerns have been raised that salmeterol may increase the risk of death due to asthma, and this additional risk is not reduced by the addition of inhaled steroids. Other side effects from this drug combination may include increased blood pressure, change in heart rate, an irregular heartbeat, increased risk of osteoporosis, cataracts, and glaucoma. Studies have demonstrated the safety of inhaled fluticasone propionate in children. A systematic review published in 2013 found no significant adverse effect on the function of the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis, growth, and bone mineral density in asthmatic children when inhaled fluticasone is used for up to three months. ==Mechanism of action== Fluticasone/salmeterol contains fluticasone propionate, a synthetic corticosteroid, and salmeterol, a selective long-acting beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. Fluticasone works as a potent anti-inflammatory agent, inhibiting multiple cell types such as mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils all of which contribute to inflammation, a large component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Salmeterol works by stimulating intracellular adenyl cyclase which acts as a catalyst in the production of cyclic AMP. Increased cyclic AMP levels lead to a relaxation of bronchial smooth muscles. Additionally, cyclic AMP inhibits the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity. ==Society and culture== ===Generic equivalents=== On January 30, 2019, the FDA granted Mylan N.V. the first generic approval for Advair Diskus. ===Civil settlements=== In 2012, Advair was part of a larger civil settlement agreement between GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the United States, in which GSK agreed to pay $1.043 billion; the United States said that GSK promoted off-label uses of Advair and paid kickbacks to healthcare professionals to sell this drug, among others. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Antiasthmatic drugs Category:Combination drugs Category:GlaxoSmithKline brands Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Fluticasone/salmeterol"},{"id":"846113","text":"There are three rivers named the Fitzroy River, all in Australia: *Fitzroy River (Queensland) *Fitzroy River (Victoria) *Fitzroy River (Western Australia) == See also == * Fitzroy River Barrage (disambiguation) ","title":"Fitzroy River"},{"id":"846119","text":"Carl Ernst Albrecht Hartwig Carl Ernst Albrecht Hartwig (14 January 1851 in Frankfurt ‚Äì 3 May 1923 in Bamberg) was a German astronomer.

It is within the local government area of Shire of Livingstone (between 2008 and 2013, it was within the Rockhampton Region). Home of the famous Singing Ship Monument, the Emu Park land area was first discovered by Captain James Cook in 1770. It overlooks the islands of Keppel Bay, including Great Keppel Island. Emu Park is a popular tourist spot, and has won several tourism awards, and features fishing, surfing, boating, and unspoiled beaches. ==History== Fisherman's Beach at Emu Park, Queensland, circa 1940 Prime Minister Stanley Bruce and Mrs Bruce at Emu Park, 1926 Passengers at the Emu Park Railway Station Emu Park's European history dates to the 1860s when the Jardine family established a cattle grazing property south of the current town, at Zilzie, an anagram of Lizzie Jardine. Emu Park township was established in the 1870s when several Rockhampton families built seaside holiday houses on the hills overlooking the two beaches that are a feature of the town ‚Äì Fisherman's Beach and Pine Beach. Emu Park was connected to Rockhampton by train in 1888 and became a popular, but fairly select, seaside resort from that time on. A branch to Yeppoon, further to the north was opened in 1910. Hewittville Post Office opened on 12 November 1883 (a receiving office had been open from 1876) and was renamed Emu Park in 1890. By the 1920s the town boasted two large hotels, a cinema, court house, state primary school, public library, shops and many guest houses for visitors. A small pier was opened by Mrs Bruce, wife of the Prime Minister, Stanley Bruce, in 1926 and Bell Park, a shady park on the shores of Fisherman's Beach was established in the 1930s. The railway link from Rockhampton closed in the 1960s due to declining passenger numbers and the line to Yeppoon no longer exists. Remnants of the Woppaburra people evicted from their homeland in the Greater and South Keppel islands lived on in both Emu Park and Yeppoon. The Emu Park Library opened in 1984. At the 2011 census, Emu Park had a population of 2,021. ==Heritage listings== Emu Park has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Hill Street: Bell Park ==Events== Emu Park hosts a variety of annual community events including the Festival of the Wind kite festival, the Classics By The Coast vintage car show and Emu Park Lions Club Oktoberfest (now running over 30 years) celebrations. The town's popular market days are held on the third Sunday of each month in Bell Park. ==Sport== A variety of local sporting organisations can be found within Emu Park, incorporating sports such as rugby league, rugby union, touch football, lawn bowls, croquet, swimming, surf lifesaving, fishing and golf. Livingstone Shire Council has built a new multi-sports facility on Hartley St, with future plans to expand facilities. In 2014, it was announced that Emu Park would be permitted to enter team into Rockhampton Senior Rugby League's A-grade, reserve and Under 20's competitions for the 2015 season. Home games will be played at the Emu Park Sports Facility on Hartley St in Emu Park. ==Education== Emu Park State School is located on Fountain Street, Emu Park.

A plant-based diet is not necessarily vegetarian. The use of the phrase \\"plant-based\\" has changed over time and examples can be found of the phrase \\"plant-based diet\\" being used to refer to vegan diets, which contain no food from animal sources, and vegetarian diets, which may include dairy or eggs but no meat, as well as diets with varying amounts of animal-based foods, such as semi-vegetarian diets. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics states that well-planned plant- based diets support health and are appropriate throughout all life stages, including pregnancy, lactation, childhood, and adulthood, as well as for athletes. As of the early 21st century, it was estimated that 4 billion people live primarily on a plant-based diet, some because of limits caused by shortages of crops, fresh water, and energy resources. In Europe, consumption of plant-based meat substitutes made up 40% of the world market in 2019 and is forecast to grow by 60% through 2025, due mainly to concerns for health, food security, and animal welfare. In the U.S. during 2019, the retail market for plant-based foods grew eight times faster than the general retail food market. ==Terminology== Vegan author Ellen Jaffe Jones wrote about the origins of the term in a 2011 interview: > \\"I taught cooking classes for the national non-profit, Physicians Committee > for Responsible Medicine, and during that time, the phrase 'plant-based > diet' came to be used as a euphemism for vegan eating, or \\"the 'v' word. It > was developed to take the emphasis off the word 'vegan', because some > associated it with being too extreme a position, sometimes based exclusively > in animal rights versus a health rationale.\\" Some sources use the phrase \\"plant-based diet\\" to refer to diets including varying degrees of animal products, for example defining \\"plant-based diets\\" as diets that \\"include generous amounts of plant foods and limited amounts of animal foods\\" and stating that \\"The American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund call for choosing predominantly plant-based diets rich in a variety of vegetables and fruits, legumes, and minimally processed starchy staple foods and limiting red meat consumption, if red meat is eaten at all\\".See American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada, \\"Position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada: Vegetarian diets\\" (February 16, 2014): \\" ... plant-based diets, defined as diets that include generous amounts of plant foods and limited amounts of animal foods\\", and listing the views of other groups. Others draw a distinction between \\"plant-based\\" and \\"plant-only\\". In various sources, \\"plant-based diet\\" has been used to refer to: * Veganism: diet of vegetables, legumes, fruit, grains, nuts, and seeds, but no food from animal sources. * Vegetarianism: diet of vegetables, legumes, fruit, nuts, and grains, that may include eggs and dairy, but no meat. ** Ovo-lacto vegetarianism: includes dairy and eggs. **Ovo vegetarianism: includes eggs but no dairy. **Lacto vegetarianism: includes dairy but no eggs. * Semi-vegetarianism: mostly vegetarian diet with occasional inclusion of meat or poultry. **Macrobiotic diet: semi-vegetarian diet that highlights whole grains, vegetables, beans, miso soup, sea vegetables, and traditionally or naturally processed foods, with or without seafood and other animal products. ** Pescatarian: semi- vegetarian diet using seafood as the only meat. **Flexitarian: semi-vegetarian diet that includes limiting meat intake daily or being vegetarian only on certain days of the week. ==History== === Prehistoric life === Although herbivory (a diet entirely of plants) was long thought to be a Mesozoic phenomenon, evidence of it is found as soon as the fossils which could show it. Within less than 20 million years after the first land plants evolved, plants were being consumed by arthropods. Herbivory among four-limbed terrestrial vertebrates, the tetrapods developed in the Late Carboniferous (307 - 299 million years ago). Early tetrapods were large amphibious piscivores. While amphibians continued to feed on fish and insects, some reptiles began exploring two new food types: the tetrapods (carnivory) and plants (herbivory). Carnivory was a natural transition from insectivory for medium and large tetrapods, requiring minimal adaptation. In contrast, a complex set of adaptations was necessary for feeding on highly fibrous plant materials. === Modern herbivores and mild omnivory === Quite often, mainly herbivorous creatures will eat small quantities of animal-based food when it becomes available. Although this is trivial most of the time, omnivorous or herbivorous birds, such as sparrows, often will feed their chicks insects while food is most needed for growth. Capinera, John (2010). Insects and Wildlife. Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell. . On close inspection it appears that nectar-feeding birds such as sunbirds rely on the ants and other insects that they find in flowers, not for a richer supply of protein, but for essential nutrients such as Vitamin B12 that are absent from nectar. Similarly, monkeys of many species eat maggoty fruit, sometimes in clear preference to sound fruit.Ewing, Jack (2005). Monkeys Are Made of Chocolate. Publisher: Pixyjack Press. . When to refer to such animals as omnivorous or otherwise, is a question of context and emphasis, rather than of definition. ===Humans=== Humans are omnivorous, capable of consuming diverse plant and animal foods. Fossil evidence from wear patterns on teeth indicates the possibility that early hominids like robust australopithecines and Homo habilis were opportunistic omnivores, generally subsisting on a plant-based diet, but supplementing with meat when possible.Timothy Clack, Ancestral Roots: Modern Living and Human Evolution (2008), p. 324.Robert Foley, \\"The Evolutionary Consequences of Increased Carnivory in Hominids\\", in Meat-Eating and Human Evolution (2001), p. 321. == Sustainability == The Food and Agriculture Organization defined a sustainable diet as one with \\"low environmental impacts which contribute to food and nutrition security, and to healthy life for present and future generations\\" and one that is affordable for all while optimizing both natural and human resources. A sustainable diet can be measured by its level of nutritional adequacy, environmental sustainability, cultural acceptability and affordability. Environmental sustainability can be measured by indicators of efficiency and environmental protection. Efficiency measures the ratio of inputs and outputs required to produce a given level of foods. Input energy refers to processing, transporting, storing and serving food, compared with the output of physical human energy. Conversely, environmental protection refers to the level of preservation of ecological systems. Plant-based diets may contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land, water, and fertilizers used for agriculture. As a significant percentage of crops around the world are used to feed livestock rather than humans, evidence shows that increasing the practice of a plant- based diet may contribute toward minimizing climate change and biodiversity loss. While soy cultivation is a \\"major driver of deforestation in the Amazon basin\\", the vast majority of soy crops are used for livestock consumption rather than human consumption. ==Health research== Plant-based diets are under preliminary research to assess whether they may improve metabolic measures in health and disease, and if there are long-term effects on diabetes. When clinical studies were focused on types of plant-based foods (such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts) an improvement of diabetes biomarkers, most notably a reduced incidence of obesity, was observed. Plant- based diets were also associated with improved emotional and physical well- being, relief of depression, higher quality of life, and better general health in diabetic people. Cognitive and mental effects of a plant-based diet are inconclusive. ==Commerce of plant-based foods== In 2019, Europeans consumed 40% of the world total of plant-based meat alternatives out of concern for health, food security, and animal welfare. During 2019, the total retail market for plant-based foods in the U.S. was $4.5 billion, growing at 31% over the previous two years, compared to 4% for the entire retail food market. Growth of plant-based food consumption in the U.S. occurred among flexitarian consumers seeking alternative protein sources to meat, fortification with micronutrients, whole grains, and dietary fiber ingredients, meat flavor and comfort food innovations, and \\"clean\\" food product labels. In 2019, the European Union launched a program called \\"Smart Protein\\" to reuse large-scale, plant-based residues such as pasta, bread, and yeast byproducts together with whole grains, as new high protein, flavorful substitutes for meat, seafood, and dairy products. == See also == * List of diets ==References== Category:Diets Category:Edible plants ","title":"Plant-based diet"},{"id":"846153","text":"Hashem Aghajari, 2019 Hashem Aghajari () also Seyyed Hashem Aghajari (born 1957) is an Iranian historian, university professor and a critic of the Islamic Republic's government who was sentenced to death in 2002 for apostasy for a speech he gave on Islam urging Iranians to \\"not blindly follow\\" Islamic clerics.\\"Iranian Court Again Spares Professor's Life\\" BURTON BOLLAG.

Various activities are associated with pressure changes. Underwater diving is the most frequently cited example, but pressure changes also affect people who work in other pressurized environments (for example, caisson workers), and people who move between different altitudes. == Ambient pressure == Ambient pressure is the pressure in the water around the diver (or the air, with caisson workers etc.). As a diver descends, the ambient pressure increases. At in salt water, it is twice the normal pressure than that at the surface. At 40 meters (a common recommended limit for recreational diving) it is 5 times the pressure than at sea level. Pressure decreases as we rise above sea level, but less dramatically. At 3000 feet altitude (almost 1000 meters), the ambient pressure is almost 90% of sea level pressure. Ambient pressure does not drop to 50% of sea level pressure until 20,000 feet or 6,000 meters altitude. == Effects of pressure on the body == === Direct effects on tissues === This is not of practical importance, because the body is mostly composed of barely compressible materials such as water. People often wonder whether scuba divers feel their body being crushed by the pressure, but divers would have to reach depths of thousands of feet before their flesh began to suffer significant compression. === Gas filled spaces === Gas is very compressible. Humans have many air spaces: sinuses, middle ears, gas in our bowels, cavities in our teeth, and largest of all, our lungs. On land in our daily lives, the pressure in our air spaces is usually exactly the same as the pressure outside, because our air spaces are connected to the outside world. If there was a pressure difference between the outside world and one of our air spaces, then we experience painful pressure on the walls of that air space, as air pushes from the higher-pressure side to the lower-pressure side. This is why we sometimes get painful ears on air trips. === Dissolved gas === A percentage of the gas we breathe (air) is always dissolved in our blood, like the gas dissolved in a carbonated drink bottle with the lid on. If a person moves to a higher ambient pressure, then the gas inhaled is at a higher pressure, so more of it dissolves in the blood and diffuses into body tissues (Henry's and Fick's gas laws). If they slowly move back to a lower pressure, then the extra gas comes out slowly until they are back to their normal amount of dissolved gas. But if they move quickly to a lower ambient pressure, then the gas comes out of our blood and tissues violently, in large bubbles, in the same way that quickly removing the cap from a bottle of soft drink produces far more bubbles than slowly opening the bottle. == Types of dysbarism == Different types of illness result from increases in pressure (for example, descent during an underwater dive, descent during a plane flight), versus decreases in pressure (for example, coming up from a caisson, or ascending a mountain). Dysbarism comprises several types of illness: === Decompression sickness (DCS) === Decompression sickness, also called caisson workers' disease and the bends, is the most well-known complication of scuba diving. It occurs as divers ascend, and often from ascending too fast or without doing decompression stops. Bubbles are large enough and numerous enough to cause physical injury. It is quite possible that all divers have microbubbles in their blood to some extent, but that most of the time these bubbles are so few and so small that they cause no harm. When DCS occurs, bubbles disrupt tissues in the joints, brain, spinal cord, lungs, and other organs. Symptoms vary enormously. DCS may be as subtle as unusual tiredness after a dive, or an aching elbow, or a mottled skin rash. Or, it may present dramatically, with unconsciousness, seizures, paralysis, shortness of breath, or death. Paraplegia is not uncommon. === Nitrogen narcosis === Nitrogen narcosis is also called ‚ÄúL‚Äôivresse des grandes profondeurs‚Äù or \\"rapture of the deep\\". Nitrogen comprises 79% of the air, but at surface pressures it has no sedating effect. At greater depths, however, nitrogen affects the brain in the same way as nitrous oxide (also known as laughing gas) and other anaesthetic gases. The effect is similar to the effects of alcohol, and to some extent there is cross-tolerance. Unlike alcohol, the onset and disappearance are near instantaneous. A diver may be quite clear-headed at 20 meters, and yet giddy and silly at 30 meters. Ascending to 20 meters will almost instantly clear the head. === High pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS) === === Barotrauma === Barotrauma is injury caused by pressure effects on gas spaces. This may occur during ascent or descent. The ears are the most commonly affected body part. The most serious injury is lung barotrauma, which can result in pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, subcutaneous emphysema, and arterial gas embolism. All divers, commercial air travelers, people traveling overland between different altitudes, and people who work in pressurized environments have had to deal with some degree of barotrauma effect upon their ears, sinuses, and other air spaces. At the most extreme, barotrauma can cause ruptured eardrums, bleeding sinuses, exploding tooth cavities, and the lung injuries described above. This is the reason why divers follow a procedure of not holding their breath during ascent. By breathing continuously, they keep the airways open and avoid pressure differences between their lungs and ambient pressure. ==== Arterial gas embolism (AGE) ==== Arterial gas embolism (AGE) is a complication of lung barotrauma of ascent. It occurs when breathing gas is introduced to the circulation on the arterial side via lung over- pressure trauma. AGE can present in similar ways to arterial blockages seen in other medical situations. Affected people may suffer strokes, with paralysis or numbness down one side; they may suffer heart attacks; they may suffer pulmonary embolism with shortness of breath and chest pain. It is often impossible to distinguish AGE from DCS, but luckily it is rarely necessary for physicians to be able to distinguish between the two, as treatment is the same. Sometimes AGE and DCS are lumped into a single entity, Decompression Illness (DCI). === Classification === In addition to the foregoing, dysbarism is sometimes classified according to the source of the excess gas, with \\"trapped gas\\" dysbarism referring to the expansion of pockets that were already in a gaseous state in the body, and \\"evolved gas\\" dysbarism referring to gasses (primarily nitrogen or helium) dissolved in the body coming out of solution to form gas bubbles. ==See also== * * ==References== == External links == Category:Underwater diving safety Category:Diving medicine ","title":"Dysbarism"}]`),I={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function H(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const D=d(I,[["render",H]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/13.md","filePath":"guide/13.md"}'),F={name:"guide/13.md"},N=Object.assign(F,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{W as __pageData,N as default};
