He became Emir of Mosul in 1170 after the death of his father Qutb ad-Din Mawdud. Saif had been chosen as the successor under the advice of eunuch ‚ÄôAbd al-Masish, who wanted to keep the effective rule in lieu of the young emir; the disinherited son of Mawdud, Imad ad-Din Zengi II, fled to Aleppo at the court of Nur ad-Din. The latter, who was waiting for an excuse to annex Mosul, conquered Sinjar in September 1170 and besieged Mosul, which surrendered on 22 January 1171. After ousting al-Masish, he put G√ºm√ºshtekin, one of his officers, as governor, leaving Saif ud-Din nothing but the nominal title of emir. The latter also married the daughter of Nur ad-Din. At Nur ad-Din's death (May 1174), G√ºm√ºshtekin went to Damascus to take control of his son and entitled himself of atabeg of Aleppo. Saif ud-Din rejected his tutorage and restored his independence. The nobles of Damascus, worried by G√ºm√ºshtekin's increasing power, offered Saif ud-Din their city, but he could not intervene since he was busy in retaking Mosul. Thenceforth Damascus was given to Saladin. Saladin took control of Biladu-Sham (Syria) but Saif ud-Din wanted to take over Aleppo, so he sent his brother Izz ad-Din Mas'ud at the head of an army to fight Saladin: they met in an area near Hama called Kron Hama (Arabic: ŸÇÿ±ŸàŸÜ ÿ≠ŸÖÿßŸá) where Saif ud-Din was defeated. Later he prepared for another battle at Tell al-Sultan (Arabic: ÿ™ŸÑ ÿ≥ŸÑÿ∑ÿßŸÜ) near Aleppo, where he was also defeated; he went back to Mosul and sent messengers to Saladin offering his alliance, which was accepted.

Boniecki's mother chose to follow with her children. The circumstances following the Russian Revolution produced an opportunity for Boniecki, his mother and his siblings to slip away. With much difficulty they found a way to Poland, arriving in 1921. Boniecki studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, and graduated in 1929.

Sto Jedena≈õcie Dni Letargu (Wspomnienia z Pawiaka), p.153. Cracow: Wydawnictwo Literackie. Thence he was sent to Majdanek concentration camp. Despite being a subject of Nazi experiments and appalling conditions at the camp, Boniecki continued fashioning sculptures out of whatever he could find to encourage hope and endurance in his fellow prisoners, and in memory of those murdered. His heavily symbolic sculptures included:Boniecki, Maria Albin (1961-07-13). \\"Rze≈∫by Jedyne w Historii\\" (Sculptures Unique in History). Polish Daily News, p.6. * The Frog (fountain) * The Tortoise * The Three Eagles Mausoleum (also known as the Column of Three Eagles) * The Seal with Fish * The Lizard * The Shrine When presented with an opportunity, Boniecki proposed a sculpture of three eagles to the camp officials, who accepted the offer, believing the eagles were a German symbol. But the Three Eagles Mausoleum that he produced symbolized, among other things, the freedom of Poland, brotherhood, and triumph. Some human ashes of the victims of the gas chambers were secretly placed within the sculpture. The Three Eagles Mausoleum was destroyed after the war and a reconstruction was created in 1962 by Stanis≈Çaw Strzy≈ºy≈Ñski, by order of the Polish government and against Boniecki's wishes. This reconstruction (see External links) remains on display at the Majdanek Museum. At the same time, Boniecki was the chief of section V of Wachlarz, and gathered information within the camp for delegates of the Polish government- in-exile.Marsza≈Çek, J√≥zef (1987). Majdanek: ob√≥z koncentracyjny w Lublinie. p.156. Warszawa: Interpress. . Information was smuggled in and out of the camp routinely. With the help of the Polish Home Army, Boniecki escaped in 1944 and, rather than fleeing the country, resumed his counterintelligence activities. He took part in the Warsaw Uprising and was again captured by the Nazis. He passed through the German prisoner-of-war camps at Lamsdorf, Gross Born, and finally Sandbostel, where he was liberated by British forces. ===Post-war=== Boniecki settled in Paris where he met his wife Krystyna Boniecki (n√©e Binental), also an artist.

He also operated steamboats on the Kootenay River in Montana and on the Stikine River in western British Columbia. Steam navigation in the Rocky Mountain Trench which runs through the East Kootenay region was closely linked to Armstrong's personality and career. In addition to being a steamboat captain, Armstrong was also a prospector, white-water boat pilot and guide in the Big Bend country of the Columbia River. ==Early life== Armstrong had been born in Sorel, Quebec about 1859. He moved to Winnipeg in 1881, and then came west working with a Canadian Pacific Railway surveying crew in the Columbia Valley from Cranbrook to Golden. ==Character== Lewis R. Freeman, a journalist, adventurer, movie-maker, and football coach, came to know Armstrong well in 1920 during a boat trip down the Columbia. Freeman described Armstrong, and as \\"one of the most picturesque personalities in the pioneering history of British Columbia\\":Freeman, at 20-21 ==Beginning of steam navigation== Duchess, steamboat, near Golden, BC 1887. A member of the First Nations. possibly serving as a crewman, is also shown near the steamer. Duchess, 1887 In 1882 Armstrong homesteaded on the east side of Columbia Lake and planted potatoes, with the plan of selling them to the workers building the CPR downriver at Golden. He built two flat-bottomed boats, (called \\"bateaux\\") to transport his crop on the river. Armstrong decided a steamboat would be a good way to tow the bateaux back upstream. He arranged to have steam engines shipped west from a steam ferry built in 1840 that operated at his home town in Quebec. Once the engines arrived, and a boiler could be located, Armstrong assembled a steamboat from miscellaneous planks and timbers that were lying around at an old sawmill. The result was the Duchess, launched in 1886 at Golden. Two early passengers wrote that her appearance was \\"somewhat decrepit\\" and Armstrong himself later agreed that she was \\"a pretty crude steamboat.\\"\\"Francis Patrick Armstrong\\", Basin Record (Newsletter of the Columbia Basin Institute of Regional History), Vol 2, No.1, at page 3 (accessed 11-26-2008) ==Building the second Duchess== Duchess at Golden, BC, ca 1888 Duchess sank at least once, but Armstrong was eventually able to raise her from the river. He then applied the odd-shaped steamer to make enough money in 1887 to have a new sternwheeler built, also called Duchess. Armstrong hired the veteran shipbuilder Alexander Watson, of Victoria, BC to build the new steamer, which although small, was well-designed and looked like a steamboat. Armstrong also had built a second steamer, Marion, which although smaller than the second Duchess, needed only six inches of water to run in. This was an advantage in the often shallow waters of the Columbia above Golden, where as Armstrong put it, \\"the river's bottom was often very close to the river's top\\".Downs, at 101 ==The Baillie-Grohman Canal== Completed lock at the Baillie-Grohman Canal, ca 1889. Armstrong deliberately destroyed these lock gates in making the transit of North Star through the canal in 1902. A curious feature of the Rocky Mountain Trench is that two of the major rivers that flow through it, the Columbia, flowing north, and the Kootenay flowing south, are separated by only about a mile of low marshy prairie at a place now known as Canal Flats. As the name implies, a shipping canal was built across Canal Flats by William Adolf Baillie-Grohman, a European adventurer and promoter from wealthy and privileged background. The canal was completed in 1889, but it was only used three times by steamboats, every time under the command of Captain Armstrong.Timmen, Fritz, Blow for the Landing -- A Hundred Years of Steam Navigation on the Waters of the West, at 87-88, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, ID 1973 In 1893, Armstrong built Gwendoline at Hansen's Landing on the Kootenay River, and took the vessel through the canal north to the shipyard at Golden to complete her fitting out. By this time it appears that the canal had been damaged or deteriorated to the boat where at least some of the transit of Gwendoline had to be accomplished by pulling the vessel of the water, partially dismantling the boat, and pulling her along on rollers.Other sources state that the entire northbound transit was made on rollers, and Gwendoline was not partially dismantled, but rather had never been fully completed at Hansen's Landing. See Moore, D.M., Riverboating on the Kootenay. Over the winter, Armstrong, it is reported, was able to prevail on the provincial government to expend funds to repair the canal. In late May 1894 Armstrong returned the completed Gwendoline back to the Kootenay River, this time transiting normally the rehabilitated canal.Virtual Crowsnest Highway (regional history website), \\"Time Line for Southwestern Canada\\"Another source states that the southbound transit was possible only because of a luckily high level of water in the canal, and mention nothing about repair. Moore, D.M., Riverboating on the Kootenay The canal remained unused until 1902, when Armstrong brought North Star north from the Kootenay to the Columbia. The transit of North Star was only made possible by the destruction, by dynamite, of the lock at the canal. ==Mining boom on the upper Kootenay River== A mining boom along the upper Kootenay river in the early 1890s led to a demand for shipping to transport miners and supplies into, and ore out of, the region surrounding the river. The Great Northern Railway at Jennings, Montana was the nearest downriver railhead for upper Kootenay shipping. Armstrong moved south from the Columbia to the Kootenay, and built the small sternwheeler Gwendoline at Hansen's Landing, about north of the present community of Wasa. Instead of taking the ore south to the Jennings, Armstrong's plan was to move the ore north across Canal Flats and then down the Columbia to the CPR railhead at Golden. Armstrong took Gwendoline through the Baillie-Grohman Canal in the fall of 1893 (or rolled her across Canal Flats), fitted her out at Golden, and returned through the canal in the spring of 1894. The difficulty of moving Gwendoline through the Canal convinced Armstrong that the only feasible route was south to Jennings. By early 1896, Armstrong joined with veteran Willamette River steamboat captain James D. Miller and built Ruth (named after Armstrong's daughter) at Libby, Montana. Ruth was the largest steamer yet to operate on the upper Kootenay River. Later, Armstrong and Miller associated with Wardner, and, when their competitors, DePuy and Jones suffered the misfortune of having their new vessel Rustler (125 tons) sunk after just six weeks of operation, the three men were able to dominate the river traffic. == Jennings Canyon== North Star ca 1902. This was the largest vessel ever to operate on the Columbia River above Golden, BC Once in the United States, the Kootenay river, in its natural state before the construction of the Libby Dam, flowed through Jennings Canyon to the settlement of Jennings, Montana. Jennings has almost completely disappeared as a town, but it was near Libby, Montana. Above Jennings, the Kootenay River narrowed as it ran through Jennings Canyon, which was a significant hazard to any river navigation.The canyon can no longer be seen, as it is under the waters of Lake Koocanusa (formed by the Libby Dam). A particularly dangerous stretch was known as the Elbow. Jennings Canyon was described by Professor Lyman as \\"a strip of water, foaming-white, downhill almost as on a steep roof, hardly wider than steamboat\\".Lyman, at 280. No insurance agent would write a policy for steamboats and cargo transiting the Jennings Canyon. Armstrong once persuaded an agent from San Francisco to consider making a quote on premiums. The agent decided to examine the route for himself, and went on board with Armstrong as the captain's boat shot through the canyon. At the end of the trip, the agent's quote for a policy was one-quarter of the value of the cargo. Faced with this quote, Armstrong decided to forgo insurance. The huge profits to be made seemed to justify the risk. Combined the two steamers could earn $2,000 in gross receipts per day, a lot of money in 1897. By comparison, the sternwheeler J.D. Farrell (1897), cost $20,000 to build in 1897. In ten days of operation then, an entire steamboat could be paid for. Armstrong and Miller unsuccessfully tried to get the U.S. Government to finance clearing of some of the rocks and obstructions in Jennings Canyon. Without government help, they hired crews themselves to do the work over two winters, but the results were not of much value. Despite the work on the channel, every steamboat Armstrong ever took through Jennings Canyon was eventually wrecked in the canyon. The wreck Gwendoline and Ruth on May 7, 1897, resulted in the destruction of Ruth and the sinking of Gwendoline, fortunately with no losses other than severe financial ones. When the new steamer North Star was launched a few weeks later, Armstrong was able to make up for some of the losses with 21 completed round trips on the Kootenay between Fort Steele and Jennings before low water forced him to tie up on September 3, 1897.William Denison Lyman, The Columbia River -- Its History, Its Myths, Its Scenery, Its Commerce, at 277-81, 293, Putnam, New York NY 1911 1909 edition on-line here ==Move to the Stikine River== Mono with damaged paddlewheel, possibly at Wrangel, Alaska. Frank P. Armstrong and A.F. Henderson built this vessel, which was initially intended for service on the Stikine River In January 1898, Armstrong went north to Alaska to participate in the Klondike Gold Rush, with Armstrong deciding to try his chances at making money as a steamboat captain on the Stikine River then being promoted as the \\"All-Canadian\\" route to the Yukon River gold fields. On the Stikine River, Armstrong served with the famous steamboat captain John Irving. Together with A.F. Henderson, Armstrong built a steamboat, Mono for the Teslin Transportation Company of Victoria, BC. As might be expected from a vessel designed by Armstrong, Mono had excellent shallow water performance.Affleck, Edwin L., A Century of Paddlewheelers in the Pacific Northwest, the Yukon and Alaska, at page 56, Alexander Nicholls Press, Vancouver, BC 2000 When the Stikine river route collapsed as an alternate access to the Klondike in July 1898, Mono was taken under tow to St. Michael, Alaska for service on the Yukon River.Mono was damaged en route, and the towing vessel was forced to return with Mono to Wrangell, Alaska (at the mouth of the Stikine River). In 1901, Mono was salvaged and taken to the Yukon, but was destroyed in a fire at Dawson, YT, in March, 1902For a detailed discussion of the Stikine River route and the role that CPR steamboats played in it in early 1898, see Turner, Robert D., Sternwheelers and Steam Tugs -- An Illustrated History of the Canadian Pacific Railway's British Columbia Lake and River Service, Sono Nis Press, Victoria BC 1984 . Unfortunately this reference does not go beyond the CPR steamers and does not discuss the other vessels or captains, like Armstrong, who did not work for CPR.Hacking, Norman R., and Lamb, W. Kaye, The Princess Story -- A Century and a Half of West Coast Shipping, at page 178, Mitchell Press, Vancouver BC 1974 (no ISBN number) ==Return to the Columbia River== North Star was sold back to Captain Armstrong when he returned from his Klondike adventure, and on June 4, 1902, he took her north to the Columbia River on his famous dynamite-aided transit of the decrepit Baillie-Grohman canal. With North Star gone, steamboating on the upper Kootenay ended for good. While Armstrong had been engaged in the Kootenay and the Klondike mining booms, a few competitors had appeared on the upper Columbia. In 1899, Harold E. Forster (d.1940)Forster Creek, which flows into the Columbia River near Radium Hot Springs, BC, is named after H.E. Forster. a wealthy mountain climber, businessman, politician and occasional steamboat captain, brought Selkirk by rail from Shuswap Lake to Golden, where he launched her but used her as a yacht and not, at least initially, as commercial vessel. Also, Captain Alexander Blakely bought the little sidewheeler Pert and operated her on the river. In 1902 Armstrong dismantled Duchess. Armstrong built a new steamer, Ptarmigan, using the engines from Duchess which were by then were over 60 years old. ==Service in the Great War== Many men from British Columbia served in World War I which began in 1914. Steamboat men were no exception, even Armstrong although he could easily have stayed home because of his age. Instead, Armstrong supervised British river transport in the Middle East, on the Nile and Tigris rivers. The Tigris in particular was in a difficult and hard-fought theater of war. Armstrong was not the only one of the small community of steamboat men of Golden to serve. Armstrong's apprentice, John Blakely (1889‚Äì1963), the son of his former competitor, enlisted and went to Europe, where he became one of only six survivors when his ship was torpedoed in the English Channel.Downs, Art, Paddlewheels on the Frontier -- The Story of British Columbia and Yukon Sternwheel Steamers, at pages 100-112, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1972 ==End of steam navigation on the upper Columbia river== Abandoned sternwheelers at boatyard at Golden, BC. Larger steamer is probably Selkirk, with apparently a smaller vessel (unidentified) behind), ca 1920 The construction of railroads and the economic dislocations caused by the war had doomed steamboats as a method of transportation on the upper Columbia. With Armstrong in command, Nowitka made the last steamboat run on the upper Columbia in May 1920, pushing a barge-mounted pile-driver to build a bridge at Brisco, which when complete was too low to allow a steamboat to pass under it. ==Last years and legacy== Armstrong found employment with the Dominion government on his return from the war. He was seriously injured in an accident in Nelson, BC and died in an hospital in Vancouver, BC in January 1923. His own life had spanned the entire history of steam navigation in the Rocky Mountain Trench from 1886 to 1920. An older riverman who had known Captain Armstrong said of him: \\"With Armstrong those who could pay were expected and those who couldn't were never left behind\\".Downs at 112-113 ==See also== * Baillie-Grohman Canal * North Star (sternwheeler 1897) * Steamboats of the upper Columbia and Kootenay Rivers ==Notes== Category:1859 births Category:1923 deaths Category:Canadian sailors Category:Steamship captains Category:People of the Klondike Gold Rush ","title":"Frank P.

He was convicted of murdering three of them, and not brought to trial on the fourth. He was executed by the state of Georgia in the electric chair. ==Investigation== In 1978, Columbus, Georgia was undergoing a wave of murders of women. Several elderly white women had been killed by a perpetrator nicknamed the Stocking Strangler. In addition, the bodies of two young black sex workers had been found outside of Fort Benning nearby. The disparate groups of victims were linked by a letter to the local police chief written on United States Army stationery. The handwritten note purported to be from a gang of seven white men who were holding a black woman hostage and would kill her if the Stocking Strangler were not apprehended. The Stocking Strangler was believed to be a black man, and this had been widely reported at the time. The seven white vigilantes wished to be known as the \\"Forces of Evil\\", and wanted the police chief to communicate with them via messages on radio or television. The first letter was followed by others; eventually, a ransom demand of $10,000 was also made to keep the alleged hostage, Gail Jackson, alive. (Jackson was also known as Brenda Gail Faison and other aliases.) The letters were followed by phone calls. The letters and calls were a hoax intended to divert attention from the real killer. Gail Jackson, the supposed hostage, had been murdered five weeks before she was found, and before the first letter was sent. Her body was discovered in early April 1978. She was 21 years old. Soon afterward, following instructions in yet another call from the \\"Forces of Evil\\", a second black woman's body was found at a rifle range at Fort Benning. Her name was Irene Thirkield. She was 32. FBI profiler Robert K. Ressler created a profile which asserted that the killer was one man, not seven; black, not white; single, not well-educated, and probably a low-ranking military man at the fort in his late twenties. Using the profile and aware that both Jackson and Thirkield were prostitutes, Georgia Bureau of Investigation officers searched near the fort for bars which had generally black patrons. They were quickly able to identify William Hance and arrest him. He was a Specialist (E-4) attached to an artillery unit at the fort as a truck driver. Hance had begun his military career as a Marine before joining the Army.\\"Georgia Inmate Executed for Murdering Prostitute\\", Associated Press report April 4, 1994. Retrieved from Logansport Pharos-Tribune via NewspaperArchive.Com. November 30, 2008. When confronted with evidence including his handwriting, voice recordings, and shoe prints from the crime scenes, Hance confessed to killing both women and to the killing of a third woman at Fort Benning in September 1977. Karen Hickman, 24, was a white Army private known to date black soldiers and socialize in black pubs.\\"Hance, William Henry: Forces of Evil\\", Serial Killer Crime Index at Crimezzz.Net. Retrieved November 30, 2008. Hance was not charged with Hickman's murder in the civilian system, but was charged, tried, and convicted by a court martial for her death. Eventually, Hance was also identified as the killer of a young black woman at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana. Hance was not charged with this murder. However, despite his four known homicides, he was innocent of the Stocking Strangler murders, eventually attributed to another black man, Carlton Gary. ===Military courts=== * Hance was convicted in a military court, but not tried in civilian courts, for the murder of Irene Thirkield. * Hance was also tried and convicted in a court martial, but not a civilian court, for the murder of Karen Hickman. * During his court martial for the murder of Irene Thirkield, Hance received a life sentence which was reversed when jurors decided he lacked the mental capacity for premeditation. * For the deaths of both Hickman and Thirkield, Hance's final court martial sentence was life at hard labor. The convictions were set aside in 1980 and he was not retried by the military court system. ===Civilian courts=== * Hance v. State, 245 Ga. 856, 268 S.E.2d 339, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1067, 101 S.Ct. 796, 66 L.Ed.2d 611 (1980). In this case, Hance's conviction and sentence of death in the Jackson murder were affirmed by the Georgia Supreme Court. The Thirkield murder is also included in the Court's summation of the facts. * Hance v. Zant, 456 U.S. 965, 102 S.Ct. 2046, 72 L.Ed.2d 491 (1982). The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari in Hance's habeas corpus appeal in the Jackson murder. * William Henry Hance, Petitioner, v. Walter D. Zant, Warden, Georgia Diagnostic And Classification Center, Respondent United States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit. 696 F.2d 940, cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1210, 103 S.Ct. 3544, 77 L.Ed.2d 1393 (1983). After the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear his first habeas petition in the Jackson case in 1982, the federal appellate court for the 11th Circuit, which includes Georgia, affirmed Hance's conviction but ordered a retrial of the sentencing stage because the prosecutor's closing argument rendered the sentencing proceeding fundamentally unfair, and because two jurors were improperly excluded in violation of Witherspoon v. Illinois, a case about unjust challenges to jury members regarding their death penalty beliefs.Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968). The federal appellate court therefore ordered the state court system to provide a new, more fair, sentencing phase trial for the murder of Jackson. * Hance v. State, 254 Ga. 575, 332 S.E.2d 287, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1038, 106 S.Ct. 606, 88 L.Ed.2d 584 (1985). After a second sentencing trial resulted in another death sentence for the murder of Jackson, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence. * Hance filed another petition for habeas corpus in the Superior Court of Butts County, which is a Georgia state trial court. That court denied his petition after holding an evidentiary hearing. * Hance v. Kemp, 258 Ga. 649, 373 S.E.2d 184 (1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1012, 109 S.Ct. 1658, 104 L.Ed.2d 172 (1989) The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the denial of habeas corpus by the Superior Court of Butts County, and in 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear his appeal of the 1988 Georgia Supreme Court ruling. * After the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the denial of habeas corpus by the Superior Court of Butts County in 1988, Hance then filed a new petition for habeas corpus in the federal District Court for the Middle District of Georgia; that court denied the petition without holding an evidentiary hearing. Hance then appealed to the federal appellate court for the 11th Circuit, which decided the case in January, 1993. * William Henry Hance, Petitioner-appellant, v. Walter Zant, Warden, Georgia Diagnostic & Classification Center, Respondent-appellee United States Court of Appeals, Eleventh Circuit. 981 F.2d 1180 (Jan. 6, 1993). Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied March 11, 1993. In a relatively brief order, a panel of the federal appellate court in the 11th Circuit denied Hance's habeas appeal in the Jackson murder, and denied him the opportunity to present his case to the full appellate bench (instead of the panel). ==Execution== Hance was sentenced to death in civilian court for the murder of Gail Jackson and in military court for the death of Irene Thirkield. His military death sentence for Thirkield was overturned. His civilian death sentence for Jackson was not. He was executed by the state of Georgia on March 31, 1994, via the electric chair. He was the 231st inmate executed nationwide since the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976 and the 18th in Georgia. In the hours before his death, the Supreme Court voted, 6‚Äì3, not to consider his appeal. In dissent, Justice Harry Blackmun said that even if he had not recently Hance had an IQ of 75-79 points, which classifies him as \\"borderline intellectual functioning\\" on modern medical scales of mental retardation. ==Controversy== Other issues besides Hance's mental and psychiatric status had created controversy prior to the day of his electrocution, and one‚Äîthe question of racial bias in the state sentencing jury‚Äîveritably exploded afterwards. The Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles had not even proofread its order denying his stay of execution, and conflated it with another document about some other prisoner. The Georgia Supreme Court denied his appeal by only one vote, 4‚Äì3. One of his jurors at his second sentencing (after the first was reversed for prosecutorial misconduct), a white woman named Patricia Lemay, came forward to report that other jurors made racial remarks about Hance such as \\"just one more sorry nigger that no one would miss\\" and, if executed, he would be \\"one less nigger to breed.\\" There was only one black juror, a 26-year-old woman named Gayle Lewis Daniels. According to Lemay, Daniels was subjected to racial invective in the jury room. According to both Lemay and Daniels herself, Daniels refused to vote for the death penalty. The other jurors ignored her and reported to the judge that they were unanimous. When the jury was polled in the presence of the court, Daniels was by then too frightened to speak up. The other jurors had told her that she could be convicted of perjury if she continued to hold out, since she had testified, during jury selection, that she could vote for the death penalty. The evidence of Lemay and Daniels outraged many press outlets. Said one newspaper afterwards, At a law school conference the following year, attorney Ronald J. Tabak stated at some length his opinion that Hance's race contributed to the sentence.Conference Proceedings: The Death Penalty in the Twenty-First Century, December 1995, American University Law Review. ==In popular culture== Hance was portrayed by Corey Allen in the second season of the Netflix series, Mindhunter. == See also == * List of serial killers in the United States ==References== Category:1952 births Category:1994 deaths Category:20th-century executions by Georgia (U.S. state) Category:American people convicted of murder Category:Crimes against sex workers in the United States Category:Executed African-American people Category:Executed American serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:People convicted of murder by Georgia (U.S. state) Category:People convicted of murder by the United States federal government Category:People convicted of murder by the United States military Category:People executed by Georgia (U.S. state) by electric chair Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by the United States military Category:United States Army soldiers Category:United States Marines Category:1977 murders in the United States Category:20th-century executions of American people Category:American serial killers Category:People executed for murder ","title":"William Henry Hance"},{"id":"20460613","text":"thumb The United Kingdom School Certificate was an educational attainment standard qualification, established in 1918 by the Secondary Schools Examinations Council (SSEC).

Duvauchelle is now part of Christchurch City Council jurisdiction since the city's amalgamation with Banks Peninsula District in 2006. From 1910 until 1989, Duvauchelle was the seat of the Akaroa County Council. Duvauchelle is grouped with other settlements including French Farm, Wainui, Robinson's Bay and Takamatua as the statistical area of Akaroa Harbour. According to the 2013 New Zealand census, Akaroa Harbour has a population of 777, an increase of 42 people since the 2006 census. There were 387 males and 390 females. ==History== The site of an ancient MƒÅori pƒÅ or fortified settlement is at Oinako, where the Duvauchelle Hotel stands today. At Te Wharau creek, a taua or war party of NgƒÅti Awa warriors camped during the battles led by Te Rauparaha in 1831.Christchurch City Libraries - Kaitouna (Duvauchelle) The name of the town and bay comes from the surname of two brothers Jules-Augustin and Louis-Benjamin Duvauchelle, who held land there from the Nanto-Bordelaise Company, at the time of the French settlement at Akaroa in the 1840s. In the following decade, land alongside Duvauchelle Bay was leased from the Canterbury Association by British settlers, including William Augustus Gordon, who was the brother of Charles George Gordon, the famous soldier and colonial administrator, known as \\"Gordon of Khartoum\\" after his death. The first freeholds were bought in 1857; economic activity was focussed on timber extraction and sawing, mostly totara trees. Domestic pigs were grazed in the forest, who mingled with the feral pigs that were already present. As the tree cover was cleared, it was replaced with pasture.H.C. Jacobson, Tales of Banks Peninsula Akoroa 1893 (pp.225-230) The first settler at the Head of the Bay, the location of the present town, was a Frenchman called Libeau, who arrived in 1841. Timber exploitation was also the main activity, as well as boat building. The sawn timber was all carried out of the bay by locally built vessels. A public house and a shop were built in the 1850s. A small building that served as both church and school was built by local people on a half-acre plot of land donated by Lord Lyttelton. The first permanent roads began to be constructed in the 1860s and 1879 saw the arrival of the County Council offices and the Post Office.Jacobson, 1893 (pp.237-241) Both the Duvauchelle Hotel and the post office were badly damaged by the earthquakes that struck the region in 2010 and 2011.

It is the third longest river in the state. ==Course== The river rises near Deadman Hill in the Ophthalmia Range about 30 km south of Newman. The river flows in a northerly direction parallel with the Great Northern Highway until it crosses the highway just south of the Marble Bar turn-off. The river then runs north-west then west crossing the Great Northern Highway again, north of the Auski Roadhouse. Approximately north of Newman, the river flows through the Fortescue Marsh, an important wetland. The river continues to head west crossing Highway 1 at the Fortescue Roadhouse () and discharges into the Indian Ocean at Mardie Station about 40 km south-west of Dampier == Tributaries == The river is known to have 24 tributaries that include: Western Creek, Warrawanda Creek, Shovelanna Creek, Kalgan Creek, Fortescue River South, Cowcumba Creek, Macklin Creek and Tanga Tanga Creek. During Cyclone Joan in 1975 many of these tributaries also flooded. Weeli Wolli Creek and Weelumurra Creek both overflowed and caused floods and washaways on the Hamersley Iron and Mount Newman railway lines. The river flows through a number of permanent water pools on the latter part of its journey including Tarda Pool, Mungowarra Pool, Crossing Pool and Deep Reach Pool. == Catchment == The Fortescue Catchment area drains from the southern side of the Chichester Plateau and the northern side of the Hamersley Range making use of the trough between the two. The valley plains are composed of earthy clays with some cracking clays, loams and hard red soils.

The river then flows through a poorly defined channel as far as Gregory Gorge, when the river starts to form a well defined channel. It then flows through a number of pools before reaching the estuarine area. == Estuary == The mouth of the river is a large estuarine area. The estuary is mostly unmodified, and functions primarily as a result of river energy. The delta formed by the river is tide dominated. The estuary covers a total surface area of The majority of the estuarine area is made up of salt marsh and intertidal flats. A colony of mangroves use the estuary as habitat and occupy an area of . Large female Barramundi are known to inhabit the estuary. ==History== The river was named in 1861 during an expedition by the explorer and surveyor Francis Thomas Gregory, after Chichester Fortescue, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. The traditional owners of the area that the river flows through are the Indjibandi peoples. Mardie Station, at the western end of the river, was established prior to 1883. Three paddocks were fenced, and by that year were carrying about 18,000 sheep. Roy Hill Station, much further inland, was settled in 1886 by Nat Cooke who owned Mallina Station. The first official lease was granted to D. MacKay in 1890 for an area of .

In 1947-48 it aired on Sundays at 2 p.m. Such mysteries were produced and syndicated (1945-48) to individual local radio stations as a \\"barter-trade\\" program to sell advertising to local merchants or trade the advertising announcements for goods, services or premiums, such as prizes awarded to listeners in radio station contests or promotions. To facilitate personalizing the shows to individual stations and insert the local ads, the producers put musical interludes in the shows with enough time for a local announcer to introduce the episode, present the advertiser's message and wrap things up with other local information. Each 30-minute episode featured five mini-mysteries dramatized with actors, organ music and sound effects. Solutions to each mystery were then suggested by a panel of listeners and studio guests. The panelists sometimes shared a common background; for example, on the April 14, 1949 program, the amateur sleuths were gas industry officials.American Gas Association Monthly.

Organist Rosa Rio provided the music. While the premise was simple, the mysteries were well written, requiring some thought to come up with the right answer. Similar to the Ellery Queen's Minute Mysteries, one listened to the story, evaluated the clues, and at the conclusion, matched wits with the sleuths to correctly identify the suspect. It was one of the few interactive radio shows. ==References== Category:1940s American radio programs Category:American radio dramas Category:1940s American game shows Category:1950s American game shows Category:Mutual Broadcasting System programs ","title":"The Five Mysteries Program"},{"id":"20460818","text":"Roy Heinrich, born Elroy Paul Heinrich, Jr., July 31, 1953, is a country music singer and songwriter born in Houston, Texas.

An army of the First French Empire and several foreign auxiliaries (including Polish insurgents) of France besieged the Prussian fortified town of Kolberg, the only remaining Prussian-held fortress in the Prussian province of Pomerania. The siege was not successful and was lifted upon the announcement of the peace of Tilsit. After Prussia lost the Battle of Jena‚ÄìAuerstedt in late 1806, French troops marched north into Prussian Pomerania. Fortified Stettin (Szczecin) surrendered without battle, and the province became occupied by the French forces. Kolberg resisted, and the implementation of a French siege was delayed until March 1807 by the freikorps of Ferdinand von Schill operating around the fortress and capturing the assigned French commander of the siege, Victor-Perrin. During these months, the military commander of Kolberg, Lucadou, and the representative of the local populace, Nettelbeck, prepared the fortress's defensive structures. The French forces commanded by Teuli√®, composed primarily of troops from Italy, succeeded in encircling Kolberg by mid-March. Napoleon put the siege force under the command of Loison; Frederick William III entrusted Gneisenau with the defense. In early April, the siege forces were for a short time commanded by Mortier, who had marched a large force from besieged Swedish Stralsund to Kolberg but was ordered to return when Stralsund's defenders gained ground. Other reinforcements came from states of the Confederation of the Rhine (Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, Saxon duchies and the Duchy of Nassau), the Kingdom of Holland, and France. With the western surroundings of Kolberg flooded by the defenders, fighting concentrated on the eastern forefield of the fortress, where Wolfsberg sconce had been constructed on Lucadou's behalf. Aiding the defense from the nearby Baltic Sea were a British and a Swedish vessel. By late June, Napoleon massively reinforced the siege forces to bring about a decision. The siege force then also concentrated on taking the port north of the town. On 2 July, fighting ceased when Prussia had agreed on an unfavourable peace after her ally Russia suffered a decisive defeat at Friedland. Of the twenty Prussian fortresses, Kolberg was one of the few remaining in Prussian hands until the war's end. The battle became a myth in Prussia and was later used by Nazi propaganda efforts. While prior to World War II the city commemorated the defendants, it started to honor the commander of the Polish troops after 1945, when the city became part of a Polish state. ==Prelude== Within two weeks after the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt (14 October 1806), Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e had pursued the defeated Royal Prussian Army to Pasewalk in Prussian Pomerania. The provincial capital Stettin (now Szczecin), one of twenty Prussian fortresses, capitulated on 29 October making Kolberg, which at that time had about 5,000 inhabitants, the province's only fortress remaining in Prussian hands. Pierre Thouvenout was appointed French governor of Pomerania and sent his envoy Mestram to accept Kolberg's expected capitulation and take control of it. On 8 November 1806, Mestram met with the Prussian commander of Kolberg Louis Maurice de Lucadou (Ludwig Moritz von Lucadou) before its walls. Lucadou's refusal to hand over the fortress came as a surprise to the French generals and the Prussian administration in Stettin, who had already pledged allegiance to the French; it further led part of the defeated Prussian army to take refuge in Kolberg and reinforce the two musketeer battalions of the von Owstien and von Borcke regiments and the 72 guns garrisoned there. Lucadou ordered the Persante (Parseta) river west of Kolberg to be dammed up to flood the area around the fortress, and arranged the construction of Wolfsberg sconce east of the town. Coordination of these measures with Joachim Nettelbeck, representative of the Kolberg citizens, was however impaired by the latter's personal grievances against Lucadou. Among the Prussian soldiers who had retreated to Kolberg after Jena and Auerstedt was secondelieutenant Ferdinand von Schill, who after his recovery from a severe head injury in the house of Kolberg senator Westphal was ordered to patrol the areas west of the fortress with a small cavalry unit. Supplied with information about French movements by local peasants, he succeeded in capturing a number of French officers and soldiers, gathering food and financial supplies in neighboring towns and villages, and recruiting volunteers to his unit from inside and outside Kolberg. Schill's victory in the skirmish of G√ºlzow (7 December 1806), though insignificant from a military point of view, was widely noted as the first Prussian success against the French army - while Prussian king Frederick William III praised Schill as the \\"kind of man now valued by the fatherland\\", Napoleon referred to him as a \\"miserable kind of brigand\\". As a consequence of these successes and Schill's increasing fame, Prussian king Frederick William III ordered him to establish a freikorps on 12 January 1807, which in the following months defended the fortress against French attacks allowing its defenders to complete their preparations for the expected siege with Swedish and British support via the Baltic. Time for preparation was needed since Kolberg lacked sufficient defensive structures, manpower and armament to withstand a siege. The defensive works of the fortress had been neglected, only the port and Kirchhof sconce had been prepared for defense when Prussia feared war with Russia and Sweden in 1805 and 1806, but they had been disarmed in September. By early December 1806, the Kolberg garrison numbered 1,576 men, but increased steadily during the next months due to the arrival of Prussian troops and new recruits from nearby areas. Armament shortages were in part relieved by Charles XIII of Sweden, who sent rifle components from which local gunsmiths made 2,000 new rifles. As of late October 1806, a total of 72 guns were mounted on Kolberg's walls: 58 metal/iron cannons (8x 24 lb, 4x 20 lb, 40x 12 lb, 6x 6 lb), six iron howitzers (10 lb) and eight iron mortars (5x 50 lb, 3x 25 lb); in addition, there were four mobile 3-pounder cannons. While a convoy with artillery reinforcements was held up and captured by French forces near Stettin, twelve 12-pounder cannons reached Kolberg from the Prussian fortress of Danzig and the Swedish fortress of Stralsund, who each sent six guns. Since no further artillery reinforcements came in, the Kolberg garrison mounted an additional 92 guns on the walls which previously had been deemed unusable and withdrawn from service; these guns were positioned at the flanks at it was speculated that they might still serve to fire rocks and canister shots at short distances. Six guns captured by Schill's freikorps were also sent to Kolberg. Claude Victor-Perrin, whom Napoleon Bonaparte had entrusted with taking Kolberg, was captured by Schill's forces in Arnswalde (12 January), detained in Kolberg and later exchanged against Prussian general Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher. With Victor-Perrin captured, the attack on Kolberg was to be led by Pietro (Pierre) Teuli√©'s Italian division, who in February began the march on the fortress from Stettin. Schill's freikorps further delayed the French advance by provoking several skirmishes and battles, the largest of which took place near Naugard (Nowogard). Teuli√© reached the Kolberg area by early March, and by the mid of the month (14 March) had cleared the surrounding villages of Schill's forces and encircled the fortress. ==SiegeMid-March to April=== When the French encirclement of Kolberg rendered Schill's strategy moot, Lucadou sent three cavalry units to aid the Krockow freikorps in the defense of Danzig, while Schill departed to aid in the defense of Stralsund in Swedish Pomerania. The suburbs, most notably Geldernerviertel, were burned down as it was customary. Because of the delay in the French advance, Napoleon replaced Teuli√© as the commander of the siege forces with division general Louis Henri Loison; Frederick William III replaced Lucadou as the commander of the fortress with major August Neidhardt von Gneisenau after complaints by Nettelbeck and out of considerations for an envisioned British landfall at Kolberg - he feared that a French-born commander might irritate his British supporters, while on the other hand Gneisenau had been in British service during the American Revolutionary War. In April, Napoleon withdrew the forces of Edouard Mortier from the siege of Stralsund and sent them to take Kolberg, however, Mortier soon had to return when the defenders of Stralsund pushed the remaining French troops out of Swedish Pomerania. The French siege army was reinforced by troops from W√ºrttemberg and Saxon states (Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Hildburghausen and Saxe-Weimar) as well as a Polish regiment.William Fiddian Reddaway, Cambridge History of Poland, Volume 1, Cambridge University Press, 1971, pg. 228 The Saxon and W√ºrttemberg regiments were part of the army of the Confederation of the Rhine, which - like the Kingdom of Italy, whose troops were already present at the siege - was a French client. The Polish regiment, led by Antoni Pawe≈Ç Su≈Çkowski, with a strength of 1,200 had been transferred from the siege of Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) on 11 April and arrived on 20 April; it was the 1st infantry regiment of the Pozna≈Ñ legion raised by Jan Henryk DƒÖbrowski on Napoleon's behalf, after a Polish uprising against Prussian occupationHistoria Gda≈Ñska Edmund Cie≈õlak Tom 3-page 115, Wydawnictwo Morskie 1993My z Napoleonem Andrzej Nieuwa≈ºny Wydawnictwo Dolno≈õlƒÖskie, 1999, page 35 and French liberation of Prussian controlled Poland had resulted in the creation of Duchy of Warsaw in part of partitioned Poland. : \\"Shortly after his victories over Prussia, Napoleon invaded Prussian Poland. The emperor invited Dabrowski and Wybicki to appeal to the Polish people to revolt but made no commitment to support Polish independence. [...] Wybicki and Dabrowski called on their countrymen to rise up. Many Poles [...] supported the proclamation and welcomed the French. [...] An insurrection quickly liberated western Poland from Prussian rule. In early November 1806, Marshal Davout seized Poznan and soon Dabrowski entered the city. He ordered conscription and assembled an army of 30,000 men. On 2 January 1807, Napoleon triumphantly entered Warsaw. [...] Aware of the enormous power of the Polish nobility, Napoleon intended to acquire its support rather than rely solely on the masses. Indeed, rallying the Polish nobility around his rule was a major characteristic of the Napoleonic government in Poland. [...] For the time being, the Emperor delayed his decision on the establishment of a Polish state. He did set up a provisional government, however, to organize the war effort and run the Polish areas conquered from Prussia.\\" : \\"[pg. 3] After western Poland was liberated from Prussian rule in 1806, General Dombrowski was [pg. 4] recalled from Italian service and directed to establish the new Polish army.

In early May, the siege forces numbered circa 8,000 troops.Dzia≈Çania militarne na Pomorzu Wies≈Çaw Wr√≥blewski, Akademia Obrony Narodowej. Wojskowy Instytut Historyczny, Poland. Ministerstwo Obrony Narodowej. Departament Systemu Obronnego - 2001, page 161 The siege force's blockade corps was since 4 May divided into four brigades: *the first brigade was commanded by Berndes and included one Polish regiment under Antoni Pawe≈Ç Su≈Çkowski. Sulkowski in his diaries wrote that Polish soldiers were highly excited about the prospect of taking the city, as it was once part of Poland during the Piast dynasty. He wrote \\"our soldiers burn with the enthusiasm to move our borders to the pillars of Boles≈Çaw\\", and noted that the chaplain of the Polish soldiers Ignacy Przybylski called upon them Polish soldiers. We are camped under Ko≈Çobrzeg. Since the time of Chrobry our regiment formed in Poznan and Gniezno Voivodeships is the first to show its banners here.Napis. Tom po≈õwiƒôcony literaturze u≈ºytkowej i okoliczno≈õciowej Janusz Maciejewski Latona, 2005 pages 159-160 The brigade also included W√ºrttemberg regiments (Seckendorff, Romig); *the second brigade was commanded by Fontane and included the 1st Italian line infantry regiment (Valleriani) and the infantry regiment Saxe-Weimar (Egloffstein); *the third brigade was commanded by Castaldini and included the 2nd Italian light regiment; *the fourth brigade was commanded by general Bonfanti and included the 1st Italian light regiment (Rougier). The remaining forces, except for the grenadiers, were entrusted with the defense of other sconces in the vicinity of Kolberg. The headquarters of the siege force was in Tramm (now Stramnica), where the grenadiers were concentrated. The artillery, under command of general Mossel, was concentrated near Zernin (now Czernin), and defended by a Saxon detachment stationed in Degow (now Dygowo). The construction of the siege works, was since 5 May supervised by brigade general Chambarlhiac of the 8th corps on Napoleon's behalf. Schill returned to the town in early May, but left for Stralsund again after discord with Gneisenau, taking most of his freikorps with him (primarily the cavalry units). After Schill's departure, the defenders numbered about 6,000 menDigby Smith, The Greenhill Napoleonic Wars Data Book , Greenhill Books, 1998 p. 252 and consisted of *one grenadier battalion with 850 men, commanded by Karl Wilhelm Ernst von Waldenfels, vice commander of the fortress; *one fusilier battalion with 750 men, commanded by M√∂ller; *the 2nd Pomeranian reserve battalion with 540 men; *the 3rd Neumark reserve battalion with 420 men; *the 3rd musketeer battalion von Owstien with 800 men; *the 3rd musketeer battalion von Borcke with 800 men; *of Schill's freikorps, five infantry companies with 750 men and one cavalry squadron with 113 men, commanded by Count Wedell; *two J√§ger companies (Dobrowolski and Otto) with 300 men, later commanded by Arenstorf; *110 cuirassiers from the depot of the von Balliodz regiment; *400 artillerists. On 7 May, in a French reconnaissance attack, troops from the 1st Italian line infantry as well as the Polish, W√ºrttemberg and Saxon regiments assaulted Wolfsberg sconce. During the fight, a Polish unit repelled a charge from the cavalry squadron of Schill's Freikorps (113 troopers). General Loison in a report to Marshal Berthier on 8 May stated that the Poles had stopped a charge of 600 Prussian cavalry in that action. In another attack, launched during the night of 17/18 May, siege force troops managed to take part of Wolfsberg sconce, but had to retreat when in the resulting chaos, W√ºrttemberg troops shot at Italian units. The Prussian forces launched a counter-attack and drove them from the sconce once again. After this, the French general lost confidence in Wurttemberg troops and removed them from the battlefield. Polish troops were extensively used, and according to Louis Loison, showed exceptional determination in the attacks on Wolfsberg sconce.Przemys≈Çaw Kroczy≈Ñski, \\"Udzia≈Ç Polak√≥w w oblƒô≈ºeniu Ko≈Çobrzegu w 1807 roku w ≈õwietle akt znajdujƒÖcych siƒô w Archives HistoriƒÖues de V Armee de Terre w Pary≈ºu\\", \\"Koszali≈Ñskie Zeszyty Muzealne\\", t. 12, 1982, page 75-84 Plan of the siege. Purple: French trenches; dark areas around Kolberg: flooded and rubble of burned suburbs. On 20 May, an arms replenishment for the defenders arrived by sea from Great Britain, containing inter alia 10,000 rifles, 6,000 sabres and ammunition. Some of those supplies, including 6,000 rifles, were however redirected to the defenders of Stralsund. On 30 May, Napoleon ordered the redeployment of Jean Boudet's division to enable it to reach Kolberg on demand within 36 hours, one regiment of the division was ordered to reinforce the siege forces. Wolfsberg sconce, overrun by the French army on 17 May but recovered by the defenders the next day, capitulated on 11 June. Among others, Waldenfels was killed at the Wolfsberg sconce. Also, Teuli√© was lethally injured when a cannonball hit his leg‚Äîaccording to the French Biographie universelle, he died five days later, on 12 May, and his death caused the parties to agree on a 24-hour truce in his honor;\\"Teuli√©\\" in Michaud (ed) (1843): Biographie universelle ancienne et moderne, vol. 41, p. 209. according to H√∂pfner's History of the Prussian Army however, Teuli√® was hit when a 24-hour truce on 11/12 June was concluded after the capitulation of the Wolfsberg sconce, but not observed; and according to the Italian Biografie di Pietro Teulie however, the cannonball hit Teuli√® after 13 June, and five to six days later, he died in Loison's arms in the nearby village of Tramm. Temporarily, the defenders were supported by the British corvette Phyleria and the Swedish frigate af Chapmann, the latter had arrived on 29 April, was commanded by major Follin and armed with 46 guns (two 36-pounders, else 24-pounder cannons and carronades). Also, three fishing boats had been armed with guns and supported the defenders from the sea. A 3-pounder gun was mounted on each of these boats, which had been prepared by Nettelbeck; later, a fourth boat was similarly prepared by lieutenant Fabe. On 3 June during the evening the supporting ships directed artillery fire on the Polish camp, which proved to be ineffective due to strong winds, three hours later an armed expedition of estimated 200 Prussians attempted to land on the beach, and was repulsed in intense fighting by the Polish regiment On 14 June, British artillery replenishments arrived for the defenders, including 30 iron cannons, 10 iron howitzers and ammunition. The guns replaced \\"the many unusable guns on Kolberg's walls\\". Since the fortress had experienced a shortage of light artillery while at the same time it had sufficient cannonball supplies in storage, a Kolberg smith had forged an operative iron 4-pounder gun; further efforts to forge artillery pieces in the fortress were rendered moot by the arrival of the British guns. ===Final days=== In mid-June, the siege forces were reinforced by two Nassau bataillons with a strength of 1,500 to 1,600, Napoleon ordered the narrowing of the encirclement to cut off Kolberg from its port. By the end of June, Napoleon sent in battle-tried French regiments and heavy guns to bring about a decision: on 21 June arrived further artillery pieces and the 4th Dutch line infantry regiment (Anthing's) with a strength of 1,600 to 1,700; on 30 June arrived the 3rd light, 56th line and 93rd line regiments of the Boudet division with a strength of 7,000. Overall, the strength of the siege force had risen to about 14,000 men in the final days. The French forces took the Maikuhle forest held by the remaining soldiers of Schill's freikorps on 1 July. Kolberg was heavily bombarded‚Äîof a total of 25,940 cannonballs fired by the siege force, 6,000 were fired on 1 and 2 July. On 2 July at noon, fighting ceased upon the announcement of the Prusso-French agreement to the Peace of Tilsit. A Prusso-French truce had been signed already on 25 June following the decisive Russian defeat in the Battle of Friedland. Kolberg was one of the few Prussian fortresses which withstood Napoleon's forces until the peace was signed‚Äîothers were Glatz (K≈Çodzko) and Graudenz (GrudziƒÖdz). ===Casualties=== Based on data from the Prussian Military Archive, H√∂pfner lists the casualties for the Prussian garrison of Kolberg (saying it is uncertain whether they included the losses of the Schill freikorps) as follows: {   - ! !! Officers !! Corporals !! Privates -  style=\\"text-align:left\\"  killed in action:  14  23  391 -  style=\\"text-align:left\\"  lethally wounded:  7  28  253 -  style=\\"text-align:left\\"  wounded:  27  104  912 -  style=\\"text- align:left\\"  captured:  6  6  192 -  style=\\"text-align:left\\"  missing:  0  10  149 -  style=\\"text-align:left\\"  deserted:  0  18  316 -  style=\\"text-align:left\\"  discharged as invalids:  1  24  380 - style=\\"font-weight:bold\\"  style=\\"text-align:left\\"  total:  55  213  2,593 } H√∂pfner further reports that *Schill's freikorps lost a total of 682 infantry, 40 artillerists and an unrecorded number of cavalry and j√§ger as dead, wounded, captured or missing; *of the civilian population of Kolberg, 27 died and 42 were wounded, primarily during the two final days. Regarding the casualties of the siege force, H√∂pfner says that the Prussian archives reports list a total of 7,000 to 8,000 dead and wounded, 1,000 of whom were killed and injured during the last two days. H√∂pfner does not cite the number claimed by the French, which he dismissed as \\"worthless,\\" and says that the beforementioned Prussian claim for the total siege force casualties might be exaggerated. The casualty figures cited by Smith in The Greenhill Napoleonic Wars Data Book match H√∂pfner's numbers for the Prussian garrison, as they were used as a source; for the siege force casualties, Smith lists 102 officers and 5,000 men dead and wounded or died of sickness. ==Aftermath== After the announcement of the peace, Kolberg was not occupied by the French army. Already on 3/4 July, Napoleon ordered the bulk of the siege force to march west to Swedish Pomerania and reinforce, under command of Guillaume Brune, the French forces besieging Stralsund. The commander of the siege forces in Kolberg, Louis Henri Loison, likewise departed to the Stralsund pocket and was put in command of a division near Demmin. Ferdinand von Schill and Neidhardt von Gneisenau received the highest Prussian military decoration \\"Pour le M√©rite\\" for their service. Schinkel's town hall During the siege, Kolberg's suburbs had been levelled, more than half of the Old Town was damaged or destroyed by artillery fire, and Kolberg's economy with its two important branches sea trade and salt mining declined. A shortage of coins had led to the circulation of paper money, hand-written by students from the local lyceum on Gneisenau's behalf. The overall damage was at 155,000 reichstalers. Only in the mid-19th century began the reconstruction and modernization of the town and its port. The ruins of the destroyed medieval town hall were replaced by the current building, designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. Kolberg ceased to be a fortress in 1872‚Äîby 1873, most of the defensive works were levelled. ===In popular memory=== The siege itself became a myth in military history of Prussia, which was partially deflated in modern research by Hieronim Kroczy≈Ñski. Nobel laureate Paul Heyse described the events in his successful drama \\"Colberg\\" (1865). Before World War II, a monument in the town's center was dedicated to Gneisenau, Nettelbeck and Schill; Schill's house was marked with a memorial plaque, a redoubt and a street were named after him, and 2 July was a local holiday celebrated by an annual procession. After the war, when the town became Polish, a street in Ko≈Çobrzeg was named after Antoni Su≈Çkowski, the commander of the Polish troops taking part in the siege.map of Ko≈Çobrzeg ===Nazi propaganda movie=== Paul Heyse's drama was exploited in the Nazi propaganda movie Kolberg, which was begun in 1943 and released in 1945 near the end of World War II. At a cost of more than eight million marks, it was the most expensive German film of the Second World War.Erwin Leiser, Nazi Cinema p128 Part of the plot did not match the events‚Äîfor example, while the actual siege had ended because Prussia surrendered, in the movie it ended because the French generals concluded Kolberg could not be taken.Erwin Leiser, Nazi Cinema p. 125-6 187,000 soldiers, 6,000 sailors and 4,000 horses were drawn from the front for the production of the movie.These huge numbers originate from Harlan's memoirs. Several authors consider them exaggerated.

It stands on a site within the Anderston Commercial Zone, an area cleared during the 1960s and designated by the then Glasgow Corporation for \\"comprehensive development\\". Originally the land was earmarked for the second phase of the Anderston Centre complex (early plans show that a public housing tower was planned for the spot where the hotel stands); however, this was abandoned, and the site lay derelict until the late 1980s. As well as being Hilton's first foray into Glasgow (it later took over the prestigious Stakis Grosvenor in the city's West End, and a third hotel was added to the portfolio in Finnieston), the hotel was notable for being the first high-rise building over 20 storeys to be constructed in Glasgow since its tower block building boom of the 1960s and early 1970s. The hotel has the largest banqueting hall in the city. ==Famous guests== The hotel is notable for having accommodated many celebrities, including the former United States President Bill Clinton.

The 'Earth and Fire' group consisted of Sophie Anderton, Natalie Appleton, Antonio Fargas, Sheila Ferguson and Janet Street Porter.

Day 6 The fifth bushtucker trial of the series was titled 'Temple of Doom' and was contested by Paul Burrell. Paul had been shortlisted for the previous four trials. He won six stars.

The eleventh bushtucker trial of the series was titled 'Fill Your Face' and was contested by Antonio Fargas. He won four stars. After the trial ended, he famously bluffed his words and said \\"There's a celebrity in my ear!\\". He meant to say there was a creature in his ear.

Notably it was the 120th ship built by the Cockatoo Island Dockyard and the first aluminium ship built in Australia. ==History== PV Vigilant was a prototype ship designed and built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in 1937‚Äì38. The hull and wheelhouse were constructed entirely of aluminium to save weight. As a result, the ship had a total displacement of only 106 tons. It was built for the Department of Trade and Customs, intended for use patrolling waters to the north of Australia in conjunction with the Kuru. It was initially based at Townsville. ==Naval service== The ship was still undergoing sea trials when it was requisitioned by the Royal Australian Navy in October 1940, commissioning as HMAS Vigilant on 12 November 1940. It was classed as an auxiliary patrol vessel. It was initially equipped with a 3-pounder QF gun but this was replaced with a 20 mm Oerlikon. As well as the mounted gun, it carried a variety of light arms including a Bren light machine gun. The SS Neptuna explodes during the Bombing of Darwin on 19 February 1942. HMAS Vigilant is directly in front of the explosion. Vigilant was transferred to Darwin, Northern Territory in 1941 and was used for protecting the harbour approaches. During the Bombing of Darwin, Vigilant engaged some of the attacking aircraft with its 20 mm Oerlikon and later assisted in picking up survivors from the water in Darwin Harbour. Vigilant, with a hold capacity of 7 tons, played an important role in the Battle of Timor from May 1942 and made several supply trips to the island. During one of these supply voyages, it assisted in the search for survivors from HMAS Armidale. During this time, it also resupplied corvettes operating in the Timor Sea with depth charges. HMAS Vigilant was renamed HMAS Sleuth on 17 April 1944 and HMAS Hawk on 13 March 1945. Hawk was paid off on 12 November 1945. ==Post-war service== After the war, the ship was returned to the Department of Trade and Customs as PV Vigilant, and served as a whaling patrol ship off Western Australia until 1965. Despite attempts to save the ship for preservation, it was scuttled off Sydney in April 1966. ==Legacy== Vigilant Close in Bentley Park, Queensland is named after HMAS Vigilant. Following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, completed in March 2010, the RAN decided that, in recognition of the vessel's wartime service, future ships named HMAS Vigilant would be entitled to carry the honours \\"Darwin 1942‚Äì43\\" and \\"Pacific 1942‚Äì43\\". ==Gallery== Image:Vigilant plan.jpgGeneral arrangement plan Image:Sleuth Castlemaine Benalla.jpgHMAS Sleuth with the corvettes Castlemaine and Benalla off Darwin in 1944. ==References== Category:Patrol vessels of the Royal Australian Navy Category:1938 ships Category:Scuttled vessels of New South Wales ","title":"HMAS Vigilant"},{"id":"20460996","text":"PFC Lokomotiv Stara Zagora was a Bulgarian football club from Stara Zagora, founded on April 1934 as ZHSK (–ñ–°–ö).

When she announces she intends to buy a $2.5 million closed theater in a run-down part of Los Angeles, because it is the location where her late husband proposed to her and it is now threatened to be turned into a parking lot, her daughters decide that they have had enough. Edith and her husband Cabot complain that they are only granted $100,000 a year, and work together with cold-hearted and recently divorced Mildred to discourage Rosie from buying the theater. They are unable to convince her and her legal advisor Oliver to let them take care of her money, and thus decide to try to declare her incompetent, thereby hoping to put her in an insane asylum. Edith and Cabot's young daughter Daphne is appalled to overhear the scheme, and vows to help her grandmother. Daphne rushes to Oliver's office, but runs into his much younger associate David Wheelwright, who promises to help her after an emotional conversation. Oliver is upset to find out that one of his workers is taking matters in own hands, and meets with David to hear him out. David advises that they should put someone with Rosie to prevent her from doing anything outrageous, because their daughters are sending a private investigator to the case. Oliver takes his advice, but sends him on the job. David reluctantly starts the job, but is quickly drawn to Rosie's extraverted personality. Simultaneously, he goes on a few romantic dates with Daphne and they fall in love. After attending a piano recital, Rosie is abducted by two men, and later awakens in a locked rest home for the mentally unstable in the Santa Monica mountains. Rosie is heartbroken to learn that her daughters committed her to a sanitarium, and rejects an offer from Cabot to sign the papers for her release in exchange for making them responsible of her finances. He assures her that they can keep her in the sanitarium indefinitely if she does not obey their wishes, prompting Rosie to reconsider. Meanwhile, Daphne finds out what has happened, and furiously leaves the home, despite her mother's plea not to leave her. With the help of Oliver and David, Daphne enters the rest home and breaks Rosie out. Rosie, who cannot believe what her own daughters did to her, is next sued in court. Mildred and Edith's lawyer puts Rosie's sanity at debate, and Rosie is ready to announce her defeat during the process. Daphne and Oliver console her during the trial, and when Oliver announces his love for her, Rosie decides to fight again.

The child, who at first is thought of by the Bruins as of gentle birth, denounces God and shocks Father Hart. She expounds on the ephemeral nature of life, in a bid to entice the newly-wed Maire to leave with her to the world of faery: You shall go with me, newly-married bride, And gaze upon a merrier multitude.

Colban had many important roles in Norwegian diplomacy; especially being named to the post of Norwegian Ambassador in London before and during the Second World War. Colban also worked with the League of Nations and the United Nations where Norwegian Trygve Lie served as the Secretary- General of the United Nations. == Overview  Personal life === Colban was a son of Captain Erik Andreas Colban (1841‚Äì1900) who was a captain of the Norwegian army. His grandfather Erik Andreas Colban (1760‚Äì1828) had been a dean in the districts of Lofoten and Vester√•len.Colban (Store norske leksikon) In 1911, Colban was married to Karen Marie Holter. The couple's son, Erik Andreas Colban, entered the diplomatic service and was ambassador as was his father. In 1952, Colban published his memoirs about his career as a diplomat in the book Femti √•r (Oslo: Aschehoug). ===Career=== Colban took his final exams in 1895 and then began studying law. He completed his law degree in 1899. Colban entered the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1905. In 1918, Colban took the position as a director of the Minorities Section at the League of Nations. In 1930, Colban went back to the Norwegian foreign service. Special Session of the Assembly (League of Nations Archives) Colban served a Norwegian ambassador to Great Britain (1942‚Äì1946) representing the Norwegian government during World War II and the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. He led the Norwegian delegation that participated in the preparations for the establishment of the United Nations and participated as a Norwegian delegate in the first general meeting. Erik Andreas Colban (Norsk biografisk leksikon) He was also one of four Norwegian members of the United Nations War Crimes Commission, together with Jacob Aars Rynning, Finn Palmstr√∏m and Terje Wold. ===Honors=== Colban was appointed Knight First Class of the Order of St. Olav in 1912, promoted to Commander with Star in 1931 and awarded the Grand Cross in 1946. Additionally, Colban received a number of awards from foreign governments including Commander of the Order of Dannebrog, Commander of the Swedish Order of the Polar Star, holder of the Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown (Belgium) and was a Grand Officier of the French Legion of Honor. == Early life == Erik Colban was born in Kristiania on 18 October 1876. As the son of Erik Andreas Colban (1841‚Äì1900) who was a Captain in the Army and Caroline Emilie Biermann he was part of a long line of clergy and military men and officials dating back to the pre-1814 Danish-Norwegian Kingdom. In 1911 Erik Colban married Karen Marie Holter and the couple had a son, Erik Andreas Colban, who also entered the diplomatic service and became an ambassador like his father. In 1899 Erik finished his law degree and soon after he became a solicitor for the chief administrative officer in Romsdal. In 1901 Erik was employed as a lawyer for Garup Meidel in Oslo until March 1903 where he began working at the Department of Foreign Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trade, Shipping and Industry(Departementet for udenrigske Sager, Handel, Sj√∏fart og Industri). One of his main areas of interest during this period was the dissolution of the Norwegian union with Sweden. The public discussion in Norway concerned whether or not the dissolution of the union was in line with Norwegian Constitutional Law. Despite his position as a civil servant, Erik publicly criticised the union as a matter of Constitutional Law and instead he claimed that the dissolution had been in violation of international law, and was later asked by Fridtjof Nansen to write an account of the issue. In 1905 he went on to pursue an academic career and went to Paris on a scholarship. Upon his arrival in France he was quickly asked to serve at the Norwegian consulate in Le Havre where he moved in 1906. He returned to Oslo in the fall of 1906 as the head of office responsible for the consulate service. In 1908 he moved to Stockholm and was appointed charg√© d'affaires. He carried out his responsibilities in Stockholm until he was offered to move to Rio de Janeiro where he was again appointed charg√© d'affaires in 1911. From 1916 to the end of the First World War he assisted Nils Claus Ihlen who was foreign minister of Norway, on how Norway should handle the war in Europe. He traveled back and forth to London where he met with Sir Cyril William Hurcomb and negotiated payment for the ships that Norway provided for Allied forces. During the war he was also very focused on Norway's contribution to foreign affairs in general. == Director of the League of Nation's Minorities Section. 1919‚Äì1927 == 500x500px === Origins of the Minorities Section === Colban was fundamental in the development of the League of Nations minorities section. As a consequence of the treaties of the 1919- Paris Peace Conference- the League of Nations found itself responsible for monitoring and defending minority groups across Europe. The irregularity of the League Council's meetings and a sense of minority issues being of minor importance, made these issues increasingly treated by the secretariat itself. At the founding of the League of Nations in 1919, the role of the League Secretariat had been envisioned as purely advisory and administrative ‚Äì a collection of experts aiding the workings of the council's delegate. However, the administrative personnel of the secretariat would increasingly have to redefine their own roles and responsibilities in the system. Erik Colban, who became the director of the minorities section of the League of Nations and it's 'spiritual father' in 1919, found himself to be a member of an entirely new class of international bureaucrats. Thus, Colban proved to be an instrumental figure in creating and developing the policy on minorities. He created a system which 'was surprisingly able to keep myriad minority problems from tearing Europe apart far sooner. === Development of the Minorities Section === Through personal interaction and administrative mastery, Colban helped to protect and develop the minorities system. As the League Council initially distanced itself from the responsibility of dealing with minority issues, it gave Colban the liberty to further develop the petition system (as seen below). The Minorities section attempted to develop a practical translation of the unworkable terms of article 12 of the League of Nations. Thus, Colban created a process where minority violations could be addressed through quiet and secret channels. Colban established 1: A formal procedure for receiving and distributing minority petitions 2: A \\"committee-of-three\\" system, whereby every petition deemed receivable by the secretariat was examined by an ad hoc group of council members (the acting president + two selected governments) to determine whether a treaty violation had occurred and if it should or should not be reported to the council. The initial system had thrown the minority petitions onto public stage, with little action taken due to intense public scrutiny. Colban's personal interaction with major governmental figures of minority states was an important instrument to the success of the minorities section. By the end of 1924, Colban and members of the Section had travelled to Belgrade, Sofia, Bucharest, Transylvania, Athens, Bulgaria, Budapest, Vienna, and Prague multiple times, and Colban personally spent around six months each year abroad.Fink (2006) pp. 282 Furthermore, Colban ensured that his Minorities Section undertook an increasing responsibility for the examination and action upon these petitions. Specifically, the Minorities Section employed detailed evaluation of the \\"receivability\\" of petitions. Colban and the Section became instrumental in the formation of and action regarding these petitions, he and his staff became the 'gatekeeper' of the petitions. === Challenges to the system from within the League === Conflicts between the Minorities Section and the minority states eventually proved inevitable. Complaints from the minority states Poland and Czechoslovakia about floods of propagandistic petitionsFink, (2006) pp. 281 and accusations of the committees multiplying minority complaints, led to a challenge from several minority states within the League in 1923. The challenging states attempted to wreck Colban's system of Committee-of-three by means of obstruction and proposals for \\"reform\\".Fink (2006) pp. 281 To avoid endangering League authority, Colban and the secretariat skilfully recalibrated the systems. In September 1923, the council adopted a series of resolutions tightening the rules of receivability of petitions, granting generous extensions to accused governments to prepare their observations and restricting the distribution of all materials to council members alone. Being a beneficial development for minority states and the great powers (putting less pressure in minority states and thus easing tensions in the league), but a decremental development for the minorities themselves, this is an example of the lengths to which Colban was willing to go in order to preserve the system. In spite of an inherent sympathy towards minorities, Colban proved to be a pragmatist by necessity ‚Äì balancing concerns of the minorities with concerns over European peace required skilful political acrobatics.Fink (2006) pp. 281 === Minority activists critique of the system === As Colban and the League system was bound by the principle of state sovereignty, they not only guarded the minority states' interests and dismissed all but the most politically explosive complaints, they also blocked outside improvement proposals. This approach was severely criticised by minority activists such as professor Gilbert Murray, an Oxford classicist,Smejkal (2010) pp. 88 both for its favouring the interests of the minority states over those of the minorities, and for the secrecy involved in dealing with petitions, leading to suspicions of them disappearing in the swollen bureaucracy.Fink (2006) pp. 282 Colban, who defined his task as transforming 30 million individuals into \\"loyal citizens\\", was unmoved by this criticism.Fink (2006) pp. === The effect of Germany upon the Minorities Section === On 25 October 1925, Germany supported financially the organization of a European Minorities Congress. The leaders of the Minority Groups from Eastern Europe met in Geneva. Colban did not want, that this gathering changed the functioning of the minority section of the League by reform proposals. As a consequence, he reinforced the publicity about their achievements. James Eric Drummond, the secretary general of the League and Colban found another way of representing the minorities section, which excluded states, minorities and neighbouring states to participate in the decision making that could concern them in one way or the other. This was a compromise in order to gain support from the neighbouring states of Germany and the German government and was advised by Colban. When Germany received its permanent seat at the council in 1926, Colban started tutoring Stresemann on how to attend to minority affairs. He even succeeded in convincing the German delegates to wait a year before participating in the minorities section, until they understood the situation completely. This manoeuvre kept Germany from presenting any questions regarding minorities to the general assembly until 1930. Working with the Germans, Colban managed to convince them that theLeague's system of secret compromise was effective and desirable. No changes were made in the section while Colban was in office. It was only in regards to the petitioners that changes were made, but the changes of the internal structure could not gain approval. When changes to the minorities section were laid for the general assembly later on, Chamberlain opposed the changes and argued it worked properly during Colban's leadership. == Late career == In his late career, Colban held several important positions working both as an international bureaucrat and as a representative for the Norwegian government. From 1927 to 1930, Colban worked as the director of the disarmament section of the League ‚Äì disarmament being, Colban though, among the most crucial issues in order to secure peace. On this issue, Colban faced increasing resistance from the Great Powers (in particular Britain and France). 350x350px In 1930 Colban returned to the Foreign Service as envoy to Paris and Brussels and Luxembourg. He remained in touch, however, with the League of Nation environment and became the Norwegian delegate to the disarmament conference and to the League's annual sessions. Moreover, he was actively engaged in the Manchuria conflict. Colban left the League of Nations in 1934, when he was appointed as envoy to London (Ambassador from 1942). Erik Colban, now an experienced diplomat, belonged to the traditional school of diplomats used to act only on instruction from the government. Following the German invasion of Norway, 9 April 1940, Colban was cut off from communication with the government. Not receiving instructions, Colban was accused of inaction, especially in relation to orders to the merchant fleet. Later, Colban would be involved in setting up the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Mission (Nortraship), a crucial contribution to the Allied War effort. The Norwegian exile-government had much use of Colban's language skills and diplomatic know-how. In 1941 Colban headed the committee drafting the Norwegian-British military agreement, and it was not least thanks to his efforts that Norway reached a very favourable settlement with Britain in 1943. Towards the end of the war, Colban influenced the Norwegian government's decision to support a United Nations dominated by the great powers, and he was appointed the Norwegian delegate to the UN's first general assembly in 1945. In 1943, he became a member of the United Nation's War Crimes Commission and the inter-allied committee that set up the International Court of Justice in The Hague. After his retirement as ambassador in 1946, Colban was still a part of diplomatic life. From 1946-47 he was chairman of the Norwegian delegation for the preparation of a broad international UN conference on trade and administration. He was also the Norwegian delegate to the Havana Conference during 1947‚Äì48. As a final point in his career from 1948 to 1950 Colban became the personal representative for the UN secretary general Trygve Lie, in the negotiations between India and Pakistan concerning Kashmir. In 1952 Colban published his autobiography Fifty Years (Femti Aar). === The question of individual rights vs. state rights === After the Second World War, the question about international law and national sovereignty was a broadly discussed issue. The founding of the United Nations brought a different approach to the question of human rights. The focus of the League of Nations was a commitment to collective rights of the states themselves, and now the postwar approach was centered on individual human rights. However, minority protection was regarded as weak and obscure. As a member of the UN, Colban was opposed the idea of a European superstate and to strong interference into national issues. This was due to the problems he experienced arising from the interference of the League of Nations into minority politics in Eastern Europe during the interwar period. Acknowledgement of the sovereignty of the nation- states was a key concern of the UN and this was a point in its Charts, which was not to be changed, in order to secure peace. It was absolutely imperative to avoid repeating the mistakes of the League of Nations. === The UN as a tool for peace === For Colban the primary aim of the UN as well as of the League of Nations was keeping the peace. Unlike the League of Nations, it was to be a permanent organization, but also a world organization, in order to be able to preserve peace. He saw the reason for the failure of the League of Nations in the fact, that important nation states were not members. In order to be able to do better, the UN was to include all states willing to participate and work against the possibility of countries of resigning. This opinion of Colban was also to be understood against the background of the Cold War. He sensed, that if the UN was not able to keep the Soviet Union as a member, this would endanger peace. He even proposed, if the statutes of the UN was to be updated, member resignation should be made impossible. At the same time, he was contemplating weakening the veto, with which USSR was making things difficult. He thought that the specialized agencies of the UN were a very important part of the organisation, their work indirect, but indispensable for world peace. == Reflections on international institutions == In 1954, when Colban was retired, he wrote an article titled The United Nation As A Permanent World Organisation where he reflected on the UN and League of Nations. In the article he gave his thought on whether or not the UN would survive or if it would fail like its predecessor had. He especially focused on what had been done wrong in the League of Nations, and what, as a consequence, had been changed in the UN charters. One of his main statements was that the tasks of the UN should be both political and non-political, meaning that it should secure peace, but at the same time working towards solving economic, social, cultural and humanitarian issues. Another very important element he mentions that should secure the survival of the UN was that every nation was a member and that it should not be allowed to withdraw ones membership, which was not the case with the League of Nations. He quotes a Spanish official in saying that it would be impossible to imagine a world without an institution such as the UN. ==References Bibliography == Category:1876 births Category:1956 deaths Category:People from Oslo Category:Ambassadors of Norway to the United Kingdom Category:Norwegian people of World War II Category:Commanders of the Order of the Dannebrog Category:Commanders of the Order of the Polar Star Category:Grand Officiers of the L√©gion d'honneur Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Crown (Belgium) ","title":"Erik Colban"},{"id":"20461289","text":"Stephanus (\\"Fanie\\") Johannes du Plessis (23 February 1930 - 13 August 2001) was a discus thrower and shot putter, who represented South Africa at two Summer Olympics in 1956 and 1960.Biography sports-reference He was twice gold medalist at the Commonwealth Games (in 1954 and 1958, then known as the British Empire and Commonwealth Games) in the men's discus throw event. ==Biography== Stephanus (\\"Fanie\\") Johannes du Plessis was born on 23 February 1930 in Lichtenburg, South Africa.

Eikonoklastes (from the Greek Œµ·º∞Œ∫ŒøŒΩŒøŒ∫ŒªŒ¨œÉœÑŒ∑œÇ, \\"iconoclast\\") is a book by John Milton, published October 1649. In it he provides a justification for the execution of Charles I, which had taken place on 30 January 1649. The book's title is taken from the Greek, and means \\"Iconoclast\\" or \\"breaker of the icon\\", and refers to Eikon Basilike, a Royalist propaganda work. The translation of Eikon Basilike is \\"icon of the King\\"; it was published immediately after the execution. Milton's book is therefore usually seen as Parliamentarian propaganda, explicitly designed to counter the Royalist arguments. ==Background== Milton was commissioned to write Eikonoklastes as a response to Charles I's supposed Eikon Basilike (1649). The tract was intended to be the official argument by the Commonwealth government. Eikon Basilike was published just after Charles I's execution, and the work portrayed him as a martyr. The piece was written with straightforward political aims, to stir up popular sentiment in support of the former monarch and to undermine the control of the Commonwealth government. The work proved so popular that there were 35 editions produced that year. Milton's approach was different from that of Eikon Basilike, which may have in fact been a composite work with John Gauden involved in ghostwriting: instead of appealing to popular sentiment, Milton's work was closely argued and tried to meet each of the points in the Eikon.Dobranski 1999 p. 15Holly Faith Nelson, Jim Daems, Eikon Basilike: The Portraiture of His Sacred Majesty in His Solitudes and Sufferings: with Selections from Eikonoklastes. 2006. pp. 19‚Äì20. Milton believed, certainly, that the Eikon Basilike created a false idol and he wanted to destroy it with truth.Raymond 2003 p. 206 Eikonoklastes, titled Eikonolastes in Answer to a Book Intitl'd Eikon Basilike, The Portrature of his Sacred Majesty in his Solitudes and Sufferings, was issued in two versions in October 1649, in English, and was enlarged in 1650. It was quite soon translated into Latin and French. In 1651 a reply appeared, Eikon Aklastos (\\"the icon unbroken\\").Zwicker 1993 p. 37 It was written by Joseph Jane, involved in royalist organisation.Peacey 2004 p. 107 == Tract == Milton begins his work by mentioning that he was commissioned to write Eikonoklastes and that he did such for the good of the Commonwealth:Corns 1999 p. 94 \\"I take it on me as a work assign'd rather, then by me cho'n or affected\\".Milton 1962 p. 339 The central argument of Eikonoklastes involves the tyranny inherent in all monarchies, and Milton attacks the idea put forth by Charles I that the liberty of individuals consistsDzelzainis 2003 p. 307 \\"in the enjoyment of the fruits of our industry, and the benefit of those Laws to which we our selves have consented\\".Milton 1962 p. 574 Milton's response is to point out how such a definition cannot actually separate different kinds of governments: > First, for in the injoyment of those fruits, which our industry and labours > have made our own upon our own, what Privilege is that, above what the > Turks, Jewes, and Mores enjoy under the Turkish Monarchy? For without that > kind of Justice, which is also in Argiers, among Theevs and Pirates between > themselves, no kind of Government, no Societie, just or unjust could stand; > no combination or conspiracy could stick together. We expect therfore > something more, that must distinguish free Government from slavish To Milton, Charles I was able to coerce the English people and actually made them his slaves, especially through his veto power which established him \\"as the transcendent and ultimat Law above all our Laws; and to rule us forcibly by Laws to which we ourselves did not consent\\".Milton 1962 p. 575 Milton attacks Charles I's rhetorical flourishes throughout Eikon Basilike, and he claims thatCorns 1999 p. 95 \\"the whole Book might perhaps be intended a peece of Poetrie\\".Milton 1962 p. 406 Milton criticises every aspect of Eikon Basilike to the point that when Charles I claims that he was with gentlemen, Milton responds \\"Gentlemen indeed; the ragged Infantrie of Stewes and Brothels\\".Milton 1962 p. 380 However, the criticism was not limited to just style and images. In response to Charles I coining the term \\"demagogue\\", Milton claims that the word is an attack on the English language and the English people:Corns 1999 p. 88 \\"the affrightment of this Goblin word; for the King by his leave cannot coine English as he could Money, to be current\\".Milton 1962 pp. 392‚Äì393 In the second edition, Milton expanded his claim that the supporters of Charles I wereRaymond 2003 p. 207 an \\"inconstant, irrational, and Image-doting rabble\\" to declare: > that like a credulous and hapless herd, begott'n to servility, and inchanted > with these popular institutes of Tyranny, subscrib'd with a new device of > the Kings Picture at his praiers, hold out both thir eares with such delight > and ravishment to be stigmatiz'd and board through in witness of thir own > voluntary and beloved baseness.Milton 1962 p. 601 Milton also altered an epigraph by Sallust on the title page that comes from Gaius Memmius's speech in Bellum Iugurthinum. The speech penned by Sallust for Memmius describes various abuses, and is used to argue that all monarchs are corrupt.Dzelzainis 2003 pp. 307‚Äì308 In addition to a discussion of Charles I and monarchy, Milton adds a response to Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, who wrote The History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars.Shawcross 1993 p.273 == Themes == Milton argues that in all monarchical governments there is potential for enslaving the population, which was an argument he previously relied on in his The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates. Milton's view of freedom was not limited to just having the right to property, but to be free from the potential of arbitrary domination by a monarch. Monarchy was not the only subject of importance to Milton within Eikonoklastes; Milton also defended Calvinistic principles, and he claims that reformation cannot accept episcopal or monarchical control. Instead, a presbyterian based religion was the only proper type of religion.McDill 1942 pp. 267‚Äì268 To John Shawcross, Milton's experience while writing the piece, along with the two Defences \\"supplied the experience with the world, that dark world and wide, that seems to have been needed for Milton to move beyond the defiant to degrees of understanding, if not acceptance, of humankind.\\"Shawcross 1993 p. 240 Starting in 1649, Milton began to connect his various prose publications with the plan of a future epic to be composed, and Eikonoklastes was one such work.Shawcross 1993 p. 213 As such, there are multiple parallels between the actions of Charles I monarchy and Satan's rule in hell found within Paradise Lost. The description of a rise of an antichristian monarchs near the end of Eikonoklastes declares that such individuals rely on an ambiguous language to gain power. Likewise, Milton's Satan relies on the same kind of rhetoric. Likewise, the deviant followers of Charles I are connected to demons in hell who drink and blaspheme.Loewenstein 2003 pp. 350‚Äì351 ==Critical review== The work failed: it is the general view that Milton's work did not succeed, at least in terms of rebutting the Eikon Basilike. On the other hand, scholars still debate exactly what the polemic intention of Milton's work was. This book was the first work by Milton to be at all widely read.Danielson 1999 p. 239 Public sentiment still supported Charles I, but the tract was able to appeal to a larger audience than many of Milton's previous works.Von Maltzahn 1999 p. 239 After the English Restoration of 1660, Milton and other republicans faced a vindictive new Government, and Eikonoklastes was said to have justified regicides.Von Maltzahn 1999 p. 241 The Act of Oblivion was enacted on 29 August 1660, and Milton was not among those who were listed to suffer the death penalty for their part in Charles I's execution. On the other hand, a proclamation by the king demanded that Eikonoklastes and Defensio pro Populo Anglicano be burned. The works were soon after burned in public by the public hangman.Pfister 2002 p. 54 This did not stop the work attracting readers, and there was a new edition in 1690 after the Glorious Revolution.Shawcross 1993 p. 278 == Notes  References == * Corns, Thomas. \\"Milton's prose\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Milton.

The program sparked controversy before the first episode had been broadcast. Cherin Awad, one of the hosts, had made a statement in the show Existens five years earlier which some interpreted as her condoning stoning because of sexual infidelity. Another controversy emerged when author Carl Hamilton appeared for an interview and insisted on shaking the presenter's hands. Two of the hosts refused, as it would have violated their religious beliefs. This sparked a heated discussion between Hamilton and the hosts which was later published by SVT. ==Episodes== {  - !Episode !Date !Subject !Guests - 1 2008-11-03 The Class Society Carl Hamilton, Mona Sahlin - 2 2008-11-10 Equality Nyamko Sabuni - 3 2008-11-17 Beauty ideals Bingo Rim√©r, Louise Bratt, Isabella L√∂wengrip - 4 2008-11-24 Alcohol Leif Silbersky, Maria Larsson - 5 2008-12-01 Sex Charlotta Levay - 6 2008-12-08 The Cost of Immigration Jimmie √Ökesson, Tobias Billstr√∂m - 7 2008-12-15 Sports as a Religion Kutte J√∂nsson, Petter Karlsson } ==References== Category:Sveriges Television original programming ","title":"Halal-TV"},{"id":"20461378","text":"This page is a list of the episodes of The Outer Limits, a 1995 science fiction/dark fantasy television series.

Prior to and during World War II it manufactured many firearms, including the Karabiner 98k, the MP40 and other submachine guns. The company is also noted for having produced various forms of military training rifles, including the famous EL 24 subcaliber \\"Barrel Insert\\" training devices that allowed .22 long rifle ammunition to be fired from infantry rifles such as the Karabiner 98 and Steyr-Mannlicher M1895 through use of a special action conversion kit and a thin-walled .22 caliber barrel inserted within the larger rifle's bore. ==History== EMP SMG displayed in Warsaw Uprising Museum The Erfurter Maschinen- und Werkzeugfabrik GmbH was formed in 1922 in Erfurt, Thuringia, by Berthold Geipel. At the beginning of the 1930s the company started its firearms business, acquiring licenses to produce Mauser carbines like the 'Karabiner 98k' and rights to manufacture submachine guns ('Machine Pistols'), which received the designation 'EMP' for 'ERMA Maschinenpistole'.Die Maschinenpistole 40, Berthold Geipel - mp40.nl ==Firearms Production== ERMA MP 44, prototype SMG Die 'EMP' series was based on designs by Heinrich Vollmer which had been bought by Geipert in the early 1930s. These SMGs would be produced in different variants from 1932 (as direct copies of the Vollmer models) to 1938 and sold in Germany, but also to Spain, Mexico, China and Yugoslavia. The Spanish acquired a license for domestic production later on. By 1935 a license to produce repeating rifles of the Mauser Model 98 system has been acquired, production would go on until the early 1940s mid-war. Pre- war conversion kits as training devices, with subcaliber 'Insert Barrels' like the type 'Erma EL 24' (EL for 'Einstecklauf'), would also be sold for those weapons systems. In 1933 Berthold's brother Elmar Geipel is hired by the company. In 1934 the enterprise was renamed to Erfurter Maschinenfabrik B. Geipel GmbH, or 'ERMA' for short. In 1937 Berthold Geipel is appointed Wehrwirtschaftsf√ºhrer of Erfurt by the Nazi regime. From the version 'EMP 36' of ERMA the SMG 'MP 38' and the following model 'MP 40' had been developed under the guidance of Vollmer, and been accepted by the german Wehrmacht, been put into production. In 1943 another SMG had been constructed by the 'ERMA- Werke', the 'Erma EMP 44', a very simplified Machine Pistol, which could have been manufactured with speed and in great numbers. Such a crudely designed firearm was not approved by the Wehrmacht at that time. Later reconsiderations on the viability for a setup to manufacture the firearm led to nowhere, although there had been certain demand by the end of the war. Similar designs for such simple SMGs had been met with success and these were issued in numbers to the Soviet army (PPS submachine gun) and the British (Sten gun), to be used effectively for decades. During the war part of the Geipel enterprise was located at the Altonaer Stra√üe 25 in Erfurt, an area on the campus of the Fachhochschule Erfurt, founded in 1991. Furthermore, since about 1940 a forced labour camp ('Zwangsarbeitslager') for the nearby weaponry manufacture plants had been erected in the vicinity of said Fachhochschule. Around 2000 workers had been re-settled there in shacks to keep production going.Fachhochschule Erfurt - News, 01.04.2009 (german) ==Post war== ERMA Gas Revolver EGR 66X In 1945 Geipel was arrested and imprisoned by the Allied occupation forces in Germany due to his involvement with the Nazi party. He was eventually freed and underwent denazification, after which he worked for 'Vollmer GmbH' as Assistant Director to Heinrich Vollmer. Following the end of the war, the Thuringia region found itself in the Soviet occupation zone. Marshal Zhukov of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany ordered what was left of the 'ERMA' assets to be liquidated on August 31st 1948. Geipel re-established the company under the brand name ERMA-Werke in Bavaria in 1949 and in 1952 the company moved to Dachau, near Munich. Geipel's son Rudolf became the Chief Engineer of the new company and for the first few years production was devoted to household appliances. Around 1952 'ERMA' was awarded a contract by the government of West Germany to service and produce parts for the various Allied forces weapons that had been supplied to the German police forces, notably M1 Carbines. The company also commenced manufacture of gas pistols and revolvers (like EGR 66), and rifles a.o. with lever actions. Following the foundation of the Bundeswehr in May 1955, the Federal government gave ERMA permission to research and develop a new submachine gun; the aim was to replace the weapons given by the Allied forces to both West Germany's police and army. ERMA's design was, however, outbid and out-performed by a submission of the Uzi, which became the 'MP 2' issued to the German Army (Deutsches Heer). In the 1960s the Walther MP would be issued to the German Navy (Bundesmarine) and used by federal police forces. The financial resources expended in developing the new submachine gun had been quite substantial, and as a consequence 'ERMA- Werke' were taken over in 1961 by 'Fiberglide', a division of Lear-Siegler, which traded under the 'ERMA' brand name. Berthold Geipel and his son left the company. In October 1997 'ERMA Werke' commenced bankruptcy proceedings and in 1998 was taken over by 'Suhler Jagd- und Sportwaffen GmbH' (later 'Merkel'), at that time a division of Steyr-Mannlicher. An 'ERMA Suhl' logo was used on their products for a while. By 2004 Heckler & Koch had taken over the Thuringian company forming the 'H&K; Jagd und Sportwaffen GmbH' as hunting and shooting sports section under the 'Merkel' brand name, following which the 'ERMA' name and brand ceased to exist for manufacturing firearms. ==Firearms manufactured== *EMP / MPE * MP38 / MP40 *EMP 44, experimental low cost SMG *EG 70, an M1 Carbine copy, ERMA manufactured parts for these weapons in the early 1950s and produced a .22 caliber training rifle modeled after the carbine that proved so popular it was commercially marketed as the EM-1 and available in .22 WMR * Various low cost .22 caliber pistols resembling the Luger pistol * KGP 68, .380 (9mm kurz) Luger pistol Clone *ESP 85A, target pistol. *TP 22, .22 caliber pistols resembling the PPK. *TP 25, .25 ACP variant of the TP-22 pocket pistol. *ET 22, .22 caliber pistols with 11 inch barrels for the West German Navy. * Ithaca Model 72 Saddlegun, in .22LR and .22WMR * EGR 66 and 66X, gas revolver, Smith & Wesson-Revolvers Model 36 copy, 66X is the stainless steel version ==Further reading== * A.

It was founded in 1760 and is Norway's oldest scientific and scholarly institution. The society's Protector is King Harald V of Norway. Its membership consists of no more than 435 members elected for life among the country's most prominent scholars and scientists. The society‚Äôs Danish name predates both written standards for Norwegian and has remained unchanged after Norway‚Äôs independence from Denmark in 1814 and the spelling reforms of the 20th century. ==History== DKNVS was founded in 1760 by the bishop of Nidaros Johan Ernst Gunnerus, headmaster at the Trondheim Cathedral School Gerhard Sch√∏ning and Councillor of State Peter Frederik Suhm under the name Det Trondhiemske Selskab (the Trondheim Society). From 1761 it published academic papers in a series titled Skrifter. It was the northernmost learned society in the world, and was established in a time when Norway did not have universities or colleges. Lederartikel i Morgenbladet fra 5.mars 2010 til DKNVS 250-√•rs jubileum It received the royal affirmation of its statutes on 17 July 1767, and was given its present name at a ceremony on 29 January 1788, king Christian VII of Denmark's birthday. In 1771, when Johann Friedrich Struensee took over the de facto rule of Denmark-Norway, Johan Ernst Gunnerus was summoned to Copenhagen, where he was given the mission to establish a university in Norway. Gunnerus did not suggest that the university be established in Trondhjem, but in southern Christianssand (Kristiansand), due to its proximity to Jutland. If this happened, he would have the Society of Sciences and Letters moved to Christianssand, to correspond with the new university. However, the plan was never carried out. Struensee's reign ended in 1772, but he reportedly dismissed the plan before this. (Kristiansand got its university in 2007.) The society was housed in the premises of Trondheim Cathedral School until 1866, when it acquired its own localities. Since 1903 its main task was to run a museum. In 1926 there was a split in which the museum became a separate entity, receiving the assets of the learned society. Also in 1926, another publication series Det Kongelige Norske Videnskabers Selskab Forhandlinger was inaugurated. Ownership of the museum was transferred to the University of Trondheim in 1968, today the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, but DKNVS re-received some assets in a 1984 reorganization, and now controls these assets through the foundation DKNVSS. A history of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters was written in 1960 by Hans Midb√∏e, and released in two volumes. In connection with the 250th anniversary of the Society, H√•kon With Andersen, Brita Brenna, Magne Nj√•stad, and Astrid Wale wrote an updated history. Also, Arild Stubhaug wrote a shorter history, prepared for a general audience. ==Organisation== The board of directors consists of seven people, five men and two women. It is led by praeses Steinar Supphellen and vice-praeses Kristian Fossheim. Other board members are Hanna Mustaparta, Britt Dale, Ola Dale, Joar Grimsbu and Asbj√∏rn Moen. The daily administration is led by a secretary- general; Kristian Overskaug. The board is responsible for awarding the Gunnerus MedalYngvar Reichelt (in Norwegian): Det Kongelige Norske Videnskabers Selskabs medaljer. Sic nos: non nobis. Akademika forlag 2013. for academic achievement. The medal was inaugurated in 1927. Before 1815, the sitting King held the title of praeses, while the highest-ranked non-royal member was vice praeses. In the tradition of Gunnerus the bishop, the latter post was filled by clerics until 1820, when Christian Krohg took the seat. From 1815 the King holds the title of \\"protector\\". Today King Harald V of Norway is protector of the society. Members of the learned society are divided into two divisions, Letters and Sciences. In 2005 there were 470 members, of whom 134 were foreign. This is a marked increase from 1996, when it had 399 members, of whom 94 were foreign. == Awards == The society awards the following prizes: === Gunnerus Sustainability Science Award === The Gunnerus Sustainability Science Award is the society's highest award. It is awarded for outstanding scientific work that promotes sustainable development globally. As of 2017 the prize is awarded by DKNVS in collaboration with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.NTNU's information on the award The award was established in 2012, as a cooperation between DKNVS, Sparebanken Midt- Norge and the foundation Technoport.

It used William Armstrong's new and innovative rifled breechloading mechanism. It remained in use until 1902 when replaced by more modern Breech Loading (BL) guns. == Design history == The Armstrong \\"screw\\" breech had already proved successful in the RBL 12 pounder 8 cwt field gun, and the British Government requested it be implemented for heavier guns despite Armstrong's protests that the mechanism was unsuited to heavy guns.Ruffell, The Armstrong Gun Part 5: British revert to Muzzle Loading Guns were produced at both the Royal Gun Factory in Woolwich, and the Elswick Ordnance Company. Like other early Armstrong guns they were rifled on a polygroove system, firing a variety of lead coated projectiles. == Variants == The first version weighed 32 cwt, followed by the 35 cwt version which introduced a longer and stronger breech-piece.Treatise on Manufacture of Service Ordnance, 1877 A 32 cwt variant having a horizontal sliding-wedge breech instead of the Armstrong screw with vertical vent-piece was introduced in 1864 as an attempt to address the perceived weaknesses of the screw-breech design.

A wooden siege carriage with wheels and attached limbers, enabled the guns to be drawn by teams of heavy horses. For guns mounted in fortifications they could be mounted on two different types of carriage. The first was an iron traversing carriage, enabling the gun to be traversed right and left, with recoil being absorbed with a carriage being mounted on a slide. Others were mounted on high \\"siege travelling carriages\\" for use as semi-mobile guns in forts, firing over parapets. Many were re-issued to Volunteer Artillery Batteries of Position from 1889, with 40 Pounders among 226 guns issued to the Volunteer Artillery during 1888 and 1889.Report on the Account of Army Expenditure from 1888‚Äì1889, The National archives, WO33/50 The 1893 the War Office Mobilisation Scheme shows the allocation of thirty Artillery Volunteer position batteries equipped with 40 Pounder guns which would be concentrated in Surrey and Essex in the event of mobilisation.Mobilization Tables for Home Defence, List of Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteer Units, HMSO, London, 1893 They remained in use in this role until 1902 when they were gradually replaced by 4.7-inch Quick Firing (QF) guns.

The war began when Great Britain, fearful of what it saw as growing Russian influence in Afghanistan, invaded the country from British India. The first phase of the war ended in May 1879 with the Treaty of Gandamak, which permitted the Afghans to maintain internal sovereignty but forced them to cede control over their foreign policy to the British. Fighting resumed in September 1879, after an anti-British uprising in Kabul, and finally concluded in September 1880 with the decisive Battle of Kandahar. === Colony of Victoria service === The Australian colony of Victoria received six 35 cwt guns in August 1865.

The Albion press is a model of early iron hand printing press, originally designed and manufactured in London by Richard Whittaker Cope (d. 1828?) around 1820. It worked by a simple toggle action, unlike the complex lever-mechanism of the Columbian press and the Stanhope press. Albions continued to be manufactured, in a range of sizes, until the 1930s. They were used for commercial book-printing until the middle of the nineteenth century, and thereafter chiefly for proofing, jobbing work and by private presses. Francis Meynell often used an Albion to proof pages of his designs for Nonesuch Press books, and printed some small books and ephemera using the press. Printers still predominantly using an Albion Press in the United Kingdom to publish limited fine press editions include Ian Mortimer's I.M. Imprimit, and the St James Park Press of James Freemantle. After Cope's death, Albions were manufactured by his heirs and members of the Hopkinson family (trading initially as 'Jonathan and Jeremiah Barrett' and later as 'Hopkinson and Cope'), who are said to have improved the design. From the 1850s onwards Albion presses were manufactured under licence by other firms, notably Harrild & Sons, Miller and Richard, and Frederick Ullmer Ltd. The toggle-action, and the distinctive shape and 'crown' finial of the Albion, make it instantly recognizable. ==References== *Stone, Reynolds. The Albion press.

See also: The lower eight floors are for commercial use and the upper twelve floors are for residential use. In 1983, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. From the time of its construction and up until the mid 1990s, the building had been owned and occupied by AmSouth Bancorporation and its predecessors. After AmSouth relocated employees to its other downtown offices and its Riverchase Campus, the building was sold to a group of developers. In 2000, it was renovated at a cost of $20 million. It served as the corporate headquarters of Cadence Bank and its predecessor bank until 2013 when it relocated to the Concord Center. The building now serves as the corporate headquarters for Shipt, which has its logo on the south-side of the building. ==ReferencesExternal links== *http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=johnhandbuilding-birmingham-al-usa *http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=997 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Birmingham, Alabama Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1912 Category:Residential buildings completed in 1912 Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Birmingham, Alabama Category:Neoclassical architecture in Alabama Category:Commercial buildings in Alabama Category:1912 establishments in Alabama Category:Skyscrapers in Birmingham, Alabama Category:Residential skyscrapers in Alabama ","title":"John Hand Building"},{"id":"20461601","text":"Jo√£o Baptista Martins (3 September 1927 ‚Äì 16 November 1993) was a Portuguese footballer who played as a striker. ==Club career== Born in Sines, Set√∫bal District, Martins signed with Sporting CP at the age of 19 for 100 escudos, after leaving G.D.

Included in the gardens are an Italian garden, a walled garden, a rose garden, and the Japanese garden. The buildings in the garden are the Conservatory, the Fernery and the Showhouse. The gardens are owned by the National Trust and administered by Cheshire East Council. They are on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens and have been designated at Grade II*. The gardens are open to the public at advertised times. ==History== Monument The first formal gardens were created around the early 18th-century house and consisted of a walled garden to the south of the house, a formal semicircular pond to its north and formal lines of trees to the east and west. Later Samuel Wyatt set out an avenue of beeches to the south, which is now the Broad Walk. An arboretum was created during the 18th century and additions have been made to it since. The earliest reference to the arboretum is in 1795 when between five and ten species were present. The first formal garden to be created for the present house was Charlotte's Garden, designed by Lewis William Wyatt in 1814. Lewis also designed the sandstone Conservatory, which was originally joined to the house by a glass passageway. This was also known as the Orangery because for a time it was used for growing oranges. In the 1830s, a copy of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates in Athens was placed at the end of the Broad Walk. Gardens were established along the sides of the Broad Walk, including the Leech Pool and the area containing the Golden Brook. In 1847, the terraces to the south of the house were laid out as an Italian Garden by Edward Milner to a design by Joseph Paxton. Later in the century, in 1883, Wilbraham Egerton added the stone balustrade. The statue of Neptune, which came from Venice, was added in 1920. Over the years changes have been made to this garden, and it was restored to its original design in 1986. In 1859, the Fernery had been built to a design by George Stokes, Paxton's assistant and son-in-law, to the west of the Conservatory to house tree ferns from New Zealand. The Fernery was seen in the TV miniseries Brideshead Revisited. Japanese Garden showing the Shinto Shrine In 1910, inspired by a visit to the Anglo-Japanese Exhibition in London, Alan de Tatton created a Japanese garden with strong western influences, making it a prime example of the Anglo-Japanese style.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/step-into-a- rarity-an-anglo-japanese-garden-that-works-5gdvsq8wcwb Artefacts within the garden, including the Shinto shrine, are believed to have been brought from Japan for the construction of the garden. In 1913, Alan de Tatton laid out the Rose Garden for his wife which contained a pool for bathing. Maintenance work in this garden had to be completed by 10.00 am. to allow Lady Egerton to enjoy it without being disturbed. Later in the 20th century, Maurice Egerton built the African Hut to the east of the Broad Walk as an association with his visits to Africa. He also planted large numbers of azaleas and rhododendrons. By the end of the 20th century, the Japanese Garden had become overgrown and it was restored in 2001. Since then the kitchen garden has been restored and the head gardener is planning to construct a new garden to reflect garden design in the 20th and 21st centuries. ==Layout== Pond at Tatton Park The present garden entrance leads from the stable yard into the Walled Garden. On top of the north-facing wall are objects which look like urns, but which are actually chimney pots for what was once a heated wall. The ancillary buildings, including the mushroom sheds, onion stores, barns and glasshouses, have been restored to their former uses. The vegetable garden contains varieties of plants which were known to have been grown at Tatton in the Edwardian era. Some of the fruit in the garden was also grown during that time, while other varieties of fruit had been grown elsewhere in Cheshire. The glasshouses contain a representation of what would have been originally grown in them, including a restored pinery vinery for growing pineapples. The Walled Garden leads into the \\"Pleasure Gardens\\", which were for enjoyment rather than utility. These contain the L Borders which include plants formally arranged to replicate the style of border developed by Gertrude Jekyll. To the south of the L Borders is Charlotte's Garden. This was designed as a Gardenesque type of garden, including a conservatory, an arbour, a fountain, a rockery and a snake path. These five elements can still be found in this garden. The L Border, the Broad Walk and Beech Avenue form the main path through the gardens to the south which lead to the Monument. Opposite Charlotte's Garden is the Topiary which leads to the Rose Garden. This garden contains artefacts, including a Tea House, many of which were taken from the estate of Rostherne Manor. To the south of the Rose Garden is the Tower Garden, which contains a brick tower whose original purpose was to watch for sheep-stealing on the park land. This garden also contains articles from Rostherne Manor. Along the western border of the garden is the Arboretum, which contains 880 plants in 281 species. Its important trees include a Giant Redwood, a Weymouth Pine, a Mexican White Pine, an Ernest's Fir, and a Chilean Incense Cedar. Japanese Garden in the Anglo-Japanese style The Japanese Garden is to the west of the southern end of the Broad Walk and is considered to be the finest Japanese garden in the United Kingdom, if not in Europe. It is an example of the Anglo- Japanese style.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/step-into-a-rarity-an-anglo- japanese-garden-that-works-5gdvsq8wcwb Artefacts in the garden include a Shinto Shrine, a tea house, a bridge over the Golden Brook, and a number of lanterns. The garden contains plants, stones and rocks which have been placed to provide a natural balance. The stones and rocks are selected for their shapes, and a mound has been formed to replicate Mount Fuji with its snow- capped summit.https://www.tattonpark.org.uk/what_to_see_and_do/gardens/garden_areas/japanese_garden.aspx The plants include specimens of Japanese maple and various mosses. To the east of the Broad Walk is Maurice Egerton's African Hut. To the north of this is the Maze, which is planted with hornbeam and beech. To the southeast of Tatton Hall is the Italian Garden, a formal garden on two terraces. Its centrepiece is the statue of Neptune, which is unusual in that its pipework is visible at the back. To the south of the east end of the family wing are the Conservatory, the Fernery, and the Showhouse. ==Present day== The gardens are owned by the National Trust and administered by Cheshire East Council. They are open to the public at advertised times. The Fernery still contains tree ferns and the Showhouse has changing displays of flowering plants. Produce from the Walled Garden can be purchased in the garden shop. A group of volunteers work to maintain the gardens. Courses are held on various aspects of gardening. ==References== Bibliography * * ==External links== *https://www.tattonpark.org.uk/what_to_see_and_do/gardens/gardens.aspx Category:Gardens in Cheshire Category:Tourist attractions in Cheshire Category:National Trust properties in Cheshire Category:Japanese gardens in England ","title":"Tatton Park Gardens"},{"id":"20461750","text":"The Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy Series is one of the annual Directors Guild of America Awards given by the Directors Guild of America.

Gardner, known to many in the modern sense as the \\"Father of Wicca\\", based the book around his experiences with the religion of Wicca and the New Forest Coven. It was first published in 1959, only after the British Parliament repealed the Witchcraft Act of 1735, and proved to be Gardner's final book. The Wicca religion as expounded by Gardner was focused on a goddess, identified with the night sky and with wild nature, and a horned god who represented the fertilizing powers of the natural world. It was organized into covens, through which members were initiated through three ascending degrees of competence and authority and which were governed by a high priestess, supported by a high priest. More historical context to the pagan practice of Wicca can be found in the book Wicca: History, Belief, and Community in Modern Pagan Witchcraft That book discusses Wiccan life, covering how and why people convert to Wicca; its denominations; its sociological demographics; its political beliefs, particularly in terms of environmentalist issues; the impact of anti-Wiccan persecution; the transmission of Wiccan and Pagan culture; and the history of academic analysis of Wicca. The Meaning of Witchcraft is a sequel to Gardner's previous book on the subject, Witchcraft Today, which was published in 1954. Chapters include: Witch's Memories and Beliefs, The Stone Age Origins of Witchcraft, Druidism and the Aryan Celts, Magic Thinking, Curious Beliefs about Witches, Signs and Symbols, The Black Mass, Some Allegations Examined. When Gardner died in 1964, the copyright for the book was left to the High Priestess of his coven, Monique Wilson. Gardner wrote the book in order to publicise Wicca, which he believed would die out unless more converts could be attracted. Gardner himself believed that Wicca was the survival of an ancient pagan Witch-cult, a theory originating from historian Margaret Murray which has now largely been discredited by historians like Ronald Hutton and Jeffrey Russell. Margaret Murray's theory maintained that witches were indeed members of an organized cult surviving from pagan times. According to Murray, Christianity remained a thin veneer which cloaked pagan customs down to the sixteenth century. Hutton does say that all the modern branches of Wicca are either based on or influenced by his (Gardner) teachings. It is the only complete religion (as opposed to sect or denomination) which England has ever given the world. ==NotesExternal links== *Page with the original text for the book Category:1959 non-fiction books Category:Wiccan books Category:Works by Gerald Gardner ","title":"The Meaning of Witchcraft"},{"id":"20461791","text":"The decision of the Parliament of Scotland to ratify the Treaty of Union in 1707 was not unanimous and, from that time, individuals and organisations have advocated the reinstatement of a Scottish Parliament. Some have argued for devolution ‚Äì a Scottish Parliament within the United Kingdom ‚Äì while others have advocated complete independence. The people of Scotland first got the opportunity to vote in a referendum on proposals for devolution in 1979 and, although a majority of those voting voted 'Yes', the referendum legislation also required 40% of the electorate to vote 'Yes' for the plans to be enacted and this was not achieved. A second referendum opportunity in 1997, this time on a strong proposal, resulted in an overwhelming 'Yes' victory, leading to the Scotland Act 1998 being passed and the Scottish Parliament being established in 1999. Scottish voters were given the chance to vote 'Yes' on outright independence in a 2014 referendum. In an effort to persuade Scots to remain in the Union, the major UK parties vowed to devolve further powers to Scotland after the referendum. The 'No' vote prevailed (independence was rejected), but the campaign promise of devolution resulted in the formation of the Smith Commission and the eventual passage of the Scotland Act 2016. == 1707 to 1999 == Having agreed to pass the Union with England Act, the Parliament of Scotland 'adjourned' on 25 March 1707. The new united Kingdom of Great BritainWelcome parliament.uk, accessed 7 October 2008Act of Union 1707, Article 2. came into being on 1 May 1707, with a single parliament of Great Britain which in effect was the Parliament of England with the addition of Scottish representation. The post of Secretary of State for Scotland existed after 1707 until the Jacobite rising of 1745. Thereafter, responsibility for Scotland lay primarily with the office of the Secretary of State for the Northern Department, usually exercised by the Lord Advocate. The Secretaries of State were reorganised in 1782 and the duties now came under the Secretary of State for the Home Department. === Administrative devolution (1885) === 1885 saw the creation of the Scottish Office and the post of Secretary for Scotland. From 1892 the Secretary for Scotland sat in cabinet, but the position was not officially recognised as a full member of the cabinet of the United Kingdom until the Secretary for Scotland post was upgraded to full Secretary of State rank as Secretary of State for Scotland in 1926. === Government of Scotland Bill 1913 === In May 1913 the House of Commons passed the second reading of the Government of Scotland Bill 1913 (also referred to as the Scottish Home Rule Bill) by 204 votes to 159. The bill was supported by Liberals and opposed by Unionists. It did not proceed further due to the outbreak of the First World War. === Scottish Covenant Association (1940s and 1950s) === The Scottish Covenant Association was a non-partisan political organisation that sought the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly. It was formed by John MacCormick who had left the Scottish National Party in 1942 when they decided to support all-out independence for Scotland rather than devolution as had been their position. The Association was responsible for the creation of the Scottish Covenant, which gathered two million signatures in support of devolution. Members of the organisation were also responsible for the removal of the Stone of Destiny from Westminster Abbey in 1950 that attracted huge publicity for the cause of Scottish home rule. === Kilbrandon Report (1973) = 1979 devolution referendum === The Scottish referendum of 1979 was a post-legislative referendum to decide whether there was sufficient support for the Scotland Act 1978 that was to create a deliberative assembly for Scotland. The Act required that for the Act not to be repealed at least 40% of the electorate would have to vote Yes in the referendum. The referendum resulted in a narrow Yes majority but fell short of the 40% requirement. === 1997 devolution referendum === The Scottish devolution referendum of 1997 was a pre-legislative referendum over whether there was support for the creation of a Scottish Parliament within the United Kingdom and whether there was support for such a parliament to have tax varying powers. In response to the clear majority voting for both proposals, the United Kingdom Parliament passed the Scotland Act 1998, creating the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Executive. === The Scotland Act 1998 === The Act was introduced by the Labour government in 1998 after the 1997 referendum. It created the Scottish Parliament, setting out how Members of the Scottish Parliament are to be elected,Sections 1 to 18. making some provision about the internal operation of the Parliament Sections 19 to 27, 39 to 43. (although many issues are left for the Parliament itself to regulate) and setting out the process for the Parliament to consider and pass Bills which become Acts of the Scottish Parliament once they receive Royal Assent.Sections 28 to 36. The Act specifically asserts the continued power of the UK Parliament to legislate in respect of Scotland.Section 28(7). The Act devolves all powers except over matter it specifies as reserved matters.Schedule 5. It further designates a list of statutes which are not amenable to amendment or repeal by the ParliamentSchedule 4 which includes the Human Rights Act 1998 and many provisions of the Scotland Act itself. Even when acting within its legislative competence, the Act further constrains the powers of the Parliament by inhibiting it from acting in a manner incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights or European Community law.Section 29(2)(d). The same constraints apply to acts of the Scottish Executive.Section 57(2). == Scottish Parliament established, May 1999 == The new Scottish Parliament Building at Holyrood designed by the Spanish architect Enric Miralles and opened in October 2004. The Scottish Parliament met for the first time on 12 May 1999 and began its first session with SNP member Winnie Ewing stating \\"the Scottish Parliament, adjourned on 25th day of March in the year 1707, is hereby reconvened\\" === Opening of new Scottish Parliament building (2004) === Construction of the Scottish Parliament building began in June 1999 and the first debate in the new building was held on Tuesday 7 September 2004. The formal opening by the Queen took place on 9 October 2004. Enric Miralles, the Spanish architect who designed the building, died before its completion. From 1999 until the opening of the new building in 2004, committee rooms and the debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament were housed in the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland located on The Mound in Edinburgh. Office and administrative accommodation in support of the Parliament were provided in buildings leased from the City of Edinburgh Council. The new Scottish Parliament Building brought together these different elements into one purpose built parliamentary complex, housing 129 MSPs and more than 1,000 staff and civil servants. The building aims to conceive a poetic union between the Scottish landscape, its people, its culture and the city of Edinburgh, an approach that won the parliament building numerous awards including the 2005 Stirling Prize, and it has been described as \\"a tour de force of arts and crafts and quality without parallel in the last 100 years of British architecture\\". === Powers over Scottish railways transferred (2005) === As a result of provisions in the Railways Bill, powers were transferred from the Department of Transport to the Scottish Executive, a move described by then First Minister, Jack McConnell as \\"...the most significant devolution of new powers to Scottish ministers since 1999.\\"Executive in ¬£325m rail takeover BBC News, 18 January 2005 === Scottish Executive becomes Scottish Government (2007) === A Scottish Executive was created under section 44 of the Scotland Act 1998. Following the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the Scottish Executive was rebranded as the Scottish Government by the new Scottish National Party administration.Scottish Executive renames itself, BBC News, 3 September 2007. Other changes that took place at this time included the development of the National Performance Framework and major restructuring whereby Directors-General were put in charge of the achievement of the Government's strategic objectives. These changes have been described as developing a form of strategic state. The Scottish Executive was legally renamed to the Scottish Government in the Scotland Act 2012. === Calman Commission (2007) === The Calman Commission was established by a motion passed by the Scottish Parliament on 6 December 2007.The Scottish Parliament - Official Report Its terms of reference are: \\"To review the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998 in the light of experience and to recommend any changes to the present constitutional arrangements that would enable the Scottish Parliament to better serve the people of Scotland, that would improve the financial accountability of the Scottish Parliament and that would continue to secure the position of Scotland within the United Kingdom.\\" However, concerns have been expressed that its final report will not have \\"much legitimacy\\" because it was skewed towards preserving the status quo.Calman evidence 'was tampered with' Scotland on Sunday, 30 November 2008 === Powers transferred over planning and nature conservation matters at sea (2008) === During 2008, agreement was reached to transfer responsibility for all planning and nature conservation matters at sea up to 200 miles from the Scottish coast to the Scottish Government. The change has implications for the offshore industry, wind and wave power and to a lesser extent, fishing, though responsibility for fishing quotas remains a European Union issue and oil and gas licensing and permitting remains a reserved matter.Scotland handed sea planning role BBC News, 27 November 2008 === Independence Referendum === In August 2009 the SNP announced a Referendum Bill would be included in its package of bills to be debated before Parliament in 2009‚Äì10, with the intention of holding a referendum on the issues of Scottish independence in November 2010. The bill did not pass due to the SNP's status as a minority administration, and due to the initial opposition to the Bill from all other major parties in the Scottish Parliament. Following the 2011 Scottish Parliament election the SNP had a majority in parliament and again brought forward an Independence Referendum Bill. The Scottish Government also suggested that full fiscal autonomy for Scotland (known as \\"devo-max\\") could be an alternative option in the vote. The negotiation of the Edinburgh Agreement (2012) resulted in the UK government legislating to provide the Scottish Parliament with the powers to hold the referendum. The \\"devo-max\\" option was not included, however, as the Edinburgh Agreement stipulated that the referendum had to be a clear binary choice between independence or the existing devolution arrangements. The Scottish Independence Referendum (Franchise) Act 2013 was passed by the Scottish Parliament and campaigning commenced. Two days before the referendum was held, with polls very close, the leaders of the three main UK political parties made \\"The Vow\\", a public pledge to devolve \\"extensive new powers\\" to the Scottish Parliament if independence was rejected. They also agreed to a devolution timetable proposed by Gordon Brown. After heavy campaigning by both sides, voting took place on 18 September 2014. Independence was rejected by a margin of 45% in favour to 55% against. === Smith Commission === The day after the referendum, David Cameron announced the formation of the Smith Commission to \\"convene cross-party talks\\" concerning \\"recommendations for further devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament\\". Two months later, on 27 November 2014, the commission published its recommendations, which included giving the Scottish Parliament complete power to set income tax rates and bands, increased borrowing powers, and an extensive list of other rights and powers. === Scotland Act 2016 === Based on the Smith Commission's recommendations, the Scotland Act 2016 was passed by Parliament and received Royal Assent on 23 March 2016. The Act set out amendments to the Scotland Act 1998 and devolved further powers to Scotland, most notably: * The ability to amend sections of the Scotland Act 1998 which relate to the operation of the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government within the United Kingdom including control of its electoral system (subject to a two-thirds majority within the parliament for any proposed change) * Legislative control over areas such as onshore oil and gas extraction, rail franchising, consumer advocacy and advice amongst others by devolution of powers in relation to these fields to the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Ministers. * Management of the Crown Estate and the British Transport Police in Scotland * Control over certain and removable taxes including Air Passenger Duty * Full control over Scottish income tax including Income Tax rates and bands on non- savings and non-dividend income The Act recognised the Scottish Parliament and a Scottish Government as permanent among UK's constitutional arrangements, with a referendum required before either can be abolished. == See also == * Scottish Social Attitudes Survey * Scottish Constitutional Convention * Scottish Constitutional Commission * Constitutional status of Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles * Devolution in the United Kingdom == Further reading == * *Uncharted Territory: The Story of Scottish Devolution 1999‚Äì2009 by Hamish Macdonell (2009) *The Scottish Political System Since Devolution: From New Politics to the New Scottish Government by Paul Cairney (2011) * N.

It was completed in 1929 as the 350-room Thomas Jefferson Hotel and is at 1623 2nd Avenue North. It has a tower in its roof intended to be a zeppelin mooring mast. ==History== The Thomas Jefferson Hotel was planned and developed by the Union Realty Company, headed by Henry Cobb. The company was organized in November 1925 in the office of architect David O. Whilldin, who prepared the design for the $1.5 million project. The Foster-Creighton Company of Nashville, Tennessee was selected as contractor and work began on the site in May 1926. Progress was halted in April 1927 when one of the projects financiers, the Adair Realty and Trust Company of Atlanta, Georgia failed. A new holding company was formed and work resumed in July 1928. Costs reached $2.5 million before it opened on September 7, 1929. The hotel's opening week featured nightly banquets and dances featuring an orchestra from New York. It was originally called The Thomas Jefferson Hotel, then the Cabana Hotel, the Leer Tower, and finally the Thomas Jefferson Tower. === Design === The hotel featured an ornate marble lobby, a large ballroom, and a rooftop mooring mast intended for use by dirigibles. The ground floor incorporated space for six shops and the basement included a billiard room and barber shop. The ballroom and dining rooms on the second floor opened out onto roof terraces from which the main tower rose. A Corinthian colonnade in glazed white terra-cotta set off the base of the tower, with the hotel entrance marked by a metal canopy. The fourth floor created an entablature, punctuated by the rhythm of windows that continued in brick for 13 more floors. The tower was capped on the top two floors with ornamented terra-cotta, including a balustrade and arched deep-set openings. The corners of the tower were clad in white brick to provide visual supports for the upper portion of the tower, while the narrow strips of brick between the windows were tan in color, each capped with a white acanthus leaf at the top. The edge of each corner was softened with a twisted-rope moulding, rising to a sculpted satyr at the top. The cornice rests on tightly spaced brackets with a shallow overhang of red mission tile suggesting a sloped roof. ===Early years=== A $35,000 improvement project was undertaken in 1933. Some of the retail spaces were subsumed into a larger hotel lobby with an electric fireplace. The dining room was similarly expanded and a banquet room was constructed over part of the roof terrace. It was only the first of several renovations for numerous owners. The Stirrup Cup lounge opened at the hotel on October 4, 1940. Birmingham newspapers declared the 200-room Thomas Jefferson Hotel as one of the finest in the country. Built to host huge gatherings, the $2.5 million facility was stocked with 7,000 pieces of silverware, 5,000 glasses and 4,000 sets of linen. As an affiliate of the National Hotels chain and under the management of Austin Frame, the Thomas Jefferson advertised rooms from $9 to 18 a night and multi-room suites for $18 to 35. All rooms were air conditioned and provided with a private bath, radio, television and Muzak. The hotel operated a laundry and valet service and housed a coffee shop, lounge, pharmacy and barber shop. Nightly dinner dances were held in the Windsor Room. Other rooms available for events included the Terrace Ballroom, Jefferson Room, Green Room, Gold Room, Board Room and Director's Room. \\"Southern charm and hospitality at its happy best, wonderful best. That's the pride of Birmingham The Hotel Thomas Jefferson\\", an early newspaper ad boasted. A large vertically oriented painted sign for the Thomas Jefferson Hotel is still visible on the brick-clad west side of the tower. At one time the letters were outlined with neon tubes, fabricated and installed by Dixie Neon. \\"It had an excellent chef. Among the bellboys, they were especially known for pecan pies\\", a man who was a bellboy in 1943 says with a smile, as if just being offered a piece. \\"Oh man, they were delicious.\\" Its luxury status made the Thomas Jefferson a prime spot for celebrities visiting the city, including Mickey Rooney and Ethel Merman. U.S Presidents Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover and singer Ray Charles have also stayed at the hotel. But most of the guests were businessmen, often salesmen who rented one room for sleeping and another as an office for peddling their inventory. The hotel was a showplace with unparalleled amenities. And when the employees were not carrying luggage and serving guests, they operated a popular side business at the hotel. In the age of Prohibition, clever methods were used to meet the needs of thirsty guests. Bellboys would buy \\"Pensacola rye\\" from the nearby police station to sell to hotel guests. === Cabana Hotel === The 1970s marked a period of decline for the aging luxury hotel, renamed the Cabana Hotel in 1972. A new rooftop sign advertising the hotel was then added, along with a main hotel sign. The original ornate carpets were now replaced with shag carpets, and dropped ceilings were added. The economy had slowed, and a shift of attention to the northern end of town left older hotels, such as the Cabana, struggling. The scene was typical nationwide, as corporate mergers and new projects prompted the closing of many old buildings. During its peak, the Cabana hosted Mickey Rooney and Ethel Merman during visits to Birmingham. A special suite was reserved for Bear Bryant during games at Legion Field. In Birmingham, the Cabana was the last of the perennial hotels to fade away following the demise of the original Tutwiler Hotel in 1974, and the Bankhead Hotel conversion into senior housing. Its demise was also quickened by the opening of the BJCC complex to the north, taking all of its business to the Hyatt House Birmingham Hotel (now Sheraton Birmingham) and the Holiday Inn Civic Center (now gone) as well. It was a slow death that stripped it of most of its former glory. The hotel had suffered two major fires during this period of decline: one large one in 1980 and a smaller one in 1981. By 1981, the Cabana was a second-rate, $200-a-month apartment building with fewer than 100 residents. The hotel was shut down on May 31, 1983, by city health officials after it was declared uninhabitable on account of \\"bad plumbing, insufficient lighting, some inoperative smoke detectors and failure to upgrade to city fire codes\\". === Leer Tower === In 2005 the Leer Corporation of Modesto, California, announced a $20 million proposal to convert the building into upscale condominiums, to be known as the Leer Tower. That proposal was delayed by a dispute over control of the building and the owner's inability to secure local financing. The property went into foreclosure in July 2008. Subsequently the property had fallen further into disrepair, with the basement flooded with water and vagrants squatting in the upper floors. === Non-Profit seeks to renovate === In 2012, it was reported that a nonprofit corporation, Thomas Jefferson Tower Inc., was raising funds to buy the building and renovate it into a hotel, possibly as part of a mixed-use development including retail, a grocery store, and apartments.http://www.bizjournals.com/birmingham/news/2012/07/13/nonprofit- wants-to-buy-and-renovate.html These efforts would ultimately prove unsuccessful. ===Thomas Jefferson Tower=== In August 2013, the building and its annex were acquired by TJTower LLC, a group of investors from Little Rock, Arkansas and New Orleans including former professional basketball player Brian Beshara. The former hotel was one of the first projects in Alabama to utilize new state and federal tax credits designed to spur redevelopment of historic structures. Pre-construction plans called for mixed-use conversion into 100 apartments, ground floor restaurant and retail space, and event/entertainment space in the former dining room and ballroom. It is one of multiple revitalization projects occurring in downtown Birmingham, along with the renovation of the long-closed Lyric Theater and the nearby Pizitz Building. Construction began on February 12, 2015. As of May 2015, the \\"Leer Tower\\" signage as well as the ground floor siding had been removed. On August 6, 2016, the top portion of the rooftop mooring mast was replaced, and the structure returned to its original appearance. The structure features LED lighting that can be remotely changed in color and intensity to mark specific occasions, much like is done at the Empire State Building in New York. It reopened in 2017. It became one of America's Prime attractions from Alabama. == References  External links == * http://www.bizjournals.com/birmingham/news/2012/07/13/nonprofit-wants-to-buy- and-renovate.html * http://bhamwiki.com/w/Thomas_Jefferson_Hotel * http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=cabanahotel-birmingham-al-usa * http://tjtower.com * http://www.al.com/business/index.ssf/2013/10/100_apartments_restaurant_and.html * http://www.al.com/business/index.ssf/2013/08/former_lsu_basketball_star_bri.html Category:Skyscraper hotels in Birmingham, Alabama Category:Neoclassical architecture in Alabama Category:Hotels established in 1929 Category:1929 establishments in Alabama Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1929 ","title":"Thomas Jefferson Hotel"},{"id":"20461813","text":"is a former Japanese football player. ==Playing career== Watanabe was born in Iwaki on March 15, 1982.

The effect of French weapons was especially significant in field artillery and infantry. These weapons were either American productions based on French designs, or sometimes directly imported from France. ==Field artillery== Canon obusier de campagne de 12 mod√®le 1853\\", on display in Les Invalides The canon obusier de 12, introduced in the French Army in 1853, an early type of canon obusier, or gun howitzer developed during the reign of Napoleon III, was the primary cannon used in the American Civil War, under the name of 12-pounder Napoleon Model 1857.The Mitrailleuse by Dr. Patrick Marder Military History Online Over 1,100 such Napoleons were manufactured by the North, and 600 by the South. An American M1857 12-Pounder \\"Napoleon\\" The twelve-pound cannon \\"Napoleon\\" was the most popular smoothbore cannon used during the war. It was widely admired because of its safety, reliability, and killing power, especially at close range. It did not reach America until 1857. It was the last cast bronze gun used by an American army. The Federal version of the Napoleon can be recognized by the flared front end of the barrel, called the muzzle swell. Confederate Napoleons were produced in at least six variations, most of which had straight muzzles, but at least eight cataloged survivors of 133 identified have muzzle swells. Additionally, four iron Confederate Napoleons produced by Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, Virginia have been identified, of an estimated 125 cast. ==Firearms== Training with the Mini√© rifle during the American Civil War, 1863. The caption reads: \\"Teaching negro recruits the use of the Mini√© rifle\\". The Mini√© rifle caused huge wounds with its large sized bullets. The Mini√© rifle and Mini√© ball comprised the most widely used firearms system of the American Civil War. The Mini√© system was used extensively by various manufacturers, such as Springfield. The Springfield Model 1861 was most widely used rifle of the American Civil War. The LeMat revolver, designed by Jean Alexandre LeMat of New Orleans and manufactured in France and Belgium. ==Submarines== Alligator, first submarine of the US Navy, was developed in conjunction with the French. During the American Civil War, the Union-built and French-designed submarine Alligator was the first U.S. Navy submarine and the first to feature compressed air (for air supply) and an air filtration system. Initially hand-powered by oars, it was converted after 6 months to a screw propeller powered by a hand crank. With a crew of 20, it was larger than Confederate submarines. Alligator was 47 feet (14.3 m) long and about 4 feet (1.2 m) in diameter. The submarine was lost in a storm off Cape Hatteras on April 1, 1863 with no crew and under tow to its first combat deployment at Charleston. ==Ironclads== Stonewall was later renamed K≈çtetsu. As the Confederacy struggled against the North, it attempted to purchase one of the latest ironclads from France, Stonewall (later acquired by Japan after the end of the war). The ship, built in Bordeaux, France by the L'Arman shipyard in 1864, was an ironclad ram warship. However, the French government embargoed the sale of the ship to the Confederacy in February 1864 (prior to her launch in June 1864), and then sold the ship to the Royal Danish Navy as St√¶rkodder. However, L'Arman and the Danish Navy could not agree on a price for the ship,Southern Historical Society Papers, Volume VII, Number 6. Richmond, Virginia: 1879. Pages 263‚Äì280. and sometime shortly after January 7, 1865 the vessel took on a Confederate crew and was commissioned CSS Stonewall while still at sea; L'Arman had secretly resold her to the Confederacy.Steensen, Robert Steen. Vore Panserskibe [Our Armoured Vessels]. Marinehistorisk Selskab, Copenhagen, Denmark: 1968. Pages 178-195. Steensen was a former Commander in the Royal Danish Navy. An English translation by S√∏ren N√∏rby may be found at The arrival of the \\"formidable\\" Stonewall in America was dreaded by the Union, and several ships tried to intercept her, among them and . In February and March, and laid up at Ferrol, Spain, to prevent Stonewall from departing, but the much more powerful Confederate ship was able to make good her escape. After an eventful crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, she eventually arrived in North American waters near the end of the American Civil War, too late to have a significant effect. (By the time of her October 1864 commissioning the Confederacy was in disarray and near defeat, its navy disintegrating, along with most other Confederate institutions.) To avoid surrendering the vessel, Captain Page sailed her into Havana harbor and turned her over to the Captain General of Cuba for the sum of $16,000. The vessel was then turned over to United States authorities in return for reimbursement of the same amount.Letter from William H. Seward to Gideon Wells, July 18, 1865.

Wilder Howlett was commissioned by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to photograph the frescoes in the new drawing-room at Buckingham Palace, make copies of the paintings by Raphael and make a series of portraits called 'Crimean Heroes' which was exhibited in 1857 the Photographic Society of London's annual exhibition. Howlett died in 1858, aged 27. His death was apparently due to typhoid (rather than as a result of over-exposure to dangerous chemicals, as was suggested by some at the time, a myth that has continued to this day). The Illustrated Times praised him as \\"one of the most skillful photographers of the day\\". Prints from Howlett's photographs were published posthumously by his late partners Cundall & Downes under their own name, and by the London Stereoscopic and Photographic Company. ==Early life and education== Isambard Kingdom Brunel Standing Before the Launching Chains of the Great Eastern by Robert Howlett (1857) Robert Howlett was the second of four sons of Reverend Robert Howlett and Harriet Harsant. Two brothers died in infancy and his younger brother Thomas became a farmer. He was born in Theberton, Suffolk and the family had moved to Longham, Norfolk by the time he was 9 years old. His maternal grandfather, Thomas Harsant, a surgeon, constructed telescopes, microscopes, electrical machines, implements and instruments. Robert built his own microscope when a child. Thomas Harsant died in 1852 and left him ¬£1000 plus his \\"turning lathe and all the apparatus and tools belonging thereto\\". Thus he was able to move to London. ==Career== In London Howlett rose to prominence while working for the Photographic Institution at 168 New Bond Street, London, which was a leading establishment for the commercial promotion of photography through exhibitions, publications, and commissions. Although the Photographic Institution was established in 1853 by Joseph Cundall and Philip Henry Delamotte, it is believed that Howlett replaced Delamotte, who became professor of drawing at King's College London. He was elected to membership of the Photographic Society of London, later the Royal Photographic Society, in December 1855 and remained a member until his death.Members of the Royal Photographic Society, 1853‚Äì1901. Accessed 26 October 2016 http://rpsmembers.dmu.ac.uk/rps_results.php?mid=805 By 1856 Howlett was mentioned in the photographic press. He sent prints to the annual exhibitions of photographic societies in London, Manchester, and Norwich. These included landscape studies, In the Valley of the River Mole, Mickleham, and Box Hill, Surrey, which are presumed to have been taken in 1855. He exhibited at the London Photographic Society and in 1856 published a booklet \\"On the Various Methods of Printing Photographic Pictures upon Paper, with Suggestions for Their Preservation\\". He also designed and sold 'dark room tents' and worked in partnership with Joseph Cundall at \\"The Photographic Institution\\" at 168 New Bond Street, London. Howlett undertook the first of a number of commissions for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1856, working for the Photographic Institution. These included copying the works of Raphael for Prince Albert, and making a series of portraits of heroic soldiers from the Crimean War. These were first exhibited in 1857 as 'Crimean Heroes' at the Photographic Society of London's annual exhibition.Note: There are 2 discrete sets of 'Crimean Heroes' pictures. One by Howlett and the other by Joseph Cundall In 2004 Cundall and Howlett's portraits of Crimean war veterans, were used by the Royal Mail for a set of six postage stamps to mark the 150th anniversary of the conflict. Howlett's studio portraits at 'The Photographic Institute' included eminent 'fine artists' such as William Powell Frith, Frederick Richard Pickersgill, John Callcott Horsley, and Thomas Webster which were among a larger group exhibited at the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester in 1857. Howlett was commissioned to make photographic studies of the crowd at the 1856 Epsom Derby for the painter William Powell Frith, who used them in 1858 for his painting of The Derby Day which was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Art in 1859. The photographs were taken from the roof of a cab. Great Eastern steamship under construction (1857), photograph by Robert Howlett ==The Great Eastern== Howlett's major work was the commission by the The Illustrated Times Weekly Newspaper to document the construction of the world's largest steamship, the SS Great Eastern. His images were translated into wood-engravings by Henry Vizetelly for the Illustrated Times. They reflected and stimulated the widespread interest in this feat of engineering. This project included the well-known portrait of the Great Eastern's creator and engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, standing in front of the giant launching chains on the 'checking drum' braking mechanism at John Scott Russell's Millwall shipyard. It was taken to celebrate the launch of the world's largest steamship, in November 1857.Icons, Profile of Robert Howlett This image, which depicts Brunel in an industrial setting instead of a more traditional background for a portrait, has been described as \\"one of the first examples of environmental portraiture\\". Victoria and Albert Museum, Review of works by Robert Howlett ==Death== Howlett died in 1858, aged 27, at his home and studio at 10 Bedford Place, Campden Hill, shortly after returning from a trip to France to try out a new 'wide angle lens'. The cause of death was apparently due to typhoid, rather than (as suggested by some at the time) to over-exposure to the chemicals used in the Collodion photographic process invented by Frederick Scott Archer in about 1850. The Illustrated Times praised him as \\"one of the most skillful photographers of the day\\". The death certificate simply states febris (fever), 20 days. Howlett had originally told his friend Thomas Frederick Hardwich that he had a cold. ===Grave=== Howlett is buried at the church of St Peter and St Paul, Wendling, Norfolk, where his father was perpetual curate.

JDTic is a 4-phenylpiperidine derivative, distantly related structurally to analgesics such as pethidine and ketobemidone, and more closely to the MOR antagonist alvimopan. In addition, it is structurally distinct from other KOR antagonists such as norbinaltorphimine. ==Pharmacology== JDTic is a long-acting (\\"inactivating\\") antagonist of the KOR, and is highly selective for the KOR over the Œº-opioid receptor (MOR), Œ¥-opioid receptor (DOR), and nociceptin receptor (NOP). It has a very long duration of action, with effects in animals seen for up to several weeks after administration of a single dose, although its binding to the KOR is not technically \\"irreversible\\" and its long-acting effects are instead caused by altered activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinases. Animal studies suggest that JDTic may produce antidepressant, anxiolytic, and anti-stress effects, as well as having possible application in the treatment of addiction to cocaine and morphine. JDTic shows robust activity in animal models of depression, anxiety, stress-induced cocaine relapse, and nicotine withdrawal. The high affinity of JDTic for the KOR suggested that it might be a suitable ligand for promoting the crystallization of this receptor for X-ray crystallographic studies. Such experiments were successful and lead to the publication of the first report of a high-resolution structure of an opioid receptor [ ]. ==Discontinuation== During phase I human clinical trials for the treatment of cocaine abuse, development of JDTic was halted due to the incidence of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, a type of arrhythmia that can potentially be life- threatening. In addition, JDTic showed an unfavorable brain-to-plasma concentration ratio, indicating poor central nervous system penetration. As a result, new KOR antagonists with more favorable drug profiles (e.g., short- acting, improved brain penetration, etc.), such as ALKS-5461 (a combination of buprenorphine and samidorphan) and CERC-501 (formerly LY-2456302), are being developed instead. The discontinuation of the clinical development of JDTic is detailed in the following important literature quote: In the same paper, LY-2456302 (now CERC-501) was described, \\"The LY2456302 compound developed by Eli Lilly is an example of a KOR antagonist that does not strongly activate JNK. In a recent phase 1 trial of LY2456302, the authors concluded that the drug was well-tolerated with no clinically significant findings (Lowe et al, 2014).\\" Note that KOR antagonists that strongly activate JNK are inactivating (long-acting) while those that do not are non-inactivating (short-acting), and that inactivating KOR antagonists are more \\"complete\\" and hence potentially more risky inhibitors of the KOR than are non-inactivating antagonists. ==See also== * Œ∫-Opioid receptor ¬ß Antagonists * List of investigational antidepressants ==References== Category:Carboxamides Category:Irreversible receptor antagonists Category:Kappa antagonists Category:Opioid antagonists Category:Phenols Category:Piperidines Category:Synthetic opioids Category:Tetrahydroisoquinolines ","title":"JDTic"},{"id":"20461972","text":"John Creighton and his father's Plaque, St. John's Anglican Church (Lunenburg), Nova Scotia John Creighton (1794 ‚Äì March 16, 1878) was an English-born lawyer and political figure in Nova Scotia.

During the trip he had several times been employed as secretary to Commissioner-General Hendrik van Rheede, which enabled him to make quick progress in his career with the Dutch East India Company (VOC). In 1686 he became Bookkeeper (boekhouder) and subsequently Underbuyer (onderkoopman). In 1694, he was promoted to Buyer (koopman) and in 1694 to Senior Buyer (opperkoopman). In the same year he was appointed Commander (commandeur) in Jafnapatham in Ceylon. He was Commissioner (commissaris) on the Malabar Coast and acting Governor of Ceylon in 1697. He became, in 1703, Secretary to the High Government of the Indies (Hoge Regering) in Batavia, and in 1704, through the influence of the Governor-General, Joan van Hoorn, an extraordinary member of the Dutch Council of the Indies (Raad van de Indi√´). Through that membership, and later because the Governor-General Christoffel van Swoll had been trying to get him removed from the council, preferably by promotion elsewhere, it took until 1715 before the Lords Seventeen (Heren XVII) named him as full member (gewoon lid). ==Governor-general of the Dutch East Indies== The day after the death of Christoffel van Swoll, on 12 November 1718, Zwaardecroon was named Governor- General. Only on 10 September 1720, was he confirmed in this post. His dismissal, by his own desire, came on 16 October 1724, though he handed the actual office to Mattheus de Haan only on 8 July 1725. During his term of office, Zwaardecroon had to deal with a lot of unrest in Batavia, including arson in the dockyards and an attack on the gunpowder stores. The wealthy Pieter Eberveld, had inherited some land from his father. The government laid claim to a part of this estate. Eberveld planned an attack on the Dutchmen but some of his slaves warned the government and the attack was thwarted. He confessed on the rack and was condemned to death, along with other plotters. His house was destroyed and a wall erected around where it had stood. His head was stuck on a lance and attached to the wall. A stone with an inscription was erected, indicating that never again would anything be built on that spot. It was only removed during the Japanese occupation (World War II). Zwaardecrood always took great interest in developing new products. He encouraged coffee- planting in Priangan on Java meaning coffee production grew quickly. From 1723 on, the whole of the harvest had to be delivered to the Company. Zwaardecroon then introduced silk production to Java as well as the production of vegetable dyes. The silk production was not very successful. In 1772 he re-established the Chinese tea trade, which was previously been disrupted. In 1719, Pakubuwono I of Kartasura in East Java died and was succeeded by his son, Amangkurat IV. Two of his brothers did not recognise his succession and rose in revolt, attacking Kartasura. This was repulsed by the Dutch occupying troops, but Zwaardecroon felt himself compelled to send more troops to East Java. The revolt was put down by 1723, but it took until 1752 until real peace was restored in the area. (Second Javanese War of Succession 1719 - 1723). Zwaardecroon took action against private traders, and thus got better relations with local Company top shareholders (Bewindhouders). In 1726, he had 26 Company servants brought to Batavia on charges of corruption. His grave Zwaardecroon died on 12 August 1728 in his estate at Kaduang near Batavia. He said he felt more at home with ordinary townsfolk, and so at his request he was not buried with his predecessors as Governor-General, but in the graveyard of the Portuguese Church Outside the Walls at Batavia (Portuguese Buitenkerk) in Batavia, where his grave can still be visited. == References == * Site in Dutch on the Dutch East India Company (VOC) * Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch- Indi√´, Part Soek-Zij. * Putten, L.P. van, 2002. - Ambitie en onvermogen : gouverneurs-generaal van Nederlands-Indi√´ 1610-1796. * www.bezuidenhout.nl (in Dutch) ==External links== * * Category:1667 births Category:1728 deaths Category:Governors-General of the Dutch East Indies Category:People from Rotterdam ","title":"Hendrick Zwaardecroon"},{"id":"20462108","text":"Suzanne Allday-Goodison (26 November 1934 - 26 July 2017) was an English female discus thrower and shot putter.

The spelling St Breoke was also formerly in use. ==Geography== St Breock village is 1 mile (1.6 km) west of Wadebridge immediately to the south of the Royal Cornwall Showground. The village lies on the eastern slope of the wooded Nansent valley. The civil parish of St Breock is in Bodmin Registration District and the population in the 2001 census was 703, increasing to 725 at the 2011 census. The parish extends approx five miles (8 kilometres) south of Wadebridge. To the north, the parish is bounded by the River Camel, to the west by St Issey parish, to the northeast by Egloshayle parish and to the southeast by Lanivet parish. Together with Egloshayle it was one of the two parishes within which the town of Wadebridge developed. ==Prehistory== St Breock Downs Monolith Around two miles south of the village stands the St Breock Downs Monolith, a 16 ft (5 m) high prehistoric standing stone. It is the largest and heaviest prehistoric standing stone in Cornwall.St Breock Downs Monolith, English Heritage, retrieved 12 April 2012 Around one mile northwest of the monolith is a prehistoric dolmen known as Pawton Quoit. ==Manor of Pawton== The Manor of Pawton, already established in Saxon times, was very large, extending to six whole parishes and parts of four others. It was granted to the Bishops of Sherborne by King Egbert of Wessex and held by their successors until it was alienated under Henry VIII. In 1086 there were 44 hides of land, land for 60 ploughs, 40 villagers and 40 smallholders; pasture 12 sq leagues, woodland 2 sq leagues. Charles G. Henderson wrote in 1925 that slight remains of the bishop's palace and deer park were still to be seen.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 64-65 On the down above Pawton is a very large barrow with massive dolmen.

Penguin BooksThorn, C., et al. (eds.) (1979) Cornwall. Chichester: Phillimore; sec. 2,4 Text and translation of Domesday account of Pawton ==Parish Church== The parish church is dedicated to St Briocus and dates back to the 13th century although it was extensively rebuilt in 1677. (The aisle, south transept and porches are additions of the 15th and 16th centuries.) The church has a battlemented tower with a ring of five bells. It is situated beside the stream in the valley bottom and in 1965 suffered damage in a major flood. The nave is longer than usual in a parish church: this may be connected to the fact that the Bishops of Exeter owned the manor of Pawton before the Reformation and had a palace there. In 1790 the rector here was John Molesworth and his wife Catherine Molesworth was an amateur artist.F. M. O'Donoghue, ‚ÄòMolesworth [St Aubyn], Catherine (1760‚Äì1836)‚Äô, rev. Annette Peach, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 30 March 2015 The church was restored for ¬£1,400, and reopened on 26 July 1881 by Edward Benson, the Bishop of Truro. The church contains some fine monuments to members of the Tredeneck family and one of 1598 to William and Jane Viell. The heirs of the Viell family in the 17th century were the Prideaux family of Prideaux Place, which still owned the manor of St Breock in 1968.Delderfield, Eric R., West Country Historic Houses and their Families, Newton Abbot, 1968, p. 124 There is a brass probably also to a Tredeneck, ca. 1520.Dunkin, E.

He served as the police commissioner for the New York Police Department, U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of New York, the Collector of the Port of New York and was the Republican candidate who ran against Hugh J. Grant for the Mayor of New York in 1888. ==Early life== Joel Benedict Erhardt was born in Pottstown, Pennsylvania and moved with his parents, John Erhardt and Louisa Benedict, to New York City at the age of three. He came from a poor background, it being necessary for him to work in order to pay for the costs of public schooling, and was employed as messenger and clerk. Erhardt continued to work his way through college, becoming a schoolteacher in Upper Jay, New York, attending the University of Vermont. He continued his studies up until the start of the American Civil War whereupon he volunteered to enlist in the Union Army. He initially joined the Ninth Militia Regiment, but reportedly anxious for active duty, he left the unit for the Second and then Seventy-First Regiments until finally leaving for the front lines with the Seventh Regiment. He had to borrow the money to pay for his uniform. After his enlistment period was up, he returned to his home state to raise the First Vermont Cavalry serving with them until 1863. He had reached the rank of Captain by that time and, that summer, he was appointed a provost marshal and assigned to New York City where he would oversee enforcing conscription in the Tenth District. Although criticized for the low number of recruits compared to the other provost marshals in the city, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton defended Erhardt's efforts stating \\"The men he enlists may be few but they go to the front and fight, every one of them. They are not bounty jumpers\\". In the days before the New York Draft Riots, he was confronted by several men with iron bars while trying to collect names in a new tenement building at Broadway and Liberty Street. Erhardt held the men off for three hours while waiting for reinforcements, armed only with his pistol, but was eventually forced to retreat without the names.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 113) ==Mid-life== After the war, Erhardt became a lawyer and remained in New York serving as Assistant U.S. District Attorney in Brooklyn. In 1876, Erhardt was named as police commissioner of the New York Police Department by Governor Samuel J. Tilden after the dismissal of George Washington Matsell and Abram Disbecker by Mayor William H. Wickham. Erhardt was a strong advocate of introducing a style of military discipline within the department. He also criticized the substitution of one police commissioner as a replacement for the old four-man committee, commenting that \\"it was an absurdity to have a removable Commissioner at the head of an irremovable force\\"; however, it was widely speculated that for political reasons Mayor Edward Cooper insisted that charges be brought against the previous police commissioners. Nothing came of the trial, however. In 1883, Erhardt was appointed U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of New York by President Chester A. Arthur. He also became receiver of the New York City and Northern Railroad and, by 1888, the annual receipts of the road had risen from $24,000 to $400,000 when he returned control of the line to its owners. He was made its president of the company following its reorganization. That same year, he was nominated by the Republican Party to run for the Mayor of New York. Elihu Root, then U.S. District Attorney and a personal friend of Erhardt while a U.S. Marshal, publicly endorsed his candidacy stating: :His name is the synonym for the faithful discharge of duty. In his business regulations he has won the respect and admiration of all who know him. As a public officer, when fortunes were within his grasp, not a thought of seizing them entered his mind. He is a man vigorously positive, determined, honest, generous and able. Not a stain has been cast on his name. Not a man can say a word against him to impeach his qualifications for the Mayoralty of New York. One of seven candidates, it was suggested at the time that Erhardt had merely been placed on the ticket as a political sacrifice for the Republicans. In spite of this, he made a strong showing in the race but was defeated by the Tammany Hall candidate Hugh J. Grant. Partly due to his popularity in the election, Erhardt was made Collector of the Port of New York shortly afterwards. His appointment was only reluctantly made by Thomas C. Platt, then a leader of the Republican Party in New York, and because of Erhardt's resistance against the city's political machine he and his followers did everything within their power to interfere with and otherwise undermine Erhardt. He finally resigned in 1891 announcing that \\"the Collector has been reduced to a position where he is no longer an independent officer with authority commensurate with his responsibility\\". This was the last position he would ever hold. ==Later life== He was a successful businessman in his later years, serving as the president and director of the Public Accountants' Corporation, trustee of the Bowery Savings Bank, director of Echo Lake Ice Company and interested in several other major corporations. Erhardt was also the director for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals until 1906 when he resigned due to a dispute with the management of the society. He was a member of the Union League Club, Loyal Legion, New England Society, Saint Nicholas Society, Sphinx and Downtown Clubs. In September 1909, Erhardt was staying at the Union League Club while his wife, Nora Belle Jewett, was visiting their daughter at York Harbor, Maine for part of the summer. He had told his private secretary that he had not been feeling well, believing he may have developed rheumatism, and his friends at the club noticed that he had been in ill health during the last month but appeared well while staying at the club. On the morning of September 7, at about 1:00 a.m., the club watchman was passing Erhardt's room and saw him sitting at the side of his bed. Erhardt told them to get a doctor at once. His family physician, Dr. John Solley, was called from his home on West Fifty-Eighth Street but Erhardt died at 1.20 a.m. At the time of his death, he was the president of the Lawyers' Surety Company and a director in a number of corporations. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Astor, Gerald.

Known in the newspapers as \\"the Ivy League Mobster\\", he was the head of the Chicago Outfit's slot machine racket. Larner, who was Jewish, kept a low profile but was very powerful with the Chicago underworld. After Eddie Vogel retired from the gambling machine business, Larner became the power behind the scenes. When he testified before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management in 1959, he invoked his Fifth Amendment rights fifty-four times. Larner expanded the Outfit's gambling and smuggling operations to Panama and Iran, moving the organization's Miami operation's headquarters to Panama where money laundering was more easily facilitated by local banks. These operations were conducted as a partnership between the Mafia and the CIA. By 1966, this partnership had developed into arms smuggling to the Middle East for the Israeli Mossad, all via Panama. Larner had friends among world leaders and key players in the Central Intelligence Agency and the U.S. military, and he was also well connected with Las Vegas bosses like the Teamsters' Allen Dorfman and media mogul Hank Greenspun. One of Larner's closest friends was Meyer Lansky, and the two shared in their passionate Zionism and defense for the Jews' divine right to the land of Israel. ==NotesReferences== Category:Jewish-American mobsters Category:Chicago Outfit bosses Category:American Zionists Category:1913 births Category:2002 deaths ","title":"Hyman Larner"},{"id":"20462201","text":"Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy is a rare genetic condition characterized by reduced body fat and increased skeletal muscle size. Affected individuals have up to twice the usual amount of muscle mass in their bodies, but increases in muscle strength are not usually congruent. Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy is not known to cause medical problems, and affected individuals are intellectually normal. The prevalence of this condition is unknown. Mutations in the MSTN gene cause myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy. The MSTN gene provides instructions for making a protein called myostatin, which is active in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) both before and after birth. This protein normally restrains muscle growth, ensuring that muscles do not grow too large. Mutations that reduce the production of functional myostatin lead to an overgrowth of muscle tissue. Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy has a pattern of inheritance known as incomplete autosomal dominance. People with a mutation in both copies of the gene in each cell (homozygotes) have significantly increased muscle mass. People with a mutation in one copy of the MSTN gene in each cell (heterozygotes) also have increased muscle bulk but to a lesser degree. The effect of this growth factor was first described in cattle as ‚Äúbovine muscular hypertrophy‚Äù by the British farmer H. Culley in 1807. Cattle that have a myostatin gene deletion look unusually and excessively muscular. ==Human- induced myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy== Researchers at Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health in China have edited the genome of beagles to create double the amount of muscle. Of the two beagles that were genetically modified, only one had increased muscle mass. The ultimate aim of this project is to be able to better treat a genetic neuromuscular disease (Parkinson's disease). Besides beagles, genetic modification has also been done in pigs and fish. == See also == * Gene doping * Muscle hypertrophy * Myostatin * Hysterical strength * activin A ==References External links == * * Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy at NIH Genetics Home Reference Category:Muscular disorders Category:Genetic diseases and disorders Category:Rare diseases Category:Syndromes affecting muscles ","title":"Myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy"},{"id":"20462211","text":"The Western Hotel, or Joseph Nichols' Tavern, is a historic building located at Lynchburg, Virginia.

There are two full-service library facilities: Cook Park Library, 413 N. Milwaukee Ave. in Libertyville, and Aspen Drive Library, 701 Aspen Drive in Vernon Hills. CMPLD is a member of the Reaching Across Illinois Library System (RAILS). The former Cook Memorial Library building, in Cook Park at 413 N. Milwaukee Ave., Libertyville, Illinois, is a classical revival building constructed in 1879 as the home of area businessman Ansel Brainerd Cook; it is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. ==History== Local library service began in 1909 when the Alpha Club (now the Libertyville Woman‚Äôs Club) began a subscription library in Decker and Bond, a local drugstore. The small collection soon outgrew the few shelves in the drugstore and in 1914 found a new home in the Libertyville Village Hall. In 1921, the home and property of Ansel B. Cook were left to the village of Libertyville for library and park purposes; Cook Memorial Library opened to the public in November of that year. The first head librarian, Blanche Mitchell, lived with her husband in one of the upstairs rooms of Cook House. In 1924, the Libertyville Township Library Board was organized to operate Cook Memorial Library, and library service continued to be offered to the community from the Cook House. As the library‚Äôs collection expanded to meet the demands of a growing population, the Children‚Äôs Department was moved offsite. In 1968, a new brick building was constructed behind the Cook House, bringing the collection back together in one facility. The township library board was dissolved in 1973 with the formation of the Cook Memorial Public Library District. Shortly thereafter, parts of northern Vernon Township were annexed into the library district. In 1974, an automated circulation system was installed. In 1984, the basement was expanded by to house the Children‚Äôs Department, office space, and a public meeting room. Public internet stations were installed in 1995. As the population served by CMPLD continued to grow, library space became crowded: By 1996, the library district‚Äôs population was more than 47,000 and its annual circulation was more than one million items. Three unsuccessful referenda left the southern part of the library district underserved. In 2002, then serving a population of more than 58,000, CMPLD entered into an agreement with Vernon Hills to rent space in the lower level of its Village Hall on Evergreen Drive. The Evergreen Interim Library, , opened on January 13, 2003. To alleviate a continued lack of adequate space, in 2007 the CMPLD board adopted an expansion proposal calling for the addition of to the district's facilities. The $14-million project called for the construction of a library on Aspen Drive in Vernon Hills and adding about to Cook Park Library, along with renovating existing space at the site. While the Cook Park site was being remodeled, a temporary library location was established in order to continue services and programming. The new Aspen Drive Library opened on July 10, 2010. The remodeled Cook Park Library reopened on January 8, 2011. As of 2015, the Cook Memorial Public Library District was serving 60,000 people in Libertyville, Vernon Hills, Green Oaks, and Mundelein. The library district continues to operate two full-service libraries, a digital/eLibrary collection, as well as a Bookmobile, and Outreach. ===Library Directors=== *Verna E.

Iggesund has a market share of about 20% in this sector. ==History== Iggesund is an industrial village in Sweden. Isak Breant Sr, a businessman and former court commissioner to Queen Kristina, established there a mill in 1685. Iggesunds Bruk (English:mill) was originally an ironworks, and the nearby forests were used to produce charcoal for the factory. In 1771, Iggesund Bruk acquired a small nearby company that made paper, √ñstan√• paper mill. It was one of the first to try to use sawdust and wood to produce paper. However, the technique remained experimental. The mill burnt down in 1842. In 1869, Baron Gustav Tamm became the owner of Iggesunds Bruk, and built a large sawmill. It was a major transformation for the factory, which had always been an ironworks. Iggesund‚Äôs shares were first listed on Stockholmsb√∂rsen in 1949. Lars G.

He completed his schooling in 1906, securing a Brown Scholarship to assist him in his university studies; he was also awarded an Entrance Scholarship by Clare College, Cambridge, where he went to study for the Mathematical Tripos. He took Part I of the degree in 1909, placing joint fourth in the class,Obituary in J. London Math. Soc. 21 (1946) 74-80 and Part II in 1910. During his undergraduate years, under the tutelage of G B Matthews, Berwick became interested in number theory. He submitted an essay entitled An illustration of the theory of relative corpora for the Smith's Prize in 1911; the essay was placed second in the prize competition. He then co-wrote, with Matthews, a paper On the reduction of arithmetical binary cubics which have a negative determinant: it was published after Berwick had left Cambridge to take up an assistant lectureship at the University of Bristol, and was the only paper Berwick co-authored in his career. Berwick taught at Bristol until 1913 when he took up another lectureship at the University College of Bangor. With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 Berwick began war work on the Technical Staff of the Anti-Aircraft Experimental Section of the Munitions Inventions Department at Portsmouth. For the 1919-20 academic year Berwick was appointed acting head of the Bangor mathematics department; he then took up a lectureship at the University of Leeds, earning promotion to a Readership in Mathematical Analysis there in 1921. He was also elected to a fellowship at Clare College, Cambridge, in 1921. In 1926, with thirteen research papers to his name, Berwick returned to Bangor to serve as Chairman of Mathematics. He had in 1925 become a member of the Council of the London Mathematical Society; in 1929 he was appointed Vice-President. He retired the post in 1941, at which point he was created Emeritus Professor.Prof. W. E. H. Berwick obituary, Nature 154, 265-265 (26 August 1944) ==Research and publications== Berwick was an algebraist, and worked on the problem of computing an integral basis for the algebraic integers in a simple algebraic extension of the rationals, and studied rings in algebraic integers. In 1927 he published Integral Bases, an ambitious account that used heavy numerical computations in place of practical proofs. He published sixteen papers, ten of them -- including a 1915 paper giving sufficient conditions for a quintic expression to be solved by radicals -- in Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society. Much of his work gained recognition only in the 1960s, when it was republished. ==Personal life== Berwick was described as a tall man with a distinctive voice and forthright personal style.Srinivasa Ramanujan et al.

He had a keen interest in teaching, publishing a number of mathematical recreation articles and giving several addresses at meetings of the British Association. In 1923, while living in Leeds, Berwick married Daisy May Thomas, the daughter of Dr W R Thomas. His health began to fail after his 1926 return to Bangor; he published only five further papers after taking up this position.Profile at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, St Andrews University, Scotland He died in Bangor in 1944. ==Legacy== Berwick endowed funds for two prizes to the London Mathematical Society; after his death they were used to create the Senior Berwick prize and Junior Berwick prize, both of which are still awarded. ==References== Category:20th-century British mathematicians Category:1888 births Category:1944 deaths ","title":"William Edward Hodgson Berwick"},{"id":"20462266","text":"The 17th Parachute Engineer Regiment () is heir to the traditions of the 17th Colonial Engineer Regiment () which illustrated itself during World War II.

While landing at Omsk Airport on Thursday, 11 October 1984, the aircraft crashed into maintenance vehicles on the runway, killing 174 people on board and 4 on the ground. While a chain of mistakes in airport operations contributed to the accident, its major cause was an air traffic controller falling asleep on duty. , this remains the deadliest aviation accident on Russian territory. It was also the deadliest aviation accident involving a Tupolev Tu-154 at the time until the crash of Aeroflot Flight 7425 9 months later; as of 2020, it still ranks the second-deadliest accident involving a Tupolev Tu-154. ==Accident details== At 5:00 am local time (UTC/GMT +7 hours), Flight 3352 was preparing to land at Tsentralny Airport in Omsk, a key Russian city in southwestern Siberia, which has a population of over 1 million and is the administrative center of Omsk Oblast. At the time, this was the only aircraft approaching Omsk, and it was cleared for landing when it contacted the airport. At 5:20 am, worried that the continuing rain would make the runway overly slippery, the airport ground maintenance crew requested permission to dry the runway. The ground controller on duty gave permission and proceeded to fall asleep soon after, in the process forgetting to switch on the \\"runway occupied\\" warning. Under airport regulations, this procedure should never have happened; permission to close and do maintenance on a runway could only be given by the chief controller, and he was absent. The maintenance crew, following the airport's routine, moved three vehicles to the runway: a UAZ-469 all-terrain vehicle with an attached trailer, operated by a driver and crew manager in front; followed by KrAZ and Ural trucks. The latter were equipped with dry air compressors and loaded with fuel, and weighed 16‚Äì20 tons. The drying detail then proceeded to violate their own safety rules while performing their tasks: all of their vehicles should have their top, flickering lights on continuously. However, the lights were too bright for the maintenance workers' liking, so they kept them lit only until they started and after they finished their work. This intentional oversight was to play a part in the pilots being unable to see the vehicles on the runway (they could not from the air). In contrast, the runway crew saw the Tu-154 coming at them from a good distance, its landing lights on. They did attempt to contact ground control three times about the lights, but received no response and so ignored them, thinking they were being tested by a plane not on final approach. UAZ-469 Around 5:36 am, Flight 3352 requested permission to land from the approach controller. The request was sent twice; the pilots noticed vague contours on the runway and wanted to double check for obstacles. The controller verified the runway status, which remained apparently unoccupied, then contacted the ground controller and received no response, and subsequently contacted the flight controller on internal radio and received an inaudible reply that sounded like \\"..ree\\" (original, ) and was taken as \\"free\\" (; communications were being taped and were analyzed later). The approach controller cleared the landing, though unable to see the runway, and in spite of regulations that required him to keep the flight in the air and double check the runway's status. Both the ground controller and secondary controller should have been able to see the runway, but the former was asleep, and the latter was absent due to staff shortages. At 5:38 am, the flight passed the lowest height at which the flight crew could abort the landing. The aircraft landed at a normal 240 km/h (149 mph/130 knots). On touchdown, the flight crew saw the array of drying vehicles and attempted to turn the aircraft, but were unable to avoid the collision. The plane crashed into the Ural truck and then 200 metres (220 yards) down the runway crashed into the KrAZ, igniting the 7 tons of fuel in each truck and the aircraft's fuel tank. The plane overturned and broke into pieces, some of which crashed into the UAZ-469. A catastrophic fracture of the fuel tanks caused burning fuel to leak into the fuselage, incinerating all but one passenger. The cockpit section detached and flew past the burning vehicles. It suffered no major damage, and all four crew members survived, suffering only minor injuries. They escaped from the cabin and ran to the crash site in an attempt to help the passengers. Four ground maintenance crew were killed instantly inside the vehicles. One survivor in the passenger seat of the UAZ caught on fire, which was extinguished. ==Investigation== A state investigation concluded that the accident was caused by a chain of mistakes owing to the negligence of air traffic controllers, as well as disobedience of basic airport maintenance and safety regulations. The ground controller was found directly responsible, as he fell asleep on the job and thus did not respond to emergency queries; he also allowed the service trucks to move onto the runway and did not mark the runway as occupied. At a hearing he could not recollect his actions during the time in question, but did not deny the charges. He was sentenced to 15 years and committed suicide in prison. In addition, the flight operations manager was sentenced to 15 years in prison, the approach controller to 13 years, and the head of airport maintenance to 12 years.

Future inspections at numerous other Soviet airports also found similar types and numbers of violations of safety regulations, resulting in the firing of several high-level officials thereafter. No pilot error or aircraft deficiency was found. The plane's weight and balance were within its defined norms. Due to poor visibility, the crew could not detect the obstructions on the runway. While they did have some reasonable doubts as to whether or not the runway was occupied, these were allayed by the approach controller's reassurances. The crew had only a few seconds to avoid the collision on the ground; they took evasive action, but could not possibly save the aircraft. They were thus absolved of any blame. The flight and approach controllers were experienced professionals with at least 10 years of service. The ground controller on duty, who was 23 years old, was new. He supposedly had not had enough sleep in the days before the accident, having had to care for his two young children. The formal hearing of the case occurred only three months after the accident, due to the obvious set of circumstances; most of that time was spent on identifying the victims and locating their relatives. All of the accused, as well as their attorneys, received threats and were moved to the hearings under heavy security. ==Technical data and statistics== The Tupolev Tu-154B-1 was operated by Aeroflot (later becoming East Siberia). It was equipped with three Kuznetsov NK-8-2U engines, and first flew in 1977. The flight carried 170 passengers, including 8 teenagers and 16 young children; 2700 kg (6000 lb) of luggage, 306 kg (670 lb) of post, and 1600 kg (3500 lb) of cargo. The flight had a crew of 9. The captain was highly experienced, with 16,365 hours in the air (including 4,303 hours of night flights). The flight was approaching Omsk in poor weather: light rain, visibility 3 km (2 miles) with a 100-metre (110-yard) ceiling. At the time it took place, the accident was the deadliest one in Soviet aviation history. It was surpassed on 10 July 1985 by Aeroflot Flight 7425, another Tu-154, which crashed in Uzbek SSR (modern day Uzbekistan), and killed 200 people. ==See also== *Western Airlines Flight 2605 *Singapore Airlines Flight 006 ==References== Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1984 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Russia 3352 Category:Runway incursions Category:Aviation accidents and incidents caused by air traffic controller error Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Tupolev Tu-154 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the Soviet Union Category:1984 in the Soviet Union Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving ground collisions Category:October 1984 events in Europe ","title":"Aeroflot Flight 3352"},{"id":"20462333","text":"Royal Garden is the largest residential building in height of Brazil, at 140 metres and 42 floors, according to List of skyscrapers in Brazil.

The traditional owners of the areas around the river are the Wurla. It was named after the first European to explore the river, Frank Hann, who had seen it during his expedition to the region in 1898 and named it the Phillips River. It was renamed in 1900 by the Surveyor General H F Johnston to honour Hann; a Philips River already existed in the south of the state. The river rises below Mount Lacy and Sir John Gorge and then flows in a southerly direction past Mount Elizabeth then crossing the Gibb River Road. The river then cuts through the Barnett Range and then passes through the Phillips Range via Moll Gorge and flows through the Barnett Range until it flows into the Fitzroy River, of which it is a tributary, near Pinnamutta-Murrawong Hill. The Hann has 12 tributaries including Traine River, Barnett River, Harris Creek, Bella Creek, Macnamara Creek, Crocodile Creek and Grey Mare Creek. The river has the only known specimens of the grass-like Whiteochloa sp. Hann River, a threatened species of Poaceae, located along its course.

The Coelacanth is the only living example of the fossil Coelacanth fishes Actinistia. They are also the closest link between fish and the first amphibian creatures which made the transition from sea to land in the Devonian period (408-362 Million Years Ago). That such a creature could have existed for so long is nearly incredible, but some say that the cold depths of the West Indian Ocean at which the Coelacanth thrives, and the small number of predators it has, may have helped the species survive eons of change. The Coelacanth was first discovered in 1938 by Marjorie Courtenay Latimer, the curator of a small museum in the port town of East London, as she was visiting a fisherman who would let her search through his boat's catch for interesting specimens. Ironically, Marjorie was only visiting the sea captain to wish him a happy Christmas when she first spotted the Coelacanth's oddly shaped, blue-gray fin protruding from beneath a mountain of fish. Marjorie brought back the specimen to the museum where she compared it against images of known species, and ultimately realized what she had was no ordinary fish. After sending a rough drawing of the fish to Professor J.L.B. Smith, at Rhodes University, Grahamstown, who in turn confirmed that the creature she had discovered on the boat's deck was indeed a prehistoric fish, a Coelacanth to be exact. Since then, Coelacanth populations have been found near Indonesia, South Africa, and other unexpected places. While there have been enough sightings of the creature to indicate that there is more than one area where the species exists, it remains a highly protected and mysterious animal, a living fossil which may, or may not be the only creature from our past which has survived millions of years of evolution. Some place it in the family Rhabdodermatidae. ==References== * Category:Coelacanthiformes Category:Prehistoric lobe-finned fish genera Category:Carboniferous bony fish ","title":"Coelacanthopsis"},{"id":"20462446","text":"Axel Neumann (born 22 April 1952) is a German retired professional footballer who played professionally in the North American Soccer League.

The name comes from the word –º–µ—â—Ä–∞ meshtra, \\"master\\", from Latin magister.

As a result, it includes a large number of Albanian loanwords, e.g. –±—É–∫–∞ buka, \\"bread\\", from buk—ë; –≥—è—Ö—Ç–∞ gyahta, \\"cheese\\", from djath√´; –º–µ—Ä–∞–º meram, \\"to take\\", from marr.

Later, the language spread through migration to northeastern Macedonia (the region of Gotse Delchev), the Rhodope Mountains around Smolyan, and the areas of Asenovgrad, Kazanlak and the sub-Balkan valleys. Although loanwords often remained semantically unchanged, the Bulgarian vocabulary in the sociolect was substituted with native metaphors, metonyms and words from different roots, so as to conceal the true meaning to outsiders, e.g. –º–æ–∫—Ä–∞ mokra (\\"wet\\", fem.) for –≤–æ–¥–∞ voda, \\"water\\"; –≥–ª–µ–¥–∞—á gledach (\\"looker\\") for –æ–∫–æ oko, \\"eye\\", –æ–±–ª–æ oblo (\\"round\\", neut.) for —è–π—Ü–µ yaytse, \\"egg\\". The lexis of Meshterski included not only professional terms and basic vocabulary, but also other words, including religious terms, such as –°–≤–µ—Ç–ª–∏–≤ Svetliv, \\"Luminous\\", referring to God or a saint. Meshterski also spread to other social areas: it was borrowed by tinsmiths in at least one village in the Rhodopes, although with a much reduced vocabulary and renamed to Ganamarski.–ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–æ–≤, \\"–ì–ª–∞–≤–∞ III\\".

The legend presents an orphic theme, and also indicates that the maids may have been seductive forest creatures (Hulders). ==Music connected to the legend== There are a number of folk tunes and dance tunes connected to this legend. In Seljord, a regular suite was performed and preserved, consisting of four separate tunes. The music was played on Willow flute and Hardanger fiddle. Many of the dances are fairly old. Most of this music derives from Seljord, and has been played in unbroken tradition from local fiddlers. Classical composer Edvard Grieg (1843‚Äì1907) arranged one of those dances for piano, and composer Eivind Groven (1901‚Äì1977) played and arranged another. There are in all some twelve to fifteen tunes sorted in three separate suites connected to the legend. ==Art connected to the legend== The legend was first recorded by Andreas Faye (1802‚Äì1869) who published Norske Folke-Sagn, a collection of Norwegian tales and legends in 1837. Later, versions of the tale is recorded by a number of folklorists, among then Magnus Brostrup Landstad, Rikard Berge and Knut Loupedalen. This version is from a collection of Norwegian folk tales and legends dated 1995 The folk tunes connected to the story were collected by Eivind Groven and Arne Bj√∏rndal, as well as Johan Halvorsen. Kivlem√∏yane was also featured in paintings by Norwegian illustrator and painter Johanna Bugge Berge (1874-1961). ==See also== * Stanton Drew stone circles ==References== Category:Norwegian folklore Category:Norwegian folk music ","title":"Kivlem√∏yane"},{"id":"20462525","text":" FV Ekawat Nava 5 was a hijacked Kiribati-flagged, Thai-owned deep-sea fishing trawler that was sunk by of the Indian Navy on 18 November 2008. The trawler sank when a fire broke out on the vessel after INS Tabar retaliated to being fired upon by pirates on board. All but one crew member of the trawler were believed killed. ==Accounts of the incident== Ekawat Nava 5 had a crew of 15 Thais and one Cambodian. It was travelling from Oman to Yemen when it was hijacked on 18 November 2008. On the evening of 18 November, INS Tabar was on patrol southwest of Salalah, Oman (near ), when it spotted the hijacked trawler. The vessel was identified by the frigate as a pirate mother ship, as it had two speed boats in tow and men armed with rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and assault rifles on its deck. The frigate ordered the trawler to be boarded for inspection. Upon being refused and threatened by the pirates, the frigate continued to follow the trawler. The official account from the Indian Navy states that the pirates fired at the frigate with an RPG. The frigate fired back in retaliation. Explosions were later heard on board the trawler, possibly due to ammunition or fuel stored on its deck. The trawler sank as a result of the fire. The Indian Navy reported that following the fire on board the vessel, it spotted only the two speed boats fleeing from the scene. It pursued the boats and found one abandoned. It lost track of the other boat in the darkness. An account of the incident narrated by the Thai representative of its owner, Sirichai Fisheries, based on information provided by a surviving Thai crew member, states that Somali pirates had boarded and just taken control of the trawler when INS Tabar arrived on the scene. The crewmember's account stated that the trawler had not been used as a pirate mother ship. Of the original crewmembers of the trawler, the only survivor was picked up by a passing merchant vessel, one was later confirmed dead, while 14 others were reported missing by the owner. The crew of INS Tabar reported seeing only the two motor boats fleeing from the scene of the incident in the darkness. They did not spot any of the original crew of the trawler. The fate of the remaining crew was unknown. An account of the incident from the US Department of State, may have originally stated that the Indian Navy captured some of the pirates. This was however not confirmed by the Indian Navy. ==References== Category:Piracy in Somalia Ekawat Nava 5 Ekawat Nava 5 Ekawat Nava 5 Category:Shipwrecks in the Indian Ocean ","title":"FV Ekawat Nava 5"},{"id":"20462526","text":"Hope River may refer to: * Hope River (Jamaica) * Hope River (Tasman) in the South Island of New Zealand * Hope River (Canterbury) in the South Island of New Zealand * Hope River (West Coast) in the South Island of New Zealand * Hope River (Western Australia) * [Hope River (Canada) Chilliwack,British Columbia == See also == * Hope (disambiguation) * Good Hope River * Little Hope River ","title":"Hope River"},{"id":"20462548","text":"The title page of the autograph score of the Miniatures for two violins and viola, later rearranged as the Romantic Pieces for violin and piano Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k composed his cycle of four Romantic Pieces, Op. 75, B. 150, (), for violin and piano in January 1887. These four pieces are arranged from his previous composition, a trio for two violins and viola, known as Miniatures, Op. 75a, B. 149 (). == Background == The composer's family was living in that time in Prague 2, at 564 ≈Ωitn√° Street, in the same house as Dvo≈ô√°k's mother- in-law. She hired out a room to a young chemistry student, Josef Kruis. Kruis was also an amateur violinist who studied the violin with Jan Pelik√°n, a member of the orchestra of the National Theatre in Prague. They often played violin duets together. Dvo≈ô√°k, a viola player, heard them and got the idea to compose a new chamber work for two violins and viola in order to play with them. The resulting composition was the Terzetto in C major, Op. 74, B. 148, composed from 7 to 14 January 1887. It was, however, too difficult for Kruis, and Dvo≈ô√°k therefore composed another trio, but considerably simpler. The second trio, Miniatures, was written in four movements, which he titled: \\"Cavatina\\", \\"Capriccio\\", \\"Romance\\" and \\"Elegy\\" (\\"Ballad\\"). In the letter dated 18 January 1887 to his German publisher Simrock, Dvo≈ô√°k stated: \\"I am writing little miniatures ‚Äì just imagine ‚Äì for two violins and viola, and I enjoy the work as much as if I were writing a large symphony ‚Äì what do you say to that? Of course, they are meant rather for amateurs, but didn't Beethoven and Schumann also express themselves sometimes with quite simple means ‚Äì and how?...\\" Though he was apparently satisfied with this version of the trio, he nevertheless immediately began to rearrange it for violin and piano. He called the new version Romantic Pieces, Op. 75. The only date appears at the end of the manuscript ‚Äì 25 January 1887. Dvo≈ô√°k later completely forgot about the existence of the trio, and years later in 1901 explained to Simrock that \\"...what is supposed to be a trio...cannot be the Romantic Pieces\\". Dvo≈ô√°k's original manuscript of the trio version (and Kruis' copy of individual parts) was only rediscovered in 1938, and it was proven that he himself was mistaken. The first performance of the Romantic Pieces took place on 30 March 1887 at the chamber concert at the Umƒõleck√° Beseda in Prague. The violin part was played by Karel Ond≈ô√≠ƒçek, at that time leader of the orchestra of the National Theatre (he was a younger brother of the violinist Franti≈°ek Ond≈ô√≠ƒçek), with Dvo≈ô√°k at the piano. The trio version was premiered by members of the Prague Quartet on 24 February 1938 at a concert of Dvo≈ô√°k's chamber music at the Prague City Library. The individual parts were played by Vilibald Schwejda, Herbert Berger and Ladislav ƒåern√Ω. The Romantic Pieces were published in 1887 by the Berlin publishing house of Simrock, the Miniatures in 1945 by Hudebn√≠ Matice Umƒõleck√© Besedy. == Structure Miniatures, trio for two violins and viola=== Originally the set was untitled, but Dvo≈ô√°k called it Miniatures in the aforementioned letter to Simrock. Kruis added the titles to the individual movements, apparently in agreement with the composer. Dvo≈ô√°k completed the cycle of four unrelated short pieces with different themes, with apparent influence of Robert Schumann. A performance of the four pieces would take approximately 14 minutes. The first movement opens in the calm mood of the first violin; only in the middle part is the expression more passionate. The movement is accompanied with a rhythmical ostinato in the second violin and with a \\"bass\\" accompaniment in the viola. The second movement is written in an optimistic mood, with simple harmonic variations. It also contains some reminiscences of folk music, particularly at the end. The shape and mood of the third movement is rather dreamy. The melodic line of the first violin is accompanied by triplets in the second violin. The last movement is the most complicated; its elegiac mood develops from its short opening passage. Dvo≈ô√°k probably intended to create another movement, but it was unfinished, only eight bars are preserved. The whole composition ends with a slow movement, which is rather atypical. ===Romantic pieces for violin and piano=== Dvo≈ô√°k left the musical content of the arrangement for violin and piano almost unchanged; he only slightly altered the harmonic foundations in the first movement (bars 30‚Äì36), and extended the end of the third movement with an additional four bars. He also renamed the second and third movements. == Media See also== *Civilization V, a video game excerpting the fourth movement of Romantic Pieces (Larghetto), in its soundtrack. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Info on a comprehensive Dvorak site Category:Chamber music by Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k Category:1887 compositions ","title":"Romantic Pieces (Dvo≈ô√°k)"},{"id":"20462566","text":"Mariano Stendardo (born 2 May 1983) is an Italian footballer who plays for the Serie D side Giugliano as a defender.

It wanted the Gurkhas who fought for the UK to gain the same rights as their British and Commonwealth counterparts. Essentially the group wanted the law to be changed so that all Gurkhas who fought for the UK will gain a right of abode, whereas under previous legislation they only had a right of abode if they retired after 1997. They took their case to the high court, and had the support of a number of celebrities including perhaps most famously Joanna Lumley. The campaign eventually succeeded. ==Background== Until 2004 Gurkhas were not allowed to settle in the United Kingdom. However, the Labour government under Tony Blair changed the rules so that Gurkhas who retired after 1997 would be allowed to settle in the UK, 1997 being the date when the Gurkha Brigade headquarters moved from Hong Kong to Britain. Soldiers who retired before this date, however, were only allowed the same settlement rights in exceptional circumstance. The Gurkha Justice Campaign wanted the same settlement rights for all Gurkha soldiers. In 2008, the high court ruled that the policy had been illegal since the process used to determine pre-1997 applications was deemed arbitrary. The Government of Gordon Brown agreed to produce new rules. However, when these were unveiled on 24 April 2009, the Gurkhas were furious because there was no automatic right to settle in the UK for all veterans. Indeed, Gurkhas who wanted to settle in the UK would have to meet one or more of five requirements. These were; Gurkha Justice Campaigners, 2008 A Justice For Gurkhas rally, 2009 *Three years continuous residence in the UK during or after service *Close family in the UK *A bravery award of level one to three *Service of 20 years or more in the Gurkha brigade *Chronic or long-term medical condition caused or aggravated by service Campaigners claimed that under the rules, only around 100 Gurkhas would qualify for residence, although the government figures suggested that as many as 4,300 would be eligible to settle. The rules would disqualify many from being able to settle in the United Kingdom, as indicated by an article which appeared in The Economist: > Veterans would be allowed to settle only if they met one or more conditions > based on length of service, gallantry or related illness. Many of the > requirements seemed designed to frustrate: for example, one way to qualify > automatically was by soldiering for at least 20 years, though most rank-and- > file Gurkhas serve for only 15. Another was to prove that a long-term > medical condition was caused or worsened by active service‚Äîa tall order for > those whose injuries were sustained decades ago. The campaign was also supported by the Liberal Democrats. ==Joanna Lumley and the Gurkhas== In 2008 the actress Joanna Lumley, whose father served in the 6th Gurkha Rifles, became the public face of the campaign to provide all Gurkha veterans who served in the British Army before 1997 the right to settle in Britain, and ran a highly publicised and successful campaign. Those serving after 1997 had already been granted permission but the UK Government has not extended the offer to all of the Gurkhas, who are natives of Nepal. They have served Britain for almost 200 years with over 50,000 dying in service, and 13 have been awarded the Victoria Cross. On 20 November 2008, Lumley led a large all party group including Gurkhas starting from Parliament Square to 10 Downing Street with a petition signed by 250,000 people. She supports the Gurkha Justice Campaign. On 24 April 2009 she stated that she was \\"ashamed\\" of the UK administration's decision to affix five criteria to the Gurkhas' right to settle in the UK. With the support of both Opposition parties and Labour rebel MPs on 29 April 2009 a Liberal Democrat motion that all Gurkhas be offered an equal right of residence was passed, allowing Gurkhas who served before 1997 residence in the UK. Following the Government defeat, the Minister for Immigration Phil Woolas announced that a further review would be completed by the middle of July. Nick Clegg being presented with a Gurkha hat by a Gurkha veteran during his visit to Maidstone, to celebrate the success of their joint campaign for the right to live in Britain, 2009.On 5 May Joanna Lumley said that she had received private assurances of support from a senior member of the Royal Family, and attended a meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown at 10 Downing Street the following day. Afterwards she described the meeting as \\"extremely positive\\", and praised Brown, saying, \\"I trust him. I rely on him. And I know that he has now taken this matter into his own hands and so today is a very good day\\". However, on the day following the meeting with Brown, five Gurkha veterans who had applied for residency in the United Kingdom received letters telling them that their appeals had been rejected. Lumley confronted Phil Woolas at the BBC Westminster studios about the issue and, after pursuing him around the studio, the pair held an impromptu press conference in which she pressured him into agreeing to further talks over the issue. Following a Commons Home Affairs Committee meeting in which talks were held between campaigners, the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office on 19 May 2009, Gordon Brown announced to the House of Commons on 20 May that the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith would make a statement on the issue the following day. Smith subsequently announced that all Gurkha veterans who had served four years or more in the British Army before 1997 would be allowed to settle in Britain. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Gurkha Justice Campaign website Category:Brigade of Gurkhas Category:British veterans' organisations Category:Gurkhas ","title":"Gurkha Justice Campaign"},{"id":"20462631","text":"Stanis≈Çaw Andrzej \\"Stan\\" Terlecki (13 November 1955 ‚Äì 28 December 2017Nie ≈ºyje Stanis≈Çaw Terlecki.

Serenianus was born in Pannonia.Ammianus Marcellinus, xxvi.5.3. attended at the court of Roman Emperor Constantius II (337-361). It is known that he had been a former general, in charge of the defence of Phoenicia, whose laxity had been the reason for the devastation of the city of Celsein. He was put under trial for treason: he had sent one of his men with an enchanted hat to ask oracles on the Emperor's life. However, even if the charge was demonstrated, he was declared not guilty, thanks to his friends.Ammianus Marcellinus, xiv.7.7-8. In 354 he was sent to Pula, where Caesar Constantius Gallus was under trial for treason, to tell the prisoner that he had been condemned to death; then, together with Apodemius and Pentadius, he executed the Caesar.Ammianus Marcellinus, xiv.11.23. In 364, Emperor Valentinian I proclaimed his brother Valens co-emperor. The two rulers divided among themselves the army and the officers. In this occasion, Serenianus, who had been returned to the reserve for long time, entered at Valens' service as comes domesticorum (\\"commander of the imperial bodyguard\\"). Siliqua of Procopius (365-366). Serenianus was loyal to Emperor Valens and fought against Procopius, but was killed during that war. In 366 he was killed by Marcellus, protector of usurper Procopius, who, in 365, rebelled against Emperor Valens. The story is told differently by the two sources survived, Ammianus Marcellinus and Zosimus. According to Ammianus, Serenianus stayed loyal to Valens. That year Serenianus went to Cyzicus, where he found that an imperial officer called Venustus had brought in that city, for fear of the usurper, the money to pay the troops; Serenianus, confident in the city garrison and in the strength of the city walls, fortified in Cizycus. To obtain that money, Procopius collected a strong army and put under siege Cyzicus, capturing the city and Serenianus, who was sent, as a prisoner, to Nicaea.Ammianus Marcellinus, xxvi.8.6-11. After Procopius was killed, Marcellus, who was in command of the garrison of Nicaea, during the night entered the Palace, where Serenianus was held, and killed him.Ammianus Marcellinus, xxvi.10.1. According to Zosimus, who follows Eunapius, Serenianus was in Bithynia, leading some cavalry units, and Procopius sent Marcellinus to Bithynia to neutralize this menace. Serenianus occupied Cyzicus, but Marcellinus put under siege and captured the city, pursued the fleeing Serenianus in Lydia and killed him.Zosimus, iv.6.4-5. Ammianus had a mad opinion of Serenianus, whom he describes rude and cruel, and says that Marcellus' only merit was to have killed Serenianus and saved thus many lives, as Serenianus, once free, would have damaged many people.Ammianus Marcellinus, xxvi.10.2. == Notes  Bibliography == ;Primari sources * Ammianus Marcellinus, Res Gestae. * Zosimus, New History. ;Secondary sources * Banchich, Thomas, \\"Marcellus (366 A.D.)\\", De Imperatoribus Romanis * Jones, Arnold Hugh Martin, John Robert Martindale, John Morris, The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, Cambridge University Press, 1992, , p. 825\\\\.

It is dedicated to Antoku, a Japanese emperor who died as a child in the Battle of Dan-no-ura (aka Dannoura), which occurred nearby in 1185. This battle was important in the history of Japan because it brought an end to Genpei War in which the Minamoto clan defeated the rival Taira clan, and ended the Taira bid for control of Japan. The shrine is situated on the waterfront of the Kanmon Strait, between the centre of Shimonoseki and the tourist restaurants of Karato, Kanmon Wharf.

This source states that Antoku's grandmother, Nii-no-Ama, who drowned with Antoku, wished for their palace to be created underwater as she jumped into the sea. Ry≈´g≈´-j≈ç is a mythical underwater palace, belonging to the dragon god of the sea. In the Tale of Heike, Nii-no-Ama told Antoku, before jumping, that they would go to an underwater palace, without referring to Ry≈´g≈´-j≈ç. Then, Antoku's mother (Kenreimon-In, aka Taira no Tokuko) had a dream, in which they were living in Ry≈´g≈´-j≈ç.

A large destroyer with long range, capable of providing escort to the new battleship and the two s were considered a part of this reduced spending naval program from the previous Eight-eight fleet project..

These funds were used to complete a second vessel, which was also named Kawakaze.Howarth, The Fighting Ships of the Rising Sun ==Design== Initially conceived of as a follow-on version of the earlier s, however, it was the first to use the new Type 3 120 mm 45 caliber naval guns that were to be used many subsequent classes of Japanese destroyers. In addition, given the experience with deployment of Japanese destroyers for extended periods overseas in World War I, the hull and bow needed to be reinforced to handle heavy seas. Furthermore, the navy wanted to add the latest technologies in terms of the new 533 mm torpedoes in three double launchers. It was furthermore decided to use the same Brown-Curtis heavy fuel oil fired geared steam turbine engines as on the Tenry≈´-class cruisers. The result was a ship was much more powerful that the earlier Isokaze class, and capable of high speed operation. ==Operational history== The Kawakaze-class destroyers served during the interwar period.

It is organized by the Leinster Football Association. Together with the Munster Senior League Senior Premier Division and the Ulster Senior League Senior Division, it forms the third level of the Republic of Ireland football league system. Formed in 1896, it is the oldest association football league in what is now the Republic of Ireland. Shelbourne have won the most titles. However, in more recent seasons Crumlin United, Cherry Orchard, Wayside Celtic and Bangor Celtic have been the divisions strongest teams. In 2014‚Äì15 Bluebell United were Leinster Senior League champions, 27 years after winning their previous title. www.gazettegroup.com Clubs from this division play in the Leinster Senior Cup, the FAI Cup, the FAI Intermediate Cup and the FAI Junior Cup. In recent seasons the winners of the Senior Division have also been invited to play in the League of Ireland Cup. From 1896‚Äì97 until 1964‚Äì65 the league was the de facto second level league in what is now the Republic of Ireland. Initially the Irish Football League was the top level. Then for one season, 1920‚Äì21, the Leinster Senior League was briefly the top level league. However this status was short lived and ended with the establishment of the League of Ireland in 1921‚Äì22. The Leinster Senior League remained a second level league until 1964‚Äì65 when it was effectively replaced by the League of Ireland B Division. With the establishment of the A Championship in 2008 it became a fourth level league. However, since the demise of the A Championship in 2011, it has reverted to third level status. ==2016‚Äì17 teamsPromotion and Relegation== A promotion and relegation system operates within the Leinster Senior League structure itself. However, there is no formal promotion and relegation relationship with the League of Ireland. Teams can only be \\"promoted\\" by sending an application to the FAI. In the past successful and prominent members of the Leinster Senior League have regularly been invited and/or elected to join the League of Ireland. Current League of Ireland clubs Bohemians, Shelbourne, Shamrock Rovers, Sligo Rovers, St Patrick's Athletic and Bray Wanderers are all former Leinster Senior League champions. While Bohemians and Shelbourne were founding members of the League of Ireland, Shamrock Rovers, Sligo Rovers and St Patrick's Athletic were all effectively \\"promoted\\" to the League of Ireland after winning the Leinster Senior League Senior Division title. Incidentally both Rovers and St Pats won successive Leinster Senior League and League of Ireland titles in 1921-22 and 1922-23 and 1950‚Äì51 and 1951‚Äì52 respectively. * Current League of Ireland clubs Athlone Town, Dundalk, Longford Town, UCD and Cabinteely are also former members of the Leinster Senior League * Former League of Ireland clubs Drumcondra, Dolphins, Reds United and St James's Gate have all been Leinster Senior League champions who were then \\"promoted\\" or elected to the League of Ireland. * Shelbourne United, Brideville, Bray Unknowns, Transport, Bray Wanderers, Home Farm and St Francis are all former Leinster Senior League champions who were elected to the League of Ireland several seasons after winning the Leinster title. * Jacobs, Brideville, Transport and St James's Gate all dropped out of the League of Ireland to play in the Leinster Senior League. All four subsequently won the Senior Division. Brideville and Gate both later rejoined the League of Ireland. ==Reserve Teams== Throughout its history the Leinster Senior League Senior Division has regularly featured the reserve teams of League of Ireland teams. The reserve teams of Shelbourne, Bohemians, Shamrock Rovers, St Patrick's Athletic, Brideville, Drumcondra and Dolphins have all been Senior Division champions in their own right. The reserve team of Cabinteely currently plays in the lower levels of the Leinster Senior League. ==HistoryFoundation=== Within a few seasons of the Leinster Football Association been formed in 1892, the Leinster Senior League was established. Ciar√°n Priestley highlights a printed notice in the September 4, 1894 edition of The Irish Times. Under the headline \\"Leinster Football League\\" there is a report of \\"a general meeting of the league... held the other evening at 27 D'Olier Street\\". Priestley also lists Bohemians, Britannia, Dublin University, Leinster Nomads, Phoenix and Montpelier as participants in the first season. The Leinster Senior League website states it was established in 1896. However other sources suggest the league started a little later and was first played for in 1897‚Äì98 and that an unidentified British Army regimental team where the inaugural winners while Shelbourne were runners up.' Leinster Senior League Ciar√°n Priestley: The Bohemian Football Club: The Enduring Legacy of an Idle Youth ===Bohemians and Shelbourne era=== Up until the 1920s the league was dominated by Bohemians and Shelbourne. These two clubs still remain the league's two most successful teams based on titles they won in this era. Even when Bohemians and Shelbourne joined the Irish Football League in 1902 and 1904 respectively, their reserve teams continued to win titles regularly. Initially only St James's Gate and British Army regimental teams challenged the Bohemians/Shelbourne duopoly. During the First World War the Irish Football League was suspended and the senior teams of both Bohemians and Shelbourne rejoined the Leinster Senior League. Meanwhile, their northern counterparts competed in the Belfast & District League. The 1919‚Äì20 saw a return to an all-Ireland league. However further disruption caused by the Irish War of Independence meant this was short lived and at the end of this season Bohemians and Shelbourne withdrew from the Irish Football League permanently. They subsequently rejoined the Leinster Senior League and for the 1920‚Äì21 season. The league now briefly became the top level league in what is now the Republic of Ireland. 1920‚Äì21 also saw Shelbourne United emerge as champions, becoming only the fourth civilian team to win the title. ===1920s=== The 1921‚Äì22 season saw the establishment of the League of Ireland and this had a considerable impact on the Leinster Senior League. All eight founding League of Ireland members ‚Äì Shelbourne, Bohemians, St James's Gate, Jacobs, Olympia, Dublin United, Frankfort and YMCA ‚Äì had all spent the previous season playing in the Leinster Senior League. The emergence of the League of Ireland thus created a number of vacancies in the Senior Division and among the clubs who filled them were Shamrock Rovers. For the 1921‚Äì22 season Rovers were joined in the Senior Division by Bohemians B, St James's Gate B, Bray Unknowns, Midland Athletic, Pioneers, Brooklyn, Shelbourne United, Merrion, Glasnevin, CYMS and Richmond. With a team that included John Joe Flood, William Glen, Bob Fullam and Dinny Doyle, Rovers won the Senior Division and reached the 1921‚Äì22 FAI Cup final. The 1922‚Äì23 season saw the League of Ireland expand to twelve teams. After Frankfort and YMCA dropped out, six new teams ‚Äì Shamrock Rovers, Midland Athletic, Pioneers, Shelbourne United, Athlone Town and Rathmines Athletic ‚Äì were invited to join. Once again the Leinster Senior League provided most of the League of Ireland's newest members. Further vacancies in the Senior Division were now created and among the clubs who subsequently filled them were Brideville, Dolphins, Dundalk and Drumcondra. Like Shelbourne United and Shamrock Rovers before them, Bray Unknowns, Brideville, Drumcondra and Dolphins all won the Leinster Senior League title and were then invited to join the League of Ireland. Brooklyn were also elected to the League of Ireland for the 1923‚Äì24 season. Dundalk joined the Leinster Senior League in 1922‚Äì23. They were runners up in 1923‚Äì24 and then finished third in 1925‚Äì26 before making their League of Ireland debut in 1926‚Äì27. While playing in Leinster Senior League, Drumcondra also won an FAI Intermediate Cup / FAI Cup double in 1926‚Äì27. www.rsssf.com www.shamrockrovers.ie ===1930s=== During the 1930s three more Leinster Senior League champions made the step up to the League of Ireland. These included Sligo Rovers, Brideville and Reds United. At the end of the 1931‚Äì32 League of Ireland season Brideville dropped out. However 1932‚Äì33 saw them win their second Leinster Senior League title. 1932‚Äì33 also Sligo Rovers join the Leinster Senior League. In their first season they finished third. During the season they had twice beaten the champions Brideville and also defeated Bohemians B. In 1933‚Äì34 Sligo Rovers achieved a treble, winning the Leinster Senior League, the FAI Intermediate Cup and the LFA Metropolitan Cup. On the back of this success, they joined the League of Ireland for the 1934‚Äì35 season. The following season, 1935‚Äì36 saw Brideville return to the League of Ireland along with the 1934‚Äì35 Leinster Senior League champions, Reds United. During the late 1930s and 1940s the Leinster Senior League's most successful team was Distillery. They won the title five times during period. However unlike some of their contemporaries, Distillery never moved up the League of Ireland. ===St Patrick's Athletic era=== During the late 1940s and 1950s the strongest team in the Leinster Senior League was St Patrick's Athletic. During this period they won the league title on six occasions. This included four successive titles between 1947‚Äì48 and 1950‚Äì51. In 1947‚Äì48 St Pat's completed a treble after also winning both the FAI Intermediate Cup and Leinster Senior Cup. The 1948‚Äì49 season would see St Pat's win a Leinster Senior League / FAI Intermediate Cup. In 1950‚Äì51 a young Shay Gibbons helped St Pat's win the Leinster Senior League title for a fourth time. St Pat's were subsequently invited to join the 1951‚Äì52 League of Ireland and went on to win their first League of Ireland title at their first attempt. With St Pat's first team now in the League of Ireland, their reserve team won two further Leinster Senior League titles in 1955‚Äì56 and 1956‚Äì57. ==List of winners by club== * Brackets indicate a victory for the club's reserve team. { class=\\" collapsible\\" border=\\"1\\" - ! style=\\"background:silver;\\"  Team ! style=\\"background:silver;\\"  Titles ! style=\\"background:silver;\\"  Seasons won -  Shelbourne  12  1902‚Äì03, 1903‚Äì04, (1906‚Äì07), (1907‚Äì08), (1908‚Äì09), (1910‚Äì11), 1915‚Äì16, 1916‚Äì17, 1918‚Äì19, (1923‚Äì24), (1942‚Äì43), (1943‚Äì44) -  Bohemians  8  1899‚Äì00, 1900‚Äì01, 1901‚Äì02, (1904‚Äì05), (1912‚Äì13), (1913‚Äì14), 1917‚Äì18, (1931‚Äì32) -  Bluebell United  7  1981‚Äì82, 1983‚Äì84, 1985‚Äì86, 1986‚Äì87, 2014‚Äì15, 2015‚Äì16, 2017‚Äì18 -  Cherry Orchard  6  1993‚Äì94, 1994‚Äì95, 1996‚Äì97, 2000‚Äì01, 2001‚Äì02, 2006‚Äì07 -  St. James Gate  6  1909‚Äì10, 1911‚Äì12, 1914‚Äì15, 1919‚Äì20, 1987‚Äì88, 1988‚Äì89 -  TEK United  6  1964‚Äì65, 1965‚Äì66, 1968‚Äì69, 1970‚Äì71, 1974‚Äì75, 1977‚Äì78 -  St. Patrick's Athletic  6  1947‚Äì48, 1948‚Äì49, 1949‚Äì50, 1950‚Äì51, (1955‚Äì56), (1956‚Äì57) -  Crumlin United  6  2007‚Äì08, 2009‚Äì10, 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13, 2013‚Äì14, 2018‚Äì19 -  Wayside Celtic  5  1997‚Äì98, 2002‚Äì03, 2003‚Äì04, 2005‚Äì06, 2010‚Äì11 -  Distillery (Dublin)  5  1935‚Äì36, 1937‚Äì38, 1938‚Äì39, 1940‚Äì41, 1941‚Äì42 -  St. Francis  4  1989‚Äì90, 1991‚Äì92, 1992‚Äì93, 1995‚Äì96 -  Jacobs  4  1952‚Äì53, 1953‚Äì54, 1954‚Äì55, 1967‚Äì68 -  Drumcondra  4  1927‚Äì28, (1928‚Äì29), (1945‚Äì46), (1951‚Äì52) -  Bray Wanderers  3  1957‚Äì58, 1958‚Äì59, 1959‚Äì60 -  Pegasus  3  1975‚Äì76, 1978‚Äì79, 1980‚Äì81 -  Shamrock Rovers/B  3  1921‚Äì22, (1924‚Äì25), (1939‚Äì40) -  British Army''''  3  1897‚Äì98, 1898‚Äì99, 1905‚Äì06 -  Bangor Celtic  2  2004‚Äì05, 2008‚Äì09 -  Hammond Lane  2  1979‚Äì80, 1982‚Äì83 -  Rialto  2  1969‚Äì70, 1972‚Äì73 -  Home Farm  2  1960‚Äì61, 1963‚Äì64 -  Transport  2  1946‚Äì47, 1962‚Äì63 -  Brideville  2  (1925‚Äì26), 1932‚Äì33 -  Dolphin  2  1929‚Äì30, (1930‚Äì31) - St. Mochta's FC 1 2016-17 -  Newbridge Town  1  1998‚Äì99 -  Glanmire Celtic  1  1990‚Äì91 -  St. Mary's (Athlone)  1  1984‚Äì85 -  Aer Lingus  1  1976‚Äì77 -  CYM Terenure  1  1973‚Äì74 -  St. Brendan's  1  1971‚Äì72 -  Glebe North Athletic  1  1966‚Äì67 -  Workman's Club (Dunleary)  1  1961‚Äì62 -  Bradmola  1  1944‚Äì45 -  Fearons Athletic  1  1936‚Äì37 -  Reds United  1  1934‚Äì35 -  Sligo Rovers  1  1933‚Äì34 -  Bendigo  1  1926‚Äì27 -  Shelbourne United  1  1920‚Äì21 -  Bray Unknowns  1  1922‚Äì23 - } ==List of winners by season== { class=\\" collapsible\\" border=\\"1\\" - ! style=\\"background:silver;\\"  Season ! style=\\"background:silver;\\"  Winner ! style=\\"background:silver;\\" Runners-up -15B.C -    - 2018-19 Crumlin United Killester United - 2017-18 Bluebell United F.C.

It is a five-bay, double-pile, central-passage-plan. -story, timberframe, four end chimney Federal-style house. ==History== Samuel Cobbs (who had represented nearby Amelia County in the House of Burgesses in 1747) in 1758 willed his acre estate to his brothers Edmund and John. (John P. Cobbs and later John C. Cobbs would represent Nelson County in the Virginia House of Delegates, the latter possibly the son of Edmund Cobbs Jr. below). Edmund Cobbs in 1760 erected a house on the Bedford County property, and when he died in 1798, his widow received acres and six sons shared about acres. and Accompanying photo Tilghman Cobbs would first represent Bedford County in the state legislature in 1829 and again in 1839-1840. Edmund Cobbs, Jr. had acquired about acres on Cheese Creek, about 5 miles from his father's land, and began the current house in 1810, before acquiring the dower land in an auction after his mother's death in 1814. He enlarged the house significantly between 1825 and 1830 to its present central-passage plan, but used the adjoining land as collateral. He died there in 1856, after selling off much of the land in pieces, several about 1830 and deeding 260 acres in 1843 to his son John C. Cobbs. His declining land and slave ownership may reflect declining soil fertility due to common practices in growing tobacco, as well as his personal moral values. In 1820, the year his daughter Lucy married her cousin Rev. Nicholas Hamner Cobbs, Edmund Cobbs owned 25 enslaved people (including 11 children); he owned 12 slaves in 1830, seven enslaved people in 1840 and nine (including four small children) in 1850. His son and heir John Cabell Cobbs would own 7 slaves (four of them children) in 1860.VAnom pp. 3, 8 Rev. Nicholas Hamner Cobbs taught school at the New London Academy in Bedford County for several years as well as became an Episcopal priest in 1825 and received 38 acres from his father in law in 1828. He founded several Episcopal congregations in Bedford County and nearby areas before accepting a position in Petersburg, and then became bishop of Alabama in 1844.Parker, Lula Jeter (1988). Parker's History of Bedford County, Virginia. Bedford, Virginia: Hamilton's. pp. 119, 127. John C. Cobbs had owned $6,400 in real estate and $5,450 in personal property (including slaves) in 1860; in 1870, the real estate was valued at $1,820 and personal property at $769. His wife became insane when their children ranged in age from six to twenty years old; he would declare bankruptcy four years after the Panic of 1873 and resulting depression. However, the family did not lose the real estate until World War I, possibly because neighbors were in similarly difficult circumstances and fellow Episcopalian and lawyer Martin Parks Burks had set up a trust and was commissioner of accounts.VAnom pp. 8-9 ==Locust Hill== The house was extensively renovated in 1932, after its purchase by John Capron, a colonial history enthusiast who renamed it \\"Locust Hill\\".

Born and raised in Luanda, Angola, Neide started her acting career in local theater in 2003, at the age of 17, being cast in the television soap \\"Sede de Viver\\" a year later. Her singing career officially began in 2007 with the release of the hit single \\"Ol√° Baby\\" in the compilation album Eu e Elas (vol 1), a song for which the video reached the number two spot on the MTV Africa Video Chart. == Early life == Neide was born on July 4, 1986, in Luanda, Angola and is the only child of Jos√© Ant√≥nio Vieira and Isabel Maria de F√°tima Sousa Van-D√∫nem, although she has three half-brothers and six half-sisters.

A Flakkorps was a flexible organization that was made up of a varying number of AA regiments, brigades, or divisions. A total of six flak corps were organized by Germany during the war. The flak corps, while mainly intended to support ground units with concentrated anti-aircraft fire, in many cases provided also antitank support. ==History== Flak corps did not exist before World War II. Until the end of war Germany eventually organized a total of six flak corps, being numbered I - VI,Tessin, p. 363. plus one short-lived special flak corps. Flak corps I and II were formed on 3 October 1939.II Flakkorps They grouped previously existing mobile AA battalions so as to overwhelmingly concentrate their firepower at points of decision on the battlefield. The original two flak corps were used in the Battle of France in 1940, and later inactivated. They were reorganized for the German invasion of Russia and fought for the remainder of the war on the Eastern Front. The I Flak Corps was destroyed at Stalingrad and later formed again. The III Flak Corps was formed in February 1944 and fought on the Western Front. In total, III Flak Corps entered combat in Normandy with 27 heavy batteries, 26 light batteries and some 12,000 men. During the fighting in Normandy in 1944, the III Flak Corps was motorized although not all authorized vehicles were present. It was eventually destroyed in the Ruhr Pocket in April 1945. The IV Flak Corps was formed in July 1944 and supported Army Group G on the Western Front until it surrendered in May 1945. The V Flak Corps was formed in November 1944 and fought in Hungary and Austria. The VI Flak Corps was formed in February 1945 and fought in northern Germany in support of the 1st Parachute Army. The flak corps \\"for special employment\\" (Flakkorps z.b.V.) was organized in 1945 to control V-weapons. ==Organization== Flak corps were large organizations of pre-existing AA units (regiments, brigades, and divisions) rather than being formed as new units from scratch. In 1943 Allied intelligence noted: > The Flak Corps is a wartime organization, and constitutes an operational > reserve of the commander in chief of the German Air Force. It combines great > mobility with heavy fire power. It can be employed in conjunction with > spearheads composed of armored and motorized forces, and with nonmotorized > troops in forcing river crossings and attacking fortified positions. It can > also be deployed as highly mobile artillery to support tank attacks.Lone > Sentry Flak corps did not include the majority of the Germany's flak force. Even considering only the Luftwaffe's flak units dedicated to direct support of Wehrmacht ground troops, most of them were not subordinated to flak corps. Flak corps were either partially motorized or fully motorized, depending on the degree of motorization of their subordinate units. The following orders of battle depict typical flak corps organizations in 1940 and 1944: II Flak Corps, August 1, 1940:http://www.ww2.dk/ground/hq/iiflak.htm *Flak Regiment 103 with three mixedEach mixed battalion (Flak-Abteilung, gemischte or Flak- Abt (gem.)) had approximately three batteries of 88 mm guns along with the light guns. The light battalion had none. AA battalions and two light AA battalions *Flak Regiment 201 with three mixed AA battalions and one light AA battalion *Flak Regiment 202 with three mixed AA battalions and one light AA battalion III Flak Corps, June 6, 1944:http://www.ww2.dk/ground/hq/iiiflak.htm *Flak-Sturm Regiment 1 with two mixed AA battalions *Flak-Sturm Regiment 2 with two mixed AA battalions and one light AA battalion *Flak-Sturm Regiment 3 with two mixed AA battalions and one light AA battalion *Flak-Sturm Regiment 4 with three mixed AA battalions and one light AA battalion ==Assessment== Although the AA guns of all nations in World War II could be used against ground targets, Germany in particular used AA guns in multiple roles. The need for command and control of these assets led to the organization of larger units, culminating with the organization of flak corps. Although the Soviets also organized large air defense units, they were typically not used against ground targets. The flak corps above all provided additional antitank support for the German ground forces. In some cases, such as at Cagny in Normandy, these units achieved significant success against attacking Allied armored vehicles. The use of flak corps as ground warfare assets was complicated because they were part of the air force (Luftwaffe) chain of command even when supporting ground forces (either Heer or Waffen SS). Given the expense of producing AA guns ‚Äì in relation to the cost of antitank guns of the same capabilities ‚Äì it is questionable if their use as antitank weapons was economical. As an organizational form, massed AA-gun formations represented a dead-end as large-caliber AA guns were phased out of military service in the 1950s and replaced by surface to air missiles.www.coldwarrelics.comWerrell, p. 74 ==FootnotesReferences== *Zetterling on III Flak Corps *\\"Tactical Employment of Flak in the Field\\" from Intelligence Bulletin, November 1943 at LoneSentry.com *The Luftwaffe, 1933-1945 *Luftwaffe airborne and field units By Martin Windrow *Tessin, Georg, Verb√§nde und Truppen der deutschen Wehrmacht und Waffen-SS 1939 - 1945, Osnabr√ºck: Biblio Verlag, 1979. . *Werrell, Kenneth P.

The design for U-21 was based on submarines of the Royal Danish Navy's Havmanden class (three of which had been built in Austria-Hungary), and was largely obsolete by the beginning of the war. U-21 was just over long and was armed with two bow torpedo tubes, a deck gun, and a machine gun. Construction on U-21 began in mid 1915 and the boat was launched in September 1916. After suffering damage during a diving trial in January 1917, U-21 underwent seven months of repairs before her commissioning in August 1917. The U-boat conducted patrols off the Albanian coast in October 1917, but experienced the failure of the seal on her main hatch. The repairs kept the boat out of action until June 1918. But in July a piston in her diesel engine broke, knocking the submarine out of the rest of the war. At the end of World War I, U-21 was ceded to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920. U-21 had no wartime successes. == Design and construction == When it became apparent to the Austro-Hungarian Navy that the First World War would not be a short one,Halpern, p. 382. they moved to bolster their U-boat fleet by seizing the plans for the Danish Havmanden class submarines,Gardiner, p. 344. three of which had been built at Whitehead & Co. in Fiume. Although the Austro-Hungarian Navy was not happy with the design, which was largely obsolete,Halpern, p. 383.Gardiner, p. 341. it was the only design for which plans were available and which could be begun immediately in domestic shipyards. The Austro-Hungarian Navy unenthusiastically placed orders for U-21 and her three sister boats on 27 March 1915. U-21 was one of two boats of the class to be built at the Pola Navy Yard. Due to demands by the Hungarian government, subcontracts for the class were divided between Hungarian and Austrian firms, and this politically expedient solution worsened technical problems with the design, resulting in numerous modifications and delays for the class in general. U-21 was an ocean-going submarine that displaced surfaced and submerged and was designed for a complement of 18. She was long with a beam of and a draft of . For propulsion, she featured a single shaft, a single diesel engine for surface running, and a single electric motor for submerged travel. She was capable of while surfaced and while submerged. Although there is no specific notation of a range for U-21, the Havmanden class, upon which the U-20 class was based, had a range of at , surfaced, and at submerged. U-21 was armed with two torpedo tubes located in the front and carried a complement of two torpedoes. She was also equipped with a deck gun and an machine gun. == Service career == U-21 was launched on 15 August 1916, the first of the four U-20-class boats. During a diving trial in January 1917, the submarine was damaged when it sank too deep, requiring repairs that took place over the next seven months. U-21 was commissioned on 15 August under the command of Linienschiffsleutnant Hugo von Seyffertitz. A 31-year-old native of Brixen, von Seyffertitz was a first-time U-boat commander. Ten days after commissioning, U-21 safely submerged to a depth of . However, her nose was dented when she hit bottom on another test dive in September, necessitating more repairs. On 29 September, von Seyffertitz steered the boat from the submarine base at Brioni to Cattaro, where she arrived on 1 October. On 4 October, U-21 set out for a patrol off the coast of Albania, but had returned to Cattaro by mid October. On 15 October, von Seyffertitz and U-21 departed from Cattaro to begin their first Mediterranean deployment. Slated to sail into the Ionian Sea, U-21 instead had to turn back the following day when the main hatch seal on the conning tower leaked and could not be repaired. After her 18 October return to Cattaro, she sailed for Pola, arriving on 24 October. There, she would undergo another lengthy stay in port for repairs. While U-21 was under repair, von Seyffertitz was transferred to . Linienschiffleutnant Robert D√ºrrial was assigned the new commander of U-21 on 24 March 1918. The 26-year-old Galician had served as commander of for four months in 1917. D√ºrrial led U-21 out of Pola on 1 June for Cattaro, making stops en route at Arbe and Novigrad for repairs to the gyrocompass. On 16 July, while conducting patrols off the Albanian coast, a piston in U-21s diesel engine broke and D√ºrrial put in at Djenovic. On 25 July, U-21 was towed to Pola, where she remained until the end of the war.Gibson and Prendergast, p. 279. She was ceded to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped in 1920.

(The first two lines are: Who‚Äôs the leader of the Club that‚Äôs made for you and me? M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E!) The song is reprised with the slower \\"it's time to say goodbye\\" verse, at the end of each episode. In the show's opening, the song is partially performed by the characters Dumbo and Jiminy Cricket. It also ended with Donald Duck attempting to hit a gong with the \\"Mickey Mouse Club\\" title on it, but would end with comic results, such as him getting hit by lightning, or the gong turning out to be a pie, or Donald just hitting a triangle instead. The song was written by the Mickey Mouse Club host Jimmie Dodd and was published by Hal Leonard Corporation, July 1, 1955. Dodd, who was a guitarist and musician hired by Walt Disney as a songwriter, wrote other songs used over the course of the series, as well, such as the ‚Äútheme day‚Äù songs sung on the show. ==Cover versions== Julie London covered the song on her 1967 album, Nice Girls Don't Stay for Breakfast. Mannheim Steamroller covered the song as the final track on the album, Mannheim Steamroller Meets the Mouse (1999). In 2000, a eurobeat version of the song was released on the Japan-only Eurobeat Disney, recorded by Domino and Dave Rodgers. Andrew W.K. also covered the song, on the Japanese-only release of the album Mosh Pit On Disney (2004). In 2017, D-Metal Stars created a Heavy Metal cover of the song on the album \\"Metal Disney\\" featuring Mike Vescera and Rudy Sarzo There was a gachimuchi cover made of Mickey Mouse March called \\"Bockey Mouse March\\" on YouTube, receiving immense amount of popularity until it was removed by YouTube. ==In popular culture== * In M*A*S*H season 5 (1976‚Äì77), Hawkeye Pierce sings the M-O-U-S-E line of the song after Radar O'Reilly spells out a name.

The intangibles tax was levied on individuals‚Äô holdings of stock and bonds. The revenue was collected in the county of origin and was distributed to libraries based on need. In 1983, the Ohio General Assembly repealed the intangibles tax and replaced it with the Library and Local Government Support Fund or LLGSF. An amount of the personal income tax equaling 6.3% of Ohio‚Äôs personal income tax receipts were earmarked for the LLGSF. This funding was divided using an equalization formula so that underserved areas would receive a guaranteed share. In 1993, the General Assembly passed legislation reducing the LLGSF from 6.3% to 5.7% of personal income tax. It remained at that level until the 2002-2003 biennium budget called for the funding to be frozen at the same level as July 2000 through June 2001. This was the beginning of a funding freeze which lasted through December 2007. Beginning with January 2008 distributions, a new funding source was developed. This fund named the Public Library Fund or PLF is 2.22% of the state‚Äôs total general tax revenue.Puskarich Public Library System ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Public libraries in Ohio Category:Education in Monroe County, Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Monroe County, Ohio ","title":"Monroe County District Library"},{"id":"20463846","text":"Double Dealing is a 1932 British comedy film directed by Leslie S.

It was founded in 1970 when Wilber High School and Clatonia High School consolidated, forming the Wilber Clatonia Public School District, which has 530 students (K-12). The high school enrollment is approximately 258 students (grades 7-12). The Wilber Clatonia Public School District is a consolidated system located in Saline and Gage Counties and covers an area of . It has an assessed valuation of $225,842,971 and provides education to 530 students in kindergarten through grade 12. A $6,125,000 bond passage passed in August 2003 provided for the construction of a Pre-kindergarten to 6th-grade classroom facility with a library, computer lab, and gymnasium. The bond issue also provided for a new running track. ==History== The first class graduated from Wilber High School in 1886. A new high school building was built around 1910. In 1930 a new high school building was built to the east of the old building, and the old high school was used for elementary classes. When the new school district was formed in 1970, a new high school building was built on South Franklin Street. The older school building to the west was torn down and became a playground area. The 1930 high school then became the elementary school, providing facilities for the students in the city and students now attending in town because many of the rural school districts were closed as part of the consolidation. In 2005 the elementary school was added to the existing high school and the 1930 building was torn down. ==Athletics== The school's rival in sports is Tri-County. The school colors are green and white, and the mascot is the wolverine. Wilber Clatonia won the Class C State Championship in girls' basketball in 1983, finishing 27-0 in the season. The 1997-98 wrestling team finished the dual season comprising a record of 6-0-1, the lone tie coming to Lincoln Christian. The Wilber girls' basketball team almost beat the consecutive losing record. In the 2016-17 season, they also won the class C2 football championship. ==External links== * School website * School information Category:Educational institutions established in 1970 Category:Public high schools in Nebraska Category:Schools in Saline County, Nebraska ","title":"Wilber-Clatonia High School"},{"id":"20463912","text":"Kurt Kuykendall is a retired American soccer Goalkeeper who played professionally in the North American Soccer League.

He is best known for his mural work, as part of the Mexican muralism movement, although his work is distinct from the main names associated with it (Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros). His major works include the mural on the main administration building of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Studies and a mural created for the Universidad de Concepci√≥n in Chile. He also created easel works, one of which, La Patria, was well known in Mexico as it was used on the cover of free textbooks from the 1960s into the 1970s. Recognitions for his work include the Premio Nacional de Arte, membership in the Academia de Artes and the Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana, grade Commendatore from the Italian government. ==Life== Gonz√°lez Camarena was born in Guadalajara to Arturo Gonz√°lez and Sara Camarena, both of whom were originally from Arandas. His was an artistic and cultural family as his father was a photographer. He had seven siblings, and his brother Guillermo invented the color television set. From childhood, Jorge showed interest in art. When he visited his aunt Esther, he spent long hours watching her paint while the other children ran in the garden. This inspired him to not only draw, but to also create works in pumice stone, pebbles and clay. He also created his own comic strip called Los Chiquinitos, which he sold to classmates. In 1919, he moved to Mexico City with his family, where he began drawing lessons with a painter named Francisco Zeteno. Seeing Gonz√°lez Camarena's talent, the teacher suggested enrolling him in the Academy of San Carlos. Gonz√°lez Camarena entered the school at age fifteen, just after his father died and his family was taken in by his grandparents. He studied at the Academy intermittently from 1922 to 1930. He was interested in both traditional academic painting and newer trends that were forming. At this time, there was an anti-academic feeling among many younger painters. One result was the establishment of alternate schools called ‚Äúopen air schools‚Äù that focused on spontaneity, light and everyday topics and Gonz√°lez studied at one of these schools as well. Another effect was the establishment of a student movement at the Academy of San Carlos to modernize its teaching and to bring Diego Rivera to teach at the institution. During his school years, his principle teachers included Mateo Herrera and Francisco D√≠az de Le√≥n, working in various media such as fresco, oil on fabric, vinylite, ship paint, tempera, mosaics and ceramics. Gonz√°lez Camarena began his career before leaving school, working with Dr. Atl. In 1930, Dr. Atl gave him his own studio on top of the former monastery of San Juan de Letr√°n. Here he not only painted but also researched music and led discussions on the arts. In 1934, he married Jeannie Barr√© de Saint-Leu with whom he had four children. His new familial responsibilities pushed him to find more work, leading to contacts that began his career as a muralist. His family life affected his painting with his children and even his dog appearing in his artwork. During Gonz√°lez Camarena's career he was also involved in a number of social causes. During his stay in Veracruz to paint a mural, he became involved in an effort in 1953 to save and restore the then crumbling San Juan de Ul√∫a fort, which was set to be destroyed to build new warehouses and a dock. In 1966 he became a formal member of the Seminario de Cultura Mexicana. In 1979, he participated in the IX Congress of the Association of Artists of UNESCO in Stuttgart, Germany. Gonz√°lez Camarena died in 1980 of a brain hemorrhage. His funeral was at the Palacio de Bellas Artes as a national homage and buried at the family crypt in the Pante√≥n de Dolores. The government has suggested that the body be moved to the Rotunda de Personas Ilustres, but the family has refused. There was a dispute for the remaining paintings in the artist's possession at the time of his death. His will stated they should be distribute among family members but this was challenged on court by critic Antonio Luna Arroyo, who even involved UNAM over the disposition of twenty two paintings. ==Career== Mural work depicting Francis of Assisi San Buenaventura and Anthony of Padua in the Sala de Profundis of the cloister of the San Miguel Arcangel monastery in Huejotzingo, Puebla, Mexico Gonz√°lez Camarena began his career working as an assistant to Dr. Atl, coloring the images of church in the book Las iglesias de M√©xico. Dr. Atl became one of Gonz√°lez Camarena's mentors until his death. After he finished with school, Gonz√°lez Camarena first became noted for his work in publicity. In 1929, at age 21, he worked writing and drawing for publications such as Revista de Revistas and Nuestro M√©xico. He also worked into the 1930s creating images for calendar for the Editorial Casa Galas, along with calendars for Cemento Cruz Azul. In 1933, painter Jorge Enciso, then director of the Direcci√≥n de Monumentos Coloniales, commissioned him to restore the 16th-century frescos on the walls of the former monastery of Huejotzingo, Puebla. The project took two years and the project made him sensitive to the area's indigenous people and Mesoamerican art. He used some of the money he earned from the project to research indigenous painters, especially Marcos Cipactli, identifying him not only as one of the contributors to the original Huejotzingo work but also as the painter of the original image of the Virgin of Guadalupe. The latter assertion caused him some controversy. He also did a study on the presence of demon and devil images in Mexican art and folklore. Gonz√°lez Camarena began creating mural works in 1939, with twenty six of the works still remaining. The first was created in the town of Zimapan, Hidalgo at the Hotel Fundaci√≥n called Alegor√≠a de Zimap√°n. At the time, the town was a crossroads for traffic between Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le√≥n, but a new highway changed that later. The hotel was abandoned but the mural remains in good condition. His second mural was a pair of oil an wax panels on stone for the Guardiola Building in 1941 called La vida, la mujer y el hombre (Live, woman and man), commissioned by friend and colleague Carlos Obreg√≥n Santacilia. The work was controversial because the images of the man and woman were nudes, considered immoral by the bankers that sponsored the work. As a response, Gonz√°lez Camarena founded the first Mexican Nudist Society to promote the use of nudes in artwork. The work remained on the building until 1957, when the earthquake of that year caused damage to the piece, and instead of being rescued, it was demolished. In response, muralists from Mexico and other countries founded the Commission of Mural Painting of INBA to protect murals and other art under censorship threat. INBA also proposed that Gonz√°lez Camarena replace the work with a mural at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. This resulted in a mural called Liberaci√≥n de la humanidad, finished in 1963. Other of Gonz√°lez Camarena's early murals include √Åguila en Vuelo for the Banco de M√©xico building in Veracruz and the La Pur√≠sma Church. In 1950 and 1951 he created murals and sculptures for the Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social building on Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City. The mural is done in vinylite, and is accompanied by two groups of sculptures called El Trabajo and Maternidad. He worked on this project with architect Obreg√≥n Santacila, with whom he also founded a movement called Artistic Integration, with the aim of strengthening ties between builders and artists on architectural projects. Historia de M√©xico (History of Mexico, Monterrey, 1954) In 1954, the founder of the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Studies, Eugenio Garza Sada, commissioned Gonz√°lez Camarena to create a mural for what is now the main administration building for the university system. The project consisted of applying Italian mosaic on a relief. This project had him spent much time in Monterrey, and become involved in the artist community there, leading to the creation of the Arte, A.C. cultural group. This mural remains today as a symbol of the institution, even reproduced on class rings. In 1959 Emilio Azc√°rraga Vidaurreta commissioned him to decorate the facade of Televicentro, today Televisa, resulting in a 900m¬≤ mural called Frisos de la television. This outside wall was later damaged, requiring the building to be remodeled. Presencia de Am√©rica Latina (Presence of Latin America, Chile, 1964‚Äì65) In 1965, he was commissioned by the Mexican government to create a mural for the city of Concepci√≥n, Chile, even though the project was threatened by a boycott by artists affiliated with the Generaci√≥n de la Ruptura. The resulting mural was a gift to the people of that region in southern Chile who had suffered a major earthquake in 1960. The resulting work was 300m¬≤ on a wall of the Casa de la Cultura Jos√© Clemente Orozco at the Universidad de Concepci√≥n. For the university's 75th anniversary, the image was reproduced on a Chilean stamp and in 1996, it was named the most beautiful mural in the world at an event in Vienna . The work was damaged during another earthquake, this time in 2010, but restored in 2012 in a joint Mexican-Chilean effort. Other notable murals during Gonz√°lez Camarena's career include La erupci√≥n de Xitle (an oil/wax work) at the Cuicuilco site. Monumento a la Independencia in Dolores Hidalgo, Belisario Dominguez at the Mexican Senate and Las Razas at the Museo Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia, which was used on a Mexican stamp in 1992 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Columbus's arrival to the Americas. His last mural was created in 1978, two years before his death and called Trilog√≠a de Saltillo, in the municipal building of Saltillo, Coahuila. While best known for his mural work, Gonz√°lez Camarena also produced over 2,000 easel work and some sculpture. His best known work of this type is La Patria, an image of a woman with national symbols to represent the country of Mexico. It is well known because from the 1960s into the 1970s, this image was used on the cover of free textbooks produced by the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica. These include over 350 titles totaling over 523 million copies. The image has reappeared sporadically on books produced by the government entity since. At the end of the 1970s, the Mexican government commissioned him to create a painting for the Bulgarian people of Saint George. He was invited to Bulgaria to unveil the painting. In appreciation, the Bulgarian government sponsored a European tour of Gonzalez Camarena's work which ended up in the Museo de Arte Moderno in New York. Most of his easel work is in the hands of private collectors in both Mexico and abroad. These include the Museo Soumaya, the collection of the Carso Foundation, the collection of Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo and the estate of Henry Ford. Some are in the Museo de Arte Moderno. Very little of the artist's work are in the family as the rest were sold. By the 1940s, Gonz√°lez Camarena's work began to draw serious attention from art critics and win awards. In 1966 the Palacio de Bellas Artes organized and anthological exhibition in his honor. In 1967, he received the Order of Merit, grade Commendatore from the Italian government for a portrait of Michelangelo he created for the Italian artist's house in Caprese. He received the Premio Nacional de Artes in 1970 and in 1972 was accepted as a member of the Academia de Artes. He was also a member of the Asociaci√≥n Mexicana de Artes Pl√°sticas and the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. For the 2008 100th anniversary of his birth, institutions such as the Museo Soumaya, the Instituto Polit√©cnical Nacional, the Mexican Senate and the Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social held exhibitions and homage to his work and life. ==Artistry== Gonz√°lez Camarena was a major figure in the Mexican muralism movement. His work was distinguished early through his use of clear lines and texture. He worked with various styles, textures and techniques, ranging from Surrealism to Cubism to Magical Realism, and most of his paintings contains social and mystical motifs. As a painter, he is best known for his depictions of people, especially portraits of women. In the last year of his life, he painted a work called Las razas. This work contains images of four women, Asian, African, European and Native American. In the med 1930s, he developed his own personal method of composition which he called ‚Äúcuadratismo‚Äù or ‚Äúharmonic geometry.‚Äù It was developed from this work with the Huejotzingo restoration project, drawing from Mesoamerican and early colonial mural painting. From then on, it was the main guide for the compositions of his work. Mauricio G√≥mez Mayorga stated that ‚ÄúHis faith in geometry and form, that is, in space and matter, make him a constructor, a builder of plane and mass.‚Äù Although part of the Mexican muralist movement, his work is distinct from the three main names associated with it (Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros). His pre-1949 work was different from that of others in the Mexican muralism movement as they did not deal with topics related to the Mexican Revolution the rescue of Mexico's past or the struggle for social equality. Although Diego Rivera called him ‚Äúthe most Mexican of all,‚Äù Jos√© Clemente Orozco did not like his preference for archeology and Mexico's past, feeling that Gonzalez Camarena squandered his talent by not expressing what he felt. However, Gonz√°lez Camarena began to conform to more of the movement's social and political themes starting in 1949, when he painted the work La vida y la industria for the Cervecer√≠a Modelo brewery in Mexico City. Here did incorporate elements common to Mexican muralism by representing the preparation of beer in a Mesoamerican scene. In the interpretation of Mexican history, Gonzalez Camarena believed that neither the country's indigenous or Spanish cultural background should be denigrated in favor of the other. He also believed that the Mexican Revolution should be honored by working towards social justice. In the work Cristo en la Cruz, the face of Christ has indigenous characteristics. He gave his depictions of Mesoamerican deities mythological qualities similar to the treatment of ancient Greek gods. The Monterrey Institute mural represents the triumph of civilization and culture over the forces of stagnation, apathy and darkness, with the first represented by Quetzalcoatl and the latter by Tezcatlipoca. He also created portraits and self-portraits. Notable examples of these include those of his sister Susana, Francisco D√≠az de Le√≥n, Rosa Luz Alegr√≠a and Guillermo Sober√≥n. In his self- portraits, his eyeglasses generally dominate the composition.

The first section opened in 1885, the line was completed in 1888 and operated as a Queensland Government Railways (QGR) line until 1996. A heritage operation was undertaken for a short period in 2003. The Canungra railway line connected at Logan Village between 1915 and 1955, and the Beaudesert Shire Tramway connected with the terminal between 1903 and 1944. A study was undertaken in 2010 by the Queensland government concerning a potential Salisbury to Beaudesert rail corridor(23 February 2015) Salisbury to Beaudesert Rail Corridor Study . Department of Transport and Main Roads. Retrieved 18 April 2015. as a long term potential proposal. == Route == The 43 kilometre-long line commenced at Bethania railway station () south of Brisbane. It branches off the Beenleigh Line at a triangular junction immediately south of Bethania station () then progresses generally south-west to Jimboomba and then generally south to its terminus at Beaudesert, on the following route. {  + !Point of interest !Coordinates !Notes - Logan River Road crossing   - Waterford railway station   - Buccan railway station   - Logan Village railway station   - junction with the Canungra railway line   - site for future station just north of Camp Cable Road   ‚Äî available online - Jimboomba railway station   - Cedar Grove railway station   - Woodhill railway station   - Veresdale railway station   - Gleneagle railway station   - Beaudesert railway station   } ==History== In 1877, a line was proposed from Wacol to Logan Village, Beaudesert and Tamrookum. A trial survey was taken around 1881 with the route commencing from Goodna. This line proposed 1-in-30 (~3.3%) grades, the steepest on the QGR system at the time, as well as requiring a bridge over the Logan River. The line as built commenced at Bethania on the Beenleigh railway line, south of the Logan River and had the advantage of being a shorter distance of new construction. The section from Bethania to Logan Village was opened on 21 September 1885, with the Logan Village to Beaudesert section opened on 16 May 1888. Initially trains were 'mixed' (i.e. consisting of both passenger carriages and goods wagons) until 1929, from when passenger services used rail motors. Use of the passenger services declined with the increasing ownership of cars following World War II, leading to the termination of the passenger services in 1961. However the Beaudesert abattoir and the dairy farmers continued to use the freight services on the line until freight services terminated on 20 May 1996. The line was unused until Beaudesert railway enthusiasts obtained an Australian Government grant to establish Beaudesert Rail to operate the line as a heritage tourism service. ==Beaudesert Rail== In 2001, a grant provided by the federal government was given to a local group of Beaudesert people who traded as Beaudesert Rail (BR). The group set about acquiring rolling stock and locomotives. The line was upgraded to C17 use. When QGR services still operated on the Beaudesert Branch, only PB15's, B13's, B15's and 60t diesels were used. In order for Beaudesert Rail to commence steam services on the line, they needed to upgrade their track to carry the weight of their C17. The first Beaudesert rail service was held on 18 December 2002 with a run from Beaudesert to Logan Village and return. On 8 March 2003, Beaudesert Rail commenced steam-hauled services. Beaudesert Rail's steam locomotive was an ex- QR C17 #967. Built by Walkers Limited in Maryborough, 967 was in service for 19 years before being placed in a park at Caloundra. In 1985, the Ghan railway bought 967 as a gate train. In 2000, 967 was purchased and road-hauled to Beaudesert. Beaudesert rail then commenced services to Bethania on 4 April 2003. The last service to Bethania took place on 28 June 2003. On that date, Beaudesert Rail's ex-Emu Bay diesel 1105 derailed about south of Bethania, between the Dairy Creek Road and Easterly Street level crossings. Beaudesert rail experienced financial problems and the group disbanded in 2005. In 2006, the Zig Zag Railway acquired the former Beaudesert Rail carriages for use on their Blue Mountains system. ==Remains== Whilst the track has not been substantially removed, many level crossings have been removed and paved over. The corridor is overgrown and many sections are utilised for livestock grazing. At Logan Village, only the platform remains and is covered with growth, the station area is rarely mown and fences have collapsed. At the Waterford - Tamborine road crossing the signals and signage have recently been removed after intersection upgrades. At Jimboomba, all that remains is the track. An attempt to remove the section of line here was made, but not completed. At Beaudesert the station building, water tower stand and the floor of the goods shed remains. Immediately south of the station building, the line has been covered with dirt and is now a car park. However, the station building has been repainted and a new station nameboard installed. ==Proposed Salisbury - Beaudesert line== In 2010 a Queensland Government study proposed a new passenger rail line to Beaudesert utilising (and potentially duplicating and electrifying) the dual gauge line from Salisbury to Kagaru, then a new alignment to Veresdale, where the final ~9 km original alignment to Beaudesert would be utilised.Proposed rail corridor alignment Salisbury to Beaudesert . Retrieved 18 April 2015. In November 2019 the Queensland Government and Australian Government agreed to fund a $10M business case to investigate construction of two electrified narrow-gauge passenger tracks from Salisbury to Beaudesert and two dual-gauge freight tracks between Acacia Ridge and Kagaru, a corridor which is being proposed for the Inland Rail project. ==See also== *Rail transport in Queensland ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Railway lines opened in 1888 Category:Closed railway lines in Queensland Category:Logan City Category:3 ft 6 in gauge railways in Australia Category:1888 establishments in Australia Category:Scenic Rim Region Category:1996 disestablishments in Australia Category:Railway lines closed in 1996 ","title":"Beaudesert railway line"},{"id":"20463950","text":"Norman \\"Norm\\" Wingert (born April 18, 1950) is an American former professional soccer player who played as a goalkeeper.

The song remains popular today as a children's music standard. The opening lines of the song are: Down by the station, early in the morning, see the little pufferbellies all in a row. It is a simple song about a railroad station master seeing the steam locomotives off to work. The song itself is much older than 1948; it has been seen in a 1931 Recreation magazine. Whether deliberately copied or not, the tune is very closely related to the chorus of the French-Canadian folk song \\"Alouette\\". Although the first line is similar to \\"Alouette\\", it is more closely related to the tune of \\"The Itsy-Bitsy Spider,\\" with the first two lines being similar. The third line of \\"Down by the Station\\" is higher in pitch than the second, and the fourth line returns to the pitch of the first line (except for a higher pitched or onomatopoetic \\"Toot! Toot!\\"). Reverend Wilbert Awdry may have been inspired by the words of the song to write his first Railway Series story, Edward's Day Out. The Four Preps recorded a version of \\"Down by the Station\\" in 1959, featuring an entirely different set of lyrics by group members Bruce Belland and Glen Larson. == References == Category:1948 songs Category:1959 singles Category:Children's songs Category:Tommy Dorsey songs Category:Songs about trains Category:Songs written by Slim Gaillard ","title":"Down by the Station"},{"id":"20464002","text":"Bardowiek () is a former town in Germany. ==History== The earliest surviving record of Bardowiek is in the Ratzeburger Hufenregister and dates from 1292.

In one case in 2016 this also led to a criticism of the national institute for communication Baden-Wuerttemberg at the marketing practice of the transmitter. One of the station's most controversial actions took place in summer 2017. Breakfast DJ Rob Green attempted to send a WhatsApp message to Marlen Gr√∂ger, who he expected to be a newsreader for DASDING. Its content stated that if she could leave the studio immediately even when she was reading out the news on that station, she would get a job on \\"Germany's biggest morning show\\". That message was finally sent at 7:31am that day. The message was as follows (originally in German): > Hey Marlen, wenn du jetzt LIVE w√§hrend deiner Nachrichten hinschmei√üt, hab > ich nen Job f√ºr dich in Deutschlands biggster Morningshow auf BigFM! Wir > h√∂ren dich gerade! It turned out that the person who read the newscast at the time on DASDING was Athene Pi Permantier, not Marlen. In addition, Marlen had already finished her contract with DASDING for quite some time and was now working at BigFM. The radio station's production team posted an image of the act as its proof, however it caused some major backlash, with Facebook users calling the act \\"fake news\\", \\"scam\\" and questioning the station's journalistic ethic. Moreover, Baden-W√ºrttemberg Foundation decided to cancel the media partnership with BigFM for an event against fake news, false reports and fake information. The radio station later issued an apology saying they were sorry for this cancellation, but assured it was completely about \\"introducing a new good journalist\\" alone, and argued that the term of \\"fake news\\" was highly questionable, since Rob Green's show was entertainment-oriented, not hard news-oriented. In the comment section under some of the event's reports, some users said the action was not good, but described the excitement as \\"exaggerated.\\" It was also noted that Marlen Gr√∂ger could not read Rob's message whatsoever during the live newscast. After investigating this view was confirmed by the Landesanstalt f√ºr Kommunikation Baden-W√ºrttemberg (LFK). There is also no violation of the state media law. The LFK accused the media criticism website √úbermedien.de for \\"mistakenly\\" reporting about the bigFM action. == Webradios == In addition to the four main BigFM streams, BigFM also provides 22 webradios including: * BigFM Charts * BigFM Hip-Hop * BigFM Dance * BigFM Mashup * BigFM Rock am Ring * BigFM Sunset Lounge * BigFM US Rap & Hip-Hop * BigFM Oldschool Rap & Hip-Hop * BigFM Deutschrap * BigFM Deutscher Hip-Hop Charts * BigFM Oldschool Deutschrap * BigFM Groovenight * BigFM Urban Club Beats * BigFM World Beats * BigFM NitroX EDM & Progressive * BigFM NitroX Deep & Tech House * BigFM Latin Beats * BigFM Dancehall & Reggae Vibez * BigBALKAN * BigSES T√ºrkei * BigRUSSIA * BigORIENT ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official bigFM cityclubbing Website * bigKARRIERE - Job Information Board of BigFM (German) Category:Radio stations in Germany Category:Radio stations established in 2000 ","title":"BigFM"},{"id":"20464056","text":"Renee Godfrey (born Renee Vera Haal; September 1, 1919 ‚Äì May 24, 1964) was an American stage and motion picture actress and singer. ==Biography== Haal was born September 1, 1919, in New York, with Dutch and French ancestry as the daughter of Emil Haall, a Dutch diamond merchant, and his wife. Haal competed in the 1935 and 1937 Miss America pageants as Miss New York. Beginning at age 11, she worked as a model, and as a sophomore in high school she switched to night classes so that she could model during the day. She posed for artist John La Gatta and photographers Edward Steichen, Victor Keppler, John Hutchins, and others. She appeared in advertisements that were published nationally, and she had the most-photographed hands and legs in New York. When a film executive saw her image on a billboard, that led the way to her work in motion pictures. In 1938, she went to London for a singing engagement and met the actor/director/screenwriter Peter Godfrey, whom she married on August 6, 1941. He was almost 20 years her senior. She was featured on both radio and television programs in Britain. She initially entered films at RKO, working as Renee Haal, and made her d√©but in Sam Wood's Kitty Foyle (1940). Also in 1940, she was selected by RKO as that studio's actress most likely to succeed in a film career. Her next movie, Unexpected Uncle (1941), was directed by Peter Godfrey, who also directed her in the romantic thriller Highways by Night in 1942. Her work in Unexpecte Uncle resulted in her signing a long-term contract with RKO early in 1942. She began working as Renee Godfrey in Up in Arms (1944). During World War II, she and her husband entertained troops with amateur magic shows that they put on through the USO. She continued working in small roles, such as Vivian Vedder in Terror by Night (1946), in which she sported a particularly unconvincing English accent, and Mrs. Stebbins in Stanley Kramer's Inherit the Wind. She worked into the 1960s, appearing in Can-Can and Tender Is the Night. With primary focus on raising her three children (which included a set of twins), she was seen only sporadically on TV during the 1950s with guest roles on programs hosted by Loretta Young and Jane Wyman. For the most part, however, Haal was out of view. Her director-husband, who had flourished on 50s TV, was in ill health by the end of the decade. Taking secretarial and real estate classes to help support the family income, Haal tried making a comeback of sorts, finding bit roles in the films. She was also a guest player on such shows as Perry Mason, Hazel, The Donna Reed Show and Wagon Train. ==Death== She died in Los Angeles, California, on 24 May 1964 from the effects of cancer. She was 44 years old. Her final performance in the film, Those Calloways was released posthumously. Her body was buried at Glendale's Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery. ==FilmographyFilms roles=== * Kitty Foyle (1940) - Shopgirl in Elevator (uncredited) * Let's Make Music (1941) - Helen, Chorus Girl (uncredited) * Citizen Kane (1941) - Nurse (uncredited) * Hurry, Charlie, Hurry (1941) - Josephine Whitley (as Renee Haal) * Unexpected Uncle (1941) - Carol West (as Renee Haal) * Wedded Blitz (1942) - (as Renee Haal) * Framing Father (1942) - Mary Adams (as Renee Haal) * Highways by Night (1942) - Ellen Cromwell * Up in Arms (1944) - Goldwyn Girl (uncredited) * Bedside Manner (1945) - Stella Livingston * Terror by Night (1946) - Vivian Vedder * Winter Wonderland (1947) - Phyllis Simpson * Down Missouri Way (1946) - Gloria Baxter * French Leave (1948) - Mimi * The Decision of Christopher Blake (1948) - Sheila, Actress in Play (uncredited) * Can-Can (1960) - Dowager (uncredited) * Inherit the Wind (1960) - Mrs. Stebbins * Tender Is the Night (1962) - Nurse (uncredited) * Those Calloways (1965) - Sarah Mellott (uncredited) (final film role) ===Television roles=== * Duffy's Tavern (1 episode, 1954) - Renee * Dr. Hudson's Secret Journal (1 episode, 1955) - Nurse * The Star and the Story (1 episode, 1956) - Miss Harrington * Buffalo Bill, Jr. (2 episodes, 1956) - Linda Abbott * Letter to Loretta (1 episode, 1956) - Andree Chartaud * Jane Wyman Presents The Fireside Theatre (2 episodes, 1957) - Dorothy / Mrs. Dioso * Zane Grey Theater (2 episodes, 1960) - Alicia * The Ann Sothern Show (1 episode, 1961) - Martha Newton * Frontier Circus (1 episode, 1962) - Stella * Hazel (1 episode, 1962) - Miss Lewis * The Donna Reed Show (1 episode, 1962) - Gloria * Perry Mason (2 episodes, 1960‚Äì1962) - Lady Librarian / Miss Winslow * General Electric Theater (1 episode, 1962) - Ethel * The Alfred Hitchcock Hour (1 episode, 1962) - Hartman's Secretary ==ReferencesRenee Godfrey at weblo.com * Biography at New York Times online * Category:1919 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:Actresses from New York (state) Category:Singers from New York (state) Category:American stage actresses Category:American television actresses Category:American film actresses Category:20th-century American actresses Category:20th-century American singers Category:20th-century American women singers Category:Burials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) ","title":"Renee Godfrey"},{"id":"20464072","text":"Fredensborg Boldklub og Idr√¶tsforening (), known as Fredensborg BI, is a Danish association football club located in the municipality of Fredensborg, which plays in the Denmark Series.

On 23 February 2009, the formation of an alliance between the PCT and the opposition Rally for Democracy and Development (RDD) was announced. The parties agreed to present a single candidate in the 2009 presidential election, and the RDD agreed to join the government if their joint candidate (presumed to be Denis Sassou Nguesso) won the election.\\"Congolese parties forge alliance\\", AFP (IOL), 23 February 2009. Ange Edouard Poungui was chosen as the UPADS candidate by the party's National Council in a primary election on 30 November 2008. His sole rival for the nomination, Joseph Kignoumbi Kia Mboungou (who was the UPADS candidate in the 2002 presidential election), withdrew from the vote, complaining of \\"lack of transparency in the process\\", and Poungui, as the only candidate, received about 85% of the vote. A total of 17 candidates submitted applications to run, and the Constitutional Court approved 13 of them on 18 June.\\"D√©cision de la cour constitutionnelle du 18 Juin 2009\\" , Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, 22 June 2009 . Four candidacies were rejected: those of Poungui, Marcel Guitoukoulou, Rigobert Ngouolali, on the grounds that they had failed to establish their continuous residency in Congo-Brazzaville for at least two years, and that of UPADS dissident Christophe Moukoueke, on the grounds that he exceeded the 70-year age limit for candidates.\\"Congolese Court validates 13 candidates for presidential polls\\" , Pana, 19 June 2009.\\"Congo Republic bars four opposition candidates\\", Reuters, 19 June 2009.\\"Congo bans 4 opposition candidates from vote\\", AFP, 19 June 2009. UPADS spokesman Jean- Claude Ivouloungou denounced the exclusion of Poungui's candidacy and claimed that it was politically motivated, arguing that \\"over the last two years, all the candidates moved around, to visit family abroad, to fine-tune their plans\\". By rejecting Poungui's candidacy, the Constitutional Court's decision removed a key opposition candidate from the election and left Matthias Dzon as the main opposition candidate. ==Conduct== On 10 July, six candidates--Dzon, Guy Romain Kinfoussia, Clement Mierassa, Bonaventure Mizidy Bavoueza, Jean- Francois Tchibinda Kouangou, and Marion Matzimba Ehouango--called for the election to be delayed, claiming that the electoral lists were deeply flawed and included people who were not eligible to vote, as well as people who did not exist at all. At an opposition rally later on the same day, Dzon, Kinfoussia, Mierassa, and Bavoueza called for the people to boycott the election. Tchibinda Kouangou and Ehouango were not present at the rally, but Kinfoussia said that they also backed the call for a boycott. Dzon declared on the occasion that \\"for us, the election is not taking place on July 12 ... It will take place on the day the Congolese people are given a real choice.\\"\\"Opposition candidates urge poll boycott in Congo\\", AFP, 10 July 2009. Roger Bouka Owoko, the head of the Congolese Observatory for Human Rights (OCDH), criticized the electoral lists as \\"grotesque\\" on 11 July, saying that it was impossible that there could be so many people who were entitled to vote. Congo's population was estimated at about 3.6 million, and 2.2 million people were officially registered to vote; however, Bouka Owoko said that an extrapolation of statistics from other countries would predict only about 1.6 million registered voters in a population of 3.6 million.\\"Rights group says Congo poll a fraud\\", AFP, 11 July 2009. Sassou Nguesso, who was expected to win the election easily in the absence of any serious competitors, cast his vote early in the day in northern Brazzaville.

Meanwhile, the news agency Agence France-Presse reported comments from heads of polling stations in which they described turnout as very low, and it quoted an election observer as stating that \\"there are more observers than voters.\\" Late on election day, Alain Akouala Atipault, the Minister of Communication, dismissed the opposition claims as \\"incorrect\\" and said that the presence of 170 international observers disproved the accusations of fraud.\\"Congo counts votes after contested presidential poll\\", AFP, 12 July 2009. He dismissed the opposition's claim that turnout was less than 10% as \\"ludicrous\\", asserting that turnout was strong outside of Brazzaville. The African Union and the Economic Community of Central African States, both of which had observer teams present, endorsed the election as \\"regular, free and transparent\\" in a joint statement, and they praised the \\"calm and serene atmosphere\\" in which the campaign took place.Laudes Martial Mbon, \\"Row rages over Congo presidential poll\\", AFP, 13 July 2009. ==Results== Provisional results were initially planned for release on 14 July, but Minister of Territorial Administration Raymond Mboulou announced that they would be delayed to 15 July because full results from some polling stations had not yet been received.Laudes Martial Mbon, \\"Congo government delays release of election results\\", AFP, 14 July 2009. Mboulou announced the provisional results on 15 July. These results showed Denis Sassou Nguesso winning the election with 78.61% of the vote, while Joseph Kignoumbi Kia Mboungou (who had unsuccessfully sought the UPADS nomination and then ran as an independent) placed second with 7.46% and Liberal Republican Party candidate Nicephore Fylla de Saint-Eudes placed third with 6.98%. Having called on his supporters to boycott, Dzon received 2.30% of the vote. Mboulou said that voter turnout was 66.42%. Sassou Nguesso gave a victory speech at his campaign headquarters, declaring that \\"in peace, freedom and transparency, in the presence of international observers, you have with the 12 July vote renewed your confidence in me\\". He also said that the country was \\"not celebrating the victory of one faction over another, of one Congo over another Congo\\", but rather \\"the victory of democracy in peace and harmony\\". { class= style=text-align:right !Candidate !Party !Votes !% - align=leftDenis Sassou-Nguessoalign=leftPTC‚ÄìRMP1,055,11778.6 - align=leftJoseph Kignoumbi Kia Mboungoualign=leftIndependent100,1817.5 - align=leftNic√©phore Antoine Fylla de Saint-Eudesalign=leftLiberal Republican Party93,7497.0 - align=leftMathias Dzonalign=leftAlliance for the Republic and Democracy30,8612.3 - align=leftJoseph Hondjuila Miokonoalign=leftIndependent27,0602.0 - align=leftGuy Romain Kinfoussiaalign=leftIndependent11,6780.9 - align=leftJean Fran√ßois Tchibinda-Kouangoualign=leftIndependent5,4750.4 - align=leftAnguios Nganguia-Engamb√©align=leftIndependent4,0640.3 - align=leftErnest Bonaventure Mizidi Bavouezaalign=leftIndependent3,5940.3 - align=leftCl√©ment Mierassaalign=leftIndependent3,3050.3 - align=leftBertin Pandi-Ngouarialign=leftIndependent2,7490.2 - align=leftMarion Michel Mandzimba Ehouangoalign=leftIndependent2,6120.2 - align=leftJean Ebinaalign=leftIndependent1,7970.1 - align=left colspan=2Invalid/blank votes38,409‚Äì - align=left colspan=2Total1,380,651100 - align=left colspan=2Registered voters/turnout2,078,80266.4 - align=left colspan=4Source: African Elections Database } ==Aftermath== Kignoumbi Kia Mboungou accepted the results; although he said there might have been shortcomings, he also noted the peaceful atmosphere that was maintained during the election. With regard to turnout, he said that the boycott might have affected it, as well as voter apathy. Kinfoussia, however, described the official turnout rate as \\"totally false\\". Ehouango also rejected the results and said that the opposition could potentially take the matter to the Constitutional Court, although he said that the Court was controlled by Sassou Nguesso. The OCDH claimed that turnout was no higher than 20%, and OCDH head Bouka Owoko argued that the low turnout called Sassou Nguesso's legitimacy into question.Laudes Martial Mbon, \\"Congo candidates challenge 'totally false' vote results\\", AFP, 16 July 2009.

She was purchased in 1874 for the British Arctic Expedition of 1875‚Äì1876 and was sold in 1902. ==Design and Construction== Built in Dundee by Stephens & Sons as the whaler Bloodhound in 1873, she was ideally suited to Arctic exploration. She was purchased by the Admiralty on 5 December 1874 and converted for exploration, commissioning on 13 April 1875. She carried a barque-rig and her Greenock Foundry Company steam engine generated an indicated 312 horsepower. ==CareerBritish Arctic Expedition=== Captain George Strong Nares was placed in command of the 1875 British Arctic Expedition, which aimed to reach the North Pole via Smith Sound, the sea passage between Greenland and Canada's northernmost island, Ellesmere Island. Contemporary geographers proposed that there could be an Open Polar Sea, and that if the thick layer of ice surrounding it were overcome, access to the North Pole by sea might be possible. Ever since Edward Augustus Inglefield had penetrated Smith Sound in 1852, it had been a likely route to the North. Nares commanded the converted sloop HMS Alert, and with him went Discovery, commanded by Captain Henry Frederick Stephenson. HMS Valorous carried extra stores and accompanied the expedition as far as Godhavn. Despite finding heavier-than-expected ice, the expedition pressed on. Leaving Discovery to winter at Lady Franklin Bay, Alert carried on a further through the Robeson Channel, establishing her winter quarters at Floeberg Beach. Spring 1876 saw considerable activity by sledge, charting the coasts of Ellesmere Island and Greenland, but scurvy had begun to take hold, with Alert suffering the greatest burden. On 3 April the second-in-command of Alert, Albert Hastings Markham, took a party north to attempt the Pole. By 11 May, having made slow progress, they reached their greatest latitude at 83¬∞ 20' 26\\"N. Suffering from snow blindness, scurvy and exhaustion, they turned back. The expedition returned to the UK in Autumn 1876 and was well rewarded; Nares was knighted, Markham was promoted to Captain. The geography of northern Canada and Greenland is littered with the names of those connected with the expedition; Cape Discovery () on the northern edge of Ellesmere Island is named for the ship. ===Storeship at Portsmouth=== The Discovery saw no further seagoing service after her return from the Arctic. She was employed as a storeship in Portsmouth Harbour from 1880, probably up until the time of her final disposal. ==Disposal== Discovery was sold to D Murray in February 1902. ==Legacy== RRS Discovery open to the public in Dundee. The 1901 research vessel, built for the British National Antarctic Expedition (1901‚Äì1904), incorporated many of the features of Discovery, as well as taking her name. RRS Discovery was commanded by Robert Falcon Scott and took part in the Discovery Investigations from 1924 to 1931. She is now on permanent display at Dundee. Subsequent Royal Research Ships, launched in 1929 and 1962, have also borne the name, as has Space Shuttle Discovery. == Bibliography == * Narrative of a voyage to the Polar Sea during 1875‚Äì76 in H.M. ships ‚ÄòAlert‚Äô and ‚ÄòDiscovery‚Äô, by Captain George Strong Nares, in two volumes, London 1878; online book Volume 1 & Volume 2 ==References External links == * Category:1873 ships Category:Arctic exploration vessels Category:Ships built in Dundee Category:Survey vessels of the Royal Navy Category:Victorian-era auxiliary ships of the United Kingdom ","title":"HMS Discovery (1874)"},{"id":"20464094","text":"Mick Gosling (born 24 March 1972)Stats from www.theworldsstrongestman.com is famous for being the winner of Britain's Strongest Man contest in 2005.

The Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova (PCRM) won a majority of seats (60 out of 101) for the third consecutive occasion. Turnout was 59%, exceeding the 50% necessary for the election to be valid. Following the elections, Parliament was required to elect a new President of Moldova as the incumbent Vladimir Voronin had to stand down after completing two terms.\\"Communists win Moldovan election\\" BBC News, 6 April 2009 Presidential elections required the winning candidate to receive at least 61 votes, but the opposition parties refused to vote for the three PCRM-nominated candidates in three rounds of voting between May and June 2009, meaning no president was elected. As a result, early parliamentary elections were held in July. ==Background== The European Union called on Moldova to reform its electoral law, which implemented an electoral threshold of 6%, giving smaller parties little chance of entering Parliament. However, President Voronin rejected these calls.Moldova Rejects EU Proposal To Change Election Law Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 3 December 2008 ==Results== Final results were announced on 8 April 2009; the ruling PCRM failed to gain the 61 seats required to elect the president, leaving the opposition parties with the possibility of forcing a new election. A ballot recount performed on 21 April confirmed the results. ==Reactions== The International Election Observation Mission, represented by delegations from the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), and the European Parliament evaluated the elections as positive on the whole, with some reservations not affecting the outcome or the overall initial assessment. The opinion polls before the elections had showed a comfortable win for the Communist Party, with the only uncertainty being the size of the winning margin. The OSCE observer mission has issued a preliminary report declaring the elections generally free and fair and describing Moldova as an \\"overall pluralistic environment, offering voters a distinct political alternative and meeting many of the O.S.C.E. and Council of Europe commitments.\\"The New York Times: \\"After Protests, Moldovan Opposition Claims Election Fraud\\", April 9, 2009 Petros Efthymiou, head of the delegation of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly and Special Co-ordinator of the OSCE short-term observers, said that he was delighted at the progress of democracy in Moldova. \\"These elections were very good and they gave me great confidence in the future of this country,\\" Efthyimou said. However, one member of the 280-strong observation team, Emma Nicholson, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, whose observation post was near the border of the separatist republic of Transnitria, voiced concern over this evaluation, claiming that she had a \\"very, very strong feeling\\" that there have been some manipulation, but she \\"couldn't find any proof\\" of it. She claimed that the Russians from the organization influenced this report.\\"Romania blamed over Moldova riots\\", BBC, April 8, 2009 She also declared that at the counting of the votes that at 1:00 the PCRM had 35% of the votes and the 15‚Äì16 parties from the opposition 40‚Äì45% altogether while shortly later, at 8:00 the situation changed radically and the PCRM had 50%. \\"Emma Nicholson criticƒÉ raportul OSCE referitor la alegerile din Republica Moldova\\" There have also been claims of voter fraud, with deceased and nonattendant persons reportedly voting. http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri- opinii-5560303-revolta-anticomunista-republica-moldova.htm Following the recount, it was decided by the Constitutional Court that the presidential election would have to take place by 7 July 2009. Otherwise parliament would be dissolved and early elections held. The opposition parties stated that they would boycott parliament, citing electoral fraud as the reason, and tried to force new elections. The presidential election was later set for 20 May 2009. ==Aftermath== Following the announcement of preliminary election results on 6 April 2009, which showed the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova victorious, winning approximately 50% of the votes, the opposition rejected the results, accusing the authorities of falsification in the course of counting the votes and demanded new elections. \\"Tinerii zg√¢l≈£√¢ie comunismul la Chi≈üinƒÉu\\", Evenimentul Zilei, April 8, 2009 Opposition and NGO activists have organized protest demonstrations in the center of Chi≈üinƒÉu on April 6th and 7th.\\"The protest initiative group: LDPM is the guilty one for the devastations in the Chi≈üinƒÉu downtown\\", April 08, 2009 Riot police in Chi≈üinƒÉu Protest riot in Chi≈üinƒÉu, 7 April 2009.

The government and opposition parties have accused each other of sending provocateurs to incite the crowds. ===Recount=== On 10 April 2009, Voronin called on the Constitutional Court to authorise a recount of the votes, as demanded by the protesters. On 12 April the court ruled in favor of conducting a recount, which was scheduled to take place on 15 April. On 14 April, Serafim Urechean announced that the three main opposition parties would boycott the recount, citing fears that the government would use it to increase its majority to the 61 seats required to elect the next president. The results of the recount were published on 21 April. No serious errors were determined and the original election result was confirmed.\\"Moldova recount 'confirms result'\\", BBC, April 17, 2009 ===Election of a new president=== One of the first tasks of the newly elected parliament is to elect a new president. Current President Vladimir Voronin is ineligible for another term, as he already served two terms, the maximum number allowed under the constitution. His successor needs to be elected before 8 June 2009 with a three-fifths majority (61 of 101 votes). If no candidate reaches a majority vote before that date, a new parliamentary election will be held. The three opposition parties announced that all of them would vote against the PCRM's nominee for president, for which 61 votes out of 101 are required; if Parliament fails three times to elect a candidate, this will result in a new election. \\"PL, PLDM ≈üi AMN: Alegerile au fost trucate.

The previous parliament failed to elect a new president triggering early parliamentary elections which were held on 29 July 2009. The Parliament had to elect, with a majority of three-fifths the President of Moldova. The ruling Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova (PCRM) nominated Zinaida Grecean√Æi, and a puppet-candidate, a Doctor from Chi≈üinƒÉu. As the PCRM held only 60 of 101 seats in parliament, but 61 votes were required to elect the president, at least one vote from the opposition was required. The opposition (formed by the three liberal-oriented parties the Liberal Party, the Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova, and the Our Moldova Alliance) boycotted the first round of the election held on 20 May 2009, thus forcing repeated parliamentary elections,. The second round was set for 28 May 2009, but it was postponed to 3 June 2009; the PCRM claimed that it was due to Ascension Thursday falling that day. On 3 June 2009, the second round (repeated election) was held, the results being the same: 60 votes for Zinaida Grecean√Æi, forcing incumbent Vladimir Voronin to dissolve the Parliament.

This book, published by TSR, Inc. in 1993, details 50 different artifacts, special magic items found within the game at the Dungeon Master's option. The book was designed primarily by David \\"Zeb\\" Cook, with some additional design by Rich Baker, Wolfgang Baur, Steve and Glenda Burns, Bill Connors, Dale \\"Slade\\" Henson, Colin McComb, Thomas M. Reid, and David Wise. Cover art is by Fred Fields and interior art and icons were designed by Daniel Frazier. ==Introduction== The book's 8-page introduction on pages 3‚Äì10 provides an overview of the contents and the significance of artifacts within the game. One page is spent in an attempt to clear up some misconceptions regarding artifacts, including \\"Artifacts are too powerful for a campaign,\\" \\"All artifacts have horrible curses that keep them from being useful,\\" \\"Artifacts are just collections of random powers,\\" \\"Artifacts are all created by gods that shouldn't be involved in the campaign,\\" \\"Artifacts are found only in the Greyhawk campaign,\\" \\"If the characters stumble across an artifact, it could ruin the campaign,\\" \\"A character with an artifact will ruin the adventure,\\" and \\"Artifacts are nothing but a headache.\\" The next four pages of the introduction provide an explanation of the book's contents by chapter, defines what makes an artifact different from other magic items (an artifact is unique, has a special history, and provides an impetus for a story to be centered on it) and includes a set of guidelines on how a Dungeon Master can create a new artifact for the campaign. The remaining three pages of the introduction serve to explain how the specific artifacts described within the book operate. It explains the common elements of how all artifacts function within a game, and details two common types of special curses an artifact might cause: artifact possession, where an artifact's will can possess a character using the item, and artifact transformation, where the artifact literally transforms a character physically and mentally over time into something else entirely. The format for the artifact descriptions found in the next section is also explained. Each artifact is given a detailed in-game history consisting of one or more paragraphs, and each one provides a section of advice on how the Dungeon Master may use the item within a campaign. Each artifact has its most significant powers detailed, each of which falls into one of five categories: constant (always in effect), invoked (activated intentionally by the character), random (determined by the Dungeon Master or by random roll), resonating (only functioning when two or more pieces of a matched set are joined), and curse (such as artifact possession, artifact transformation, or something else). Lastly, the introduction describes how each artifact has a suggested means of destruction, none of which should be easy for a character to accomplish. ==Artifacts== Fifty individual artifacts are described on pages 11‚Äì106. Most descriptions take up one full page, but a few require more than one page, and all are illustrated. Many of these artifacts have existed since the game's early days, and were originally found in the 1976 supplement Eldritch Wizardry: Axe of the Dwarvish Lords, Baba Yaga's Hut, Codex of the Infinite Planes, Crystal of the Ebon Flame, Hand and Eye of Vecna, Heward's Mystical Organ, Horn of Change, Invulnerable Coat of Arnd, Iron Flask of Tuerny the Merciless, Jacinth of Inestimable Beauty, Mace of Cuthbert, Machine of Lum the Mad, Mighty Servant of Leuk-o, Orbs of Dragonkind, Queen Ehlissa's Marvelous Nightingale, Regalia of Might (Regalia of Good, Regalia of Neutrality, Regalia of Evil), Ring of Gaxx, Rod of Seven Parts, Sword of Kas, and Throne of the Gods.Gygax, Gary, and Brian Blume. Eldritch Wizardry (TSR, 1976) Some of the artifacts in the Book of Artifacts originally appeared in the first edition Dungeon Master's Guide (along with the ones first found in Eldritch Wizardry) in 1979, including: Cup and Talisman of Al'Akbar, Johydee's Mask, Kuroth's Quill, Recorder of Ye'Cind, and Teeth of Dahlvar-Nar.Gygax, Gary. Dungeon Master's Guide (TSR, 1979) Many of the artifacts in this book originated within other products and magazine articles, mostly for specific campaign settings, including: Acorn of Wo-Mai (The Horde: Barbarian Campaign Setting), Apparatus (Ravenloft II: House on Gryphon Hill), Artifurnace (Spelljammer campaign set), Axe of the Emperors (Dragonlance: DLR2 Taladas - The Minotaurs), Blackjammer's Cutlass (Spelljammer: Dragon #159), Book with No End (Dungeon #3), Death Rock (Kara- Tur), Hammer of Gesen (The Horde: Barbarian Campaign Setting), Iron Bow of Gesen (The Horde: Barbarian Campaign Setting), and Triad of Betrayal (Dragonlance: Tales of the Lance). Some of the remaining artifacts made their first appearance in the Book of Artifacts, including: All-Knowing Eye of Yasmin Sira (Al-Qadim), Coin of Jisan the Bountiful (Al-Qadim), Herald of Mei Lung, Ivory Chain of Pao, Monacle of Bagthalos (Forgotten Realms), Obsidian Man of Urik (Dark Sun), Psychometron of Nerad (Dark Sun), Rod of Teeth (Dark Sun), Scepter of the Sorcerer-Kings (Forgotten Realms), Seal of Jafar al-Samal (Al-Qadim), and Silencer of Bodach (Dark Sun). ==Creating Magical Items== This section, from pages 107-129, describes the methods that a character uses to create ordinary magic items (not artifacts) as described in the second edition Dungeon Master's Guide and Tome of Magic. This section details how high in level a character must be to create a particular item, describes the requirements of the work area a character must have to create an item (a wizard's laboratory or a priest's altar, as the case may be), the difficulty of making a particular item, and what sort of magical materials may be needed. It also describes that in order to create an intelligent magic item, the spellcaster's life-force is transferred into the item, leaving the caster's body a lifeless husk. ==Recharging Magical Items== This section, from pages 130-136, describes how a spellcaster character can recharge an item which uses charges, such as wands, rods, staves, and some rings. It describes how this process is completed and what is required, both for wizard items and priest items. ==Appendices== The book ends with a set of three appendices. Appendix A, on page 137 is a list of common rechargeable magical items, referring to the book's previous section. Appendix B, on pages 138-158, is a set of random power tables that some artifacts may possess. Appendix C, on page 159, is simply a blank chart for the Dungeon Master to fill out to assign a list of songs, and their effects, for the Heward's Mystical Organ artifact. ==ReferencesFurther reading== Review: White Wolf #41 (1994) Category:1993 books Category:Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks ","title":"Book of Artifacts"},{"id":"20464196","text":"John Walker Woodhouse (28 January 188413 March 1955) was an Anglican suffragan bishop from 1945New Bishops of Dunwich and Thetford The Times Friday, 22 June 1945; pg. 2; Issue 50175; col D until 1953.Resignation details He was born on 28 January 1884 and educated at Charterhouse and University College, Oxford before embarking on an ecclesiastical career with a curacy at St James, Milton, Portsmouth.Church web site He was made deacon in Advent 1910 (18 December), by John Randolph, Bishop suffragan of Guildford, at Farnham Parish Church and ordained priest on St Thomas' Day 1911 (21 December), by Edward Talbot, Bishop of Winchester, at Holy Trinity Church, Guildford.

The elections were held at the end of the normal four-year term of the General Council (Consell General, Andorra's parliament), but also following months of intense pressure from Co-Prince Nicolas Sarkozy to change the country's banking secrecy laws. The Social Democratic Party led by Jaume Bartumeu was the clear winner, with 45.03% of votes for its national list, followed by the \\"Reformist Coalition\\" led by the Liberal Party of Andorra (32.34%) and the new Andorra for Change party (18.86%).Source: Government of Andorra. The Social Democrats hold fourteen seats in the General Council, against eleven for the Liberals and three for Andorra for Change. The electorate, restricted to Andorran citizens, was 20,298 voters out of a population of about 85,000.. There were 114 candidates for 28 seats, more than one candidate for every 200 voters. Turnout was 75.3%. == Issues == The main issue in the elections is the possible changes required to Andorra's economic model to facilitate its international relations.. On 11 March 2009, three weeks before the 2009 G-20 London Summit, the Head of Government Albert Pintat made a unilateral declaration in Paris promising to improve the exchange of information (for tax purposes) about non-residents who hold bank accounts in Andorra. He committed the incoming government to drafting changes to the banking secrecy laws by 1 September 2009, which would then be passed by the General Council before 15 November 2009.. He also announced that he would not be leading the Liberal Party of Andorra in the elections so as to devote his time to negotiating tax treaties with other countries, starting with France. Such agreements would also abolish the punitive customs duties which France and Spain impose on Andorran exports (33% and 25% respectively).. The Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party have agreed to cooperate in the drafting of the new legislation. The negotiation of tax treaties is complicated by the present tax structure of Andorra. The state is funded mostly by indirect taxation, such as levies on water supplies and telecommunications, and by fees for administrative permits. The Social Democratic Party proposes the introduction of income tax and value added tax, albeit at low rates, whereas the Liberal Party prefers keeping changes to the tax system to a minimum.. Andorra for Change rejects any changes whatsoever to the current system. A third issue is the relationship Andorra should have with the European Economic Area (EEA): at present, Andorra has a limited set of bilateral agreements with the European Union in the fields of economic, social, and cultural cooperation, signed in June 2004. The Social Democratic Party favours expanding these into a fully fledged association agreement; the Liberal Party is more reticent, but has promised to cooperate in any discussions. == Electoral system == Twenty-eight \\"general councillors\\" were elected on 26 April 2009, based on party lists (closed list systemArt. 42.2, Law 28/2007.): *two general councillors from each of the seven parishes, elected from the list with most votes in each parish;Art. 57, Law 28/2007. *fourteen general councillors elected from national lists using the largest remainder method of proportional representation.Art. 58, Law 28/2007.

It is has a wide Indo-Pacific distribution. ==Description== Grammistes sexlineatus is a middle sized fish, which can grow to a maximum length of 30 cm. Its background body color is dark brown with a maximum of six white to yellow horizontal lines. The number of lines depends on the maturity of the fish. Juveniles have white to yellow dots on a dark background until an approximate size of 17.5 mm. Thereafter, the points gradually become lines. At a length of 5 cm, these soap fish have three horizontal lines. Only from 8 cm long that the soapfish gets the six distinctive horizontal lines. Note that in adult specimens close to the maximum size, these lines tend to sever to form small strokes and points. ==Distribution and habitat== The six lined soapfish is widespread throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo- Pacific area from the eastern coast of Africa to the oceanic islands of the Pacific Ocean, including Hawaii and the Red Sea. And from south Japan to north New Zealand. This soapfish occurs in coastal rocky and coral reefs from shallow to 40‚Äì50 meters depth. ==Biology== Individuals are generally solitary in their reef habitat. They usually stay hidden in crevices, and are most active at night. Like other fish in the subfamily Grammistinae, this species produces a toxin from the skin. The toxins in the skin secretions are known as grammistins. These secretions resemble lathered soap and are the basis for the common name of Soap Fish. This is not caught as a food fish because the flesh reportedly has a bitter, unpleasant taste. ==Taxonomy== The goldenstriped soapfish was first formally described as Perca sixlineata in 1792 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg (1743-1828) with the type locality given as the Eat Indes or Japan. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Fish of the Indian Ocean Category:Fish of the Pacific Ocean Category:Grammistini Category:Fish described in 1792 ","title":"Goldenstriped soapfish"},{"id":"20464277","text":"Parliamentary elections were held in the Comoros on 6 December 2009, with a second round on 20 December.

Depending on the definition used, Avisauridae is either a broad and widespread group of advanced enantiornitheans (following Cau & Arduini, 2008), or a small family within that group, restricted to species from the Late Cretaceous of North and South America (following Chiappe, 1992). == Description == Avisaurids were among the largest and last enantiornitheans to have lived, although they are also among the most poorly preserved. The majority of them are known primarily from fossilized tarsometatarsal bones, the part of a bird's leg formed by fused metatarsals (the bones which comprise the foot in humans). As a result, members of this family are distinguished from other enantiornitheans exclusively by features of the tarsometatarsal and pedal phalanges (toe bones). Unlike in some prehistoric birds, avisaurid tarsometatarsals were not completely fused, with the distal (outer) parts of the metatarsals being separate from each other. The proximal (near) half of metatarsal III (the long bone in the middle of the tarsometatarsus) is convex from the front. The inside edge of this bone's trochlea (toe joint) has a bony tab which points downward, known as a plantar projection. The innermost bone of the tarsometatarsus, metatarsal I, is small, laterally compressed (flattened from side-to-side), and J-shaped from the side. It is connected to a reversed hallux sporting a very large and curved claw.Chiappe, Luis M. (1992) \\"Enantiornithine (Aves) Tarsometatarsi from the Cretaceous Lecho Formation of Northwestern Argentina\\" Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. September, 1992. 12 (3): 344-350 Chiappe and Calvo (1994) found that the Avisauridae shared adaptations of the foot ‚Äî including a fully reversed and distally placed hallux with a large claw ‚Äî that indicated the ability to perch in trees. They argued that an arboreal habit was most likely for all of the Avisauridae.Chiappe, Luis M., Calvo, Jorge O. (1994) \\"Neuquenornis volans, a New Late Cretaceous Bird (Enantiornithes: Avisauridae) from Patagonia, Argentina\\". Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. June 22, 1994 Volume 14 No. 2 pp.230-246. == History and classification == Avisauridae was erected as a family by Brett-Surman and Paul in 1985. At that time the family consisted of a few fossils that they believed belonged to small non-avian dinosaurs. They doubted that these fossils belonged to birds due to the presence of several features of the tarsometatarsus. In Avisaurus (the only avisaurid known at that time), only the proximal parts of the metatarsals were fused, the proximal part of metatarsal III was wide, and the hypotarsus (a wide ridge extending down the back of the tarsometatarsus) was poorly developed. However, Chiappe later reassigned the Avisauridae to the class Aves (which is equivalent to the clade Avialae in modern usage) and the subclass Enantiornithes in 1992. He noted that the features used to exclude avisaurids from birds are in fact present in some early birds such as Archaeopteryx, as well as various Cretaceous bird groups. Avisaurids also had a thin metatarsal IV (the outermost long bone of the tarsometatarsus) and a bony knob on the front of metatarsal II (the most innermost long bone of the tarsometatarsus) for the insertion of M. tibialis cranialis (the muscle which flexes the ankle, also known as the M. tibialis anticus or M. tibialis anterior), both believed to be enantiornithean features. Chiappe defined the family as the common ancestor of Neuquenornis volans and Avisaurus archibaldi plus all its descendants. In 2008, the family was given a broader definition courtesy of Cau and Arduini. They redefined the group as Avisaurus archibaldi and all genera more closely related to it than to either Longipteryx, Gobipteryx or Sinornis. Matt Martyniuk gave the name Avisauroidea to this group, although the erection of that name has been criticized by Cau. Under this broader definition, several other enantiornitheans, such as Enantiophoenix, would qualify as members of the family. Nevertheless, enantiornithean taxonomy is notably difficult to resolve, and some analyses on enantiornitheans have not resolved the family. However, this may be due to such analyses focusing on early Cretaceous enantiornitheans (which are numerous and well-preserved) rather than fragmentary late Cretaceous taxa, such as most avisaurids.

The coalition comprising Mauritius Labour Party under Navin Ramgoolam, the Militant Socialist Movement under Pravind Jugnauth and the Mauritian Social Democrat Party under Xavier Luc Duval, won a majority with 41 seats in the parliament. The Mauritian Militant Movement-led coalition under Paul Berenger finished second with 18 seats. The Mauritian Solidarity Front won one seat and the Rodrigues Movement won the two remaining seats. The elections were the ninth to be held since independence from the United Kingdom in 1968. The Mauritius Labour Party, the Mauritian Social Democrat Party (PMSD) and the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM) formed an electoral coalition called Alliance de L'avenir () for this election. Ramgoolam, the alliance leader, allotted 35 seats to his own party to compete for the 60 seats on the island, whereas the MSM was given 18 and the PMSD 7. Before the election, it appeared that Berenger might gain back the PM's post that he held from 2003 to 2005; he was the first prime minister since independence that was not of South Asian origin. Berenger led his own alliance of parties, known as the Alliance du Coeur (), a reference to the official logo of the Mauritian Militant Movement, by far the biggest party in that alliance. Parties based in Rodrigues compete for the two remaining seats, with the Rodrigues People's Organisation and the Rodrigues Movement being the main parties there. During the election, 62 seats in the National Assembly of Mauritius were contested with a further 8 seats to be designated by the electoral commission under a complex formula designed to keep a balance of ethnic groups in the parliament. The candidates must declare which ethnic group (Hindu, Muslim, Chinese or \\"general population\\") they belong to in order to run for a seat. In 2010, 104 of the candidates refused to do so, resulting in them being disqualified, leaving 529 candidates for the seats. Around 130 foreign observers, including some from the African Union and the Southern African Development Community, were present to monitor the voting process. Around 900,000 people were eligible to vote in the election. The main issues debated were economic and constitutional reform, fraud, corruption, drug trafficking and ethnicity. Paul Berenger accused the incumbent government of abusing the state-owned television station, the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation, to influence voters. He also accused his political opponents of using communalism and of negatively drawing attention to his minority Franco- Mauritian ancestry to swing voters against him. The Alliance de l'Avenir obtained 49.31% of the total votes and 41 seats whereas the Alliance du Coeur seized 42.36% of votes and 18 seats. The remaining parties and independent candidates obtained 8.14% of the votes. From the 62 seats, only ten women were elected. After the Alliance de L'Avenir was declared winner of the poll, its leader, Navin Ramgoolam, mentioned that he would govern in the interest of every Mauritian so that no one would be left behind. He added that the priorities of his government were the improvement of road infrastructures, the security of the people, education, health and youth development. Paul Berenger, who conceded defeat after the election, said that members of his party would continue their fight for a better Mauritius. He claimed that this election had not been free and fair, attributing the defeat of his alliance to numerous factors including biased coverage of the election by the state-owned television station, more financial resources by his political opponents, communalism and the electoral system. However, he would be prepared to work with the government for electoral reform, especially because his alliance had obtained only 18 of the 62 seats despite seizing 43% of popular votes. On May 7, 2010, the Electoral Supervisory Commission made their decision on the non- elected candidates to occupy the 8 additional seats in the National Assembly based on the religious and ethnic declarations of the candidates not elected, a system referred to as the 'Best Loser system'. Exceptionally, instead of 8, only 7 candidates were designated. Per the normal procedure, 4 best loser seats are allotted to candidates not elected but having obtained the highest percentage of votes as a member of a political party. However, they had to be of an appropriate religion or ethnic to maintain a balance in the parliament. 4 other seats are to be allotted so as not to change the result of the election. The Alliance de L'Avenir was allotted 4 additional seats whereas the Alliance du Coeur obtained 2 additional seats. Whereas the Electoral Supervisory Commission had no problem in attributing one seat to one candidate of the Rodrigues People's Organisation, they had difficulty in choosing a candidate for the 8th seat, which normally has to be a Sino-Mauritian of one of the two other successful parties in this election. But given neither the Mauritian Solidarity Front nor the Rodrigues Movement had candidates of this community during this election, no candidate was named for the 8th additional seat. Observers from the African Union for this election declared that the Best Loser system is problematic for the national unity of the country though it can reinforce social cohesion. They also considered the 2010 Mauritian general elections to have been 'free and transparent'. ==Results== { class= style=text-align:right !rowspan=2Party !rowspan=2Votes !rowspan=2% !colspan=3Seats - !Elected !Top-up !Total - align=leftAlliance de L'Avenir (PTR‚ÄìPMSD-MSM)1,001,90349.6941445 - align=leftAlliance du Coeur (MMM-UN-MMSD)847,09542.0118220 - align=leftMauritian Solidarity Front51,1612.54101 - align=leftRodrigues Movement20,9331.04202 - align=leftRodrigues People's Organisation18,8150.93011 - align=leftMouvement Democratique National13,9570.69000 - align=leftParti Malin6,8740.34000 - align=leftForum des Citoyens Libres4,1670.21000 - align=leftLes Verts Fraternels2,7220.13000 - align=leftParti Action Liberal2,7040.13000 - align=leftMouvement Authentique Mauricien2,3690.12000 - align=leftParti du Peuple Mauricien2,0720.10000 - align=leftMouvement Travailleurs Mauricien 1,8620.09000 - align=leftMouvement Democratique Mauricien1,7030.08000 - align=leftParti Tireurs Disables1,5490.08000 - align=leftMouvement Citoyen Mauricien1,2900.06000 - align=leftUnion D√©mocratique de Rodrigues1,0590.05000 - align=leftFront Socialiste8400.04000 - align=leftUnion Patriots Ilois Mauricien7520.04000 - align=leftParti Liberateur Mauricien5590.03000 - align=leftUnir pour Batir3550.02000 - align=leftDemocratie Mauricienne2900.01000 - align=leftSocialist Labour Party2710.01000 - align=leftRassemblement Socialiste Mauricien2670.01000 - align=leftMSTMRA2590.01000 - align=leftParti Socialiste Mauricien1850.01000 - align=leftGroupe de Cinq1720.01000 - align=leftFront Progressiste du Peuple Rodriguais1680.01000 - align=leftParti Rodriguais Travailleur Democrate1290.01000 - align=leftRegional Autonomy Movement1240.01000 - align=leftRegroupment Jeunes Socialiste Democrate1110.01000 - align=leftParty Socialiste Plus940.00000 - align=leftMouvement Travailliste Socialiste640.00000 - align=leftMauritius Party Rights610.00000 - align=leftIndependents29,4911.46000 - align=leftTotal2,016,42710062769 - !colspan=7 - align=leftValid votes678,993 colspan=3 rowspan=4 - align=leftInvalid/blank votes  - align=leftTotal 100 - align=leftRegistered voters/turnout  - align=left colspan=6Source: Electoral Commission } == References == Category:Elections in Mauritius Mauritius Category:2010 in Mauritius ","title":"2010 Mauritian general election"},{"id":"20464385","text":"Jacob Eichholtz's self-portrait, 1810 Jacob Eichholtz (1776‚Äì1842) was an early American painter, known primarily for his portraits in the Romantic Victorian tradition. Born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in a family of prosperous Pennsylvania Germans, he spent most of his professional life in Philadelphia. A coppersmith by trade, he turned to painting and achieved both recognition and success despite being mainly self-taught as an artist. He is known to have painted over 800 portraits over the course of 35 years. Hundreds of his works are housed in art museums, historical societies, and private collections throughout the United States. ==Early life== Leonard Eichholtz, portrait by Jacob Eichholtz. The painting was a gift to Jacob's brother. (Original owned by Dorothy Hartlieb.) He was born to Leonard and Catharine Eichholtz, who owned and run the Bull's Head Tavern on East King Street in Lancaster; his father took part in the American Revolutionary War. At age 11, Jacob with his brothers attended the English School at Franklin College in Lancaster where he learned the three Rs ‚Äî reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic. He also took lessons from a sign painter since his parents noticed his inclination to draw, but eventually he was apprenticed as a coppersmith. After his apprenticeship ended, he started as a tinsmith working with sheet iron. By 1805, Eichholtz opened his own shop in Lancaster where he, \\"mended sugar boxes, tinned copper kettles, and made coffee pots, wash basins, lanterns, stills, and funnels.\\"Thomas R. Ryan. Jacob Eichholtz (1776-1842), Lancaster County Historical Society Eichholtz married Catharine Hatz Michael (1770‚Äì1817), a young widow with two children; they had four children of their own, Caroline, Catharine Maria, Rubens Mayer, and Margaret Amelia. In 1818, he married Catharine Trissler of Lancaster, and they had nine children, Edward, Anna Maria, Elizabeth Susanna, Benjamin West, Angelica Kauffman, Rebecca, Henry, Robert Lindsay, and Lavallyn Barry.Eichholtz, Jacob: Biography, National Gallery of ArtHensel, W. U. Jacob Eichholtz, Painter: Some \\"loose Leaves\\" from the Ledger of an Early Lancaster Artist. An Address Delivered at the Opening of an Exposition of the Evolution of Portraiture in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, Under the Auspices of the Lancaster County Historical Society and the Iris Club. Lancaster, Pa: Press of the Brecht printing Co, 1912. ==From tinsmith to painter== From 1808 to 1812, Eichholtz hired several workers to work in the shop, and devoted most of his time to offering his fellow Lancastrians, at first, painted tinware, and then, small profile portraits on wood panels, in order to diversify his business and satisfy his passion for drawing. After developing his abilities as profile painter and gaining enough clients to sustain his family,Note: Eichholtz's great- granddaughter Rebecca Beal identified and catalogued eighty-three Eichholtz's profile paintings; seventy-nine are pre-1817. See: Rebecca Beal. Jacob Eichholtz, 1776‚Äì1842, Portrait Painter of Pennsylvania. Philadelphia: Historical Society of Pennsylvania, 1969. Eichholtz decided to make painting his main vocation. In 1808, Eichholtz advertised that he \\"executes Portraits and Profile paintings\\" in the Lancaster's Intelligencer and Weekly Advertiser. In his own words, \\"I commenced the coppersmith business on my own account, with pretty good luck; still the more agreeable love of painting continually haunted me.\\"Dunlap, William. A History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design in the United States, 3 vols. Volume 2. New York, 1834, p. 385-386. (Reprinted with additions, Boston: C. E. Goodspeed & Co., 1918.) Two already established painters, James Peale and Thomas Sully, influenced Eichholtz. In 1808, James Peale visited Lancaster and became acquainted with Eichholtz, who commissioned Peale his portrait. Thomas Sully befriended Eichholtz when he was visiting Lancaster on business and accepted his invitation to work in his painting room. At that time, Sully was not impressed by Eichholtz's attempts in painting calling them hideous; however, he left him his brushes as a gift before leaving Lancaster. Later, Sully wrote that he was surprised and gratified to see how much Eichholtz's painting skills improved, and that, \\"Eichholtz would have made a first-rate painter had he began early in life with the usual advantages.\\" During the winter of 1811‚Äì1812, Eichholtz traveled to Boston where he spent several weeks at the studio of Gilbert Stuart copying his works under Stuart's supervision. Stuart encouraged Eichholtz to continue painting. In 1815, Eichholtz sold his business and turned to painting. In 1820, he visited Baltimore to fulfill portrait commissions; he also worked in Pittsburgh and Delaware. In 1823, Eichholtz moved to Philadelphia where he, as he later wrote, faced both, \\"an incessant practice of ten years, and constant employment.\\" He was exhibiting with the Society of Artists at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. ==Later life and death== Eichholtz relocated back to Lancaster in 1830 where he died in 1842. He and his family were originally interred at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church on South Duke Street in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. In the early 1850s, Holy Trinity Church sought to expand its churchyard, so the church relocated the majority of gravestones and the remains to the new Woodward Hill Cemetery, Lot 33 of Area B, including the remains of Eichholtz and his family. Eichholtz was reburied in the same grave together with both of his wives and their children. By 2014, Eichholtz's gravestone, which was made of marble, had deteriorated due to age and acid rain, rendering the inscription illegible. Local historians have called for the restoration of his headstone, as well as the installation of a brass plaque at the grave site to mark his achievements. ==Recognition== For decades the artistic legacy of Jacob Eichholtz was overlooked.Richardson, E. P. Portraits by Jacob Eichholtz (1776-1842), Art in America, v. 27: 1939, 14-22. As time passed, a reassessment of the significance of his achievements took place and \\"his portraits of Thaddeus Stevens and James Buchanan are generally accepted as the best that were done of these statesmen.\\"Edgar P. Richardson, Director, Detroit Institute of Arts. Jacob Eichholtz: Introduction, Pennsylvania History, vol. 26, No. 2, April 1959. ==GalleryReferencesFurther reading== *Hensel, W. U.

Voters elected 500 new deputies (300 by their respective constituencies, 200 by proportional representation) to sit in the Chamber of Deputies for the 61st Congress. ==Opinion Polling== Opinion polling, by pollster Demotecnia, that was taken less than a month before the election showed the Institutional Revolutionary Party with 36%, the National Action Party with 31%, and the Party of the Democratic Revolution with 16%.http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1905313,00.html ==Voto en blanco== A none of the above movement, dubbed \\"voto en blanco\\", or \\"blank vote\\", had arisen in response to the perceived corruption of the three major parties running in this election. Starting as a small group on blogs and YouTube, the movement had expanded its ranks, with politicians and intellectuals, such as Jose Antonio Crespo, supporting the movement. Pollster Demotecnia showed that 3% of the people would be willing to boycott the elections in response to the \\"voto en blanco\\" movement. Opposition to the movement came from organizations such as the Federal Electoral Institute, a government institute who seeks to expand voter participation, who claimed that the response to an unsatisfactory democracy is not to have fewer people vote but to have more people involved in the electoral process. ==Results References == Legislative election Category:Elections in Mexico 2009 election Category:July 2009 events in Mexico es:Elecciones federales de M√©xico de 2009 nl:Algemene Mexicaanse verkiezingen 2009 ","title":"2009 Mexican legislative election"},{"id":"20464442","text":"The Portuguese legislative election of 2009 was held on 27 September, to renew all 230 members of the Assembly of the Republic.http://www.mherrera.org/elections.htm The Socialist Party, led by incumbent Prime Minister Jos√© S√≥crates, won the largest number of seats, but didn't repeat the overall majority they gained in 2005.. The Socialist Party of Prime Minister Jos√© S√≥crates came in first despite losing 9% of the vote and 24 seats. In these elections there were approximately 9.5 million Portuguese at home and abroad called to determine the 230 seats in the Assembleia da Rep√∫blica and 18th constitutional government in Portugal after 1976. The Socialists won the election with a clear lead over the conservative Social Democrats, with big gains for the People's Party and for the Left Bloc. The election took place during the regular end of the previous four-year legislative period. From 2005 to 2009 ruled by the Socialist Party (PS), led by Jos√© S√≥crates, with an absolute majority. The opinion polls at the beginning of the official election campaign on 12 September 2009, showed a too close to call race between the Socialists and the conservative Social Democrats,. but just days before the election the Socialists increased their lead over the Social Democrats.. A total of 13 parties and two coalitions competed in this election. Focus of the campaign was the impact of global economic, the financial crisis and the construction of new infrastructure projects, including the high-speed rail link Lisbon-Madrid and Lisbon-Porto- Vigo, and the new Lisbon airport. Neither of the two major parties won an absolute majority in the Assembly of the Republic, so, the future prime minister had to form a coalition, or at least rely on other parties to govern. In that case, Jos√© S√≥crates was in a better position than Manuela Ferreira Leite, since the Portuguese left won by 54.23% of the vote and 128 seats, against 39.54% and 102 deputies to the right. On 12 October, Jos√© S√≥crates was invited by President An√≠bal Cavaco Silva to form government. The new cabinet was announced on 22 October and sworn in on 26 October. Voter turnout was one of the lowest in Portuguese election history, as 59.7% of the electorate cast a ballot. == Background == In the February 2005 early elections, the Socialists, under the leadership of Jos√© S√≥crates, won 45% of the votes and 121 MPs, the 1st time the Socialists won a majority and the 1st time a single party won a majority since Cavaco Silva's PSD victory in 1991. The PSD suffered a heavy defeat, achieving their worst results since 1983, and faced with this failure, the then PSD leader and outgoing Prime Minister, Pedro Santana Lopes, resigned from the leadership and called an election for party chair. In the party's congress in April 2005, Lu√≠s Marques Mendes became party leader winning 56% of the delegates, against the 44% of his rival, Lu√≠s Filipe Menezes.. During the first months in his government, S√≥crates raised taxes to cut the deficit and initiated a policy of strict budgetary rigor. At the same time, he faced a very harsh summer with Wildfires across the country.. That same October, the Socialists suffered a heavy defeat in the 2005 local elections, winning just 108 cities, a drop of 4, against the PSD's 158 mayoral holds. The PS was also unable to retake control of Lisbon and Porto. In January 2006, a new President was elected. An√≠bal Cavaco Silva, PM between 1985-1995, became the first center-right candidate to win a presidential election, although only just. The PS candidate, former PM and President M√°rio Soares polled a disappointing third place with just 14% of the votes. In 2007, a referendum for the legalization of abortion was held. After the failure of the 1998 referendum, the Yes side prevailed winning 59% of the votes against the No's 41%, making abortion legal in Portugal.. While the deficit reduction had been successful, and with the economy growing above 2% of GDP, the government faced heavy opposition for its policies, particularly from teachers unions. In March 2008, more than 100,000 teachers protested in Lisbon against S√≥crates and his Education minister, Maria de Lurdes Rodrigues.. At the same time, the Social Democrats (PSD) were in internal crisis. The then PSD leader, Lu√≠s Filipe Menezes, elected in September 2007, resigned after just 6 months in the job.. In the following leadership elections, held on May 2008, Manuela Ferreira Leite became the first woman to lead a major party in Portugal, winning 38% of the votes, against the 31% of Pedro Passos Coelho and the 30% of Pedro Santana Lopes.. Entering 2009, Portugal was strongly hit by the effects of the financial crisis that was shaking the global economy, and, therefore, the country entered in a recession. As a result, the government adopted stimulus measures that worsened the public finances and increased the deficit and the debt. In the European elections of June 7, 2009, the PSD stunned pundits by winning a European election for the first time since 1989, with 31.7% of the votes. The Socialists suffered a huge defeat, winning just 26% of the votes, a drop of 18%. == Electoral system == The Assembly of the Republic has 230 members elected to four-year terms. Governments do not require absolute majority support of the Assembly to hold office, as even if the number of opposers of government is larger than that of the supporters, the number of opposers still needs to be equal or greater than 116 (absolute majority) for both the Government's Programme to be rejected or for a motion of no confidence to be approved. The number of seats assigned to each district depends on the district magnitude. The use of the d'Hondt method makes for a higher effective threshold than certain other allocation methods such as the Hare quota or Sainte-Lagu√´ method, which are more generous to small parties.Gallaher, Michael (1992). \\"Comparing Proportional Representation Electoral Systems: Quotas, Thresholds, Paradoxes and Majorities\\" == Parties == The parties that partook in the election, and their leaders, were: *Left Bloc (BE), Francisco Lou√ß√£ *Democratic Unity Coalition (CDU), Jer√≥nimo de Sousa *Socialist Party (PS), Jos√© S√≥crates *Social Democratic Party (PSD), Manuela Ferreira Leite *People's Party (CDS‚ÄìPP), Paulo Portas Jos√© S√≥crates, leader of the Socialist Party, was nominated Prime Minister for a 2nd consecutive term. ==Campaign periodParty slogans=== {  style=\\"font- size:97%; text-align:left;\\" - ! style=\\"text-align:left;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Party or alliance !

William Holmes stood for the Labour Party.The Times, 10 February 1920 ==The \\"Coupon\\" revisited== Hotchkin quickly received the endorsement of both the prime minister and the leader of the Conservative Party, Bonar Law. In his letter to Hotchkin, Lloyd George emphasised the need to resuscitate and develop British agriculture in which task he said Hotchkin as a ‚Äòpractical farmer‚Äô would be able to help the government. Bonar-Law stressed the continuing need for parties to work together in the national interest in difficult times.The Times, 19 February 1920 In effect Hotchkin was receiving the equivalent of the government ‚Äòcoupon‚Äô which had been issued at the 1918 general election. ==IssuesAgriculture=== Agriculture dominated the election in this rural constituency. Labour had hopes of picking up the votes of the agricultural workers who were members of the National Union of Agricultural Workers, but William Holmes was reported as alienating potential supporters by making speeches about revolution and bloodshed. It was expected that the Liberals would gain land workers‚Äô votes put off by the apparent extremism of Holmes‚Äô electioneering. While the Coalition government was losing popularity across the country, it was reported that Hotchkin was a strong local candidate who knew about farming from a practical point of view.The Times, 23 February 1920 In the post-war environment, the availability and price of food and of animal feed were also issues.The Times, 25 February 1920 All the candidates strongly supported the encouragement and development of small holdings. Hotchkin was a sometime Chairman of the Lindsey Small Holdings Committee Who was Who, OUP 2007 ===Government influence=== A related concern was government influence over private life and business, through over-regulation and bureaucracy, as well as examples of waste and extravagance from an administration in far away London. This theme was taken up by the Liberal, who also attacked Labour for their plans for nationalisation. ==Result== The declaration of the poll did not take place until 9 March 1920 because of the government‚Äôs continuing to keep in force a wartime regulation delaying the announcement of election results.The Times, 2 March 1920 By this time news of H H Asquith's by-election win in Paisley had become known and this encouraged the Liberals to hope for a good result at Horncastle. In the event, however, the seat was held for the Coalition by Hotchkin with a majority of 1,413 over Pattinson, with Labour in third place. Turnout was 77.1% as opposed to 68.2% at the previous general election, which had been a straight fight between Unionist Coalitionist and Liberal candidates.C Cook & J Ramsden, By-elections in British politics; UCL Press 1077, p271 ==Candidates‚Äô reaction== All three candidates were able to draw a positive conclusion from the result. Hotchkin was clearly gratified to have won and credited his success to a combination of popular satisfaction with the Coalition government and his status as a local man. Pattinson blamed his lack of success on the intervention of a Labour candidate, splitting the anti-coalition vote and presumably hoping Labour‚Äôs third place would discourage them from standing a candidate at future elections. Holmes said he had done well, coming late into the contest a perfect stranger to the constituency and was pleased to have established a solid Labour movement there.The Times, 10 March 1920 Hotchkin took his seat in the House of Commons on Friday 12 March 1920. He served as MP for Horncastle until 1922 when Pattison won the seat at that year‚Äôs general election. ==Aftermath== The intervention of the Labour party was not viewed as a success as they chose not to contest the seat at the 1922 general election. At this election, the new Unionist MP retired and Pattinson gained the seat for the Liberals. Labour avoided running a candidate again until 1929 when their candidate took enough votes off the Liberals to allow the Unionists to win again. ==References== Category:1920 elections in the United Kingdom Category:1920 in England Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Lincolnshire constituencies ","title":"1920 Horncastle by-election"},{"id":"20464498","text":"General elections were held in Saint Kitts and Nevis on 25 January 2010 for eleven of the fourteen or fifteen seats in the National Assembly. The other three or four members of the National Assembly will be appointed by the Governor-General after the elections. The ruling Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP), led by Prime Minister Denzil Douglas, won a fourth term in office. It was opposed in the campaign by the opposition People's Action Movement (PAM), led by Lindsay Grant. Both parties received much of their support from the island of Saint Kitts, which chooses eight of the eleven elected members of the National Assembly. On the neighboring island of Nevis, local parties, including the Nevis Reformation Party (NRP) and the Concerned Citizens' Movement (CCM), vied for three seats in the National Assembly. Support from Nevisian political parties could decide control of the national government in a tight election. The continuing economic crisis was a major issue in the campaign. The national debt of Saint Kitts and Nevis had risen to US$2 billion under the SKNLP government, roughly $50,000 per citizen. Prime Minister Denzil Douglas shrugged off accusations that he had let the debt spiral upward during his fifteen years in office: :\\"It is important for me to state that St. Kitts and Nevis has never missed any payments on the national debt under Labour. This is very important. Many countries owe less, but are repeatedly unable to service their debt.\\" ==Background== Before the 2010 election, the Labour Party controlled seven of the eight seats allocated to the island of Saint Kitts in the Assembly. The opposition People's Action Movement (PAM) controlled the other Saint Kitts seat. From nearby Nevis, the Concerned Citizens' Movement (CCM) controlled two of Nevis' three seats in the Assembly, while the opposition Nevis Reformation Party (NRP) controlled the other seat. Prime Minister Douglas, speaking to a crowd of approximately 15,000 in Basseterre on 9 January 2010, announced the dates for the upcoming election. He set Nomination Day for 15 January 2010, with the general election to be held on 25 January. ==Conduct== Armed police had to respond to protests alleging voting irregularities in the constituency where the PAM leader Lindsay Grant was up against Glen \\"Ghost\\" Phillips of the SKNLP. PAM supporters contended that \\"outsiders\\" were being brought into the Half Way Tree Community Centre, seven miles (11 km) from the capital Basseterre, to vote.. Elsewhere in the country, voting was reported to be calm \\"amidst overcast skies following some intermittent morning showers.\\" ==Results== On Saint Kitts, the SKNLP won six out of the eight seats. The PAM gained a new National Assembly member, Eugene Hamilton, while PAM deputy leader Shawn Richards retained his seat. Prime Minister Denzil Douglas retained his seat for Constituency Six by a margin of 1905 votes to 179. On Nevis, the Concerned Citizens' Movement (CCM) won two seats, with the Nevis Reformation Party (NRP) taking the third. == References == Saint Kitts Category:Elections in Saint Kitts and Nevis Category:2010 in Saint Kitts and Nevis ","title":"2010 Saint Kitts and Nevis general election"},{"id":"20464517","text":"Hibriten High School (HHS) is a comprehensive, four-year high school accredited by the NC Department of Public Instruction and the Southern Colleges and Schools. The school is nestled at the foot of Hibriten Mountain, located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Lenoir, North Carolina. ==History Hibriten Academy === The Hibriten Academy was founded in 1885 on the Wildwood Road. It was a larger school than most of the ones for that period of time as it had three teachers and students of all ages. The rooms were heated with pot-bellied stoves, and the boy students had to cut the wood to keep the fires going. Water was carried to the rooms in a bucket and the students had their own cup to pour the water into from the bucket. Hibriten Academy was consolidated with Kings Creek High at the end of the 1932 school term.Adapted from an article by Irene Beach Bentley in The Heritage of Caldwell County as found in John Hawkins' book The Most American Thing: A History of Education in Caldwell County, North Carolina === Building and construction of Hibriten High School === Following a survey of the schools of Caldwell County in 1963, the State Department of Public Instruction recommended that three of the rural schools‚ÄîOak Hill, King's Creek, and Happy Valley‚Äîbe consolidated. It was also recommended that a new building be constructed on a new site for the consolidated high school. Thirty-five acres of land, located in the Lower Creek section of the county, were purchased at a cost of $37,500. In 1962, an architect was employed for a period of two years to complete plans for the building. Designed in a plan similar to a split- level building, the school consists of three levels and contains departments in science, home economics, English, French, math, social studies, music, physical education, drama, child care center, and vocational studies which include technical drafting, business, introduction to vocations, agriculture, carpentry, graphics, electronics, bricklaying, and the work study programs of industrial cooperative training and distributive education. The building also includes administrative offices for the principal, assistant principal, secretary, guidance suite, visual air room, two first-aid rooms, and a conference room. The cafeteria seats 250 people. Located at the foot of the Hibriten Mountain, the school was given the name of Hibriten High School. Its mascot is a panther, and the school colors are red, black, and white. It is located two miles from the main thoroughfare of the city of Lenoir. The school was officially opened in the fall of 1966 with Kenneth A. Roberts as principal and Ronald Beane as assistant principal. Student enrollment for the 1966-67 school term was 715, with a faculty of 42. The class of 1967 graduated 118 students. Five elementary schools send students to Hibriten High School. The gymnasium and music building were completed in 1972 with the gym seating 1800 people.Adapted from The Communicator June 1975 as found in The Most American Thing: A History of Education in Caldwell County, North Carolina by John Hawkins ==School bands== The Hibriten High School Symphonic Band is the main band of the school. It was established in 1966. As of Spring 2017, the bands (both symphonic and concert bands) have accumulated fifty-three superior ratings (21 consecutive by the symphonic band from 1994 to 2014), with most of them in Grade VI music (the most difficult level). Of note are the band directors who taught at Hibriten and who are now in the North Carolina Bandmaster's Hall of Fame. These include George Kirsten (George Kirsten's sister Dorothy Kirsten sang operatic mezzo-soprano in the NY Metropolitan Opera), and Camilla Graeber. Other HHS Band directors have been honored by the Northwest District of the NC Bandmasters Association including Dennis Carswell, John Craig, and Bill Witcher. ==School songs== The fight song was written by Captain Ralph Ostrom.

The elections were the seventh to be held for membership of the Estates since autonomy was granted by the Dutch in 1986, and resulted in a victory for the Aruban People's Party, which won 12 of the 21 seats in the Estates. ==Background== Prior to this election the People's Electoral Movement (MEP) were the governing party, holding eleven seats. The main opposition Aruban People's Party (AVP) held eight with the Network of Electoral Democracy and the Aruban Patriotic Movement holding a seat apiece. ==Electoral system== The 21 members of the Estates were elected for a four-year term using proportional representation, carried out in a single nationwide constituency. Each party was allowed to place up to 29 people on their party list. The party or coalition with a majority was allowed to select a Prime Minister. ==Campaign== Eight parties and 167 independents contested the elections. The Aruban Director of the Register of Population and electoral council member Sharline Luidens forbade the press from taking photos inside polling stations during the election. Pre-election polls showed the AVP were expected to win, campaigning to reduce inflation and abolish a tax on local business. The AVP also pledged to address concerns over the island's oil refinery operated by Valero Energy, which had been closed since mid-July 2009 and had provided jobs for around one thousand people, as well as a recent decline in tourists visiting the island. The People's Electoral Movement (MEP) pledged to diversify the economy and reduce debt and living costs. The parties were represented by specific colors during the campaign; the AVP was known as the \\"green party,\\" the MEP was the \\"yellow party\\" and the independent Real Democracy Party was identified as the \\"red party.\\" ==Results== { class= style=text-align:right !Party !Votes !% !Seats !+/‚Äì - align=leftAruban People's Party26,47648.0312+4 - align=leftPeople's Electoral Movement19,80435.938‚Äì3 - align=leftAruban Patriotic Movement2,4444.430‚Äì1 - align=leftReal Democracy Party3,1445.701+1 - align=leftNetwork2,3784.310‚Äì1 - align=leftAruban Patriotic Party6111.1100 - align=leftUnited Christians Reinforcing Aruba's Potential1390.250New - align=leftMSI‚ÄìOLA1250.2300 - align=leftInvalid/blank votes629‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì - align=leftTotal55,750100210 - align=leftRegistered voters/turnout64,60286.30‚Äì‚Äì - align=left colspan=5Source: Government of Aruba } A turnout of 86% was recorded for the election which proceeded without disruption. Governor Fredis Refunjol and his wife, Clarette, voted at the Sacred Heart School in Savaneta early Friday morning and urged all Arubans to vote as well. Incumbent Prime Minister Nelson Oduber and his wife, Glenda, cast their ballots at the EPB School in Hato, on the edge of Oranjestad. AVP leader Mike Eman voted in the afternoon at the Colegio Arubano, a junior-senior high school, with his wife, Doina, and his brother, Henny Eman, who was Aruba's first Prime Minister. Doina Eman, who is originally from the United States, had recently acquired her Dutch passport and this was the first Aruban election in which she was eligible to vote. Polls closed in Aruba at 7:00 pm local time. Early results began filtering in approximately 8:30 pm. The first results reported in were from the Noord District, which showed a marked support for the AVP. Twelve election precincts in Oranjestad, the capital, were also won by the AVP early in the evening. The AVP, which is identified by the color green, also won eight polling stations in San Nicolas, the site of the recently closed Valero Energy oil refinery. Support declined for Nelson Obuder's MEP party across the island. The MEP, which is known as the \\"yellow party\\", captured its traditional stronghold of Santa Cruz, as well as precincts in portions of Savaneta and Paradera. Support for the MEP ultimately dropped from eleven to eight seats in the Estates. The AVP, led by Mike Eman, claimed 48% of the vote and twelve seats in the Estates, making Eman the 5th Prime Minister-Elect of Aruba with an absolute majority of three seats in the 21-seat House. The MEP won 36% of the vote and eight seats, with the final seat being won by the Real Democracy Party. This meant that Nelson Oduber, the demissionary Prime Minister of Aruba, had lost control of the Estates for the first time in eight years. Eman arrived at the AVP party headquarters in Oranjestad, where he was greeted by approximately 2,000 supporters dressed in green, the color of the AVP. The victory was marked by AVP supporters letting off fireworks and unfurling flags in the green livery of the party. In his speech, Eman thanked Aruba's Latino and Haitian communities. The winning party of an Aruban election traditionally celebrates with a parade following the election. ==Reactions== Oduber blamed the MEP's defeat on Dutch interference in Aruba's affairs, in particular referring to a recent announcement that the Dutch authorities would commence an investigation into corruption on the island. Oduber also singled out Valero Energy CEO Bill Klesse, accusing him of taking sides in the election against the MEP by closing the refinery shortly before the election took place. In a speech carried only on Aruban Channel 22, Oduber did not congratulate the winning AVP. Instead, he said that the AVP should work to fulfill its \\"unreal promise\\" to Arubans. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Aruba Press: AVP Triumphant - Aruba has a New Government *Real Democracy Party 2009 campaign site General election Category:2009 elections in the Caribbean 2009 ","title":"2009 Aruban general election"},{"id":"20464528","text":"HVAC Testing, Adjusting and Balancing (TAB) are the three major steps used to achieve proper operation of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems. TAB usually refers to commercial building construction and the specialized contractors who employ personnel that perform this service. In general, the TAB specialist performs air and hydronic measurements on the HVAC systems and adjusts the flows as required to achieve optimum performance of the building environmental equipment. The balancing is usually based upon the design flow values required by the Mechanical Engineer for the project, and the TAB contractor submits a written report which summarizes the testing and balancing and notes any deficiencies found during the TAB work. Many times facility managers will use a TAB contractor to assist in identifying preexisting or common issues with a facility. While not necessary to be a TAB contractor, many contractors tend to hold professional air balancing certifications. Some certifying agencies, such as AABC, require that the certified contractor is Independent. That is, all AABC TAB agencies can only be testing and balancing contractors. This eliminates a situation where the system installer can also perform the Testing and Balancing. ==Testing== Testing is the use of specialized and calibrated instruments to measure temperatures, pressures, rotational speeds, electrical characteristics, velocities, and air and water quantities for an evaluation of equipment and system performance. ==Adjusting== Adjusting is the final setting of balancing devices such as dampers and valves, adjusting fan speeds and pump impeller sizes, in addition to automatic control devices such as thermostats and pressure controllers to achieve maximum specified system performance and efficiency during normal operation. ==Balancing== Balancing is the methodical regulation of system fluid flows (air or water) through the use of acceptable procedures to achieve the desired or specified design airflow or water flow. When beginning the balance of a system, you must locate the terminal with the least amount of flow in regards to the engineer's drawing. Once the \\"low\\" terminal has been located, you can then proceed to adjust all other diffusers/grilles (air) or circuit balancing valves (water) to proportionally match the original \\"low\\" terminal. There must be at least one terminal that is wide open to achieve optimum efficiency. ==References== Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning ","title":"Testing, adjusting, balancing"},{"id":"20464542","text":"The Arboretum de Segrez is a historic arboretum located within the Domaine de Segrez on Rue Alphonse Lavall√©e, Saint-Sulpice-de-Favi√®res, Essonne, √éle-de- France, France.

Listed at , 195 lb., Murff batted and threw right-handed. He attended Gettysburg College. A native of Burlington, Texas, Murff started his professional baseball career in A and AA ball. On June 8, , while pitching for the Texas City Texans, he threw a no-hitter against the Harlingen Capitals. A year later he pitched 19‚Öî innings of a 20-inning game, in a lost cause against the Texarkana Bears, who defeated the Texans, 3‚Äì2. Then, in 1955 was selected both the Minor League Player of the Year by The Sporting News and Texas League Pitcher of the Year after going 27‚Äì11 for the Dallas Eagles. Murff entered the majors in 1956 with the Braves as a 35-year-old rookie, having been signed by Milwaukee scout Earle W. Halstead. In a story chronicled in Murff's biography \\"The Scout\\", Halstead negotiated with Dick Burnett, owner of the Dallas Eagles in the Texas League, where Murff played. The two sides reached an impasse until Halstead proposed a game of gin rummy with the winner setting the terms of the trade. Halstead won and the Braves paid Burnett $40,000 and three players from the 40 man roster to obtain Murff's contract. In part of two seasons, he posted a 2‚Äì2 record with a 4.65 ERA and three saves in 26 appearances, including two starts, giving up 26 earned runs on 56 hits and 18 walks while striking out 31 in 50 ‚Öì innings of work. Following his majors career, Murff coached in the minors and managed the 1960 Jacksonville Braves of the South Atlantic League. As a scout for the New York Mets, he discovered and signed future Hall of Famer pitcher Nolan Ryan and All-Star catcher Jerry Grote. Ryan, later named president of the Texas Rangers, noted his friendship with Murff in his 1999 Hall of Fame induction speech. In the early 1970s, Murff helped start the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor baseball program, and retired to Tyler, Texas in 1991 after serving 34 years as a scout. He was inducted into the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Texas Scouts Association Hall of Fame in 1999, and in 1994 the UMHB's ballpark was named in his honour, Red Murff Field.

The rest are \\"elected\\" by the functional \\"constituencies\\" or appointed by the Chief Executive. == The pro-democracy lists == This year, there are four lists advocating universal suffrage and political reforms. In both 2001 and 2005, the New Democratic Macau Association, also referred as the democrats by local media, received the highest number of votes. Due to the divisors (1,2,4,8,...) employed in the highest averages method, they only managed to win 2 seats on both occasions (they would have achieved 3 seats had the original d'Hondt formula been used instead).

However, the list of Angela Leong has ignored this ruling and continued to display political posters in Grand Lisboa, a casino owned by STDM.http://pontofinalmacau.wordpress.com/2009/09/17/candidatura-de-angela- leong-usa-casinos-para-fazer-campanha/ == Macanese candidates == A unified list consisting of mainly candidates with Portuguese descent (Macanese), some born in Macau and others in Portugal, contests in this legislative election, under the name Voz Plural - Gentes de Macau. The list also has Chinese members. The platform calls for the protection of the heritage of Macau in a modern context of multiculturalism.http://pontofinalmacau.wordpress.com/2009/07/14/voz-plural- sonha-com-assembleia- maiorhttp://www.lusa.pt/lusaweb/user/showitem?service=310&listid;=NewsList310&listpage;=1&docid;=9852068 One of the main issue they campaign for is to protect rights of foreign workers in RAEM, in bid to win votes from the sizeable Philippines and Indonesian communities. Voz Plural is the only list which campaigns in roughly equal proportions in Chinese, Portuguese and Englishhttp://www.hojemacau.com/news.phtml?id=36135&today;=27-08-2009&type;=politics (see below). The top two candidates of Nova Esperan√ßa, Jos√© Pereira Coutinho and Rita Santos, are both Macanese. However, unlike Voz Plural, Nova Esperan√ßa concentrates on issues of labour rights and social issues. The outgoing deputy Jos√© Pereira Coutinho has proposed, but without success, the trade union bill twice during his time in the assembly so far. Both lists support gradual political reforms and increasing the number of directly elected deputies in AL. However, their programs are less ambitious than the pro-democracy lists. In particular, Voz Plural does not campaign for universal suffrage according to their manifesto, due to a perception that such claim is not realistic for the next 4 years, proposing instead the increase of directly elected members from 12 to 18.http://202.175.81.246/safp/pp/2009PP14.pdf == Languages == There is no restriction on the choice of language used in the campaigns. Traditionally, candidates concentrate on winning votes from the Chinese majority. With the participation of Voz Plural, more efforts are being made to translate manifestos into minority languages this year. For the first time, ANMD (and APMD) will make use of its campaign air time on the Portuguese channel of TDM.http://www.hojemacau.com/news.phtml?id=36134&today;=27-08-2009&type;=politics Uni√£o Promotora para o Progresso (UPP) also campaigns in both Chinese and Portuguese. Associa√ß√£o de Apoio √† Comunidade e Proximidade do Povo (AACPP), Observat√≥rio C√≠vico and Voz Plural all campaigns in three languages (Chinese, Portuguese and English). AACPP even sends out leaflets in Braille.http://www.hojemacau.com/news.phtml?id=36133&today;=27-08-2009&type;=politics The use of Portuguese became an important election issue this year. During a debate between the two leading Macanese candidates, Casimiro Pinto and Jos√© Pereira Coutinho, organised by Ponto Final, discrimination against monoglot Portuguese was discussed.http://pontofinalmacau.wordpress.com/2009/09/07/debate-querer-o- mesmo-com-estilos-opostos/ Apart from Voz Plural, Alian√ßa Pr‚Äôa Mudan√ßa also supports multilingualism. Their education policies include promoting bilingual (Chinese and Portuguese) teaching in Macau. UPP also supports bilingualism favouring stronger ties with other lusophone trading partners.http://www.hojemacau.com/news.phtml?id=36405&today;=15-09-2009&type;=politics == Controversies  UPP's false start === Uni√£o Promotora Para o Progresso (UPP), a list associated to the Kaifong association, has breached election regulations by distributing campaign materials outside the legal campaign period (5 to 18 September).http://www.hojemacau.com/news.phtml?today=03-09-2009&type;=politics On 20 August, Au Kam San of the ANMD made an official complaint to the electoral commission after UPP distributed leaflets on the street and published campaign advertisements with pictures of the UUP candidates in a local magazine, Uni√£o Geral das Associa√ß√µes de Moradores de Macau.http://pontofinalmacau.wordpress.com/2009/09/03/boletim-dos-kaifong-e- legal-mas-inadequado/ The said magazine was published with subsidies from Funda√ß√£o Macau. The democrats accused Funda√ß√£o Macau of financing \\"illegal\\" campaigns using public funds. However, the president of the electoral commission, Vasco Fong, ruled that the actions of UUP were due to ignorance and refused to punish the list. === Internet war === There have been reports that some candidates received malicious emails containing a virus that would delete all the data of victims' computers. Observat√≥rico C√≠vico claimed that they received tens of such messages.http://pontofinalmacau.wordpress.com/2009/09/18/factos-da-campanha/ Many rumours have been spread on various internet forums. Many accusations were made against the democrats on the CTM forums, including claims of Au Kam San's link to Falun Gong. === Smears against Kwan Tsui Hang === Anonymous posters were displayed throughout the city making false accusations against the outgoing deputy and the leader of Uni√£o Para o Desenvolvimento, Kwan Tsui Hang. The posters claimed that Kwan was against government's recent cash relief scheme and would rather allocate the funds for corruption purposes. Kwan has denied all such claims. Despite having complained to the election commission, the posters continued to appear on the streets asserting people were making the wrong choice (for electing Kwan).http://pontofinalmacau.wordpress.com/2009/09/14/kwan-tsui-hang-diz-se- alvo-de-campanha- difamatoria/http://pontofinalmacau.wordpress.com/2009/09/17/kwan-tsui-hang- acredita-na-eleicao-de-dois-deputados/ == Ballot and Results == There are in total 16 lists, down 2 from 2005. In one form or another, 9 lists have contested in the 2005 election. The ballot order was announced on 29 July. The election commissioner delayed the announcement of the final results after recording a large number of spoilt votes. On the first count, there were 6,539 spoilt votes, but 5,467 of them have been validated on the recount.http://pontofinalmacau.wordpress.com/2009/09/23/recontagem-nao-altera- mandatos/ Melinda Chan, the leading candidate of Alian√ßa Pr'a Mudan√ßa, immediately filed a complaint against the decision arguing that according to electoral law, a tick should be put inside the designated box for the vote to be valid. On 28 September, the court of last repeal (o Tribunal de √öltima Inst√¢ncia) ruled in favour of Melinda Chan and concluded that only 41 of the original spoilt votes should be valid. The ruling does not change the overall outcome of the election with the 12 original elected deputies remaining elected, but there is a slight change in the \\"ranking\\" of the lists.http://pontofinalmacau.wordpress.com/2009/09/29/tui-da-razao-a-melinda- chan/http://www.eal.gov.mo/2009/media/finalResult/EALRpt_001.jpg The strategies of the democrats paid off, they managed to increase 1 seat which means there will be 4 pro-democracy deputies (including Jos√© Pereira Coutinho) in the new assembly. The traditionalists lost one seat despite both UPP and UPD increased their number of votes. In fact, UPD received the largest number of votes as a single list and saw the largest increase in votes. For the pro- business camp, there remain 5 deputies, 4 of which from the gaming industry. Analysts pointed out that there has not been a huge change in the make up of the AL which continues to be dominated by the pro-Beijing camp.http://www.hojemacau.com/news.phtml?id=36518&today;=22-09-2009&type;=politics ==Candidates lists and results Turnout== 28 polling stations were open from 9am to 9pm.

In Queensland, for the government to serve a full-term, an election will be held approximately three years following the previous election. In Queensland, Section 80 of the Electoral Act 1992 states that an election must be held on a Saturday; and that the election campaign must run for a minimum of 26 or a maximum of 56 days following the issue of the writs. Five to seven days following the issue of the writs, the electoral roll is closed, which gives voters a final opportunity to enrol or to notify the Electoral Commission of Queensland of any changes in their place of residence.Electoral Act 1992 == Legislative Assembly == :See also: 2006 election pendulum and maps, Candidates of the Queensland state election, 2009 The Labor Party, led by Premier Anna Bligh, and the LNP, led by Opposition Leader Lawrence Springborg, were the two main parties in Queensland at the election. It was the first election contested by the LNP following its creation with the merger of the National and Liberal parties. At the previous election, Labor won 59 seats, the Nationals won 17 seats, the Liberals won eight seats, One Nation won one seat, and independents won four seats. Former Labor MP Ronan Lee joined the Greens in 2008, thus becoming their parliamentary leader. Lee lost his seat at the election. A redistribution saw Labor notionally pick up three seats. Therefore, the LNP notionally needed to pick up 22 seats rather than 20 seats to form a majority government, which equated to an unchanged uniform 8.3 percent two party preferred swing. Former Premier Peter Beattie resigned in September 2007, which triggered the October 2007 Brisbane Central by-election. == Parties contesting the election == {  - ! Party ! Seats Contested (2009) !

The result was a tenth successive victory for the Botswana Democratic Party, which won 45 of the 57 elected seats in the National Assembly. ==Electoral system== The 57 directly-elected members of the National Assembly were elected in single-member constituencies. A further four members were elected from a list nominated by the President, whilst the President and Attorney General became ex officio members.Botswana IFES ==Campaign== The ruling BDP was suffering from internal problems in the build up to the election, with President Ian Khama threatening to expel party leader and former cabinet minister Daniel Kwelagobe, leader of the Barata-Phathi faction within the BDP. Although Khama and Kwelagobe made amends, stability within the BDP remained open to question. The BDP campaign focussed on its record in government, including education, training and economic development. Botswana National Front leader Otsweletse Moupo did not contest the elections after losing the party's primary elections for his Gaborone West North seat. It was speculated that he would try to get his party's nomination in Gaborone South, but ultimately Moupo declined to run. Its campaign centred on creating a strong civil society and improving social welfare and housing. The Botswana Congress Party (BCP) and the Botswana Alliance Movement (BAM) formed an electoral alliance and supported each other's candidates. BCP leader Gilson Saleshando stood for election in Selebi-Phikwe West, a constituency held prior to the election by BDP candidate Kavis Kario. The alliance's campaign included a pledge to stop the economic downturn. The Botswana People's Party (BPP) campaign focussed on agricultural development and manufacturing, whilst the MELS Movement of Botswana (MELS) promised to fight the exploitation of the population.Last Elections IPU A total of 177 candidates contested the elections; 57 from the BDP, 48 from the BNF, 46 from the BCP-BAM alliance (42 from the BCP and 4 from the BAM), 6 from the BPP, 4 from MELS, one from the Botswana Tlhoko Tiro Organisation and 15 independents.Election Results IEC ==Opinion polls== Very few scientific opinion polls were taken prior to the election, preventing accurate measures of public sentiment. { class= style=text-align:right !Date !Institute !BDP !BNF !BCP !Other/none - 28 Sept ‚Äì 16 Oct 2008 University of Botswana Faculty / Afrobarometer 63% 13% 8% 10% } ==Conduct== Early voting was planned for police and polling officers on 29 September, as they would be unable to vote on election day. However, because of a printing error at the Johannesburg-based printer that was responsible for printing the ballot papers, early voting could not proceed as planned; ballot numbers, which should be unique to counter election fraud, were sometimes repeated on the ballots for local elections. As a result Police officers and polling officers had to vote on 16 October, along with the general public. For officers stationed far away from the place they are registered to vote, this presented serious problems. The BCP threatened legal action against the Independent Electoral Commission. Election turnout was reported to be high with polling station opening times being extending to cope with large queues. Election observers stated that the overall process ran smoothly, although in some instance people had been unable to vote. The Southern African Development Community noted that the elections were \\"credible, peaceful, free and fair\\", but raised concerns about the \\"slow polling process\\". ==Results== Nehemiah Modubule, MP for Lobatse, won re- election running as an independent, having been elected in 2004 as a BNF candidate. ==Aftermath== President Khama was sworn in for a second term on 20 October, and a victory rally took place in Gaborone on 18 October. ==See also== *List of members of the National Assembly of Botswana 2009‚Äì2014 ==References== Botswana Category:2009 in Botswana Category:Elections in Botswana ","title":"2009 Botswana general election"}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},F={class:"card-container"};function R(s,a,i,c,u,n){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",F,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(n.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(L,[["render",R]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/33.md","filePath":"people/33.md"}'),I={name:"people/33.md"},x=Object.assign(I,{setup(s){return(a,i)=>(t(),o("div",null,[C(H)]))}});export{E as __pageData,x as default};
