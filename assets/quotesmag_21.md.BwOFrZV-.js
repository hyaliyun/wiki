Born on a farm near Mullins, he was educated at Mullins High School, the University of North Carolina, as well as the University of South Carolina Law School and National Law School in Washington, D.C. He was selected to represent the United States Congress at the Interparliamentary Union in London in 1960, and in Tokyo in 1961. McMillan was elected as a Democrat to the Seventy-sixth and to the sixteen succeeding Congresses, serving from January 3, 1939 to January 3, 1973. He was chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia from 1945 to 1947, from 1949 to 1953, and from 1955 to 1973. He was a signatory to the 1956 Southern Manifesto that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education. As chairman of the District of Columbia Committee, McMillan was primarily responsible for overseeing local matters in the capital; under the Constitution, Congress has ultimate authority over the District. He consistently opposed home rule for the District; no home rule even came up for a vote in his committee, even when they had originally been passed out of the Senate. The lone home rule bill that even reached the House floor during his tenure came in 1965, when the House leadership steered a home rule bill away from McMillan at the urging of the Johnson administration. McMillan opposed the bill, arguing that Washington was \\"the only city created for a federal purpose.\\" Although the bill ultimately didn't pass, the fact it was even brought to the floor at all was seen as a sea change. However, McMillan was not completely opposed to giving D. C. residents greater control over their affairs. For example, in 1967, he sponsored a bill that gave the District an elected school board. McMillan's tenure saw Washington become a majority-minority city, and blacks often claimed he was indifferent to their concerns. When Walter Washington, the Mayor-Commissioner of the District of Columbia, sent his first budget to Congress in late 1967, McMillan responded by having a truckload of watermelons delivered to Washington's office.Harry S. Jaffe and Tom Sherwood. Dream City: Race, Power, and the Decline of Washington D.C. Simon & Schuster, 1994, p.62 McMillan was defeated in the 1972 Democratic primary by a considerably more liberal Democrat, State Representative John Jenrette. McMillan blamed black voters, charging that \\"The colored people were bought out.\\" He is still the longest-serving congressman in South Carolina's history, and only Strom Thurmond and Ernest Hollings represented the state longer at the federal level. He resided in Florence, South Carolina, where he died in 1979; interment was in the McMillan family cemetery, Mullins. ==References== Category:1898 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from South Carolina Category:South Carolina Democrats Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:20th-century American politicians Category:People from Mullins, South Carolina Category:People from Florence, South Carolina Category:National University School of Law alumni ","title":"John L.

The tagline promoting the film was \\"They are living a lie called the Perfect American Family\\". It was shot entirely in Los Angeles. ==Synopsis== Doing Time on Maple Drive centers on the Carter family. Phil (Sikking), the patriarch, is a successful local restaurateur, married for many years to Lisa (Besch). They have three grown children, Karen (Brook), Tim (Carrey) and Matt (McNamara). Karen is married to Tom (Byron), Tim works in his father's restaurant and Matt is a college student. Matt returns from college and introduces the family to his fianc√©e, Allison (Loughlin). Matt is injured after crashing his car; he returns home to recuperate. As he recovers, the family is revealed to be almost completely dysfunctional. Tim is an alcoholic. Matt's car crash was a suicide attempt brought on by the pressure of being gay and closeted from his conservative parents and lying about Allison's breaking their engagement because of it. Lisa is in deep denial about all of the problems family members are facing. Karen's husband Tom learns that Karen is pregnant and that she is so terrified of bringing a child into a family situation like hers that she's considering having an abortion without telling him. Tom angrily confronts his father-in-law Phil, declaring that while Phil may be destroying his own family he won't allow Phil to destroy his. Tom implores Karen not to have the abortion and moves away with her for the baby's sake to get them away from Phil's problems. Matt confronts his parents, including telling his mother that he knows she already knows he is gay after having walked in on him and another boy. Lisa continues to struggle with denial, but Phil begins to take tentative steps toward understanding and building bridges with his family. ==Cast== * James Sikking as Phil Carter * Bibi Besch as Lisa Carter * William McNamara as Matt Carter * Jayne Brook as Karen Carter * Lori Loughlin as Allison * Jim Carrey as Tim Carter * Janice Lynde as Judy * Bodhi Elfman as Joe * David Byron as Tom * Philip Linton as Andy (This actor died one month before this film was released.) * Bennett Cale as Kyle * Richard Israel as Student Actor * Mark Chaet as Nick * George Roth as Dr. Norman * Parker Whitman as Gene * Danielle Michonne as Cindy * Toni Sawyer as Millie * Mike Marikian as Kevin * Courtenay McWhinney as Clara ==Awards and nominations\\"Awards&Nominations;\\".

S√∏r Aukra Municipality existed from 1924 until 1965 when it was merged into Midsund Municipality (now part of Molde Municipality). The municipality consisted of the entire island of Otr√∏ya, the eastern part of Mid√∏ya island, and some small surrounding islands at the entrance to the large Romsdal Fjord. The village of Midsund was the administrative centre of the municipality. ==History== The municipality of S√∏r-Aukra was established on 1 January 1924 when the old Aukra Municipality was divided into S√∏r-Aukra (in the south) and Nord-Aukra (in the north). Initially, S√∏r-Aukra Municipality had a population of 1,395. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1965, S√∏r-Aukra was merged with the island of Dryna and the rest of the island of Mid√∏ya, both from Vatne Municipality, to form the new Midsund Municipality. Prior to the merger, S√∏r-Aukra had a population of 1,912.

Whipple Lake is a man- made lake on that was originally built during the height of the lumber era that swept through Pennsylvania in the late 19th and early 20th century to supply power for a sawmill. Whipple Dam State Park is south of State College, just east of Pennsylvania Route 26. ==History== The land on which Whipple Dam State Park is located was purchased from the Iroquois Confederation in 1754 by the Proprietary Government of Pennsylvania. Eventually the Monroe Iron Works was built on the land and the production of charcoal took place, as well as the mining of iron ore. Remnants of the iron mines can be seen today at the park. The demand for lumber reached northern Huntingdon County in the 1860s. The old-growth forests of white pine and hemlock were harvested from the mountains. Osgood M. Whipple purchased a large tract of land on which he built a sawmill that was powered by the waters of the lake formed by the dam he also constructed. Mr. Whipple left the lumber business in 1897, but the lake remained and has been used for recreation ever since (and is today known as Whipple Lake). The state of Pennsylvania purchased the land on January 15, 1904 from the Linden Hall Lumber Company, which was owned by William Whitmer and his sons. The dam was rebuilt in 1928 by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry, a forerunner of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The land was used recreationally by the 1920s. A camp for Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and Campfire Girls was built on the north side of the lake in 1928 and was used until 1941. The Great Depression of the 1930s was a boom time for the construction of state park facilities all over Pennsylvania and Whipple Dam was no exception. Unemployed young men were put to work by the Civilian Conservation Corps and cleared streams of brush, planted many acres of trees in a reforestation effort, built bridges on state roads and cleared roads through the forests for fire prevention. The CCC also built the facilities that are still in use today at Whipple Dam State Park. In 1935, they dismantled the 1928 dam and built a new one. They also built pavilions, restrooms, roads and the beach. Their work was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Whipple Dam Dam.jpgDam spillway File:Whipple Dam Ranger HQ Huntingdon Co PA.jpgRanger headquarters ==Recreation== Boat tied to a dock on the lake ===Whipple Lake=== Whipple Lake is open to fishing, ice fishing, boating, and swimming. The lake is stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission with trout. Gas powered boats are prohibited on Whipple Lake. Electric powered boats and non powered boats must have current registration with any state. The sand beach opens on Memorial Day weekend and closes Labor Day weekend. There is no lifeguard stationed at the beach. There is a beach volleyball court, bathhouse and snack bar at the beach. The lake provides a habitat for a wide variety of waterfowl as well as great blue heron, osprey, beavers and muskrats. ===Picnics=== There are three large pavilions that were built by Civilian Conservation Corps. These pavilions can be reserved up to 11 months in advance. Pavilions that are not reserved are available on a first come, first served basis. In addition to the pavilions there are many picnic tables in the forested picnic area that is near Whipple Lake. ===Hunting=== Hunting is permitted within certain parts of Whipple Dam State Park. Hunting is not permitted in the day use area. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania State Game Commission. The common game species are ruffed grouse, squirrels, turkey, white-tailed deer, waterfowl, and black bears. The hunting of groundhogs is prohibited. ==Nearby state parks== The following state parks are within of Whipple Dam State Park: Note: shows Whipple Dam State Park *Bald Eagle State Park (Centre County) *Black Moshannon State Park (Centre County) *Greenwood Furnace State Park (Huntingdon County) *Canoe Creek State Park (Blair County) *Penn- Roosevelt State Park (Centre County) *Poe Paddy State Park (Centre County) *Poe Valley State Park (Centre County) *Reeds Gap State Park (Mifflin County) *Trough Creek State Park (Huntingdon County) ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:State parks of Pennsylvania Category:Park buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania Category:Protected areas established in 1928 Category:Civilian Conservation Corps in Pennsylvania Category:Parks in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania Category:National Register of Historic Places in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania Category:Dams on the National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania Category:1928 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Protected areas of Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Whipple Dam State Park"},{"id":"7443971","text":"Durrus is an area of West Cork in Ireland. For earlier history, see Durrus and District History. For later history, see Durrus and District History Modern. ==1700-1800Indictment of Priests 1714=== On 9 April 1714, Fr. Humphrey O'Sullivan P.P. Durrus, Fr. Daniel McCarthy, P.P. Schull, Fr. Teige McCarthy P.P. Caheragh, Fr. George Gould, P.P. Bantry were indicted at the general assizes and gaol delivery at Cork ==Irish Famine of 1740-41== In March 1741 Thomas Prior founder of the RDS said that Sir Thomas Cox of Dunmanway related that due to a failure of the potato crop 500 people had died in his area. Around 350,000 people died including one fifth of Munster's population. It was referred to as Bliain an Air, the year of the slaughter. This famine may have been even more severe than the great famine of 1847 in terms of mortality from starvation and disease. ===Richard Pococke (1704-1765)=== Richard Pococke, Bishop of Ossory, travelled in the South West and in 1758 wrote the following in respect of the Beara area, that this would have a reference to the other peninsulas: :\\"they keep their sheep and black cattle. They can legally send no fish to France but salmon, all the rest goes to Spain\\" :\\"They make huts to keep their cattle in the mountains in Summer, and live on new churn milk\\". :\\"Girls married at the age of thirteen and boys at sixteen\\" :\\"People here live to a great age, notwithstanding they drink drams immoderately, living on fish and potatoes, and the sea air makes this custom less pernicious but them smallpox is very mortal among them, supposed to be owing to the first died. A sort of scurvy also, which sometimes come near to a leprosie, is frequent among them. They have great notions of fairies in all these parts, which take the place of witches in other places. All workmen, though only making a ditch or thrashing, do all sorts of handicraft in a private house or fields, had the shameful custom these parts more than any other, of holding a string or something across the way and begging money.\\" ===Late 18th and early 19th century subsistence agriculture=== In O'Flanagan and Buttimer's work, Cork History and Society they single out the insular peninsular world of Schull- Kilcrohane-Beara as showing a pattern of densely populated clustered settlements with population densities of South East Asian proportions. This was possible due to complex partnership arrangements in the organisation of land use and work rhythms and the use of the spade for cultivation due to a surplus of labour. Joint farming was integral and marine resources of seaweed and marine coral sand was extensively used. In Dunmanus Bay this came from Carbery Island among other places. Seasonal migration to the better farmlands of East Cork and Munster also added to income. In South Kilkenny, Amhloaimh O Suilleabhain (Humphrey O'Sullivan) said that a \\"spailpina bochta\\" could earn 8d. a day and the sickle men \\"lucht corain \\"15d. Added to this widespread sub- division, early marriages, the availability of wasteland, smallpox inoculation and the presence of a cottier textile industry and the contribution of fishing allowed a massive population expansion. Land was let by the 'gneeve' i.e. the grass of one cow or one twelfth of a ploughland. The contribution of the wife by keeping poultry and spinning was important. Between 1766 and 1821 the number of households in the Durrus area increased by 60/69%, the population rose significantly. From the land appropriations of the 1650s and 1660s, to the Rising of 1798 and the Napoleonic Wars there was a long period of peace and prosperity. The gradual introduction of those with expertise and the new technology to improve farming practices, contributed to a prosperity, which engendered rapid population expansion. During this period, South Munster was transformed into a major agricultural area, centred on the Port of Cork. Cork City underwent a phenomenal expansion, with rapid population growth with hinterland immigration and from abroad. Central to its growth was the provisioning of the Royal Navy for what was termed \\"wet goods\\" (dairy products, salted and cured meats). Dry goods for the Royal Navy were provided from East Anglia. Important in securing Royal Navy contracts were London based families with Cork connections, such as the Southwells (also of Kinsale), and descendants of the Boyle/Shannon families, who were influential in official circles at the time. The benefits reached into the furthest peninsulas, old tradition has it that people travelled from Kilcrohane to Cork with butter, and from as far as Dursey in the Beara Peninsula, to Cork with pigs. A considerable amount of the trade would have been sea-borne, in small wooden vessels, to Cork. ===General Charles Vallancey Survey Report 1778=== He was sent to Ireland to assist in a military survey, remained and became an authority on Irish antiquities. He wrote a report on the West Cork area which should also hold true for Durrus at the period, 'there was only one road between Cork and Bantry; you may now proceed by eight carriage roads beside several horse tracks branching off from these great roads, from Bantry the country is mountainous and from the high road has the appearance of being barren and very thinly populated; yet the valleys abound with, corn and potatoes and the mountains are covered with black cattle in 1760, twenty years ago it was so thinly inhabited an army of 10,000 men could not possible have found subsistence between Bantry and Bandon. The face of the country now wears a different aspect: the sides of the hill are under the plough, the verges of the bogs are reclaimed and the southern coast from Skibbereen to Bandon is one continued garden of grain and potatoes except the barren pinnacles of some hills and the boggy hollows between which are preserved for fuel' (Original in British Library) ==1800-1900Cholera 1832=== It struck Cork in April 1832 and in the city nearly 500 died in the fever hospital, Skibbereen was deserted, the wife of the Protestant Curate of Schull Rev. O'Neill was dead within ten hours. There was a further outbreak in early 1849, casualties usually were half of those affected, 82 died in Bantry. ===Anti-Tithe Meeting Mount Gabriel, April 1832.=== In the pre-reformation period tithes were a voluntary offering to the clergy in thanks for their work. It was divided in three, one third was for to provide education for all the poor and youth in the parish, one third to provide for the needs of the impoverished and the balance for the upkeep of the church. This was written By D√°ibh√≠ de Barra in an account of a tithe affray at Rossmore Strand, Carrightohill. After the Reformation the tithes went to the Protestant clergy and it was also levied on crops not on grassland. A monster meeting was held at the base of Mount Gabriel to protest against tithes attended by tithe payers from Schull, Kilmoe and Durrus. Many Protestants and Methodists attended. The men of Durrus were under the command of Richard O‚ÄôDonovan of Tullagh accompanied by the Parish Priest Fr. Quinn and his curate Fr. Kelleher. Later Frs. Quinn and Kelleher were prosecuted for urging their flock not to pay tithes, In the context of resolving the ongoing agitation in relation to tithes in 1827, a new valuation system was undertaken, with the intention of extending the tithe to pastures as well as tillage, to try to ensure a more equitable system. The land was classified as arable, pasture, mountain or bogland. The rate levied on arable land was 7¬æ%, and 2¬Ω% on bog and mountain. ===Poor Inquiry 1833=== It was advised by Fr. Kelleher, Curate of Durrus, that 'the lands are let to the highest bidder; the competition is very great, the tenant holds no tenure in almost every case, but his landlord's will or caprice and that neither landlord or tenant look beyond the gain of the hour the face of the country testifies' ===Literacy 1841=== The percentage of males who could read and write in the 1841 Census for Durrus was between 15 and 19%. ===Monster Meeting Curragh Hill, Skibbereen 1842=== Daniel O'Connell presided at a monster meeting in July 1842 attended by an enormous crowd from all districts of West Cork. Prior to the meeting he lodged with Fr. Doheney P.P. Dunmanway and travelled with him by coach and four, as they approached Skibbereen they were feted by a procession made up of bakers, blacksmiths, shoemakers, tailors and weavers preceded by a band. The Liberator's carriage was followed by those of gentlemen and clergy. He started the address sin Irish and then switched to English. He spent the night with the administrator Fr. Fitzpatrick and was presented with ¬£500 repeal rent. It is regarded as the largest crowd ever to gather in West Cork. In the memoirs of T.D.Sullivan (one of the Home Rule MPs from Bantry/Durrus Cross), he describes the temperance bands going from Bantry to the Monster Meetings in Skibbereen during his youth. ===Famine=== There were 'minor' famines in 1817 and 1822. There was a very wet and cold summer and autumn in 1816, a typhus epidemic broke out and up to 65,000 died countrywide from fever. In 1822 reports of distress commenced in April. Among the relief measures was the efforts of the City of London Tavern a grouping of business and banking people in London and they sent the Rev. John Jagoe (Schull) a cargo of meal for Schull and Durrus. Relief was carried out on a cross community basis. The ratio of the population receiving rations in Durrus Parish was between 60 and 70 percent. The Vicar, William Moore Crosthwaite received 20 barrels of meal from the Quaker Boston Relief Committee. His health suffered and caused his eventual death in 1855. The Rev Allen Evanson received ¬£25 for 20 bags of rice from the Friends Central Relief Committee on 12 April 1847. Both O'Donovan and the Evansons seek grants under the Land Improvement Act of 1848 on 2 February. In February 1848 there were 191 from Durrus in the Bantry Workhouse. Pre famine the population was in 1841, 3731 and in 1851? this dropped to 2003, the number of houses went from 595 to 324. A sworn enquiry was held and the physician was called on to resign and the master and matron dismissed. ===Improvement in agricultural conditions 1851-1859.=== The price of butter on the Cork Market rose by 45% from 1851 and 1859 and store cattle by 50%. Guano a natural fertilizer from Peru was used together with mangolds turnips and improved grass varieties on the more progressive farms. Around this time the Royal Dublin Society was sending Inspectors around the area to teach best practice. Coral sand and seaweed were used to improve the soil. In Bantry Bay boats were engaged in coral sand, it would take three hours to load a boat and the cargo would fetch 8s. There were also twenty boats involved in the collection of seaweed, with a crew of two men and two boys earning 6-7s in the season. There was reorganisation of scattered land holdings. This tied in with the Bandon Estate taking over the Evanson holdings in Durrus. It is not clear if this was because of lease expiry or purchase. The Bandon Estate invested heavily, rebuilt the village in its present form in the 1850s and carried out land improvements. The records of the Dohertys, managers of the Estate would suggest a commercial and competent management, however the nature of the land and the poor condition of many of the tenants may have militated against the success of this. In 1860 a memorial was presented in Bantry to establish a branch of the National Bank, it was pointed out that there was a lack of coins and notes restricting commerce. Eventually in March 1865 the Munster and Leinster Bank established a branch in Bantry. There was a further period of distress in 1860. There were very large imports of Indian meal to Bantry in the 1860s as it had become a staple part of the diet. ===Lord Bandon=== The Bernards of Bandon became the Earls of Bandon in 1800. Sometime in the 1840/50s they came into possession of estates in Durrus, comprising townlands around the village and west to Ahakista. Lord Bandon is reputed to have built the folly at Drumnea, Kilcrohane as relief work 1n 1847. May Roberts, Brahalish in the 1890s remembers Lord Bandon arriving in the area in a four-wheeled car drawn by a pair of fine grey horses with Timmy Burke, the coachman on top. The Philips family were local agents. ===Brahalish Bracelet=== In 1843 the present road from Durrus to Kilcrohane was being built a gold bracelet was discovered at the Red Cliff at Brahalish. The Archaeological Journals Cork correspondent Edward Hoare reported that it had been sent to the British Museum. It is dated at 500 BC. ===Griffith Valuation 1847-1849=== As a consequence of the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act of 1838 a requirement for a new system of valuation to ensure the tax to be known as \\"Rates\\" would be assessed, on a consistent basis. It became known as the Griffith Valuation(the primary valuation of tenants) was commenced in West Corkin 1847‚Äì1849. Richard Griffith was the Director of the Valuation, he had previously been responsible for the building of the road from Skibbereen to Crookhaven, and the improvement of the road from Dunmanway to Bantry. Most of the detailed survey work in the area was done by Thomas Cox and J.H.Colthurst. In their valuations they had regard to the availability of sea manure i.e. sea sand and sea weed. Sea sand had been used in the area for 300 years before the survey. Sea Sand would be taken up to 10‚Äì15 miles inland and seaweed 2 to . In Durrus four of the nine townlands had rights to seaweed, and a respect of sea sand 18/- was the cost of a large boat load of sand containing about 16 one-horse cart loads. Land was valued at a premium of 12.5% to 20% and sometimes higher if it had access to a shore supply of manure, Dromreagh \\"it is 1 ¬Ω miles from the shore\\". It might be noted that the (coral) sand of Bantry Bay is an algal growth as opposed to shell sand. A tenement was defined as holding land or a building, or both together, and it was valued at 1850 prices, having regard to the fertility of the soil, and lands and buildings were valued separately. The division of a tenement into sub-tenements was indicated by the use of letters, and holdings in common were bracketed together. It is still the case that certain lands are held in common, for example in Coomkeen some of the rough land in held in shares of one seventh accruing to the farms there or in Classadoo. This is officially reflected in the Land Registry Folio. Joe O‚ÄôDriscoll b.1924 remembers old people minding cattle in Dunbeacon on the undivided part of larger fields. This may indicate a survival of the rundale system of land ownership. A House List accompanied the Survey, indicating the dimensions of each particular building. The Survey did not, however, record the presence of cottiers, or those who did not have a legal interest in the land which they occupied. ===(Griffith Valuation Lessors/Landlords)=== Brahalish * Rev.

In July 1882 R.W. Doherty Jnr. complained that tenants 'but principally those of Durrus near Bantry had paid no rent since 1880, his father had said in September 1881 'The Land Leagues are destroying the country and a lot of Protestants have joined them ... the Protestants at Durrus would pay no rent unless allowed 25% off. More like savages then human beings'. ===Land improvement/ Land Acts=== In the period after the famine the larger farms were run on more commercial lines and firms such as Warners in Bantry supplied an increasing range of machinery. This included furze cutting machines mangle grinders which had their logo and a range of horse drawn machinery. George Vickery, Ballycomane was a prizewinner in the Carbery Show, Skibbereen in 1896 and 1897. ===Distress 1890-1891=== There was a failure of the potato crop in 1889 which caused widespread distress in 1890. A public meeting was held in November 1890 headed by Fr. Kearney and the Rev. John Pratt and suggested the extension of the railway line from Durrus road to Dunmanus Bay. ===Magistrates=== Tim O'Donovan, O'Donovan's Cove, Carrickbui, Bantry. (Cork County Directory 1862) ===Visitors/events=== Fr. Theobald Mathew addressed a meeting in 1842, Cork Examiner 13 July 1842. This was the first large temperance meeting in the area and attracted great crowds. The Skibbereen Temperance Band arrived playing 'Rory O' Moore', on the platform in the yard, on the platform were Fr. Quinn (Durrus), Fr. James Doheny (Dunmanway), Fr James Barry (Schull) and many Catholic and Protestant gentlemen. Fr. Mathew condemned excessive drinking stating that in the parish of Muintir Bhaire, ¬£50 a week was being spent on drink.

According to the 1835 census, Sunnylven had a population of 1,476. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1965, the two neighboring municipalities of Sunnylven (population: 1,221) and Stranda (population: 3,453) were merged into one large Stranda Municipality. ==Government== All municipalities in Norway, including Sunnylven, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads.

Variations include the half Cuban eight and reverse half Cuban eight, intended as directional changes and which are listed below. Both the basic maneuver and its name are said to have been invented by Len Povey, an American pilot who had served with the Cuban Air Force. Somewhat by accident he performed it in 1936 at the All American Air Race Meeting, which was held in Miami.Franklin's Flying Circus and Air Show: A Short History of Aerobatics Povey had intended to perform snap rolls at the top of a loop but was going too fast, so elected to continue over the top of the loop and on a whim, did a half-roll on the way down and did a symmetrical figure in the other direction. When asked later what maneuver it was, Povey responded, \\"Just a Cuban eight\\". According to the Aresti Catalog, a Cuban eight is performed thus: 5/8s of a loop to the 45 degree line, 1/2 roll, 6/8s of a loop to the 45 degree line, 1/2 roll, 1/8s of a loop to level flight (half of the Cuban Eight is called a \\"half Cuban Eight\\", and the figure can be flown backwards, known as a \\"Reverse Cuban Eight\\"). center ==Half Cuban eight== From level flight, 5/8s loop to the inverted 45¬∞ line, 1/2 roll to erect down 45¬∞ line, pull to level flight. The move is similar to an Immelmann turn with the difference being in the location in the loop at which the roll is performed. The roll in an Immelmann turn is at the top of the loop. center ==Reverse half Cuban eight== From level flight pull to the 45¬∞ up line, 1/2 roll to inverted 45¬∞ up line, then 5/8s of a loop to level flight. center ==ReferencesExternal links== *More aerobatic maneuvers *Olan free Software for design of aerobatic sequences Category:Aerial maneuvers ","title":"Cuban eight"},{"id":"7444053","text":"The PMR-U is a Yugoslavian anti-personnel stake mine.

Many who had emigrated to Great Britain, the United States, Canada or Australia joined the defence forces at those locations. The Easter Rebellion in 1916 and the subsequent executions, together with the threat of conscription in 1917, along with rising casualties reduced support for the war. It was a prosperous period with high prices for cattle and agricultural produce. Bere Island was the base of the British Atlantic fleet and was the operating base for a flotilla of small boats and trawlers engaged in anti-U-Boat activities. It also had a kite balloon station used for anti-U-Boat activities on a site. Balloons went up during the day suspending a wicker basket carrying an observer with a telescope to look for enemy craft. Bere Island hosted a military hospital opened in 1915. It was also a training camp. In July 1915 approximately 1,500 of the Fourth Connaught Rangers trained there but only 300 returned alive and many were wounded. After the US entered the war in 1917 the US Navy based some craft in Castletown. The US Navy's Air Wing established a seaplane base on the eastern end of Whiddy Island that became operational on 25 September 1918 when the first two planes arrived. They controlled an area around Fastnet. One of the planes crashed on 22 October 1918, killing one. The base had an operational radio station receiving messages from as far as the US and Russia. Five planes were based in Whiddy. The station closed in January 1919. === The Troubles === The memoirs of Willie Kingston, Solicitor, Skibbereen (1885‚Äì1965), provide an interesting insight into the period of The Troubles from a Protestant. He was born a Methodist and qualified as a solicitor working in his cousin Jasper Wolfe's office. He sympathised with the objectives of Sinn F√©in, but abhorred the brutalities committed by both sides. He described his shock at the killings of William Connell and Matt Sweetman by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) on 19 February 1921. He wrote that at the end of 1920, when it became apparent that the troubles would continue a wave of emigration included some of his own friends. He described the period after the truce, when in April 1922 a wave of killings by Irregulars included Solicitor Francis Fitzmaurice in Dunmanway whom he had considered joining in practice. Others were shot around this time and rumours spread of a general massacre of Protestants. He decided to \\"clear off to Dublin\\" on 29 April 1922. He described the train from Cork to Dublin as filled with frightened Protestants. In the course of the journey, an explosion hit the tunnel in Cork, shots were fired at Limerick Junction and he saw a man with a revolver. In an attack by 5th Battalion, Cork No. 3 Brigade led by Ted O'Sullivan, on Durrus Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) Barracks, Constable Donovan injured his right hand and eventually lost it. O'Farrell claimed one RIC man was killed. Bantry Courthouse Burned 25 June 1920. Bantry RIC Barracks burnt 1920 (now part of Bantry Bay Hotel). An ambush on RIC on Bog Road, Clonee killed Constable Brett on 21 June 1920. He had been in the RIC for 30 years, the last 8 in Bantry. He was cycling with Constable Cleary, Sergeant Driscoll and Constables Cuniffe and Quinn. When they arrived at Clonee Wood on the road to Durrus from Bantry, they were raked by gunfire. Between 20 and 30 assailants were involved. The inquest in Bantry was presided over by Coroner Neville and the jurors called were John Sweeney, Marine Street, vintner, William B Roycroft, Bridge Street, auctioneer, James Downey, Main Street, shoemaker, Florence Connolly, Main Street, publican, Richard Swanton, William Street, flour merchant, George Symes, Blackrock Terrace, shop manager, Charles O'Donovan JP, Main Street, Draper, Edward Brooks, Marino Street, Shop Assistant, David Mahony, Gurtha, Farmer, Michael O'Driscoll, Gearhies, Shopkeeper, James J McCarthy, Wolfe Tone Square, hotel keeper, Arthur O'Connor, Blackrock Road, artisan. When the names were called out, only Roycroft, Swanton and Symes answered. The others were fined twenty shillings. It was said at the inquest that \\"no policeman that ever came to Bantry was more popular, and, deservedly so\\". Bigg's Mill burned at the Quay in Bantry on 25 July. G. W. Biggs wrote a letter to a newspaper stating that this was not the work of Sinn F√©in. The barytes mine was raided with explosives. Vickeries Hotel burnt in May 1921. Two bridges were blown up at the creamery and Dunbeacon Road. In April 1921, Wolfe, Kingston and Miss Brown motored to Durrus where Wolfe had a case at Petty Sessions. Kingston had been in Bantry earlier where he saw two men coming towards him, one saying to the other \\"that's him\\". He thought it was a case of mistaken identity. Later he met Jasper at the hotel. The group added cattle dealer (Bawnie) TT McCarthy earlier and drove to Durrus. Leaving Durrus for Caheragh, McCarthy was in front with Jasper. A workers hut and equipment at Durrus Road Railway Station were destroyed by fire. === Economic war === The 1932-38 Anglo-Irish Trade War, known as the Economic War was a time of hardship for farmers as cattle could not be exported and it was necessary to kill the calves and sell their skins for only twelve shillings. Bullocks sold for as little as ¬£2 and 12 dozen eggs for 24 pence. There were no buyers for butter. === Emergency/war === After World War II began their produce was in demand. Prices remained mostly stable. The rationing of tea and other items, entailed sacrifices but not hardship. Compulsory tillage affected a percentage of tilled land. The only cars in the Parish at the outbreak of war, belonged to the Priest, the Minister, Dinny John L O'Sullivan and Barry. The train took four hours to reach Cork. Coal was unavailable. The train stopped at each station to take on timber and turf. The Luftwaffe flew weather reconnaissance aircraft over the area and used the lighthouse at Dursey Island as a landmark. The keepers got used to a Junkers plane that used to fly from Merignac near Bordeaux. A German plane was hit by the Royal Navy's SS Major C and crashed into Cashelane Hill, Dunbeacon on 5 February 1941, killing five of its crew while one was taken prisoner. A German plane crash-landed on Mount Gabriel on 3 March 1942 killing all aboard. They were interred in Bentry Abbey. On 23 July 1943 another aircraft crashed on the island killing its crew of four. The National Library's Photographic Archive includes photographs taken by the Luftwaffe's aerial photographic wing of military barracks, the airport, railway stations and Dublin city centre. Many natives of the district emigrated to England, a number serving in the armed forces, while others worked in hospitals and factories. === Post-war === Emigration continued amid widespread poverty and stagnation, apart from a brief uplift in the late 1940s. As John Crowley and the then chairman of Drinagh Co-Op drove west passing ruined houses, the chairman remarked that it was only a matter of time before no one was left on the Peninsula. Political excitement was provided by a new political party Clann na Poblachta. Bottled gas, yellow for Kosangas and silver and red for Calor gas became available for cooking and lighting using a silk mantle. Some continued to use paraffin and Tilley lamps. In the late 1950s rural electrification brought electricity. Some residents distrusted electricity and insisted that poles and meters be removed. The Land Project aimed to increase farm productivity by reclamation, drainage and better animal husbandry. Lorries carrying lime, sea sand, pipes and machinery supplied reclamation assisted by grants. Tractors appeared and older cattle breeds were replaced over with black Anglias became common. === 1960s === In the early 1960s, old cowhalachts (old houses/ruins) began to be rebuilt. Englishwoman Mrs. Burton redeveloped the cottage at Ahagouna Bridge, Tom Mahony's house, the O'Sullivan house both in Coomkeen and The Old Mill. In the mid-1960s, Gulf Oil built an oil storage complex on Whiddy Island. The complex started a boom, attracting workers to settle in the district. Local people acquired skills in construction and worked on major projects such as Pfizer's in Cork and Alcan Aluminium in Limerick. The first supertanker Universe Ireland arrived at Whiddy in October 1968. The tankers were serviced by four tugs, Bantry Bay, Dingle Bay, Brandon Bay, Tralee Bay. The terminal closed on 8 January 1979 when the Betelgeuse exploded, killing fifty people. Tourism catered to English visitors in bed and breakfast inns and premises such as Ballyrooster House. The renewal of the troubles in Northern Ireland and competition from Spain crimped the industry. == Historical economy  Quarries/mines === Rossmore slate quarry was owned by a Liverpool Company in 1865 with exports to England, Scotland and France. The quarry ceased operations in 1917. The remains of the powder store and tool shed are still visible. Friendly Cove Slate Quarry opened in the 1870s by Mr. Morris. Scart Barytes Mine supplied Harris paint factory in 1886. ore was exported in loads of 200‚Äì300 tons for porcelain manufacture. Rooska and Killeveenogue Silver and Lead Mine produced 65 tons of lead and 70 ounces of silver between 1849 and 1852, but ran out of capital. A quarry owned by Timothy McCarthy operated in 1912. Dereenalomane Barytes Mine was originally worked as a copper mine Traill and Thomas in 1840, producing 19 tons of copper, before shifting to barium sulphate, a heavy white mineral, (used for paint, papermaking, etc.) Josiah Wedgwood used it for making pottery. Geologist T. D. Triphook, was involved in 1854 when it was known as the Bandon Barytes Mines. From 1860 the mine was managed by Charles Thomas, a Cornish Mining Captain, followed by George Ellis in the 1870s. From 1820 to 1920 intermittently when 2,500 tons were raised in 1851 compared to only 800 tons in three other centres in the former United Kingdom. The material was washed, dried, crushed and milled. It was packed into bags and sent to an island jetty in Dunmanus Bay by a aerial ropeway. In 1917 a major fire caused extensive damage including the underground workings. Although repairs were carried out the mine never reached its former output. Mining historian Grenville AJ Cole regarded it as the first in Ireland and one of the earliest in the world. The companies listed as having worked the mine were, Marty Dennis and Co., British Barytes Co., Durrus Barytes Co., Mount Gabriel Barytes and Umber Co., Irish Barytes and Umber Co., Dereenlomane, Barytes Mines Ltd., Dunmanus Barytes Mines Ltd. === Mill === The Moynihan family operated a water mill fed by a sluice from the Durrus River, starting at the Creamery and continuing to the Mill. It had extensive use during the Second World War. Moynihan was the headmaster in the school. In the 19th century there was also a scutch mill listed in Griffiths Valuations. === Markets and fairs === In 1912, butter markets operated on Wednesdays and Fridays near the present creamery. The main market was in Bantry with fair day the first Friday each month. The pig fair was held on a Thursday. In the early 20th century, Bantry celebrated the fourth largest fair in Ireland. The railway ran as many as eight carriages to carry cattle and pigs to Cork. The annual horse fair was Ballibui in August in Dunmanway. When the marts started, especially Bandon and Skibbereen (started by Cork Co-Operative Marts in 1958) it sounded the death knell of the cattle fair. Durrus Fair held near Creamery and was revived in 1937 after 20 years. === Dairy and creamery === In Gaelic Ireland, a person's wealth was measured by the size of his cattle herd. A wealthy man was reckoned to be \\"fear mile bo\\", a man of a thousand cows. The Brehon laws emphasized cattle ownership. The diet before the introduction of the potato had a major dairy-product component. Around 1630, the practice of packing butter for export in wooden firkins (56 lb.) was introduced to Ireland. By 1730, Cork merchants were distributing firkins to small farmers in Munster, ensuring that the butter would be returned in good quality containers. By the mid-18th century, a thriving trade sent butter to the Cork market, but the round trip by horse-drawn cart from Skibbereen could take eight days. In the 1730s, Cork merchants came to Bantry every summer, primarily in connection with the pilchard trade, but also to export butter. In addition, farmers and car men faced the hazards of highwaymen. Many did not use carts. This was evidenced by Sir John Carr in 1805, who wrote \\"peasants with horses carrying barrels of butter to Cork secured as usual with ropes of hay\\" and Sir Richard Colt Hoare in 1806, who said \\"numerous troops of pack horses conveying casks of salt butter from the interior to Cork\\". Patrick and Andrew Gallwey of Bantry wrote in 1737 that the small cows in the district would have produced from half to two-thirds of a hundredweight of butter per annum. In the post-famine era, with consolidation of holdings and the collapse of grain prices with the passing of the Corn Laws, dairying assumed greater importance. The merchants would receive butter in amounts of 20 or and salt and make it up to , the measure of a firkin, they would pay the same as applied in the Cork Butter Market. The railway reduced the time to take butter to market by 75%. William Warner of Bantry, owned creameries at Killarney, Enniskeane and Ballinacarriga and developed butter aimed at the export market. In partnership with James Manders, who later left the partnership he started a factory at William Street, by 1886 its production was ¬£6,000 in the summer and employed a hundred men including fifty coopers. Before the Land Acts that transferred ownership to tenants in the early-20th century, it was common for land to be worked by a combination of owner and dairyman. In one such case, the Sullivan dairy family at Moulivard and elsewhere agreed in 1897 to work lands at Rusheenisca. By agreement of 13 January 1897 between Robert Phillips, Church House, Clowes, Worcestershire, England, and John Sullivan of Durrus, the owner agreed to give the milk and produce of 27 in-calf cows and any cows that the owner may buy, to make up the above number and calves, on or above 15 May 1898 for the Dairy Year of 1898. The dairyman was given liberty to graze six sheep, to grow potatoes for his own use and he was equipped with dairy utensils and a half tonne of bran. He was to be permitted to sow last year's tillage to oats and wheat for his own use, with the straw to be the owner's property. In return, the dairyman was to pay Phillips ¬£6.15.0d. for each cow and the owner was to allow Sullivan ¬£6.0s.0d. for properly protecting the hay. The dairyman was to pay the sum of ¬£100 0s.0d., with the balance to be secured by a promissory note. Should the dairyman decide not to renew the dairy agreement for the year 1898, he was to be allowed such root crops. A major influence in establishing the creamery in 1933 was Canon McManaway. It was largely built by cross- community voluntary labour. Work started in 1933 and it opened in the spring of 1934. Farmers gave a week at a time with horse and cart. Gravel was sourced from the strand and rock was quarried east of Ballycommane Road. It was necessary to register 1,000 cows and guarantee ¬£1,000 over three years. McManaway was also involved in starting the creamery at Kilcrohane and Dunmanway and worked closely with Fr. McSweeney. This creamery was opened before those at Caheragh, Kealkil and Bantry and apart from Durrus farmers, other suppliers from those areas delivered their milk on floats carrying 15 or more churns. Butter was sold to Jeremiah O'Sulivan's stores for 4d/lb and was packed in boxes. It went by horse and cart to Durrus Road Station and then to Cork. The creamery operated as a general store where farmers could make purchases against their cheques. It purchased chickens and turkeys and supplied meal and other farm supplies. == Fishing  Sea urchin fishery 1960s to 1980s === A thriving sea urchin fishery operated in Dunmanus Bay, in the area bounded by Mannion's Island Ahakista and the ruined Dunmanus Castle. The waters are shallow and this encouraged urchin growth. The fishery was operated by Paudie McSwiney, John, Patrick and Joe Arthur of Kenmare Saw Mills and John and Dermot Murphy of Bantry. The boatmen were Joe and Mick Flynn of Gearameen Durrus. The Lucey family of Waterville and a French Company operating out of Crookhaven were also in the business. At different stages four or five boats operated. The urchins were picked from the seabed by divers. John Arthur said that they would often spend four hours in the water. The urchins were sold on the French market live and were shipped through Cork Airport. The fishery was effectively wiped out with the sudden onset of red tide in the early eighties and by overharvesting, preventing regeneration. Kenmare Bay suffered a similar fate and urchin \\"fishing\\" is now unheard of in these bays. === Seafood === Among those involved in the scallops were Frank Arundel of Ahakista, Jim Flynn of Gearhmeen, Jack Connolly, Gearhmeen, Mossy Cremin, John and Jimmy O Mahony (Durrus) and Con Coughlan, Patsy Flynn, and Mattie Coughlan were all well-known fishermen during the 50s and 60s. In wartime, the catch was exported to the UK while an ever-increasing demand for seafood at home supported them in later years. The tradition stretched into the new century with Teddy and Frankie Arundel, Frank and Gerard Coughlan, Tommy Arundel and Tony Mc Loughlin all involved. Summer is spent on lobster, prawns and crayfish. Paddy Barry was involved in boats during the 60s. === Periwinkles === Winkles have been harvested along the shores of Dunmanus Bay for many years, and in the past were purchased for the French market by a company operating from Crookhaven who stored them in ponds awaiting transportation. They were collected on a regular basis by truck. ==Petty Sessions Court== The Courthouse is still in the village between O'Sullivans and the Sheep's Head public houses. These courts were set up in the early 19th century. Before that magistrates administered justice according to their whim. Fr. Collins Administrator of Skibbereen, giving evidence to select committees of the House of Lords and Commons in 1824 referred to 'presents' being given to the Magistrates of corn, cattle money and having their turf cut. The Government pressured the Magistrates to hold the Petty Sessions in public with three or four sittings in March 1822. This was formalised under the Petty Sessions Act of 1827. The petty session's nearest modern equivalent is the District Court except that the Petty Sessions operated with the involvement of local prominent people with no legal qualifications. Under the Peace Preservation Act 1814 the resident magistrates appointed were generally strangers and therefore presumably immune to pressures applied to local magistrates. == Churches  Catholic === It is believed a thatched church on the site of the Old Mill, now Cois Abhann was built around 1750. Mass Rocks church, one in Coomkeen in the lands of Timmy Whelly and one at Kealties. A church at Kealties was a thatched structure erected c.1780. The old Durrus Church at Moulivard was in use mid-17th century, but according to Brady was in ruins by 1699. Tradition located a church at Coolculachta. After the 1798 Rebellion and the arrival of the French Armada in Bantry the church was forced to close. The former church at Chapel Rock (on the site of the present National School) was built by Fr. Quinn in 1820 and was a slated structure. Fr. Richard Quinn arrived in the parish from Onoyne, in Co. Tipperary in 1818. In 1820 he started the parish register of births, marriages and deaths. The church was replaced when the Church of the Sacred Heart was built in 1901. This was built on a site of by way of lease to Fr. O'Leary from the Earl of Bandon for 990 years at a rent of 10 shillings per annum. The first sod was cut by Dan Keohane and John Sullivan, Clonee. The contractor was Daniel O'Donovan, Bantry and the stone was provided from a quarry at Fahies, Clashadoo owned by the Shannon family and drawn to the site by Patrick Crowley of Ahagouna. The cost of the church was ¬£2,900 and the Architect was Maurice Alphonsus Hennessy from the South Mall, Cork A mural tablet to the Blair family of Blairscove and outside a Celtic Cross is a memorial to the Tobin family in Irish and English. The Stations are an old tradition going back to Penal times. In each townland families in turn rotated to have mass in the house where the parish dues were taken. It was and is a time of great preparation with help from neighbours in the preparations. A wax candle blessed on Candlemas Day 2 February was used. Stations used to start at 9 a.m. but are now generally in the evenings. === Church of Ireland === Brady mentions a church and chancel in Durrus in 1615 and the Rector Thomas Barnam says in 1639 that it was in good condition unlike the one in Kilcrohane. The Cork Directory of 1875 mentions a ruined church near Durrus Court. On 27 November 1792 by order of the Lord Lieutenant in Council the parishes of Kilcrohan, Durrus and Kilmacomoge were divided and the new parish of Durrus and Kilcrohan were created. St. James, Church of Ireland, built 1792, at a cost of ¬£461 10s. 9.25d. The aisle was rebuilt following collapse. A south aisle was added in 1867 design by William Atkins. The Rectory (Glebe) was built by the Rev. Edward Jones Alcock in 1831, following Glebe at Cappanahola. Licensed places of Worship in Glenlough and Rooska (1852‚Äì1866) were in schoolhouses. In 1935 the entrance was widened, railings were erected and gates were added. This work was done by Dick Gay and Eddie Brooks and paid for by a former parishioner Mr. Hosford, resident in England. In 1940 the Vestry Room was built. In 1949 gas lighting was installed followed by electricity in the early 1960s. In 1989 extensive renovations were carried out. A parochial hall was built partly by voluntary labour at the Rectory and opened on 22 August 1951. The new Rectory was completed in 1965. The parishes of Durrus and Kilcrohane seem to have been separated between 1634 and 1639, but reunited by 1663. Some of the services and sermons were conducted in Irish c. 1850 when the Rev. Crosthwaite's services were attended by thirty converts and several poor Protestants who traveled six to ten miles to attend the Parish Church. Rooska Church was built 1866 to a design of William Atkins. This Church closed in January 1988. === Methodist === The Methodist church was built in 1827 as Four Mile Water Church Hall in village. The last church on the Dunbeacon Road, it was built c. 1930 and closed in the early 1950s. Durrus was part of the Skibereen circuit that included the Berehaven Mines, Fivemile Water, Durrus and Drimoleague, with a Minister resident in Bantry. Methodist families included two Brooks and Kingstons in Dromreagh, Vickeries in Ballycomane and Rooska and Millars in Coolcolacta. == Schools == While the National school system was begun in 1831, formal education had begun long before. The Commission of Public Instruction, Ireland, produced a report in 1835 covering local education provision. The details for \\"Durruskilcrohane\\": A girls' school was kept by Eliza Daly with an annual grant from the British and Irish Ladies School Society of ¬£12. It had 83 students, with an average daily attendance of 55. Instruction consisted of reading, writing, arithmetic, needlework, scripture and Church catechism. A day school was led by James Kingston with an annual grant from the Association for Discontinuing Vice of ¬£8. Housing was rent free and an acre of ground came from the vicar. 30 students with average daily attendance of 22. Instruction consisted of reading, writing, arithmetic, scriptures and Church catechism to the Protestants. A coeduational day school was kept by Samuel Hatfield. Subscriptions from the vicar and others and the payment by the children were 1s. 6d.a quarter. 29 boys and 16 girls were enrolled. Instruction consisted of reading, writing, arithmetic, scripture and Church catechism. It was established 9 June 1834. A coeducational day school was operated by Timothy Daly with an annual grant from the London Hibernian Society of 1s. per quarter for each child, and payments by the children of 1s per quarter. It was established in 1832. 91 boys and 11 girls were enrolled with average daily attendance of 65. Instruction consisted of reading, writing, arithmetic and scripture. A National School was run by John McCarthy, using annual grant from the Board of ¬£8, and payment of 6d. a quarter by the children. Enrolled were 61 males 39 females with daily attendance of 55. Instruction consisted of reading, writing, arithmetic and the Roman Catholic Catechism. A girls school was led by Margaret Forbes with annual grant from the London Ladies Society of ¬£12. 14 males and 72 females were enrolled with average daily attendance of 35. Instruction consisted of reading, writing, arithmetic, needlework and scripture. A Hedge school was kept by Thomas Toomey. Tuition was 1s. 6d. to 3s. a quarter. Enrolled were 58 boys and 10 girls with summer attendance of 40. Instruction consisted of reading, writing, arithmetic and Roman Catholic Catechism. A Sunday school with books from the Sunday School Society enrolled 25 boys and 55 girls. Average attendance was 40. The school taught scripture to the children. === Catholic Four Mile Water === An application to register the female school was made in 1853, 1860 and 1865. The latter succeeded but the school was struck off in 1880 and restored later. The male school applied in 1868 and 1883. In 1868, a 17-year-old assistant teacher, John Leary was present. The monitor, John Canty resigned in September 1868. The principal was Denis Leary who taught 3rd. class. 97 pupils enrolled with an average attendance of 63.3‚Äì64.8. The manager was Fr. O'Flynn PP. The 1875 student body include 131 boys and 161 girls. === Rossnacaheragh === In 1875 it had 136 pupils. One teacher was Mary Sullivan. === Church of Ireland schools === These schools remained outside the National School system until later in the 19th century and were supported by the Church Education Society In the 1840s the Rev. Crosthwaithe received support for schools from the Coast and Islands Society which continued until near the end of the century. === Aughagoheen Church of Ireland === Rev. William O'Grady on a \\"Bantry Club\\" letterhead wrote seeking the entry of Aughagoheen into the National System. It had been under the Church Education Society (founded 1839) whose involvement would finish upon recognition. The patrons were O'Grady and EE Leigh White Esq. He proposed to provide privies and that George Patison aged 18.5 would be the teacher and live in a parish house provided. An inspection disclosed school hours of 10 am to 2:30 pm with religion 2‚Äì2:30. The school enrolled 16 pupils: nine males and six females. Annie Stephens later applied to teach. She had been a monitor at Carrigbui up to third class and was in sole charge for ten months (this may have been Durrus C of I school). She would be eligible to substitute and was to go for training later. The file indicated that the school was unable to supplement the teacher's salary. O'Grady proposed to later pay ¬£10 in addition to the state salary. Stephens was prepared to work without a local subvention. The appointment went instead to Susanna Perrott, aged 20. From 1 September 1902, she had trained at the Church of Ireland College at Kildare Street. The school was expected to have 29-plus pupils, including two from Scart Catholic School which at that time had attendance averaging between 24.9 and 38.4. After recognition the roll was 17 boys and six girls and the attendance ranged between 10.0 and 18.5. Rebecca Kingston resigned as teacher from 10 March 1910 and it was suggested that the school close and that the students would go to Bantry at a conveyance cost of ¬£63 per annum. O'Grady appealed this on hardship grounds, pointing out that many of the children had to come up side roads. The Inspector conducted an enquiry looking at the distances the children had to travel and suggested that the school stay open. The family names of the children were Swanton (three families), Love, Foley, Jago, Sullivan, Shannon and Deane. Florence M. Clarke resigned on 28 August 1914 replaced by Ella Newman (she had been a junior literary mistress in Bantry from 8 August 1911). Newman had trained at St. Mary's Shandon and passed the relevant exam and was given provisional recognition from 22 October 1915. === Church of Ireland Durrus === The original school at Clashadoo was built c.1780. In 1875 60 pupils were enrolled. It was replaced by the school at Ahagouna in 1937 after a diphtheria epidemic killing several children. This school cost ¬£1,600. A second teacher was employed. This school in turn is to be replaced by a new school under construction only in 2006 on an adjoining site acquired from John McCarthy. Schools also operated at Rooska and Dunbeacon. In 1947‚Äì50 school transport was provided by Lottie Dukelow by pony and trap. Earlier Bert Dukelow provided transport with a horse and trap for the children on the south side of the bay. === Rooska School === Rev. Pratt applied for recognition as a National School in 1898. The old school was built around 1822/1823 when Captain White gave a permanent lease. The school was inspected on 9 February 1898. He reported the building in fair condition, one room, no privies, stone and mortar and drew attention to needed improvements. Other nearby schools were Gurtalasa, Four Mile Water, Durrus, Bantry, Whiddy, Rusnacaharagh and Morragh (Methodist Durrus). Normally a school would have to be more than three miles (5 km) from another school but in this case the application was approved from 1 January 1898 in the exceptional circumstance of a mountain range preventing children from attending. The school had been supported by the Island and Coast Society ¬£20, The Church Education Society ¬£7, The Diocesan Board ¬£5 and the Manager ¬£3. The roll was 12 boys and 6 girls. === Cashelane Church of Ireland School === Rev. R. H. Carroll the Manager of Altar Rectory, Toormore, applied for a grant to build a school. The mixed school would have 30 children. In 1902 the average attendance was 10.7‚Äì11. The nearby Catholic School at Dunbeacon had an average attendance of 54.8‚Äì68.3, and included 11 Established Church children and had an assistant teacher. Ms. Trinder, who had qualified from the Church of Ireland College in 1894 and had taught at Kilcoe/Corrovally was appointed. The new manager was Rev. A. J. Brady as the school was now in his parish. In October 1906 the attendance was 10 boys and 10 girls. === Methodist === The Methodist school at Morragh applied to become a National School in 1882 and 1883. The site was leased from Richard Tonson Evans 1 May 1862 by way of a \\"lease of three lives\\" (a lease that continues as long as all three of the leaseholders survive.) In 1907 the school merged with the Church of Ireland school in Durrus. Only 4 of the 30 pupils were Methodist. === Church Society schools === Schools at Knockroe, Gearhies and Gortalassa employed Irish-speaking teachers including Seamus O'Suilleabhain of the Ui Shuilleabhain Fachdnaidh at Bonane near Kenmare. It is believed that the Irish Society was active in this regard. === Secondary school === The Mercy Order started a school for girls in 1863, initially on a National School Curriculum. The curriculum later expanded to include bookkeeping, agriculture, horticulture, mechanical drawing, dressmaking and cookery. Art, craft and design vocal, choral and instrumental music and song were included. Children were prepared for civil service exams and trained as monitors who would teach in the National Schools. The Intermediate Course started in 1911 and in 1927 a Secondary \\"top\\" was attached to the National School. In 1878 the two schools became distinct and the convent school was the only one in the area to provide full-time second level education. In the absence of transport the secondary school was of limited use to children in outlying areas such as Durrus. === Lace School === The Sisters of Mercy in Bantry started Conventual Industries, a development of training and employment and restarted the dormant lace-making industry in 1902, which lasted into the 1950s. == Notables == Robert Dawson Evans * James Swanton, (c.1760‚Äì1828) joined Berwick's Irish regiment in 1780 and was great-grandfather of Hilaire Belloc (1870‚Äì1953) * Sir Francis L. O'Callaghan, (1839‚Äì1909), son of James O'Callaghan, JP was educated Queen's College, Cork in Engineering. He was a consultant to the Government of India for State Railways, supervised construction of Railway bridge over River Indus and the railway through the Bolan Pass. * Robert Swanton from Ballydehob, United Irishman, lawyer in New York. He chaired a meeting of \\"the Friends of Ireland in New York\\" in 1825, possibly the first attempt to mobilise the Irish in America. He became a judge of the Marine Court in New York, returning home in 1836 and died in Ballydehob in 1841.

In theory these were religious, but in practice they were a form of recreation. In 1813, folklorist Thomas Crofton Croker (1798‚Äì1854) attended a pattern at Gougan Barra on St.John's Eve. Large crowds gathered along the lakeshore and in and around the chapels. Penitents inside were on their knees, some with arms uplifted praying aloud others counting rosary beads or using a small pebble or cutting notches on a stick to indicate the number of prayers to be repeated. A rusty piece of iron was passed from one pilgrim to the next and placed on the head three times, accompanied by a prayer. A man belonging to a mendicant order scratched the wall of the well with a piece of slate, following the imprint of the cross. The pieces of slate were sold to pilgrims afterwards as relics. Inside the door of the well seven or eight people were in the water exhibiting their sores. Outside little bottles of glass water were sold and applied to an infected part. Women waited with naked infants to dip them into the well waters. Tented merchants sold whiskey, porter and bread. In most tents a piper played and young people danced, the women choosing the partner. Twenty or thirty people were in each tent, drinking heavily and singing rebellious songs that were greeted with howls of approval. By evening most were drunk, cudgels were brandished amid general mayhem. Attendees unleased a confused uproar of prayers and oaths of sanctity and blasphemy sounded in the same instant of the ear. The Bishop of Cork, Dr. John Murphy banned the Gougan pattern in 1818. The Protestant clergyman Caesar Otway (1780‚Äì1842) visited in 1827 and counted 936 Paters, Aves and Credos. === Athletics === In the post-famine era dejection led to mass emigration. By the 1870s extant works offer many references to races, weight throwing and events in Kilcrohane and Ahakista. It was common for people to cross Dunmanus Bay for events on the other side or to meet half way in Carbery Island. === GAA history === Skibbereen was popular in the 1880s. However, the near total failure of the potato crop in 1890 led to panic, shrinking the number of clubs from 38 to 2. Rules were loose and matches sometimes developed into a melee. In the 1930s, the playing field was in Clashadoo opposite the former schoolhouse. Teams would often travel to matches in the back of Jackie Cronin's lorry. Players from the area included Robert O'Sullivan (he is a brother of Danny O'Sullivan publican and later joined the Garda√≠) he played minor football for Cork in the 1960s. The GAA in the parish went through many changes. The only record of a trophy was a West Cork Junior 2 title in 1932 with a team captained by Bill Kennedy (died 2004) from Dunmanus. The parish waited 60 years for a repeat. The parish were represented by a side called Western Stars in the 1960s. Tim Cronin and Sean O'Suilleabhain organised a new club in the early 1970s called Muintir Bhaire. The most notable event came in the mid-1970s when they reached a West Cork Junior Final. Emigration led to the near demise of the club during the 1980s. Joe O Driscoll restarted the team leading to winning games @ Fe 12 & 14\\\\. The club sank and then rose again with the arrival of Frank Arundel and Tom Coughlan with West Cork titles Fe 21 (C)96 & Fe 21 (B)in 98. At the turn of the 21st century the West Cork Junior (B) cup came to the Parish under the Management of Jack Mc Nulty with selectors Vincent Cronin and Tom Coughlan. The team was coached by Caheragh native Tony O'Driscoll and captained by Sean Tobin. In 2003 the first-ever Cork County title came to the Parish. The Club were promoted to Junior 1 in 04 and reached the West Cork final in 07. They won the West Cork Junior League in 2009, defeating Kilmacabea in the final. === Bowling === The introduction of flax in the mid-18th century followed by the introduction of weaving families from the north of Ireland may have introduced bowling to West Cork. With the improvement in the roads in the late 19th century it begins to register in the folklore with names such as Skuse of Brahalish and Barrett of Colomane mentioned. === Cards === The games of 45 and 110 were once very popular. === Music === In the 1850s, when Francis O'Neill (Irish Music collector) was a child, many musicians played in his parents' house. In Durrus, Nell Burke Coomkeen, played the melodian in her younger days. In the 1930s the Station Heights in Dunbeacon was a centre for dancing and music in particular the Daly house. Music was supplied by the two Mahony Brothers. A wooden platform on Dunbeacon crossroads for dancing was in use over the weekend and put away on Sunday night. In the early 1960s or the late 1950s, Eugene Wiseman formed a five-piece dance band that became very popular known as \\"The Roving Serenaders\\". Pete Sullivan, Bill Cotter, Mary Minehane and Michael Cotter on vocals were the mainstays. Wiseman created another band called \\"The Fastnet Five\\" performing all over the County. === Regattas === Bantry had a Regatta in 1833. == Transportation  Bus === Before the extension of the railway from Drimoleague to Bantry, a coach service was provided from Bandon to Bantry. Travel time by train and coach from Cork to Bantry was approximately 6¬Ω hours. The fare was 4s. === Steamer === A steamer service operated between Cork and Dingle, between the late 1850s and 1905. The Clyde Shipping Company took over this service in 1876, calling at Bantry to pick up pig and millstuffs. === Rail === As early as 1836, consulting engineer Charles Vignoles put forward a scheme to the Railway Commission for a trunk line from Dublin to Cork, including a branch running from Blarney through Macroom and Glengarriff to Castletownebere. The report, however, made no mention of the line to service West Cork. A Company proposed a line from Cork to Bandon in 1845 and in 1846, which included a projected line to Bantry. Work commenced in November 1879, opening for business in 1881. In the line's heyday in the early 20th century, four services traveled each day to and from Cork. The line became an important link in the \\"Prince of Wales Route\\" from Cork to Killarney via Bantry and Glengarriff. In 1902 the company opened a circular route from Bantry to Dunmanus Bay. Inclusive fares were 13s.6d. First Class, 12s.0d. Second Class, and 10s.0d Third Class, to include luncheon at Ahakista Hotel and tea at Bantry. To encourage tourism, the Local Development Syndicate (which had acquired the coaching business of Vickery of Bantry) agreed to do the coach and provide refreshments at 7s.0d a head. The Company agreed to provide a special train to Bantry and back and to contribute half the cost of the refreshments. The line suffered significantly during the Troubles and Civil War. In an ambush on the train at Upton on 15 February 1921, six were killed, and two days later Scart Bridge was blown up, stopping service west of Drimoleague. On 7 August 1922, (the Civil War had started in June 1922) Chetwynd Viaduct was severely damaged by explosives. Service to Bantry resumed only in April 1923. Signal Cabins and Staff Instruments were destroyed by fire at Durrus Road Station. With the introduction of a diesel locomotive in 1954, passenger numbers increased from 20 to between 80 and 130. However, a policy of closing rail lines, and the loss of the Bandon section along with financial losses Stg.¬£91,000, which together with the prevailing mood at the time, ended the entire West Cork system. The last train went from Bantry to Cork on Good Friday, 31 March 1961. ==Telephones== The phone service began with a manual exchange in the Post Office. A subscriber trunk dialling system came circa 1981. In 1979 the Betelgeuse exploded at the jetty at Whiddy Oil Terminal, killing over 40 people. A postal strike ran from January until the end of June. It stopped postal service and closed down phone service in those parts of the country still on manual exchanges, including Durrus. ==See also== * Early history of Durrus and District ==References== *Bantry Historical Journal, Vol 1,2. * Evelyn Bolster: A History of the Diocese of Cork, Tower Books, Cork, 1982, , Catholic Central Library, Dublin *James I.

Erratic running speeds, particularly the urge to sprint early in a race while feeling fresh, consume energy inefficiently. A glance at the paceband and stopwatch as each distance marker is passed allows the athlete to quickly determine if they are running too fast for their targeted finishing time or too slowly and adjust accordingly.

THQ published the title for the Dreamcast while Sega released it for arcades. It is based on the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) professional wrestling promotion and its yearly Royal Rumble event. Yuke's, creators of the WWF SmackDown! series developed Royal Rumble, which had several unique features including support for up to nine wrestlers on the screen simultaneously. The Dreamcast version was released to mixed reviews that faulted its small roster and lack of gameplay modes. == Gameplay == Steve Austins. The game has two modes, Exhibition and Royal Rumble. In Exhibition mode, the player chooses a wrestler along with a partner and wrestles a series of singles matches. The player's partner can interfere on the player's behalf on command. These partner moves can be used any number of times during the match, but must be recharged before they can be used again. The object of each match is to wear down the opponent using various attacks and grappling maneuvers, decreasing their life bar before ending the match by pinfall or knockout. Royal Rumble mode involves a multi-wrestler match in which the player must eliminate a certain number of opponents from the match within a time limit by sending them over the top rope and onto the floor. Eliminating opponents adds more time to the player's clock; eliminating larger wrestlers offers a higher time bonus. Due to size of the game's roster, wrestlers appear multiple times in the same Royal Rumble match. Each player has a super meter that fills up during the course of the match. When it fills up, the player receives an \\"S\\" icon, which can be used to instantly recover from pin attempts in Exhibition mode or re-enter the ring during a Royal Rumble match. This was Big Show's only video game appearance with the 2000 roster, as he was removed from WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role and WWF No Mercy due to his demotion to Ohio Valley Wrestling. Coincidentally, he returned at the following year's Royal Rumble. Kurt Angle and Tazz (who debuted in a match against Angle on the 2000 edition of the titular pay-per-view) made their first WWF video game debuts in this game, before No Mercy and SmackDown! 2. ==Reception== Daniel Erickson reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"It's neither deep nor revolutionary, but it's a whole lot of fun.\\" The Dreamcast version received \\"average\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. One of the biggest criticisms was of the small number of playable characters, which IGN called \\"paper thin\\" and GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann called \\"confining.\\" The game's lack of modes was also criticized. IGN recommended other Japanese Dreamcast wrestling titles such as Toukon Retsuden and Giant Gram over Royal Rumble. The earliest review came from PlanetDreamcast, which gave it a low score of four out of ten over a month before the game was released. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 30 out of 40. == References  External links == * Category:2000 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Dreamcast games Category:Sega video games Category:WWE video games Category:Royal Rumble Category:THQ games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Tommy Tallarico Category:Yuke's games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Professional wrestling games ","title":"WWF Royal Rumble (2000 video game)"},{"id":"7444333","text":"Francesco de' Rossi (1510‚Äì11 November 1563) was an Italian Mannerist painter who lived and worked mainly in Florence, but also produced several works in Rome. He is known by many names, prominently the adopted name Francesco Salviati or as Il Salviati, but also Francesco Rossi and Cecchino del Salviati. ==Biography== Salviati was born in Florence. He apprenticed under Giuliano Bugiardini, Baccio Bandinelli, Raffaele Brescianino, and finally Andrea del Sarto in 1529‚Äì30. In 1531 he traveled to Rome, where he met another Bandinelli pupil, Giorgio Vasari, and helped to complete the frescoes on the Life of John the Baptist in the Palazzo Salviati for the Cardinal Giovanni Salviati. It is from his attachment to this household that he took on the surname. He frescoed an Annunciation in San Francesco a Ripa (1533‚Äì35). His mature style has mannerist contortions and crowded scenes similar to the output of Giulio Romano. In 1538 he joined Jacopino del Conte in completing a fresco of the Visitation for the Oratory of San Giovanni Decollato, a Florentine fraternity ministering to persons who had been condemned to execution. Salviati painted in Bologna in 1540 alongside Vasari, and stayed for a brief time in Venice, where he frescoed decorations for the Palazzo Grimani di Santa Maria Formosa in antique style. During this period his style shows the influences of Parmigianino. His many portrait paintings can sometimes be confused for Bronzino. Chalice, 1530s (Louvre Museum) In 1543 Salviati returned to Florence. Working for Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, he completed a fresco decoration eulogizing the Medici family (Triumph of Camillus in the Sala dell'Udienza of the Palazzo Vecchio, 1543‚Äì45). He also designed tapestry cartoons for the recently established Arazzeria, including Ecce homo, Resurrection, and Joseph explains the Pharaoh's dreams. The latter commission was awarded after a competition, which pitted him against contemporary Florentine Mannerists, Bronzino and Pontormo. He painted a Deposition altarpiece for Santa Croce in 1547‚Äì48. This theme, one which became a master oeuvre topic for Late-Renaissance artists, is handled in a crowded complex fashion. He often travelled to Rome between 1548 and 1563, to complete various fresco series, such as Wedding of Canae in the Oratory of the Piceni, a Birth of John the Baptist in the Oratory of San Giovanni Decollato, in the Palazzo della Cancelleria (Pallium Cappella), in the Palazzo Sacchetti (History of David), and in Palazzo Farnese. He died in Rome on 11 November 1563.

(; original title: \\"Io speriamo che me la cavo\\", which is a grammatically erronal phrase meaning \\"Let's hope that I scrape by [the Judgement Day]\\" taken from Raffaele's homework essay) is a 1992 Italian \\"fish out of water\\" comedy film about an elementary school teacher from northern Italy who is sent by mistake to an impoverished town in the Naples region of southern Italy. There he must deal with vast cultural differences and teach chronically truant children who only respect violence and power, especially one young boy who is already caught up in the gangster lifestyle. The film was directed by Lina Wertm√ºller and stars Paolo Villaggio. The script was inspired by the 1990 Italian bestseller Io speriamo che me la cavo (Me, Let's Hope I Make It). The book is a collection of essays written by the students of Italian primary school teacher Marcello D'Orta, who taught in Corzano, a suburb of Naples. In the essays the children describe many of the difficulties they and their families encounter (poverty, drugs, crime, the disrepair of their city, etc.). The film has the main protagonist often read the essays from the book (which, in the plot, are written as homework by the children), as their content is displayed through live-action scenes, although some other ones are simply adapted into plot elements and scenes. Io speriamo che me la cavo was also the original Italian title of the film. Reviewer Marc Vincenti notes of the film's R rating, \\"Why, you might ask, is a film that is without an iota of sex or violence, and that has completely to do with 8- and 9-year- olds, off limits to that very age group as an audience? Let's just say it was a good thing the subtitler knew how to spell four-letter words.\\"Vincenti, Marc. \\"Ciao, Professore!\\" Palo Alto Online, August 1994 ==Plot== Marco Tullio Sperelli is a professor of Italian language for children from the region of Liguria in northern Italy. Due to a failure of the Ministry of Education, he is transferred not to another northern town, but instead a similar-sounding town near Naples, in southern Italy. There he finds a school where the students, teachers and parents deal with the poverty of the south in a resigned and practical manner that he feels are unworthy of the morality, ethics and education children should learn. (For example, most of the children avoid school because they must work for a living to help support their families). Initially contemptuous of the attitudes in the south, and linking them to the underlying poverty, Marco Tullio requests a transfer back north. In the meantime, things are brought to a head by Raffaele, a student registered to his class who only shows up to recruit other children into the gangster lifestyle. Marco Tullio slaps Raffaele for threatening him with physical violence, and is then appalled when - instead of being scandalized by the event - the principal, children and even the boy's mother are encouraged by it because it means he may do what needs to be done to set the children on the right path. Marco Tullio rescinds his request for a transfer. Eventually, Raffaele grows respect for Marco Tullio after he helps save Raffaele's mother, who has become ill and needs transport to the hospital. In the end, Marco Tullio is transferred (it is implied that the principal, who does not like him for his arrogance, pushed the transfer through). As his train pulls away, he reads Raffaele's homework essay - the first homework he has handed in - which discusses the end of the world, and how many people will go to Hell, but some may yet enter Heaven. He ends with, \\"as for me, let's hope I make it\\" (hence the Italian version of the film title), implying that his improved behavior will not end with Marco Tullio's departure. The film ends as the teacher, watching through the window, sees the boy riding away in his motorcycle. == Cast == * Paolo Villaggio: Marco Tullio Sperelli * Paolo Bonacelli: Ludovico Mazzullo * Isa Danieli: Preside * Gigio Morra: Custode * Sergio Solli: Cartonaio == Year-end lists == * 10th ‚Äì James Berardinelli, ReelViews == References  External links == * * Category:1992 films Category:Films directed by Lina Wertm√ºller Category:Films set in Naples Category:Italian films Category:Italian-language films Category:1992 comedy films Category:Films about educators Category:Italian comedy films ","title":"Ciao, Professore!"},{"id":"7444424","text":"The 5th Earl of Caledon in 1932 Eric James Desmond Alexander, 5th Earl of Caledon (9 August 1885 - 10 July 1968) was a soldier and the eldest son of James Alexander, 4th Earl of Caledon and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Graham- Toler.

The municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1965. The administrative centre was the village of Vanse where Vanse Church is located. Lista municipality was historically known as the municipality of Vanse until 1911. The former municipality's land is now located in the present-day municipality of Farsund. Farsund Airport, Lista is located here, but it has not had any regularly scheduled commercial flights since 1999; however, there are discussions to use it as a base for offshore operations. Lista is located on a large peninsula along the Listafjorden and is home to the villages of Vestbygd and Vanse and the town of Farsund. ==Name== The municipality was named \\"Vanse\\" from its creation in 1838 until 1911 when the name was changed to Lista. The original name of the municipality (and the historic parish) was originally named after the old Vanse farm, where the first Vanse Church was built. This name was changed in 1911 to bring back the historic name of Lista for this region of Vest-Agder county. Lista is the name of the peninsula (Old Norse: Listi) where the municipality is located. The name Lista is derived from the Norwegian word lista which means \\"edge\\" or \\"rim\\". From 1662 until 1919, Vest-Agder county was named \\"Lister og Mandals amt\\", signifying the significance of the area. (The name Lista was misunderstood by Danish clerks as a plural form and therefore written with the plural ending -er.) ==History== The municipality of Vanse was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). According to the 1835 census, the municipality had a population of 4,213. On 1 January 1903, an area with 99 inhabitants was transferred from Vanse to the neighboring town of Farsund. Again in 1948, another area with 64 inhabitants was transferred from Lista to the town of Farsund. During the 1960s, there were many major municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1965, the municipalities of Lista, Herad, and Spind were merged with the town of Farsund to create a new, larger municipality of Farsund. Prior to the merger, Lista had a population of 4,544. == Notable people == * Evert Andersen * Marquis of Lista ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Weather information for Lista Category:Former municipalities of Norway Category:Farsund ","title":"Lista"},{"id":"7444493","text":"Grace Thompson was an early American silent film actress, starring in 10 films between 1914 and 1917. ==Filmography== *The Final Impulse (1914) *The Scarlet Sin (aka The Shepherd of the Mines) (1915) ....

In 2003, Queen & Country #8‚Äì12: \\"Operation: Crystal Ball\\" was nominated for the \\"Best Serialized Story\\" Eisner Award. The Publishers Weekly review of the Queen & Country: Volume 3: Operation: Crystal Ball trade paperback stated that \\"this book's pleasure lies in following the chase's twists and turns. Rucka and Fernandez accomplish this almost as well as any novel or film of the genre\\". Between 2005 and 2007, Fern√°ndez illustrated several nonconsecutive story arcs for the Punisher Marvel MAX Series, written by Garth Ennis and then in 2008, he began illustrating the restarted Stormwatch: Post Human Division.Wild at Heart: Leandro Fernandez, Newsarama, May 16, 2008 In 2009 and 2010, Fern√°ndez illustrated \\"The Plague Widow\\" story arc of the Vertigo publication Northlanders, written by Brian Wood. In an interview on the series, Wood said \\"Leandro Fernandez, someone I've wanted to work with since seeing his work on Punisher MAX, is turning in perfect issue after perfect issue. All these books I write, with lots of details and a need for visual accuracy, are difficult for any artist to draw. He makes it look so easy\\". In 2011 and 2012, Fern√°ndez illustrated several nonconsecutive New Mutants story arcs, written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning and published by Marvel Comics. In 2014 and 2015, Fern√°ndez illustrated the nine-issue limited series The Names, written by Peter Milligan and published by Vertigo. In an interview on the series, Milligan said \\"It's true that occasionally [Fern√°ndez] will try out a different way of doing something from how I've described it in the script. It's good when an intelligent and mindful artist does this, and it's even better when that artist is prepared to listen to feedback and maybe change things again. [...] Leo's always been nothing but professional, and only wants the best for the book\\". Also in 2015, Fern√°ndez with Riccardo Burchielli illustrated Mad Max: Fury Road - Nux and Immortan Joe #1, written by Mark Sexton, Nico Lathouris, George Miller and published by Vertigo. Jesse Schedeen, for IGN, wrote that \\"this issue features four different pencillers tackling different segments. These artists work together well in terms of achieving a unified visual tone. The problem is that the comic channels little of the film's frenetic energy or sense of style\\". The issue was in the top twenty of the \\"Apple iBooks US Bestseller List - Comics & Graphic Novels\\" for three weeks. In 2016, Fern√°ndez illustrated The Discipline, which was written by Peter Milligan and published by Image Comics. The Publishers Weekly review of The Discipline, Vol. 1: The Seduction trade paperback stated that \\"the artwork, both Fern√°ndez‚Äôs rendering and the colors by Cris Peter, are reminiscent of Hellboy and BPRD\\". In 2017, Fern√°ndez illustrated The Old Guard, which was written by Greg Rucka, colored by Daniela Miwa and published by Image Comics. In March 2017, Skydance Media picked up the rights to adapt the comic into a film. In 2018, Fern√°ndez began illustrating American Carnage, which was written by Bryan Hill and published by DC Vertigo as part of DC Entertainment's relaunch of Vertigo. Jim Dandy, for Den of Geek, wrote that \\"Fernandez‚Äôs art is stellar. The art feels a lot like Eduardo Risso‚Äôs on the surface, but there are some subtle differences that make it stand apart: the art in American Carnage is less blocky, which I think allows for a little more subtlety in expressions and body language\\". American Carnage ended with issue #9 in 2019 when DC Vertigo was shutdown. In December 2019, Fern√°ndez began illustrating the second volume of The Old Guard called The Old Guard: Force Multiplied. The Old Guard film was released on Netflix in July 2020. ==Bibliography== * X-Factor #142 (pencils, with Bill Rosemann and inks by Dan Green, Marvel Comics, 1998) *What If... #106 (pencils, with Tom DeFalco and inks by Robert Jones, Marvel Comics, 1998) *Maverick #9-11 (pencils, with Jorge Gonzales and inks by Andrew Pepoy, Marvel Comics, 1998) *Spider-Man's Tangled Web #16-17 (pencils and inks, with Daniel Way, Marvel Comics, 2002) * Queen & Country #8-12 (with Greg Rucka, Oni Press, 2002) * The Incredible Hulk #55-59 (with Bruce Jones, Marvel Comics, 2003) *Wolverine #7-11 (with Greg Rucka, Marvel Comics, 2004) * Punisher: MAX #7-12, 19-30, 37-42 (pencils, with Garth Ennis, Marvel Comics, 2004) *Daredevil Annual #1 (pencils, with Ande Parks and Ed Brubaker and inks by Scott Koblish, Marvel Comics, 2007) * Stormwatch: Post Human Division: Armageddon (pencils, with Christos Gage and inks by Francisco Paronzini, Wildstorm, 2008) * Stormwatch: Post Human Division #13-24 (pencils, with Ian Edginton and inks by Francisco Paronzini, Wildstorm, 2008-2010) * Northlanders #21-28 (with Brian Wood, Vertigo, 2009-2010) *X-Men Origins: Deadpool #1 (with Duane Swierczynski, Marvel Comics, 2010) *Deadpool & Cable #26 (with Duane Swierczynski, Marvel Comics, 2011) *5 Ronin #5 (with Peter Milligan, Marvel Comics, 2011) *New Mutants #25-27, 38-40, 44-46 (with Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, Marvel Comics, 2011-2012) *Spider-Island: Deadly Hands of Kung Fu #2-3 (co-pencils with Sebastian Fiumara, with Antony Johnston and inks by John Lucas, Marvel Comics, 2011) *Marvel Universe Vs.

(22 October 1604 ‚Äì 24 November 1665) was a Jesuit priest who became involved with the mission to the Hurons in the New World. Le Moyne had 16 years of education and experience in the priesthood in France before his arrival in Quebec in 1638. During that same year, he headed out to his mission in Huron country. The destruction of the Huron nation by the Iroquois brought him back to Quebec in 1650. He undertook numerous missions to the Iroquois at great risk to his personal safety. He is most notable in Canadian history for his work as an ambassador of peace to the Iroquois. ==Biography== Simon Le Moyne was born at Beauvais, France in 1604. He entered the Jesuit novitiate at Rouen on 10 December 1622 and studied philosophy at the Coll√®ge de Clermont in Paris (1624‚Äì27). He taught at Rouen from 1627 to 1632. Le Moyne was sent to Canada in 1638. He worked on the Huron mission with Pierre-Joseph-Marie Chaumonot and Francesco Giuseppe Bressani. Second only to Chaumonot in his mastery of the Huron-Iroquois language, he was unequaled in the knowledge of the character of the Indigenous people, their customs, and traditions. This made him well-suited to serve as ambassador in difficult matters.Lindsay, Lionel. \\"Simon Le Moyne.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 11 Jun. 2014 Around 1653, Le Moyne set out on an Iroquois Mission, at great risk, that would take him through the St. Lawrence valley and into Lake Ontario, where he would reach a fishing village at the mouth of the Oswego River in present-day New York State. From there, he traveled south to Onondaga Lake, home of the Onondaga, keepers of the council fire of the Iroquois Nation. After converting a large number of the Iroquois, including some chiefs, Le Moyne returned to Canada with a favorable report. He was assigned to several more missions, including work with the Mohawks.Corrigan, Michael. \\"Register of the Clergy Laboring in the Archdiocese of New York\\", Historical Records and Studies, Vol. 1, United States Catholic Historical Society, 1899 p. 22 Le Moyne was the first from Europe to discover the Salt Springs of Onondaga, near what is today Syracuse, New York. Le Moyne made a number of journeys into Mohawk territory in an effort to further peace negotiations. During 1657-1658 he journeyed from Ossernenon (Auriesville, N.Y.) to New Amsterdam (New York) to attend to the few Catholics residing there as well as some French sailors who had recently arrived in port with a prize.\\"Ecclesiastical Records\\", Documents of the Senate of the State of New York, Vol. 14, New York (State). Legislature. Senate, E. Croswell, 1902, p. 404 He paid a call on the Dutch Reformed minister Johannes Megapolensis, who had shown kindness to Father Isaac Jogues after Jogues had been ransomed from the Mohawks by Dutch traders from Fort Orange (Albany, N.Y.). Le Moyne was cordially received by Pastor Megapolensis, and arrived back in Quebec on 21 May 1658.Pouliot, L√©on. ‚ÄúLe Moyne, Simon\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 1, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003, accessed June 11, 2014 On 21 July 1661, Father Le Moyne went again to Iroquois territory to seek the release of French captives. He returned to Montreal on 31 Aug. 1662 with nineteen. His last journey appears to have been in 1662, when he returned to Quebec with a number of French who had been held captive by the Iroquois. He died of fever in 1665 at Cap de la Madeleine, near Three Rivers. ==Legacy== Le Moyne College is a Jesuit college located in Syracuse, New York and named after Simon Le Moyne. The Le Moyne College seal includes downturned arrowheads which symbolize his work on behalf of diplomacy and peace. It also depicts flowing waters, to symbolize both the ritual of baptism and Father Le Moyne's discovery of the value of the Onondaga salt springs. Since 1968 Le Moyne College has honored local and national figures with the \\"Simon Le Moyne Award\\" for outstanding leadership to the benefit of society.Le Moyne College ==ReferencesExternal links== * Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online * The Documentary History of the State of New York Category:1604 births Category:1665 deaths Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in Canada Category:17th-century French Jesuits Category:Jesuit missionaries in New France Category:French Roman Catholic missionaries Category:Le Moyne College Category:People from Beauvais ","title":"Simon Le Moyne"},{"id":"7444559","text":"Gary Mauer is an actor who most recently starred in the third national tour of The Phantom of the Opera playing the role of the Phantom.

An input that is known never to occur is a can't-happen term. Both these types of conditions are treated the same way in logic design and may be referred to collectively as don't-care conditions for brevity. The designer of a logic circuit to implement the function need not care about such inputs, but can choose the circuit's output arbitrarily, usually such that the simplest circuit results (minimization). Don't-care terms are important to consider in minimizing logic circuit design, including graphical methods like Karnaugh- Veitch maps and algebraic methods such as the Quine‚ÄìMcCluskey algorithm. == Examples == { style=\\"float:right\\" class= + Don't-care terms chosen to get minimal circuit - ! !! 00 !! 01 !! 11 !! 10 - ! 00     - ! 01     - ! 11     - ! 10     } { style=\\"float:right\\" class= + Karnaugh map for lower left segment - ! !! 00 !! 01 !! 11 !! 10 - ! 00     - ! 01     - ! 11     - ! 10     } { style=\\"float:right\\" class= + Digits in 7-segment display - ! !! 00 !! 01 !! 11 !! 10 - ! 00  x30px  x30px  x30px  x30px - ! 01  x30px  x30px  x30px  x30px - ! 11     - ! 10  x30px  x30px   } Examples of don't-care terms are the binary values 1010 through 1111 (10 through 15 in decimal) for a function that takes a binary-coded decimal (BCD) value, because a BCD value never takes on such values (so called pseudo- tetrades); in the pictures, the circuit computing the lower left bar of a 7-segment display can be minimized to by an appropriate choice of circuit outputs for . Write-only registers, as frequently found in older hardware, are often a consequence of don't-care optimizations in the trade-off between functionality and the number of necessary logic gates. Don't-care states can also occur in encoding schemes and communication protocols. == X value == \\"Don't care\\" may also refer to an unknown value in a multi-valued logic system, in which case it may also be called an X value or don't know. In the Verilog hardware description language such values are denoted by the letter \\"X\\". In the VHDL hardware description language such values are denoted (in the standard logic package) by the letter \\"X\\" (forced unknown) or the letter \\"W\\" (weak unknown). An X value does not exist in hardware. In simulation, an X value can result from two or more sources driving a signal simultaneously, or the stable output of a flip-flop not having been reached. In synthesized hardware, however, the actual value of such a signal will be either 0 or 1, but will not be determinable from the circuit's inputs. == Power-up states == Further considerations are needed for logic circuits that involve some feedback. That is, those circuits that depend on the previous output(s) of the circuit as well as its current external inputs. Such circuits can be represented by a state machine. It is sometimes possible that some states that are nominally can't-happen conditions can accidentally be generated during power-up of the circuit or else by random interference (like cosmic radiation, electrical noise or heat). This is also called forbidden input. In some cases, there is no combination of inputs that can exit the state machine into a normal operational state. The machine remains stuck in the power-up state or can be moved only between other can't-happen states in a walled garden of states. This is also called a hardware lockup or soft error. Such states, while nominally can't-happen, are not don't-care, and designers take steps either to ensure that they are really made can't-happen, or else if they do happen, that they create a don't-care alarm indicating an emergency state for error detection, or they are transitory and lead to a normal operational state. == See also == * Decision table * Side effect * Short-circuit evaluation * Incomplete address decoding * Incomplete opcode decoding * Logic redundancy == Notes  References Further reading== * (1191 pages) Category:Logic ","title":"Don't-care term"},{"id":"7444608","text":"Kornstad is a village in Aver√∏y Municipality in M√∏re og Romsdal county, Norway.

It is the most populous governorate in Syria with a population of more than 4,867,000 (2011 Est.), almost 23% of the total population of Syria. The governorate is the fifth in area with an area of , or 18,498 sq. km, about 10% of the total area of Syria. The capital is the city of Aleppo. ==HistoryAncient=== In Classical Antiquity, the region was made up of three regions: Chalybonitis (with its centre at Chalybon or Aleppo), Chalcidice (with its center at Qinnasrƒ´n ÿßŸÑÿπŸäÿ≥), and Cyrrhestica (with its center at Cyrrhus ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ®Ÿä ÿ≠Ÿàÿ±Ÿä). This was the most fertile and populated region in Syria. Under the Romans the region was made in 193 CE part of the province of Coele Syria or Magna Syria, which was ruled from Antioch. The province of Euphratensis was established in the 4th century CE in the east, its centre was Hierapolis Bambyce (Manbij). Under the Rashidun and Umayyad Muslim dynasties, the region was part of the Jund Qinnasrin. In the Abbasid period the region was under the independent rule of the Hamdanids. The Mamluks and then later the Ottomans governed the area until 1918; under the Ottomans, the region was part of the Vilayet of Aleppo. ===Modern history=== During the French Mandate the region was part of the short-lived State of Aleppo.Syria: French Levant States 1920-1936 Aleppo Governorate formerly included Idlib Governorate, until the latter was split off circa 1960. ===Syrian Civil War (2011-present)=== The governorate has been the scene of some of the fiercest fighting in the Syrian Civil War. In June 2017, nearly six years after the war's start, the province was almost equally divided between Syrian Government forces, Syrian Opposition forces, Turkish Army /TFSA and the Rojava/Syrian Democratic Forces. After fierce fighting, the Syrian Arab Army with Russian air support managed to take control of the capital of the Governorate, Aleppo, in December 2016 from Fatah Halab coalition. In August 2016, the Turkish Army, backed by the Free Syrian Army launched the Operation Euphrates Shield in order to drive ISIL from the border towns of Jarablus, A'zaz and Al-Bab. The operation resulted in success and starting in May 2017, the region is now under Turkish occupation. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant was largely removed from the area after the Syrian Arab Army launched the East Aleppo Offensive, the Maskanah Plains offensive, and the Southern Raqqa Offensive. In January 2018, the Turkish army backed by the Free Syrian Army launched the Turkish military operation in Afrin against the YPG, which resulted in the capture of the city of Afrin and the entire Afrin District. ==Geography== The governorate has a long northern boundary with the Kilis, Gaziantep, and ≈ûanlƒ±urfa provinces of Turkey. To the east lies Raqqa Governorate, to the south ·∏§amƒÅ Governorate, and to the west Idlib Governorate and Turkey's Hatay Province. The governorate lies on a plateau known as the Aleppo plateau. The eastern and northern boundaries of the governorate correspond roughly to the eastern and northern boundaries of the plateau, although the northeastern portion of the governorate crosses the Euphrates valley into the Jazƒ´rah plateau. The southeastern end of the governorate is continuous with the arid steppe of the northern Syrian Desert. To the south lie the eastern plains of Hama, and to the southwest lie the northern plains of Idlib. The average elevation of the terrain is . The surface gradually slopes down in north‚Äìsouth and west‚Äìeast directions, undulating gently with an amplitude of 10‚Äì30 m for each wave. The lowlands are covered with combined Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments that average 4‚Äì5 km in thickness over the whole surface.Abd as-Salam, Adil (1991) General Geography of Syria (Arabic) Geographic features of northern Syria Starting from the valley of the Euphrates, the terrain rises forming the Manbij plain and then sinks again at the Dhahab river valley in the east of Aleppo Governorate. The Dhahab drains the highlands north of BƒÅb and runs in a north‚Äìsouth direction for about until it drains into Lake Jabboul. West of the Dhahab valley the terrain rises again forming Mount  ªAqƒ´l (Mount Taymar) west of BƒÅb and Mount ·∏§a·π£·π£ west of Lake Jabboul.\\"SY006: Sabkhat al-Jabbul\\" BirdLife IBA Factsheet The terrain sinks again forming the valley of River Quwƒìq. The endpoint of Quwƒìq, the Ma·π≠kh swamp (), is the lowest point in Aleppo Governorate. West of the Quwƒìq is Mount Simeon. South of Mount Simeon are the plains of Idlib. The River  ªAfrƒ´n runs west of Mount Simeon. To the west of River  ªAfrƒ´n the land rises again forming Mount Kurd. The highest point in the governorate, Mount Bulbul (), is located in the northern part of Mount Kurd. River  ªIfrƒ´n runs from north to south between Mount Simeon and Mount Kurd and then turns west to the Orontes valley, thus separating Mount Kurd from Mount ·∏§ƒÅrim to the south. The governorate is generally deforested except for a dispersed forest of about on the eastern slope of Mount Kurd where it faces the plain of A ªzƒÅz. The main trees are Aleppo Pine and oak. Arable land makes up 66% of the total area in the governorate. The main crops are olives, figs, plums, pomegranates, vegetables, grains, rice, and pistachios. Pistachio is called in Syria fustuq ·∏§alabƒ´ (Aleppo pistachio). Agriculture was traditionally supported by rivers; the main rivers in Aleppo are the Quwƒìq,  ªIfrƒ´n, SƒÅj≈´r, Dhahab, Aswad, and Euphrates. However, all of these rivers arise in Turkey, and due to irrigation projects on the Turkish side of the border the flow of these rivers dropped so much that most of them could no longer support agriculture. The Quwƒìq, for example, dried up completely in the 1950s. The vanishing of the rivers forced farmers to depend largely on rainfall and on water diverted from the Euphrates. A pumping station at Maskanah (95 km east of Aleppo) provides drinking water for Aleppo from the Euphrates. Recently Euphrates water has been diverted to revive the dead Qwƒìq river, and thus revive agriculture in the plains south of Aleppo. Urban areas, highlands, swamps, forests, and grazing land make up 34% of the total area of the governorate. The remaining 14% is a desert area in the southeast that is continuous with the Syrian Desert and known as the Aleppo Desert (Arabic: ÿ®ÿßÿØŸäÿ© ÿ≠ŸÑÿ®). The largest lake in the governorate is Lake Jabboul, a Ramsar salt lake located southeast of Aleppo. Lake Assad (the largest lake in Syria) separates Aleppo Governorate from Raqqa Governorate. Other artificial lakes include the Lake of 17 April on the River  ªIfrƒ´n and the revived ShabƒÅ º Lake on River Quwƒìq. Archaeological sites are abundant in the governorate, especially at Mount Simeon in the west and the plains that extend beyond towards Antioch and Idlib. This region, known as the Limestone Massif, has the largest concentration of Late Antiquity churches in the world, with a unique Syrian architectural style. It also has the famous Dead Cities of Syria.Darke, Diana (2006) Syria p.132 ===Cities=== Aleppo city hall, the seat of the governorate and the city council The following cities are the administrative centres of the districts in Aleppo Governorate (Population based on 2004 official census): {  - !

The character became popular in 2005 from his role in a viral video of game footage where, having been absent during his group's discussion of a meticulous plan, Leeroy returns and ruins it by charging straight into combat shouting his own name. The character became an Internet meme. ==Video== The original video was released by the World of Warcraft player guild \\"Pals for Life\\" to video-sharing site Warcraftmovies on May 11, 2005. The video features a group of players discussing a detailed battle plan for their next encounter while Leeroy is away from his computer, preparing a plate of chicken. This plan is intended to help Leeroy obtain a piece of armor from the boss monsters, but is ruined when Leeroy himself returns and, ignorant of the strategy, immediately rushes headlong into battle shouting his own name in a stylized battle cry. His companions rush to help, but Leeroy's actions ruin the detailed plan and all the members of the group are killed. (The plan was deeply flawed even before Leeroy ruined it, containing several critical misunderstandings of the then- current game mechanics.) The Internet meme started with the release of the video clip called A Rough Go to the World of Warcraft game forum in a thread titled \\"UBRS (vid) Rookery Overpowered! blue plz.\\", which presented the video in a serious context. The thread requested that other players provide help with strategy and that Blizzard reduce the difficulty of the encounter. The video spread as an Internet meme, and Leeroy's response to the other players' chastisements, \\"at least I have chicken\\", was also much mimicked. When in April 2008 he was asked about his actions in the video by National Public Radio, Ben Schulz said the players \\"were drinking 40s and just yelling at each other.\\" As time went on, some began suggesting that the video may have been staged. Schulz had refused to confirm or deny whether the video was staged. Later, in December 2017, Schulz, along with Ben \\"Anfrony\\" Vinson, the cameraman of the video, released what he described as a first take/dry run of the video. Regarding the video, Vinson stated, \\"We didn‚Äôt think anyone would believe it was real, we thought it was so obviously satire.\\" ==Merchandise== The character's popularity resulted in his inclusion in the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game released on October 25, 2006, with art by Mike Krahulik. A \\"Leeroy Jenkins\\" Legendary card was later released in Blizzard's online card game Hearthstone, as part of the game's base (\\"Classic\\") set, and using the same art as that of the WoW TCG. Upper Deck Entertainment released a World of Warcraft Miniatures game in late 2008, which included a Leeroy Jenkins figurine. As a reference to Leeroy's famous claim, the figure is seen holding a chicken leg in his left hand. ==Reaction== The May 2005 issue of PC Gamer UK featured an article on the video, titled \\"The Ballad of Leeroy Jenkins\\". The article took the position that the video was designed as a negative commentary on the kind of \\"nerd-guilds\\" whose members fastidiously plan raids with all the seriousness of actual military tacticians. They added that they felt Leeroy is the hero acting against the geekiness of his guild. Blizzard eventually paid tribute to Leeroy within World of Warcraft itself creating the achievement \\"Leeeeeeeeeeeeeroy!\\", which awards the title of \\"Jenkins\\" to players who kill 50 of the rookery whelps from the video within 15 seconds. Also, in the new expansion Warlords of Draenor, Leeroy returns as a non-player character and will join the player's garrison if they help him find the Devout Shoulders he was seeking in the video. Blizzard also added a \\"Leeroy Jenkins\\" card to their popular online card game Hearthstone. When entering the battlefield, Leeroy gives his famous battle cry. While attacking, he says \\"Time‚Äôs up, let's do this!\\" And when he dies, he says, \\"At least I have chicken.\\" In addition, the adventure mode \\"Blackrock Mountain\\" added a new game board themed on the mountain. In the bottom right section, there is a pink tabard with a white heart lying on the ground, a reference to the guild Leeroy was in, . Leeroy Jenkins went mainstream when he was mentioned as part of a clue on the November 16, 2005, episode of the game show Jeopardy! as part of their college week tournament, though no contestant rang in.Jeopardy! November 16, 2005. Jeopary! round: Computer gaming category - 1000$. J! Archive. Retrieved September 26, 2016. The meme spread further in 2009 when the Armed Forces Journal published an article titled \\"Let's Do This!: Leeroy Jenkins and the American Way of Advising\\". The article, by Capt. Robert M Chamberlain links Jenkins to the American approach to advising the indigenous armed forces in Iraq. ==Other appearances== *In the 2007 video game Mass Effect, a character named \\"Richard L.

Notes on the Rock Carvings in the Edakal Caves, Wynaad. The Indian Antiquary vol. XXX, pp. 409-421., are two natural caves at Edakkal, in Wayanad district of Kerala. The caves are situated above sea level on Ambukutty Mala, on the Mysore Plateau, in the Western Ghats. The Edakkal caves are believed to be camping shelters of the Neolithic community (the south Indian Neolithic culture zone). The cave walls contain a collection of Neolithic rock engravings and images (which were incised over a period of time). The major part of images on the cave walls may belong to late Neolithic period (i. e., first millennium BC). With the exception of Edakkal, no concrete evidence for the existence of a true Neolithic culture in Kerala has so far been discovered. The caves were discovered by Fred Fawcett, Superintendent of Police, Malabar District in 1896 who immediately recognised their anthropological and historical importance. He published an article (1901) about the caves in the Indian Antiquary (Volume 30), attracting the attention of scholars. The caverns at Edakkal are not technically caves, but rather a cleft, rift or rock shelter approximately by , a fissure caused by a piece of rock splitting away from the main body. On one side of the cleft is a rock weighing several tons that covers the cleft to form the \\"roof\\" of the cave. ==Image gallery== File:Edakkal Stone Age Carving.jpg File:Prehistoric petroglyphs in the Edakkal Caves Wayanad Kerala India 24.jpg File:Edakkal_Caves_-_Views_from_and_around_2019_(101).jpg File:View from the Edakkal caves.jpgView of surroundings from Edakkal Caves File:Edakkal_caves_(30).JPGMedieval inscription File:Kadamba inscription from Kerala.jpgPrakrit Grantha inscription of Kadamba ruler Vishnuvarman (c. 5th-6th century CE) == Kadamba inscription in Edakkal == * A short Tamil- Brahmi inscription, containing the word Chera (\\"Kadummi Pudha Chera\\"), was found at Edakkal. * An undated Prakrit-Grantha inscription of Kadamba king Vishnu Varma was recovered from the Edakkal Cave.

The Association defines itself as follows: ‚Ä≥The objective of the National Black police Association (NBPA) is to promote good race relations and equality of opportunity within the police services of the United Kingdom and the wider community. What does the NBPA do ? The NBPA works to place fairness at the heart of the Police Agenda. We do this by taking forward initiatives for the Progression of minority officers and staff ; such as mentoring schemes, leadership programmes, women in policing projects supported by the National Institute for Leadership and Empowerment. The NBPA has a high Profile within the Home Office and Government Strategic Committees. As well as members of a range of decision-making steering groups, we have regular meetings with the all policing stakeholders.‚Ä≥ The NBPA does not have individual membership. It is made up by BPAs who each elect a representative to participate at national level on the National Executive Committee (NEC). The NBPA has been criticised as a racist organisation because of its selective membership criteria based on ethnic origin. ==Black Police Association== The first Black Police Association (BPA) was the Metropolitan Black Police Association, founded in 1994 as a joint initiative between BME police staff within the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS). This joint initiative raised concerns about the number of black staff who were leaving police forces throughout the UK. A meeting of BME staff from the MPS, known as the Bristol Seminars, led to the formation of a black support network, which formally became the UK's first Black Police Association in September 1994, launched by the MPS Commissioner Sir Paul Condon. At the launch, Sir Paul Condon said: \\"I have made it clear where I stand. I see the formation of this Association as the only way forward.\\" On 12 and 13 October 2006, Boalt Hall, Berkeley, University of California hosted an international, multidisciplinary roundtable on the role of rank-and-file officers in police reform.http://www.law.berkeley.edu/centers/bccj/conferences/policereform/index.html/ The roundtable was co-sponsored by the Berkeley Center for Criminal Justice, the Center for the Study of Law & Society, and the Regulatory Institutions Network at Australian National University. Included in the list of invited contributors was Superintendent Paul Wilson, Metropolitan Police Service, London, who presented his paper entitled \\"The development and role of a Black Police Association in the wider police modernisation agenda\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070610060734/http://www.law.berkeley.edu/centers/bccj/conferences/policereform/Wilson%20paper.doc which serves as a useful insight into the socio-political beginnings of the UK's first black police association. ==Controversy and criticism== Ali Dizaei, the former National President of National Black Police Association, was jailed for perverting the course of justice in February 2010. Anjana Ahuja a British Asian reporter for The Times criticised the organisation for its vocal defence of Dizaei and called for its disbandment, calling it \\"pointless and possibly harmful\\", asking, \\"why partition members of the same profession along the lines of skin colour?.A black police association is a bad, outdated idea Why partition members of the same profession along the lines of skin colour?, The Times Whereas Minette Marrin called the NBPA \\"racism in action\\" saying \\"if anything is institutionally racist, in the strict sense of the term, it is the existence of the NBPA itself: it is a separatist union for officers who call themselves black.\\"A black police association ‚Äì now that is racism in action, The Times Conservative MP David Davies criticised the organisation, while speaking as a guest at a NBPA meeting, for not allowing white people to become full members, saying: \\"To me it is a shame that full membership of the BPA is open only to those of black, Asian or Middle Eastern origin.\\". ==National Communication Network== In October 1996, a National Communication Network was formed. This network included BME police staff members throughout the UK, and soon after its formation, members of the network resolved that a national association of BME police staff members should be formed, with the motto: \\"One voice, strength in unity\\". In early 1998, four representatives of the National Communication Network met with Home Secretary Jack Straw. Three representatives from the Metropolitan Police BPA, The chairman, Paul Wilson, Executive members Leroy Logan MBE and Bevan Powell MBE were accompanied by Ravi Chand QPM Chairman of the Bedfordshire Police BPA. It was at this meeting that the Home Secretary volunteered to speak at the Met BPA Annual General Meeting, an offer which was accepted by the chairman, Paul Wilson. From this initial meeting and other meetings between the Home Office and representatives of the National Communications Network, in November 1998, the first interim executive committee of the National Black Police Association was elected to launch the NBPA. The executive committee had 14 executive members from 12 Constabularies. In October 2009 Charles Crichlow, a Greater Manchester Police Officer, was elected President of the NBPA. In October 2013 a new Cabinet was elected. Franstine Jones, a Suffolk member of police staff was elected as the NBPA's first female President, with Nick Glynn (Leicestershire) being elected as Vice-President. == References External links== * Official website ==See also== * Black British * Black people * Racism within the British police Category:Law enforcement in the United Kingdom Category:Black British history Category:1999 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Organizations established in 1999 ","title":"National Black Police Association (United Kingdom)"},{"id":"7444743","text":"Mika Antero Helin (born 7 April 1978) is a Finnish retired footballer.

She was the mother of Louis, Margrave of Baden-Baden, the famous chief commander of the Imperial army. ==Biography== Louise was born at the H√¥tel de Soissons in Paris. The H√¥tel was the birthplace of her mother, a granddaughter of Louis de Bourbon, an uncle of Henry IV of France. Her father was Prince Thomas Francis of Savoy, the younger son of the Duke of Savoy and his Spanish wife, Infanta Catherine Michelle of Spain. She married Margrave Ferdinand Maximilian of Baden-Baden (1625‚Äì1669) on 15 March 1653 at the √âglise Saint-Sulpice, Paris, France. The church was near the H√¥tel de Soissons. The marriage contract was signed on the same day and is today preserved in the Parisian Institut de France. This marriage was negotiated by none other than the famous Cardinal Mazarin and the Ambassador of the Margrave of Baden-Baden one Monsieur Krebs. Her husband was the Hereditary Prince of Baden-Baden, this meant that he was the Heir apparent of his father Wilhelm, Margrave of Baden- Baden. Marriages between German and Savoyard nobles were common in an era when many Savoyard nobles lived in German states notably Baden itself, due to official charges in the country. The marriage was not successful. Louise Christine of Savoy refused to leave the refined French court and follow her husband to Baden-Baden. Louise Christine gave birth to a son on April 8, 1655 named Louis William of Baden-Baden. He was named after the French King Louis XIV, who was his godfather. Ferdinand Maximilian then abducted his son from Paris and brought him to Baden-Baden. Ferdinand ordered a Savoyard man named Charles Maurice de Lassolaye, who had access to the H√¥tel de Soissons, to smuggle his three-month-old son out of Paris and take him to be raised in Baden-Baden. As a consequence Louis William was not raised by his mother, but by his grandfather's second wife Maria Magdalena of Oettingen-Baldern. When it was clear that Louise Christine would not leave Paris, some said due to the influence of her mother, Louise Christine and her husband decided to separate and let her son be raised in Baden-Baden. She died in Paris aged 61. Her descendants included the present Henri d'Orl√©ans, French pretender; the Prince Napol√©on; Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza and his distant cousin Prince Luiz of Orl√©ans-Braganza. She is also an ancestor of the ruling Felipe VI of Spain, Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg and Albert II of Belgium. ==Ancestors== Category:1627 births Category:1689 deaths Category:People from Paris Category:Princesses of Savoy Category:Hereditary Princesses of Baden-Baden Category:House of Z√§hringen Category:French people of Spanish descent Category:French people of Italian descent Category:French people of Portuguese descent Category:French people of English descent Category:French people of Polish descent Category:French people of Austrian descent Category:House of Savoy-Carignano ","title":"Princess Louise of Savoy"},{"id":"7444824","text":"__NOTOC__ Lock and Dam No. 18 is a lock and dam located near Gladstone, Illinois and Burlington, Iowa on the Upper Mississippi River around river mile 410.5.

The lock and dam obliterated the Des Moines Rapids which had effectively been the northern barrier for traffic on the Mississippi until efforts began in 1837 to address the Mississippi's depth in the rapids. { align=\\"right\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20161226221158/http://www.mvr.usace.army.mil/Portals/48/docs/CC/FactSheets/MISS/UMR%20Locks%20%26%20Dams%20-%202016%20%28MVD%29.pdf } ==Locks== Aerial view of the locks at Lock and Dam 19. The 1957 lock is the largest at left, with the dewatered drydock and 1913 lock at its right. The old Keokuk Rail Bridge and Keokuk-Hamilton Bridge are visible in the foreground. View is upriver to the northeast. The main lock was constructed from 1952 to 1957 and is long and wide with a lift of just over and large enough to handle a full-length tow of barges. It was put into operation in 1957 at a cost of 13.5 million dollars. The 1957 lock replaced a 1910-1913 lock. The 1913 lock was a variant of the standardized Panama Canal design and was wide, long and tall with a lift. There was a wide, long and deep dry dock at the site, both the dry dock and 1913 lock were dewatered in 1977 when a sheet pile and cell closure were built blocking the upstream sides of the lock and dry dock.HAER - Mississippi River 9-Foot Channel, Lock & Dam No. 19, Upper Mississippi River, Keokuk, Lee County, IA The lock and dam, as well as the rest of the river, can be viewed from a distance on the Observation Deck of the Keokuk Rail Bridge. ==Dam== Upstream side of the dam, showing installed gates. Construction of the dam began in 1910, and was completed in 1913. The movable portion of the dam is long with 119 separate rectangular, steel-skin plated, sliding gates. The gates are either installed or removed and river flow is controlled by the number of gates installed. They are removed by a gantry crane that travels on the service bridge above the dam. At the time it was completed it was second in length only to the Aswan Low Dam on the Nile River. ==Powerhouse== Keokuk Power Plant, formerly owned by Union Electric, now AmerenUE. Construction began in 1910 and when completed in 1913 it was the largest capacity, single powerhouse electricity generating plant in the world. The Power House and spillways are owned and operated by Ameren Missouri and has a 142 MW capacity.https://www.ameren.com/AboutUs/ADC_AU_FactSheet.pdf The powerhouse contains 15 generators, originally designed to produce 25 Hz instead of the 60 Hz alternating current used today. Keokuk and Hamilton Water Power landed contracts in 1910 to deliver 44.7 MW of electricity to three customers located in St. Louis, MO (more than 100 miles downstream), at a time when no electric power had been transmitted more than a few miles: The Union Electric Light and Power Company, Laclede Gas Company and United Railways Company, which operated the St. Louis Street Railway Company. Union Electric Co. purchased the facilities in 1925. The 25 Hz generators powered industrial customers and used for the Streetcars in St. Louis, Missouri. After World War II, a number of modernization improvements were undertaken. The 25-cycle generators were progressively converted to 60-cycle generators beginning in 1940s with the final units converted in 2002. Electronic automation replacement for some mechanical systems began in 1980s. Ameren Missouri, the current powerhouse owner, began replacement and conversion of the original 1913 turbines with more efficient stainless steel turbines. Today, Keokuk Energy Center remains the largest privately owned and operated dam on the Mississippi River. In addition to Lock and Dam No. 19, Lock and Dam No. 1, Lock and Dam No. 2 and the upper St. Anthony Falls dam also produce electricity on the Mississippi River system. ==See also== View of the bullnose of the Des Moines rapids canal, the last remaining part of the c.1870s canal, demolished c.1910.

Active from 1937 until 1958, the cartoon studio created some popular cartoon characters, including Tom and Jerry, Droopy and Barney Bear. Prior to forming its own cartoon studio, MGM released the work of independent animation producer Ub Iwerks, and later the Happy Harmonies series from Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising. The MGM cartoon studio was founded to replace Harman and Ising, although both men eventually became employees of the studio. After a slow start, the studio began to take off in 1940 after its short The Milky Way became the first non-Disney cartoon to win the Academy Award for Best Short Subjects: Cartoons. The studio's roster of talent benefited from an exodus of animators from the Warner Bros. Cartoons and Disney studios, which were facing issues with union workers. Originally established and run by executive Fred Quimby, in 1955 William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, the writer- directors of the Tom and Jerry cartoons, became the heads of the studio. The cartoon studio was closed on August 1, 1958, at which time Hanna and Barbera took much of the staff to form their own company, Hanna-Barbera Productions. == Early years == To promote their films and attract larger theater audiences, motion picture chains in the 1930s provided many features to supplement the main feature, including travelogues, serials, short comedy subjects, newsreels and cartoons. During the late 1920s, Walt Disney Productions had achieved huge popular and critical success with their Mickey Mouse cartoons for Pat Powers' Celebrity Pictures (distributing for Columbia Pictures). Several other studios, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer among them, took note of Disney's success and began to look for ways to get Disney or compete. MGM's first foray into animation was the Flip the Frog cartoon series, starring an anthropomorphic talking and singing frog. The series was produced independently for Celebrity Pictures by Ub Iwerks, formerly the head animator at the Disney studio. Celebrity Pictures' Pat Powers had hired Iwerks away from Disney with the promise of giving Iwerks his own studio, and was able to secure a distribution deal with MGM for the Flip the Frog cartoons. The first Flip the Frog cartoon, Fiddlesticks, was released in August 1930,Barrier, Michael. Hollywood Cartoons, p. 165. and over two-dozen other Flip cartoons followed during the next three years. In 1933, the Flip character was dropped in favor of Willie Whopper, a new series featuring a lie-telling little boy. Willie Whopper failed to catch on, and MGM terminated its distribution deal with Iwerks and Powers, who had already begun distributing their Comi-Color cartoons on their own.Barrier, Michael. Hollywood Cartoons, p. 167. Barrier notes that Iwerks and Powers released the first ComiColor cartoon, Jack and the Beanstalk, in December 1933, nine months before the final Willie Whopper cartoon was released to theatres. In February 1934 MGM signed a new deal with the Harman- Ising studio, which had just broken ties with producer Leon Schlesinger and the Warner Bros. studio over budget concerns, to work on a new series of high- budget color cartoons.Barrier, Michael. Hollywood Cartoons, p. 188. The director team brought with them much of their staff from their time with Schlesinger, including animators and storymen such as Carmen \\"Max\\" Maxwell, William Hanna, and brothers Robert and Tom McKimson.Maltin, Leonard. Of Mice and Magic, p. 281 (The McKimsons would later return to Schlesinger.) Also following Harman and Ising from Schlesinger was Bosko, a successful character the duo had created for the Warner cartoons. The first entry in MGM's new Happy Harmonies cartoon series, The Discontented Canary, was completed in June 1934 and released in September. The series continued for three years, moving from two-strip to three-strip Technicolor in 1935. The Happy Harmonies canon included a handful of entries starring Bosko, who by 1935 had been redesigned from an ambiguous \\"inkspot\\" character into a discernible little African- American boy.Maltin, Leonard. Of Mice and Magic, p. 280-281 The directors worked separately on their own films, although both strived to create intricate films that would compete with Disney's award-winning Silly Symphonies.Barrier, Michael. Hollywood Cartoons, p. 189. However, budget problems threatened to plague Harman and Ising a second time: Happy Harmonies cartoons regularly ran over budget, and Hugh Harman paid no heed to MGM's demands that he reduce the costs of the shorts.Barrier, Michael. Hollywood Cartoons, p. 190. MGM retaliated in February 1937 by deciding to open their own cartoon studio, and hired away most of the Harman-Ising staff to do so.Barrier, Michael. Hollywood Cartoons, p. 192.Maltin, Leonard. Of Mice and Magic, p. 283 The final Happy Harmonies short, The Little Bantamweight, was released in March 1938, and Harman and Ising went on to establish a new studio to do freelance animation work for Walt Disney, only to come back. For the 1934 MGM musical film Hollywood Party, Walt Disney Productions created an animated sequence in Technicolor called The Hot Choc-Late Soldiers, and is one of a few examples where Disney produced animation for other studios. The movie also contained a sequence with Jimmy Durante interacting with an animated Mickey Mouse. In 1936, Disney's animators were overworked with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and the Harman-Ising studio provided artists to work on the feature and the Silly Symphonies short Merbabies in exchange to artist training. == Golden age of American animation  Early years (1937‚Äì1939) === In March 1937, MGM hired film sales executive Fred Quimby, a man with no experience in the animation industry, to set up and run the new MGM cartoon department. Among the holdovers from the Harman-Ising regime, William Hanna and Bob Allen were appointed as directors, and Carmen Maxwell became production manager. Quimby raided every major American animation studio for talent, extracting artists, directors, and writers from studios, such as Friz Freleng from Leon Schlesinger Productions, Emery Hawkins from Screen Gems, and much of the top staff at Terrytoons (Joseph Barbera, Jack Zander, Ray Kelly, Dan Gordon, George Gordon, and others). After spending some time headquartered in a nearby house, the new MGM cartoon studio at Overland Ave. and Montana Ave. opened its doors on August 23, 1937.Barrier, Michael. Hollywood Cartoons, p. 288. Although it boasted a brand-new facility and good directors, the MGM cartoon studio's first series was a failure. The Captain and the Kids, adapted from Rudolph Dirks' Katzenjammer Kids characters, was licensed by MGM without input from its then-forming creative staff.Maltin, Leonard. Of Mice and Magic, p. 283-284 Freleng, Hanna, and Allen, assigned to direct the Captain and the Kids cartoons, were unable to translate the Katzenjammer humor into animation, and the series folded after fifteen episodes. Only two of the Captain and the Kids shorts were produced in Technicolor; the other thirteen were produced in black-and-white and released in sepia-toned prints. === Harman and Ising return (1938‚Äì1943) === MGM brought in established newspaper cartoonists such as Milt Gross and Harry Hershfield in an attempt to both bolster the Captain and the Kids product and create original properties for MGM, but both cartoonists' tenures at the studio were short-lived. Gross managed to complete two cartoons, Jitterbug Follies and Wanted: No Master, with his characters Count Screwloose of Tooloose and J.R. the Wonder Dog, while Hershfield completed no cartoons. In October 1938, Quimby, coming full-circle, hired Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising as the new creative heads of the studio, acting as both directors and producers, and in charge of many of the employees who had defected from the Harman-Ising studio a year before.Barrier, Michael. Hollywood Cartoons, p. 291. Among Ising's first new cartoons for MGM was 1939's The Bear Who Couldn't Sleep, the debut appearance of Barney Bear, a lumbering anthropomorphic bear based upon both Wallace Beery and Ising himself. Barney Bear would become MGM's first original cartoon star, regularly featured in cartoons until 1953, although his popularity never rose to the level of Mickey Mouse or Porky Pig. Ising focused on the Barney Bear cartoons, while Harman focused on making intricately animated one-shot cartoons, although Harman was able to establish a short-lived series of Three Bears cartoons. At this time, Harman created his masterwork, Peace on Earth. Released during the holiday season of 1939 (immediately after the outbreak of World War II in Europe), Peace on Earth was a serious work which dealt with the idea of what a post-apocalyptic world would be like. Peace on Earth was nominated for the 1939 Academy Award for Short Subjects (Cartoons), as well as for the Nobel Peace Prize. === Hanna-Barbera: Tom and Jerry (1939‚Äì1958) === Friz Freleng, briefly assigned to work under Harman, returned to Schlesinger after his MGM contract expired in April 1939,Barrier, Michael. Hollywood Cartoons, p. 292. and storyman Joseph Barbera was united with director William Hanna to co-direct cartoons for Rudolf Ising's unit. The partnership between Hanna and Barbera would last for more than six decades, until Hanna's death in 2001. The duo's first cartoon together was 1940's Puss Gets the Boot, featuring an unnamed mouse's attempts to outwit a housecat named Jasper. Though released without fanfare, the short was financially and critically successful, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Short Subject (Cartoons) of 1940. On the strength of the Oscar nomination and public demand, Hanna and Barbera were assigned to direct more cat-and-mouse cartoons, soon christening the characters Tom and Jerry. Puss Gets the Boot did not win the 1940 Academy Award for Best Cartoon, but another MGM cartoon, Rudolf Ising's The Milky Way did, making MGM the first studio to wrestle the Cartoon Academy Award away from Walt Disney.Barrier, Michael. Hollywood Cartoons, p. 300. Tom & Jerry quickly became MGM's most valuable animated property. The shorts were successful at the box office, many licensed products (comic books, toys, etc.) were released to the market, and the series would earn twelve more Academy Award for Short Subjects (Cartoons) nominations, with seven of the Tom & Jerry shorts going on to win the Academy Award: The Yankee Doodle Mouse (1943), Mouse Trouble (1944), Quiet Please! (1945), The Cat Concerto (1946), The Little Orphan (1948), The Two Mouseketeers (1951), and Johann Mouse (1952). Tom & Jerry was eventually tied with Disney's Silly Symphonies as the most- awarded theatrical cartoon series. Originally barred by Quimby from making a second cat-and-mouse short until the overwhelming success of Puss Gets the Boot demanded it, Hanna and Barbera and their team of animators, who included George Gordon, Jack Zander, Kenneth Muse, Irven Spence, Ed Barge, Ray Patterson and Pete Burness, worked on nothing but Tom & Jerry cartoons from 1941 until 1955. Exceptions were half a dozen one-shot theatrical shorts, including Gallopin' Gals (1940), Officer Pooch (1941), War Dogs (1943), We Wish You a Merry Christmas, Good Will to Men (1955), and the last seven Tex Avery shorts featuring Droopy. Key to the successes of Tom and Jerry and other MGM cartoons was the work of Scott Bradley, who scored virtually all of the cartoons for the studio from 1934 to 1957. Bradley's scores made use of both classical and jazz sensibilities. In addition, he often used songs from the scores of MGM's feature films, the most frequent of them being \\"The Trolley Song\\" from Meet Me in St. Louis and \\"Sing Before Breakfast\\" from Broadway Melody of 1936.Maltin, Leonard. Of Mice and Magic, p. 290 === Tex Avery (1941‚Äì1957) === Jerky Turkey by Tex Avery Hugh Harman left the MGM studio in April 1943, and Rudolph Ising departed eighteen months later.Barrier, Michael. Hollywood Cartoons, p. 301. George Gordon took over Ising's department, continuing work on the Barney Bear cartoons, but only completed three cartoons before he left the studio in 1943. In Harman's place, Quimby hired Tex Avery, an animation director known for his wild comedic style at the Schlesinger studio. Avery's first short for MGM was the World War II parody Blitz Wolf, which was nominated for the 1942 Academy Award for Short Subjects (Cartoons). While Avery had revolutionized cartoon humor at Schlesinger's, he went several steps further in his MGM works. Avery exaggerated his characters and situations wildly, and was noted for the precise and hard-edged timing of his gags.Maltin, Leonard. Of Mice and Magic, p. 296 Among Avery's most noted cartoons for MGM were slapstick comedies such as Red Hot Riding Hood (1943), Jerky Turkey (1945), Northwest Hounded Police (1946), King-Size Canary (1947), Little Rural Riding Hood (1949), and Bad Luck Blackie (1949).These cartoons comprise the Avery-directed MGM cartoons listed in the Jerry Beck-edited book of The 50 Greatest Cartoons. (1994, Atlanta: Turner Publishing). While Avery preferred to focus on gags instead of characterization, he established several popular MGM cartoon characters, including Screwball \\"Screwy\\" Squirrel, the Of Mice and Men derived pair of George and Junior, and his best-known character, Droopy.http://sf-encyclopedia.uk/fe.php?nm=avery_tex Droopy, voiced by Bill Thompson (a.k.a. \\"Wallace Wimple\\" on NBC Radio's Fibber McGee and Molly show) debuted in 1943 with Dumb-Hounded. He appeared in several more Avery cartoons (including Northwest Hounded Police) before being officially given his own series in 1948 with Senor Droopy. The influence of Avery's cartoons was felt across the animation industry; even Hanna and Barbera adapted their Tom and Jerry shorts to match the levels of madcap humor and violence in Avery's films.Maltin, Leonard. Of Mice and Magic, p. 296-297 Avery's team included storymen Rich Hogan and Heck Allen, and animators such as Michael Lah, Ed Love, and Preston Blair, most famous for animating the sexy female singer in Red Hot Riding Hood and its follow-ups. In 1946, Quimby assigned Blair and Lah to direct a new series of Barney Bear cartoons, reversing the decision after three cartoons.Maltin, Leonard. Of Mice and Magic, p. 301-302Barrier, Michael. Hollywood Cartoons, p. 419. === 1950s, CinemaScope === Tex Avery was a perfectionist: he worked extensively on his films' stories and gags, revised his animators' drawings, and was even known to cut frames out of the final Technicolor answer print if he felt a gag had been animated too softly.Barrier, Michael. Hollywood Cartoons, p. 431. The strain of overwork caused Avery to quit MGM in May 1950, after completing Rock-a-Bye Bear (not released until 1952 because of MGM's cartoon backlog). Former Walter Lantz director Dick Lundy was brought in to head Avery's unit. Lundy completed one Droopy cartoon and ten Barney Bear shorts before Avery returned in October 1951 and reassumed his role as director from Lundy, starting with Little Johnny Jet (released in 1953). Avery directed eleven more cartoons for MGM, many of them showing the heavy influence of the style of the newly popular UPA studio in their designs. In March 1953, MGM closed down the cartoon unit, thinking that the growing trend for 3-D films would bring an end to the animated cartoon.Barrier, Michael. Hollywood Cartoons, p. 545. Avery himself did not leave the studio until June, working with co-director Michael Lah on two cartoons, Deputy Droopy and Cellbound, which Lah completed with the Hanna and Barbera staff (working during the most part of 1953 for commercials, as a predecessor of H-B Enterprises) during the closure. Avery went on to join the Walter Lantz staff the following February, while Lah went on to do commercial animation work. Because of the backlog of completed MGM cartoons, the cartoons Avery completed during his second tenure at the studio were not released until after he'd left again; Cellbound was not released until 1955. Meanwhile, after the studio reopened in 1954, budget cuts required Hanna and Barbera to reduce the level of detail in their Tom and Jerry shorts (a precursor of what was to come), and to also begin doing one \\"cheater\\" short per year composed mostly of footage from previously released cartoons.Maltin, Leonard. Of Mice and Magic, p. 304 That year, Hanna and Barbera directed Pet Peeve, the first MGM cartoon in the new widescreen CinemaScope process, which had been was devised as a means to keep audiences attending movie theatres in the wake of the popularity of television. Pet Peeve, released in late 1954, was followed by a sporadic number of CinemaScope Tom and Jerrys, with several other Tom and Jerrys being dual-released in standard format and in CinemaScope. After Pecos Pest (released in 1955), all MGM cartoons were released in CinemaScope. Six previous MGM cartoons, among them Hugh Harman's Peace on Earth, were remade in CinemaScope. Like the original Peace on Earth in 1939, its 1955 remake, Good Will to Men, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons). === Later years (1955‚Äì1958) === Quimby retired in 1955, and Hanna and Barbera became the new heads of the studio. Michael Lah returned to the studio in 1955 to direct an animated sequence for the MGM feature Invitation to the Dance, and stayed on to supervise a new series of CinemaScope Droopy cartoons to accompany the new CinemaScope Tom and Jerry cartoons. Lah's One Droopy Knight was nominated for the 1957 Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons). However, for the most part, both the 1955‚Äì1957 CinemaScope Droopy and Tom and Jerry cartoons had lost their appeal in the eyes of critics, due to weaker stories and simplistic animation, brought on as the result of cuts to their budget.Maltin, Leonard. Of Mice and Magic, p. 305-306. To keep the studio alive, MGM had begun reissuing previously released cartoons since the 1940s, but in late 1956 decided that, since the reissued shorts brought in as much revenue as the new shorts,Barrier, Michael (1999). Hollywood Cartoons. New York: Oxford University Press. Pg. 547‚Äì548. . it could save six hundred thousand dollars a year by ending new production. Most of the reissued cartoons were Tom and Jerry, Droopy, and shorts featuring Tex Avery's showgirl, Red. None of Tex Avery's Screwy Squirrel and George and Junior cartoons were reissued.\\"MGM to Drop Production of Cartoons\\" (April 1, 1959). Daily Variety, Vol. 95, No. 19.Interviews with William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. (2004) How Bill and Joe Met Tom and Jerry. Bonus feature from Tom and Jerry: Spotlight Collection, Vol. 1. Los Angeles: Warner Bros. Entertainment. The studio was shut down on August 1, 1958, and Hanna and Barbera took most of their unit and began producing television cartoons with their company Hanna- Barbera Productions. Hanna-Barbera first approached MGM to distribute their cartoons for television, but were turned down.Maltin, Leonard. Of Mice and Magic, p. 306. Columbia Pictures' Screen Gems picked up Hanna-Barbera's product, and the studio soon became the most successful producers of television animation in the world. MGM would later have Gene Deitch create a series of Tom and Jerry cartoons before contracting Chuck Jones and Les Goldman's Sib Tower 12 studio to create more Tom and Jerry shorts. Sib Tower 12 was absorbed by MGM in 1964, and was renamed MGM Animation/Visual Arts. === Legacy === Many MGM cartoons have become fan favorites throughout the years due to their animation style, plot, humor, cartoon violence (specifically the Tom and Jerry shorts), music, and at times, sexual innuendos (with regards to shorts starring Red). Individual shorts such as To Spring (1936) and The Dot and the Line (1965) have been acclaimed for their artistic designs while others such as Screwball Squirrel (1944) and King-Size Canary (1947) are celebrated for their sheer lunacy. Though not as popular with the general public as the Disney or Warner Bros. cartoons, MGM cartoons are heavily studied and praised by film historians and members of the animation industry. As of 2009, nearly all of the Hanna and Barbera-produced Tom and Jerry shorts are available on DVD under the Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection, a series of three DVD box sets that were released from October 2004 to September 2007 (however, two cartoons are missing due to politically incorrect scenes, and several of the released ones are edited). Warner Home Video would later release the Tom & Jerry shorts as part of the Tom and Jerry Golden Collection series of DVD and Blu-ray boxsets, which started with the first volume being released October 25, 2011, with the shorts being presented uncut, restored, remastered, in chronological order, and for the Blu-ray version, in 1080p high definition. Moreover, a two-disc collection of all of Droopy's cartoons was released in May 2007. Rumors have floated around for years of a box set consisting of Tex Avery's MGM work, but nothing has been released besides the Spotlight and Golden box sets for Tom and Jerry and the Droopy collection in the United States, although all of Tex Avery's cartoons were released on DVD in France through Warner Home Video. However, in 2020, Tex Avery cartoons finally started being released on Blu-ray, when Warner Archive Collection made Tex Avery Screwball Classics Volume 1 this February with 19 of the cartoons. A second volume was announced in March, and is still in the works. == Notable crew members == * Fred Quimby, producer (1937‚Äì1955) * Hugh Harman, director/producer (1938‚Äì1943) * Rudolph Ising, director/producer/storyman/voice actor (1938‚Äì1943) * William Hanna, director/producer/storyman/voice actor/animator (1937‚Äì1958) * Joseph Barbera, director/producer/creative work/layout artist (1937‚Äì1958) * Tex Avery, director/voice actor (1941‚Äì1957) * Dick Lundy, director * Heck Allen, storyman * Richard Bickenbach, animator/layout artist * Claude Smith, character designer * John Didrik Johnsen, background artist (1941‚Äì1955) * Joseph Smith, background artist/layout artist (1938‚Äì1942) * Robert Cannon, animator * Jack Cosgriff, storyman (1938‚Äì1951) * Jerry Brewer, animator/co-director (1938‚Äì1941) * Walt Clinton, animator (1944‚Äì1953) * Rich Hogan, storyman (1941‚Äì1950) * Charles McGirl, storyman (1938‚Äì1940) * John Meandor, layout artist (1938‚Äì1941) * Preston Blair, animator/director (1941‚Äì1948) * Ed Love, animator (1941‚Äì1946) * Kenneth Muse, animator (1941‚Äì1958) * Ray Abrams, animator (1937‚Äì1947) * Ed Barge, animator (1937‚Äì1956) * Ray Patterson, animator (1941‚Äì1953) * Grant Simmons, animator (1948‚Äì1953) * Michael Lah, animator/director (1939‚Äì1958) * Robert Allen, animator/director (1937‚Äì1942) * Scott Bradley, music composer (1937‚Äì1958) * Edward Plumb, music composer (1953) * Bert Lewis, music composer (1937‚Äì1939) * Paul Kerby, music composer (1937‚Äì1938) * Paul Marquardt, orchestrator (1938‚Äì1952) * Emery Hawkins, animator (1937‚Äì1939) * George Gordon, layout man/animator/director (1937‚Äì1943) * Jack Zander, animator (1937‚Äì1942) * Friz Freleng, director (1937‚Äì1939) * Pete Burness, animator (1938‚Äì1947) * Bill Nolan, animator (1937‚Äì1939) * Cecil Surry, animator/character designer (1937‚Äì1941) * Irven Spence, animator/character designer (1938‚Äì1958) * Harvey Eisenberg, layout artist (1937‚Äì1945) * Rudy Zamora, animator (1940‚Äì1943) * Carl Urbano, animator (1939‚Äì1943) * Bill Littlejohn, animator (1937‚Äì1941) * Ed Benedict, layout artist/character designer (1948‚Äì1958) * Bob Kuwahara, background artist (1937‚Äì1939) * Bernard Wolf, character designer/layout artist (1941‚Äì1942) * Tony Pabian, animator (1939) * Lovell Norman, animator (1939) * Fred McAlpin, film editor/sound editor (1937‚Äì1947) * Jim Faris, film editor/sound editor (1947‚Äì1958) * Jack Stevens, photography/camera man (1939‚Äì1958) * Gene Moore, photography (1941‚Äì1942) * Milt Gross, director/writer (1938‚Äì1939) * Mel Blanc, voice actor * Billy Bletcher, voice actor * Daws Butler, voice actor * Pinto Colvig, voice actor * Frank Graham, voice actor * Clarence Nash, voice actor * Bill Thompson, voice actor * Red Coffey, voice actor * Paul Frees, voice actor * Lillian Randolph, voice actress * Sara Berner, voice actress * Lucille Bliss, voice actress * Kent Rogers, voice actor * June Foray, voice actress * Martha Wentworth, voice actress * Dick Nelson, voice actor * Gayne Whitman, voice actor * Wally Maher, voice actor * Georgia Stark, voice actress/whistler * Dave Weber, voice actor * Billy Mitchell, voice actor * Hans Conried, voice actor * Cliff Nazarro, voice actor * Jeanne Dunn, voice actress * Robert Winkler, voice actor * The King's Men, voice actor/choir people * The Rhythmettes, voice actress/choir people * Harry Lang, voice actor * Joseph Forte, voice actor == Productions == ; Series * The Captain and the Kids (1938‚Äì1939; directed by Bill Hanna, Bob Allen and Friz Freleng) * Count Screwloose (1939; directed by Milt Gross) * Barney Bear (1939‚Äì1944, 1947‚Äì1949, 1952‚Äì1954; directed by Rudolf Ising, George Gordon, Preston Blair, Michael Lah and Dick Lundy) * Three Bears (also known as The Bear Family, 1939‚Äì1940; produced and directed by Hugh Harman) * Tom and Jerry (1940‚Äì1958; produced and directed by Hanna and Barbera) * Homer Flea (1940, 1948; directed by Rudolf Ising and Tex Avery) * Droopy (1943‚Äì1958; directed by Tex Avery, Dick Lundy and Michael Lah) * Red Hot Riding Hood & The Wolf (1943‚Äì1949; directed by Tex Avery) * Ol' Doc Donkey (1944; directed by George Gordon) * Screwy Squirrel (1944‚Äì1946; directed by Tex Avery) * George and Junior (1946‚Äì1948; directed by Tex Avery) * Spike (1949‚Äì1952, 1955, 1957; directed by Tex Avery) * Spike and Tyke (1957; produced and directed by Hanna and Barbera) ; Live-action films with animated sequences * Anchors Aweigh (1945; \\"The Worry Song\\" sequence with Gene Kelly and Jerry Mouse with a cameo by Tom Cat) * Holiday in Mexico (1946; Animated title sequence) * Dangerous When Wet (1953; Animated swimming sequence with Esther Williams and Tom & Jerry) * Invitation to the Dance (1956; \\"Sinbad the Sailor\\" sequence) == See also == * The Golden Age of American animation * Turner Entertainment Co. * Warner Bros.

Liquid silicone rubber is a high purity platinum cured silicone with low compression set, great stability and ability to resist extreme temperatures of heat and cold ideally suitable for production of parts, where high quality is a must. Due to the thermosetting nature of the material, liquid silicone injection molding requires special treatment, such as intensive distributive mixing, while maintaining the material at a low temperature before it is pushed into the heated cavity and vulcanized. Chemically, silicone rubber is a family of thermoset elastomers that have a backbone of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms and methyl or vinyl side groups. Silicone rubbers constitute about 30% of the silicone family, making them the largest group of that family. Silicone rubbers maintain their mechanical properties over a wide range of temperatures and the presence of methyl-groups in silicone rubbers makes these materials extremely hydrophobic, making them suitable for electrical surface insulations. Typical applications for liquid silicone rubber are products that require high precision such as seals, sealing membranes, electric connectors, multi-pin connectors, infant products where smooth surfaces are desired, such as bottle nipples, medical applications as well as kitchen goods such as baking pans, spatulas, etc. Often, silicone rubber is overmolded onto other parts made of different plastics. For example, a silicone button face might be overmolded onto a Nylon 6,6 housing. ==Equipment== In order for the liquid injection molding process to fully occur, several mechanical components must be in place. Typically, a molding machine requires a metered pumping device in conjunction with an injection unit‚Äîa dynamic or static mixer is attached. An integrated system can aid in precision and process efficiency. The critical components of a liquid injection molding machine include:Liquid Injection Molding Injectors. An injecting device is responsible for pressurizing the liquid silicone to aid in the injection of the material into the pumping section of the machine. Pressure and injection rate can be adjusted at the operator's discretion. Metering Units. Metering units pump the two primary liquid materials, the catalyst and the base forming silicone, ensuring that the two materials maintain a constant ratio while being simultaneously released. Supply Drums. Supply drums, also called plungers, serve as the primary containers for mixing materials. Both the supply drums and a container of pigment connect to the main pumping system. Mixers. A static or dynamic mixer combines materials after they exit the metering units. Once combined, pressure is used to drive the mixture into a designated mold. Nozzle. To facilitate the deposition of the mixture into the mold, a nozzle is used. Often, the nozzle features an automatic shut-off valve to help prevent leaking and overfilling the mold. Mold Clamp. A mold clamp secures the mold during the injection molding process, and opens the mold upon completion. == Characteristics of LSR == Biocompatibility: Under extensive testing, liquid silicone rubber has demonstrated superior compatibility with human tissue and body fluids. In comparison to other elastomers, LSR is resistant to bacteria growth and will not stain or corrode other materials. LSR is also tasteless and odorless and can be formulated to comply with stringent FDA requirements. The material can be sterilized via a variety of methods, including steam autoclaving, ethylene oxide (ETO), gamma, e-beam and numerous other techniques, meeting all required approvals such as BfR XV, FDA 21 CFR 177.2600, USP Class VI. Durable: LSR parts can withstand extreme temperatures, which makes them an ideal choice for components under the hood of cars and in close proximity to engines. Parts fabricated via liquid silicone rubber injection molding are fire retardant and will not melt. Chemical resistance: Liquid silicone rubber resists water, oxidation and some chemical solutions such as acids and alkali. Temperature resistance: Compared to other elastomers, silicone can withstand a wide range of high/low temperature extremes. Mechanical properties: LSR has good elongation, high tear and tensile strength, excellent flexibility and a hardness range of 5 to 80 Shore A. Electrical properties: LSR has excellent insulating properties, which offer an appealing option for a host of electrical applications. Compared to conventional insulating material, silicone can perform in far higher and lower temperatures. Transparency and pigmentation: LSR possesses a natural transparency, this attribute makes it possible to produce, colorful, custom, molded productshttp://www.simtec-silicone.com/capabilities/liquid-silicone- rubber/ == Injection molding process == Liquid silicone rubbers are supplied in barrels. Because of their low viscosity, these rubbers can be pumped through pipelines and tubes to the vulcanization equipment. The two components are pumped through a static mixer by a metering pump. One of the components contains the catalyst, typically platinum based. A coloring paste as well as other additives can also be added before the material enters the static mixer section. In the static mixer the components are well mixed and are transferred to the cooled metering section of the injection molding machine. The static mixer renders a very homogeneous material that results in products that are not only very consistent throughout the part, but also from part to part. This is in contrast to solid silicone rubber materials that are purchased pre-mixed and partially vulcanized. In contrast, hard silicone rubbers are processed by transfer molding and result in less material consistency and control, leading to higher part variability. Additionally, solid silicone rubber materials are processed at higher temperatures and require longer vulcanization times. Liquid silicone has a very low viscosity index and requires perfect seals of the mould cavity in order to guarantee a burr-free finished product. As injections are carried out at high temperature, steel dilation and natural shrinkage of materials must be considered at the design stage of the LSR injection tooling. From the metering section of the injection molding machine, the compound is pushed through cooled sprue and runner systems into a heated cavity where the vulcanization takes place. The cold runner and general cooling results in no loss of material in the feed lines. The cooling allows production of LSR parts with nearly zero material waste, eliminating trimming operations and yielding significant savings in material cost. Liquid silicone rubbers are supplied in a variety of containers, from tubes to 55 gallon drums. Because of their viscous nature, these liquids are pumped at high pressures (500 - 5000 psi) based on the durometer of the material. The raw materials are shipped in two separate containers (known in the industry as a kit) identified as \\"A\\" and B\\" compounds, with the \\"B\\" side usually containing the catalyst, but may vary based on the brand of silicone used. The two (A and B) compounds must be mixed in a 1 to 1 ratio, usually by way of a static mixer, adding pigment during the mixing process before the curing process begins. Once the two components come together the curing process begins immediately. A chiller supplying cold water to jacketed fittings is typically used to retard the curing process prior to the materials introduction to the mold. A color pigment can be added via a color injector used in conjunction with the material pump (closed loop metering system) before the material enters the static mixer section. In a cold deck scenario, the 1 to 1 mixed compound is pumped through cooled sprue and runner systems into a heated cavity where the vulcanization takes place. The cold runner and general cooling results in minimal loss of material as the injection occurs directly into the part or cavity, saving on overall material costs and using high consistency rubber. The cooling allows production of LSR parts with nearly zero material valve gate waste, however this does not guarantee a \\"flash free\\" finished part. Molds and tooling are varying in design, execution and cost. A good cold runner is expensive as compared to conventional hot runner tooling, and has the potential to provide a high level of performance. ==Advantages of liquid silicone injection molding== *Batches stability (ready-to-use material) *Process repeatability *Direct injection (no waste) *Short cycle time *‚ÄòFlashless‚Äô technology (no burrs) *Automated process *Automated demolding systems ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Elastomers Category:Plastics industry Category:Rubber Category:Silicon chemistry Category:Injection molding ","title":"Injection molding of liquid silicone rubber"},{"id":"7444894","text":"Sanjay Narvekar is an Indian actor from the state of Maharashtra in India.

In 603 career National Hockey League (NHL) games, Kennedy recorded 70 goals and 108 assists for 178 points and 888 penalty minutes. He led the NHL in penalty minutes during the 1968-69 season. Kennedy was born 1935 in Dorchester, New Brunswick and raised in Prince Edward Island. Despite his small frame, he was often the toughest and usually the grittiest player on the ice. As a result, he was a great fan favourite during the earliest days of the Philadelphia Flyers and was sorely missed after his trade in 1969. Forbes spent the following season with the WHL's San Francisco Seals before the team was relocated and renamed for absorption into the NHL, becoming the California Seals. Kennedy's most infamous game was marked by a violent incident in the 1969 Stanley Cup playoffs in Boston, as teammate Pat Quinn delivered a massive hit to Bruins star Bobby Orr, knocking him unconscious. Kennedy responded to the incident by partaking in four fights before punching a linesman and getting ejected from the game.

It is situated in western-central Syria, bordering Idlib and Aleppo Governorates to the south, Raqqa Governorate to the west, Homs Governorate to the north, and Tartus and Latakia Governorate to the east. It is the only Governorate (excluding Damascus) that does not border a foreign country. Measures of its area vary from 8,844 km2 to 8,883 km2,http://www.citypopulation.de/Syria.html with its capital being the city of Hama. ==HistoryArchaeological sites=== * Al Qubays - medieval castle * Apamea - Graeco-Roman city * Bourzey castle - Byzantine castle * Masyaf Castle - medieval castle * Shmemis - Ayyubid castle * Tell Asharneh - possible site of Bronze Age Tunip * Tell Qarqur - ancient settlement ===Modern Syria=== Hama has historically been a centre of opposition to the Assad regime, and it was the centre of an uprising in the late 1970s to the early 1980s that resulted in the 1982 Hama massacre. ===Syrian Civil War=== The city was one of several that saw anti-Assad protests in 2011, the violent suppression of which ultimately led to the outbreak of civil war. Despite this, for the most part the governorate has stayed under the Syrian Government's control, with exceptions of parts of the north-west in the early years of the conflict. The eastern desert regions of the governorate fell under the control of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant by 2016, but by September 2017 the Syrian Army had managed to oust them. ==Geography== The western regions of the governorate are part of the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range (Nusayriyah Mountains), running north to south.Federal Research Division, Library of Congress (2005) \\"Country Profile: Syria\\" page 5 Roughly parallel with the mountains to the east is the Al-Ghab Plain, with the Orontes river flowing through it, Hama city lies on this river.

It was written by Richard Cooper, a writer who had previously worked in both children's and adult television drama. Set in the year 2020, it showed a Britain ruled by the Knights of God, a fascist and anti-Christian religious order that came to power during a brutal civil war twenty years previously. It starred George Winter as Gervase Owen Edwards, the Welsh son of a resistance leader (Gareth Thomas), and John Woodvine as the Prior Mordrin, leader of the eponymous cult. Patrick Troughton played Arthur, the apparent leader of the English resistance, and Julian Fellowes played Mordrin's ambitious and ruthless second-in-command, Brother Hugo. ==Cast== * George Winter as Gervase Edwards * Claire Parker as Julia Clarke * John Woodvine as Prior Mordrin * Julian Fellowes as Brother Hugo * Gareth Thomas as Owen Edwards * Patrick Troughton as Arthur * Shirley Stelfox as Beth Edwards * Nigel Stock as Brother Simon * Barrie Cookson as Brigadier Clarke * Christopher Bowen as Helicopter Pilot * Don Henderson as Colley * Peter Childs as Brother Tyrell * Tenniel Evans as Dafydd * Owen Teale as Dai * John Vine as Brother Williams * Anne Stallybrass as Nell * Roy Boyd as Fenn ==Plot summary== In 2020, Britain is ruled by the Knights of God, a fascist religious order ‚Äì founded by the Prior Mordrin (Woodvine) ‚Äì that came to power during a brutal civil war that began in 2000, during which the Royal Family were supposedly all slaughtered by Hugo (Fellowes) and the civilian government collapsed leaving the Knights free to step into the power vacuum. Mordrin has renamed the south of England \\"Anglia\\", while the north and Scotland ‚Äì which has only recently been brought under control ‚Äì he calls \\"Northumbria.\\" In between is the \\"Wasteland\\", the former industrial regions of Lancashire and southern Yorkshire, where the remaining resistance fighters ‚Äì regarded as terrorists by the Knights ‚Äì are still at large. For the time being Mordrin sees the Wasteland as a convenient buffer to communications and travel between Anglia and Northumbria. Winchester is temporarily serving as the nation's capital, as most of London was destroyed in the war and reconstruction work is hampered by lack of resources. Gervase Owen Edwards (Winter) has grown up in Wales, which has finally succumbed to the rule of the Knights, although the resistance led by his father, Owen (Thomas), remains active. When most civilians in Wales are interned for not showing sufficient enthusiasm for the end of the war and loyalty to the Knights, Gervase is sent to a \\"re-education and training camp,\\" initially accompanied by Owen disguised as a Knight, who tells him that it is important that he lives. During the journey, Gervase meets an English girl, Julia Clarke (Parker). Mordrin becomes obsessed with the idea of destroying the leader of all the resistance to him, and when Gervase is identified as Owen's son, Mordrin threatens to execute Julia unless he denounces his father and joins the Knights of God. After he agrees, Mordrin uses mind-altering drugs to place the post-hypnotic suggestion in Gervase's mind that he should seek out and destroy the Prior's \\"greatest enemy.\\" He is then released, ostensibly to be allowed to find Julia, who has escaped from the camp. Unknown to Gervase, Mordrin needs Julia alive as well, as she is the daughter of Brigadier Clarke, the senior officer in the Coldstream Guards, the last remnant of the British Army, which has been allowed to survive for ceremonial purposes, all other units having been absorbed into the Knights. Meanwhile, Hugo plots to overthrow Mordrin and take power himself, and sends his own agents to intercept and kill Gervase. After Gervase finds Julia, they are ambushed and captured by English resistance fighters led by Colley (Henderson). Gervase is then put on trial for killing one of Colley's men during the ambush, and is found guilty and sentenced to death. Owen threatens to use his own men to free his son, but Arthur ‚Äì who it is revealed is Mordrin's father (reminiscent of King Arthur and Sir Mordred) ‚Äì intercedes and publicly banishes Gervase to the Wasteland, while secretly tasking him with finding the one surviving member of the Royal Family ‚Äì a King to unite the country against the Knights. Mordrin becomes increasingly paranoid, and secretly plans to declare himself King, and even commissions the manufacture of a new crown. Realising the threat Hugo represents, Mordrin has him arrested, but he escapes to London as dissident Knights flock to join him. Gervase and Julia travel to Canterbury, an enclave where the Anglican Church is allowed to survive. Mordrin issues orders for them to be intercepted, but they are \\"captured\\" and taken into the city by Brigadier Clarke and his men, disguised as Knights. It is revealed that Gervase himself is the King, and it is only his love for Julia that prevents him from obeying Mordrin's command by killing himself. Hugo's faction attacks Mordrin's headquarters, and the resistance ‚Äì bolstered by the defecting Coldstream Guards ‚Äì prepares to finish off whoever is left. Owen slips away, having previously vowed to kill Mordrin for what he did to Gervase, but is shot and injured in the battle between the Knights. Hugo corners Mordrin, but is killed himself, and the Prior escapes with his crown into surrounding forest. As he prepared to place the crown on his own head, Mordrin is shot by the mortally injured Owen, who then himself dies. When the battle is over, Arthur takes the crown from Mordrin's dead hand and presents it to Gervase, telling him to rule wisely. ==Novelisation== Richard Cooper's novel based on the same storyline was published around the time of the UK television screenings. The narrative generally follows that of the TV serial, the major exception being that Nell is not shot during the firefight at the cottage. Instead Arthur leads her, Gervase and Julia to the Resistance HQ in the Wasteland. Since Gervase and Julia are not then tracked by Colley and his men, culminating in the death of Fenn in the ambush, Gervase is put on trial solely for having joined the Order and denounced Owen. At the climax of the story, Mordrin is shot by the mortally wounded Owen inside the Knights' chapel at the headquarters, rather than in the surrounding forest. These differences and other details ‚Äì such as that the Knights wear black but otherwise conventional battledress ‚Äì suggest that the book was written before production and that the television script was therefore expanded to fit the desired length. The novel also contains much additional detail about the world of 2020 and the Civil War, such as Ireland as a whole having become an American state, and the source of much of the rebels' supplies, despite an official arms embargo. The civil war was caused by the breakdown of law and order resulting from high unemployment of ten million. The Knights launched a coup, but the Royal Family fled to the North, which rose in revolt against the coup, with the final battle of the war taking place in York. The infant Gervase was smuggled out of the burning city, while all other members of the family were killed. It is mentioned that whilst Hugo uses his position to secure personal luxuries, and especially alcohol, Mordrin is a teetotal vegetarian, with hints that he suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder. It is also clarified that a reaction to the religious trappings of the Order has been a unification of all Christian faiths, with many believing that Mordrin himself is the Antichrist. Gervase is explicitly identified as King Edward IX, a name he finds acceptable for its similarity to his assumed surname of Edwards. ==Production== The TV Times reported Don Henderson's appearance in the serial in its edition of 14‚Äì20 September 1985, accompanied by a photograph of the actor as his character in the programme, stating: \\"Filmed in Hampshire and North Wales, this vision of a bleak future is set in the year 2020 after Britain has been devastated by civil war.\\" There were two directors credited to the serial, Andrew Morgan (episodes 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12 and 13) and Michael Kerrigan (episodes 2, 3, 6, 7, 10 and 11), and the executive producer was Anna Home. Music for the series was composed by Christopher Gunning. ==Broadcast history and home video releases== The serial received its only UK transmission in the Autumn of 1987, two years after it was made, by which time both Troughton and Nigel Stock ‚Äì who plays an old ally of Mordrin's ‚Äì had died. Troughton subsequently worked on other television productions, but they had all been broadcast by the time Knights of God was transmitted (i.e. it was his last transmitted role, not his last filmed or recorded role, which was an episode of Super Gran filmed a week before he died in March 1987). The serial was shown in France by Canal Plus from 7 October to 30 December 1987, under the title Les √âp√©es de feu (\\"The Swords of Fire\\"), and subsequently repeated on La Cinq and FR3. Subtitled 238 minute versions were released over two VHS tapes (118m & 120m) in Denmark and Finland as The Knights of God. A dubbed 199 minute compilation was released on VHS in Germany as 2019 ‚Äì Die Gnadenlosen Knechte Gottes (\\"2019 ‚Äì The Merciless Warriors of God\\"). A dubbed 143 minute version was released in Spain as Los Caballeros De Dios ‚Äì A√±o 2020 (The Knights of God ‚Äì Year 2020). There has been no domestic commercial release of the series on any format in the UK. This is probably due to ongoing complex rights issues after the production company, TVS, lost its ITV franchise in 1992 and subsequently went through a number of take-overs. This problem affects the majority of the TVS programme archive, since much of the original production paperwork and sales documentation has been lost during the intervening years. ==External links== * * Category:1987 British television series debuts Category:1987 British television series endings Category:1980s British children's television series Category:Dystopian television series Category:ITV children's television shows Category:British fantasy television series Category:Post-apocalyptic television series Category:1980s British science fiction television series Category:Television series set in 2020 Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows produced by Television South (TVS) ","title":"Knights of God"},{"id":"7444928","text":"Chain of Rocks locks https://web.archive.org/web/20161226221158/http://www.mvr.usace.army.mil/Portals/48/docs/CC/FactSheets/MISS/UMR%20Locks%20%26%20Dams%20-%202016%20%28MVD%29.pdf Chain of Rocks Lock and Dam, also known as Locks No. 27, is a lock situated at the southern end of Chouteau Island near St. Louis, Missouri on the Upper Mississippi River. Its associated dam is just downstream of the Chain of Rocks Bridge, and the lock is located over southeast on the Chain of Rocks canal. The canal and locks allow river traffic to bypass a portion of the river that is unnavigable in low water due to an anticlinal exposure of bedrock in the river‚Äîa \\"chain of rocks\\". The canal, main lock, and auxiliary lock were built in the late 1940s and early 1950s to allow a by-pass of the Chain of Rocks lying in the main channel of the Mississippi River. This stretch of river in low water seasons was treacherous for commercial tow boats and barges, often requiring them to wait several days for the river to rise. The dam for lock 27 is atypical for the Mississippi, being a weir made of tons of rock laid in the Mississippi to create a small pool elevation upstream from the Chain of Rocks. The drop at Locks 27 can vary from a few feet to over a ten-foot drop depending on the river stage. This low water dam across the Mississippi maintains a minimum pool level upstream of the locks. The Chain of Rocks Lock is operated by the St. Louis District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Locks No. 27 are the southernmost locks on the Mississippi River and they are the only Locks south of the confluence of the Mississippi River and Missouri River. As such, the Locks move more cargo than any other navigation structure on the Mississippi River. ==September 2012 shutdown== An accident caused the lock to be shut down on September 15, 2012. Over four dozen towboats, and over four hundred barges, were stranded when the lock was shut down. A large, rock- filled steel cell‚Äîused to help align barges prior to transiting the lock‚Äîsplit causing the channel to be blocked with rock. The cause of the incident was attributed to exceptionally low water levels. The steel cell has armored sections, to protect it from impacts and abrasion from the heavy barges. But the water had fallen so low that barges were impacting an unarmored portion of the shaft. ==See also== *Chain of Rocks Bridge *New Chain of Rocks Bridge ==ReferencesExternal links== *Chain of Rocks Lock and Dam - U.S. Army Corps of Engineers * The Chain of Rocks Canal and Locks in Madison County, Illinois Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Madison County, Illinois Category:Mississippi River locks Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 1953 Category:Historic American Engineering Record in Illinois Category:Rock-filled dams Category:Dams on the Mississippi River Category:Mississippi Valley Division Category:Locks of Illinois ","title":"Chain of Rocks Lock"},{"id":"7444934","text":"Joel Perovuo (born 11 August 1985 in Helsinki) is a Finnish professional football player who currently plays for the Ykk√∂nen side IF Gnistan in Finland. ==Career== Perovuo began his career with Espoon PS in the youth side, before moving to FC Honka.

Due to the size of the European economy, being the world's largest market and having a huge slice of world trade, this position can be very important in dealing with other world economic powers such as China or the United States.

He has been noted for being pro-European and an Atlanticist.Opening statement for European Parliament Hearing European Commission Concluding WTO talks has been a contentious point after the collapse of the Doha Development Round, with the EU not willing to cut agricultural subsidies without similar action by the United States. Mandelson proposed the creation of European golden shares in July 2007, to protect certain European companies, such as Airbus, from foreign takeovers. The Commission has generally been against golden shares due to their ability to distort the Single Market, the idea being that European golden shares would protect certain companies, but not other European companies, from outside influence.'Golden share' could protect EU companies from takeover: Mandelson EU Business, 23 July 2007. Mandelson stated that he did not intend to seek another term in the Commission after 2009, stepping down in 2008 to become Business Secretary in the Brown ministry. Although his tenure was supported by business representatives in Brussels in light of his advocacy of free trade, his departure was generally welcomed by development NGOs and fair trade campaigners, who viewed his attitude towards developing countries as aggressive, supporting European big business over development goals.Phillips, Leigh (3 October 2008) Trade commissioner Mandelson resigns, EU Observer ===Ashton (2008‚Äì2009)=== Catherine Ashton was nominated by Gordon Brown to replace Mandelson on 3 October, and formally appointed on 6 October.

Ashton became the new High Representative on 1 December 2009, being replaced as Trade Commissioner by Benita Ferrero-Waldner until the second Barroso Commission was in place. ===De Gucht (2010‚Äì2014)=== Karel De Gucht was appointed Commissioner on 9 February 2010, however his statements to the European Parliament ahead of his appointment were met with dismay by trade justice campaigners, who claimed his \\"responses at his three- hour hearing revealed his corporate sympathies and gave little indication that the change of personnel at the European Trade Commission will lead to any change in the direction of European trade policy.\\" De Gucht criticised China for undervaluing the renminbi and the United States for protectionism and incoherence over the Doha round.Willis, Andrew (19 March 2010) De Gucht criticises China and US on trade, EU Observer This further came after EADS pulled out of a US defence contract bid ‚Äì that it had previously won before it was reopened ‚Äì claiming bias against them in the tender process. De Gucht achieved important trade agreements during his commissionship, among others, with South Korea (2011), Colombia and Peru (2013) and Central America, Singapore, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine (2014). The comprehensive trade agreement with Ukraine was a direct cause of the upheavals in Independence Square and the 2013‚Äì14 Ukrainian crisis. He concluded CETA, the first ever agreement with a G7 member, in October 2014. He also concluded landmark economic partnership agreements with ECOWAS, SADC and EAC, covering a total of 75% of the African economy. The EAC trade agreement was signed in Nairobi on 31 October 2014, his last day in office. He left office while several trade negotiations were still ongoing. He oversaw the start of trade negotiations with Japan and Vietnam, resumed talks with Mercosur and began investment agreement negotiations with China. He also prepared and launched the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) in 2013. He enjoyed a strong reputation within the Commission at the end of his mandate, because of his progression of the trade portfolio and his strong views on European policy questions. On the other hand, he had to deal with some criticism in the general public and the media because of the apparently intransparent European negotiation mandate in the ongoing TTIP trade negotiations with the USA, which gave rise to a number of rumours. The concerns were partially relieved after the negotiation mandate was released to the public in October 2014. ===Malmstr√∂m (2014‚Äì2019)=== Cecilia Malmstr√∂m was appointed Commissioner on 1 November 2014.

He said in his confirmation hearings that he intended to sign the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment in 2020, while Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that she wanted a trade agreement with the United Kingdom before the end of 2020. However, in light of his conduct surrounding the Oireachtas Golf Society scandal, Hogan resigned from his role on 26 August 2020. ===Valdis Dombrovskis (since 2020)=== After Phil Hogan's resignation, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen invited the Irish government to present \\"suitable candidates\\" for the vacant Commissioner position. On 27 August 2020, von der Leyen designated Valdis Dombrovskis as interim Commissioner for Trade, who at the time also served as Commissioner for Financial Stability, Financial Services and the Capital Markets Union. Dombrovskis was formally named Commissioner for Trade on 8 September 2020, leading to Ireland losing the trade portfolio on the Commission, and gaining Dombrovskis' former Finance portfolio. ==List== {  - ! !Name !Country !Period !Commission - 1 Jean Rey  1957‚Äì1962 1962‚Äì1967 Hallstein I Hallstein II - 2 Jean-Fran√ßois Deniau  1968‚Äì1970 Rey - 3 Ralf Dahrendorf  1970‚Äì1972 1972‚Äì1973 Malfatti Mansholt - 4 Christopher Soames  1973‚Äì1977 Ortoli - 5 Wilhelm Haferkamp  1977‚Äì1981 1981‚Äì1985 Jenkins Thorn - 6 Willy De Clercq  1985‚Äì1988 Delors I - 7 Frans Andriessen  1989‚Äì1992 Delors II - 8 Leon Brittan  1993‚Äì1995 1995‚Äì1999 Delors III Santer - 9 Pascal Lamy  1999‚Äì2004  rowspan=\\"2\\" Prodi - 10 Danuta H√ºbner  2004 - 11 Peter Mandelson  rowspan=\\"2\\"  2004‚Äì2008  rowspan=\\"3\\" Barroso I - 12 Catherine Ashton 2008‚Äì2009 - 13 Benita Ferrero-Waldner  2009‚Äì2010 - 14 Karel De Gucht  2010-2014 Barroso II - 15 Cecilia Malmstr√∂m  2014-2019 Juncker - 16 Phil Hogan  2019-2020  rowspan=\\"2\\" von der Leyen - 17 Valdis Dombrovskis  2020- } ==See also== * Commerce minister * Directorate-General for Trade ** David O'Sullivan * Foreign relations of the European Union * Economy of the European Union ==External links== * 2010/2014 Commissioner's Official website * Commission External Trade site ==References== Category:Portfolios in the European Commission Category:Foreign relations of the European Union ","title":"European Commissioner for Trade"},{"id":"7444938","text":"Anything Goes is a musical by Cole Porter.

In 1942, the NLNE created individual membership, enabling African-American nurses to participate in the organization.http://nln.org/about In 1952, the NLNE combined with the National Organization for Public Health Nursing and the Association for Collegiate Schools of Nursing as the National League for Nursing, and the United States Department of Education (USDE) recognized the NLN, including it on the initial list of recognized accrediting agencies. This allowed the NLN to assume responsibility for the accreditation of nursing schools in the U.S. thumb At this time, the NLN included African-American nurses in positions, including the board of directors. Willie Mae Jackson Jones (pictured), of the Community Nursing Services of Montclair, New Jersey, served as the first African- American in the organization, as a member of the first NLN board of directors.Fondiller, SH (March 2000). \\"A Retrospective on Civil Rights: Pride and Progress\\".

Among the major awards given are the Mary Adelaide Nutting Award for Outstanding Teaching or Leadership in Nursing Education, the Isabel Hampton Robb Award for Outstanding Leadership in Clinical Practice, and the Lillian Wald Humanitarian Award. == Accrediting Commission == In 1996, the NLN Board of Governors approved establishment of an independent entity within the organization to be known as the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC). In 1997, the NLNAC began operations with sole authority and accountability for carrying out the responsibilities inherent to the accreditation processes. Fifteen Commissioners were appointed: nine nurse educators, three nursing service representatives, and three public members. The Commissioners assumed responsibilities for the management, financial decisions, policy-making, and general administration of the NLNAC.http://www.acenursing.net/resources/ACEN%20Bylaws%20October%202017.pdf The NLNAC was incorporated as a subsidiary of the NLN in 2001, and twelve years later, the name of the NLNAC was changed to the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN), the name under which the subsidiary continues to operate.

It has a long history and is popular in Romania and Bulgaria, where it is known as –ì—ä–º–∑–∞ Gamza. It used to be an important constituent of the Hungarian red cuv√©e Bull's Blood of Eger or Szeksz√°rd, but has long been in decline in Hungarian plantations, to be replaced by K√©kfrankos and Portugieser. It is also grown in most other central European and balkan countries where it is sometimes known as Cadarca or Skadarska.Herbst, Ron and Sharon Wine Lover's Companion pg 273 (Barron's 1995) Kadarka is sometimes assumed to originate from Hungary. Another hypothesis is that is related to the variety Skadarsko, which is supposed to originate from Lake Scutari, which is situated on the border between Albania and Montenegro. In a recent study, it is claimed that one of the parents of Kadarka is Papazkarasƒ± which is grown in Strandja region of Kƒ±rklareli. Cadarca (Kadarka) wine is characterised by full, easily recognizable taste, deep aroma and dark or medium dark colour. Kadarka is often used for cuvees including some of the Egri Bikav√©rs, and also for production of table wines. The best Kadarka is grown in Minis, Romania from 17th century. In Bulgaria, Gamza is mostly cultivated in the northwestern and central northern regions, in the Danubian Plain. Until the recent decades, Gamza was the dominant grape varietal in these Bulgarian regions. The main features of Gamza are a large yet compact cluster of small, almost spherical grapes, dark blue to black in colour. ==Synonyms== Kadarka is also known under the following synonyms:Vitis International Variety Catalogue: Kadarka , accessed on December 16, 2009 (note: site renders Hungarian accented characters incorrectly) Backator-Sz≈ël≈ë, Black Kadarka, Blaue Kadarka, Blaue Ungarische, Bleu de Hongrie, Blue Kadarka, Branicevka, Budai Fekete, Cadarca, Cadarca de Minis, Cadarca Neagra, Cadarka, Cedireska, Cerna Ghija, Cerna Giza, Cerna Meco, Cerna Skadarka, Cetereska, Cherna Gizha, Chernina, Chetereshka, Csoka Sz≈ël≈ë, Domanli, Edle Ungartraube, Edler Schwarzblauer Tokayer, Feket Budai, Fekete Czig√°ny, Fekete Zinka, F≈±szeres Kadarka, Gamza, Gemza, Gimza, Gmza, Gymza, Jenei Feket, Jenei Fekete, Kadar, Kadarka, Kadarka Blaue, Kadarka Ble, Kadarka Bleu, Kadarka Chernaya, Kadarka Crna, Kadarka Fekete, Kadarka F≈±szeres, Kadarka Keck, Kadarka Modra, Kadarka Nemes, Kadarka Nera, Kadarka Noir, Kadarka Rubinrot, Kadarka Schwarz, Kadarka Sinyaya, Kadarkas, Kadarska, Kallmet, Kara Shiralak, K√©k Budai, K√©kkardarka, Kereszetes Level≈±, Keresztes Level≈±, Ksoka Sz≈ël≈ë, Ksoko Sz≈ël≈ë, L√∫dtalp√∫, Lugojana, Meco Cerna, Mekis, Mekish, Modra Kadarka, Mor Kadarka, M√≥rkadarka, Mosler Schwarz, Nazlin Gomza, Nazlun Gamza, Nemes Kadarka, Noble Bleu, Noir de Scutari, Noir de la Moselle, Raisin Noir de Scutari, Raisin Turc, Schwarzer Cadarca.

It is situated in northwestern Syria, bordering Turkey's Hatay province to the north, Aleppo Governorate to the east, Hama Governorate to the south, and Latakia Governorate to the west. Reports of its area vary, depending on the source, from 5,933 km¬≤ to 6,097 km¬≤. The provincial capital is Idlib. In 2011, the governorate was taken over by rebel militias in the context of the Syrian civil war. In 2017, the governorate territory came under the nominal control of the Syrian Salvation Government, with Tahrir al-Sham becoming the dominant militia in the region. The governorate saw intense fighting in the 2019 Northwestern Syria offensive and subsequent 2020 offensive as government forces advanced deep into the rebel territory; by 29 January 2020 rebel control had been reduced to about 57% of the territory of the governorate. On 8 February that same year, only a little more than half of the governorate's territory was reported to still be under rebel control. The remainder of rebel-held territory is dubbed by publications such as Reuters, the BBC and Agence France-Presse as Syria's \\"last rebel stronghold\\". ==HistoryArcheological sites=== * Al-Dana - site of ancient Adennu * Bara - ancient site * Ebla - Bronze Age site * Serjilla - ancient site * Tell Touqan - ancient site ===Modern Syria (1946‚Äì2011)=== Idlib Governorate was separated from the neighboring Aleppo Governorate on 17 November 1957, during the reign of President Shukri al-Quwatli. In the early 1980s, the Idlib Governorate was one of the focal points of the Islamist uprising in Syria. Jisr ash-Shugur was the scene of a mass killing by Syrian security forces in 1980. On 9 March 1980, against a background of anti-government protests across Syria, inhabitants of Jisr ash-Shugur marched on the local Ba'ath Party headquarters and set it on fire. The police were unable to restore order and fled. Some demonstrators seized weapons and ammunition from a nearby army barracks. Later that day, units of the Syrian Army Special Forces were helicoptered in from Aleppo to regain control, which they did after pounding the town with rockets and mortars, destroying homes and shops and killing and wounding dozens of people. At least 200 people were arrested. The following day a military tribunal ordered the execution of more than a hundred of the detainees. In all, about 150‚Äì200 people were said to have been killed. ===Syrian Civil War (2011-present)=== Idlib contested by Syrian Government and rebels (2011‚Äì17) The Idlib Governorate clashes (September 2011 ‚Äì March 2012) were violent incidents involving the newly formed Free Syrian Army (FSA) and government-loyal forces, during which the FSA took control of Saraqib, Binnish, Sarmin, Ariha, Zardana, al-Bara and Taftanaz. This included the 10 March Battle of Idlib (2012), a government victory. This led to the April 2012 Idlib Governorate Operation in which the government unsuccessfully sought to regain control. A consequent cease-fire attempt lasted from 14 April to 2 June 2012. This was followed by the Idlib Governorate clashes (June 2012‚ÄìApril 2013), in which the FSA took or regained control of Salqin, Armanaz, Harem, Sarmin, Darkush, Kafr Nabl, Maarrat al-Nu'man and Taftanaz, while government forces maintained control over Jisr ash-Shugur, Fu'ah, Idlib city, Abu al- Duhur airbase and Khan Shaykhun and recaptured Ariha. The Siege of Wadi Deif military base from October 2012 through April 2013 was also broken. The 2014 Idlib offensive was a series of operations conducted by the rebels against the Syrian Government. The clashes were mostly concentrated around Khan Shaykhun and on the highway towards Maarrat al-Nu'man, and resulted in rebel victory. In the March Battle of Idlib (2015), al-Nusra Front/Army of Conquest-led rebels retook Idlib city from government and Hezbollah forces. In the Battle of Maarrat al-Nu'man (2016) on 13 March 2016, fighters from the Salafist jihadist groups al-Nusra Front and Jund al-Aqsa launched an overnight attack against the FSA's 13th Division headquarters in the town of Maarrat al-Nu'man to crush local protesters and demonstrations. The battle resulted in a victory for the jihadis. The October 2016 Idlib Governorate clashes were violent confrontations between Jund al-Aqsa and the Syrian rebel group the Ahrar al- Sham, the latter supported by several other rebel groups. The Idlib Governorate clashes (January‚ÄìMarch 2017) were military confrontations between Syrian rebel factions led by Ahrar al-Sham and their allies on one side and the Jabhat Fatah al-Sham (later as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham) and their allies on the other. After 7 February, the clashes also included Jund al-Aqsa as a third belligerent, which had re-branded itself as Liwa al-Aqsa and was attacking the other combatants. The battles were fought in the Idlib Governorate and the western countryside of the Aleppo Governorate. The Khan Shaykhun chemical attack took place on 4 April 2017, on the town of Khan Shaykhun, then under the control of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). The town was struck by an airstrike by government forces, which was followed by massive civilian chemical poisoning. The release of a toxic gas, which included sarin, or a similar substance, killed at least 74 people and injured more than 557, according to the Idlib health authority. The attack was the deadliest use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war since the Ghouta chemical attack in 2013. The United Nations, the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, France, and Israel, as well as Human Rights Watch have attributed the attack to the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The Assad government denied using any chemical weapons in the air strike. Predominance of rebels like HTS (2017‚Äì18) The Idlib Governorate clashes (July 2017) were a series of military confrontations between Ahrar al- Sham and Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham. During the clashes, Tahrir al-Sham attempted to capture the Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing. As a result of the clashes, HTS took control of Idlib city, the border crossing, and most of the areas along the Turkish border in the Idlib Province. Clashes resumed in July 2017. In September 2017, the Syrian government and its Russian allies intensified bombing raids against rebel-held towns in Idlib, with multiple casualties.Suleiman Al-Khalidi Russia, Syria intensify bombing of rebel-held Idlib, witnesses say, Reuters, 24 September 2017 Officially, the campaign to capture areas held by ISIL and the rebels began in October. A Turkish military operation in Idlib Governorate took place in October/November 2017. As of August 2018, following the end of the Siege of al-Fu'ah and Kafriya, which had been government-held until July 2018, the governorate is almost entirely under the control of the Syrian rebels (primarily the National Front for Liberation, which has over 50,000 fighters) along with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, with estimated numbers of fighters between 12,000 and 30,000). In September 2018, a demilitarization zone was created on the front between the government and the Turkish-backed opposition, temporarily freezing the conflict. Government on the rebound (2019‚Äì20) There are around 20,000-30,000 fighters in Idlib, General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, explained in July 2019. This was followed by the Deputy Secretary for the Middle East Michael P. Mulroy who explained that \\"Idlib is essentially the largest collection of al-Qaeda affiliates in the world.\\" Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group linked to al-Qaeda, currently has the upper hand among those fight for control of Idlib. The Institute for the Study of War also warns that Idlib is the focus of a strategy by the ISIS to reconstitute and that Idlib may well be the incubator for the next iteration of IS and al-Qaeda. On October 26, 2019, U.S. Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) conducted a raid into the Idlib province of Syria on the border with Turkey that resulted in the death of Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai also known as Ab≈´ Bakr al- Baghdadi. The raid was launched based on a CIA intelligence effort that located the leader of ISIS. This complex operations was conducted during the withdrawal of U.S. forces northeast Syria, adding to the complexity. The Syrian Democratic Forces and the Iraqi military also supported the operation. Turkey stated that they coordinated with the US prior to the mission. A large portion of the governorate was retaken by government forces during the course of the Northwestern Syria offensive (April‚ÄìAugust 2019) (which caused the displacement of nearly a million civilians) and subsequent 2020 offensive (which caused the death of over 1,000 civilians, often in aerial bombardments). As of March 2020 ‚Äì if not much sooner ‚Äì the rebel control over Idlib Governorate is considered a matter of political survival of the Turkish President Erdoƒüan. If Idlib would fall back into the hands of the Syrian government, the next victims for the Syrian government would be the other Turkish-controlled zones in northern Syria which would imply the bankruptcy of Erdogan's war against Turkey's public enemy number one: the PKK. 'For Erdogan, Idlib is kill or cure'. NRC Handelsblad, 4 March 2020. Retrieved 7 March 2020. As the value of Syrian currency has plummeted, the Turkish lira was adopted as legal tender in the governorate on 15 June 2020. ==Geography== Parts of the western-most regions of the governorate form part of the Al-Ghab Plain, through which flows the Orontes river. The region forms a transitional zone between the forested mountains of the western littoral and the Syrian desert to the east. The Jabal Zawiya highland region lies in the south-central areas of the governorate. ===Settlements=== Idlib is the provincial capital; other major settlements include Abu al-Duhur, Al Hamdaniyah, Ariha, Harem, Jisr al- Shughur, Kafrsajna, Khan Shaykhun, Ma'arrat al-Nu'man, Salqin, Saraqib and Taftanaz. ===Districts=== The governorate is divided into five districts (manatiq). The districts are further divided into 26 sub-districts (nawahi): * Idlib District (7 sub-districts) ** Idlib Subdistrict ** Abu al-Duhur Subdistrict ** Binnish Subdistrict ** Saraqib Subdistrict ** Taftanaz Subdistrict ** Maarrat Misrin Subdistrict ** Sarmin Subdistrict * Arihah District (3 sub-districts) ** Ariha Subdistrict ** Ihsim Subdistrict ** Muhambal Subdistrict * Harem District (6 sub-districts) ** Harem Subdistrict ** Al-Dana Subdistrict ** Salqin Subdistrict ** Kafr Takharim Subdistrict ** Qurqania Subdistrict ** Armanaz Subdistrict * Jisr al-Shughur District (4 sub- districts) ** Jisr al-Shughur Subdistrict ** Bidama Subdistrict ** Darkush Subdistrict ** Al-Janudiyah Subdistrict * Ma'arrat al-Numan District (6 sub- districts) ** Ma'arrat al-Nu'man Subdistrict ** Khan Shaykhun Subdistrict ** Sinjar Subdistrict ** Kafr Nabl Subdistrict ** Al-Tamanah Subdistrict ** Hish Subdistrict ==Demographics== As per the 2004 Syrian census the population was 1,258,400. A 2011 UNOCHA estimate put the population at 1,501,000, though this has likely changed since the start of the war. ==Gallery== File:Idlib_governorate_map.pngMap of Idlib governorate File:Ebla - DecArch - 2-124.jpgRuins of Ebla File:Great Mosque of Ma'arrat al-Numan 01.jpgThe Great Mosque of Maarrat al-Numan File:Salquin,minaret.jpgSalqin File:Byzantine temple in Idlib (Ruweiha) Syria.jpgByzantine temple in Idlib File:Sejilla-ruins.jpgRuins of Serjilla ==ReferencesExternal links== * (Film about Syrian Civil War in 2012 in the Idlib area) Category:Governorates of Syria Category:Syria‚ÄìTurkey border ","title":"Idlib Governorate"},{"id":"7445061","text":"David Boys is a top Canadian Scrabble expert.

He was among the first ten members of AA on the East Coast, and was responsible for starting Alcoholics Anonymous in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Later in life, he and Rosa, his wife, moved to San Diego, California and were instrumental in the growth of AA there. James Burwell's Grave His most crucial contribution at the founding of AA came from his atheism‚Äîor as he later termed it, his \\"militant agnosticism.\\" He argued strongly with the early group in New York that it needed to tone down what he called the \\"God bit\\". This resulted in the much more inclusive \\"Higher Power\\" and \\"God as we understand Him\\" concepts that are now so closely associated with Alcoholics Anonymous. This compromise was crucial‚Äîwithout it, AA would probably not have survived at all, much less have reached the number of people it has worldwide today. Jim B.'s contribution to Alcoholics Anonymous is considered second only to that of AA's two co-founders, Bill W. and Dr Bob. He was instrumental in the publication of the all important Saturday Evening Post article by Jack Alexander that first brought nationwide publicity to AA in March 1941. As mentioned by Bill W. in the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions (pp. 143 ‚Äì 145), Jim B. is credited with the adoption of AA's Third Tradition: \\"The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking.\\" In the foreword to the first edition of the book \\"Alcoholics Anonymous\\", historically prior to the standardization of the 12 Traditions, it is stated that \\"the only requirement for membership is an honest desire to stop drinking\\" [emphasis added]. The long form of the Third Tradition now reads: :Our membership ought to include all who suffer from alcoholism. Hence we may refuse none who wish to recover. Nor ought AA membership ever depend on money or conformity. Any two or three alcoholics gathered together for sobriety may call themselves an AA group, provided that, as a group, they have no other affiliation. According to Clarence Snyder (an early AA member from Cleveland): \\"Jimmy remained steadfast, throughout his life and 'preached' his particular [non-God] brand of AA wherever he went.\\"Mitchell K. \\"How It Worked: The Story of Clarence H. Snyder and the Early Days of Alcoholics Anonymous in Cleveland, Ohio.\\" p. 107. 1999.

It is intended to keep the page accessible to users of screen readers, text-only web browsers, or other browsers where support for images or style sheets is either disabled or nonexistent, while allowing the image to differ between styles. Also named Fahrner image replacement for Todd Fahrner, one of the persons originally credited with the idea of image replacement in 2003. == Motivation == The typical method of inserting an image in an HTML document is via the \`<img>\` tag. This method has its drawbacks with regards to accessibility and flexibility, however: * While the \`alt\` attribute is designed for providing a textual representation of the image content, this precludes the use of HTML markup in the textual representation and causes problems with some search robots. * Using the \`<img>\` tag to show text is presentational; many Web designers argue that presentational elements should be separated from HTML content by placing the former in a CSS style sheet. * Images referenced using an \`<img>\` tag cannot be easily changed via CSS, causing problems with alternative stylesheets. Fahrner image replacement was devised to rectify these issues. == Implementations == The original Image Replacement implementation described by Douglas Bowman used a heading, inside of which was a \`<span>\` element containing the text of the heading: ### Sample Headline Through style sheets, the heading was then given a background containing the desired image, and the \`<span>\` hidden by setting its \`display\` CSS property to \`none\`: #firHeader { width: 300px; height: 50px; background: #fff url(firHeader.gif) top left no-repeat; } #firHeader span { display: none; } It was soon discovered, however, that this method caused some screen readers to skip over the heading entirely, as they would not read any text that had a \`display\` property of \`none\`. The later Phark method, developed by Mike Rundle in 2003, instead used the \`text-indent\` property to push the text out of the image's area, addressing this issue: #firHeader { width: 300px; height: 50px; text-indent: -5000px; /* ‚Üê Phark */ } The Phark method had its own problems, however; in visual browsers where CSS was on but images off, nothing would display. Also in 2003, Dave Shea's eponymous Shea method solves both of the issues earlier mentioned, at the cost of an extra \`<span>\`: ### Revised Image Replacement By absolutely positioning an empty \`<span>\` over the text element, the text is effectively hidden. If the image fails to load, the text behind it is still displayed. For this reason, images with transparency cannot be used with the Shea method. #header { width: 329px; height: 25px; position: relative; } #header span { background: url(firHeader.gif) no-repeat; position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Over a dozen different methods has since been developed with varying degree of compatibility and complexity. == References  External links == * Revised Image Replacement ‚Äì an overview of the various FIR techniques by Dave Shea * Ultimate Image Replacement ‚Äì a comprehensive image replacement technique by Jesse Schoberg Category:Web design Category:Cascading Style Sheets ","title":"CSS image replacement"},{"id":"7445076","text":"Extra-pair copulation (EPC) is a promiscuous mating behaviour in monogamous species. Monogamy is the practice of having only one sexual partner at any one time, forming a long-term bond and combining efforts to raise offspring together; mating outside this pairing is extra-pair copulation. Across the animal kingdom, extra-pair copulation is common in monogamous species, and only a very few pair-bonded species are thought to be exclusively sexually monogamous. EPC in the animal kingdom has mostly been studied in birds and mammals. Possible benefits of EPC can be investigated within non-human species, such as birds. In males, a number of theories are proposed to explain extra-pair copulations. One such hypothesis is that males maximise their reproductive success by copulating with as many females as possible outside of a pair bond relationship because their parental investment is lower, meaning they can copulate and leave the female with minimum risk to themselves. Females, on the other hand, have to invest a lot more in their offspring; extra-pair copulations produce a greater cost because they put the resources that their mate can offer at risk by copulating outside the relationship. Despite this, females do seek out extra pair copulations, and, because of the risk, there is more debate about the evolutionary benefits for females. ==In men== Extra-pair copulation in men has been explained as being partly due to parental investment. Research has suggested that copulation poses more of a risk to future investment for women, as they have the potential of becoming pregnant, and consequently require a large parental investment of the gestation period, and then further rearing of the offspring. Contrastingly, men are able to copulate and then abandon their mate as there is no risk of pregnancy for themselves, meaning there is a smaller risk of parental investment in any possible offspring. It has been suggested that, due to having such low parental investment, it is evolutionarily adaptive for men to copulate with as many women as possible, as it will allow them to spread their genes with little risk of future investment. This may therefore lead to more extra-pair copulation in men, as they are able to copulate with other women without the consequences of having to rear new offspring. Various factors can increase the probability of EPC in males. Firstly, males with low levels of fluctuating asymmetry are more likely to have EPCs. This may be due to the fact that signals of low fluctuating asymmetry suggest that the males have \\"good genes\\", making females more likely to copulate with them as it will enhance the genes of their offspring, even if they do not expect long-term commitment from the male. Psychosocial stress early on in life, including behaviours such as physical violence and substance abuse, can predict EPC in later life. This has been explained as being due to Life History Theory, which argues that individuals who are reared in environments, where resources are scarce and life expectancy is low, are more likely to engage in reproductive behaviours earlier in life in order to ensure the proliferation of their genes. Individuals reared in these environments are said to have short life histories. With respect to Life History Theory, these finding have been explained by suggesting that males who experienced psychosocial stress early in life have short life histories, making them more likely to try and reproduce as much as possible by engaging in EPC to avoid gene extinction. However, men may also choose not to have EPCs for multiple reasons. One reason may be that long-term monogamous relationships can help form environments that will aid the successful rearing of offspring, as the male is present to help raise them, leading to an increased probability of the male's genes surviving to the next generation. A second reason that EPCs may be avoided by a male is that it can be costly to them; their EPC may be discovered, leading to the dissolution of the long-term relationship with their partner and, in some cases, lead to their partner assaulting or even killing them. Men may also avoid EPCs to minimize the risk of putting themselves at increased opportunity for STD transmission which can be common in EPCs. The partners in the EPC may be promiscuous as well leading to a higher statistical chance and probability of contracting venereal diseases; this would counter the lower incidence of STD transmission among exclusively monogamous sexually active couples. Spousal homicide is more likely to be committed by males rather than females, which may make the ramifications of EPC more relevant to women. ==In women== From an evolutionary perspective, females have to invest a lot more in their offspring than males due to prolonged pregnancy and child rearing, and a child has a better chance of survival and development with two parents involved in child- rearing. Therefore, extra-pair copulations have a greater cost for women because they put the support and resources that their mate can offer at risk by copulating outside the relationship. There is also the increased risk of sexually transmitted infections which is suggested as a possible evolutionary reason for the transition from polygamous to monogamous relationships in humans. Despite this, females do seek out extra-pair copulation, with some research finding that women's levels of infidelity are equal to that of men's, although this evidence is mixed. Due to the increased risk, there is more confusion about the evolutionary benefits of extra-pair copulation for females. The most common theory is that women mate outside of the monogamous relationship to acquire better genetic material for their offspring. A female in a relationship with a male with 'poorer genetic quality' may try to enhance the fitness of her children and therefore the continuation of her own genes by engaging in extra-pair copulation with better quality males. A second theory is that a woman will engage in extra-pair copulation to seek additional resources for herself or her offspring. This is based on observations from the animal world in which females may copulate outside of their pair-bond relationship with neighbours to gain extra protection, food or nesting materials. Finally, evolutionary psychologists have theorized that extra-pair copulation is an indirect result of selection on males. The alleles in males that promote extra-pair copulation as an evolutionary strategy to increase reproductive success is shared between sexes leading to this behaviour being expressed in females. There are also social factors involved in extra-pair copulation. Both males and females have been found to engage in more sexual behaviour outside of the monogamous relationship when experiencing sexual dissatisfaction in the relationship, although how this links to evolutionary theory is unclear. Surveys have found cultural differences in attitudes towards infidelity, though it is relatively consistent that female attitudes are less favorable toward infidelity than male attitudes. ==In animals== As well as humans, EPC has been found in many other socially monogamous species. When EPC occurs in animals which show sustained female-male social bonding, this can lead to extra-pair paternity (EPP), in which the female reproduces with an extra-pair male, and hence produces EPO (extra-pair offspring). Due to the obvious reproductive success benefits for males, it used to be thought that males exclusively controlled EPCs. However, it is now known that females also seek EPC in some situations. ===In birds=== Pair of zebra finches: Bird Kingdom, Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada Extra-pair copulation is common in birds. For example, zebra finches, although socially monogamous, are not sexually monogamous and hence do engage in extra-pair courtship and attempts at copulation. In a laboratory study, female zebra finches copulated over several days, many times with one male and only once with another male. Results found that significantly more eggs were fertilised by the extra-pair male than expected proportionally from just one copulation verses many copulations with the other male. EPC proportion varies between different species of birds. For example, in eastern bluebirds, studies have shown that around 35% of offspring is due to EPC. Some of the highest levels of EPP are found in the New Zealand hihi/stitchbird (Notiomystis cincta). Where up to 79% of offspring are sired by EPC. EPC can have significant consequences for parental care, as shown in Azure‚Äêwinged Magpie (Cyanopica cyanus). In socially polygynous birds, EPC is only half as common as in socially monogamous birds. Some ethologists consider this finding to be support for the 'female choice' hypothesis of mating systems in birds. ===In mammals=== Pair of white-handed gibbons Additionally, EPC has been shown in monogamous mammals, such as the white-handed gibbon. A study of one group found 88% in-pair copulation and 12% extra-pair copulation. However, there is much variability in rates of EPC in mammals. One study found that this disparity in EPC is better predicted by the differing social structures of different mammals, rather than differing types of pair bonding. For example, EPP was lower in species who live in pairs compared to those who live in solitary or family structures. ===Reasons for evolution=== Some argue that EPC is one way in which sexual selection is operating for genetic benefits which is why the extra-pair males involved in EPC seem to be a non-random subset. There is some evidence for this in birds. For example, in swallows, males with longer tails are involved in EPC more than those with shorter tails. Also female swallows with a shorter-tailed within-pair mates are more likely to conduct EPC than those whose mates have longer tails. A similar pattern has been found for black-capped chickadees, in which all extra-pair males had higher rank than the within-pair males. But some argue that genetic benefits for offspring is not the reason females participate in EPC. A meta-analysis of genetic benefits of EPC in 55 bird species found that extra-pair offspring were not more likely to survive than within-pair offspring. Also, extra-pair males did not show significantly better ‚Äògood-genes‚Äô traits than within-pair males, except for being slightly larger overall. Another potential explanation for the occurrence of EPC in organisms where females solicit EPC is that the alleles controlling such behaviour are intersexually pleiotropic. Under the hypothesis of intersexual antagonistic pleiotropy, the benefit males get from EPC cancels out the negative effects of EPC for females. Thus, the allele that controls EPC in both organisms would persist, even if it would be detrimental to the fitness of females. Similarly, according to the hypothesis of intrasexual antagonistic pleiotropy, the allele that controls EPC in females also controls a behaviour that is under positive selection, such as receptiveness towards within-pair copulation. ==References== Category:Developmental biology Category:Mating Category:Reproduction in animals Category:Sexuality Category:Promiscuity ","title":"Extra-pair copulation"},{"id":"7445085","text":"William Lee Turley (born 15 July 1973) is an English retired football goalkeeper. == Career == At Oxford United he was the first-choice goalkeeper under Jim Smith in the 2006‚Äì07 football season, ahead of Chris Tardif and continued to be during 2007‚Äì2009 under Darren Patterson and then Chris Wilder.

A variant of normal checkers (or draughts), it is played on a standard checkerboard (or chess board), using shot glasses of beer in place of the regular playing pieces. The game is popular with students at universities in the United States. ==Play== The board is set up as for a normal game of checkers, with 12 glasses to a side, each cup half-full of beer. Either the glasses should be visually distinct to distinguish the players' pieces, or a light and a dark beer should be used for each player. The game is played by the standard rule for English draughts. When a piece reaches the king's row, it is designated as a king by filling the glass full. When a piece is jumped by an opposing player, the owner of the piece must drink the beer from the jumped piece. The game is won by a player when the other play cannot move their piece, either because all the remaining pieces are blocked, or because the player has no remaining pieces. The losing player must drink all remaining beers on the board. ==In popular culture== A pivotal scene in Graham Greene's 1958 novel Our Man in Havana sees the protagonist playing a game of draughts using miniature bottles of scotch and bourbon. In the film Love Is News (1937), Tyrone Power plays beer checkers with his fellow newspaper reporters. In the film The Grand Duel (1972), a game of beer checkers using liquor is played between Bighorse (Jess Hahn) and the stationmaster as they were spending the night at Silver Bells.

Set in Renaissance Florence at the court of Lorenzo de' Medici, it was intended as the first part of a planned but unfinished trilogy called Crepusculum. The opera premiered on 6 November 1893 at the Teatro Dal Verme in Milan. ==Background and performance history== I Medici was intended as the first part of a planned but unfinished trilogy called Crepusculum, with the second and third operas to be called Savonarola and I Borgia. The word \\"crepusculum\\" is Latin for \\"twilight\\", signaling the influence of Richard Wagner's tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen (whose fourth installment is called \\"Twilight of the Gods\\" (G√∂tterd√§mmerung)). The remaining two operas were never completed. Leoncavallo sought to create an \\"epic poem\\" for the stage. However, one contemporary review of the premiere stated: > In I Medici we have a historical opera like those that have been made many > times before and will be hence ... [but] we do not have either an epoch or a > set of characters brought truthfully to life; we do not have, in a word, > that human counterpart of Wagner's mythological trilogy at which Leoncavallo > gazed. It premi√®red at the Teatro Dal Verme in Milan on 9 November 1893. It was not successful in its day and has never become part of the standard repertoire. However, it was revived at the Frankfurt Alte Oper in 1993 in a concert version conducted by Marcello Viotti (the opera's first performance in Germany) and was given a fully staged performance in March 2013 at the Theater Erfurt in Erfurt, Germany, conducted by Emmanuel Joel-Hornak.Molke, Thomas (5 April 2013). \\"Die Medici (I Medici)\\".

It rises from the northeast shore of Kostal Lake in the Cariboo Mountains. With an elevation of , Kostal Cone is one of the lowest volcanoes in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field. There has been activity at this site as recently as 7,600 years ago, though more likely less than 1,000 years ago. Kostal Cone is too young for the commonly used potassium-argon dating technique (usable on specimens over 100,000 years old), and no charred organic material for radiocarbon dating has been found. However, the uneroded structure of the cone with the existence of trees on its flanks and summit have it an area for dendrochronology studies, which reveals the growth of tree-ring patterns. Tree-growth data has revealed an age of 400 years for Kostal Cone, making it the youngest volcano in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and one of the youngest volcanoes in Canada. Kostal Cone is made of fragmented and solidified lava called cinder and its summit contains a bowl-shaped crater. Kostal's cinders were ejected by lava fountain eruptions and accumulated around the volcano's vent in the shape of a cone when they fell back around its surroundings. Lava flows from Kostal's 400 BP eruption are basaltic in composition and forms a lava bed. It is an example of volcanic activity that has occurred in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field since the last glacial period; others include the Dragon's Tongue lava flow from Dragon Cone just north of Kostal Cone and the Flourmill Volcanoes north of Mahood Lake. ==See also== * Volcanism of Western Canada * List of volcanoes in Canada ==References== * * * Category:Cinder cones of British Columbia Category:Wells Gray-Clearwater Category:Holocene volcanoes Category:Polygenetic cinder cones ","title":"Kostal Cone"},{"id":"7445294","text":"George Fisk Comfort (September 20, 1833 ‚Äì May 5, 1910) was a 19th-century American scholar and art exponent, and founder of both the Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY, and Everson Museum of Art, Syracuse, NY. == Biography == Comfort was born in Berkshire, New York. He graduated from Wesleyan University in Middletown, CT with an A.B. degree (in classics) in 1857 and an A.M. degree in 1860. After completing his studies at Wesleyan, he traveled to Europe to study art history and archaeology where he stayed until 1865. In Berlin, Comfort was influenced by meetings and studies with the philosopher Friedrich Kaulbach, Carl Richard Lepsius (curator of Egyptology at the Berlin Museum), Gem√§ldegalerie director Gustav Waagen, Leopold von Ranke, among others. From 1865 to 1868, he served as professor of languages at Allegheny College, Meadville, Pennsylvania.Dictionary of Art Historians Comfort helped found the American Philological Association, whose first meeting he organized in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1869.

The romantic comedy stars Constance Talmadge and Ronald Colman. ==Plot== American millionaire Samuel C. Adams brings his daughter Dorothy to England to see a specialist about her heart trouble. So that she will not be hounded by the press and fortune hunters, Dorothy makes herself up to look extremely plain. Impoverished Lord Paul Menford spies her without the hideous disguise and falls in love with her immediately. When he is mistaken for his uncle, the heart specialist Adams seeks, he goes along in order to meet her. Meanwhile, his agent sells the Menford family estate to Adams. When Menford finally admits the ruse, Dorothy sends him away. Later that night, he gets drunk and goes home, only he has forgotten that he no longer lives at the Menford estate. He crawls into his old room, only to find Dorothy there. Frightened, she makes him leave and barricades the door for good measure. However, he just reenters the room through another door. When she faints, he picks her up and carries her into another bedroom. The butler, his old former servant, sees him do this. The next morning, Dorothy comes down for breakfast, and is annoyed to find the butler has put out two table settings. When one of Paul's friends shows up unexpectedly and finds them dining together, Paul introduces Dorothy as his wife to avoid a scandal. The butler overhears, and soon the joyous \\"news\\" has spread to the village. Dorothy's father arrives. When the villagers gather outside to loudly wish the newlyweds well, Mr. Adams believes that his daughter has married as well. Paul eventually tries to clear things up, but Adams thinks he is just joking. Adams is finally convinced when he finds Paul preparing to sleep in a different bedroom from his \\"wife\\". Having gotten over her initial dislike for Paul, she agrees to his suggestion that they get married for real. However, when she overhears Joe Diamond congratulating Paul for landing a wealthy heiress and demanding 10% as promised, the wedding is off. Paul sadly leaves. Dorothy's father sees that she is heartbroken without Paul. Paul returns, having received a letter from her, apologizing for her behaviour and asking him to come see her before he leaves for Paris. She is puzzled (but secretly overjoyed), as she did not write it. While Paul packs some of his belongings, she goes to consult her father, who confesses that he is responsible.

The music is influenced by the French music halls where Leoncavallo had spent his early years as a composer.

Cox Sports New England served as the local programming outlet for Cox Communications, the cable service provider in Rhode Island and parts of Connecticut. Cox Sports New England focused primarily on local high school and college sports, including Providence College Friars and UConn Huskies of the Big East Conference and University of Rhode Island Rams of the Atlantic 10 Conference. Other college teams covered included: Central Connecticut State University, Rhode Island College, Bryant University and more. Professional teams included: Pawtucket Red Sox, New England Revolution and Boston Cannons. Cox Sports provided an extensive look at high school sports, broadcasting over 40 high school games annually. In addition, Cox Sports featured Varsity Life, a show co-produced with WJAR focusing on highlights and issues of relevance to high school student athletes. Cox Sports also hosted the RI Sports Awards every June in Providence. Cox Sports had also teamed up with Eric Scott Latek of Phantazma Pictures to produce two original documentary series. In 2007, they began producing an original documentary series, 3 degrees, which garnered two Telly Awards for Best Series and Best Cinematography. The show focuses on the struggle of 4 different local martial artists as they balance life inside and outside the ring. It returned for a second season of six episodes in 2009. The 2009 winter season also premiered Xpos√©, an eight show series featuring the people on the frontlines, goal lines and side lines in local traditional and adventure sports throughout Rhode Island. Featured episodes include Darren Rizzi's (now an assistant coach for the Miami Dolphins) first and only season as head coach of the University of Rhode Island Football Team, The Women of Providence Roller Derby, the New England Collegiate Baseball League's Newport Gulls, the Rhode Island National Guard and \\"Driven,\\" which highlights the attempt of two local businessmen to create a custom car business in Rhode Island that focuses on fundraising for charity and community involvement. Also broadcast on Cox Sports were ESPN Plus college football and basketball games, CFL football, coaches' shows for the many teams, outdoors programming, ESPNEWS, and other select events and shows. Cox Sports also simulcasted the 10 p.m. newscast from Boston CW affiliate WLVI, which is produced by WHDH. This was the only access via cable to a Boston newscast available in Rhode Island; its addition to the network in January 2001 (when the network was programmed as a general cable access channel branded simply as Cox 3) came after Cox dropped WBZ-TV from its systems. Even though the network relaunched as a regional sports network on September 30, 2004 and the production of the newscast shifted from WLVI itself to WHDH in December 2006, the arrangement had continued. NESN+ was shown on Cox Sports when the Boston Red Sox and Boston Bruins were playing simultaneously. On May 2, 2012, Cox and WJAR launched Ocean State Networks (OSN). As a result, Cox Sports was taken off the air and all of its programming was moved to the new network (excluding ESPNEWS and WLVI's 10 p.m. newscast). OSN also airs WJAR newscasts throughout the day and night. The network replaces NewsChannel 5 (formerly the Rhode Island News Channel), operated by Cox and WLNE November 30, 1998 until February 1, 2012.

He received his primary education in a Bengali medium school, even though primary education the English medium had become available by then in Bankura. As a child he liked poetry and soon he was drawn to patriotism through the poems of Rangalal Bandyopadhyay. He passed Student-Scholarship Examination in 1875 from Bankura Banga Vidyalaya. He passed the Entrance from Bankura Zilla School in 1883 arrived at Kolkata to pursue higher education. In 1885, he passed the F.A. from the St. Xavier's College and took admission in the City College. In 1888, he appeared in the B.A. from City College and stood first class first in the University of Calcutta. He won the Ripon Scholarship of rupees fifty per month. Pleased at the success of Chatterjee, professor Heramba Chandra Maitra offered him the post of assistant editor at the Indian Messenger, the mouthpiece of Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, of which he was the editor at that time. This offer opened up Chatterjee's future career in journalism. In 1890, he completed his Masters in English from University of Calcutta. == Career == Towards Home Rule, written in 1917. In 1893, he joined the City College as a lecturer. Along with Jagadish Chandra Bose, he founded the children's magazine Mukul with Sivanath Sastri as the editor.

He gave a talk on 10 March 1934 to a group of young students summarising his view of the role of newspapering: He spoke of the gathering of news, ideas and facts drawn from by thoughtful people from the world over; it needs to be put down in a language that a person in the street can understand; the faithful coverage of public opinion must be matched by the boldness to challenge it should that opinion not be pointing in the right direction. A good knowledge of politics and governance is required as well as the history of the rise and fall of nations, economics, social sciences and even insurance.

He was one of the signers of the Ordinance of Secession on December 20, 1860, which effectively launched the Confederacy. ==Early life and career== Born in Charleston, South Carolina, on August 22, 1807, Gist was the illegitimate child of merchant Francis Fincher Gist and Mary Boyden. He moved with his father to Union County, South Carolina, in 1811 and came under the guardianship of his uncle, Nathaniel Gist, upon the death of his father in 1819. His uncle legally obtained the Gist last name for William Henry and sent him to Columbia to study law at South Carolina College (which became the University of South Carolina after the Civil War ended). Gist was expelled in 1827 because he had led a boycott of Steward's Hall due to the living restrictions imposed by the trustees of the college. Nevertheless, Gist passed the bar examination and returned to Union to build Rose Hill Plantation on the land that his father had left him. Bricks were made on-site to construct the -story Georgian style mansion, and it took four years to complete. He successfully managed the plantation, and it steadily grew in size and importance. Twice, Gist ran into difficulties with the law for alleged involvement in duels, but both times escaped without punishment. ==Political career== Gist won election to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1840 as a strong supporter of states' rights to chattel slavery,http://civilwartalk.com/threads/who-was-william-henry-gist.71773/ and he was elected to the South Carolina Senate in 1844. He served three terms in the SC state Senate before being elected by the General Assembly as the 68th Governor of South Carolina. Gist's home at Rose Hill Plantation served as the Governor's Mansion during his term as governor. Gist was bitterly opposed to the presidential candidacy of Abraham Lincoln in November 1860, and Gist had discussed with governors of other Southern states what course of action they would take if Lincoln were elected. Gist believed that because the United States of America was created through a compact among sovereign states, the states retained their sovereign powers and could leave the Union if the federal government failed to protect their rights and privileges. Receiving assurances from the governors of Florida and Mississippi that they would follow South Carolina's lead, Gist called for a secession convention to be held in Columbia on December 17, 1860. The convention was moved to Charleston because of a smallpox outbreak in Columbia, and Gist was one of the signers of the Ordinance of Secession on December 20, 1860. Florida and Mississippi signed their own Ordinance of Secession in January 1861. The creation of the South Carolina Executive Council in 1861 provided Gist an opportunity to participate in the state's wartime activities of the Civil War. He was in charge of the Department of Treasury and Finance and later the Department of Construction and Manufactures, but the dissolution of the South Carolina Executive Council in September 1862 ended his involvement in the politics of the state. Gist had two sons who fought for the Confederacy the youngest being David Christopher Gist. His eldest son William was killed by a Union sharpshooter outside of Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1863. Gist was the cousin of States Rights Gist, a Confederate brigadier general who died leading a charge at the Battle of Franklin, Tennessee, in 1864. ==Later life== After the Civil War ended in 1865, Gist took an oath of allegiance in Greenville, South Carolina, and received a pardon from President Andrew Johnson. He returned to Rose Hill Plantation, which had survived the Civil War and Sherman's March to the Sea because the Broad River was in flood stages and the Union troops could not get through. Gist remained at Rose Hill and rented out the land to sharecroppers. He developed appendicitis and died on September 30, 1874. Gist is buried in the family plot near the mansion. ==See also== * Confederate States of America, secessionists and conventions ==ReferencesExternal links== *SCIway Biography of William Henry Gist *NGA Biography of William Henry Gist *Rose Hill Plantation State Historic Site *Sandlapper Online feature of Rose Hill Plantation and William Henry Gist Category:1807 births Category:1874 deaths Category:University of South Carolina alumni Category:South Carolina lawyers Category:Members of the South Carolina House of Representatives Category:South Carolina state senators Category:Governors of South Carolina Category:University of South Carolina trustees Category:People of South Carolina in the American Civil War Category:Recipients of American presidential pardons Category:South Carolina Democrats Category:Democratic Party state governors of the United States Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"William Henry Gist"},{"id":"7445325","text":"State Highway 136 (SH 136) is a Texas state highway that runs from the Texas‚ÄìOklahoma border south of Guymon, Oklahoma to Amarillo.

The town was located at the confluence of Dicks Creek and the Tallulah River in Rabun County, Georgia and was established in the first half of the 19th century as a result of the Georgia Gold Rush. The first discovery of gold in Rabun County was just north of Burton, at the confluence of Moccasin Creek and the Tallulah River. The town was named after Jeremiah Burton, who owned the post office and general store there. The Burton Post Office was established in 1875 and discontinued in 1916.Helbock, Richard W. (2007) United States Post Offices, Volume VIII - The Southeast, p. 48 Scappoose, Oregon: La Posta Publications Burton was located along the road from Clayton, Georgia to the Nacoochee Valley and became more than just a gold rush town ‚Äì it served the corundum mines of Tate City. Eventually, the logging industry built a railway to the town so that lumber from the mountains could be transported to the mill in Helen, Georgia. By the early 20th century, the town of Burton had a population of approximately 200, making it the second largest town in Rabun County. In 1917, the Georgia Railway and Electric Company (predecessor of the Georgia Power Company) purchased the town of Burton and the surrounding homesteads. The dam for Lake Burton was closed on December 22, 1919 and before long the town was submerged. ==ReferencesSources== *Burton, Georgia on Roadside Georgia *Burton profile on Ghosttowns.com *1883 Map of Rabun County *1915 Map of Rabun County Category:Ghost towns in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Geography of Rabun County, Georgia ","title":"Burton, Georgia"},{"id":"7445357","text":"Draped Bust dollar obverse \\"Draped Bust\\" was the name given to a design of United States coins. It appeared on much of the regular-issue copper and silver United States coinage, 1796‚Äì1807. It was designed by engraver Robert Scot. ==Basic design== In 1796, Congress responded to the almost universal dissatisfaction of the first coins (Flowing Hair dollar) and decreed a new design. As was the custom of the time, all denominations bore the same design or, in this case, the same obverse. By Congressional decree, certain features were required: the eagle, the word Liberty, stars, and United States of America. It was not considered necessary to include the value of the coin since it could be discerned from its size based on the precious metal content. Thus, the half dime was the smallest silver coin (containing 1/20 of the amount of silver in a dollar) and each denomination was larger up to the silver dollar. ===Obverse=== All coins (copper and silver) bore the same obverse. Robert Scot, Chief Engraver of the U.S. Mint, 1793‚Äì1823, transformed a portrait of a society lady by Gilbert Stuart into a rather buxom Ms. Liberty. Some accounts identify the woman as Philadelphia socialite Ann Willing Bingham. She remained essentially unchanged for several years with the exception of an extra curl added to her flowing locks in 1798. ===Reverse=== 1803 Draped Bust dollar reverse There are three basic reverse designs. The first, for copper coins, features the value of the coin (half cent or one cent) surrounded by a wreath or vine. The words \\"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\\" encircle the wreath. In 1795-1797, a scrawny, naturalistic bald eagle was depicted on the reverse side of all silver coins. This design is known as Draped Bust, Small Eagle and usually commands a high price due to the extremely low mintage at the time. In 1798, the small eagle was replaced by the Heraldic eagle. This design is known as Draped Bust, Heraldic Eagle. The famous 1804 silver dollar has this design as well the reverse of the Kennedy half dollar in 1964. Three denominations also bore the appropriate fraction: half cent (1/200), large cent (1/100) and half dollar (1/2). ===Rim=== The half dollar rim (edge) bore the words FIFTY CENTS OR HALF A DOLLAR. ==ModificationsStars=== Initially, the decision was made to add a star to the obverse of a coin for each new state that joined the union. By 1796, the nation had grown to 15 states with the additions of Vermont and Kentucky. Each denomination was minted with 15 stars. That year Tennessee was admitted and a 16th star was added. Director of the Mint Elias Boudinot realized that the situation could not continue indefinitely and decreed that all coins would contain the original 13 stars. The half dime of 1797 exemplifies the confusion at the time; it was minted with 13, 15 and 16 stars. ===National motto=== The Heraldic Eagle introduced a national motto ‚Äì E pluribus unum (Out of many, one). It appears on a flowing ribbon and is held in the talon of the eagle. In 1956, the national motto was replaced and is now In God We Trust, a phrase that first appeared on American coins in 1864 at the height of the American Civil War. ===Variations=== Due to primitive working conditions, materials and poorly constructed dies numerous errors and variations appeared. These include letters and numbers shaped differently, cracks appearing on the surface of the coins, misstrikes and overstrikes (Liberty half dime, 1796), the size of stars or numbers varied from one die to the next (1807 half dollar) and dates overpunched previous dates (1800 large cent, printed over 1798 and 1799). Incongruities persisted: In 1796 the half dollar appeared with 15 stars, then 16 stars. Mysteriously it portrayed 15 stars in 1797 despite the presence of 16 states. Many of these faults are quite rare and demand a high premium due to their scarcity. ==Famous coins== The Greatest 100 U.S. Coins selected the 1804 silver dollar as the number one coin. It bears a heraldic eagle on the reverse and the price is prohibitive. Eight were minted in 1834 (Class I) and the rest minted about 1858 (Class II)The Storied 1804 Silver Dollar The 1802 half dime ranks number 61. Only 3,000 were minted and the vast majority of these were either lost, melted or wore out. Most 1802 half dimes that do exist are in extremely poor condition. The 1797 half dollar (ranked 68) has the \\"small eagle\\" design. This design is rare due to the very low mintage and the inferior equipment and procedures. Fewer than 3,000 were minted. Its companion, the even rarer 1796 half dollar (ranked 72) had a mintage of only 934. The pair constitute the sole mintage of the half dollar \\"small eagle\\" design. One is required for a complete type set, thus there are always more buyers than sellers. The 1796 quarter (seen above) ranked 71. It is also the \\"small eagle\\" design and is the only representative in this denomination of that design. Since it too is required for a complete type set, its price continues to rise. Only 6,000 quarters were minted that year. By comparison, the Tennessee State Quarter, one of five struck in 2002, had a mintage of 650,000,000 (the mintage of all state quarters in 2002 was over 3 billion). ==Coins used on== * Half cent * Large cent * Half dime * Dime * Quarter * Half dollar * Dollar coin *Thomas Jefferson's Liberty (First Spouse program), obverse bust only, new reverse design. ==References== *Garnet, Jeff and Guth, Ron The Greatest 100 U.S. Coins Atlanta, Ga: Harris, L.L.C., 2003 *Yeoman, R.S.

The Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) is a United States Air Force (USAF) airborne communications relay and gateway system carried by the unmanned EQ-4B and the manned Bombardier E-11A aircraft. BACN enables real- time information flow across the battlespace between similar and dissimilar tactical data link and voice systems through relay, bridging, and data translation in line-of-sight and beyond-line-of-sight situations. Its ability to translate between dissimilar communications systems allows them to interoperate without modification. Because of its flexible deployment options and ability to operate at high altitudes, BACN can enable air and surface forces to overcome communications difficulties caused by mountains, other rough terrain, or distance. BACN provides critical information to all operational echelons and increases situational awareness by correlating tactical and operational air and ground pictures. For example, an Army unit on the ground currently sees a different picture than an aircrew, but with BACN, both can see the same picture. On 22 February 2010, the Air Force and Northrop Grumman BACN Team received the 2010 Network Centric Warfare Award from the Institute for Defense and Government Advancement. On 27 January 2020, USAF E-11A, serial 11-9358,http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_serials/2011.html crashed in Afghanistan at about 1:00 PM (LT); 8:30 AM (UTC). ==Purpose== Individual tactical data links (e.g., Link 16, EPLRS, etc...) are just a part of the larger tactical data link network, encompassing tactical data links, common data links, and weapon data links. Most military platforms or units are equipped with a tactical data link capability tailored to their individual missions. Those tactical data link capabilities are not necessarily interoperable with one another, preventing the digital exchange of information between military units. BACN acts as a universal translator, or gateway, that makes the tactical data links work with one another. BACN also serves as an airborne repeater, connecting tactical data link equipped military units that are not within line of sight of one another. An operational example would be: * A B-1 flying an orbit on one side of a mountain range needs to communicate with a Tactical Air Control Party located in a valley on the opposite side of the mountain. * The mountain prevents line-of-sight voice and data communication * A BACN flying an orbit over the mountain range would act as an airborne communications repeater and TDL gateway connecting the two units * The TACP can digitally send targeting information to the B-1 cockpit and communicate via the BACN aircraft * The two units are able to communicate in near-real time without requiring limited SATCOM resources or other bandwidth constrained beyond-line-of-sight methods ==Background== Bombardier Global Express aircraft configured as a BACN aircraft, August 2007 Interoperability between airborne networking waveforms has been a persistent challenge. There have been multiple systems developed to address the challenge to include Air Defense Systems Integrator (ADSI), Gateway Manager, and Joint Range Extension (JRE) product lines. However, those product lines were separately funded/maintained and had interoperability concerns of their own. The solution was an \\"Objective Gateway\\" which would serve as a Universal Translator to make data from one network interoperable with another. In 2005, the USAF's AFC2ISRC and ESC created BACN as an Objective Gateway technology demonstrator to provide voice and data interoperability between aircraft in a single battle area. The four key principles were * radio agnostic - it would support a variety of communication protocols * platform agnostic - BACN could be mounted on a variety of aircraft * un-tethered - unlike previous repeaters, which were hung from floating aerostats, BACN has the ability to move within the battlespace * Knowledge-based intelligence - the ability to sense waveform characteristics of sender and receiver and automatically route traffic. The BACN first flight was November 2005 at MCAS Miramar in San Diego, CA. BACN was successfully demonstrated in Joint Expeditionary Force eXperiment (JEFX) 2006 and JEFX 2008 and selected for field deployment. ==Joint support== Getting critical air support to troops in contact with the enemy supports our troops on the ground, as well as in the air. This project is not just limited to combat operations. It has provided the World Food convoy commander with ‚Äúcomms-on-the-move.‚Äù This capability allows convoys to stay in continuous contact with air support and around command channels in the complex, adverse terrain, mitigating exposure to attacks- they no longer needed to halt to establish communications. ==Platforms== NASA WB-57 as BACN Aircraft, typically above 55,000 feet The BACN prototype was originally developed and tested in 2005-2008 on the NASA WB-57 high altitude test aircraft during Joint Expeditionary Force Experiments and other experimentation venues. The last two flying WB-57s were used for this mission in Afghanistan. BACN was also deployed for testing on a Bombardier Global Express BD-700 and originally designated as the RC-700A under a reconnaissance classification. The aircraft was later re-designated as the E-11A under the special electronics installation category. The BD-700 was selected due to its high service ceiling (up to 51,000 ft) and long flight duration (up to 12 hours). These flight characteristics are critical in providing unified datalink and voice networks in the mountainous terrain encountered in the current theater of operations. Additional E-11As have been deployed to increase availability and flexibility. These have been used in operations in Afghanistan. BACN payloads have also been developed, installed, and operated on special variant EQ-4B Global Hawk aircraft to provide unmanned long endurance high altitude communications coverage. The combination of BACN payloads on E-11A and EQ-4 aircraft gives planners and operators flexibility to adapt to mission needs and increase coverage in the battlespace to near 24/7 operations.\\"Two More Global Hawks to Receive BACN Coms Gateways.\\" Defense Update, 1 February 2012. The effectiveness of BACN has increased the demand for more EQ-4B Global Hawk aircraft to be created and installed with BACN to be utilized in the field. The BACN system continues to be a high in-demand system that the Air Force will more than likely continue to use for many years to come. Northrop Grumman has also developed BACN pods that can be temporarily mounted to other various aircraft. ==BACN as a concept== BACN has been a controversial program within the DoD. This is caused by a number of issues including the personality clashes between the service people who conceived the project back in late 2004 and the traditional acquisition bureaucracy. This was particularly true between requirements developers at the former Air Force Command and Control Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance Center at Langley AFB, Virginia and their acquisition partners at the Electronic Systems Center (ESC) at Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts, part of Air Force Materiel Command. BACN divides military planners and acquisition bureaucrats on two main fronts. First, how will an \\"Airborne Network\\" evolve beyond the existing tactical data links on today's platforms. Second, the BACN effort presupposes that the capability will initially be \\"outsourced\\" to commercial companies that will provide an \\"airborne network\\" as a service to the DOD for the foreseeable future. ==The evolution of airborne networking== With few exceptions, today's military aircraft, in any service, are not networked. While many platforms have implemented tactical data links that allow some measure of collaboration between flights of aircraft, very little information is passed between command and control elements and attack aircraft at the tactical edge. Since 2001, the DoD has made significant progress in \\"linking\\" platforms together. This would include some degree of cross service interoperability but within common groupings like ground attack aircraft and fighters. USAF F-15s and US Navy F/A-18s can link together using Link 16 and share some limited information between flights like target data, fuel and weapons status. On the other hand, USAF bombers like the B-52 and B-1 are not equipped with data links and cannot interoperate with either F-15s and F/A-18s. Furthermore, half the USAF A-10 and F-16 fighter force in the Air National Guard (ANG) are equipped with Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL). gear that cannot interoperate with Link 16 unless there is a \\"gateway\\" which has radios for both data links, and a computer system that can interconnect them and translate the data. While the deployment of data links to fighter aircraft has aided flights of aircraft to coordinate their attacks locally, these systems are constrained by line of sight and cannot reach command and control centers that are often hundreds, if not thousands, of miles distant from where the fighting is taking place. While the USAF has taken the lead to field \\"gateways\\" that can handle both connecting dissimilar links and relaying data over satellite back and forth to connect command and control to the tactical edge, the platform that carries the gateway is more often than not dedicated to another mission (like air refueling) that consumes limited resources and sub-optimizes some other critical theater activity. There are unfortunately bigger problems with linking aircraft together with data links. While ground attack aircraft are increasingly linked, they cannot interoperate with attack helicopters or ground forces with any service. In an age where there is zero tolerance for even a single \\"friendly fire\\" death, attack aircraft from either the Navy, Marine Corps or the Air Force use the same sensors to prevent fratricide that were used in World War I‚Äîtheir eyeballs. Late in the last decade of the Twentieth Century, defense planners began to think beyond simply \\"linking\\" forces to \\"networking\\" them and fundamentally changing the information model at the tactical edge from one that required a priori knowledge of required information to employ forces, or \\"push\\" model, to one in which the information required was globally available and could be \\"pulled\\" as required by warfighters engaged in combat. This new model came to be known as \\"Network Centric Warfare (NCW).\\" The drive towards NCW began in earnest with the arrival of the Bush Administration. Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld drove a transformation of the DoD so that it would be capable of meeting the needs of the 21st century. This DoD-sanctioned technology push became the perfect incubator for pursuing a networked force. On Rumsfeld's recommendation, President Bush appointed a number of industry leaders to key positions within the DoD that brought with them their experience in the technology revolution that exploded in the 1990s. The concept is expected to evolve into the Joint Aerial Layer Network. Finally, with the increasing likelihood of a contested electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) in an era of great power competition, the idea of a \\"BACN-mesh\\" was proposed by Professor Jahara Matisek (and former E-11 BACN pilot) at the US Air Force Academy, as a way of pursuing new multi-domain war-fighting options against near-peers. Specifically, Prof. Matisek suggests that smart node pods (i.e. a BACN-light payloads affixed to aircraft with hardpoints), could provided layered BACN ‚Äúbridging‚Äù connections and TDL services to war-fighters in an EMS-contested battlespace, without deploying a specific BACN aircraft. For example, in the Pacific ‚Äì where infrastructure is limited ‚Äì a ‚ÄúBACN-mesh‚Äù concept could be employed to create real-time battlespace pictures, proving useful when a near- peer adversary attempts localized jamming across the EMS. A \\"BACN-mesh\\" concept, if properly employed with numerous smart node equipped aircraft, would \\"create a complex, impregnable, and mutually reinforcing communication network with multiple relay nodes.\\" == See also == * Global Information Grid * Network-centric warfare * Airborne radio relay ==ReferencesExternal links== * AF C2 Integration Center Category:Military electronics Category:Networking standards Category:Northrop Grumman ","title":"Battlefield Airborne Communications Node"},{"id":"7445424","text":"Churchill Square (officially \\"Sir Winston Churchill Square\\") is the main downtown square in Edmonton, Alberta, which plays host to a large majority of festivals and events including: the Edmonton International Street Performers Festival,Edmonton Street Performers Festival.

Magazine of the Theodor Kramer- Society Vienna, 34, 4, December 2017 p. 74 (Letter to the editor by Aurelia Young, daughter of Nemon; with picture of the statue) ==History== Historically, Edmonton's main square was Market Square, located just to the south of Churchill Square, on the site of the present Milner Library. The City Market was housed in Market Square from its beginning in 1900, originally with the market happening outdoors. Successive plans were considered to develop the square into a civic centre, beginning in 1912. A building was built far away on 107 Avenue for the market to be moved indoors in November 1914, but was never used for this purpose and was boycotted by vendors and customers. The market returned to its original location and the city agreed to help construct a shelter. Beginning in 1915 the market was moved indoors, and by 1920 only overflow stalls were outside. From 1916, when the shelter was built, to 1965, when it moved off the site, the market flourished as the hub of Edmonton life. The City Market was finally shifted east to 97 Street, and the area was redeveloped according to a plan to create a \\"civic centre\\" in the area by constructing the new art gallery and library to accompany the new city hall which had been built in 1957. In 1969, Lillian Shirt drew national media attention for protesting housing discrimination by erecting a tipi on the square. During the protest, which lasted 12 days, was joined by several others who set up tents and an additional tipi. Churchill Square has undergone several face-lifts, the most recent, expensive, and most controversial, being completed in 2004, in time for Edmonton's Centennial Celebrations. These renovations saw the removal of a large amount of green space, as well as the building of several new structures in the square including an amphitheatre, a waterfall, as well as several structures for retail space (currently occupied by the Three Bananas Cafe and Tix on the Square). ==Transportation== Churchill Square is well served by the Edmonton Transit System, being located above Churchill LRT Station as well as being at the confluence of several major (1 WEM-Capilano, 2 Lessard-Clareview, 3 Jasper Place-Cromdale, 7 University- Jasper Place, 8 Mill Woods-Abbotsfield, 16 Castle Downs-Government Centre,) and minor bus routes. St. Albert Transit and Strathcona County Transit also run three bus routes each (StAT routes 201, 202 & 211 & SCT routes 401, 402, & 413) past Churchill Square. Currently under construction, the new Valley Line LRT will expand Churchill Station with an above-ground platform on the south end of the square on 102 Avenue. ==Surrounding buildings== Although Churchill Square is not the name of any street in Edmonton, and all the streets in the area are named, the square is used as the address for buildings facing it, they are numbered clockwise starting in the north. {  - !

Crowley became part of Wood's inner circle of friends that she called \\"the nucleus\\", whose main requirement was that they pass a \\"kindness\\" test. The Boys in the Band was adapted into a film in 1970 directed by William Friedkin. Crowley's 2002 sequel to The Boys in the Band was entitled The Men from the Boys.Roca 2002, p. 1. In 2018 Boys in the Band was restaged on Broadway in a 50th anniversary revival featuring Matt Bomer, Jim Parsons, Zachary Quinto, and Andrew Rannells. Crowley also wrote and produced Remote Asylum and the autobiographical A Breeze from the Gulf. In 1979 and 1980, Crowley served first as the executive script editor and then producer of the ABC series Hart to Hart, starring Wood's husband Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers. His other credits include the teleplays for There Must Be a Pony (1986), Bluegrass (1988), People Like Us (1990), and a reunion special of Hart to Hart in 1996. Crowley appeared in at least four documentaries: The Celluloid Closet (1995), about the depiction of homosexuality in cinema; Dominick Dunne: After the Party (2007), a biography of Crowley's friend and producer Dominick Dunne; Making the Boys (2011), a documentary about the making of The Boys in the Band; and The Boys in the Band: Something Personal (2020), a documentary about the Netflix remake of the movie. Crowley was openly gay. Crowley died in Manhattan, New York on March 7, 2020.

Steps connecting Reverchon Park to the Katy Trail in Dallas, Texas. Reverchon Park is a public park in the Oak Lawn area of Dallas, Texas. It was named for Julien Reverchon. The park lies along Turtle Creek, a tributary of the Trinity River. Its main entrance is at Maple Avenue and Turtle Creek Boulevard. ==History== Built in 1915, Reverchon Park is one of the oldest parks in the city. First named Turtle Creek Park, it was renamed Reverchon Park after Julien Reverchon (1837‚Äì1905), a botanist and a member of the La Reunion Utopian Community. In the 80s and 90s, the park was notoriously crime-ridden, but a rejuvenation project beginning in 1998 helped turn Reverchon into one of Dallas' most successful parks, according to The Dallas Morning News. The Southern Methodist University baseball team played at the ballpark from 1977‚Äì1980, before the baseball program disbanded after the 1980 season. ==Features== Reverchon Park is in area, and offers around 40 leisure and recreational program for citizens, including health screenings, tutoring, athletic leagues, yoga, volleyball, and after-school programs. The park also is home to baseball fields, basketball courts, and tennis courts. A playground in the park, accessible to children of all abilities, was designed by the Texas Scottish Rite Hospital, the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, and the City of Dallas. A section of the Katy Trail, a recreational rail trail, runs adjacent to the park. It connects to parks of the Trinity River Project. ===Ballpark=== Reverchon Park includes a 3,500-capacity 1920s-era ballpark used for high-school and amateur baseball teams. It was the home field for Southern Methodist University baseball from 1977 to 1980. In July 2018, plans were announced for a new multi-purpose stadium in the park to host a Dallas franchise in the independent Southwest League of Professional Baseball, as well as local high school playoff games, amateur baseball leagues, and the Mexican Baseball League. With the Southwest League never playing a game, in January 2020 the Dallas City Council approved a renovation proposal from a group led by Dallas Mavericks general manager Donnie Nelson who is also an owner of the Texas AirHogs of the independent American Association. The $10 million plan included new seating, artificial turf, locker rooms, dugouts, and concessions and restrooms facilities, all to accommodate professional and amateur baseball, soccer, lacrosse, concerts and rugby. In October 2020, the plan was reported to be dead when the group led by Nelson failed to submit documentation before a Sept. 30 deadline. == References Sources=== * \\"Southwest Conference's Greatest Hits,\\" Neal Farmer, c.1996 == External links == *Friends of Reverchon Park * Category:Parks in Dallas Category:Baseball venues in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex Category:SMU Mustangs baseball venues Category:1915 establishments in Texas ","title":"Reverchon Park"},{"id":"7445462","text":"Chevanceaux is a commune in the Charente-Maritime department in the Nouvelle- Aquitaine region in southwestern France. ==PopulationSee also== *Communes of the Charente-Maritime department ==References== Category:Communes of Charente-Maritime Category:Charente-Maritime communes articles needing translation from French Wikipedia ","title":"Chevanceaux"},{"id":"7445478","text":"Lieutenant-General Eric A. \\"Rick\\" Findley, CMM, MSC, CD (born 1950) is a retired officer in the Royal Canadian Air Force and was the Deputy Commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) from July 2003 through August 2007. ==Early life and career== Findley was born in Ottawa, Ontario, in 1950.

Its western entrance is close to the Ensenada locality, northeast of the provincial capital of Puerto Montt, and from Puerto Varas along Ruta CH-225. This national park covers about and is almost entirely in the Andes mountain chain. The adjacent national parks Vicente P√©rez Rosales and Puyehue National Park in Chile, and Nahuel Huapi National Park and Lan√≠n National Park in Argentina, provide a continuous protected area of close to . The park protects the body of Todos los Santos Lake and a large part of its catchment. The outlet of the lake at the Petrohu√© locality gives rise to the Petrohu√© River. A short distance downstream, still within the limits of the Park, the Petrohu√© river flows through the Petrohue Waterfalls. The Park also contains the eastern slope of Volcan Osorno, the southern slope of the Puntiagudo and the western slopes of the Tronador, with a maximum altitude of . These mountains with year round snow give a strong imprint to the landscape. A summary of geographical and limnological data for lake Todos los Santos is found in the database of the International Lake Environment Committee. ==Climate== Direcci√≥n Meteorol√≥gica de Chile (Chilean Meteorological Service) published a climate summary for the 10th Region . Average annual precipitation in the Petrohu√© area (lat 41¬∞08'S), at an elevation of , is around . Precipitation on the Lake surface is around while on the western slope of the mountains it may reach per year. The predominant air flow is from west to east and the mass of air, when lifted over the mountains, releases precipitation. Eastern slopes tend to receive less rainfall. The most rainy months are June, July and August, while the least rain is recorded in January, February and March. Average annual temperature at the inhabited levels, altitude, is around . Above altitude, snow persists for most of the year. During the warm summer months, average daily maximum temperature may be around . Vegetation growth extends over approximately 6 months of the year. ==Geology== The geological substratum of the Park area is generally Granodiorite, an igneous rock. Except for recent sediments and volcanic cinders, no old sedimentary rocks appears anywhere in the Park. Through the igneous rock substratum, a number of stratovolcanoes have emerged. The Tronador and related structures are the result of volcanic activity dating back to the early Pleistocene. At the western entrance to the Park, the symmetrical cone of the Osorno volcano forms a towering landmark over the Todos los Santos and Llanquihue lakes. The peak of the Osorno is at . The Osorno built up on top of an older stratovolcano, La Picada, which has a 6-km- wide caldera now mostly buried. The Puntiagudo is a stratovolcano with a sharp peak whose summit is at . From the Puntiagudo to the northeast for extends a fissure that has given birth to 40-odd basaltic scoria cones. The Cayutue La Vigueria volcanic field consists of some 20 maars and cinder cones, of which Volcan Cayutue is the principal. The activity of Volcan Cayutue filled the Cayutue depression and separated the Todos los santos lake from the Ralun estuary. Lava flows from these volcanoes is basaltic and andesitic. Their activity is generally explosive and lava flows are highly viscous. A summary of scientific information on the volcanoes of the Park (Osorno, Puntiagudo- Cord√≥n Cenizos and La Viguer√≠a) is available from the Global Volcanism Program of the Smithsonian Institution. A second major factor that shaped the landscape was the action of glaciers during the ice age. Huge glaciers descended from the Tronador and found the way through the Todos los Santos valley far into the Central Valley of Chile. The glaciers removed practically all sediments that had deposited earlier. At exposed capes, visitors can observe the scratches left by stones carried by the glacier on the denuded surface of the granite opposing the flow of the glacier. Volcanoes were active during the retreating phase of the ice age. Some geologists postulate that Lake Todos los Santos and Llanquihue were just one lake in which the Osorno volcano built up until the two water bodies were separated. From then on, lake Todos los Santos had its surface level lifted as successive lava flows from the Osorno blocked the outlet of the lake. At the Petrohue waterfalls, one sees the river flow over such a constraining andesite lava flow. The steep left bank of the river is granodiorite. These volcanoes expel large quantities of loose cinder that in depositing give the rounded conic shape. These cinders are easily washed away by rain and surface water flow, so that the Puntiagudo, an elder brother of the Osorno, is denuded to the hard core of lava frozen inside the volcanic chimney. In a recent geological if not historical event, rocks of volcanic origin raised the Ensenada depression between the Osorno and the Calbuco volcanoes, thus forcing the Llanquihue lake to open a new outlet to the sea on its western shore. ==Flora== Petrohu√© River The vegetation of the Park corresponds to the Valdivian temperate rain forests in its mountain variant. The composition of the forest changes with altitude and substratum. Generally the most common and visible tree is coihue, Nothofagus dombeyi, in changing association with other species that include muermo, also known as ulmo, Eucryphia cordifolia and tineo, te√±iu, Weinmannia trichosperma. At relatively warm locations, that is, close to the lake, there are thickets of tique, Aextoxicon punctatum. In particularly humid locations, canelo, fu√±e, Drimys winteri is common; this species is also known as Winter's bark. At altitudes above 900 meters, coihue is replaced by deciduous leaf Nothofagus species. Trees and bushes of the Myrtaceae, the family of myrtus, are with nine species the most diversified taxon in the Park. They are generally associated with the presence of plenty water. Easily visible on beaches because of its bright orange bark is Temu, arrayan, Luma apiculata, Chilean myrtle. Luma colorada, reloncavi, Amomyrtus luma is well known in Chile because of its dense, heavy wood that was used to manufacture police truncheons. The lineage of the Proteaceae, with relatives in Australia and New Zealand, has several representatives in the Park. Notro, fosforillo, Embothrium coccineum, Chilean firebush, has plentiful red tubular flowers and is frequent almost everywhere at the fringe of the forest. Avellano, gevuin, Gevuina avellana, Chilean hazel, carries edible nuts called avellanas. This tree does not shed its nuts until the following year, so on its branches co- exist yellow-white aromatic flowers, unripe red nuts and ripe black nuts. Among herbaceous vegetation, the giant pangue, nalca, Chilean rhubarb Gunnera tinctoria is ubiquitous. It grows up to 2 meters tall and has very large leaves. The stem is edible and the indigenous name \\"nalca\\" actually applies to this part of the plant. The root was used in the past for dyeing wool; it yields a brown color. Pangue is among the first plants to colonize land freed by landslide. In this forest ecosystem, a number of plant species rely on birds, notably hummingbirds, for pollination. The flowers of these species are generally bright red and yellow and have no perfume. The flowers awaiting the visit of birds tend to be tubular and hanging. A number of exotic plants have become feral in the Park. The most visible impact is given by retamo, Spanish Broom Spartium junceum, syn. Genista juncea, also known as Weaver's Broom, a perennial, leguminous shrub native to the Mediterranean region, toxic to animals. It thrives on the sand fields around the Osorno, along the road from Ensenada to Petrohue and in Petrohue. Retamo is very pretty when in flower but it does not belong. ==Fauna== Petrohu√© Waterfalls and the Osorno volcano About 30 species of mammals live in the Park. These species are shy and difficult to observe. This Park and the geographically contiguous Puyehue, Nahuel Huapi and Lanin parks provide habitat to the puma, Puma concolor. The local sub-species is relatively small, usually not more than 30 or 40 kg, and preys on pudu Pudu puda, a tiny deer of solitary and reclusive forest habitat. Hui√±a, kodkod, Leopardus guigna, often mistaken for a stocky, short wild cat, is actually a member of the family of the leopards, a tiny ocelot. Of the group of the Canidae, the dogs, the Park is inhabited by chilla, Pseudalopex griseus, an animal that looks like a small fox but is not actually a fox. Introduced European red deer, Cervus elaphus, is having negative impact on natural renewal of the forest. Also damaging to the ecosystem balance is the introduced wild boar, Sus scrofa. Three native species of carnivores of the Mustelidae group inhabit the Park. One is Molina's hog-nosed skunk, Conepatus chinga; the second is lesser grison, Galictis cuja; the third is southern river otter, Lontra provocax, an endangered species. An introduced mustelid: American mink, Mustela vison, has wrought havoc in the Parks ecosystems. The impact of mink has been devastating for bird species nesting on the ground and on floating reeds. A diversity of animals of the rodent group live in the park. The larger ones are coipo, coypu, Myocastor coypus, a webbed-feet animal that inhabits reedy lake and river banks; and Wolffsohn's viscacha, Lagidium wolffsohni, of the family Chinchillidae, whose preferred habitat is above the timber line. Among the smaller rodents, scientists have shown particular interest for Chilean climbing mouse, Irenomys tarsalis, and for the long- clawed mole mouse, Geoxus valdivianus. The park is home to two species of marsupial mammals. Monito del monte, Dromiciops gliroides, has a semi-arboreal habit. It has been discussed why this South American marsupial appears to more closely related to the marsupials of Australasia than to those of the Americas. The other marsupial in the Park is the long-nosed shrew opossum, Ryncholestes raphanurus, first described for science in 1923. Around 80 species of birds, among full-time residents, seasonal migrants and visitors, are seen in the Park. Among the full-time residents are the Rhinocriptidae, of which the easiest to hear, and sometimes to see, is chucao tapaculo, Scelorchilus rubecula. Another rhinocryptid bird: black-throated huet-huet, Pteroptochos tarnii, is a speciality for birders in this park. Torrent duck, Merganetta armata, is sometimes seen at Petrohue waterfalls. One species of hummingbirds, the firecrown Sephanoides sephaniodes, is common and easily visible in the Park. The native fish fauna in Todos los Santos lake has been upset with the introduction of several species of trout and salmon. Sports fishing of these introduced species is a major activity in the Park. Among arthropods, the large antlered scarabeid beetle Chiasognathus granti, and the shiny coloured cerambicid beetle Cheloderus childreni have to be mentioned. ==Park services== Management of this and other national parks in Chile is entrusted to Corporacion Nacional Forestal, CONAF. CONAF has outposts in Ensenada, Petrohue and Peulla and control posts at the Petrohue waterfalls and at various access points to the Osorno volcano. A camping place administered by CONAF exists in Petrohue. CONAF has habilitated a number of hiking trails, of which the more significant ones are: Sendero Paso Desolacion on the eastern slope of the Osorno, with 12 km length and reaching up to 1 100 meters altitude, and Sendero Laguna Margarita in Peulla, 8 km long. Lake Todos los Santos is a segment of a trail over the Andes known to have been used for centuries. In the late 19th century, a regular freight and tourist service between Puerto Montt was established, together with hotels and lodges. There are modern good quality hotels at the lake access points Petrohue and Peulla. Lodges catering for the needs of fisherpersons exist at the lake in Cayutue and close to Petrohue waterfalls and river. In Petrohue, private enterprise offers motor boats for rent. ==References== * ChileBosque * Enciclopedia de la Flora Chilena * All on lake Todos los Santos, Chile Category:National parks of Chile Category:Protected areas of Los Lagos Region Category:Valdivian temperate rainforest Category:Protected areas established in 1926 Category:1920s establishments in Chile Category:1926 establishments in South America Category:1926 in Chilean law ","title":"Vicente P√©rez Rosales National Park"},{"id":"7445532","text":"Alvin Owen \\"Red\\" Tyler (December 5, 1925 ‚Äì April 3, 1998) was an American R&B; and neo-bop jazz saxophonist, composer and arranger, regarded as \\"one of the most important figures in New Orleans R&B;\\". ==Biography== Born and raised in New Orleans, Tyler was known as \\"Red\\" because of his light tanned skin.

Tyler then moved to California where he recorded with Sam Cooke, Larry Williams and others, before returning to New Orleans in the mid-1960s. He co- owned Parlo records AKA Olrap Publishing, Inc., which found success in 1967 with Aaron Neville's \\"Tell It Like It Is\\". From the mid-1960s Tyler worked as a liquor salesman. He also began leading his own jazz band, the Gentlemen Of Jazz, in clubs and hotel residencies in New Orleans, and played with other jazz musicians including Ellis Marsalis.Rose Witmer, Biography, AllMusic.com. Retrieved 28 October 2015 While the baritone saxophone had been his primary instrument during his years as a studio musician, his jazz playing gradually came to rely much more on tenor saxophone. In the mid-1980s he recorded two jazz albums, Graciously and Heritage, with vocals by Johnny Adams and Germaine Bazzle, for Rounder Records. In 1994, he recorded the album The Ultimate Session with Toussaint, Earl Palmer, Mac Rebennack, and other New Orleans musicians. Tyler died at age 72 in New Orleans.

Born in 1917 in Nong Het, Laos, he became the first Hmong politician to achieve national prominence. During his long career, which began under French colonial rule and extended to the communist takeover in 1975, he supported the Royal Lao Government and American involvement in the Secret War. ==Under French rule== Touby Lyfoung was the son of Ly Xia Foung, a very well respected man among the Hmong community of Laos, and the grandson-in-law of Lo Bliayao, one of the first Hmong to gain leadership position in the Laotian government. Coming from a rich and well known family, Touby was able to attend schools in the lowlands of Laos and sent to study in Vietnam as well. Touby studied at the French Lyc√©e, School of Law, and the Administration in Vientiane. The French were impressed by his education, for he was the only Hmong to have attained such an education in the French colonial empire. Being one of the few Hmong people educated in the French colonial school system,Touby Lyfoung was elected as head (tasseng) of the Nong Het sub-district in Xiangkhoang Province in 1939. The next year, as the only Hmong member of the Opium Purchasing Board, he oversaw the institution of a new tax that was payable in opium for those farmers who were too poor to pay in cash.McCoy, A.W. (1972) \\"The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia\\", Harper & Row (Chapter 3: 'The Meo of Laos') At the time, many Hmong, like other ethnic minorities in the region, cultivated poppies and sold the extracted opium as a cash crop. The French colonial authorities relied on taxes from the opium trade to fund infrastructure projects and draw revenue from the colonies. Cut-off from their most abundant supply of opium in Afghanistan (due to conflicts associated with World War II), the French looked with favor upon Lyfoung for helping to improve the output of Laos. When the Japanese occupied Laos in March 1945, Lyfoung was arrested for his associations with the French. He escaped and moved to the mountains where he helped to lead guerrilla attacks against the occupiers with a Hmong militia that included the young future general, Vang Pao.Lee, Gary Yia. \\"Ethnic Minorities and National Building in Laos: The Hmong in the Lao State.\\" Peninsule , No.11/12, 1985/86, pp.215-232 ==After World War II== Following, World War II, the French colonialists appointed Lyfoung district head (chaomuong), giving Hmong people direct representation at the national level for the first time.Gunn, Geoffrey C. Political struggles in Laos, 1930-1954: Vietnamese communist power and the struggle for national independence. Bangkok: Editions Duang Kamol, 1988: 227. The move helped to widen the growing gap between Lyfoung and Faydang Lobliayao, another Hmong leader who had been promised the earlier tasseng position by the French. Lobliayao went on to join the communist/nationalist struggle against the French rulers (with the Pathet lao) and later the Royal Lao Government. Lyfoung remained loyal to the RLG and led forces against the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese between 1946 and 1954, helping to force them out of Xiangkhoang province.Adams, Nina S. \\"Patrons, clients, and revolutionaries: the Lao search for independence, 1945-1954.\\" In Laos: war and revolution. New York, Harper & Row, 1970: 100-20. In the 1950s, Lyfoung's role was critical in shaping the newly independent Kingdom of Laos as a nation acknowledging the diversity of its 63 ethnic minorities while being united as one country. Touby Lyfoung was the first Hmong and ethnic minority person to be honored by the King of Laos, when he was appointed Minister to the King, with the title of Phagna Touby Lyfoung. In the 60's and 70's, Lyfoung continued his lifelong fight for the Hmong people's dignity and freedom in Laos, he took sides with the Royal Lao Government to fight the Communists in Laos and led a Hmong anti- Communist movement against the Pathet Lao ==Death of Touby Lyfoung== After the takeover of Laos by the communist Pathet Lao in 1975, Lyfoung decided not to the flee the country despite the threat of retribution for supporting the RLG. Under the new government, he was appointed deputy Minister of Telecommunications but later arrested and sent to Prison Camp Number One in Houaphan Province on the Vietnamese border. This was the same camp where members of the royal family, including King Savang Vatthana, were kept prior to their death. According to another inmate of the camp, Colonel Khamphan Thammakhanty, Touby was kept shackled during the final months of his life but other inmates could hear him singing songs that mocked the new government. It is reported that Touby Lyfoung was shot by a guard in April 1979 and buried locally.Kremmer, C.

The club is the former home of Argentine-Paraguayan footballer Lucas Barrios.http://www.ole.com.ar/futbol- ascenso/primera-b/Barrios-Barrac_0_269373133.html ==HistoryFoundation and early years=== Felipe C√°mpora, a truck driver, founded Club Atl√©tico Barracas Central on 5 April 1904 under the name \\"Barracas Central del Sud\\". C√°mpora carried out the project and became the first president of the entity. During the early years of the club's foundation, the founders would each contribute 75¬¢ cents until 1906 where a monthly fee was paid. In 1911 Barracas joined the Argentine Football Association under the name \\"Villa Soldati\\" and began participating in the Argentine football intermediate division. In 1913 the club officially changed its name to \\"Barracas Central\\". The team crowned champion of the second division, Divisi√≥n Intermedia, therefore gaining promotion to the Primera Divisi√≥n, where Barracas would play until 1931 when football became professional in Argentina, with a new dissident league, Liga Argentina de Football organizing its own championships. Barracas Central remained in the official league (that remained amateur) until 1934 when both leagues merged, being all the amateur teams relegated to the second division.1934 Argentina amateur league at RSSSF Barracas Central in 1944. That team won the Primera C title. In 1939 Barracas Central was near to promote to the first division, playing a hexagonal tournament which was eventually won by Banfield as Barracas and All Boys both finished second. The team could not escape relegation in 1941 where it would stay in the third division (Primera C) until 1944 when Barracas Central went through the season undefeated, with 14 wins and 2 draws, winning the competition. By 1948 the club managed to get back up to the second division, but the AFA undertook a restructuring of the competitions, introducing the Division's A, B, C and D. The clubs that would take part in the C and D division's were generally the ones which did not meet stadium requirements, as chosen by the Argentine Football Federation, Barracas would play in the C and D leagues along with All Boys, Defensores de Belgrano and Estudiantes de Buenos Aires among others. From 1950 to 1970, Barracas played in the Division C when their best performance came in 1957 when they ranked in third position among 18 teams. ===1980‚Äì2000=== Despite a steady performance in 1970 season, Barracas Central finished in the relegation zone, alongside Flandria, in 1980. The two played off in a single fixture, where Flandria avoided relegation by defeating Barracas 2‚Äì1. This sent Barracas down to the Primera D Metropolitana for the 1981 season. The 1981 Primera D was split into two zones, where which Barracas Central and Defensa y Justicia had both finished in first place in their respective zones, promoting both teams to the Primera C. After almost gaining promoted to the Primera B Metropolitana, Barracas fell short in 1985 and were relegated to the Primera D. The following years saw poor results from the squad until the 1988‚Äì89 season, which was the first year that the Argentine Football Association saw that seasons would begin in the middle of each year, Barracas managed to earn themselves a play-off position where which they would go on to beat F√©nix, Villa San Carlos and Sacachispas to get it back to the Primera C. The success was short lived as Barracas would finish in second last spot among 19 teams in the 1989‚Äì90 season, relegating the team back to the Primera D. Over two years, Barracas Central strengthen and once more climbed the ladder to Primera C. Those were the years when the club fought against relegation, rather than for promotion. ===2000‚Äì10=== Having won the Primera C Metropolitana's Apertura title of 2003, Barracas Central could have achieved direct success of winning the Clausura of 2004. However, Barracas finished in fourth place which saw them face Argentino de Rosario in a two-legged play-off to determine who would gain promotion to the Primera B Metropolitana. The two sides met at Newell's Old Boys' Estadio Marcelo Bielsa for the first-leg which saw Barracas Central lose by 2‚Äì1. The second leg was played at Hurac√°n's Estadio Tom√°s Adolfo Duc√≥ which saw Barracas win by 2‚Äì1. The game was then decided by a penalty shootout which saw the side from Rosario win at 5‚Äì4 to gain promotion inplace of Barracas. A few years later, in the 2006‚Äì2007 season, Barracas reached the same position again where which they would again face Argentino de Rosario in a play-off. Like 2004, Argentino de Rosario went out as winners, breaking the hearts of Los Baraque√±os. The 2007‚Äì2008 season saw Barracas lead the table at one point but faded to finish fifth. Once more Barracas would feature in the play-offs, this time against Club El Porvenir which earnt them a tie with San Telmo, who had finished near the bottom of the Primera B Metropolitana. San Telmo won 3‚Äì2 at home and then lost 1‚Äì0 away, which meant their result was sufficient to satisfy their position in the Primera B Metropolitana while Barracas would once again stay in the Primera C. ===Promotion to Primera B=== The Primera C Metropolitana 2009‚Äì2011 season kicked off highly for Barracas, winning 21 games throughout the season and losing just 7. Barracas eventually finished in first position on the table, tied with Excursionistas with 73 points, Barracas were immediately promoted to the Primera B Metropolitana for the 2010‚Äì2011 where rivals Barracas Bol√≠var would finish in last place, seeing them relegated to the Primera D Metropolitana season. The defying moment which saw Barracas officially gain promotion to the Argentine third division was in a 1‚Äì0 victory against Excursianistas which was played at Club Atl√©tico Atlanta's Estadio Don Le√≥n Kolbovski behind closed doors, only allowing a small number of fans for each team, the goal came in the 94th minute by striker Carlos Sal√≥m, who's attractive performance eventually earned him a spot with Argentine First Division club Olimpo. ===Primera B 2010‚Äì11=== Prior to the season, the club saw 9 new signings to the first-team after the departure of fan favourite Carlos Sal√≥m. Barracas welcomed former Lan√∫s goalkeeper Horacio Ramirez, who arrived back in Argentina from Peru's Coronel Bolognesi in January 2010, as well as 22-year-old striker Jorge Gonzalez from Puerto Rico's River Plate. Barracas kicked off the opening game at home in a 1‚Äì0 loss against Acassuso, it was not until round 6 where which they gained their first victory which was a 3‚Äì0 win at home against Nueva Chicago which saw two goals by new signing Sebastian Matos. Barracas finished in seventh spot on the table with 64 points earning them a play-off promotion tie with Nueva Chicago. Both teams tied 3‚Äì3, Sebastian Matos scoring two goals including an equaliser on 89 minutes. Nueva Chicago were promoted having finished in a higher position on the table. ==Stadium== Since 1916 the club's stadium is at the intersection of the streets Olavarria and Luna in the Capital federal, Argentina. Its construction, fencing, dressing rooms, offices, forums, were carried out in stages and by 1930 the stadium ultimately catered for 7,500 spectators. Until 1970, the stadium's structure remained almost entirely of wood, however it was all demolished, leaving only four cement steps on one side of the field to seat the Barracas fans. In late 2004, having suffered for a long time due to the bad state of the field, extensive work was carried out which resulted in proper water drainage that allowed just over two seasons to allow the field to be in excellent condition. In 2006 the club decided to build a grandstand full of cement to the visiting public with capacity for 600 spectators. The grandstands were constructed in the same place as to where the wooden grandstands were based in the past. In 2010, the club decided to move the Hooligans base from behind the goals to the side of the field, adding four more cement steps. The stadium sits approximately 30 metres from Club Atl√©tico Hurac√°n's Estadio Tom√°s Adolfo Duc√≥ and is also located next to La Villa of Barracas. ==PlayersCurrent squad=Out on loan=Titles== * Divisi√≥n Intermedia (1): 1919 AAm * Primera B (1): 2018‚Äì19 * Primera C (3): 1944, 1948, 2009‚Äì10 * Primera D (3): 1974, 1981, 2003‚Äì04 ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official website Category:Association football clubs established in 1904 Category:1904 establishments in Argentina Category:Football clubs in Buenos Aires ","title":"Barracas Central"},{"id":"7445591","text":"Easy may refer to: ==Arts, entertainment and mediaFilm and television=== * Easy (film), a 2003 American independent romantic comedy film * Easy!, or Scialla!, a 2011 Italian film * 'Easy (TV series), an American comedy-drama anthology series ===Music=== Albums *Easy (Easybeats album), 1965 *Easy (Nancy Wilson album), 1968 *Easy (Grant Green album), 1978 *Easy (Grinspoon album), 1999 *Easy (Kelly Willis album), 2002 *Easy (Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell album), 1969 *Easy (Ralph McTell album), 1974 *Easy, by Cowboy Mouth, 2000 Songs *\\"Easy\\" (Commodores song), 1977 **also recorded by Faith No More, 1992 **also recorded by Sky Ferreira, 2017 *\\"Easy\\" (Camila Cabello song), 2019 *\\"Easy\\" (Cro song), 2012 *\\"Easy\\" (Dragonette song), 2009 *\\"Easy\\" (Ice MC song), 1989 *\\"Easy\\" (Mat Zo and Porter Robinson song), 2013 *\\"Easy\\" (Paula DeAnda song), 2007 *‚ÄúEasy‚Äù (Rascal Flatts song), featuring Natasha Bedingfield, 2011 *‚ÄúEasy‚Äù (Sheryl Crow song), 2013 *\\"Easy\\" (Sugababes song), 2006 *\\"Easy\\", from Barenaked Ladies Are Me by Barenaked Ladies, 2006 *\\"Easy\\", from Bombastic by Bonnie McKee, 2015 *\\"Easy\\", from Night Driver by Busted, 2016 *‚ÄúEasy‚Äù, from Air Cut by Curved Air, 1973 *\\"Easy\\", by DaniLeigh, 2019 *\\"Easy\\", from Born on Flag Day by Deer Tick, 2009 *\\"Easy\\", from Ella Mai by Ella Mai, 2018 *\\"Easy\\", from Lovebox by Groove Armada, 2002 *\\"Easy\\", from Have One on Me by Joanna Newsom, 2010 *\\"Easy\\", from Earth by Matthew Sweet, 1989 *\\"Easy\\", from The Riddle by Nik Kershaw, 1984 *\\"Easy\\", from Push and Shove by No Doubt, 2012 *\\"Easy\\", from Boss Man by Rich the Kid, 2000 *\\"Easy\\", from Lanterns by Son Lux, 2013 *\\"Easy\\", from Weather by Tycho, 2019 *\\"Easy Easy\\", from 6 Feet Beneath the Moon by King Krule, 2013 *\\"Easy Easy\\", a single released by the Scotland national football team in 1974 *\\"Easy, a 2017 single by Tokio Hotel ===Radio and television stations=== *Easy FM, in Beijing, China *Easy FM (Kenya) *Easy FM (New Zealand) *Easy TV, in Ireland *Easy TV (Philippines) ==Businesses and organisations== * easyGroup, the holding company controlling the \\"easy\\" family of brands **EasyJet * Easy (store), a chain of South American homecenters. ==Other uses== *Hurricane Easy (disambiguation), a number of hurricanes called Easy *EASY Card, a series of linked contactless smartcard systems in Florida, U.S. *EASY programme, an application procedure for seeking asylum in Germany * Enhanced avionics system (EASy), an avionics suite used on Dassault Falcon business jets ==See also== * *EASE (disambiguation) *Ease (disambiguation) *Easy Come Easy Go (disambiguation) *EZ (disambiguation) *Izi (disambiguation) *Simple (disambiguation) *Take It Easy (disambiguation) *The Big Easy (disambiguation) *Eazy-E (1964‚Äì1995), an American rapper ","title":"Easy"},{"id":"7445593","text":"Shahada or Shahadah and anything similar can mean:- * Shahada, the Muslim creed * Martyrdom ==Places== * Shahada, Maharashtra, a town in Nandurbar district in Maharashtra state in India * Shahad, a town in ThƒÅne district in Maharashtra state in India ==People== * Greg Shahade, American chess player * Jennifer Shahade, American women's chess champion * Raghdan Shehadeh, Syrian footballer * Rasha Shehada, Palestine managing director * Salah Shahade, former member of Hamas ==Other== * Shahada (film), a 2010 German film ==See also== ","title":"Shahada (disambiguation)"},{"id":"7445597","text":"The Nicaraguan Democratic Movement (Movimiento Democr√°tico Nicarag√ºense - MDN) is a right-wing Nicaraguan political party with social democratic ideology.

Sarsfield (19 April 1902 ‚Äì 10 July 1943) was an officer of the United States Navy during World War II. Sarsfield was born in Brooklyn, New York, on 19 April 1902 and entered the United States Naval Academy in 1922. Upon his graduation on 3 June 1926, he was commissioned Ensign and served in Nevada (BB-36), (BB-34), and Hannibal (AG-1) before receiving submarine instruction in 1929 and torpedo training in 1930. During the next four years, he served successively in Greer (DD-145), Argonne (AP-4), and Constitution. Following duty with the 3d Naval District, he joined Badger (DD-126) in July 1935, and returned to New York in September 1937. He instructed naval reservists in the 3d Naval District for two years before reporting to Kearny (DD-432) on 10 June 1940 to serve as executive officer and navigator. He was commended by the Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, for \\"Leadership, personal courage and ingenuity in solving the many problems arising under adverse conditions\\" when Kearny was torpedoed off Iceland on 17 October 1941. Given command of McCormick (DD-223) on 8 December 1941, he was detached on 3 October to supervise the outfitting of Maddox (DD-622) and he assumed command of that destroyer at her commissioning on 3 October 1942. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for exceptionally meritorious conduct as commanding officer of Maddox when she attacked and probably sank an enemy submarine on 6 May 1943. While acting as an escort for an Atlantic convoy, the destroyer made contact with the submerged enemy submarine. Lt. Comdr. Sarsfleld took prompt and effective action and, with great skill, delivered two accurate depth charge attacks. The submarine was damaged by the first attack; and, after the second attack, it appeared briefly on the surface upside down. As a result of these attacks, which demonstrated Sarsfield's thorough training and sound decision, the submarine was probably sunk. Reported missing on 10 July 1943 and officially presumed dead on the next day, Comdr. Sarsfield was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross and cited for extraordinary heroism as commanding officer of Maddox during the invasion of Sicily on 10 July 1943. While his ship was supporting the assault at Gela, Maddox was attacked without warning and gravely damaged by one direct hit and two near misses by a German Ju 88 bomber. He remained on board supervising the abandonment of the rapidly sinking ship and helped greatly to save the lives of 9 officers and 65 men of the 284 on board. ==Namesake== In 1945, the destroyer USS Sarsfield (DD-837) was named in his honor.

The origin of the character was Buck Nix, a goat Smith drew in 1908 for the Chicago Evening Journal. For three years, Nix romanced a she-goat called Nanny. In 1911, Smith moved to the Chicago Tribune. He introduced a new goat character when Old Doc Yak began as a daily strip on February 19, 1912, with the Sunday page starting a few weeks later on March 3. Doc Yak was a family man and more mature than Buck Nix. He had a son, Yutch, along with a number of domestic problems. The last daily Old Doc Yak strip, on February 10, 1917, depicted Yak and his family moving out while wondering who might move into the house next. The last panel showed the empty house. The next day's newspapers, in the space formerly occupied by Old Doc Yak, printed the very first strip of Smith's The Gumps, showing the Gumps moving into the house formerly occupied by the Yak family. Old Doc Yak continued as a Sunday strip until June 15, 1919, when Yak was depicted selling his car to Andy Gump so he and Yutch could move away \\"to start life all over again\\". The Gumps likewise took over the Sunday space the following week.

Founded in 1989, the group is composed of Didier Sourou Awadi (alias DJ Awadi) and Amadou Barry (alias Doug E. Tee or Duggy-Tee), both of whom had previously been in other hip hop groups. They perform in the English, French, and Wolof languages and use traditional Senegalese instruments as part of their songs. Political and social activism have played important roles in the group since it was founded. ==History== The two members of Positive Black Soul were born in the city of Dakar, Senegal. As teenagers, Awadi and Barry were involved in the Dakar hip hop scene--Awadi leading his own group, Didier Awadi's Syndicate, a breakdancer as well as a rapper; and Barry performing with the King MCs. Originally Awadi and Barry were rivals, competing with each other in performances and coming from separate neighborhoods of Dakar. During a birthday party held by Awadi to which Barry was invited, however, the two performed together and realized their similarities, founding Positive Black Soul very soon after. Activism and politics are central parts of the group's philosophy--its shortened name (PBS) was a play on the Parti D√©mocratique S√©n√©galais initialism \\"PDS\\". In 1992, the group performed at a music festival held by the Dakar French Cultural Center, where the French rapper MC Solaar heard their performance and invited the group to open for him when he debuted in Dakar in October of that year. The rapper was impressed with Positive Black Soul, inviting them to continue performing with him in France. Two years later the group put out its first release, a cassette entitled Boul Fal√©. The album was followed by more touring in France, as well as in England and Switzerland. In the same year, the Senegalese musician Baaba Maal offered PBS the opportunity to be on his album Firin' in Fouta. Maal was signed to Mango Records and because of this recording with him, Positive Black Soul were signed as well. They released their album debut Salaam on Mango Records. After achieving success in Senegal and some abroad, the group continued touring, including 130 performances in 1997. They also began organizing concerts in Dakar and promoting new groups including Daara J and Pee Froiss. Positive Black Soul's first international release, New York Paris-Dakar, had been previously released as a cassette in Senegal. However it was only in 1997, six years after its initial appearance, that it was sold outside of the country. The American rapper KRS-One, one of the group's collaborators on the album, shared a similar philosophy and interest in Pan-Africanism with Awadi and Barry. In 2002, the group appeared on the Red Hot Organization's tribute album to Fela Kuti, Red Hot and Riot.

He lost a bid for the Republican senatorial nomination to succeed Joseph McCarthy in 1957. O'Konski represented a district that included much of the northwestern part of the state, including Rhinelander and Superior. However, after the 1970 census, Wisconsin lost a district, and most of O'Konski's territory was merged with Wisconsin's 7th congressional district represented by three-term Democratic Party member Dave Obey. O'Konski retained only about 40 percent of his former territory, a disadvantage he was unable to overcome despite his seniority. Even though Richard Nixon carried most of the district in the 1972 election, O'Konski was defeated.

It is situated in southern Syria, notable for the location of the Golan Heights. The governorate borders the countries of Lebanon, Jordan and Israel, and the Syrian governorates of Daraa and Rif Dimashq. Its area varies, according to different sources, from 685 km¬≤Syria - City Population - Cities, Towns & Provinces - Statistics & Map to 1,861 km¬≤.Syria Provinces The governorate had a population of 87,000 at the 2010 estimate. The nominal capital is the now abandoned city of Quneitra, destroyed by Israel before their withdrawal in June 1974 in the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War; since 1986, the de facto capital is Ba'ath City. During the Syrian Civil War, most of the portions of the governorate that are not held by Israel, were taken by various opposition and Jihadist forces. In the summer of 2018, the rebel-held areas in the governorate were retaken by the Syrian government. ==History== The area surrounding Quneitra has been inhabited for millennia. Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers are thought to have lived there, as evidenced by the discovery of Levallois and Mousterian flint tools in the vicinity.Takeru Akazawa, Kenichi Aoki, Ofer Bar-Yosef, Neanderthals and Modern Humans in Western Asia, p. 154. Springer, 1998. A settlement was established at least as early as the late Hellenistic period, and continued through the Roman and Byzantine times; it was known by the name \\"Sarisai\\". The settlement served as a stop on the road from Damascus to western Palestine. Saint Paul is said to have passed through the settlement on his way from Jerusalem to Damascus. The site of the Conversion of Paul was traditionally identified with the small village of Kokab, north-east of Quneitra, on the road to Damascus.Ivan Mannheim, \\"Biblical Damascus\\", in Syria & Lebanon Handbook, p. 100. 2001, Footprint Travel Guides. The governorate was established in 1964 by splitting it from the Rif Dimashq Governorate. ===Six-Day War=== Most of the governorate was captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. The deserted city remained in Israeli hands for the next six years. However, Israel and Syria remained in a state of war throughout this period (and, indeed, to the present day). The town gained a fresh symbolic value; it was seen by the Syrians as \\"the badge of Syria's defeat, an emblem of hatred between Syria and Israel and a cross [Syrian President Hafez al- Assad] had to bear.\\"Seale, Patrick. (1988). Asad of Syria: The struggle for the Middle East (p. 141). Berkeley: University of California Press ===Yom Kippur War=== During the first few days of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Quneitra was briefly recaptured by the Syrian Army before it was repulsed in an Israeli counter-offensive.\\"Tables turned on Arabs, Israel general says\\". The Times, 9 October 1973, p. 8 In the middle of October 1973 the Israeli counter-offensive started. The Syrians had massed nearly 1,000 tanks along a front. With a massive concentration of tanks, the Israelis lashed into the Syrian forces. The Syrians at first fell back, but then managed to counterattack and drive back into occupied territory. Quneitra changed hands several times. Finally, Israeli armored units, closely supported by Phantoms and Skyhawk fighter jets performing close air support with napalm strikes against the forward Syrian units, halted the Syrian drive and turned the Syrian Army back. Destruction of the city A group of settlers from Merom Golan ‚Äì a settlement established in 1967 ‚Äì took over an abandoned bunker in Quneitra and declared it to be a new settlement called Keshet (Quneitra in Hebrew). The settlers also set about razing the existing town to the ground. The leader of Merom Golan, Yehuda Harel, and another Merom Golan member, Shimshon Wollner, initiated the destruction of Quneitra, which was carried out by the Land Development Administration of the Jewish National Fund. Harel later described what happened: Wollner and Harel asked the Jewish National Fund to carry out the work, ostensibly to prepare an area for agricultural cultivation, but were refused as they did not have permission from the Israeli army. They then approached the Assistant to the Head of Northern Command and asked him to mark on a map which buildings the army needed. According to Harel, The buildings were systematically stripped,\\"Qunaytirah, Al-.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2007. with anything movable being removed and sold to Israeli contractors, before they were pulled apart with tractors and bulldozers.Lara Dunston, Terry Carter, Andrew Humphreys.

Time magazine's correspondent reported that \\"Most of its buildings are knocked flat, as though by dynamite, or pockmarked by shellfire.\\" Le Monde's Syria correspondent, in a report for The Times, gave a detailed eyewitness description of the destruction: > Today the city is unrecognisable.

The Times' correspondent saw the city for himself on 6 May, a month before the Israeli withdrawal, and described it as being \\"in ruins and deserted after seven years of war and dereliction. It looks like a wild west city struck by an earthquake and if the Syrians get it back they will face a major feat of reconstruction.

His report was broadcast on ITN's News at Ten programme. According to The Times' correspondent Edward Mortimer, \\"viewers were thus afforded a panoramic view of the city, which had stood almost completely empty since the Syrian army evacuated it in 1967. It could be seen that many of the buildings were damaged, but most of them were still standing.\\" After it was handed over, \\"very few buildings were left standing. Most of those destroyed did not present the jagged outline and random heaps of rubble usually produced by artillery or aerial bombardment. The roofs lay flat on the ground, 'pancaked' in a manner which I am told can only be achieved by systematic dynamiting of the support walls inside.\\" Mortimer concluded that the footage \\"establishes beyond reasonable doubt that much of the destruction took place after 12 May‚Äîat a time when there was no fighting anywhere near Kuneitra.\\"\\"A question mark over the death of a city.\\" The Times, 17 February 1975, p. 12 The United Nations established a Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories, which engaged a Swiss engineer Edward Gruner to investigate the damage.UN Secretary General: Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories; including Edward Gruner: Quneitra Report on Nature, Extent and Value of Damage. A/31/218 1 October 1976 Gruner and a team of surveyors spent four months in Quneitra, documenting every building and its condition. His report concluded that Israeli forces had deliberately destroyed the city prior to their withdrawal, including almost 4,000 buildings and a large amount of infrastructure, of value estimated at 463 million Syrian pounds. The report's conclusions were subsequently adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. It passed a resolution on 29 November 1974 describing the destruction of Quneitra as \\"a grave breach of the [Fourth] Geneva Convention\\" and \\"condemn[ing] Israel for such acts,\\" by a margin of 93 votes to 8, with 74 abstentions.\\"Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories\\", United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3240, 29 November 1974, A/RES/3240, unispal .

The Times, 22 February 1975 ===Syrian Civil War=== During the Syrian Civil War, by the autumn of 2014, most of the portions of the governorate that are not held by Israel, were captured by various opposition and jihadist forces, with only a small enclave remaining under pro-Ba'athist militias in the north. In June 2015, the rebels launched an offensive to capture the governorate, but were repelled by the Syrian Army. In October 2015, the rebels launched another offensive, which once again ended in a stalemate. Despite a semi-ceasefire set up by Russia and the US in September 2016, insurgents in the governorate declared a new offensive against the government forces there. In June and July 2018, the rebel-held areas in the governorate was almost entirely retaken by the Syrian Army and its allies with Russian air support, with only a marginal part remaining at the hands of the ISIL-allied Khalid ibn al-Walid Army near the Jordanian border. The rebel groups of Ahrar al-Sham, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, Southern Front, Army of Islam, Criterion Brigades and Army of Free Tribes evacuated from the area to Idlib under an agreement with the Syrian government.

English and other foreign (‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶∂‡ßÄ bideshi) borrowings add even more cluster types into the Bengali inventory, further increasing the syllable capacity to CCCVCCCC, as commonly used loanwords such as ‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶® ·π≠ren \\"train\\" and ‡¶ó‡ßç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶∏ glash \\"glass\\" are now even included in leading Bengali dictionaries. { align=\\"center\\" +Initial Clusters !ClusterSource language(s)Example(s) in orthographyExample(s) in transliterationTranslation - krSanskrit English‡¶ï‡ßÉ‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶ükrimi krike·π≠worm cricket (sport) - klSanskrit English‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§‡¶ø ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶∏klanti klashfatigue class - khrGreek (via English)‡¶ñ‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶®khrish·π≠anChristian - grSanskrit English‡¶ó‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶Æ ‡¶ó‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶ïgram grikvillage Greek - glSanskrit English‡¶ó‡ßç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶ø ‡¶ó‡ßç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶∏glani glashsorrow glass - ·π≠rEnglish‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶®·π≠rentrain - ·∏çrEnglish‡¶°‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶∞·∏çraibhardriver - trSanskrit‡¶§‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶∂trishthirty -style=\\"text- align:center\\" thrEnglish‡¶•‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßÅthruthrough - drSanskrit‡¶¶‡ßÉ‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶Ødrishshoview - dhrSanskrit‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶¨‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶ædhrubotaraNorth star - nrSanskrit‡¶®‡ßÉ‡¶§‡¶§‡ßç‡¶§‡ßç‡¶¨nrit√¥ttoanthropology - prSanskrit English‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶® ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶∂‡¶æ‡¶∞proshno presharquestion pressure - plSanskrit English‡¶™‡ßç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶¨‡¶® ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶®plabon plenflood plane - frEnglish‡¶´‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶∏fransFrance - flEnglish‡¶´‡ßç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶üflai·π≠flight -style=\\"text- align:center\\" brSanskrit English‡¶¨‡ßÉ‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶ü‡¶ø ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶∂brish·π≠i brashrain brush - blEnglish‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶â‡¶úblaujblouse - bhrSanskrit‡¶≠‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßÅbhrubrow -style=\\"text- align:center\\" mrSanskrit‡¶Æ‡ßÉ‡¶§‡ßç‡¶Ø‡ßÅmrittudeath - mlSanskrit‡¶Æ‡ßç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶®mlanmelancholy - skSanskrit English‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ï‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ß ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ï‡ßÅ‡¶≤sk√¥ndho skulshoulder school - skrEnglish‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßÅskruscrew - skhSanskrit‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ñ‡¶≤‡¶®skh√¥lonslip - s·π≠English‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ü‡ßá‡¶∂‡¶®s·π≠eshonstation - s·π≠rEnglish‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶üs·π≠re·π≠straight - stSanskrit‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶§‡¶Æ‡ßç‡¶≠st√¥mbhotower - strSanskrit‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶§‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßÄstriwoman -style=\\"text- align:center\\" sthSanskrit‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶•‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßÄ‡¶Ø‡¶ºsthaniolocal -style=\\"text- align:center\\" snSanskrit English‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶® ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶®‡ßãsnan snobath snow - spSanskrit English‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶™‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶ü ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶™‡ßá‡¶∂‡¶æ‡¶≤sp√¥sh·π≠o speshalclear special - sprSanskrit English‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶™‡ßÉ‡¶π‡¶æ ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶Çspriha springdesire spring (coil) - sfSanskrit‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶´‡ßÇ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶§‡¶øsfurtidelight - smEnglish‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶üsmar·π≠smart (good-looking) - srSanskrit‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶Æ‡¶ø‡¶ïsromiklaborer - slSanskrit English‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶≤‡ßÄ‡¶≤‡¶§‡¶æ ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶≤‡ßã‡¶ó‡¶æ‡¶®slilota slogan (protest) chant ( Most final consonant clusters were borrowed into Bengali from English, as in ‡¶≤‡¶ø‡¶´‡ßç‚Äå‡¶ü lif·π≠ \\"lift, elevator\\" and ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶ï b√™ngk \\"bank\\". However, final clusters do exist in some native Bengali words, although rarely in standard pronunciation.

DWU is a non-profit City of Dallas department that provides services to the city and 31 nearby communities, employs approximately 1450 people, and consists of 26 programs. DWU's budget is completely funded through the rates charged for water and wastewater services provided to customers. Rates are based on the cost of providing the services. (Dallas City Charter, Chapter XI, Section 14) The department does not receive any tax revenues. Primary authority and rules for the department are listed in Chapter 49 of the Dallas City Code. ==History== Private owners developed the first public water supply in Dallas in 1876. The first sewers were built in the 1880s primarily for storm water drainage. At that time the street runoff and domestic sewage went directly to the Trinity River. Dallas Water Utilities began as the City of Dallas Waterworks in 1881 when the city purchased a privately owned water company that had been providing Dallas with water since the 1870s. When Browder Springs proved an inadequate water source, the city turned to surface water sources such as the Trinity River and manmade lakes in 1903. ==Administration== DWU is a department in the City of Dallas and falls under its management scheme. It is managed by a director and five assistant directors for the five primary functional areas: Business Operations provides accounting, financial, and budget support to the Water Utilities Department; In addition, this program provides for the management of wholesale water and wastewater services to other governmental entities within the utility's service area. provides overall financial support to the Department in areas where the expenditures are not directly tied to the day-to-day operational and overhead aspects of the department. All such expenditures require special monitoring and control. Key items within General Expense and Debt Service include street rental, transfer to the construction funds, general fund cost reimbursement and debt service commitments Customer Operations provides customer relations, billings, credit and collections activities, customer information, and all meter- associated services to the water, wastewater and stormwater utility customers. Works to promote DWU conservation programs. Water Operations is responsible for operating and maintaining the facilities of the Water Utilities Department. These activities include the raw water impoundment and watershed management, and the purification, pumping and distribution of potable water. Wastewater Operations is responsible for collecting, transporting, controlling the discharge of, and treating domestic and industrial wastes; and maintaining treatment plants and pipelines in the wastewater system. Capital Improvement Operations plans, designs, constructs and inspects the capital projects needed to provide customers with water and wastewater facilities to meet the growth of the community, extension of water and wastewater mains, modification of facilities to meet changes in State and Federal regulatory requirements (Environmental Protection Agency Administrative Orders, Safe Drinking Water Act treatment parameters and Clean Water Act discharge limitations), and the rehabilitation and replacement of deteriorated or obsolete facilities. ==Business operationsWholesale services=== DWU has contractual relations with 31 wholesale water and wastewater customers. There are five general types of relationships: *Wholesale Treated Water Customers *Wholesale Untreated Water Customers *Wholesale Wastewater Customers *Wholesale Untreated Water Customers-Irrigation Only *Reciprocal Water and Wastewater Customers Wholesale customers to DWU include the communities of Addison, Carrollton, Cedar Hill, Cockrell Hill, The Colony, Coppell, Denton, DeSoto, Duncanville, Farmers Branch, Flower Mound, Glenn Heights, Grand Prairie, Grapevine, Highland Park, Hutchings, Irving, Lancaster, Lewisville, Mesquite, Ovilla, Red Oak, Richardson, Seagoville, University Park, and Wilmer, as well as Dallas County WCID #6, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, Ellis County WCID #1, and the Upper Trinity Regional Water District. ==Customer operationsConservation program=== Since the early 1980s City of Dallas Water Utilities has had conservation programs. Over the years activities have increased to include children activities, Water-Wise landscape seminars, an annual Water-Wise Landscape tour and more. In 2001, the Dallas City Council took conservation efforts to another level by adopting an irrigation ordinance which included time-of-day watering restrictions. In April 2012, the Council voted to adopt maximum twice-weekly watering, which allows outdoor irrigation only twice per week according to a schedule based on even/odd street address numbers. The ordinance and other measures have reduced gallons per capita per day in Dallas by 26% since 2001 resulting in: *An estimated water savings of over 316 billion gallons or 22 billion gallons annually *An energy savings of 694.5 million kilowatt hours of electricity *A reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 478,614 tons ===Meter reading=== DWU has over 300,000 meters in its system. Approximately 6800 are AMI Fixed network units. Meters range in size from 5/8\\" to 10\\" or larger. ==Water operationsWater distribution system=== The water distribution system of Dallas Water Utilities (DWU) is one of the largest in the United States. As of June 2003, DWU provided retail water service to just over 1.2 million people within the Dallas city limits. The major distribution system facilities include 28 pump stations (including the high service pump stations at the three water treatment plants), 11 ground storage reservoirs, 9 elevated tanks, and 78 vault structures separate from the major facilities, in addition to over of distribution and transmission main. The distribution system is divided into 17 pressure zones to maintain adequate water pressures throughout the system. There are four major pressure zones (Central Low, North High, East High, and South High), and five smaller secondary pressure zones (Meandering Way High, Red Bird High, Trinity Heights, Pleasant Grove, and Cedardale) which comprise most of the Dallas service area. Each of the nine major and secondary pressure zones are supplied by one or more pump stations and have elevated or ground storage facilities that establish the static hydraulic gradient for each zone. The remaining eight pressure zones are supplied from an adjacent pressure zone via pressure reducing valve, or single, small booster pump station. These pressure zones do not have storage facilities that establish their static hydraulic gradient. There are 35 pressure monitoring points throughout the distribution system that are not located at a major facility. These points are connected to the SCADA system, and are used to monitor hydraulic conditions within the distribution system. The distribution system consists of over of pipe with diameters ranging from less than to in diameter. The majority of the total pipe length is sized in diameter. About 88 percent of the distribution system is pipes sized or smaller in diameter. The DWU distribution system is made of several different pipe materials. Small diameter pipe materials include copper, galvanized iron, PVC, and cast iron. Larger diameter transmission mains are made of steel and various reinforced and prestressed concrete. Approximately 51 percent of the distribution system consists of grey cast iron pipe (CIP). The next most prevalent material types are ductile iron pipe (DIP) and PVC. ===Water sources=== Dallas' Long Range Water Supply Plan includes recommendations for water supplies to meet the needs of Dallas and the other cities served through 2050.2005 DWU Long Range Water Supply Plan The plan also includes water conservation and emergency water management plans. Dallas uses six reservoirs as sources for raw water: *Lake Ray Hubbard The City constructed, owns, operates and has available 100% of the permitted water supply for the Ray Hubbard Reservoir. Pumpage of water to nearby treatment facilities began in the summer of 1973. A 1959 water permit applies to the reservoir, its use, and also permits (under limited conditions) storage and usage of water pumped by pipeline from Tawakoni Balancing Reservoir in Northeast Texas. *Lewisville Lake *Grapevine Lake *Ray Roberts Lake *Lake Tawakoni *Lake Fork Reservoir Additionally Dallas has water rights to the following sources: *Lake Palestine‚Äîunconnected *Elm Fork Channel- near Lake Bachman on the Bachman Branch The Integrated Pipeline Project is a joint effort between the Tarrant Regional Water District (TRWD) and DWU that will bring additional water supplies to the rapidly growing Dallas/Fort Worth area within the next 10 years. Once completed, this pipeline will transport water from Lake Palestine, Cedar Creek Reservoir and Richland-Chambers Reservoir back to the TRWD and Dallas service areas. This project is jointly funded by TRWD and DWU, saving taxpayers millions of dollars and exhibiting a commitment by the region's two largest water providers to work together to meet the region's future water needs. Construction is expected to be complete by 2018. ===Water treatment=== The city owns and operates three drinking water treatment plants: *East Side-The current treatment capacity of the East Side Water Treatment Plant (ESWTP) is per day. An expansion to per day is currently underway, and is projected to be completed in 2013. *Elm Fork-The current treatment capacity of the Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant (EFWTP) is per day. *Bachman-The Bachman Water Treatment Plant (BWTP) first began treating water in 1930 at a capacity of per day. Since 1930 the plant has undergone several major expansions to bring its capacity to per day. ==Wastewater operationsWastewater collection system=== In the 1800s wastewater management consisted of releasing untreated wastewater directly into the Trinity River. In 1913 the Texas legislature passed an anti-pollution law that directed all cities with populations greater than 50,000 to cease discharging untreated wastewater into streams. In January 1917 Dallas completed a per day wastewater treatment plant, the Central WWTP, to comply with this law. The plant was expanded to keep up with Dallas‚Äô growth in the 1920s. Service was expanded to Highland Park and University Park in the 1930s. In 1964 the Central WWTP was augmented with a per day Southside Oxidation Pond Facility (now called the Southside WWTP). For convenience in managing the city's extensive network of interceptor and collector sewers, DWU has divided the system into a number of primary sewer basins based on the drainage pattern for the sewers within the basin. There are 12 primary basins. Ten of the basins transport flow to Dallas treatment plants. These basins are (alphabetically) the Elam Creek, East Bank, Five Mile Creek, Hickory Creek, Prairie Creek, South Dallas, Warren Avenue, West Bank and White Rock Creek Basins. Each basin is named for, and discharges flow into, the major interceptor sewer line traversing the area. The other two primary basins transport flow to other regional sewer providers. These basins, the TRA and Garland basins, are named after the regional provider. The primary basins are further divided into smaller drainage basins, termed sewersheds. 48 of the sewersheds are tributary to Dallas wastewater treatment plants, three of the sewersheds are tributary to the Trinity River Authority (TRA) system, and one is tributary to the Garland system. The DWU Wastewater Collection System is over long and includes 15 lift stations. Pipe sizes in the system range from 4\\" to 120\\" inches. DWU's wastewater collection program is primarily responsible for the pipes built outside the plant footprints. Key activities of this program include: * Sewer line maintenance (root control, mechanical cleaning, high velocity pressure cleaning, rehabilitation, repair, and point repairs) * Emergency response * Television inspection * Flow monitoring ===Wastewater treatment=== The city operates two wastewater sewage treatment plants, Central and Southside. The Central Wastewater Treatment Plant (CWWTP) has a design treatment capacity of per day, and treats an average flow of about 100 MGD. The peak treatment capacity of CWWTP is rated at per day. City of Dallas's Central Wastewater Treatment Plant (CWWTP) is a conventional activated sludge plant with trickling filters. DWU Central WWTP is in operation for more than 100 years and has gone through various changes throughout those years. Most prominently, after the introduction of Clean Water Act, activated sludge was included to the treatment process along with trickling filters. DWU Central plant is divided in to three major sections: Dallas plant, White Rock plant, and Activated Sludge Plant. Wastewater flows from various sections of the City come through Cadiz pump station or via White Rock interceptors to both Dallas plant and White Rock plant. After the primary treatment (including bar screens, primary clarifications and trickling filters) at both of these plants, the flow is combined at Activated Sludge Influent Pump Station (ASIPS) which is then diverted to Complex A and Complex B for activated sludge process. Effluent of activated sludge process passes through secondary clarification and then disinfected using gaseous chlorine in chlorine contact chambers. After disinfection, effluent is filtered through dual-media gravity filters and de-chlorinated before discharging into the Trinity River. DWU Central plant pumps its sludge to DWU Southside wastewater treatment plant for the anaerobic digestion. DWU Central plant provides Type II reuse water to a city park and two city-owned golf courses. The reuse water has residual chlorine per requirement. DWU Central Plant currently has six (6) ‚ÄúA‚Äù, seven (7)‚ÄùB‚Äù, 14 ‚ÄúC‚Äù, and five (5) ‚ÄúD‚Äù Texas Commission on Environmental Quality TCEQ Certified operators on staff. CWWTP is ISO 9001, 14001, and 18000 compliant. CWWTP maintenance staff has implemented predictive maintenance program (PdM), Lean Six Sigma as well as utilized drone technologies to manage assets while reducing risks. Awards Received by DWU's Central Wastewater Treatment Plant (CWWTP): *WEAT Plant of the year award for Year 2016 (State) *WEAT Operator of the Year Award (State) *WEAT George Burke Safety Award (State) *WEF Water Heroes Award (National) CWWTP was also nominated for the Resilient Utility of the Year Award for year 2017. The Southside Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWWTP) has a maximum capacity of 160 MGD and treats an average flow of about 65 MGD. Both CWWTP and SSWWTP are permitted by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to discharge to the Trinity River. ===Pretreatment and Laboratory Services=== Pretreatment and Laboratory Services (PALS) administers local, state, and federal regulations to control pollutants discharged from commercial and industrial users (IUs) within the city of Dallas which may pass through or interfere with the city's Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW). The city's POTW consists of two wastewater treatment plants treating up to per day, fourteen pump stations, and over of sanitary sewer collection pipelines. The Pretreatment Program administers and enforces the regulations in order to: *Protect the city's wastewater collection systems, treatment plants, and workers *Allow the beneficial re-use of bio-solids *Allow the reclamation of treated effluent for irrigation and other uses *Maintain water quality in the Trinity River. POTWs are designed to treat typical household wastes and biodegradable commercial and industrial wastes. Commercial and industrial facilities that discharge toxic pollutants to the treatment plants may be very detrimental to treatment plant processes and the environment. IUs which discharge pollutants into the POTW are required to install, operate, and adequately maintain pretreatment equipment to remove pollutants that could otherwise damage, obstruct, interfere with, or pass through the POTW. Examples of such pollutants include heavy metals, cyanides, toxic organics, and acidic or basic wastes from industrial operations. Heavy metals and some organic chemicals which cannot be treated by the biological treatment process can threaten the bacteria which are necessary to the treatment process at the wastewater treatment plants. Wastewater from restaurants and other food service industries are often more problematic due to the prevalence of conventional pollutants such as grease, organic matter and solids. Grease can clog and overload the sewer system. Processing these food contaminants raises the cost of treating wastewater. The Pretreatment Program protects the treatment process and keeps costs down by working with local businesses to minimize pollutant discharges. Activities of the city's Pretreatment Program include the review of pretreatment designs, the issuance of permits, facility inspections, monitoring of facilities (wastewater sample collection), review of industry self-monitoring reports, and enforcement activities. PALS also operates 2 Process Laboratories, one for each of the two wastewater treatment plants, and an Analytical Laboratory, whose primary function is the analysis of industrial wastes discharged to the collection system. ==Capital improvement operations== DWU's goal is to continually, evaluate, upgrade and replace its water and wastewater assets in order to make both systems operate efficiently. The Capital Program consists of five programs: Engineering Services, Pipeline Program, Utility Automation and Integration (UAI), Wastewater Facilities, Water Facilities. Engineering Services is primarily responsible for updating pipeline design related manuals, relocating pipes in advance of pavement, and designing pipeline projects. Relocations is a section within Engineering Services whose primary function is the work with Texas Department of Transportation, Dallas County, the Army Corps of Engineers, City of Dallas Public Works & Transportation in a joint effort to replace designated pipes in advance of pavement renewal or other projects that impact the DWU water or wastewater pipeline systems. Pipeline Program is primarily responsible for the study, evaluation and construction of water or wastewater lines.

Literally ‚ÄòMountain Removed from Worldliness,‚Äô Songnisan is where the 7th-century Buddhist Beopjusa temple is still located. ==Park Details== The park total area is 234.5 km2 and is divided into three areas. These are Beopjusa, Hwayang, and Hwabuk. Over 1000 species of fauna live in the park and there are at least 830 species of flora. There are a total of 9 peaks, and 17 known temples. The Beopjusa Buddhist temple is the largest temple in central Korea and home to several Korean national treasures and the world's largest bronze Buddha.Korea National Park Service, 2006 Before the entrance, and on the hillsides above the Beopjsua temple there are many sculptures of turtles. One can be seen in the river just down stream of the temple and it is made from three boulders. One boulder with carved eyes representing the head and two representing the front flippers. ==Munjangdae== Originally, Munjangdae(Î¨∏Ïû•ÎåÄ, ÊñáËóèËá∫) was called Unjangdae(Ïö¥Ïû•ÎåÄ, Èõ≤ËóèËá∫) because of a big peak rises high into sky and is hidden in the cloud.

He was born in Boral in 24 Parganas and studied at the Hare School and Hindu College, both premier institutions in Kolkata, Bengal at the time. A monotheist at heart, Rajnarayan Basu converted to Brahmoism at the age of twenty. After retiring, he was given the honorary title of Rishi or sage. As a writer, he was one of the best known prose writers in Bengali in the nineteenth century, writing often for the Tattwabodhini Patrika, a premier Brahmo journal. Due to his defence of Brahmoism, he was given the title \\"Grandfather of Indian Nationalism\\"\\"The Brahmo Samaj and the shaping of the modern Indian mind By David Kopf\\", page 315, https://books.google.com/books?id=IUcY_IRKDHQC&pg;=PA315\\"Makers Of Indian Literature Prem Chand By Prakash Chandra Gupta\\", back cover, https://books.google.com/books?id=DuoHFioSmBoC&pg;=PT1 ==Birth and early life== Rajnarayan Basu was born on 7 September 1826 in the Boral village of South 24 Parganas of West Bengal. The ancestral seat of the Basu family was Garh Gobindopur, Kolkata. His father Nanda Kishore Basu was a disciple of a Raja Ram Mohan Roy and later one of his secretaries. A bright student since childhood, Rajnarayan was brought to Calcutta (modern Kolkata) and was admitted to Hare School Society's School (later known as Hare School). He studied there till the age of 14, and was notified by the teachers for his brilliance and intellect. He married Prasannamoyee Mitra in 1843. After the death of his first wife, he married Nistarini Dutta daughter of Shri Abhayacharan Dutta of the Hatkhola Dutta family in 1847. ==Career== Rajnarayan Basu was a rival of Michael Madhusudan Dutt, a prominent poet of the time, and the introducer of free verse in Bengali. Both were responsible for introducing classical Western elements into Bengali literature. He briefly tutored Asia's first Nobel Prizewinner, Rabindranath Tagore and spent three years translating the Upanishads into English on the earnest request and co-operation of Devendranath Tagore. As a member of Young Bengal, Rajnarayan Basu believed in \\"nation-building\\" at the grassroots level. To do his part, after teaching at Vidyasagar's Sanskrit College as the second master of the English Department, he moved to Midnapore to teach in the mofussil district town. He served as the headmaster of Midnapore Zilla School (later known as Midnapore Collegiate School) which was also the forerunner of Midnapore College. == Work life in Midnapore == He had joined the school on 21 February 1851 preceded by Mr. Sinclare, during whose time the school lost its glory and was in a deplorable condition. Rajnarayan's first goal was to reestablish the school in the firmament of education. The great teacher and educationist took some wonderful steps: # He had abolished corporal punishment and introduced a friendly and cooperative atmosphere among the teachers and students to make education more interesting to them. # He had immense hatred against the well-practiced procedure of \\" committing to memory and vomiting to paper\\". He always followed the rule of teaching through interaction of both students and teachers. His eloquent speeches with humorous jokes gradually attracted even the heart of the most dull student in the class. He put stress on interrogative teaching, so that the fundamentals of the student becomes strong. # He understood that the students also need place for physical exercise and sports so that there mental and physical power can be properly manifested, so he made a Lawn Tennis Court and a Gymnasium in the school premises. # He wanted students to be educated in \\" Character Making Education\\", so he advised teachers to look after the moral development of the students, so that they can be \\" Man in a true sense.\\" # He observed that students sitting in benches without back- support, cannot keep there back straight, so their attention span becomes shorter while studying. So he introduced sits with back-supports for the first time. # Being an active leader of Young Bengal, he was moved by the 'Academic Association' of Henry Louis Vivian Derozio. So he also introduced Debate Associations and Mutual Improvement Association in school level. He also established the first arch of women education in Midnapore, the first girls school and a night school for educating the illiterates. He established a public library that is still in use, although now it is known as the Rishi Rajnarayan Basu Smriti Pathagar (Rishi Rajnaraya Basu Memorial Library) which is the oldest public library in West Bengal. He was the first person to suggest using Bengali at meetings of the Vangiya Sahitya Parishad (Bengali literature society). The Parishad was established to promote Bengali language literature yet ironically conducted meetings in English until Basu's request. As an intellectual, he founded the Brahmo Samaj house and inaugurated Nabagopal Mitra's Hindu Mela, an organisation created to spread nationalist feelings among Indians. He was a member of the Indian Association and a member of a political group called the Sanjibani Sabha. He also lamented that there were no schools promoting the learning of Indian music among the middle- classMicrosoft Word ‚Äì front.doc and he himself started one in Midnapore. In 1868, he retired and moved to Deoghar where he spent the last years of his life. His grandson, eminent philosopher and freedom-fighter, Sri Aurobindo has inscribed his tribute to Rajnarayan in a beautiful sonnet. ==Select bibliographyIn Bengali=== * Brahmo Sadhon (Serving Brahmoism)(1865) * Dharmatatvo Dipika (The Light of Religious Theory) (1866‚Äì67) * Hindudhormer srestotto (The superiority of Hinduism)(1873) * Sekal aar eikaal (Then and now) (1873) * Hindu othoba Presidency College-er itibritto (A history of the Hindu or Presidency College) (1876) * Bibidho probondho (Various essays) (1882) * Rajnarayan Basur Attocharit (Autobiography) (1909) ===In English=== * A defence of Brahmoism and the Brahmo Samaj (1863) * Brahmic Advice, Caution, and Help (1869) * The Adi Brahmo Samaj, its views and principles (1870) * The Adi Brahmo Samaj as a Church (1873) ==ReferencesExternal links== * Chronology of Life-events Category:Bengali writers Category:Bengali-language writers Category:Vangiya Sahitya Parishad Category:Brahmos Category:Hare School alumni Basu Rajnarayan Basu Rajnarayan Category:People from Midnapore Category:Bengali Hindus ","title":"Rajnarayan Basu"},{"id":"7445799","text":"√Ålvaro Mej√≠a Florez (born May 15, 1940 in Medell√≠n, Antioquia) is a former long-distance runner from Colombia, who became a national hero after competing in the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games 5,000 meter final.

An Orthopaedic nurse is responsible for assessing new patients for their conditions, watching the condition of their current patients, providing treatments and medication. As part of this role, the nurse also monitors vital signs, looks over the surgical sight, changes dressings, and notifies the doctor of any change in the patient's condition. Finally, the Orthopaedic nurse also performs general nursing techniques, such as changing bedpans, assisting the patient with walking, enforcing care plans, providing IV medication, and informing and supporting the patient and their families. The optimal goal for the Orthopaedic nurse is to keep the patient comfortable, which may require turning the patient and providing pain relievers as needed. == Exam and Certification == The Orthopaedic certification exam contains 150 questions,135 of which are scored while the other 15 do not affect the test score. A 97% is needed to pass the exam. Results are hosted by AMP, which is ONCB's test vendor. The ONCB then distributes the results directly to the new certified holder. The ONCB does not distribute the results to individual agencies and only uses a pass or fail system for future exams. The exam is usually given in the Fall and Spring and is offered around the United States. To take the certification exam the nurse has to be licensed and have at least 2 years experience, but doesn't need a bachelor's degree. Nurses must have 1000 hours of Orthopaedic patient care within the last 3 years. Certification lasts for 5 years, after which recertification or continuing education is required. == Recertification == Recertification in Orthopeadic Nursing requires 1000 practice hours logged in an applicant's past 5 years and 100 hours of education: 70 hours in Orthopaedics and 30 hours in general nursing. The application should be handed in as soon as possible. The application can take 8 weeks to process. Paper applications should be mailed with a return receipt. == Salary == On average, an Orthopaedic nurse draws a salary of $69,000 a year. The need for professional Orthopaedic nurses is expected to increase by 19% in 2022. The number of jobs will increase at a higher rate due to aging adults at risk of arthritis, fractures, and many other Orthopaedic problems. ==See also== *List of nursing credentials ==External links== *Orthopaedic Nurses Certification Board website ==References== Category:Nursing credentials and certifications Category:Orthopedics ","title":"Orthopaedic Nurse Certified"},{"id":"7445831","text":"A Thief in Paradise is a 1925 American silent film, produced by Samuel Goldwyn, directed by George Fitzmaurice, and adapted by Frances Marion from Leonard Merrick's novel The Worldlings (1900).

Co-star Charles Youree plays the role of Philip Jardine, the wayward son of a San Francisco millionaire. The men are part-time pearl fishers on a tropical island and, during an underwater fight for a pearl, Jardine is attacked and killed by a shark. After his death, Aileen Pringle playing the role of Rosa Carmino, informs Blake that she has a letter from Jardine's wealthy father, urging him to return to San Francisco. The envelope containing the letter includes $500 to pay for transportation. Carmino, knowing that Jardine's father has never seen his fully grown son, implores Blake to impersonate him. The two thieves, as they are alluded to in the movie's title, arrive in San Francisco and are welcomed by the Jardine family. Soon, Blake falls in love with a neighbor named Helen played by Doris Kenyon. Carmino, jealous of the affair, is paid off by Blake to maintain her silence. However, after Blake marries Helen, Carmino tells Helen the true story. Blake admits the truth to Helen and despondent, tries to kill himself.

Reminiscent of African turacos when walking along tree branches, they likewise feature brightly coloured bare skin around the eyes. Some resemble coucals in their habit of clambering through plant tangles while foraging, while the arboreal species move between tree canopies with gliding flight. Four species occur (red) in rainforests while the remaining six are found in the dry forests of western and southern Madagascar. They have large feet, with a reversible third toe like all cuckoos. Their long tibia suggest a relationship with the Carpococcyx ground-cuckoos of Asia, a genus with similar nestlings. Consequently, they are sometimes united in the subfamily Couinae. Couas build their own nests and lay white eggs. Couas' calls are short series of evenly spaced notes, which are sometimes answered by other individuals. ==Taxonomy== The genus Coua was erected by the Swiss naturalist Heinrich Rudolf Schinz in 1821 with the giant coua (Coua gigas) as the type species.

It is primarily used by traffic exiting the Lincoln Tunnel. Dyer Avenue runs between 30th Street and 42nd Street but functions as three distinct sections due to its connections with the south and center tubes of the Lincoln Tunnel. The southernmost section, between 30th and 31st Streets, leads to and from the Lincoln Tunnel Expressway. Dyre Avenue also exists between 34th and 36th Streets, and between 40th and 42nd Streets; both sections lead directly from the tunnel, but the 34th-36th Streets section also contains a roadway leading to the tunnel. The avenue is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.http://www.panynj.gov/press-room/press- item.cfm?headLine_id=2072 ==Description== Dyer Avenue runs between Ninth and Tenth Avenues and exists in three sections, located between 30th-31st Streets, 34th-36th Streets, and 40th-42nd Streets in south-to-north order. The Lincoln Tunnel's southernmost tube, which carries eastbound traffic to New York, surfaces just northeast of the intersection of 38th Street and Tenth Avenue. It leads directly to both the central and southern legs of Dyer Avenue. The center tube, which is reversible, ascends to ground level just southeast of 39th Street and Tenth Avenue, parallel to the southernmost tube. The center tube funnels directly into the southbound Lincoln Tunnel Expressway, but an exit ramp also leads to the central and southern legs of Dyre Avenue. The northern tube, carrying westbound traffic to New Jersey, does not connect directly from Dyer Avenue, but can be accessed via ramps from the Lincoln Tunnel Expressway. Vehicles exiting the south tube of the Lincoln Tunnel can exit directly onto the central section of Dyer Avenue, between 36th and 34th Streets. Traffic exiting the center tube may also access Dyer Avenue by using an exit ramp from the Lincoln Tunnel Expressway that merges with Dyer Avenue before its intersection with West 36th Street. At this intersection, there is also a southbound entrance ramp to the Lincoln Tunnel Expressway and to the southern section of Dyer Avenue. This ramp permits traffic from the south tube of the tunnel to access the expressway; however, the amount of traffic using this entrance ramp is relatively low because the Lincoln Tunnel Expressway ends a few blocks to the south at West 30th Street and was never connected to the proposed Mid-Manhattan Expressway. Drivers entering the tunnel can travel northbound on Dyer Avenue for a brief segment between 34th and 36th Streets. At 36th Street, northbound Dyer Avenue merges with a ramp from southbound Ninth Avenue that continues to the Lincoln Tunnel Expressway and provides access to the center and north tubes of the Lincoln Tunnel. A ramp leading from the southern section of Dyer Avenue leads to the northbound Lincoln Tunnel Expressway, which continues directly into the northern tube. North of West 39th Street, Dyer Avenue is used by northbound vehicles exiting the south and center tubes of the Lincoln Tunnel. Before the intersection with West 40th Street, there are direct ramps leading up to the Port Authority Bus Terminal that are used by buses (to the upper levels of the terminal's north and south wings) and cars (to the parking garage above the south wing of the terminal). Another large parking garage is located on West 42nd Street, opposite the end of Dyer Avenue. Squeegee men used to target motorists stopped at traffic signals in this area. The northern section of Dyer Avenue previously had a contraflow lane for buses to access the center tube of the Lincoln Tunnel during the evening rush hour on weekdays. ==History== Dyer Avenue is named after General George Rathborne Dyer, who was the chairman of the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and died while the Lincoln Tunnel was under construction. A number of buildings in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood were demolished in order to construct the right-of-way of the new avenue and provide access to the Lincoln Tunnel, of which the first (now the center) tube opened in December 1937. In 2003, as part of the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project, the New York City Department of City Planning issued a master plan that envisioned the creation of a network of open space between Ninth Avenue and Tenth Avenue to create a park system from West 39th Street to West 34th Street, portions of which would be located along Dyer Avenue. ==References== Dyer Category:Lincoln Tunnel Category:Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan Category:Chelsea, Manhattan Category:Hudson Yards, Manhattan ","title":"Dyer Avenue"},{"id":"7445882","text":"{ class=\\" floatright\\" border=\\"1\\" - + Example protein half-lives !

Different types of proteins have very different turnover rates. A balance between protein synthesis and protein degradation is required for good health and normal protein metabolism. More synthesis than breakdown indicates an anabolic state that builds lean tissues, more breakdown than synthesis indicates a catabolic state that burns lean tissues. According to D.S. Dunlop, protein turnover occurs in brain cells the same as any other eukaryotic cells, but that \\"knowledge of those aspects of control and regulation specific or peculiar to brain is an essential element for understanding brain function.\\" Protein turnover is believed to decrease with age in all senescent organisms including humans. This results in an increase in the amount of damaged protein within the body. == Protein turnover in the exercise science == Four weeks of aerobic exercise has been shown to increase skeletal muscle protein turnover in previously unfit individuals.Aerobic Exercise Training Increases Skeletal Muscle Protein Turnover in Healthy Adults at Rest by Pikosky et. al A diet high in protein increases whole body turnover in endurance athletes.Level of dietary protein impacts whole body protein turnover in trained males at rest by Gaine, et. al Dietary protein intake impacts human skeletal muscle protein fractional synthetic rates after endurance exercise by Bolster et. al Some bodybuilding supplements claim to reduce the protein breakdown by reducing or blocking the number of catabolic hormones within the body. This is believed to increase anabolism. However, if protein breakdown falls too low then the body would not be able to remove muscle cells that have been damaged during workouts which would in turn prevent the growth of new muscle cells. ==References== Category:Protein biosynthesis ","title":"Protein turnover"},{"id":"7445886","text":"The Social Christian Party (Partido Social Cristiano ‚Äì PSC) is a Nicaraguan political party with Christian democrat ideology founded in 1957.

Founded in 1918, Atlante were original members of the Mexican professional league when it began in 1943. Atlante has won three national league championships, two from their original home in Mexico City, and the most recent following their 2007 relocation to Canc√∫n before eventually returning to Mexico City. They are also three-time winners of the Copa M√©xico, and twice winners of the CONCACAF Champions' Cup / CONCACAF Champions League. Atlante currently compete in Mexico's second-tier Ascenso MX following relegation from Liga MX at the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season. ==HistoryThe beginning=== Atlante was founded on April 18, 1916 with the name Sinaloa by a group of young Mexican football enthusiasts, led by Refugio \\"El Vaquero\\" Mart√≠nez. The team began playing at La Condesa neighborhood in Mexico City. After changing its name to Lusitania and U-53, Refugio Mart√≠nez proposed the name Atlante, after the mighty battles fought at the Atlantic Ocean during World War I. During the 1920s, players such as the Rosas brothers, Manuel \\"Chaquetas\\" Rosas, Felipe \\"Diente\\" Rosas, as well as Juan \\"El Trompo\\" Carre√±o, they all helped to propel Atlante in becoming one of the most popular teams, mostly among the working classes, which led to its most famous and legendary nickname, El Equipo del Pueblo, \\"People's team\\". Atlante's legend Juan Carre√±o scored Mexico's first goal in the Olympic Games in Amsterdam 1928, as well as Mexico national team's first ever goal in a FIFA World Cup during the inaugural match against France in Uruguay 1930. Despite its popularity, the Mexican Federation did not allow the team to be involved at the Mexican championship, the Liga Mayor. In order for Atlante to be allowed into the league, it had to win several proof-matches against Toluca and Am√©rica, two powerful football clubs. The duels were finally won by Atlante with scores of 7‚Äì2 and 2‚Äì1, respectively. Accepted within the Liga Mayor, Atlante formed a major rivalry against Necaxa, which became the first classic in Mexican football. The games between these two were furious battles, even drawing in points at the end of the 1931‚Äì32 tournament. Through the beginnings of the history of the football in Mexico, when famed foreign teams began to challenge the Mexican teams, they swept with most clubs except one: Atlante. What today many do not recall is that Atlante was the first Mexican team that acquired national fame by knocking down those foreign \\"giants\\". In 1929, Atlante defeated Sabaria of Hungary 3‚Äì1. In 1930, Atlante defeated two times the Sportivo of Buenos Aires 2‚Äì1 and 3‚Äì2. And one of their more recalled feats was the 3‚Äì2 victory in 1931 over Bella Vista of Uruguay who had three players that won the first World Cup a year before in Montevideo. In the 1940s, during the final years of World War II, Atlante's Horacio Casar√≠n began being noticed for his tremendous skill and ability, which also led him to become a major figure in the Mexico national team. Propelling Atlante's popularity, it was even brought to the big screen in many films of the country's cinematographic golden era. Some of those films are \\"Los Hijos de Don Venancio\\", \\"Los Nietos de Don Venancio\\", \\"El Vividor\\", \\"El que con ni√±os se acuesta\\", among many others. Players Horacio Casar√≠n and Mart√≠ Ventolr√† were even part of those films' casting. ===Professional era and first championship title=== In 1943, the Mexican Federation founded the Professional League with six clubs of the Primera Fuerza of Mexico City, two clubs from the Liga Occidental (Western League) and two members from the Liga Veracruzana (Veracruz League), being Atlante one of those six clubs of Mexico City. Together, they all became what is known today as the Mexican Primera Divisi√≥n. After 4 tournaments, and with the aid of its owner General Jose Manuel Nu√±ez (a retired militar asked personally by former President L√°zaro C√°rdenas to watch over the team) as well as of its sensational player Horacio Casar√≠n, the team obtained its first championship in the 1946‚Äì47 season. The final match against Le√≥n was attended by 48,622 people, including the current President Miguel Alem√°n Vald√©s (he even got into the field after the match in a famous photograph with the champions). Before that, in 1945 the team imposed the Latin American record for more goals in a single season with 121 goals in 30 matches (more than four goals per game). Atlante also became the first Mexican team to be crowned at the Champion of Champions cup (a super cup scheme championship) during the 1941‚Äì42 season. After the first title, several other teams dominated the championship; nevertheless, Atlante remained as a powerful rival and still a popular team for the working classes, along with its runner-up, Mexican Cup and the Champion of Champions titles in the early 1950s. In 1966, General Jose Manuel Nu√±ez decided to sell the team to Fernando Gonz√°lez, \\"Fernand√≥n\\". Poor level and irregular campaigns proceeded the selling, which led Atlante to be relegated from the Primera Divisi√≥n to Segunda Divisi√≥n in 1976. ===The IMSS era=== The team managed to return to the Primera Divisi√≥n for the 1977‚Äì78 season. In October 1978, the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) acquired the team in a 100% ownership, promising to make the largest football club in the world with 22 million associates throughout the country. With the financial support of the governmental institution, the team experienced successful campaigns with reinforcements such as the old-time idol Horacio Casar√≠n as head coach and the Mexican football's all-time top goalscorer Cabinho, who would become three-time champion striker with Atlante in 1980, 1981 and 1982. Its productive campaigns led them to the 1981‚Äì82 final championship match against Tigres UANL, and after regular and extra time, Atlante became runner-up at penalty kicks. Nevertheless, a year later Atlante won its first continental title with the CONCACAF Champions' Cup against Suriname's Robinhood. While the government still owned the team, another institution took over the management activities. The Departamento del Distrito Federal, DDF (the former body which controlled the Mexican Federal District) intended to propel the team with little results. After playing for several years at the Estadio Azteca, the team even had to leave this venue and setting its new battleground at the Estadio Ciudad de los Deportes, nowadays Cruz Azul's Estadio Azul. In 1989, the media broke out with a major news: The DDF sold the team to Jose Antonio Garc√≠a, a businessman owner of the sports' goods & apparel company Garcis. After a failed campaign at a new venue, this time at Quer√©taro's Estadio Corregidora, the team was relegated, again, to the Segunda Divisi√≥n. ===Second championship title=== Right from its ashes, and back to its homeground Estadio Ciudad de los Deportes, now rebaptized as Estadio Azulgrana, Atlante managed to make an incredible come back to the Primera Divisi√≥n, after 3 outstanding games against Pachuca in the final series for the Segunda Divisi√≥n Championship. After the series' end, which led to extra time, penalty kicks and sudden death, Atlante's goalkeeper F√©lix Fern√°ndez scored the last penalty kick for a 9‚Äì8 final score. In 1992‚Äì93, and guided by Ricardo La Volpe, Atlante obtained its second championship title against Monterrey, with the final match played at Monterrey's stadium, Estadio Tecnol√≥gico. Atlante's new legends from that championship title included: 2011 U-17 champion coach Ra√∫l Guti√©rrez, Felix Fern√°ndez, former Atlante coaches Miguel Herrera, Jos√© Guadalupe Cruz, and Ren√© Isidoro Garc√≠a, Pedro Massacessi, Wilson Graneolatti, Roberto Andrade, Guillermo Cant√∫, and feared strikers Luis Miguel Salvador and Daniel Guzm√°n. The team was crowned as champion for the second time in 45 years. By winning the title, Atlante was again able to access the Concacaf Champions Cup, which eventually was lost against Cartagin√©s of Costa Rica in the final match. After winning the championship title, Atlante was eliminated for the next years from the play- off stage, even with important acquisitions such as Hugo S√°nchez, Jorge Campos & Venezuelan player Gabriel Miranda, among others. Once again, the team faced relegation issues; therefore, Grupo Televisa decided to acquire Atlante and move it back again to the Estadio Azteca. With this boost, Atlante was able to be reinforced by notable players, such as Zague, Mart√≠n Felix Ubaldi, Jos√© Damasceno Tiba, and Luis Garc√≠a, as well as the renamed coach Miguel Mej√≠a Bar√≥n, who just had a positive result coaching the National team at United States' World Cup 1994. Despite in having memorable campaigns, such as being the first all-championship leader for a short tournament (Invierno 1996), and qualifying for the play-offs in Verano 1997 and Invierno 1997, the team did not accomplished any major results, and even had disastrous moments such as the embarrassing play-off series against Toros Neza in Verano 1997, which was lost in a 9‚Äì2 global score. ===The third \\"relegation\\" era=== Several issues occurred in Atlante's history during the last years of the 20th Century, those very issues that were going to define the team's future. Inexperienced head coaches (Zlatko Petricevic, Angel Cappa, Roberto Saporitti and Eduardo Rergis) arriving to the team, weak and vain players, and even a short decision in changing the main uniform's colours of red & blue to orange, made the team and its followers to feel without identity. Fans began switching into other successful teams, and Atlante's local matches began to feel desolated. Awful and boring matches, poorish skill level and players without a real commitment to the team, led Atlante to face again relegation issues to Segunda Divisi√≥n, now transformed into Primera Divisi√≥n A. Manuel Lapuente, who had recently succeeded with the National team at France 1998, had the responsibility to guide the team throughout the Verano 2001 tournament and save the team of an imminent relegation: at the end, Lapuente and his players did not accomplished the goal. However, a ray of light appeared, since the Mexican Federation was looking to expand the Primera Divisi√≥n with 2 new teams. After paying a 5 million dollar fee, Atlante was allowed to play a promotion-series' matches against the Primera A's runner-up, which turned out to be Veracruz. Atlante won the series 4‚Äì1, allowing them to remain at the top division as one of the new expansion teams. ===The rebirth of atlantismo=== A serious commitment has been taken since then by the directors' board. After breaking up its relationship with Televisa and Alejandro Burillo Azc√°rraga (owner of telecomm's company Pegaso) being the sole owner, the youth level program has been developed as the main philosophy, which has made Atlante the team with most youth debuts at Primera Divisi√≥n since 2000. First Carlos Reinoso, and then Miguel Herrera, both managed to build a new spirited team with its own personality, and with fabulous players such as popular Sebasti√°n \\"Chamagol\\" Gonz√°lez, Luis Gabriel Rey, and the emblematic goalie Federico Vilar, the team returned to the spotlight of the playoffs, arriving in three quarter-final and two semi-final stages. The team suffered a failed relocation to a different venue, this time to the Estadio Azulgrana Neza 86, and back again to Estadio Azteca. Former players (now head coaches) Ren√© Isidoro Garc√≠a and Jos√© Guadalupe Cruz struggled to maintain the spirit, strength, and skill of this Atlante's new era. The lack of assistants to their home matches remained as the major problem of the team, due Mexico City teams' lack of assistance to local matches, as well as both the irregular football level and the lack of identity for the team. ===The third crown at Quintana Roo=== On May 14, 2007, Atlante officially left the Estadio Azteca because its games there were not profitable. This was largely due to poor attendance at its home matches. They hoped that the move to Estadio Andr√©s Quintana Roo of Canc√∫n, Quintana Roo, would grow back its popularity and improve attendance. In a fantastic tournament, Atlante adapted quickly to its new venue and began winning important matches, either at home or visiting. Following a tough play-off against Cruz Azul and Guadalajara, Atlante faced Pumas UNAM for the title's final series. On December 9, 2007, only 5 months after arriving at its new venue, and after a great series of matches played by goalie Federico Vilar, as well as remarkable matches of Giancarlo Maldonado, Gabriel Pereyra, Javier Mu√±oz, Jos√© Joel \\"El Chicharo\\" Gonz√°lez and Clemente Ovalle (who scored the championship goal, 4 minutes before the end of the game), Atlante earned its third championship, growing back its popularity nationwide and especially at its new home city, Canc√∫n. Atlante won the Apertura 2007 Championship and by doing so, it qualified to the CONCACAF Champions' Cup 2008, where they were eliminated by Costa Rican Saprissa in the quarter-finals. By winning its title, Atlante qualified as well to the SuperLiga 2008, where they were eliminated by the New England Revolution at the semi-final stage. Atlante joined Santos Laguna, Cruz Azul, and Pumas UNAM at the CONCACAF Champions League in its inaugural season 2008‚Äì09, where they reached the final match against Cruz Azul. Atlante won the series 2‚Äì0, thus being crowned as CONCACAF Club Champion and earning the right to play at the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. ===The return to international spotlight=== Along with the FIFA Club World Championship, Atlante was invited to replace Celtic at the Peace Cup in Andalucia, Spain, where it faced M√°laga and Aston Villa. Atlante was soon eliminated with a single-goal difference against eventual champions Aston Villa. Atlante acquired Santiago Solari to reinforce the team. He was the last major figure since Hugo Sanchez's acquisition in 1995, and joined a select group of major international players to play for the club: Grzegorz Lato, Ruben \\"Rat√≥n\\" Ayala, Ricardo La Volpe, Cabinho, Miodrag Belodedici, Ilie Dumitrescu, and Faustino Asprilla. At the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup, Atlante defeated Auckland City 3‚Äì0 at the quarter-final stage. For its next stop at semifinals, it faced Barcelona in a curious match featuring two Mexicans with the same name, Rafael M√°rquez √Ålvarez of Barcelona and Rafael M√°rquez Lugo of Atlante, and two teams with the same jersey colors. FIFA eventually ruled out Barcelona to play with the blue-and-red stripes over Atlante. Atlante led the match at the fourth minute, but the final score was a 3‚Äì1 defeat. For the third-place match, Atlante was defeated by Pohang Steelers in a penalty shootout, missing two of their four shots, and finishing in fourth place. ==Shirt sponsors and manufacturers== {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" - !Period !Kit manufacturer !Shirt partner - 1988‚Äì89  Garcis  - 1989‚Äì90  Garcis  Toks - 1990‚Äì91  Garcis  - 1991‚Äì96  Garcis  Pe√±afiel - 1996‚Äì97  Garcis  DeWalt/Serfin/Herdez - 1997‚Äì98  Garcis  Pegaso/Serfin/Herdez - 1998‚Äì99  Garcis  Aerol√≠neas Internacionales/Pegaso/Herdez - 1999‚Äì00  Garcis  Pepsi/Pegaso/3 Hermanos - 2000‚Äì02  Garcis  Pegaso/Corona/Pe√±afiel - 2002‚Äì03  Garcis  Coca- Cola/Pegaso/Corona/PriceShoes - 2003‚Äì04  Garcis  Coca- Cola/Movistar/Corona/PriceShoes - 2004‚Äì05  Garcis  Pegaso/Coca-Cola/Corona - 2005‚Äì06  Garcis  Pegaso/Coca-Cola/Toyota/Corona - 2006‚Äì07  Garcis  Pegaso/Vavito/DuPont/Corona/AztraZ√©neca - 2007‚Äì08  Garcis  Pegaso/Garcis/ADO/SARE/Mexicana/Carrier/Meridian/Corona/Losec-A - 2008‚Äì09  Atletica  Pegaso/ADO/SARE/Canc√∫n/Mexicana/Corona/Coca-Cola - 2009‚Äì10  Garcis  Pegaso/Canc√∫n/Riviera Maya/Corona - 2010‚Äì11  Kelme  Pegaso/ADO/SARE/Canc√∫n/Riviera Maya/Corona - 2011‚Äì12  Garcis  Pegaso/ADO/OfficeMax/Canc√∫n/Riviera Maya/Volaris/Corona - 2013‚Äì  Kappa  Pegaso/ADO/Canc√∫n/Riviera Maya/Hard-Rock Hotel/Volaris/Corona/Coca-Cola } ==HonoursDomestic championships=== *Mexican Primera Divisi√≥n: 3 ::1946‚Äì47, 1992‚Äì93, Apertura 2007 ::Runner-up (4): 1945‚Äì46, 1949‚Äì50, 1950‚Äì51, 1981‚Äì82 *Ascenso MX: 0 ::Runner-up (1): Apertura 2015 *Segunda Divisi√≥n de M√©xico: 2 ::1976‚Äì77, 1990‚Äì91 *National Amateur League: 2 ::1931‚Äì32, 1940‚Äì41 *Copa M√©xico: 3 ::1941‚Äì42, 1950‚Äì51, 1951‚Äì52 ::Runner-up (5): 1943‚Äì44, 1945‚Äì46, 1948‚Äì49, 1962‚Äì63, Clausura 2013 *Campe√≥n de Campeones: 2 ::1941‚Äì42, 1951‚Äì52 ::Runner-up (2): 1946‚Äì47, 1950‚Äì51 ===International championships=== *CONCACAF Champions' Cup / CONCACAF Champions League: 2 ::1983, 2008‚Äì09 ::Runner-up (1): 1994 ==PersonnelCoaching staff=== {class=\\" - !

This article focuses on those phosphazenes with the formula RN=P(NR2)3. ==Phosphazene bases== Phosphazene bases are strong non-metallic non-ionic and low-nucleophilic bases. They are stronger bases than regular amine or amidine bases. Protonation takes place at a doubly bonded nitrogen atom. Related to phosphazene bases are the Verkade bases, which feature P(III) with three amido substituents and a transannular amine. The pKa's of [tert- Bu(H)N=P(N=PNR2)3)3]+ (R = Me, pyrrolide are 42.7 and 44, respectively. These are the highest pKa measured for the conjugate acid of charge-neutral molecular base.

From 4 May 2020, the Stop Funding Fake News campaign became a project of the CCDH. ==Deplatforming campaignsCampaign against Galloway and Hopkins=== Rachel Riley and the CCDH lobbied \\"big tech\\" companies to deplatform George Galloway and Katie Hopkins. The CCDH's first significant campaign began in January 2020; the targets for this campaign were Katie Hopkins, a right-wing commentator, and George Galloway, a veteran left- wing politician and broadcaster. The most prominent figure at the forefront of this was Rachel Riley, who directly lobbied \\"big tech\\" companies, along with the CCDH, to have these individuals removed from major social media platforms. Similar methods had already taken place in regards to American figures, such as conspiracy theorist Alex Jones in 2018, who was completely removed from all \\"big tech\\" platforms. According to media reports Riley and CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed had a \\"secret meeting\\" with Twitter's Soho, London based office, demanding the removal of Hopkins and Galloway from their platform. Riley, best known for co-hosting the game show Countdown, has an active Twitter account, coming to political prominence along with other UK-based celebrities such as David Baddiel, for advocacy in the debate over antisemitism in the UK Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn and claims to have been the victim of online trolling by pro-Palestinian left-wing Labour activists. Riley has herself courted controversy and accusations of online trolling by pro-Corbyn activists for content she has posted on Twitter. At the meeting with Twitter representatives on 29 January 2020, Ahmed and Riley stated that their demand was to exclude \\"hate actors from public discourse\\". Hopkins, who first came to public prominence in the United Kingdom as a contestant on The Apprentice and had gone on to have a career as a controversial media commentator, supports right-wing populism in general, including advocacy on her Twitter account for Brexit and American president Donald Trump. George Galloway, a veteran left- wing activist, broadcaster and former Labour MP, was sacked from his job at Talkradio for posting an allegedly antisemitic tweet. Ahmed and Riley presented to Twitter a number of posts by Hopkins and Galloway which they claimed were in breach of Twitter's community guidelines, demanding that they stop their \\"ability to use the platform to spread hate\\" and deplatform them from Twitter to eliminate \\"hate actors from public discourse\\". Ultimately, the CCHD's attempt to remove Galloway from Twitter failed, but Hopkins had her account suspended for a week in February 2020, and eventually removed permanently in July 2020. ===Campaign against David Icke=== The British conspiracy theorist David Icke, who the CCDH sought to deplatform in 2020. In April 2020 the CCDH started to campaign against the British conspiracy theorist David Icke, who gained media attention during the COVID-19-associated lockdown in the United Kingdom. Icke posted a number of controversial videos to his YouTube account, which included an interview with Brian Rose of London Real where Icke posited a conspiracy theory which attempted to link the erection of 5G masts to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the British lockdown, the CCDH began to present itself as \\"countering COVID-19 misinformation\\" and promoted various posts on its website and social media to this end attempting to direct public opinion on the subject. The CCDH released a 25-page pamphlet attacking Icke entitled \\"#DeplatformIcke\\" and began a campaign to enact social media deplatforming of him, using the hashtag \\"#DeplatformIcke\\". The CCDH demanded the total removal of Icke's online presence from \\"big tech\\" platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Instagram and Apple, portraying him as a \\"hate actor\\" on their website. The #DeplatformIcke pamphlet sent out by CCDH to \\"big tech\\" giants was signed by 800 individuals, according to the CCDH, and groups. in particular the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Antisemitism (Andrew Percy and Catherine McKinnell both signed), as did Damian Collins, Conservative MP who was the former chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. Antisemitism monitoring organisation, the Community Security Trust (CST), also supported the letter, with CST's Dave Rich calling for Icke's \\"hateful and dangerous conspiracy theories to be removed from mainstream social media platforms.\\" Icke, a prolific content creator, had a public audience of more than 1 million followers on YouTube, as well as on Facebook and Twitter. Two of the websites, YouTube and Facebook, deleted his accounts from their website: Facebook deleted his account on 1 May 2020, stating as the reason \\"health misinformation that could cause physical harm\\", YouTube followed on 2 May 2020 stating: \\"YouTube has clear policies prohibiting any content that disputes the existence and transmission of Covid-19 as described by the WHO and the NHS.\\" While both of Icke's personal accounts were deleted from the two websites, both allowed other uploaders to host Icke-related content unrelated to COVID-19. Ahmed and the CCDH praised the response to their call, but continued to demand that complete internet- wide deplatforming be enacted against Icke and a shadow ban of all his content be enforced. ==Directors and associates== Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate The organisation was founded by its current CEO, Imran Ahmed, who is also a trustee of Victim Support and sits on the steering committee for the Commission for Countering Extremism's Pilot Task Force. Ahmed previously co-authored the book The New Serfdom: The Triumph of Conservative Ideas and How to Defeat Them with Labour MP Angela Eagle and worked as a political advisor to Labour MP Hilary Benn. The CCDH has attracted a number of high-profile supporters such as Sadiq Khan (the Mayor of London), Rachel Riley, Gary Lineker and Eddie Izzard. According to their own website, the CCDH organisation has also been endorsed by other individuals and groups such as Nick Lowles of Hope not Hate, Fiyaz Mughal of Tell MAMA and Sara Khan of the Commission for Countering Extremism (set up by Theresa May in the aftermath of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing). Morgan James McSweeney (born April 1977) was the first Director of the group, originally known as Brixton Endeavours Limited. Since 2017, he had become the secretary of Labour Together. McSweeney resigned his position as CCDH Co-Director in April 2020 to focus on his work as the campaign manager for Keir Starmer's ultimately successful bid to become the new leader of the Labour Party. Aside from McSweeney, the organisation was joined by three other Co-Directors in September 2019. In addition to this are the currently sitting Co-Directors; Dr. Siobhan Marie McAndrew (born March 1978), a sociology lecturer for the School of Sociology, Politics and International Studies at the University of Bristol and Kirsty Jean McNeill (born February 1980), a Labour Party political activist and former speech writer for Gordon Brown who sits on the boards of the Labour Women's Network, the Holocaust Educational Trust (founded by Greville Janner) and the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust. ==Publications\\"Don't Feed the Trolls\\"=== The CCDH first garnered media attention by publishing a 12-page pamphlet \\"Don't Feed the Trolls: How to Deal with Hate on Social Media\\" in 2019, signed by the CCDH's CEO Imran Ahmed and the Canadian psychologist Linda Papadopoulos. The authors, Ahmed and Papadopoulos, acknowledged the assistance of the following individuals as having \\"provided valuable insight or feedback in the writing of this report\\"; Morgan McSweeney, Siobhan McAndrew, Rachel Riley, Dave Rich (of the Community Security Trust), Dr. Daniel Allington (of King's College London, Simon Clark (of the Center for American Progress), Euan Neill (of the Commission for Countering Extremism), Randeep Ramesh (of The Guardian), Hannah O'Rourke (of Labour Together), Will Somerville (of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington DC-based pro-immigration lobby group), Dr. Kate Ferguson (of Protection Approaches, an NGO which focuses on \\"identity-based violence and mass atrocity crimes\\"), Dr. Robert Ford (of the University of Manchester) and Jonathan Sebire (of Signify). The central thesis of the \\"Don't Feed the Trolls\\" pamphlet is that what the CCDH describes as internet trolls operate through manipulating social media algorithms and if a tweet or Facebook post receives engagement (whether positive or negative) then it is seen by a wider audience, particularly if the feedback is from a high-profile account. The pamphlet advises those who are on the receiving end of the messages not to respond, block the user, do not highlight being targeted and take time off social media. The pamphlet cited as ideological inspiration the works of several American-based sociologists, psychologists and political thinkers, including Cass Sunstein's Going to Extremes: How Like Minds Unite and Divide (2009) and On Rumors: How Falsehoods Spread, Why We Believe Them, What Can Be Done (2011), Jonathan Haidt's The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion (2012), George Lakoff's Don't Think of an Elephant! Know Your Values and Frame the Debate: The Essential Guide for Progressives (2004) and Nancy L. Rosenblum's A Lot of People Are Saying: The New Conspiricism and the Assault on Democracy (2019). ===\\"#DeplatformIcke\\"=== The CCDH published a report calling for social media platforms to remove the accounts of prominent British conspiracy theorist, David Icke in May 2020. The organisation entitled their 25-page pamphlet \\"#Deplatformicke: How Big Tech powers and profits from David Icke‚Äôs lies and hate, and why it must stop\\". The author of the report is not cited, although CEO, Imran Ahmed, wrote the introduction. Those listed as having provided advice for the report include academics, Daniel Allington, Robert Ford, Siobhan McAndrew and social media expert, Jonathan Sebire. The report and campaign were also supported by several prominent medics, including Christian Jessen and Adam Kay, as well as CCDH patron, Rachel Riley, Hope Not Hate and the Community Security Trust. ==Bibliography== *Don't Feed the Trolls: How to Deal with Hate on Social Media (2019) *#DeplatformIcke (2020) ==See also== * Internet censorship in the United Kingdom * Civil liberties in the United Kingdom * Stop Funding Fake News ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official website Category:2010s establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Companies based in the London Borough of Barnet ","title":"Center for Countering Digital Hate"},{"id":"7445940","text":"Gordon Glover \\"Slinger\\" Dunn (April 16, 1912 ‚Äì July 26, 1964) was an American discus thrower who won a silver medal at the 1936 Summer Olympics, a U.S. Navy lieutenant, and former mayor of Fresno, California from 1949-1957. Godron Dunn was born April 16, 1912 to William F. Dunn and Olive C. Glover in Portland, Oregon. Dunn's father, William F. Dunn once served as the deputy city clerk for Fresnohttps://www.newspapers.com/image/607248321. Shortly after Dunn was born, the family moved home to Fresno where the Dunn family had lived since the 1880s. Dunn's paternal grandfather, Thomas Dunn, was a pioneer resident of Fresno, a former councilmember, and potential mayoral candidatehttps://www.newspapers.com/image/607248321/. Dunn Avenue is named for his grandfather, Thomas Dunn. Dunn graduated from Fresno High School and attended Stanford University. Dunn's penchant for track and field and specifically discus throw allowed him to continue these sports through both high school and college. Earlier in 1934 he won the NCAA and IC4A titles.https://www.ancestrylibrary.com/imageviewer/collections/1265/images/31916_b033546-00298?treeid=&personid;=&usePUB;=true&_phsrc=yDP434&_phstart=successSource&pId;=999688931&backurl;=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ancestrylibrary.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fname%3DGordon_Dunn%26event%3D_Fresno- Fresno-California-USA_67954%26pg%3D3%26birth%3D1912 After college, Dunn remained in Menlo Park. ==1936 Berlin Olympics== Dunn participated in the discus competition for the United State Olympic Team at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany. Dunn qualified in second position behind fellow U.S. Olympian Ken Carpenter. In the Final round, Dunn threw for 49.36 meters (161 feet, 10 3/4 inches) earning him a Silver Medal. The 1936 Olympics would be Dunn's first and only appearance due to the next Olympic games not occurring again until 1948 Summer Olympics as a result of World War II. ==Military service== Dunn returned to Menlo Park where he divorced is first wife, Marjorie Kitselman in 1938. He married Naomi McCool shortly after the divorce and moved back to his birthplace of Portland where he took a job working as a merchandizing salesman for Associated Oil https://www.ancestrylibrary.com/imageviewer/collections/2442/images/m-t0627-03386-00667?pId=60141392&backurl;=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ancestrylibrary.com%2Ffamily- tree%2Fperson%2Ftree%2F168042422%2Fperson%2F162182303783%2Ffacts%3F_phsrc%3DyDP472%26_phstart%3DsuccessSource.

Dunn also outlawed street racing amongst firefightershttps://www.newspapers.com/image/25925769. For his zest in fighting crime and bringing order on city employees he qualified for the new nickname of \\"No-Fun Dunn.\\" He frequented going to fire and police meeting and events, and is known to have had both red lights and a siren installed on his personal vehicle. Gordon ran for a second term in 1953 and won with 65% of the vote. His second term would see a similar platforms as his first term including significant increases to the Fresno Police Department staff rosters and budgethttps://www.newspapers.com/image/25938210. Dunn ran in 1957 for a third term and lost to C. Cal Evans. In 1958 the city charter was approved and the mayoral office was to be voted on again. Dunn ran in 1958 again for a third term but came in third place behind Evans and Arthur L. Selland. ==Post-political career== Dunn left Fresno and moved to San Francisco, California where he resided until death. In 1964, Gordon Dunn was inducted into the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame..

The Vulcan laser is an infrared, 8-beam, petawatt neodymium glass laser at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's Central Laser Facility in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom. It was the facility's first operational laser. It is designed to deliver irradiance on target of 1021 W/cm2 for a wide-ranging experimental programme in fundamental physics and advanced applications. This includes the interaction of super high intensity light with matter, fast ignition fusion research, photon induced nuclear reactions, electron and ion acceleration by light waves, astrophysics in the laboratory and the exploration of the world of plasma dominated by relativity. In 2005 the Vulcan laser was the highest-intensity focussed laser in the world, certified by the Guinness Book of World Records, capable of producing a petawatt laser beam with a focused intensity of 1021 W/cm2.VULCAN in the Guinness Book of World Records for Second Year Running (CLF, Laser website) == Target Areas == There are currently two active target areas, Target Area Petawatt and Target Area West, Following the decommission of Target Area East. ===Target Area West=== Target Area West operates with dual short pulse beamlines delivering intensities of 1019 W/cm2 for pump-probe experiments using F3 focussing optics, other configurations are available.http://www.stfc.ac.uk/CLF/Facilities/Vulcan/Vulcan+Target+Areas/13886.aspx Six long pulse beams can be configured alongside the short pulses in multiple configurations, including single side cluster, cylindrical and spherical compression. The long pulse beams can be operated with pulse lengths from 0.5ns up to 8ns and energy from 50J to 300J per beam. Various pulse configurations can be set, including pre and post pulses. ===Target Area Petawatt=== Target Area Petawatt provides a single short pulse on target with a long pulse beamline, It is configured to deliver the highest intensity via a large parabolic mirror.http://www.stfc.ac.uk/CLF/Facilities/Vulcan/Vulcan+Target+Areas/13887.aspx As with Target Area West, various pulse configurations are possible. == Performance == Vulcan can deliver 500J on target in a compressed pulse of 500fs giving a peak irradiance of 1021 W/cm2 in a 5Œºm focal spot. This performance is not possible solely by Nd:glass amplifiers, since gain narrowing would reduce the pulse bandwidth below a limit required to support the pulse duration. * A novel front end amplification system based on Optical Parametric Chirped Pulse AmplificationEncyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology: https://www.rp-photonics.com/chirped_pulse_amplification.htmlD.

It was established in 1990 as an Advisory Council on Human Rights. Its founding law was amended in 2001 to be in conformity with the Paris Principles, and again in 2011, giving the institution more powers, more autonomy and broad prerogatives to protect and promote human rights in Morocco and also to promote the principles and values of democracy. A new fonding law passed in 2018, giving the institution even more powers and a broader mandate (Law #15.76). The Council was thus designated as a national preventive mechanism against torture, as a national disability rights mechanism and a national child redress mechanism. During its first general assembly in September 2019, the Council unveiled a new Tripple P strategy (for the prevention of violations, Protection of human rights, and Promotion of the culture of human rights). The National Human Rights Council of Morocco is accredited as an ‚ÄúA‚Äù status NHRI by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), i.e. in full compliance with the Paris Principles (the international standards adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1993 to frame the work of NHRIs and broadly accepted as the test of their legitimacy and credibility). It draws up annual reports on the situation of human rights and thematic or issue specific reports, monitors places of deprivation of liberty, handles complaints and investigates human rights violations, advises on the harmonization of national legislations with international human rights law, conducts surveys and issues advisory opinions and memoranda on human rights-related issues, etc. The Council has 12 regional human rights commissions, established with the aim to closely monitor the situation of human rights in the different regions of Morocco. These commissions can receive and handle complaints and investigate about human rights violations. They implement the programs and projects that the Council designs for the promotion of human rights, in cooperation with the local stakeholders. The National Human Rights Council is also mandated to promote the International Humanitarian Law. It contributes to training and raising awareness programs and develops cooperation partnerships with the International Committee of the Red Cross and all bodies concerned by the international humanitarian law.

On September 20, 1938, the section from Brownfield to 2.5 miles north of Lamesa was restored. On October 25, 1938, the section from 2.5 miles north of Lamesa to Lamesa was restored, and SH 137 was extended further south from Lamesa to Rankin. On September 26, 1939, the section from Brownfield to Lubbock been reassigned to U.S. Highway 62. SH 137 had extended south to west of Sheffield, replacing SH 271. On August 20, 1940, the section of SH 137 from Midland to the Midland/Upton County Line was cancelled, creating a gap. On October 22, 1940, the sections of SH 137 from Lamesa to Midland and from the Midland/Upton County Line to Rankin were also cancelled, expanding the gap. On December 3, 1940, the section of SH 137 from Lamesa to Rankin was restored, closing the gap. On March 26, 1942, the section from Lamesa to Rankin was cancelled, with the section from Midland south 12 miles being transferred to FM 9, creating a gap. On April 29, 1942, the sotuhern section of SH 137 from Rankin to Sheffield was transferred to SH 51, eliminating the gap. SH 137 was extended south to Stanton on August 23, 1943, replacing SH 303. On October 26, 1949, SH 137 was extended north from US 62 to SH 51. On December 1, 1953, SH 137 was signed, but not designated, along RM 1800 to SH 158. By 1969, SH 137 was signed along the rest of RM 1800, part of RM 33, and all of RM 865. On May 16, 1984, the route was officially designated along the signed extension, replacing all of RM 1800, part of RM 33, and all of RM 865. ==Junction listReferences== 137 Category:Transportation in Crockett County, Texas Category:Transportation in Reagan County, Texas Category:Transportation in Glasscock County, Texas Category:Transportation in Midland County, Texas Category:Transportation in Dawson County, Texas Category:Transportation in Terry County, Texas Category:Transportation in Martin County, Texas ","title":"Texas State Highway 137"},{"id":"7446172","text":"You Ought to Know may refer to: *You Ought to Know...

The Review, directed by Professor Robin Alexander , has been supported since its inception by grants from Esm√©e Fairbairn Foundation. The scope of the Review and the depth of its evidence have made it the most comprehensive enquiry into English primary education since the Plowden report of 1967. Between October 2007 and February 2009 the Review published 31 interim reports, including 28 surveys of published research, 39 briefings, 14 media releases and several newspaper articles. The Review's 608-page final report Children, their World, their Education: final report and recommendations of the Cambridge Primary Review Children, their World, their Education: final report and recommendations of the Cambridge Primary Review was published on 16 October 2009, together with an 850-page companion volume, The Cambridge Primary Review Research Surveys. Both books are published by Routledge. The Review's work has fallen into four distinct phases: January 2004 ‚Äì September 2006 : consultation and planning. October 2006 ‚Äì September 2009 : implementation and interim reporting. October 2009 ‚Äì September 2010 : publication, dissemination and discussion of the final report. October 2010 ‚Äì September 2012 : building on the CPR through professional networking and policy engagement. ==The Cambridge Primary Review National Network== Following the Review's dissemination phase, the Cambridge Primary Review National Network has been established to encourage and support the development of excellence in primary education. The network is guided by commitment to: equity, both social and educational empowerment of children and teachers expertise in childhood, pedagogy (learning, teaching, curriculum, assessment) and leadership excellence in learning and teaching. The Cambridge Primary Review National Network was led by Alison Peacock, headteacher at The Wroxham School, Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, from July 2010 until March 2013. The network operates a number of regional centres, based in higher education institutions around England. ==Remit== The Review's remit, as agreed between Esm√©e Fairbairn Foundation and the University of Cambridge in 2005-6, was as follows: 1.With respect to public provision in England, the Review will seek to identify the purposes which the primary phase of education should serve, the values which it should espouse, the curriculum and learning environment which it should provide, and the conditions which are necessary to ensure both that these are of the highest and most consistent quality possible, and that they address the needs of children and society over the coming decades. 2\\\\. The Review will pay close regard to national and international evidence from research, inspection and other sources on the character and adequacy of current provision in respect of the above, on the prospects for recent initiatives, and on other available options. It will seek the advice of expert advisers and witnesses, and it will invite submissions and take soundings from a wide range of interested agencies and individuals, both statutory and non- statutory. 3\\\\. The Review will publish both interim findings and a final report. The latter will combine evidence, analysis and conclusions together with recommendations for both national policy and the work of schools and other relevant agencies. ==Evidence== The Cambridge Primary Review had four main strands of evidence: Submissions Following the convention in enquiries of this kind, submissions were invited from all who wished to contribute. By March 2009, 1052 submissions had been received. They ranged from brief single- issue expressions of opinion to substantial documents of up to 300 pages covering several or all of the themes and comprising both detailed evidence and recommendations for the future. The majority of the submissions were from national organisations, but a significant number came from individuals. In addition, the Review received several thousand informal submissions and comments by email. Soundings This strand had three parts. The Community Soundings were a series of nine regionally based one- to two-day events, each comprising a sequence of meetings with representatives from schools and the communities they serve. The Community Soundings took place between January and March 2007, and entailed 87 witness sessions with groups of pupils, parents, governors, teachers, teaching assistants and heads, and with educational and community representatives from the areas in which the soundings took place. The National Soundings were more formal meetings in 2008-9 with national organisations both inside and outside education. These helped the team to clarify matters which were particularly problematic or contested, in preparation for the writing of the final report. In addition to the formal evidence-gathering procedures, the Review's director and other team members met representatives of many national and regional bodies for the exchange of information and ideas. By February 2009, 146 such meetings had taken place or were scheduled, in addition to the 94 community and national soundings, making a total of 240 sessions. Surveys Several months before the launch of the Review, 28 surveys of published research relating to the Review's ten themes were commissioned, on the basis of competitive bidding and peer review, from 66 academic consultants in leading university departments of education and allied fields. The resulting research reports and their accompanying briefings and media releases were published in cross-thematic groups over several months, starting between October 2007 and May 2008. They provoked considerable media, public and political interest, and provided the top UK news story on several occasions. The surveys were published by Routledge in October 2009 under the title, 'The Cambridge Primary Review Research Surveys' (edited by Robin Alexander). Searches and policy mapping With the co-operation of DfES/DCSF(now DfE), QCA (now QCDA), Ofsted, and TDA, the Review tracked recent policy and examined official data bearing on the primary phase. This provided the necessary legal, demographic, financial and statistical background to the Review and an important resource for its consideration of policy options. The Review also searched relevant OECD and other international data. The balance of evidence The four evidential strands sought to balance opinion-seeking with empirical data; non-interactive expressions of opinion with face-to-face discussion; official data with independent research; and material from England with that from other parts of the UK and from international sources. This enquiry, unlike some of its predecessors, looked outwards from primary schools to the wider society, and made full but judicious use of international data and ideas from other countries. ==Policy Priorities== The Review proposed the following as priorities for policymakers derived from the 75 recommendations with which the Cambridge Primary Review ºs final report ends (quoted with permission of the Cambridge Primary Review) . 1\\\\. Accelerate the drive to reduce England ºs gross and overlapping gaps in wealth, wellbeing and educational attainment, all of them far wider in England than most other developed countries. Understand that teachers can do only so much to close the attainment gap for as long as the lives of so many children are blighted by poverty and disadvantage. Excellence requires equity. 2\\\\. Make children ºs agency and rights a reality in policy, schools and classrooms. Apply the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in ways which reinforce what we now know about how children most effectively learn, but do so with common sense and an understanding of context so that  ªpupil voice º does not degenerate into tokenism or fad. 3\\\\. Consolidate the Early Years Foundation Stage, extending it to age six so as to give young children the best possible foundation for oracy, literacy, numeracy, the wider curriculum and lifelong learning. And if there is still any doubt about what the CPR said on this matter, let it be understood that this is about the character of the early years and early primary curriculum, not the school starting age. 4\\\\. Address the perennially neglected question of what primary education is for. The Mrs Beeton approach ‚Äì first catch your curriculum, then liberally garnish with aims ‚Äì is not the way to proceed. Aims must be grounded in a clear framework of values ‚Äì for education is at heart a moral matter ‚Äì and in properly argued positions on childhood, society, the wider world and the nature and advancement of knowledge and understanding. And aims should shape curriculum, pedagogy, assessment and the wider life of the school, not be added as mere decoration. 5\\\\. Replace curriculum tinkering by genuine curriculum reform. Seize the opportunity presented by the dropping of the primary curriculum clauses from the Children, Schools and Families Bill and the launch of the new national curriculum review in January 2011. Understand that the Rose review ºs narrow remit prevented it from addressing some of the problems of the primary curriculum which are most in need of attention, especially the counterproductive sacrificing of curriculum entitlement to a needlessly restricted notion of  ªstandards º, the corrosive split between the  ªbasics º and the rest, the muddled posturing on subjects, knowledge and skills, and the vital matter of the relationship between curriculum quality, expertise and staffing; and that the curriculum debate therefore remains wide open. But don ºt think that the minimalism of the 1950s (or 1870s) is an adequate alternative. Look instead at the Cambridge model: an aims-driven entitlement curriculum of breadth, richness and contemporary relevance, which secures the basics and much more besides, and combines a national framework with a strong local component. 6\\\\. Abandon the dogma that there is no alternative to SATs. Stop treating testing and assessment as synonymous. Stop making Year 6 tests bear the triple burden of assessing pupils, evaluating schools and monitoring national performance. Abandon the naive belief that testing of itself drives up standards. It doesn't: good teaching does. Initiate wholesale assessment reform drawing on the wealth of alternative models now available, so that we can at last have systems of formative and summative assessment ‚Äì in which tests certainly have a place ‚Äì which do their jobs validly, reliably and without causing collateral damage. Adopt the CPR ºs definition of standards as excellence in all domains of the curriculum to which children are statutorily entitled, not just the 3Rs. And understand that those who argue for reform are every bit as committed to rigorous assessment and accountability as those who pin everything on the current tests. The issue is not whether children should be assessed or schools should be accountable ‚Äì they should ‚Äì but how and in relation to what. 7\\\\. Replace the pedagogy of official recipe by pedagogies of repertoire, evidence and principle. Recognise that this is no soft option, for in place of mere compliance with what others expect we want teachers to be accountable to evidence so that they can justify the decisions they take. Note that the CPR ºs evaluation of over 4000 published sources shows how far that evidence differs from some versions of  ªbest practice º which teachers are currently required to adopt. As the Cambridge report says:  ªChildren will not learn to think for themselves if their teachers are expected merely to do as they are told. º 8\\\\. Replace the government ºs professional standards for teachers, which have limited evidential provenance, by a framework validated by research about how teachers develop as they progress from novice to expert. Retain guidance and support for those who need it, but liberate the nation ºs most talented teachers ‚Äì and hence the learning of their pupils ‚Äì from banal and bureaucratic prescriptions. Balance the need to give new teachers the necessary knowledge, skill and confidence for their first appointment with the vital ingredient that teacher educators have been forced to drop: critical engagement with the larger questions of educational context, content and purpose. 9\\\\. Grasp at last the primary school staffing nettle. Recognise that the generalist class teacher system inherited from the nineteenth century confers undoubted educational benefits, but that in terms of the range and depth of knowledge required by a modern curriculum it may demand more than many teachers can give. Initiate a full review of primary school staffing, assessing expertise, roles and numbers against the tasks which primary schools are required to undertake. Consider more flexible ways of staffing primary schools using a mix of generalists, semi-specialists and specialists, and exploit opportunities for professional partnerships and exchanges, especially for small schools. Reassess, too, the balance of teachers, teaching assistants and other support staff. Give head teachers time and support to do the job for which they are most needed: leading learning and assuring quality. 10\\\\. Help schools to work in partnership with each other and with their communities rather than in competition, sharing ideas, expertise and resources ‚Äì including across the primary/secondary divide ‚Äì and together identifying local educational needs and opportunities. End the league table rat race and ‚Äì since Finland is the country whose educational standards policy-makers seek to match ‚Äì note Finland ºs paramount commitment to social and educational equity through a genuinely comprehensive school system of consistently high quality. 11\\\\. Re- balance the relationship between government, national agencies, local authorities and schools. Reverse the centralising thrust of recent policy. End government micro-management of teaching. Require national agencies and local authorities to be independent advisers rather than political cheerleaders or enforcers, and to argue their cases with due rigour. Re-invigorate parental and community engagement in schools and the curriculum. Abandon myth, spin and the selective use of evidence. Restore the checks and balances which are so vital to the formulation of sound policy. Exploit the unrivalled compendium of evidence and ideas which the Cambridge Review has provided on this and the other matters above. ==References== Alexander, R.

Its monitoring criteria includes optimal operation of antivirus software, personal firewall, as well as the working status of Backup and Restore, Network Access Protection (NAP), User Account Control (UAC), Windows Error Reporting (WER), and Windows Update. It notifies the user of any problem with the monitored criteria, such as when an antivirus program is not up-to-date or is offline. ==Operation== Security and Maintenance consists of three major components: A control panel applet, a Windows service and an application programming interface (API) provided by Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). The control panel applet divides the monitored criteria into categories and color-codes them. Yellow indicates a non-critical warning, e.g. some settings are not being monitored or are not optimal. Red indicates a critical message, e.g. anti-virus program is offline. A service, named \\"Security Center\\", determines the current state of the settings. The service, by default, starts when the computer starts; it continually monitors the system for changes, and notifies the user if it detects a problem. In versions of Windows prior to Windows 10, it adds a notification icon into the Windows Taskbar. A WMI provider makes the settings available to the system. Third-party anti-virus, anti-spyware and personal firewall software vendors primarily register with Security and Maintenance through the WMI provider. Windows Vista added a new set of APIs that let programs retrieve the aggregate health status within Security and Maintenance, and to receive notifications when the health status changes. These APIs allow programs to confirm that the system is in a healthy state before engaging in certain actions. For example, a computer game can ensure that a firewall is running before connecting to an online game. Security and Maintenance is charge of the following: * Querying the status of the personal firewall and turning it on * Querying the status of the anti-malware program, turning it on and instructing it to update itself * Querying the status of the Internet security settings and asking the user to change them if they are not optimal * Querying the status of the User Account Control settings and asking the user to change it if it is not optimal * Scheduling and executing automatic maintenance tasks, which includes a quick scan for malware, disk defragmentation, power efficiency diagnostics * Querying the status of Backup and Restore and prompting the user to schedule a backup if one is not in place (Windows 7 only) * Querying the status of File History; however, the user is not alerted about it (Windows 8 and later only) * Querying the status of HomeGroup; no alerts are issued about it * Managing problems logged by Windows Error Reporting: The user can see their details, send them to Microsoft if they are not automatically sent, query a solution for them (although most of the times, there is none) or selectively delete them. ==Version historyWindows XP SP2=== Microsoft learned from discussions with customers that there was confusion as to whether users were taking appropriate steps to protect their systems, or if the steps they were taking were effective. From this research, Microsoft made the decision to include a visible control panel with Windows XP Service Pack 2 that would provide a consolidated view of the most important security features. Service Pack 2, released in August 2004, includes the first version of Windows Security Center (WSC). This version monitors Windows Update, Windows Firewall, and the availability of an anti- virus program. Third-party providers of personal firewall and anti-virus software packages were encouraged to use WSC API to register their products with WSC. On 25 August 2004, PC Magazine published an article in their Security Watch newsletter titled \\"Windows XP SP2 Security Center Spoofing Threat\\" which outlined a design vulnerability which could allow malware to manipulate Security Center into displaying a false security status regardless of the true security status. To do so, the malware requires administrative privileges. Microsoft countered their claim by asserting that if a piece of malware gains administrative privileges, it need not spoof anything, as it can commit much nastier malicious actions. ===Windows Vista=== WSC in Windows Vista monitors new criteria, such as anti-spyware software, User Account Control, and Internet Explorer security settings. It can also display logos of third-party products that have been registered with the Security Center. Unlike Windows XP, in the beta versions of Windows Vista, WSC could not be disabled or overridden. Security software maker Symantec spoke out against this, noting that it would cause a great deal of consumer confusion because any security problems would be reported by both WSC and Symantec's tools at the same time. McAfee, another large security software vendor, lodged similar complaints. In the end, Microsoft allowed WSC to be disabled. ===Windows 7=== In Windows 7, Windows Security Center has been renamed Action Center. It was designed to centralize and reduce the number of notifications about the system; as such, it encompasses both security and maintenance of the computer. Its notification icon on Windows Taskbar only appears when there is a message for perusal and replaces five separate notification icons found in Windows Vista. A \\"Troubleshooting\\" link was also added, providing a shortcut to Windows 7's new Troubleshooting control panel. ===Windows 8=== In Windows 8, Action Center monitors 10 new items: Microsoft account, Windows activation, SmartScreen, automatic maintenance, drive status, device software, startup apps, HomeGroup, File History, and Storage Spaces. ===Windows 10=== alt= In Windows 10, the name \\"Action Center\\" is now used for application notifications and quick actions. The Action Center from Windows 8.1 was renamed to Security and Maintenance, causing confusion for users and IT administrators. It no longer displays an icon in the notification area, but otherwise retains all the features of the Windows 8.1 Action Center. The \\"Troubleshooting\\" link was removed in Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. Starting with Windows 10 Creators Update, Microsoft has introduced a new component called Windows Defender Security Center (WDSC) that provides much of the same functionality. This new component is a Universal Windows Platform app and is also the default front- end for Windows Defender. It relies on its own service, called \\"Windows Defender Security Center Service\\". In comparison to Security and Maintenance, WDSC: * Monitors six categories: antivirus software, Windows Update, storage capacity, device drivers, Windows Firewall and SmartScreen * Has its own distinct icon in the notification area * Can fully control Windows Defender * Does not regard other personal firewall: In Windows 10 version 1703, if Windows Firewall is disabled, it raises a false alarm, claiming the system is not protected. In Windows 10 version 1709, the false alarm is not raised but WDSC does not provide meaningful monitoring of third-party firewalls the way Security and Maintenance does.In Windows 10 version 1809, Windows Defender Security Center was renamed as Windows Security. ==See also== * List of Microsoft Windows components * Microsoft Security Essentials ==References * MSDN: Windows Security Center API Category:Microsoft Windows security technology Category:Windows administration Category:Windows Vista Category:Windows XP Category:Windows components ","title":"Security and Maintenance"},{"id":"7446332","text":"Adobe LiveCycle Enterprise Suite (ES4) is a service-oriented architecture Java EE server software product from Adobe Systems used to build applications that automate a broad range of business processes for enterprises and government agencies.

The solutions can also increase organizational compliance, consistency, visibility, and control with templates, pre-approved content blocks, audit trails, and advanced archive searching. ===LiveCycle ES4 ECM connectors=== LiveCycle ES4 Connectors for ECM integrates other ECMs (enterprise content management systems) with LiveCycle for design time asset management and runtime process management. At design time, users can manage assets for the application including forms, fragments, images, and other content assets in the ECM system. Developers can then access those assets directly within LiveCycle Workbench ES4 for the creation of forms, documents, and packages. The connectors also enable business processes to retrieve content objects, as well as their content attributes or metadata directly from the ECM system. Specific ECM systems supported by these connectors include IBM Content Manager, IBM/FileNet content repository, Microsoft SharePoint, and EMC/Documentum's document repository. LiveCycle also provides native support for connecting to Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), its web content management (WCM) system. ==LiveCycle ES4 tooling productsLiveCycle Workbench ES4=== The primary development tool to create LiveCycle applications is LiveCycle Workbench. This is an Eclipse-based development environment which allows developers to create form templates and process designs that can be integrated with a variety of data sources and existing applications. It includes an integrated repository for collaborative development, and simplifies deployment via an archive file which contains all of the assets associated to the application. The process design environment enables drag and drop of process services to create process workflows and also provides the ability for developers to save them as single WSDL-based components for others developers to use. ===LiveCycle Designer ES4=== Form authors and developers use LiveCycle Designer to build templates that merge with enterprise data to deliver interactive forms or personalized documents in a wide variety of electronic or print formats. LiveCycle Designer ES4 is included in every LiveCycle ES4 installation and embedded within LiveCycle Workbench ES4. Adobe Flash Builder integrates with the LiveCycle ES4 environment. Using Flex Builder developers can create RIAs and create custom additions to forms created in LiveCycle Designer. ==Implications for Document Management Systems== PDF documents restricted with LiveCycle DRM are sometimes impossible to use in non-Adobe document management systems because LiveCycle can prevent third-party software from disassembling the PDF, extracting pages, and displaying the contents. In these cases, if LiveCycle does not also prevent printing, users may resort to printing PDF documents from compatible Adobe software and scanning the printouts into unrestricted, rasterized PDF's that are usable in third-party software. For example, a university admissions department may be unable to load an electronic transcript received from the National Student Clearinghouse, which allows client schools to restrict e-transcripts with Adobe LiveCycle, into admissions CRM software. ==References== Category:Adobe software Category:Service-oriented architecture- related products ","title":"Adobe LiveCycle"},{"id":"7446336","text":"Wordsworth McAndrew (22 November 1936 ‚Äì 25 April 2008)Gary Girdhari, \\"The Passing of a Great Artist: Wordsworth McAndrew\\", Guyana Journal, May 2008. was a leading Guyana folklorist, poet, radio broadcaster, and creative artist. ==Biography== McAndrew was born in 22 November 1936 in Georgetown, British Guiana, to Winslow Alexander McAndrew and Ivy McAndrew.

Later in her career, she had a resurgence with the disco hit \\"Shame, Shame, Shame\\" in the 1970s. ==Career== Goodman was born in New Orleans. After singing in church choirs, she recorded her first demo with a group of friends in 1950. Some months later, her solo voice caught the attention of Aladdin Records owner Eddie Messner, who tracked her down and paired her as a duo with another school friend, Leonard Lee (June 29, 1935 ‚Äì October 23, 1976). As 'Shirley & Lee', they recorded their debut single \\"I‚Äôm Gone\\", produced by Cosimo Matassa, which reached #2 on the Billboard R&B; charts in 1952. The record contrasted Goodman‚Äôs soprano with Leonard's baritone, in a way in which subsequent songwriters have suggested was influential on the development of ska and reggae. In their early songs, they pretended as if they were sweethearts and were dubbed \\"the Sweethearts of the Blues\\". However, they changed style in 1956 and recorded \\"Let the Good Times Roll\\", which became their biggest hit single reaching #1 on the US R&B; chart and #20 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Although a follow-up single, \\"I Feel Good\\" (not to be confused with their 1955 single \\"Feel So Good\\"), also made the charts, the duo‚Äôs later releases were less successful, and the pair moved to the Warwick label in 1959.Obituary, Juke Blues no. 59, 2005, p. 68. Goodman and Leonard split up in 1963. Leonard made some subsequent solo records with little success. In the mid 1960s, Goodman moved to California, where she worked as a session singer on records by Sonny and Cher, Dr. John and others, and also formed a duo for a time with Jessie Hill. She sang backing vocals on The Rolling Stones‚Äô Exile On Main Street album, but then briefly retired from the music industry. On October 15, 1971, Shirley & Lee were reunited for one show only at the Madison Square Garden in New York City. The playbill included musicians of the early rock era, including Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, and Bobby Rydell.Shirley & Lee. Liner Notes. The Imperial Sides 1962/1963. Imperial Records, 1986.

Later in 1974, as Shirley Goodman Pixley, she was contacted by her friend Sylvia Robinson, previously of the duo Mickey and Sylvia and now co-owner of the All Platinum record label, and was persuaded to record the lead vocal on a dance track, \\"Shame, Shame, Shame\\". Credited to Shirley & Company, the record became an international pop hit, reaching #12 on the Billboard chart and presaging the disco boom. On May 17, 1974, Shirley & Lee reunited once again to perform \\"Let the Good Times Roll\\" on a special \\"oldies\\" edition of the NBC musical series The Midnight Special. After a few further recordings and tours, Goodman finally retired from the music industry after returning to New Orleans in the late 1970s. ==Post career== After suffering a stroke in 1994, she moved to California, and died on July 5, 2005, in Los Angeles.

As of 2012, the branch has served 74,651 passengers every weekday. The Loop is so named because the elevated tracks loop around a rectangle formed by Lake Street (north side), Wabash Avenue (east), Van Buren Street (south), and Wells Street (west). The railway loop has given its name to Chicago's downtown, which is also known as the Loop. Transit began to appear in Chicago in the latter half of the 19th century as the city grew rapidly, and rapid transit started to be built the late 1880s. When the first rapid transit lines opened in the 1890s, they were independently owned and each had terminals that were located immediately outside of Chicago's downtown, where it was considered too expensive and politically inexpedient to build rapid transit. Charles Tyson Yerkes aggregated the competing rapid transit lines and built a loop connecting them, which was constructed and opened in piecemeal fashion between 1895 and 1897, finally completing its last connection in 1900. Upon its completion ridership on the Loop was incredibly high, such that the lines that had closed their terminals outside of downtown had to reopen them to accommodate the surplus rush-hour traffic. In the latter half of the 20th century, ridership declined and the Loop was threatened with demolition in the 1970s. However, interest in historic preservation occurred in the 1980s, and ridership has stabilized since. ==Operations== The Loop includes eight stations: Clark/Lake and State/Lake are on the northern leg; Washington/Wabash and Adams/Wabash are on the eastern side; Harold Washington Library - State/Van Buren and LaSalle/Van Buren are on the southern leg; and Quincy and Washington/Wells are on the western side. In 2011 20,896,612 passengers entered the 'L' via these stations. Two towers control entry to and exit from the Loop. Tower 12 stands at the southeastern corner. Tower 18 stands watch over the three-quarter union located at the northwestern corner, which at one time was billed as the busiest railroad interlocking in the world. The current Tower 18 was placed into service on May 19, 2010, replacing the former tower on that site that was built in 1969. Five of the eight 'L' lines use the Loop tracks: *The Brown Line enters at Tower 18 on the northwest corner, supplemented by the Purple Line at rush hours. The Purple Line makes a full circuit clockwise around the Inner Loop, while the Brown Line makes a full circuit counterclockwise around the Outer Loop. Following the completion of a full circuit back to Tower 18, trains of these two lines return to their points of origin. *The Orange Line enters at Tower 12 on the southeast corner, and the Pink Line enters at Tower 18 on the northwest corner; both traveling clockwise around the Inner Loop before returning to their points of origin. *The Green Line is the only line to use Loop trackage but not terminate on it. Its trains run in both directions along the Lake and Wabash sides from Tower 18 to Tower 12, connecting the Lake Street branch and the South Side Elevated. Both of the 'L' lines with 24 hour service, the Blue Line and the Red Line, run in subways through the center of the Loop, and have both in-system and out-of-system transfers to Loop stations. The Yellow Line is the only 'L' line that does not run on or connect to the Loop. ==HistoryHistory of transit in Chicago=== When it was incorporated as a city in 1837, Chicago was dense and walkable, so there was no need for a transit system. Things began to change as Chicago grew rapidly in the 19th century. ===Rapid transit and the \\"L\\"=== Prior to construction of the Union Loop, Chicago's three elevated railway lines‚Äîthe South Side Elevated Railroad, the Lake Street Elevated Railroad, and the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad‚Äîeach had their own terminal on the edges of downtown Chicago. Charles Tyson Yerkes masterminded the linking of these railroads. ===Construction of the Loop=== The Union Elevated Railroad Company was incorporated November 1894 for the purpose of constructing a loop in the heat of the city's business district. With tense opposition from owners of abutting properties, extensive litigation ensued during the course of receiving approval to build the loop. Between January 8, 1894 and June 29, 1896 a series of ordinances were passed by the Chicago City Council enabling the construction of the Union Loop's route. The Union Loop was constructed in separate sections: the Lake Street 'L' was extended along the north side in 1895; the Union Elevated Railroad opened the east side along Wabash Avenue in 1896 and the west side along Wells Street in 1897; and the Union Consolidated Elevated Railroad opened the south side along Van Buren Street in 1897. The Loop opened on September 6, 1897. The Loop was born in political scandal: upon completion, all the rail lines running downtown had to pay Yerkes's operation a fee, which raised fares for commuters; when Yerkes, after bribery of the state legislature, secured legislation by which he claimed a fifty-year franchise, the resulting furor drove him out of town and ushered in a short-lived era of \\"Progressive Reform\\" in Chicago.Paul Barrett. \\"Chicago's Public Transportation Policy, 1900‚Äì1940s\\", 8 Ill. Hist. Teacher 25 (Illinois Historical preservation Agency, 2001). Originally there were 12 stations, with three stations on each side. The construction of the west-leg of the Union Loop over Wells Street required the removal of the southern platform of the Fifth/Lake station. The addition of the Northwestern Elevated Railroad caused the removal of the rest of the station as the remaining platform sat across the new road's entry point. This left 11 stations, two on the north leg of the loop and three on each other leg. ==Station listing== Chicago Transit Authority Chicago 'L' route map This lists each station beginning at the northwest corner and moving counterclockwise around the loop: south along Wells Street, east along Van Buren Street, north along Wabash Avenue, and west along Lake Street. { border=1 align=center class= - !Station !Location !Points of interest & Notes - style=\\"background-color: #bbb\\"  150 N.

While attending Joseph Clark High School, they recorded a demo for \\"I'm Gone,\\" a song Lee wrote, at Cosimo Matassa's studio in New Orleans. Eddie Mesner, the owner of Aladdin Records, heard the demo and asked Mesner to locate Goodman. Initially her religious grandmother was hesitant for her to record R&B; and blues music, but after he offered her $1,000 she allowed Goodman to sign with Aladdin. Goodman and Lee re-recorded the song with producer Dave Bartholomew. Released in late 1952, their debut single reached No. 2 on the Billboard's R&B; National Best Sellers chart in January 1953. Although Shirley & Lee were never a couple, the duo became known as \\"the Sweethearts of the Blues\\" due to the romantic sagas their songs. Leaning on the contrast of Lee's deep voice and Goodman's higher voice, they recorded songs that conveyed a love affair. \\"Shirley's Back\\" was the second sequel to \\"I'm Gone\\", after \\"Shirley, Come Back To Me\\". As reviewed in Billboard (June 20, 1953): \\"The cycle's completed. First she left; then Lee pleaded for her return; finally she's back and happiness reigns.\\" Still just teenagers when they found success, Goodman's grandmother chaperoned her while they toured with Big Mama Thorton as her opening act. Nightclubs often stopped serving alcohol when they performed due to their age. They reached No. 2 on the R&B; chart with \\"Feel So Good\\" in 1955. Their biggest hit \\"Let the Good Times Roll\\" topped the R&B; chart in 1956 and peaked at No. 20 on the Pop chart. Their debut album, Let the Good Times Roll, was released that same year. In 1959, Shirley & Lee moved to Warwick Records, where they ended up re-recording \\"Let the Good Times Roll.\\" The duo were never able to duplicate the success of their biggest hit. They released their second album titled Let The Good Times Roll on Warwick in 1961. They recorded for Imperial Records before they spit up in 1963. Nearly a decade later, they reunited for some concerts in 1972. Goodman returned to the charts in 1974 with her disco hit \\"Shame, Shame, Shame.\\" She retired from the music industry in the late 1970s. After suffering a stroke in 1994, Goodman moved to California, and died on July 5, 2005, in Los Angeles.

One day she wakes up to discover thick, solid-colored stripes all over her body. The Family's physician, Dr. Bumble determines that Camilla is well enough to attend school. But when she does, most of the other children tease her and some of the other children call out colors and patterns which cause the colors on her skin to shift around. The school teachers worry that her condition may be contagious, so the principal sends her home. At home, Camilla goes through a number of increasingly preposterous metamorphoses such as turning into a pill after being given one, having viruses, bacteria, and fungus colonies grow on her body after the community's expert scientists discuss these as a possible cause while examining her, growing roots, berries, crystals, feathers, and a long furry tail after receiving different medicine. Finally, she melts and merges into her room after an environmental therapist tells her to ‚Äúbecome one with the room‚Äù. Finally, an old lady persuades her to eat some lima beans. Camilla is afraid to admit her willingness to eat them at first, but after realizing that this could be her only hope of being cured, she allows the old woman to feed her them. Camilla is successfully reverted to a human and continues to eat lima beans; although her friends consider her strange for liking them (and for her bow being covered in stripes), she doesn't even care a bit. She enjoys being different and never has stripes again. ==Themes== A Bad Case of Stripes discusses ethics and metaphysics, by highlighting self-perception, identity, peer pressure, and bullying. ==Reception== Kirkus Reviews found that \\"Shannon's story is a good poke in the eye of conformity--imaginative, vibrant, and at times good and spooky--and his emphatic, vivid artwork keeps perfect pace with the tale.\\" Another review said \\"This imaginative storyline expresses interesting aspects of peer pressure and self-esteem.\\" and \\"Shannon's colored illustrations are vibrant and animated, and they show a particular talent for vividly portraying facial expressions.\\" A 2004 study found that it was a common read-aloud book for fourth-graders in schools in San Diego County, California while based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its \\"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children.\\" It also received the 1999 Montana Treasure State Picture Book Award. ==References== Category:1998 children's books Category:American picture books Category:Fictional diseases and disorders ","title":"A Bad Case of Stripes"},{"id":"7446624","text":"Braniff International Airways Flight 352 was a scheduled domestic flight from William P. Hobby Airport in Houston, Texas, United States, to Dallas Love Field in Dallas; on May 3, 1968, a Lockheed L-188A Electra flying on the route, registration N9707C, broke up in midair and crashed near Dawson, Texas, after flying into a severe thunderstorm. It was carrying 5 crew and 80 passengers; there were no survivors. Among those killed was Texas state representative Joseph Lockridge, the first black man to represent Dallas County in the Texas Legislature. Investigation revealed that the accident was caused by the captain's decision to penetrate an area of heavy weather followed by a structural over-stress and failure of the airframe while attempting recovery from loss of control during a steep 180-degree turn executed in an attempt to escape the weather.. Retrieved on 2006-10-14. ==Flight history== Earlier in the day, at 12:40 local time, the crew of the accident flight flew from Dallas to Houston through the same area they were scheduled to fly later on. On that previous flight, a few hours before, they encountered no significant weather along the route. Once they arrived in Houston, there was no record of the crew being briefed about the updated weather by any Weather Bureau or Federal Aviation Administration personnel, or by any Braniff dispatcher or weather office. They did, however, receive hardcopy information about all relevant en route and terminal weather reports and forecasts. At 16:11, the crew departed William P. Hobby Airport as Braniff Flight 352, a Lockheed L-188A Electra four-engine turboprop, en route to Dallas Love Field. After about 25 minutes into the flight, while cruising at FL200 (about 20,000 feet above mean sea level), the aircraft approached an area of severe thunderstorm activity. The crew requested to descend to 15,000 feet and deviate to the west. Air Traffic Control (ATC) informed the crew that other flights in the area were deviating to the east and suggested they also deviate east, but the Electra crew insistedFinding #15 in the NTSB report that the west seemed OK to them on their onboard weather radar: \\"Three fifty two does it look good (better). On our scope here it looks like to the uh a little just a little bit to the west would do us real fine.\\" ATC then cleared the flight to descend to 14,000 feet and deviate to the west as they requested. (The westerly deviation would have been shorter and quicker than an easterly one.Finding #26 in the NTSB report) At 16:44 the crew requested and ATC cleared the flight to descend to 5,000 feet. The crew asked ATC if there were any reports of hail in the area, to which ATC replied: \\"No, you're the closest one that's ever come to it yet ... I haven't been able to, anybody to, well I haven't tried really to get anybody to go through it, they've all deviated around to the east.\\" At 16:47 the flight encountered an area of severe weather including hail and requested a 180-degree right turn, which ATC immediately approved. While turning to the right in severe turbulence, the bank angle was increased to over 90 degrees, and the nose pitched down to approximately 40 degrees. As the crew attempted to recover from the ensuing steep diving turn, the aircraft experienced acceleration forces of over 4 g, which caused the right wing to fail. The aircraft then broke up at an altitude of 6,750 feet and crashed in flames into the ground at about 16:48, killing all 85 persons on board. Witnesses said the four-engine turboprop Electra ‚Äî a modified version of the trouble-plagued Lockheed aircraft that had experienced two wing failure accidents in 1959 and 1960 ‚Äî had blown up before it hit the ground and pieces \\"fishtailed\\" down through sheets of rain. The FBI, however, did not suspect foul play. Cloyce Floyd, postmaster of the little town of Dawson, about a mile from the crash scene, said he was driving along in the rain when he saw an \\"orange flash.\\" He continued, \\"I looked over to the left and I could see this red ball of fire hanging back there about the size of the sun. From the glare of the fire I could see the fuselage sort of fishtailing down. Then it hit and exploded.\\" Rex Owen, a fireman from Mexia, Texas, was among nearly 100 volunteer rescue workers who went to the scene. \\"The wreckage was scattered all over the place,\\" he said. Rescue worked clogged the muddy roads for hours carrying bodies and parts of bodies from the eerie scene lit by several Klieg lights.\\"New York Times\\", May 4, 1968 ==Investigation== The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the accident. The flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were recovered from the wreckage with their data mostly intact, and the cockpit audio was reconstructed and transcribed. The NTSB correlated the cockpit conversations with the ATC communications transcript and noted that it was the first officer, at the captain's request, who asked ATC if they had received reports of hail in the area and received the response from ATC that they hadn't because other aircraft had \\"all deviated around to the east.\\" At that point, according to the CVR transcript, the captain advised the first officer: \\"No, don't talk to him too much. I'm hearing his conversation on this. He's trying to get us to admit (we're makin)Other possible interpretations for the parenthesized words which were garbled in the audio: \\"we'd made the\\" or \\"we made a\\" big mistake coming through here.\\" Shortly thereafter, the first officer stated: \\"... it looks worse to me over there.\\" The crew then requested and received clearance from ATC for the 180-degree turn. The turn became extremely steep, with a bank of over 90 degrees and a nose pitch-down of 40 degrees. As they were trying to recover from the turn, the FDR indicated a peak acceleration of 4.3 g, which the NTSB concluded caused a structural overstress and inflight breakup. On June 19, 1969, the NTSB issued its final report, which included the following probable cause statement: \\"Probable Cause: The stressing of the aircraft structure beyond its ultimate strength during an attempted recovery from an unusual attitude induced by turbulence associated with a thunderstorm. The operation in the turbulence resulted from a decision to penetrate an area of known severe weather.\\" ==See also== * List of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft ==References * Airliners.net Photos of Electra N9707C, in Dallas Love Field * Corsicana Daily Sun \\"Dawson Plane Crash Remembered\\" * 84 Die in Worst Texas Air Disaster May 1968 * Passenger List of Flight 352 352 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 1968 Category:1968 in Texas Category:Airliner accidents and incidents in Texas Category:Disasters in Texas Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Lockheed L-188 Electra Category:Navarro County, Texas Category:Braniff Category:May 1968 events ","title":"Braniff Flight 352"},{"id":"7446629","text":"The Aryan Path was an Anglo-Indian theosophical journal published in Bombay, India, between 1930 and 1960.

All are free-living carnivores. Most are found in fresh and brackish water, but three marine species are known. Their diet consists largely of Paramecium, although they will also attack and consume other ciliates. Some species, such as D. gargantua, also feed on non-ciliate protists, including dinoflagellates, cryptomonads, and green algae. ==Appearance and reproduction== Didinia are rounded, oval or barrel-shaped and range in length from 50 to 150 micrometres. The cell body is encircled by two ciliary bands, or pectinelles, an upper band and a lower band just below the midline. This distinguishes them from the related genus Monodinium, which have only a single band, except during cell division. The pectinelles are used to move Didinium through water by rotating the cell around its axis. At the anterior end, a cone-shaped structure protrudes, supported by a palisade of stiff microtubular rods (nematodesmata). This cone encloses the cytostome or \\"mouth\\" opening, as in other haptorian ciliates. The dimensions of this protuberance vary among the different species. The macronucleus is long, and may be curved, horseshoe- shaped or twisted into a shape resembling a figure eight. A contractile vacuole and anal aperture are in the posterior of the cell. Like all ciliates, Didinia reproduce asexually via binary fission, or sexually through conjugation. ==Didinium nasutum== Didinium nasutum consuming a Paramecium. Illustration by S. O. Mast, 1909 Much of what has been published about this genus is based on numerous studies of a single species, Didinium nasutum. A voracious predator, D. nasutum uses specialized structures called toxicysts to ensnare and paralyze its ciliate prey. Once captured, the prey is engulfed through Didinium's expandible cytostome. While D. nasutum is sometimes described as feeding exclusively upon Paramecium, it has been shown that the organism will readily devour other ciliate species, including Colpoda, Colpidium campylum, Tetrahymena pyriformis, Coleps hirtus and Lacrymaria olor. Moreover, strains of Didinium raised on a Colpidium campylum will actually show a preference for a diet made up of that species, as well as a diminished ability to kill and ingest Paramecia. In the absence of food, D. nasutum will encyst, lying dormant within a protective coating. In the laboratory, other environmental stimuli, such as the age of the growth medium or the accumulation of certain metabolic waste products, can also trigger encystment. When the encysted form of D. nasutum is exposed to a vigorous culture of Paramecium, it will excyst, reverting to its active, swimming form. Didinium cysts have been shown to remain viable for at least 10 years. ==History and classification== Vorticella nasuta, from O. F. M√ºller, 1786 Didinium was discovered by the eighteenth-century naturalist O.F. M√ºller and described in his Animalcula Infusoria under the name Vorticella nasuta.M√ºller, O.F. Animalcula Infusoria, Fluvia Tilia et Marina. 1786. Hauniae, Typis N. M√∂lleri. pp. 268-9. In 1859, Samuel Friedrich Stein moved the species to the newly created genus Didinium, which he placed within the order Peritricha, alongside other ciliates which have a ciliary fringe at the anterior of the cell such as Vorticella and Cothurnia. Later in the century, under the taxonomical scheme created by Otto B√ºtschli, Didinium was removed from among the Peritrichs, and placed in the order Holotricha. In 1974, John. O. Corliss created the order Haptorida, within the subclass Haptoria, for \\"rapacious carnivorous forms\\" such as Didinium, Dileptus and Spathidium. This group has since been placed in the class Litostomatea Small & Lynn, 1981. Genetic analysis of Haptorian ciliates has shown that they do not form a monophyletic group. ==List of Species== Didinium alveolatum Kahl, 1930 Didinium armatum Penard, 1922 Didinium balbianii Fabre-Domergue, 1888 Didinium bosphoricum Hovasse, 1932 Didinium chlorelligerum Kahl, 1935 Didinium faurei Kahl, 1930 Didinium gargantua Meunier, 1910 Didinium impressum Kahl, 1926 Didinium minimum Didinium nasutum (M√ºller, 1773) Stein, 1859 ==References== * Category:Ciliate genera Category:Litostomatea ","title":"Didinium"},{"id":"7446685","text":"Blotto is a 1930 American pre-Code comedy film directed by James Parrott and starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.

His plan is to steal the bottle that his wife has hidden in the house, and later blame the loss on the iceman. Mrs. Laurel immediately launches a scheme of her own: she replaces the alcohol with a non-alcoholic mixture. Stan and Ollie try in vain to open their own bottle quietly in the club. They then proceed to get \\"drunk\\" at the nightclub and are enjoying themselves watching the acts including an exotic dancer in the style of Josephine Baker. A balloon dancer is less stimulating but they enjoy the belly dancer. Meanwhile Mrs laurel has bought a gun. Then the angry Mrs. Laurel arrives carrying a shotgun (wrapped in paper). After revealing to them that their \\"liquor\\" is actually just cold tea, she chases them into the street, where the boys jump into a taxi cab to escape. Mrs. Laurel then completely demolishes the fleeing cab with one well-aimed blast from her gun. ==CastProduction== The film originally had no music except for the orchestral version of the \\"Ku Ku\\" tune on opening titles.Louvish, Simon. Stan and Ollie: The Roots of Comedy: The Double Life of Laurel and Hardy. New York: St. Martin's Press, 2002, p. 267. . The original version of the film also is not available for viewing and survives only in a censored 1937 re-release print which had pre-Code sequences removed (about one reel of material was cut). On that version, a background music track was added which was a mixture of a few Leroy Shield jazzy tunes and some music commonly used in 1937 Hal Roach films. Blotto is the only Laurel and Hardy film in which Laurel's character is married while Hardy's isn't. Although the original 1930 version is now considered a lost film, a Spanish language version produced by MGM, entitled La Vida Nocturna has survived which shows how the film was originally presented, including a gag involving an electric fan after Stan says he needs some \\"fresh air\\". This is not available in the English version due to negative damage. ==International versions== The film was reshot and entitled La Vida Nocturna for the Spanish language market. ==References* * Category:1930 films Category:1930 comedy films Category:American short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by James Parrott Category:Laurel and Hardy (film series) Category:American films Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer short films Category:Films with screenplays by H.

He was the inter- services champion in the long jump and was RAF champion in the high jump. ==Military career== Finlay joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in April 1935, and was posted to No. 17 Squadron and, later in 1936, to No. 54 Squadron RAF before attending the RAF School of Aeronautical Engineering at Henlow. During the Second World War Finlay was posted to fly Spitfires as commanding officer of his old No. 54 Squadron, then based at Hornchurch, on 26 August 1940, during the Battle of Britain. He was shot down over Ramsgate two days later and was wounded. After recovering he was posted to command No. 41 Squadron in September. He claimed his first victory, a Messerschmitt Bf 109, over the Channel on 23 September, and by the end of October 1940 he was credited with a 'share' in a second Bf 109 and a Dornier Do 17 bomber, and had also damaged a further three Bf 109s. His aircraft was damaged in combat with Oblt. Hans- Ekkehard Bob of JG 54 on 9 October 1940. He added to his tally on 23 November, shooting down the Bf 109E-1 (Werk No.3868 \\"Black 3\\") of Obgfr.

Finlay then commanded No. 608 Squadron RAF, flying Lockheed Hudsons in the Middle East from December 1943 to July 1944. He became a group captain and was posted as SASO, 210 Group. In 1945 he then commanded No. 906 Wing in Burma, being awarded an Air Force Cross in September 1944. As a group captain Finlay was posted to No. 1 School of Technical Training, RAF Halton, as senior technical training officer. He regularly took part in the station sports meeting and even at the age of 43 won every event he entered: 120-yard hurdles, 100 yard sprint, 220 yard sprint, high jump and the long jump. He entered the veterans' (over 40) handicap. He took the offered three yard start in full running kit, unlike all the other entrants who were in shirts and rolled-up trousers. From the start he raced to the tape, to show that he could've won if he wanted to. He then stopped, turned round and started to run back down the track. (An accusation of unsporting behaviour at this event seems to be very much out of character.) Finlay was stationed for much of his time at RAF Acklington, whose chapel contains a recently dedicated stained glass window to honour him. He retired from the RAF in February 1959. Finlay was severely injured and paralysed in a motor vehicle accident in 1966, which led to his death on 19 April 1970, aged sixty.

During the 1960s and 1970s, KFJZ was a leading Top 40 station in Fort Worth. In 1980, it changed format to Music of Your Life adult standards, having moved the Top 40 format to KFJZ-FM 97.1. ===Later years=== In 1984 KFJZ's call letters were changed to KSSA. (The historic KFJZ call letters were then picked up by a Dallas station operating on AM 870.) Marcos A. Rodriguez purchased KSSA in November 1986 and moved a Regional Mexican music format from FM (see KLTY) to the AM dial. AM 1270 has been a Spanish- language station since then under various call signs, becoming KESS from 1986 until 1990, when it briefly became KSBN, then returning to KESS starting the next year until 2004, when it adopted KFLC.In 1924, the KFLC call sign had been assigned to a temporary station on 1330 kHz located at the State Fair of Texas in Dallas. The station has operated from transmitter tower sites in Birdville (north east Fort Worth), 4801 West Vickery (now site of a school) in south west Fort Worth, and the present site on the Arlington/Fort Worth line. From 1976 to 2006 the station operated at 5,000 watts on six towers (nominal power while actual input was 5,400 watts by day and 4,600 by night). A refit spearheaded by station engineering manager Patrick Parks and VP/Engineering David Stewart led to a rebuild, new towers, and a power increase to 50,000 watts. Matt Folkert at duTreil, Lundin and Rackley designed the new digital capable phasing and distribution system. Even before switching to the current all-sports format, KFLC was the first station to broadcast Dallas Mavericks basketball games in Spanish. By the early 2000s, KFLC began eliminating music programming most of the day to air local Spanish-language talk shows. Starting on July 4, 2012, the station became part of the Univision America Talk Radio network,\\"Univision To Launch National Talk Network\\" by Lance Venta, May 20, 2012. (radioinsight.com) and adopted the slogan \\"Univision America Dallas 1270\\". In 2015, KFLC ended the Univision America news/talk format in favor of Spanish-language Contemporary Christian music as \\"Amor Celestial 1270\\" (translated as \\"Heavenly Love 1270\\"). On December 20, 2016, Univision announced that KFLC would be a charter network affiliate of Univision Deportes Radio, a Spanish-language sports network, which launched on April 19, 2017\\"Univision To Launch Univision Deportes Radio\\" by Lance Venta, December 19, 2016 (radioinsight.com) and was renamed TUDN Radio on July 20, 2019. KFLC also signed up to air Texas Rangers baseball games until at least 2019. (KESS had previously broadcast Rangers games from 1999 to 2010.) KFLC continued to carry Dallas Mavericks games as well as adding FC Dallas soccer games. This move filled the Spanish Sports hole after KZMP 1540 AM swapped from ESPN Deportes Radio to a simulcast of an FM Regional Mexican station. KZMP later returned to ESPN Deportes, until that network shut down on September 8, 2019, leaving KFLC once again as the metroplex's lone Spanish sports station. ==References *TUDN Radio Dallas (Official Station Page) *FCC History Cards for KFLC (covering KFQB / KTAT / KSAT / KFJZ from 1927-1981) *DFW Radio Archives (dfwradioarchives.info) *DFW Radio/TV History by Mike Shannon (dfwretroplex.com) FLC FLC Category:Univision Radio Network stations Category:Radio stations established in 1924 ","title":"KFLC"},{"id":"7446749","text":"Joseph Peter Tafoya (born September 6, 1978) is a former American National Football League player and entrepreneur.

Thousands of lithium-ion batteries, of the 18650 variant, were proposed as suitable for the rechargeable battery system. The prototype eBox was unveiled in Santa Monica, California on August 18, 2006. The prototype used a battery pack consisting of 5,300 Li-ion cells arranged into 100 blocks of 53 cells each. The first production eBox was delivered to actor Tom Hanks on February 15, 2007. ==Pricing== Estimated cost of this conversion exceeds US$50,000 in addition to the base vehicle cost (excluding the cost of the gasoline engine, that is replaced in the conversion), while high-volume OEM additional cost is projected at about $10,000. It appears that high-volume production by original vehicle manufacturers using AC production components is a goal, with the low- volume production being an intermediate step. AC Propulsion offers the conversion for US$55,000. ==Specifications== *Acceleration: 0 to 60 mph in 7.0 seconds. *Top Speed: *Range: * Motor: AC induction motor *Battery pack: 5,088 Li-Ion cells, 355V nominal, 35kWh, *Battery charger: On board, 100-250VAC, 50/60 Hz, includes Vehicle to Grid (V2G) and UPS (generator mode) capability **Charge rate: up to 20 kW; 30 minutes for 20‚Äì50 miles **Full Charge: 2 hours (fast), 5 hours (normal) *Energy Efficiency: 180 AC Wh/km in typical driving (648 kJ/km) ==References * Company website * Review and video gallery (Stefano Paris) * Video of a test drive (Stefano Paris), Google Video format * Pictures and notes from the company's October 2003 presentation (Electrifyingtimes.com) * Informational article from August 2006 which provides updated information as to eBox price, quality, availability, company views.

He is the brother of former All Black Sione Lauaki. He is the cousin of rugby league and union star Tevita Vaikona. ==Early years== Lauaki was educated at Waitakere College and then at Kelston Boys High School and played for the Waitemata Seagulls and Glenora Bears in the Auckland Rugby League competition. ==New Zealand Warriors== He was signed by the New Zealand Warriors and made his first grade d√©but on 14 March 2004 against Brisbane Broncos at Suncorp Stadium. During his Warriors career he was used mainly as an interchange player, starting only ten games in sixty nine appearances. When not selected for the first grade side, Lauaki played for the Waitakere Rangers in the Bartercard Cup and the Auckland Lions and Auckland Vulcans in the NSW Cup. In 2007 he signed a three-year extension with the Warriors, making him a Warrior until the end of the 2010 season.Lauaki signs to remain with the Vodafone Warriors for 3 years rleague.com, 29 October 2007 ==Hull== On 23 February 2009 it was announced that Lauaki had been released by the Warriors so he could sign a 3-year deal to play for Hull F.C. in the Super League. He made his Super League d√©but for Hull against Harlequins RL on 21 August 2009 and has since made himself a crowd favourite at the KC Stadium. After finally arriving at the KC Stadium late in 2009, Lauaki made his intentions clear with a number of brutally committed displays. The hard-working, powerful second-rower or prop forward will provide some serious physicality, along with good feet and a great offload and many teams will fear him this season. Those attributes were epitomised in 2010, with a stunning hand off on Leon Pryce to score against St. Helens on the opening day of the season, before a similar try against Salford later that year as he held off four men to touch down. ==Wigan== Lauaki joined Wigan in 2012. He made 35 appearances for the club, scoring two tries, before being released in January 2014. He signed with the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles, but did not play a game and was released at the end of 2014. ==Bradford Bulls== 2015 - 2015 Season Lauaki signed for Bradford on a 2 Year Deal. He did not feature in any of the pre-season friendlies. He featured in Round 3 (Featherstone Rovers) then in Round 5 (Batley Bulldogs) to Round 7 (Halifax). He played in Round 9 (London Broncos) then in Round 11 (Sheffield Eagles) to Round 18 (Workington Town). He played in Round 21 (Sheffield Eagles) to Round 23 (Halifax).

He was born in Tokyo on 13 March 1947 as Shigeru Tamura (, Tamura Shigeru).Akihide Tamura should not be confused with the well- known photographer Shigeru Tamura (1909-87), whose name is even written with the same kanji. (Perhaps part of the reason for the younger Tamura's change of name was to avoid this very confusion.) He studied at Tokyo College of Photography, graduating first in 1967 and then from a more advanced course two years later. Tamura's first solo exhibition -- under the name Shigeru Tamura () -- was Yume no hikari (Dream light) in Ginza Nikon Salon in 1969. He became known for his somewhat harsh monochrome depictions of landscapes. In 1974 his works appeared within the \\"New Japanese Photography\\" show in the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Tamura made the stills for several of the late films of Akira Kurosawa, and has published a book of photographs taken on the sets of Kurosawa's films. ==NotesBooks by Tamura== *Tamura Photographs (1983) *Base.

He was known professionally as Avrom, though some of his work was also signed Armand, Richards or Tin√≤di. In 1966-67, he was president of the Canadian Society of Graphic Art. His son was musician and restaurateur Zalman Yanovsky. == Early life == Yanovsky was born in 1911 at Krivoi Rog, in Tsarist Russia (now Ukraine), and came to Canada at two years of age with his family. In Winnipeg, Manitoba he was educated at the I.L. Peretz Shule and St. John's Technical High School. He also took classes at the Winnipeg School of Art and, after moving to Toronto, Ontario, the Ontario College of Art. In 1938-39, he attended the American Artists School in New York City. He joined the Young Communist League in Winnipeg in his teens and subsequently became a lifelong member of the Communist Party of Canada.Ester Reiter, A Future without Hate or Need: The Promise of the Jewish Left in Canada (Toronto: Between the Lines, 2016), pp. 277-278. == Cartoons == In the 1930s, Yanovsky's cartoons and illustrations appeared in left-oriented periodicals such as Masses and New Frontier and party newspapers such as The Worker and its successor, the Daily Clarion. From the 1940s to the 1970s, he published in the Canadian Tribune and a number of union and ethnic newspapers and leftist magazines. His cartoons attacked unemployment, poverty, fascism, racism and capitalism. They also promoted labour unions, human rights, anti-imperialism and other causes, including, by the 1950s, Canadian nationalism, peaceful coexistence and nuclear disarmament.Anna Hudson, Free Discussion is the Key to Peace: The Political Cartoons of Avrom Yanovsky (Toronto: Samuel J. Zacks Gallery, 2005). \\"Although not well known to the general public in Canada,\\" stated a history of political cartoons published in 1979, \\"his work was reproduced in numerous socialist publications throughout the world during the last forty years.\\"Terry Mosher (Aislin) and Peter Desbarats, The Hecklers: A History of Canadian Political Cartooning and a Cartoonists' History of Canada (Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1979), p. 227. An exhibition of Yanovsky's political cartoons was held at the Samuel J. Zacks Gallery in Toronto in 2005. Curator Anna Hudson stated: \\"What is so surprising about his political cartoons is how relevant the messages remain.\\"Hudson, Free Discussion is the Key to Peace. The exhibition was also discussed in David Abramowitz, \\"Exhibiting the Political Cartoons of Avrom Yanovsky,\\" Outlook (January/February 2006). == Other Art == Although known mainly as a cartoonist, Yanovsky also exhibited sketches, drawings and lithographs at the annual shows held by the Canadian Society of Graphic Art.\\"Who's Who in Ontario Art,\\" Ontario Library Review, XXXII, 3 (August 1948), p. 245. In 1952, he published a folio of lithographs.Avrom, Twelve Litho Prints (Toronto, 1952). During the brief heyday of Canadian comic books in the 1940s, he created stories and art for several series published by Bell Features.Michael Hirsh and Patrick Loubert, The Great Canadian Comic Books (Toronto: Peter Martin Associates, 1971), pp, 78-80, 148-149, 258. Yanovsky also designed costumes and settings for stage productions, especially those associated with the Labour League Mutual Benefit Society, later part of the United Jewish People's Order, where he was an active member.Reiter, A Future without Hate or Need, pp. 277-278. In 1958, he was appointed as the editor of the English section of the Canadian Jewish weekly Vochenblatt. Throughout his career, Yanovsky gave entertaining chalk-talks on political, historical and biblical themes to children's classes, union meetings and other audiences.Reiter, A Future without Hate or Need, pp. 277-278. He was also known for a mural depicting the Canadian doctor Norman Bethune, which was completed in 1964 for display at Communist Party headquarters in Toronto.Marxist Quarterly, 12 (Winter 1965), at pp. 64-65. In recent years, several websites have posted examples of his art, including photographs of the Bethune mural.The mural is among the several images on the website \\"Today's Inspiration: The Artists of the Canadian Whites: Avrom Yanovsky (1911-1979),\\" posted June 6, 2013.

A Huaso folklorist sings the Cueca (the Chilean national dance) during the Fiestas Patrias The Fiestas Patrias (literally Homeland Holidays)Collins Spanish to English Dictionary, patrio. of Chile consist of two days, with a third one added on some years: * 18 September, in commemoration of the proclamation of the First Governing Body of 1810, and marking the beginning of the Chilean Independence process. * 19 September, known as the \\"Day of the Glories of the Army\\". * Since 2007, 17 September (if it should be a Monday) or 20 September (if it should be a Friday) will be included as well. Within Chile the Fiestas Patrias are often referred to as the Dieciocho, or \\"18th\\" because the celebration occurs on 18 September. Unofficially, the celebration can last for around a week, depending on when it falls. For example, if the 18th is a Wednesday, public holidays are from Wednesday the 18th to Friday the 20th and celebrations begin the afternoon of Tuesday the 17th and continue until Sunday the 22nd. It is held close to the spring equinox of the Southern Hemisphere so it doubles as a spring festival. Chile's Declaration of Independence happened on 12 February. Most schools and jobs declare a week-long vacation for the holiday. This day is very important to the Chilean people because they are celebrating their freedom from Spanish rule. Being widespread in rural areas of Chile Mexican corrido is often played in Fiestas Patrias. In popular celebrations traditional Chilean music such as cueca and tonada are not as common as the foreign music styles of corrido and cumbia. ==Activities== The celebration of Fiestas Patrias is an expression of Chilean culture. Traditional activities associated with the Dieciocho include Chilean rodeo, dancing the cueca, going to fondas, and barbecue. Officially, activities on September eighteen are centered on a religious celebration \\"Te Deum Ecum√©nico de Fiestas Patrias\\". This ceremony, which is organized by the Catholic Church and led by the Archbishop of Santiago, has taken place since 1811 when it was started by Jos√© Miguel Carrera. In 1971, President Salvador Allende asked that the celebration become more ecumenical, encompassing the diverse religious beliefs throughout the country. The ceremony itself begins at 11:00 am in the Plaza de Armas. Military parades and civil school parades are held on this day in major cities and towns nationwide. Many Chileans travel during the Fiestas Patrias to visit family, friends and relatives in other parts of the country and join the celebrations there. In Santiago, many people travel to resorts on the Pacific coast, especially Vi√±a del Mar and the Litoral Central region. It is estimated that 2 million Chileans‚Äînearly one-eighth of the country's population‚Äîtravel during this holiday. 19 September, the anniversary of the installation of the First Government Council and the very first military parade in Chilean history, marks the grand finale: the Great Military Parade of Chile commemorating the glories of the Chilean Army, on Santiago's O'Higgins Park and overseen by the President of Chile in his/her performance of his/her constitutional mandate as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. Attracting millions of people, and simulcast live on radio, television and on the Internet, the parade, led by the Chilean Armed Forces (Chilean Army, Chilean Navy and Chilean Air Force) and the Carabineros de Chile, plus since 2019 the Investigations Police of Chile, takes place in the afternoon, and (when 19 September is a Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday) marks the end of the holiday. ==Traditional food== 190px Consumption of traditional Chilean foods is one of the principal displays of the Fiestas Patrias. Chileans prepare these foods in their homes, or they go to fondas. Fondas are venues, often tents, prepared and decorated for the Fiestas Patrias where traditional Chilean dishes and beverages are served. The largest fondas are found in Parque O'Higgins. Each year the Chilean President kicks off the Fiestas Patrias celebrations at one of these locales. For many years, the selected fonda was La Grandiosa Bertita. The predominant food associated with the Fiestas Patrias are Chilean empanadas, which are a sort of bread pastry. The filling of these empanadas consist of pino, a mixture of chopped beef and onion, as well as half of a hard-boiled egg, raisins, and an olive. Many Chileans also throw a barbecue for the Fiestas Patrias. During this time sales of meat products exceed $50 million. During the Fiestas Patrias the preferred drink is chicha, a lightly alcoholic beverage typically made from grapes, although apple chicha is popular in southern Chile. Red wine enjoys popularity during the holiday, while pisco, the so-called \\"national liquor\\", becomes secondary. Alfajores are a typical dessert. They consist of two lightly breaded cookies joined with manjar, a sweet filling made from caramelized condensed milk. ==Use of the flag== In Chile, it is mandatory to hang the Chilean flag from every building in the country on 18 and 19 September (and 21 May as well). The flag should be in perfect condition, hung from a white pole or from the front of every building, horizontally or vertically. If hung vertically, the star should always be in the upper left corner, visible from the front of the building. Violation of this rule is punishable with fines in local currency of up to 40,000 pesos (about US$80), although it is not strictly enforced. ==Gallery== File:Llegada del Presidente Prieto a la Pampilla.PNGSeptember 19, by Johann Moritz Rugendas, 1837 File:Parque Cousi√±o.jpgErnest Charton's oil painting September the 18th in Santiago, 1845 File:18 de Septiembre Chile, baile en la casa de gobierno.pngSeptember 18, by Claudio Gay, 1854 File:Una chingana - Chile.jpgClaudio Gay, Una Chingana, 1854 ==References== Category:Armed Forces days Category:National days Category:History of Chile Category:Chilean society Category:Chilean culture Category:September observances Category:Annual events in Chile Category:Spring (season) events in Chile ","title":"Fiestas Patrias (Chile)"},{"id":"7446897","text":"The Duchy of Montferrat was a state located in Northern Italy. It was created out of what was left of the medieval March of Montferrat after the last Palaeologus heir had died (1533) and the margraviate had been briefly controlled by Habsburg Spain (until 1536). After that brief interlude, it passed to the Gonzaga dukes of Mantua, in 1574. Its territory, located in southern Piedmont, is still known today as Montferrat. At that time, the state of Montferrat had an area of 2750 km2, and consisted of two separate parts bordered by the Duchy of Savoy, the Duchy of Milan, and the Republic of Genoa. Its capital was Casale Monferrato. With the War of the Mantuan Succession (1628-1631), a piece of the duchy passed to Savoy; the remainder passed to Savoy in 1708, as Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, gained possession of the principal Gonzaga territory, the Duchy of Mantua. ==See also== *Rulers of Montferrat, for a list of margraves and dukes ==References== *\\"Casale Monferrato\\".

Baroda dynamite case is the term used for the criminal case launched by the Indira Gandhi government in India during the Indian Emergency (1975 - 77) against the opposition leader George Fernandes and 24 others. The Central Bureau of Investigation charged George and others of smuggling dynamite to blow up government establishments and railway tracks in protest against state of emergency. They were also charged with waging war against the state to overthrow the government. The accused were arrested in June 1976 and imprisoned in Tihar Jail, Delhi. The other prominent accused included Viren J. Shah, G.G. Parikh, C.G.K. Reddy, Prabhudas Patwari, and Devi Gujjar. The case was tried in Delhi, as the CBI argued that even though the site of the incident was Baroda, the case had national ramifications. Fernandes fought the 1977 Lok Sabha election from Muzaffarpur in Bihar while in jail under trial in the case. He swept the polls, with his supporters campaigning with his photo in prison cage and chains. Janata Party withdrew the case on coming to power in 1977 and all accused were released. Snehalata Reddy was an Indian film actress. Snehalata and her husband participated in the anti-Emergency movement. Snehalata was a close friend of George Fernandes and was arrested on 2 May 1976. She was arrested for being a part of the Baroda dynamite case; however, while George Fernandes and many others were made accused in the case, Snehalata's name was not on the final charge-sheet. Even so, she was kept as a prisoner, where she was regularly tortured and was confined to live in inhuman conditions in prison at Bangalore. When later her health deteriorated, she was released on parole on 15 January 1977.

It was released on VHS in the UK as Silent Voice.https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B000KEDBT8/ The film‚Äôs release came in a critical historical context, amid the deterioration of United States-Soviet Union relations, escalation of hostile political rhetoric and deepening public concern about ‚Äúthe nuclear threat‚Äù in the 1980s. The film was released one month before Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev announced the perestroika reforms. ==Plot== Chuck Murdock (Joshua Zuehlke), a 12-year-old boy from Montana and the son of a military jet pilot, becomes anxious after seeing a Minuteman missile on a school field trip, which is intensified by a nightmare of a fork dropping after being told that the speed and effectiveness would be done \\"before a dropped fork hits the floor\\". Chuck protests the existence of nuclear weapons by refusing to play baseball, which results in the forfeit of a Little League game by his team. \\"Amazing Grace\\" Smith, a fictional Boston Celtics player (played by NBA star Alex English), catches a blurb about the story in his newspaper and decides to emulate Chuck, saying he will no longer participate in professional basketball unless there are no more nuclear weapons. This gives it nationwide coverage, inspiring more pro athletes to join the protest against nuclear weapons. Smith then moves to Montana to meet with Chuck and buys an old barn, which he and the other athletes renovate into their residence. Smith's agent, Lynn (Jamie Lee Curtis) is unsure about what he hopes to accomplish but decides to support him and Chuck. The film reaches a climax when the President of the United States (Gregory Peck) personally meets with Chuck, admiring his resolve but at the same time explaining the practical difficulties of disarmament. ==Cast== * Dean Alexander as Sports Broadcaster * Jamie Lee Curtis as Lynn Taylor * Jim Allen as Missile Soldier * Gregory Peck as President * William Petersen as Russell * Red Auerbach as Himself * Lee Richardson as Jeffries * Joshua Zuehlke as Chuck Murdock * Alex English as Amazing Grace Smith * Alan Autry as George * Michael Bowen as Hot Dog * Frances Conroy as Pamela ==ReferencesCategory:1987 films Category:1980s sports drama films Category:American baseball films Category:American basketball films Category:American sports drama films Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:Films scored by Elmer Bernstein Category:Films about fictional presidents of the United States Category:Films about nuclear war and weapons Category:Films directed by Mike Newell Category:Films set in Montana Category:Films shot in Montana Category:TriStar Pictures films Category:1987 drama films ","title":"Amazing Grace and Chuck"},{"id":"7447014","text":"ACEVO (Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations) is a membership body for the leaders of third sector organisations in England and Wales. ACEVO has sister organisations in Scotland (acosvo) and Northern Ireland (CO3 Chief Officers 3rd Sector. ==Aims== ACEVO's vision is to see civil society leaders making the biggest possible difference. Its stated aims are to connect, develop and represent civil society leaders. In turn, these aims are met by offering professional development and peer learning opportunities; providing informal networking events and tailored advice to all members; and lobbying the UK government on behalf of its members. These three aims are all intended to make the sector more effective and impactful. ACEVO is a registered charity [number 1114591]. ==History== ACEVO was started in 1987 by three charity chief executives who felt isolated in their positions, and wanted to establish a networking group of third sector leaders. Its original name was ACENVO - Association of Chief Executives of National Voluntary Organisations - but its membership now encompasses the leaders of charities and not-for-profits from small, community based groups, ambitious medium-sized organisations, and well known national and international not-for- profits. Current chief executive Vicky Browning took over in 2017 following previous CEOs Sir Stephen Bubb (2000-2016) and Dororthy Dalton (1987-2000). ACEVO celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2017. It has over 1,100 members and a staff of 11 FTE. ==Membership== ACEVO's membership is primarily drawn from England and Wales, (third sector leaders in Scotland or Northern Ireland can join ACOSVO or CO3 respectively). Full members are CEOs (or equivalent) at charities and social enterprises. Associate membership is offered to anyone with an interest in sector leadership, including chairs and trustees (but excluding for-profit organisations), and aspiring CEOs join as senior leader members. Private organisations wishing to support and work with the sector may become part of the network as commercial partners. Membership fees are graduated by the turnover of the organisation the CEO represents. Members join primarily for peer support and professional development through networking, training and events. Members also benefit from information services, and from legal and emotional support in the event that their job is put at risk. ACEVO also represents the voice and views of civil society leaders to influencers including the government and the media. ==Influencing== ACEVO has been influential within the UK in campaigning on behalf of third sector leaders, most notably on issues of governance, leadership and funding. ACEVO is a strategic partner of the Cabinet Office's Office for Civil Society, and has been involved in the government's numerous task forces and working groups. Together with New Philanthropy Capital, ACEVO developed and pioneered the concept of Full Cost Recovery, which states that third sector organisations should cost their work robustly, and that the funding they receive from government should be sustainable. ==Criticism== ACEVO has been criticised by other voluntary sector organisations for taking political stance in favour of charities assisting with the privatisation of public services such as healthcare and prisons. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations criticised a 2005 ACEVO report warning it could \\"warp public perception of the role of the sector\\". ==ReferencesCategory:Charities based in the United Kingdom Category:Organisations based in the City of London ","title":"Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations"},{"id":"7447016","text":"Fabio Grossi (born 1 October 1977, in Rome) is a retired Italian dancer and ballet teacher. ==Early life== He trained at the Accademia Nazionale di Danza in Rome, where he graduated with full marks.Brillano le stelle della danza: Letizia Giuliani, Fabio Grossi, Viviana Durante - Il Tempo (2006) He studied all over Europe with many international teachers including Marika Besobrasova, Rosella Hightower, Patricia Carey, Wilhelm Burmann, Philip Beamish, Raymond Franchetti. ==Performing career== At age 19, Grossi was a First Prize Winner at the Rieti Dance Competition in ItalyAlbo d'oro, Spoleto Ballet Competition and the only Italian to be a Finalist and a Diploma Winner at the 1997 Moscow International Ballet Competition in Russia, which was directed by Yuri Grigorovich.Ballerini famosi, Dance Village On October 11, 1997 he made his debut as a Soloist with Aterballetto (Italy).

Zhang has performed a spin position that her mother has called the Pearl spin, a cross between a catch-foot layback spin and a Biellmann spin. In this spin, the free leg is brought up to waist-height and the free blade is grasped with both hands. The back and head are bent down towards the knee, with the free leg held above the head in a Biellmann position. This makes the spin, in essence, a catch-foot layback in a Biellmann position, because the Biellmann position, according to regulations, is achieved when the level of the boot passes the head so that the boot is above and behind or over the head. It is a layback spin because it is an upright spin with the head and shoulders dropped backwards and the back arched downwards toward the ice. This position has become Zhang's signature spin. Zhang performs a hyper-extended Biellmann spin Zhang also performs a hyper- extended Biellmann spin. She is one of several young skaters to perform this move. In this variation, the leg is pulled straight up in the air and the back bent as far into the spin as possible. Zhang is able to perform the spin with her free leg pulled straight up into the air, with very little knee bend, making the spin look closer to a capital-I position than the usual Biellmann teardrop shape. She has received a straight +3.00 grade of execution for her layback spin. ==Programs== arabesque spiral during her Ave Maria free skate at the 2009 Four Continents Championships. {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" - !

The squad currently plays in Primera B Metropolitana, the regionalised third division of the Argentine football league system. ==HistoryThe beginning=== The club was founded on 1 April 1908, in Buenos Aires by a group of anarchists who discussed fighting for better conditions for the working class. That was the reason that originated its first name, Club Atl√©tico Libertarios Unidos, naming Jos√© Garrone as its first president. The colors adopted were red with a horizontal black stripe paying tribute to their anarchist ideology. Libertarios Unidos' first field was placed just beside the Defensores de Belgrano stadium, in the corner of Blandengues and Manzanares streets of Buenos Aires. Libertarios Unidos was soon forced to change its name, because the government had prohibited any anarchist expression (some sources state that it was the Police Chief Ram√≥n Falc√≥n himself who obliged them to change the name). So the club was renamed as Sportivo del Norte in 1919. ===1920 decade=== Sportivo del Norte obtained the promotion to Primera B in 1919 and one year later the team was playing its first match in Primera Divisi√≥n, where it finished 8th.Argentina 1920 at RSSSF In 1924 Sportivo had to leave its field in Blandengues and Manzanares, moving to Colegiales district. The club soon renamed honoring its new home, changing not only its name to \\"Club Atl√©tico Colegiales\\" (in 1925) but its uniform colors, which became blue, red and gold. They have remained the club colors up to present days. In 1926 Colegiales registered to dissident body, Asociaci√≥n Amateurs de Football (AAmF) where the team made a good campaign with a squad nicknamed \\"Los Fen√≥menos (The Phenomenons)\\" due to the skilled players that formed it. Most frequently line-up was: Tauzlet; Rossi, Tachini; Del Corro, Machiavello, Alberico; Mart√≠nez, Toscano, Giudice, Granara Costa, Paduano. Nevertheless, when both leagues merged at the end of the 1926 season, six AAmF teams were disaffiliated (with Colegiales among them) and all their matches annulled. As a result, those clubs were sent to the second division, named \\"Primera Divisi√≥n-Secci√≥n B\\".Argentina 1926 by Pablo Ciullini on RSSSF In 1928 Colegiales won the second division championship promoting to Primera Divisi√≥n. The line-up was: Santiago Sesana; Rossi, Silva; Del Corro, Pausini, Felipelli; Mart√≠nez, Toscano, Giudice, Gonz√°lez, Coviello. ===1930‚Äì56=== The 1947 team that won the Primera C (then \\"Primera Amateur\\") title. Colegiales had a poor campaign in 1930 and was relegated to Liga Amateur, where the team finished 2nd (after Sportivo Barracas in 1932. Some restructuring in Argentine football relegated Colegiales to the second division. By then the club had moved again, establishing its new home in Fraga and Estomba streets and soon after the club moved to Villa Martelli. In 1944 Colegiales was relegated to the third division (now Primera C). After two consecutive seasons finishing 2nd, the team finally won the 1947 championship. The team went through the season unbeaten, with 77 goals scored (an average of 3 per game) and only 23 goals conceded. During that year Colegiales played its home games in different venues so the club had forced to move from Villa Martelli. The champion line- up was: Incardona; A. Dardenne, Arrillaga; F. Baloira, Auad, C√©spedes; Coudannes, A. Baloira, Cantamessi, Archero, E. Dardenne. In 1948 the club moved to its current sports field of Antonio Malaver and Gervasio Posadas streets in Florida Oeste, Buenos Aires. A new restructuring in Argentine football relegated Colegiales to a lower division, until 6 January 1956, when the squad won another title when defeated Los Andes 1‚Äì0. Coached by Guido Ugobono, the line-up for that match was: Negri; √Ålvarez, Cosentino; P√©rez, Arag√≥n, Cappano; Fassani, Morales, L√≥pez, Tognola, Vecino (who scored the goal). But Colegiales only lasted one season in Primera B, so the team was relegated again in 1956. ===1957‚Äìpresent=== Colegiales won its second championship in 1955. Colegiales returned to Primera B after winning the 1992‚Äì93 title, defeating Argentino de Quilmes 1‚Äì0 in the last game. The team was coached by Rub√©n Moreno. Colegiales only lasted one season so in 1994 the team was relegated to Primera C again although Cole would return a year later, after winning the Torneo Reducido. Colegiales remained in the division until the team was relegated to Primera C in 2001. In 2002 the team reached the finals to promote to the upper division but was defeated by Deportivo Laferrere. The next year Colegiales finally got the promotion after beating Villa D√°lmine, although the club was punished by the riot caused by its supporters in a match against Tigre. The Argentine Football Association punished Colegiales deducting 9 points to the team, therefore it was relegated to a lower division at the end of the season. In 2008 Colegiales promoted to Primera B when beating Justo Jos√© de Urquiza. Colegiales made a great campaign in that division, reaching the finals against Deportivo Merlo (which finally promoted to Primera B Nacional). In 2011 Colegiales took part in the relaunched Copa Argentina (which had not been played since 1931) being defeated by Independiente 4‚Äì0 in the first stage. ==Uniform evolution== The first team jersey was red with a black stripe, taking the colors that identified the anarchistic movement. In 1924, the current three-colored uniform of blue, red and yellow was finally adopted and this combination has remained until now. {     } (1) Kit uniforms worn just for that season. ==Stadium== Stadium's entrance on G. Posadas street. The club currently plays at \\"Libertarios Unidos\\" stadium, sited in Antonio Malaver and Gervasio Posadas streets in Florida Oeste, Buenos Aires, since 1948. As time went by, Colegiales played its home games in diverse stadiums, most of them situated in the city of Buenos Aires: the first in Blandengues y Manzanares streets (1908), then in Teodoro Garc√≠a and Giribone streets in Colegiales neighbourhood (1924), and the last in Fraga and Estomba streets (1941). In 1948 Colegiales moved to Villa Martelli, Vicente L√≥pez Partido, where hosted a brief time previously to the move to Florida Oeste where the club has remained since then.Colegiales cumple 100 a√±os After Colegiales promoted to Primera B Metro in 1993, the club built its first and only seated grandstands with capacity for 500 people. In 2005 the stadium increased its capacity to 8,500 after a new grandstand was built, naming it \\"Tribuna Libertarios Unidos\\".

The B4406 road runs through part of the village. The village is at the confluence of the Glasgwm and Machno rivers. It has a five-arched, stone bridge dating from 1785. The village has been referred to as Pennant Machno, Llandudclyd and Llan dutchyd in historical sources. According to the 2011 census, the population of the Bro Machno parish (which also includes the village of Cwm Penmachno, about 5 km south west) was 617, of whom 342 (55%) were able to speak Welsh and 214 (34%) had no skills in Welsh. ==Toponymy== The village has been referred to as Pennant Machno, Llandudclyd and Llan dutchyd in historical sources. The name derives from the Welsh pen, meaning head, end or promontory and Machno, the name of the valley. ==Notable residents== It is renowned as the birthplace of Bishop William Morgan (probably 1545 ‚Äì 1604), who was born at T≈∑ Mawr, Y Wybrnant, near the village. The precise year of his birth is uncertain: it is generally accepted to be 1545, but his memorial in St John's College Chapel, Cambridge suggests 1541.Memorial Cambridge He was one of the leading scholars of his day, having mastered Hebrew in addition to Latin and Greek. He was the first to translate the Bible in its entirety into Welsh. T≈∑ Mawr is now a National Trust property open to the public and contains a Bible museum. Ty Mawr Wybrnant Poet, local historian, building contractor and quarry owner Owen Gethin Jones (1816 - 1883) was born, lived and died in Penmachno. Huw Owen alias Huw Machno (1585 - 1637), poet, is recorded by Owen Gethin Jones as living at Coed-y-Ffynnon in Penmachno (). Gethin Jones writes in his essay (\\"Gweithiau Gethin\\" (The Works of Gethin)): A gravestone inscribed 'H. M. Obiit 1637' exists. It is claimed that Huw Machno was descended from Dafydd Goch of Penmachno, an illegitimate son of Dafydd III (1238 - 1283, the last independent ruler of Wales as the Prince of Wales) and therefore a grandson of Llywelyn the Great. Richard Edgar Thomas (known as Richie Thomas) (1906 - 1988), the tenor, was born at Eirianfa, Llewelyn Street, Penmachno and lived his whole life in the village. He worked at the Machno Woollen Mill (Richie Thomas working at Woollen Mill) and led the singing in his chapel for over 50 years. He first came to prominence when he won the Blue Riband at the Rhyl National Eisteddfod in 1953. He gave many concerts and numerous recordings were made, and a double album of his best work was released in 2008 under the title ‚Ä≤Richie Thomas - Goreuon Richie Thomas (Tenor)‚Ä≤ (The Best of Richie Thomas). There is a plaque to commemorate him at his birthplace. Howel Harris Hughes (1873-1956), Principal of the United Theological College in Aberystwyth ministered here from 1901 to 1903.Howel Harris Hughes on the Dictionary of Welsh Biography ==Parish Church== The Carausius Stone The parish church of Saint Tudclud (alternatively Tyddyd, Tudclyd, Tudglud or Tudglyd), was built in the mid-19th century, but contains five important early Christian inscribed stone slabs dating from the 5th or 6th century. The Carausius Stone, which bears the Chi Rho symbol, was found in 1856 with two of the others when the site of the church was being cleared. It has been suggested that it is the gravestone of Carausius, a Roman military commander who usurped power in 286 and was assassinated in 293 (see Carausian Revolt), who is possibly the same person as St Caron to whom the church in Tregaron is dedicated. Another commemorates Cantiorix as a citizen of Gwynedd and cousin of the magistrate (the local ruler under the Romans, suggesting that the Roman political structure was retained locally into the 5th century after the departure of the legions). The inscription reads: Cantiorix hic iacit / Venedotis cives fuit / consobrinos Magli magistrati (\\"Here lies Cantiorix / He was a citizen of Gwynedd / and cousin of the magistrate Maglos\\".) The third of these slabs reads \\"ORIA [H]IC IACIT\\" or \\"Oria lies here\\". A fourth stone slab was discovered in the old garden wall of the Eagles Hotel (about 40 m from the church and 15 m from the churchyard) in 1915; one interpretation of its inscription is \\"...son of Avitorius... in the time of Justinus the Consul\\". There was a consul called Justinus in 540, but the inscription is unclear and could refer to Justus (328); the broadest date range for the slab is 328 - 650. Several academics have recently suggested that the inscription refers to the Byzantine Emperor Justin II, who was consul repeatedly between 567 and 574; it is argued that this is one of a number of instances of close links between post-Roman Britain and the Byzantine Empire.See 'Britain, the Byzantine Empire, and the concept of an Anglo-Saxon 'Heptarchy': Harun ibn Yahya's ninth-century Arabic description of Britain', by Caitlin Green, on http://www.caitlingreen.org/2016/04/heptarchy-harun-ibn-yahya.html. See footnote 12 of that article for instances of other historians who agree with Dr Green's suggestion. The fifth slab was discovered during quarrying near the Roman road in Rhiwbach, Cwm Penmachno and just features a cross. Stained glass window depicting Llywelyn ap Iorwerth (Llywelyn the Great) The chancel of the present church stands on the site of a previous church which burnt down in 1713. Three of the stone slabs were discovered when the older church was dismantled. Also discovered was a wall of a 12th-century church; this was the church of St Enclydwyn (probably the same as St Clydwyn or Cledwyn, a 6th- century saint, the eldest son of Brychan Brycheiniog and brother of St Tudful), this church fell into ruin following the Reformation. The existing font is 12th century and from the earliest church. The discovery of the slabs on the site and the large enclosure of the church that is now the graveyard (about 100 m by 75 m), suggests there was a religious community here, probably a clas. It has been suggested that Iorwerth ab Owain Gwynedd (1145-1174), also known as Iorwerth Drwyndwn, the father of Llywelyn the Great, was buried in the oldest church, and that a sixth stone slab in the present church (a 13th century gravestone) marked his grave. The church is kept locked; the key can be obtained by asking at a neighbouring house. The holy well of St Tudclud is in the cellar of the old Post Office, now a private dwelling. ==Other significant associations== Penmachno briefly featured during the revolt of Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294‚Äì95 as the place where Madog signed the so-called Penmachno Document, the only surviving direct evidence for the rebel leader's use of the title of Prince of Wales. About 3 km north-east of the village centre(), close to the disused 19th century, water-powered Machno Woollen Mill (Glandwr Factory or Factory Isaf)(Inspecting a blanket made at the factory, 1952) built in 1839, there is a drystone-built, packhorse bridge over the Machno river. This is known as the 'Roman Bridge' but it is actually 16th or 17th century. Penmachno is, however, near the section of the Sarn Helen Roman road from Betws-y-Coed to the Roman fort of Tomen y Mur near Trawsfynydd; this road became part of the Cistercian Way between Aberconwy Abbey and Cymer Abbey which also passed near Ysbyty Ifan. A mountain bike trail has been built at Gwydyr Forest in Penmachno. It consists of a 20 km loop with an optional 10 km extension. There are parking facilities on the site. The village was used as a special stage in the 2013 Wales Rally GB. ==Gallery== File:A view of Penmachno from the Machno Hotel NLW3363857.jpgView from the Machno Hotel looking NW towards St Tudclud Church with the bridge in the foreground (about 1875) File:Penmachno NLW3361496.jpgView of Penmachno looking SW towards the Bethania Chapel (about 1875) File:The Old Shop, Penmachno. - geograph.org.uk - 146427.jpgGethin Square, Penmachno, with the old corner shop File:Penmachno Parish Church - geograph.org.uk - 756583.jpgSt Tudclud Parish Church, Penmachno File:Bridge, Afon Machno - geograph.org.uk - 34407.jpg\\"Roman Bridge\\", Afon Machno File:Penmachno woollen mill - geograph.org.uk - 174448.jpgMachno Woollen Mill File:Sarn Helen near Betws.jpgThe Roman road between Betws-y-Coed and Penmachno ==References *Penmachno.net: Tourism site for the village *Photos of Penmachno and surrounding area *Photos of the interior of St Tudclud's Church, the 12th century font and the early Christian stone slabs *of the 13th century grave stone and the early Christian stone slabs *Photo of Penmachno Woolen Mill Shop in 1964 *Photo of interior of Penmachno Woolen Mill Category:Bro Machno Category:Villages in Conwy County Borough Category:Villages in Snowdonia Category:Rally GB ","title":"Penmachno"},{"id":"7447098","text":"George Gatis (born 25 March 1978 in Townsville, Queensland) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 2000s, he played in the National Rugby League and Super League competitions.

It is served by Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner and Southwest Chief trains, as well as Metrolink's 91 Line and Orange County Line trains. It is also a major bus depot for the Orange County Transportation Authority, and is one of the major transportation hubs of Orange County. ==History== The station has two historic depots on site: one built in 1923 by the Union Pacific Railroad, and the other built in 1930 by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. Both depots are on the National Register of Historic Places. The 1930 Santa Fe depot serves as an Amtrak ticket office and passenger waiting area and has a cafe. It features Spanish Colonial Revival style architecture, as evidenced by the stuccoed walls, red tile roof, and decorative wrought ironwork. The Union Pacific Railroad was the third railway to lay tracks through Fullerton and to build a depot. This helped firmly establish Fullerton as the regional rail center for northern Orange County. The 1923 Mission Revival style building was designed by John and Donald Parkinson.Utahrails.net: Union Pacific's Parkinson Depots Fullerton's redevelopment agency moved the station next to the Santa Fe depot in 1980 to preserve it. Today it is occupied by an Old Spaghetti Factory restaurant. In September 1983, the Orange County Transit District (now the Orange County Transportation Authority) opened the Fullerton Transportation Center bus depot which is located across the street from the station which is served by OCTA routes 26, 43, 47, 143, 213 and 543. This station became one of the original 9 stations on the Metrolink Orange County Line when it opened on March 28, 1994 and also one of the original 7 stations when the 91 Line (now the 91/Perris Valley Line) opened on May 6, 2002. In the late 1990s, the Fullerton Railway Plaza Association (FRPA) began fundraising and lobbying for the creation of an interactive railroad attraction or museum at the site, while continuing preservation efforts. Starting in 1999 the Amtrak station and the FRPA were hosts for the annual \\"Fullerton Railroad Days\\" event at the Santa Fe depot, an event that attracted between 30,000 and 40,000 participants. Due to the city not supporting the FRPA museum, Railroad Days was not held in 2009, and FRPA looked elsewhere, choosing to hold its 2010 event in neighboring Brea. The organization subsequently changed its name to the Southern California Railway Plaza Association (SCRPA). However, Railroad Days for 2020 was cancelled in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Service== The station is served by the Metrolink 91 Line and Orange County Line commuter rail services, plus Amtrak intercity Pacific Surfliner and long-distance Southwest Chief services however, all Southwest Chief trains going to Los Angeles stops only to discharge passengers while trains going to Chicago stops only to pick up passengers. The BNSF San Bernardino Subsidivision has three tracks through the station. Westbound passenger trains use the north track and its side platform; eastbound trains use the south track and side platform. The center track is for freight use only. An additional siding track with a side platform south of the mainline tracks is used for short turn trains that run between Fullerton and Laguna Niguel or Oceanside. ==References* * City of Fullerton: official Fullerton Transportation Center website *Great American Stations (Amtrak): Fullerton (FUL) Category:Buildings and structures in Fullerton, California Category:Amtrak stations in Orange County, California Category:Bus stations in Orange County, California Category:Metrolink stations in Orange County, California Category:Transportation in Fullerton, California Category:Former Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway stations in California Category:Former Union Pacific Railroad stations in California Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1923 Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1930 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Orange County, California Category:Railway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:1930s architecture in the United States Category:John and Donald Parkinson buildings Category:Mission Revival architecture in California Category:Spanish Colonial Revival architecture in California Category:1923 establishments in California Category:Proposed California High-Speed Rail stations ","title":"Fullerton Transportation Center"},{"id":"7447116","text":"A Spanish diplomat who saved the lives of hundreds of French Jews as the Nazis advanced on Paris, honoured at Yad Vashem, March 2008. Eduardo Propper de Callej√≥n (Madrid, 9 April 1895 ‚Äì London, 11 January 1972) was a Spanish diplomat who is mainly remembered for having facilitated the escape of thousands of Jews from occupied France during World War II between 1940 and 1944. He was the father-in-law of British banker Raymond Bonham Carter and the maternal grandfather of British actress Helena Bonham Carter. ==Career== Propper de Callej√≥n was First Secretary of the Spanish Embassy in Paris, when France surrendered to Nazi Germany on 20 June 1940. In order to prevent the Wehrmacht from plundering the art collection that his wife's family kept at the Ch√¢teau de Royaumont, he declared this castle to be his main residence, so it would be treated in the same privileged way as the accommodation of any other diplomat. Among the art works thus saved are a triptych of Van Eyck (one of Adolf Hitler's favourite painters). In July 1940, he issued from the Spanish Consulate in Bordeaux, in co-operation with the Portuguese Consul Aristides de Sousa Mendes, more than 30,000 transit visas to Jews, so that they could cross Spain to reach Portugal. When Spain's Foreign Minister Ram√≥n Serrano Su√±er learnt that Propper de Callej√≥n was issuing visas without prior authorization, he had him transferred to the Consulate of Larache in the Spanish protectorate in Morocco. Afterwards, he would be posted to Rabat, Zurich, Washington D.C., Ottawa and Oslo. ==Miscellaneous== Propper de Callej√≥n's father, Maximilian \\"Max\\" Propper, was a Bohemian Jew; and his mother, Juana de Callej√≥n, was a Spanish Catholic. They raised him as well as his brothers in the Catholic faith. His wife, H√©l√®ne Fould-Springer, was a socialite and painter. She was from a notable Jewish French-Austrian banking family, the daughter of Baron Eug√®ne Fould-Springer (a French banker, who was descended from the Ephrussi family and the Fould dynasty) and Marie Cecile von Springer (whose father was Austrian-born industrialist Baron Gustav von Springer, and whose mother was from the de Koenigswarter family). She converted to Catholicism after World War II. Her sister was prominent Paris art patron and philanthropist Liliane de Rothschild (Baroness √âlie de Rothschild, 1916‚Äì2003) of the prominent Rothschild family (who had also married within the von Springer family in the 19th century). He never gained public recognition for his heroic acts before his death in 1972 in London, following an operation. In 2008, he was officially recognised as a Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem, the Holocaust remembrance authority in Israel. This was accomplished by the testimony of Austrian Archduke Otto von Habsburg who had disclosed his knowledge of Propper de Callej√≥n's actions at the Nazi occupation of France during an interview with Felix Pfeifle for the film Felix Austria (2012). ==ReferencesCategory:1895 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Spanish diplomats Category:Spanish people of Jewish descent Category:Spanish people of Czech descent Category:Spanish Roman Catholics Category:Spanish Righteous Among the Nations Category:Catholic Righteous Among the Nations Category:Holocaust survivors Category:Fould family ","title":"Eduardo Propper de Callej√≥n"},{"id":"7447125","text":"Quicksales (typeset as quicksales) was an online auction site based in Australia, and the second largest auction website in Australia.http://www.girl.com.au/oztion-animal-rescue-auctions.htm Girl.com.au OZtion Animal Rescue auctions article At one point there were more than 1.8 million items available for auction or purchase and over 515,000 member accounts.

The agency has its headquarters in the province's capital city Bolzano. RAS is not related to the regional trilingual programme of RAI, the Italian public broadcaster. ==History== When television broadcasts began, the German-speaking population of South Tyrol asked for the reception of the Austrian television station but it wasn't possible because RAI has the monopoly to have radio and television stations. In 1966 the Italian Government in Rome created the German-speaking broadcast of RAI from Bolzano called Rai S√ºdtirol (back then Rai Sender Bozen) but the German-speaking population just wanted to have the possibility to watch the television station from Austria and perceived the offer from Rome suspiciously. The German-speaking broadcast of the government-owned RAI was seen as a way to control the process of autonomy in the province. The provincial autonomy for South Tyrol in 1972 promised to create an agency whose purpose was to relay programmes from Austria and other German-speaking countries. The autonomous statute says that: The Province shall have the power to issue laws on local artistic, cultural and educational events and activities, and also through the media of radio and television, but without the power to set up radio and television stations. The RAS nowadays owns all antenna towers in South Tyrol and has worked for the digitization of its broadcasting system. RAS cooperates with the local civil protection corps to give information to the people of South Tyrol in case of emergency. ==Organization== RAS is a public company which is formed by a board elected for 2/3 by the Government of the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol. According to the agency the RAS employs 26 workers. While the Italian public broadcaster RAI is funded by licence fees and advertising, RAS is completely funded by provincial funds. All the public broadcasters give the possibility to RAS to relay their programmes without any cost (provincial citizens don't have to pay extra license fees). South Tyrol is actually the only province in Italy to have two public broadcasting services operating - the provincial German-language broadcast from RAI and the 6 RAS TV channels. The general director is Helmuth Hendrich. ==ProgrammesTelevision=== RAS relays television stations from the public broadcasters of Austria, Germany and Switzerland in digital terrestrial television using DVB-T. Analogue television was used between 1974 until the completion of the digitization process. Until the completion of the digitization process, the digital-only channels cannot be seen in either analog or vice versa. The network has completed its digitization process which started in 2007 and completed in November 2009. In some areas the terrestrial reception of some channels is not possible.

Green was the eighteenth African-American Article III judge appointed in the United States, and the second African-American judge on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. During his 36 years on the federal bench Judge Green presided over a number of notable cases, and was regarded as one of the most popular judges in the district.Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, Volume 1, Prentice Hall Law and Business, 1994. ==Personal life== Judge Green was born on April 2, 1923 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father, Robert Lewis Green, had come to the United States from St. Thomas island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Interview with The Honorable Clifford Scott Green, for the Historical Society of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, December 2, 2004. Green attended West Philadelphia High School, graduating in 1941.Judge Green's Biography from Biography of Federal Judges, a publication of the Federal Judicial Center. He initially had \\"no thought of going to college,\\" intending instead to go immediately to work. From 1941 to 1942 he worked in a Philadelphia restaurant and at a drug manufacturing company. In 1942 he took a job with the United States Army Signal Corps. In 1943 Judge Green enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps, the predecessor to the United States Air Force. At the time, the armed forces were still segregated. Green was initially \\"optimistic that the military was going to be a good life,\\" until his unit was shipped from Fort Lee, Virginia to Keesler Field (now Keesler Air Force Base), in Mississippi. When the unit arrived at Keesler they were driven past the barracks to what Green would later describe as \\"a tent city.\\" It was then that Green \\"realized for real that I was really in a segregated army, and there was always, as long as I was in the service, two standards, one quite unacceptable and the other as acceptable as could be considering the fact that the country was at war.\\" Green served from 1943 to 1946, rising to the rank of Sergeant. He returned to Philadelphia in March 1946, intending to use the benefits of the G.I. Bill to attend Drexel University. He planned to major in electrical engineering, which was the field he had worked in during his time in the Army. Drexel did not have classes starting until September, so Green began to look to work. While seeking employment at Temple University Green learned that Temple had classes beginning in two weeks, so he decided to enroll there. Green entered the School of Business as an economics major, and planned to become a certified public accountant, until an adviser told him that there were no jobs available for African-American accountants in Philadelphia. Green decided to pursue a career in law, something his father had dreamed of doing himself. Green received a B.S. in economics in 1948, finishing his undergraduate degree in just over two years and graduating with honors.Answer to Personal Data Questionnaire of the Judiciary Committee of the Philadelphia Bar Association. He enrolled at Temple Law School as one of ten black students, of whom two would ultimately graduate (the other graduate, Larry Perkins, would also go on to become a judge). While in law school Green was a member of the moot court team and the law review. He competed on a moot court team which won the Philadelphia regional of the American Bar Association competition. At the national competition, Green's team faced the Yale moot court team, which included his future law partner and judicial colleague A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr.. In 1951 Green received his LL.B. with honors, graduating in the top three of his class. He was also awarded graduation prizes for receiving the highest grades in constitutional law and conflicts of law. ==Legal career== Judge Green (second from the left) with his former law partners at his swearing in Green passed the Pennsylvania bar exam in 1951, achieving the highest score in the state. Green's early mentors included Robert N.C. Nix, Sr., who lived across the street from Green's family. In January 1952, after being admitted to the bar, Green took over the practice of Thomas Reed, a black Philadelphia lawyer who was joining the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office under Richardson Dilworth (Green had also interviewed at the DA's office, but decided that he \\"couldn't fit in as a prosecutor\\"). Green worked as a solo practitioner until March 1952, when he entered into a partnership with Harvey Schmidt. The firm was known as Schmidt and Green until 1954, when Doris M. Harris and A. Leon Higginbotham joined as partners. In 1955 J. Austin Norris, a prominent African-American political figure, joined the firm, which was then known as Norris, Schmidt, Green, Harris, & Higginbotham. The firm was the first African-American law firm in Philadelphia.The Norris Schmidt Firm: The Social Impact of a Complex Professional Philadelphia Institution, Aaron Porter, 1994. The firm, which never numbered more than a dozen lawyers at a given time, produced four federal judges; Higginbotham, Green, and Herbert Hutton all served on the District Court (Higginbotham was later elevated to the Third Circuit), and William Hall was the first African American appointed as a federal magistrate judge. In addition, two members of the firm, Dorris Harris and Harvey Schmidt, were elected judges of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, and William Brown was appointed by President Nixon to be chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Green's practice while at the firm was diverse. Initially, the firm's practice was primarily criminal defense. As new partners were added, the firm expanded to include civil work, which eventually became the overwhelming majority of the work. Green eventually developed a specialized practice representing churches, including the National Baptist Convention, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith, and Father Divine. Additionally, Green represented parties both before and after the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education in an attempt to integrate both the student and teacher populations in area school districts. He remained with the firm until his appointment to the bench. Green first entered public service as a special deputy commonwealth attorney general from 1954 to 1955. He was assigned as counsel for the Director of the Bureau of Workman's Compensation. In addition to representing the Director, Green was also responsible for approving all claims for compensation under the occupational disease statute whenever the Commonwealth was involved. In 1954 Green unsuccessfully ran for the Republican nomination for Philadelphia City Council. ==Judicial career== Green was initially hesitant about seeking a position on the bench because he enjoyed the practice of law. Nevertheless, he began to seek an appointment to the state court in the late 1950s. Green was a lifelong member of the Republican party, serving as a ward leader from the 1952 to 1964.Biographical Sketch of Clifford Scott Green. Green's first attempt to gain a seat on the bench was in 1959, when he was unanimously endorsed by the Republican party for a seat on the Municipal Court, but lost in the general election. In 1962 Green joined with a group of Republican ward leaders who broke off from the main party, which was led by Sheriff Austin Meehan, to support Governor William Scranton. All of the other ward leaders were voted out of office, and although Green retained his position Sheriff Meehan told him that he would no longer support his appointment to the bench. Judge Green with Senators Hugh Scott and Richard Schweiker Green, however, had the support of Bernard G. Segal, who was then Chancellor of the Philadelphia Bar Association, his former law partner Austin Norris, and the Chancellor of Temple University Robert Johnson. Segal was appointed by Governor Scranton to head a merit commission to select nominees for the state court positions. In addition, Green was endorsed by newspapers across the state.\\"Boost Clifford Green for Local Judgeship\\", The Philadelphia Independent.\\"Green Boomed for Philly Judgeship\\", The Pittsburgh Courier. Scranton ultimately did appoint Green as a judge on the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia in 1964. He was elected to a full term in the next general election. Green served primarily as a juvenile court judge while in state court. In 1971 a vacancy was created on the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania when Judge Harold K. Wood assumed senior status. Senator Hugh Scott supported Green to fill the position. Green also had the support of Billy Meehan, the son of Sheriff Austin Meehan, and at the time the head of the Philadelphia Republican Committee. President Nixon nominated Green on December 1, 1971, and he was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 4, receiving his commission on December 9. In 1984 Green declined a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, citing \\"the joy his district court job provided him and [the] numerous friendships he enjoyed there.\\"Green noted for compassion: Trailblazing Judge was 84, The Philadelphia Tribune, Jennifer Phillips and Eric Mayes, June 6, 2007. He assumed senior status on April 2, 1988, and continued serving in that capacity until his death. Throughout his time on the bench, Green remained a popular judge; a 1994 survey of Philadelphia lawyers concluded \\"Green is the most well-liked judge on the bench, and attorneys could not praise him enough for his wonderful demeanor.\\" ===Notable cases=== Judge Green presided over a number of notable cases during his 35-year tenure on the Eastern District. In Bolden v. Pennsylvania State Police Judge Green ordered the Pennsylvania State Police to reinstate William Bolden, a minority trooper who had been dismissed.Bolden v. Pennsylvania State Police, 73 F.R.D. 370 (E.D.Pa. 1976). The case, which began in 1973, resulted in a consent decree that required the State Police to hire one minority for every non-minority hired, and set additional goals for promotion and retention of minority troopers. Judge Green presided over the consent decree for 25 years, dissolving it in 1999.Bolden v. Pennsylvania State Police, 79 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 63 (E.D.Pa. 1999). The case was credited with helping to abolish racism in the hiring of troopers, and integrate the State Police.Judge Clifford Scott Green dies, Philadelphia Daily News, June 2, 2007. In 1981 Judge Green threw out the fraud conviction of Pennsylvania State Senator Vincent Fumo,United States v. Camiel, 519 F. Supp. 1238 (E.D.Pa. 1981) concluding that the government had failed to prove that Fumo and two others were involved in a single scheme to pad state payrolls with ghost workers as alleged in their indictment. The decision was upheld on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.United States v. Camiel, 689 F.2d 31 (3rd Cir. 1982). ==Awards and honors== Judge Green was the first recipient of the NAACP's William H. Hastie award in 1985. He was awarded the Spirit of Excellence award by the American Bar Association in 2002. The Philadelphia chapter of the Judicial Council of the National Bar Association is named in Judge Green's honor. The Criminal Law Committee of the Federal Bar Association's Philadelphia Chapter gives a Clifford Scott Green Bill of Rights Award at its biennial dinner event. Judge Green was a lifetime trustee of Temple University, and a former member of the Board of Trustees of Philadelphia State Hospital, and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ==Death== Judge Green suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died of pneumonia in Philadelphia on May 31, 2007.

It is bordered by the town of Linwood to the west and Glasgow Airport to the north. Ferguslie Park has history of being among the most deprived communities in Scotland. Attempts have been made at regeneration despite significant challenges. ==History== Ferguslie has origins dating back to the 16th century, and was the site of a large estate associated with the monks based at Paisley. The modern town, however, was born in the 1850s around an iron-stone mining settlement known as Inkerman. At its closure, the town was demolished and its residents moved to Ferguslie or nearby Elderslie. Its main form was gained following the Housing Act of 1949. It was hit particularly hard by the closure of traditional industries particularly based in nearby Linwood in the late 1970s and early 1980s. As a consequence, and also due to its isolated position separated from Paisley and other towns by railway lines and other transport networks, it has suffered a large degree of social exclusion. In particular, it has become known for drug abuse, appearing on a Panorama television programme in the late 1990s relating to the problems this has caused. It has also had severe problems with crime and juvenile delinquency. Preliminary steps in the regeneration of Ferguslie Park is currently underway. 'Neighbourhood wardens' now patrol the streets to give a visible presence to try to deter crime. Graffiti Squads also aim to remove graffiti from council property within 24 hours to try to reduce the urban decay, with a main focus over recent years on a graffiti artist under the name 'Probs'. However the drug problem and anti- social behavior still exists, although to a lesser extent than in recent years. The Tannahill Centre, named after the poet Robert Tannahill, a weaver from the town of Paisley, aims to give a nice community centre and shopping area. The centre, however has locals complaining that the chemist located inside the post office, is often giving drug addicts the heroin substitute Methadone whilst vulnerable pensioners are collecting pension money. Community projects, such as Ferguslie Park Radio have been successful in helping some youngsters channel their enthusiasm into worthwhile events, and sports facilities exist in the area for 5 a side football. To the east, new housing has been joined by the commercial development, the Phoenix Centre, which contains a cinema, car dealerships, restaurants, shops and supermarkets, in order to regenerate the former Chrysler car plant that used to be on the site. Whilst regarded as being in Linwood, it is more accurately in Paisley, and joins the Ferguslie Park area- Linwood is in fact further away on the other side of the Johnstone By-Pass. In 2006, the Scottish Executive named it as one of Scotland's most deprived communities. This information was based on paperwork dating back to 1996. To the east, St Mirren F.C., the local team of the town of Paisley who play in the Scottish Premiership, moved in January 2009 from their traditional Love Street home some 600 m away from a new all- seater stadium on vacant ground near the current St. James Station. This involved selling Love Street to a supermarket chain and it was given planning permission by Renfrewshire Council in 2005 for both the new stadium and supermarket plans. However, in 2012 the \\"Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation\\" analysis by the Scottish Government again identified Ferguslie Park as the most deprived area in Scotland.Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2012: Key findings There was a slight improvement in 2019, with the community the third most deprived area, almost four decades after the Linewood auto plant was closed. (The term \\"deprivation\\" refers not only to low income according to the BBC, but may also include \\"fewer resources and opportunities, for example in health and education\\".) A BBC report states that the most significant problem for the Council was the \\"half-abandoned Tannahill scheme\\", an area with derelict homes, but regeneration funding of ¬£6m had already been scheduled; it would be used to build just over a hundred affordable houses. ==Location and transport== Ferguslie Park is at the north- west extremity of Paisley in Renfrewshire, Scotland. It is bordered by the town of Linwood to the west and Glasgow Airport to the north. To the North the Inverclyde-to-Glasgow Railway line separates the residential area from the industrial areas to the North East of Ferguslie Park. Paisley St James railway station, is located on the line near Greenhill Road, however the scale of the urban decay is evident on the station with its high security, only one train per hour calls, and many flats that were near the station no longer exist. The Glasgow Airport Rail Link will see the current station close and move closer to the centre of Ferguslie Park, as the rail link to the airport will require a junction where the station is located. St James's Park, known locally as the Racecourse, a recreation ground to the south of the M8, is a popular football venue for amateur teams. This area has avoided many of the problems of Ferguslie Park and is still fairly well used, with many businesses, in particular long stay car parks for the nearby airport. 2 bus services run through the area, one links the area to the Phoenix Centre and Paisley Town Centre, and the other by transport giant Arriva, links the area with Paisley Cross. An indicator of the crime level, no company operates past 18:30, despite the low car use. ==Notable people== * Joe Egan (singer/songwriter) of the band Stealers Wheel.

His position of preference was as a fullback. ==Playing careerEarly years=== Educated at St Dominic's College, Penrith, Terra Sancta College and Westfields Sports High School McKinnon played rugby league from a young age. A St Clair Comets junior, McKinnon made his first grade d√©but with the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2002 following their re-admittance into the competition. ===Parramatta Eels=== After two years at South Sydney, McKinnon moved to Parramatta. In 2004, during his first season with the Eels, he won the Jack Gibson Award and the Ron Lynch Media Award in the same season. In 2005, McKinnon was part of the Parramatta side which won the minor premiership but fell short of a grand final appearance losing 29-0 to North Queensland in the preliminary final.https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/eels/nathan- hindmarsh-on-parramattas-last-table-topping-team-where-his-former-teammates- are-now/news-story/fea0ebc7740f2dbbf8884bae9db77210 ===New Zealand Warriors=== With the Eels making it clear that they preferred Luke Burt ahead of the off- contract McKinnon, McKinnon often found it tough to make the first-grade team when the Eels were at full-strength. Consequently, he signed a three-year deal with the Warriors in 2007, filling in the void that was to be left by the departing Brent Webb. McKinnon cited the Warriors' style of play as being conducive to the game. Mckinnon became the 132nd first grade player for the Warriors when he made his d√©but against the Eels, his former club, at Mt Smart Stadium in Round 1, 2007. McKinnon scored 9 tries in his first season with the club. During his time at the Warriors McKinnon was involved in several incidents. In a Round 19 match in 2007, McKinnon was sent off by referee Paul Simpkins in the final minute of play for allegedly kneeing Taniela Tuiaki. The replay, however, suggested there was no contact or intent, and consequently he was not cited after the match. McKinnon playing for the New Zealand Warriors in 2009 McKinnon's individual try against the Penrith Panthers in Round Fifteen 2007 was voted as the greatest of the year by NRL.com. McKinnon was ruled out of most of the 2008 NRL Season after an injury in the Warriors first trial game against the Newcastle Knights left him requiring a knee reconstruction. However McKinnon recovered relatively quickly and he made his return against the Brisbane Broncos in Round 22. He celebrated this game by scoring a try in a 16-12 Warriors win. In Round 25, 2008, McKinnon was suspended for three matches after allegedly spitting at touch-judge Brett Suttor. Suttor said that the spit landed 30 centimetres away from him, but the judiciary said that as McKinnon was at least six metres away from him, it was not possible for his spit to travel that far. He was selected for City in the City vs Country match on 8 May 2009. ===Wests Tigers=== After struggling to break into the Warriors 2010 team as he failed to regain his speed from his knee injury, McKinnon signed for the Wests Tigers on 26 May 2010. McKinnon had been contracted to the Warriors until the end of 2011 but was granted an immediate release by the Warriors.McKinnon granted release from contract Warriors.co.nz, 26 May 2010 McKinnon played his first game for the Tigers in round 15, but was limited to 6 games for the season due to a hamstring injury.

It was later ported to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. A manga illustrated by Hoehoe N≈çmiso was serialized in Dengeki Daioh between the November 2005 and May 2007 issues. A 12-episode anime adaptation titled Yoake Mae yori Ruriiro na: Crescent Love aired in Japan between October and December 2006. The anime is licensed by Sentai Filmworks in North America and was released on June 1, 2010. ==Gameplay== Yoake Mae yori Ruriiro na is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Tatsuya Asagiri. Its gameplay requires little player interaction as much of the game's duration is spent on reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story's narrative and dialogue. The text is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Tatsuya is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites. Yoake Mae yori Ruriiro na follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are seven main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Every so often, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from multiple options. Text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. After the completion of the six heroine routes, the final scenario called Yoake Mae yori Ruriiro na is made available. Throughout gameplay, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Tatsuya and a given heroine having sex. ==Plot== Yoake Mae yori Ruriiro na centers on Princess Feena Fam Earthlight from the Kingdom of Sphere on Earth's moon. It was decided that she was to live on Earth in a homestay with the family of the primary secretary to the president of the United Nations so as to get more knowledgeable of Earth in order to better prepare herself for her succession as the Kingdom of Sphere's next queen. The background of the story explains that humans landed on the moon long ago intending to create a new home for themselves called the Kingdom of Sphere. However, the relations between Earth and the Kingdom have worsened things and a war called the Oedipus war started. Once the war was over, it was decided that the city of Mitsurugasaki in Shizuoka Prefecture of Japan, where the story takes place, under the rule of the United Nations, be developed as the center of diplomacy with the Lunar Kingdom, which, currently, has closed its doors to the world. This central lunar junction port city, which has the only spaceport within the United Nations with ships going to and coming from the Lunar Embassy, is, as its name suggests, the gateway which connects the Earth and the moon. Although tensions have temporarily eased now, relations between the two worlds is still in a situation when the story begins where caution must still be taken. ==CharactersMain characters=== ; : (Drama CD) / Susumu Chiba (anime) :Tatsuya is the main male protagonist in the story.

Eventually, the DVD version of the anime was given a smoother look and visibly better animation (albeit without a change in storyline). The aforementioned badly-drawn cabbage was also redrawn correctly. Episodes { width=\\"98%\\" - ! # !! Title !!

The opposite of heterosociality is homosociality. At an institutional level, the spread of heterosociality, epitomized by the entrance of women into public life/space, is closely associated with the progress of modernization.Ben Singer, Melodrama and Modernity (2001) p. 21 == Terminology == The term heterosocial can refer to either: * an individual who prefers to befriend or socialize with the opposite sex, as opposed to homosocial (preferring same-sex social relations) or bisocial (enjoying social relations with both sexes) * a social relationship between two people who are of different sexes, as opposed to homosocial (of the same sex). Whether the term can be applied to groups of three or more people has been disputed. One possible argument is that such a group is homosocial if composed of people of a single sex, and bisocial if composed of people of both sexes, since in the latter case each member will be interacting with people of both sexes. On the other hand, Collins English Dictionary defines heterosocial as \\"relating to or denoting mixed-sex social relationships\\", without specification of whether it applies to relationships between two people or among larger groups, suggesting that the term can describe social interactions involving people of both sexes more generally. ==Historical developments== The pervasiveness of heterosociality in contemporary life can lead to the obscuring of its social construction as a late development in Western history. Writing of early society, Freud considered that there was \\"an unmistakable tendency to keep the sexes apart. Women live with women, men with men\\".Sigmund Freud, On Sexuality (PFL 7) p. 271 Durkheim associated sexual totemism, binding men and women into two separate totemic corporations, with such a social division of the sexes.Emile Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1971) p. 165-6 Even in the twentieth century, rules of etiquette in some traditional villages dictated that men and women do not greet each other when passing in public.Erving Goffman, Relations in Public (1971) p. 122 Urbanization and modernization have seen a gradual erosion of the barriers to male/female socialising, not without significant culture wars along the way over each particular new arena. Thus, for example, part of the hostility to the Elizabethan theatre lay in the fact that men and women freely intermingled in its audience;Stephen Greenblatt, Will in the World (2005) p. 186 while dance halls and cabarets later offered similarly controversial new areas for heterosocial interaction,Mark P. Holt, Alcohol: A Social and Cultural History (2006) p. 152 as too did amusement parks.Kathy Peiss, Cheap Amusements (1987) p. 136 In the 21st century, the challenge presented to traditional societies by the way the discourse of modernity encourages heterosociality over an older homosociality continues to be a live issue.N. Naghibi, Rethinking Global Sisterhood (2007) p. 110 ==Impact on feminism== The 20th century opening up of the public sphere to womenJennifer Craig, The Face of Fashion (1994) p. 178‚Äîwork, politics, culture, education‚Äîboth fuelled, and was fed by, the feminist movement; but the increase in heterosociality which accompanied it was seen as double-edged by many feminists. On the one hand, it served to undercut older feminist homosocial bonds and support systems;Susan Layleff, Wash and be Healed (1991) p. 162 on the other, it split the new feminist movement, as calls for separatist feminism challenged heterosociality, let alone heterosexuality,Sylvia Walby, The Future of Feminism (2011) p. 3 in ways many found unacceptable. Post-feminism has generally accepted heterosociality, along with a new strategy of gender mainstreaming, but not without reservations as to the exploitative aspects of (for example) raunch culture within the new 21st century public gender regime.Walby, p. 20 and p. 88 ==Adolescence== Acquiring heterosocial competence is a key adolescent task.R. J. R. Levesque, Encyclopedia of Adolescence (2011) p. 1302 Other-sex friendships, even more than romances, can play a key role in this process.Levesque, p. 1297-9 Different societies and different subcultures place varying restrictions upon adolescent heterosocial roles and opportunities.Erving Goffman, Relations in Public (1972) p. 269‚Äì70 American teen culture in particular has been seen as aggressively promoting heterosociality over homosociality.R. Wilson/D. Lavery, Fighting the Forces (2002) p. 49‚Äì51 ==Culture== The advancement of culture was seen by Henry James as linked to heterosociality.Beverly Havilland, Henry James's Last Romance (1997) p. 168 Similarly, Kenneth Clark saw the flourishing of 18th-century French culture as rooted in the heterosociality of the salon.Kenneth Clark, Civilisation (1969) p. 251-8 ==Artistic conflicts== * Postfeminist criticism of Buffy Summers as powerful female role model has centred on the heterosocial nature of her particular universe of social networks.Lorna Jowett, Sex and The Slayer (2005) p. 50 Cross-sex relationships play a predominant part in the Buffy world, foreclosing more politicised readingsWilcox, p. 49 and p. 60 from a feminist viewpoint. * Virginia Woolf wrote an early essay on the pleasures of heterosociality‚Äîof finding \\"much to say to each other which neither would say to a person of the same sex\\".Quoted in Hermione Lee, Virginia Woolf (1996) p. 248 The Bloomsbury group as a whole can be seen as a heterosocial construct, formed in opposition to the more segregated sexual worlds of the late nineteenth century.Lee, p. 161 and p. 266 ==See also== *Cross-sex friendship *Coed *Compulsory heterosexuality *Gender roles *Human bonding *Platonic love *Romantic friendship *Romantic orientation ==References== Category:Gender and society Category:Queer theory Category:LGBT and society Category:Sociological terminology ","title":"Heterosociality"},{"id":"7447281","text":"Black Water is a 1992 novella by Joyce Carol Oates. ==Plot summary== The book begins with Kelly Kelleher in a car that is plunging into mucky, swampy, \\"black water.\\" We learn the events that led up to the accident in flashbacks as she is drowning: Kelly Kelleher attends a Fourth of July party hosted by her friend Buffy St. John and her lover, Ray Annick. She is planning to stay with them for the weekend. Buffy is the \\"more worldly\\" of the two young women; the irony in this is that it is completely out of character for Kelly to get herself into such a situation. Ray has invited \\"The Senator\\" about whom Kelly wrote her graduate thesis. He immediately is interested in her sexually; he pays attention solely to her as the party drags on, and they discuss their common political beliefs. He follows her to the beach where he kisses her, and then invites her to come to his hotel with him on the ferry. As she packs her bags, Buffy tries to convince her not to go or to go later but Kelly thinks that this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance and goes with him, despite the fact that he has been drinking and that she is not entirely sure that she is \\"ready\\" for any sort of relationship. The Senator is drunk and takes the \\"old\\" Ferry Road instead of the \\"new\\" one; he is driving recklessly and drives directly through a guardrail into a marsh. We find later that, had he made the turn, the car probably would have fallen into the water a short distance down the road at an old bridge. The car sinks passenger side-down. At this point, The Senator uses Kelly's body to jettison himself upwards, out of the driver's side door. She tries to hold on to him to pull herself free; he kicks her, leaving his shoe in her hand. Kelly, badly injured and delirious, continually imagines that he will come back to \\"save\\" her, and also that he has gone for help. She repeatedly imagines seeing him outside of the car, or that she feels the car shaking as he tries to get her out. She trusts The Senator until the very end of her life, certain that he will save her; it is possible that, because of this, she misses out on highly important lucid moments in which she could possibly save herself. In reality, The Senator has stumbled to an outdoor phone booth, carefully staying out of sight of passing cars, to call Ray Annick. He tells Annick that Kelly became emotional and pushed the wheel because she was drunk, thus causing the accident, and that she is already dead. Meanwhile, Kelly is following an ever-shrinking bubble of air to the top of the car. She panics and imagines that she is rescued and sent to the hospital where the \\"black water\\" is pumped from her stomach; this parallels an episode from college in which a suitemate tried to kill herself and had to have her stomach pumped. Kelly gets her imagery of the experience from the description of the other girl. The reader also learns about Kelly's own bout with suicidal thought and depression, triggered by the end of a relationship; she has decided that she wants her life, that she wants to live, and this was part of the reason she decided to leave the party with The Senator in the first place. She also repeatedly imagines her parents, and how she will explain to them that she is a \\"good girl\\" and argues that The Senator and his wife are separated, his children grown, and that their affair is causing no harm. She remembers an article she wrote arguing against the death penalty in which she details the more gruesome and torturous aspects of different methods of execution; this underscores the cruelty and horror of her death. As she grows closer and closer to death, her hallucinations become more vivid until she is imagining her parents, very old, watching her being pulled from the water in horror. She imagines herself as a child reaching up to be carried. The book ends with a line that is repeated throughout the book: \\"As the black water filled her lungs, and she died.\\" ==Characters== * Elizabeth Anne Kelleher, a.k.a. Kelly Kelleher. The protagonist. She works for a magazine, Citizen's Inquiry. She wrote her thesis on The Senator. She is twenty-six years old, and suffers from acne and anorexia. * The Senator, a Democratic US Senator. He is hard of hearing, an aggressive driver, tall, and likes to drink.

Bush and Ronald Reagan are both castigated in the narrative,Presidents are referenced in Chapters 12 and 15, respectively. while Bobby Kennedy and the Vietnam War are referred to as representing the cushy Democratic era.The Democratic era is referenced Chapter 9. In Chapter 24, the Senator mentions the 1991 Gulf War. The Beatles song \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" (1966) plays on the radio in Chapter 9, echoing the prosody of the novella. The Education of Henry Adams (1907) is quoted in Chapter 32. The story parallels the 1969 Chappaquiddick accident, in which Mary Jo Kopechne drowned. In a New York Times interview, the author said she began making notes for \\"a novel\\" in 1969, after Oates felt \\"a horrified fascination and sympathy\\" for the victim, who was in the car driven by Senator Edward Kennedy. (\\"But Ms. Oates insists 'Black Water' is not about Chappaquiddick per se. 'I wanted the story to be somewhat mythical, the almost archetypal experience of a young woman who trusts an older man and whose trust is violated.'\\") ==Literary significance and criticism== Black Water was a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist in 1992, and was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in 1993. The Rocky Mountain News, The Times, and Entertainment Weekly have all listed Black Water as one of Joyce Carol Oates's best books.Davis, Duane. \\"Joyce Carol Oates for dummies\\", \\"Where to start\\", \\"Onto the novels\\" (series of articles), The Rocky Mountain News, 2003-06-13.

Oates gave Beck permission to do so, indicating that she herself was creating a libretto for the Duffy project, but noting that their respective approaches would result in very different operatic works. Beck's monodrama was first premiered in a concert version in 1995 at the University of Northern Iowa; it did not receive its stage premiere until April, 2016, in a Center for Contemporary Opera production at Symphony Space's Thalia Theater in New York City.

The institution was born as a rowing club, nevertheless it is mostly known for its football activities nowadays. The team currently plays in Primera C, the fourth division of the Argentine football league system. ==History== Olympic goal\\" by Ces√°reo Onzari, 1924. Primera Divisi√≥n championship in 1932. The club was founded in 1913 in its headquarters still located in the barrio of Barracas in Buenos Aires, as \\"Club Sportivo Barracas\\". The football squad made its debut in the Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n in 1917, finishing 5th.Argentina 1917 at RSSSF The team played in Primera until the league became professional in 1931. Sportivo became one of the clubs to make the decision of staying amateur so it remained at the official body, Argentine Association.Argentina 1931 (amateur) at RSSSF This decision paid dividends because the following year Sportivo Barracas won the 1932 championship. It remained unaffiliated to Argentine Football Association from 1936 to 1967, never regaining its amateur notability since its return. Following an influx of external financial support, the club moved to play its football matches to Bolivar, Buenos Aires Province, in 2003, changing its name to \\"Club Sportivo Barracas Bol√≠var\\", as well as the shirt colors and crest. However, all other activities of the club remained in Buenos Aires.\\"Sportivo hay uno solo\\" In 2010, the club left the city of Bol√≠var, playing its home games at Acassuso stadium of San Isidro, Buenos Aires.\\"Historia de Sportivo Barracas\\" Sportivo Barracas has a major rivalry with Barracas Central, the other team in the Barracas neighbourhood. In March 2011, the club put the image of former President of Argentina N√©stor Kirchner on the jersey as a tribute to him.\\"Presentan una camiseta en homenaje a N√©stor Kirchner\\", Terra, 2011-03-21 In May 2012, Sportivo Barracas was disaffiliated for one season after finishing last in the Primera D championship. The vacant place was filled by Puerto Nuevo which returned to the division. In 2015, Sportivo Barracas won the Primera D championship, promoting to the upper level. ==Stadium== In the 1920s and 1930s the Sportivo Barracas stadium was one of the most important stadiums in Argentina. It held 30,000 spectators and was used as a venue for the South American Championship 1921 and South American Championship 1925. An important anecdotic fact related to the stadium took place on the match between Argentina and Uruguay, on October 2, 1924. In June of that year, Uruguay had attained the Olympic football crown at Paris, which at that moment was a kind of unofficial world title, since the World Cup was not be played until 1930. The rivalry between Argentina and Uruguay was already an important one, so the match generated much expectancy. After the Uruguayan title, two matches were to be played between Uruguay and Argentina. The first one was in Montevideo and finished 1‚Äì1. The second one in Buenos Aires was to be played on September 28, but there were so many people at the stadium that day that the field itself was occupied by supporters. The Uruguayans asked for the suspension of the match and a perimeter to separate people from players on the next encounter, which was finally played on October 2, 1924. That day, before playing the match, the Uruguayans celebrated their Olympic title by circumvallating the field, something described then as la vuelta de los ol√≠mpicos (the round of the Olympic ones), lately just vuelta ol√≠mpica (Olympic round). Argentina won that match 2‚Äì1 (Onzari 1‚Äì0 at 15‚Äô, Cea 1‚Äì1 at 29‚Äô, and Tarasconi 2‚Äì1 at 53‚Äô), but it was Onzari's goal which was to be remembered, because it was converted directly from a corner kick. The International Board had specifically modified the football rules on this point on June 14, 1924, allowing goals to be scored like that. Since then, a goal like Onzari's is referred as a Gol ol√≠mpico or Olympic goal in almost all Latin America, and even some parts of Europe. It is the first time that an Olympic goal is called that way, as well as its the debut of the expression vuelta ol√≠mpica in Latin America.\\"El gol ol√≠mpico cumple 80\\", Clar√≠n, 2004-10-02 Onzari was at that moment playing for Hurac√°n. The field was also used in 1925 for the first boxing fight in open space of Luis √Ångel Firpo. From 2003 to 2010 the club played its home games at the Estadio Municipal de Bol√≠var. ==Honours== * Primera Divisi√≥n (1): 1932 * Copa de Competencia Jockey Club (1): 1921 * Divisi√≥n Intermedia (1): 1916 * Primera C (1): 1919 AAm * Primera D (4): 1931, 1932, 2003‚Äì04, 2015 ==NotesReferences *Sportivo Barracas (fans site) Category:Football clubs in Buenos Aires Category:Association football clubs established in 1913 Category:1913 establishments in Argentina ","title":"Sportivo Barracas"},{"id":"7447317","text":"Finis may refer to: * Fini»ô, a commune in Bihor County, Romania * Fini»ô (river), a river in Bihor County, Romania * \\"Finis\\" (short story), the 1906 science fiction / horror story by Frank L.

It is located mostly around the peninsula in the Western Area of Sierra Leone. The Western Area Rural District has a 2015 census population of 442,951. The district capital and largest city is Waterloo. Other major towns in the district include Newton, Benguema, Leicester, Tombo and Regent. Most of the towns and villages in the Western area rural District are close to the capital Freetown; and are part of the Freetown Metropolitan Area. The Western Area Rural District is bordered by the country's capital Freetown to the east and west; Port Loko District to the north; and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and east. In October 2009, the Sierra Leone government officially moved the Rural District capital from Freetown to the city of Waterloo, after the completion of the newly built government complex for the rural district council. This provides more regional focus. The Western Area Rural District is one of the most ethnically diverse districts in Sierra Leone. No single ethnic group form more than 25% of the population in the District. The district has a significant population of the Krio and Sherbro people. The Western Area Rural District is the only district in Sierra Leone that is home to an ethnic Krio majority town or village, as several villages and a couple of small towns have Krio majority population in the District. There are large proportions of both Muslims and Christians in the district. Like the other fifteen districts of Sierra Leone, the Western Area Rural District has its own directly elected district government, known as a district council, headed by a directly elected district council chairman. This person leads the district council executive branch and enforces laws passed by members of the district council. The current district council chairman is Joseph Holland Cole of the All People's Congress (APC). He was elected with 53% of the votes in the 2018 Western Area Rural District council election. The Western Area Rural District is traditionally a swing district, with about equal support for both of the two main political parties in Sierra Leone, the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) and the All People's Congress (APC). However, in recent elections from 2007 to the most recent election in 2018, the Western Area Rural District voted by majority for the All People's Congress in presidential, parliamentary and local elections. In the 2018 Sierra Leone Presidential election, Samura Kamara of the APC won 59% of the votes in Western Area Rural District, while Julius Maada Bio of the SLPP received 40% of the votes in the Western Area Rural District. == Largest cities in the Western Area Rural District== *Waterloo, largest city *Newton, second largest city *Benguema *Tombo *Leicester ==Small towns and villages include == *Leicester *Regent *Bureh Town *Jui *Grafton *York *Adonkia *Lakka *Tokeh *Kwama *Samuel Town *Kola Town *Joe Town *Charlotte *Sussexhttp://mindthegaptravel.co.uk/project/beach-conservation/ *Bathurst *Baw Baw *Dublin *Ricketts *Fogbo *Gloucester *Kent *Kerry Town *Kebbie Town *Tissana *Bathkump *Kossoh Town *Cole Town *Rokel *Rokupa *Russell *Stones Town == References == Category:Districts of Sierra Leone Category:Western Area ","title":"Western Area Rural District"},{"id":"7447407","text":"Ann Louise Aiken (born December 29, 1951) is an American attorney and jurist in the state of Oregon. A native Oregonian, she has served as a state court judge of the Oregon circuit courts and worked in private legal practice. She is currently a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. She served as Chief Judge of the Court from February 1, 2009 to January 31, 2016. ==Early years== Aiken was born in Salem, Oregon, on December 29, 1951. In 1974, she graduated from the University of Oregon with a Bachelor of Science degree, and then from Rutgers University in New Jersey in 1976 with a Master of Arts degree. Aiken returned to Oregon and graduated with a Juris Doctor in 1979 from the University of Oregon School of Law. After law school, she worked as a law clerk for Judge Edwin Allen of the Lane County Circuit Court from 1979 to 1980. ==Career== She entered private legal practice in 1980 and remained there until 1982. In 1982, Aiken worked as a fundraiser and field staffer for Ted Kulongoski's unsuccessful campaign for Governor of Oregon in 1982, and then worked as the chief clerk of the Oregon House of Representatives from 1982 to 1983. Aiken returned to private practice that year and remained there until she became a district judge in Lane County in 1988. Based in Eugene, she then became an Oregon circuit court judge in 1992 for Lane County, remaining on the bench until 1997. ==Federal judicial service== President Bill Clinton nominated her to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Oregon vacated by James A. Redden in November 1995, and again on January 7, 1997. Aiken was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 28, 1998, receiving her commission on February 4, 1998. On February 1, 2009, she became Chief Judge of the Court, the first woman to hold that position in the District of Oregon She served in that capacity until January 31, 2016. ===Decisions=== On September 26, 2007, Judge Aiken declared unconstitutional two portions of the USA PATRIOT Act that deal with the government's power to conduct certain surveillance without first obtaining a warrant. The decision received national attention and came in the case of the Brandon Mayfield lawsuit against the federal government for false detainment following the 2004 Madrid train bombings, in which Mayfield was uninvolved in the bombings.Federal judge rules 2 Patriot Act provisions unconstitutional. CNN, accessed September 27, 2007. In the decision, Aiken held that those provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act violate the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Mayfield v. United States. Accessed September 27, 2007. On October 7, 2015, Judge Aiken resentenced Dwight L. Hammond and his son Steven D. Hammond to five years in prison with credit for time served for federal arson, the mandatory minimum for that crime. The Hammonds had illegally set fires on their ranch which burned 140 acres of federal land. U.S. District Judge Michael R. Hogan had sentenced the Hammonds to 3 months and 1 year in prison respectively, but Judge Aiken ruled that the minimum sentences must be followed. Armed militiamen led by Ammon Bundy occupied the Malheur Wildlife Refuge near the Hammonds' ranch in protest of the ruling, demanding that the Hammonds be released and that the hundred-year-old wildlife refuge be given over to local control. The defendants in the case were granted a full Presidential pardon by President Donald J. Trump on July 10, 2018. Judge Aiken made a key decision in the case Juliana v. United States, a suit brought by 21 youths against the U.S. government stating their rights to a clean environment were violated due to actions that the government had taken. While several similar suits at state and federal level had been dismissed, Judge Aiken instead was compelled by the argument that access to a clean environment was a fundamental right, allowing the case to proceed. ==Personal== In 1978, Aiken married James Klonoski, a political science professor at the University of Oregon and one-time chair of the Democratic Party of Oregon. Klonoski died in January 2009.

It was owned by Dumbarton F.C., who played there for 121 years between 1879 and 2000. By the time the ground closed in 2000, it was the oldest stadium in Scotland that had been in continuous use. ==History== Dumbarton first used Boghead Park in 1879. The club shared the first Scottish league championship in 1891 with Rangers, then became the first outright champions in 1892. The pitch was turned 90 degrees in 1913. After this the club constructed a tiny main stand, nicknamed the \\"Postage Box\\", which only had a capacity of 80 seats. It was replaced by a modern facility that held 303 people in 1980. The new stand was opened by Alan Hardaker, former secretary of the English Football League. Next to this stand was a small cover used by bookmakers when Boghead staged greyhound racing. Floodlights were installed in 1957 and the ground's record attendance was set in the same year, 18,001 for a Scottish Cup match against Raith Rovers, which Dumbarton lost 4‚Äì1. Also in 1957 the club bought the platform roof from Turnberry railway station for use as a terrace cover. Having played host to a crowd of almost 20,000, Boghead Park was latterly a sad sight. In 1994, the club was ordered to construct a fence in front of toilets in the ground, because local residents complained that they could see inside the toilets. The ground fell into a level of disrepair and its capacity, which was around 10,000 when Dumbarton played in the Premier Division in the mid-1980s, was reduced to 5,000 by 1995, and less than 3,000 by the time of the ground's closure. This was largely due to the club not maintaining the site as they decided whether to renovate the ground or move on to pastures new. That the board chose to let the ground get into a run down state is signified by the fact that when one of the two stands that existed at Boghead Park in the mid-1980s was destroyed by fire, they chose not to replace it, instead leaving the site empty. Ambitious plans were created for the redevelopment of Boghead Park into an all seated facility with a capacity in the region of 9,000. These plans are on show at the Scottish Football Museum at Hampden Park, but were never put into practice by the club. Dumbarton eventually sold Boghead Park site for a housing development and moved to a new stadium elsewhere in the town, the Dumbarton Football Stadium, in 2000. ==Greyhound racing== A greyhound track was erected around the pitch at Boghead Park in 1932 with the first meeting taking place on 7 October 1932. The track was independent (unlicensed) but the exact date of closure is unknown. ==Groundshares== Boghead Park was used by Greenock Morton for a single match on 1 January 1949; the game against St Mirren was moved from Morton's Cappielow Park as the pitch was unplayable.Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888‚Äì2005, Yore Publications, p155 After leaving New Kilbowie Park, Clydebank used Boghead Park as their home ground between 1996 and 1999, when they moved to Cappielow Park. ==In popular culture== Boghead Park was chosen by Robert Duvall as the supposed home ground of the fictional football team, Kilnockie F.C. for his film, \\"A Shot at Glory\\". Duvall allegedly chose Boghead Park because of its ramshackle nature, but ironically, the filming involved the film crew making improvements to the football ground. The stadium is the subject of the song High Tension At Boghead, released by The Supernaturals as a B-side to their 1997 single Prepare To Land. ==See also== * Scottish stadium moves ==References *Boghead Park Scottish Football Archive Category:Defunct football venues in Scotland Category:Dumbarton F.C.

Nearby localities include Marmarita to the north, al-Huwash to the east, al-Huwash to the east, al-Husn to the southeast, al-Zarah to the south, Naarah and Tell Hawsh to the southwest, al-Mitras to the west and al-Bariqiyah to the northwest. Zweitina is perhaps most famous for its al-Fawwar spring (), which is named so because it flows sporadically; this spring was called Sabte during the reign of the Roman emperor Titus in Syria. The village is also very close to the Krac des Chevaliers, or Qal'at al-·∏§i·π£n. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CNS), Zweitina had a population of 697 in the 2004 census. Its inhabitants are predominantly Greek Orthodox Christians. ==Etymology== The name Zweitina is derived from the word zeitoun which is Arabic for olive. Zweitina is Arabic for a single olive fruit. Olive trees dominate the forests of Zweitina and are considered the most important crops in the village which produces large amounts of olive product, thus justifying the name. Others argue that the name was derived from the Aramaic language and means \\"the land where silkworms grow\\" and refers to the silkworms which live and grow on berry trees found in the village's forests. ==Demographics== Due to changing weather conditions, Zweitina has a changing population, reaching approximately 5,000 inhabitants in summer. It is a village where Christianity dominates. Almost 75% of the original population live outside the village. The US state of Pennsylvania, is home to the largest diaspora of immigrants from the village, approximately 500 families. Zweitina is situated very close to the neighboring village of Marmarita, another Christian village. ==References== Category:Populated places in Talkalakh District Category:Eastern Orthodox Christian communities in Syria ","title":"Zweitina"},{"id":"7447467","text":"Camrail is a company operating passenger and freight traffic between the two largest cities in Cameroon and several smaller cities.

In Classical Athens during the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E., a gymnasiarch was chosen annually from each tribe to bear the expenses of the torch races (see Lampadephoria). The duties included the payment of all expenses connected with the training of the competitors, and the office was one of the most expensive of the public services demanded by Athens of her wealthy citizens. The name seems to imply that the gymnasiarch had also certain rights and duties in the gymnasia during the training of the youths, but there is no definite information on this subject. After the establishment of Macedonian power, there was a change at Athens. One gymnasiarch was chosen annually, and his office was one of great dignity. He had the general oversight of order and discipline in the gymnasium of the epheboi and sometimes financed heavy expenses from his own purse. The same name was given to rich epheboi, who undertook for a longer or shorter period, generally one month, to bear certain heavy charges for their comrades, such as the expenses of festivals, or of furnishing the oil needed in the gymnasium. Outside of Athens and the states which copied her gymnastic system, the term denoted either magistrates who had charge of the gymnastic and literary instruction, or those who have to provide for certain expenses connected with the gymnasium or festivals, either from their own property or from the public funds. There was a wide diversity in details. ==Notable gymnasiarchs== *Claudia Metrodora ==References== * This work in turn cites: ** Glatz, ‚ÄúGymnasiarchia,‚Äù in Daremberg and Saglio, Dictionnaire des antiquit√©s (Paris, 1896) ==Further reading== *Athletics in the Ancient World By E.

He was active in campaigns around the 1967 referendum and the Aboriginal Tent Embassy, dedicating his life to the fight for basic human rights and justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In 1970 Dixon was instrumental in establishing Australia's first Aboriginal Legal Service in Redfern; he co-founded the Tent Embassy in Canberra in 1972. He was the first Aboriginal person to be appointed as a Councillor on the Australia Council and is a former Chairman of the Council's Aboriginal Arts Board. In 1983 Dixon was named the first Aboriginal of the Year. Dixon attended his first political meeting on his 18th birthday in 1946. Inspired by Jack Patten, an organiser of the 1938 Day of Mourning and the Aborigines Progressive Association, he has been politically active ever since. During the 1960s he was spokesperson for the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. In 1972 he travelled to China to highlight the Aboriginal struggle in an attempt to shame the Australian Government into action. Qantas would not fly the group, so Dixon found an airline that would. In 2006 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters for his eminent service to the community by the University of New South Wales.University of New South Wales, Hon Doc for Charles 'Chicka' Dixon, 31 March 2010 During his seventies, he dealt with asbestos poisoning, a legacy from his working days on the Sydney docks as a wharfie.

Jac Glan-y-gors was an accomplished and natural prose writer although his output was small. His best known prose works are Seren Tan Gwmmwl and Toriad y Dydd, political tracts addressed to the Welsh people which reflect the radical ideals of Thomas Paine and the author's Welsh patriotism. His poetical output is more considerable and includes the poem entitled Cerdd Dic Si√¥n Dafydd (Dic Si√¥n Dafydd - Richard son of John son of David - is the name given to a Welshman who despises his language and who imitates the English. Dic Si√¥n Dafydd left Wales and became a draper in London; his pomposity led him to claim that he had forgotten how to speak Welsh, and on a visit to his mother in Wales who spoke only Welsh he insisted on speaking English). The poem lampoons those of the upwardly-mobile Welsh in London who turned their backs on their country and language in order to inveigle themselves to the English. It became one of the most familiar Welsh poems of the 19th century and is still appreciated today. The eponymous 'Dic Si√¥n Dafydd' has entered common usage as a derogatory term for any Welsh person of a similar nature, rather like \\"Uncle Tom\\" in relation to Afro-Americans. In 1789 he moved to London and in 1793 became either the licensee or the manager of the ‚ÄòCanterbury Arms‚Äô in Southwark. He was active in the London-based Gwyneddigion Society, and a founder member in 1794 or 1795 of the Cymreigyddion Society. On the 23rd of July 1816, he married Jane Mondel of Whitehaven in Bermondsey parish church. He died aged 55 on the 21st of May 1821 and was buried in the little church of St Gregory, which is now part of St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral. ==Bibliography== * Seren tan Gwmwl a Toriad y Dydd, (Liverpool, 1923).

He is currently the assistant hitting coach for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Rabelo grew up in the city of New Port Richey, Florida, and attended Ridgewood High School. ==Amateur career== Following his senior year of high school in 1998, Rabelo was drafted in the 13th round of the Major League Baseball amateur draft by the Boston Red Sox. He did not sign, however, instead choosing to play collegiate baseball for the University of Tampa Spartans. In 2000, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Hyannis Mets of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Following his junior season of college, the Detroit Tigers signed Rabelo after selecting him in the 4th round of the 2001 MLB Draft. ==Professional careerDetroit Tigers=== Rabelo began his career with the Single-A Oneonta Tigers of the New York‚ÄìPenn League, where he was named an all star at catcher. He later played for the Single-A West Michigan Whitecaps in 2002 and 2003; the Single-A Lakeland Flying Tigers in 2004; the Double-A Erie SeaWolves in 2004, 2005, and 2006; and the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens to finish out the 2006 season. During his time in the minors, Rabelo developed a reputation as a personal catcher for pitcher Joel Zumaya. Rabelo was added to the Tigers 40-man roster in September 2006, and made his debut the same month. Rabelo began the 2007 season third on the Tigers catching depth chart behind established veterans Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez and backup Vance Wilson. During spring training, Wilson experienced elbow pain, and later learned he would have to undergo Tommy John surgery. As a result, Rabelo began the season on the 25-man active roster, and generally played well, maintaining a batting average that surpassed his minor league average of .263.

The film stars Charles Boyer and Danielle Darrieux with Ren√© Bergeron, Jean Davy, Jean Dax, Jean Debucourt and Gabrielle Dorziat, and Jean-Louis Barrault in a bit part. The film is based on the real-life story of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria, his affair with the 17-year-old Baroness Maria Vetsera and their tragic end at Mayerling. The film was remade twice. Once as the 1957 film Mayerling directed by Anatole Litvak himself and starring Mel Ferrer and Audrey Hepburn. It was also remade as the 1968 film Mayerling in color by MGM, starring Omar Sharif, Catherine Deneuve, James Mason, and Ava Gardner. ==Plot== Vienna is disturbed by protestors agitating for political change. Crown Prince Rudolph is arrested at a meeting. His father Emperor Franz Joseph insists he get married and settle down. Rudolph reluctantly agrees. Five years later, Rudolph has become an unhappy playboy. On the night of his wedding anniversary he meets Baroness Marie Vetsera and they fall in love. ==Cast== *Charles Boyer as Archduke Rudolph of Austria *Jean Dax as Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria *Jean Debucourt as Count Taafe *Marthe Regnier as Baroness Vetsera (Helene) *Danielle Darrieux as Marie Vetsera *Suzy Prim as Countess Larisch *Vladimir Sokoloff as Chief of Police *Andre Dubosc as Loschek the Valet *Ren√© Bergeron as Szeps *Gabrielle Dorziat as Empress Elisabeth *Raymond Aimos *Gina Man√®s as Marinka *Yolande Laffron as Stephanie ==Reception== Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a poor review, describing it as \\"purposeless\\" and \\"a too romantic manner for [his] taste\\". Greene particularly criticizes the conclusion of the film which he characterized as \\"a Vienna 'musical' without the music: a pathetic ending\\". Greene did, however, praise the film's production and acting.

He played for the Chicago Cubs (1935), the Brooklyn Dodgers (1939‚Äì42 and 1946‚Äì48), the Pittsburgh Pirates (1949), and the New York Yankees (1949). ==Professional career== Casey began his professional baseball career with the Atlanta Crackers of the Southern Association, at the age of 18. After going 13‚Äì14 for Memphis in 1938, he was drafted by the Dodgers. He pitched effectively for the next four seasons, but his career is best known for an alleged wild pitch that he threw in the ninth inning of Game 4 in the 1941 World Series, which precipitated a Yankee rally. Catcher Mickey Owen thought that the pitch was a spitball; Casey always swore it wasn't. Officially the play was recorded as a passed ball. Brooklyn lost the game and, eventually, the series. Casey went 0‚Äì2. In January 1943, Casey entered the Navy. He was discharged in December 1945. Upon his return to Brooklyn, he had two good seasons in 1946 and 1947. In 1947, he led the National League in saves for the second time. He pitched well in that year's World Series as well, going 2‚Äì0 with a save, but the Dodgers lost in seven games. Like many of the colorful Dodger players during that era, Casey had his share of adventure. One story recounts a time that he sparred with writer Ernest Hemingway in Hemingway's house. Casey's major league career ended in 1949. He went 10‚Äì4 for his old team, the Crackers, in 1950; Atlanta won the pennant. ==Later life== Towards the end of his life, Casey ran a restaurant in Brooklyn. On July 3, 1951, Casey died in Atlanta, by a self-inflicted shotgun blast to the neck while his estranged wife was pleading with him on the phone. Casey was upset that he had recently been named as the father of child by another woman in a paternity suit. He was 37 years old. Casey was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1991. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball annual saves leaders ==References== * ==External links== *Hugh Casey at The Deadball Era * Category:1913 births Category:1951 deaths Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Baseball players from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Baseball players who committed suicide Category:Sportspeople from Atlanta Category:Military personnel from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Suicides by firearm in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Brooklyn Dodgers players Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:New York Yankees players Category:Atlanta Crackers players Category:Charlotte Hornets (baseball) players Category:Los Angeles Angels (minor league) players Category:Birmingham Barons players Category:Memphis Chickasaws players ","title":"Hugh Casey (baseball)"},{"id":"7447627","text":"Trebor Mai Memorial to Robert Williams (aka Trebor Mai), Llanrwst, c. 1875 Robert Williams (25 May 1830 - 5 August 1877), usually referred to by his bardic name Trebor Mai, was a Welsh language poet, born at Ty'n-yr-ardd near Llanrhychwyn, near Llanrwst, in the old county of Caernarfonshire, the son of a tailor.

Violarite has a characteristic violet colour, hence the name from the Latin 'violaris' alluding to its colour especially when viewed in polished section under a microscope. == Paragenesis == Violarite is formed by oxidisation of primary sulfide assemblages in nickel sulfide mineralisation. The process of formation involves oxidation of Ni2+ and Fe2+ which is contained within the primary pentlandite-pyrrhotite-pyrite assemblage. Violarite is produced at the expense of both pentlandite and pyrrhotite, via the following basic reaction; Pentlandite + Pyrrhotite --> Violarite + Acid :(Fe,Ni)9S8 \\\\+ Fe(1-x)S + O2 ‚Üí Fe2+Ni23+S4 \\\\+ H2SO3 Violarite is also reported to be produced in low-temperature metamorphism of primary sulfides, though this is an unusual paragenetic indicator for the mineral. Continued oxidation of violarite leads to replacement by goethite and formation of a gossanous boxwork, with nickel tending to remain as impurities within the goethite or haematite, or rarely as carbonate minerals. == Occurrence == Violarite is reported widely from the oxidised regolith above primary nickel sulfide ore systems worldwide. It is of particular note from the Mount Keith dunite body, Western Australia, where it forms an important ore mineral. It is also reported from open cast mines around the Kambalda Dome, and Widgiemooltha Dome, in association with polydymite, gaspeite, widgiemoolthalite and hellyerite, among other supergene nickel minerals. === Economic importance === Violarite is an important transitional ore in many nickel sulfide mines, as it has increased nickel tenor (Ni% as a total of sulfide) and occupies a position within the mineralised profile where it must be extracted to pay for development down to the most valuable fresh mineralisation. Violarite mineralisation requires different metallurgy to primary nickel sulfides, due to the different nature of its gangue and its flotation properties. This may require additional treatment and processing, so in some cases low-grade violarite mineralisation is considered refractory ore. == References == * * Grguric, B.A. (2002), Hypogene violarite of exsolution origin from Mount Keith, Western Australia: field evidence for a stable pentlandite-violarite tie line: Mineralogical Magazine: 66: 313-326. * Tenailleau, C., Pring A., Tschmann B., Brugger J., Grguric B., and Putnis A.

The DH.9 was a development of Airco's earlier successful DH.4, with which it shared many components. These were mated to an all-new fuselage and the BHP/Galloway Adriatic engine, which promised increased performance. Anticipating its usefulness, the type was ordered in very large numbers for Britain's Royal Flying Corps (RFC). Upon entering service, the DH.9's performance was found to be unsatisfactory. The Adriatic engine was unreliable and failed to provide the expected power, which gave the DH.9 poorer performance than the aircraft it had been meant to replace. The performance deficit was blamed for the heavy losses they suffered over the Western Front. The redesigned DH.9A was fitted with a more powerful and reliable American Liberty L-12 engine which rectified the shortcomings of the original DH.9 model. ==DevelopmentOrigins=== During June 1917, partially as a result of attacks by German bombers on London, the War Office issued its recommendation to almost double the size of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) to a total of 200 squadrons. In early July 1917, the British Cabinet accepted the recommendation, with the intention that the majority of the new squadrons planned to be equipped with bombers.Bruce 2 April 1956, p. 387. While an order for 700 DH.4s was placed on 28 June 1917, on 23 July 1917, the Air Board were presented with drawings for a modified DH.4 that delivering greater range under a new type number, DH.9. The DH.9 was designed by de Havilland for the Aircraft Manufacturing Company in 1916 as a successor to the DH.4. It used the wings and tail unit of the DH.4 but featured a modified fuselage which moved the pilot closer to the gunner/observer and away from the engine and fuel tank, which facilitated communication and was a more optimal fighting configuration. The other major change from the DH.4 was the choice of the promising new BHP/Galloway Adriatic engine, which was predicted to produce 300 hp (224 kW) to provide adequate performance to match enemy fighters. Based on the performance estimates for the DH.9 (which were initially expected to surpass those of the DH.4), and the similarity to the DH.4, which meant that it would be easy to convert production over to the new aircraft, it was decided to place a massive number of orders (totalling 4,630 aircraft) for the type prior to the aircraft even flying for the first time. Existing contracts originally placed for the DH.4 were also converted to the DH.9. The Air Board had been specifically assured that there would be an initial production delay of no more than a month. According to aviation author J.M Bruce, the selection of the DH.9 \\"seems to have been taken in a spirit of optimism or blind faith, for its chosen engine was, in July 1917, experiencing serious manufacturing difficulties\\".Bruce 1965, pp. 3-4. ===Into flight=== In July 1917, the prototype (a converted DH.4) performed its maiden flight from Hendon Aerodrome, Colindale, London.Jackson 1987, p. 97. Trials of the type were extensive, including a number of tests performed at RAF Martlesham Heath. Unfortunately, the BHP engine proved unable to reliably deliver its expected power; the engine having been de-rated to 230 hp (186 kW) in order to improve its reliability. This deficit had a drastic effect on the aircraft's performance, especially at high altitude, with it being inferior to that of the DH.4 it was supposed to replace. The poor performance of the aircraft meant that the DH.9 would have to fight its way through enemy fighters, which could easily catch the DH.9 where the DH.4 could avoid many of these attacks. As early as November 1917, some officials, such as General Hugh Trenchard, raised repeated objections to the aircraft based upon its disappointing performance; however, in his response, President of the Air Council Sir William Weir started that \\"it was the choice of having the DH.9 with the B.H.P. engine, or of having nothing at all.Bruce 1965, p. 3. Additionally, by this point, production of the DH.9 was already well underway.Bruce 1965, p. 3. Multiple attempts were made to provide the DH.9 with an adequate engine; a number of aircraft were powered by the Siddeley Puma, a lightened and supposedly more powerful version of the BHP. In August 1917, an order for 2,000 Fiat A12 engines was placed, intending to be delivered between January and June 1918 and used upon some production batches of the D.H9; however, deliveries of the Fiat engine were unsatisfactory.Bruce 1965, p. 4. Another alternative powerplant was adopted in the form of the 430 hp (321 kW) Napier Lion engine; one such Lion-engined aircraft achieved a World Altitude Record of 30,500 ft (13,900 m) on 2 January 1919.Jackson 1987, p. 100. However, none of these options were deemed to be entirely satisfactory, it required being redesigned into the DH.9A, for which an American V-12 Liberty engine was adopted, to transform the aircraft. According to Bruce, aside from the engine issue: \\"Certainly, there was little wrong with the aircraft itself\\". ==Design== The Airco DH.9 was a single-engine British bomber aircraft, sharing a high level of similarities with the preceding DH.4. The standard flight surfaces were broadly the same, but adopted a highly redesigned fuselage configuration, including the repositioning of the pilot's cockpit to a more rearwards position. Structurally, the fuselage was similar to its predecessor; plywood cladding covered the forward fuselage, which had no internal bracing, while a conventional wire-braced box girder structure was used aft of the cockpits. Internal stowage for a pair of 230 lb or four 112 lb bombs was provided for, although there was little use of this capability operationally.Bruce 1965, pp. 4-5. While the DH.9 was deemed to be suitable for daytime bombing operations, it was found to be incapable of effective nighttime bombing due to the pilot's view being obstructed and visibility via the bombsight being unsuitable.Bruce 1965, p. 5. The revised cockpit positioning of the DH.9 from the DH.4 placed the pilot and the observer closer together, which was viewed by the RAF as being a considerable advantage in aerial combat; however, the pilot's visibility for ground reconnaissance was decreased as a result. Both radio sets and cameras could be installed. The fuel tanks were enclosed in doped fabric, intended to drain fuel away if the tanks were hit by enemy fire. According to the testing squadron, the DH.9 possessed a high level of manoeuvrability, was relatively easy to perform landings aside from a poor view during the approach. Various improvements and supplementary equipment were trialled and occasionally adopted.Bruce 1965, pp. 7-8. Tests of various engines, radiators, silencers and parachutes were conducted to evaluate their performance, however, few of these improvements were ultimately adopted. During the war, numerous customisations and improvised improvements were made to the aircraft by the maintenance crews of individual squadrons, often for the purpose of addressing the type's engine performance issues.Bruce 1965, pp. 6-8. After the end of the war, many DH.9s, which had been originally delivered as bombers, were sold; these were often reconfigured to serve in different roles, including passenger and cargo transport, trainer aircraft, and as air ambulances.Bruce 1965, pp. 8-10. ==Operational historyFirst World War service=== To boost the rate of production, quantity orders for the DH.9 were also placed with Alliance, G & J.Weir, Short Brothers, Vulcan, Waring & Gillow and National Aircraft Factories No. 1 and No. 2. The first deliveries of the type occurred during November 1917 to 108 Squadron RFC; by the end of 1917, a total of five DH.9s had been delivered and passed their final inspections.Bruce 1965, p. 6. The first combat engagement of the type, performed over France, was performed in March 1918 by No. 6 Squadron RNAS. By July 1918, a total of nine operational squadrons deployed to the Western Front were using the type. The DH.9's performance in action over the Western Front was typically deemed to have been a disaster; heavy losses of the type were quickly incurred, attributed to both its poor performance and to engine failures, despite the prior derating of its engine to reduce the failure rate. Between May and November 1918, a pair of squadrons stationed at the Western Front (Nos. 99 and 104) had 54 of its DH.9s shot down and another 94 aircraft written off due to accidents.Mason 1994, p. 84. On multiple occasions, less than half of a flight of bombers would reach their intended targets; according to Bruce, the successful missions performed by the DH.9 were frequently a product of \\"the courage and determination of the pilots and observers that flew them\\". Squadrons would often implement their own home-built enhancements to their aircraft, such as enlarged carburetor air intakes and modified fuel mixture controls. Nevertheless, the type proved capable during some engagements; on 23 August 1918, a DH.9 flown by Lieutenant Arthur Rowe Spurling of 49 Squadron, with his observer, Sergeant Frank Bell, single-handedly attacked thirty Fokker D.VII fighters, downing five of them.The Aerodrome: Arthur Rowe SpurlingLt. Spurling Won Flying Cross, The Royal Gazette and Colonist Daily (now The Royal Gazette), Hamilton, Bermuda. 19 September 1918.POTSI (archived): Sqn. Ldr. A. Rowe Spurling, DFC On 9 August 1918, Lieutenant E.A. Simpson of 49 Squadron, while flying a bombing mission upon bridges at Falvy and Bethencourt, shot down four hostile fighters while defending against repeated attacks upon the formation.Bruce 1965, p. 7. In another instance, Captain John Stevenson Stubbs achieved 11 aerial victories in a DH.9, including the highly unusual feat of balloon busting while flying the type.\\"John Stevenson Stubbs\\" theaerodrome.com, Retrieved: 1 May 2011. Despite its general lack of performance, due to its large numbers, the DH.9 was introduced to nearly every theatre of the conflict prior to the signing of the Armistice of 11 November 1918, which ended the conflict. Reportedly, the DH.9 was also more successful in combat against the Turkish forces in the Middle East, where they faced less aerial opposition. Stationed at coastal aerodromes across the British mainland, the type was also used extensively to perform coastal patrol missions with the aim of deterring the operations of enemy U-boats. ===Post war service=== Following the end of the First World War, a number of DH.9s operated by 47 Squadron and 221 Squadron were sent to southern Russia in 1919 in support of the White Russian Army of General Denikin, participating in the Russian Civil War. In this theatre, the aircraft were often operating within challenging conditions.Bruce 1965, p. 8. The last combat use of the DH.9 by the RAF was in support of the final campaign against Mohammed Abdullah Hassan (known by the British as the \\"Mad Mullah\\") in Somalia during January‚ÄìFebruary 1920.Bruce 13 April 1956, p. 424. Amongst those aircraft used in Somalia, one DH.9 was modified to function as an air ambulance, being able to load and transport a single stretcher case, which was carried upon the upper longerons directly to the rear of the pilot's cockpit.Bruce 1965, pp. 8-9. Further ambulance conversions were performed, including a number that were operated by the Royal Netherlands Air Force. Surprisingly, production was allowed to continue after the end of the war into 1919. In 1920, the DH.9 was finally withdrawn from service by the RAF. In addition to British manufacturing, several other countries had commenced production of the type; perhaps the most significant of these was the Airco DH.9A, which was fitted with the American V-12 Liberty engine, and was produced in the thousands even though production was curtailed by the signing of the Armistice that had ended the First World War. Belgium and Spain also produced the type, the latter producing hundreds of the type equipped with a 300 hp Hispano-Suiza engine; some of these were still in service in 1940. Following the end of the conflict, large numbers of surplus DH.9s became available at low prices and the type was widely exported; this included those aircraft that were donated to Commonwealth nations as part of the Imperial Gift programme.Bruce 1965, p. 9. The South African Air Force (SAAF) received a total of 48 DH.9s, and used them extensively, including against the Rand Revolt in 1922. Several South African aircraft were later re-engined with Bristol Jupiter radial engines as the M‚Ä≤pala; such modified aircraft continued to serve until 1937.Jackson 1987, p. 102. ===Civilian service=== DH-9 G-AUED modified with a cabin for use as an airliner After the end of the war, large numbers of surplus DH.9s became available, having been deemed to be surplus to requirements by their original military operators; accordingly, many were resold onto civil operators, such as by early aerial transport companies. Large numbers were modified to better perform as transport aircraft, such as the cabin being suitably adapted for the carriage of passengers. In this role, the DH.9 provided a useful load carrying capability and was relatively inexpensive to procure. Accordingly, in various configurations, the type saw prolific use by civil operators. Early air services between London, Paris and Amsterdam were operated by a fleet of DH.9s owned by Aircraft Transport and Travel. A number of DH9s were converted into floatplanes and saw use in India, Bolivia and Rhodesia.Bruce 1965, pp. 9-10. Several aircraft were reconfigured to serve as trainer aircraft, being refitted with Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar engines and rubber undercarriages; designated as DH.9Js, the last of these were withdrawn and scrapped in 1936.Bruce 1965, p. 10. A number of different DH.9 conversion programmes for civil use were carried out, both by Airco and its successor, the de Havilland Aircraft Company, and by other third party companies, such as the Aircraft Disposal Company.Jackson 1973, pp. 50-52. Some radial powered DH.9Js continued in civil use until 1936.Jackson 1973, p. 56. ==Variants== *DH.9 ‚Äì Revised version of the DH.4 with the pilot and observer/gunner placed closer together (3,024 production aircraft built with others built in Belgium and Spain). *DH.9A ‚Äì (also referred to as the Nine- Ack) was designed for Airco by Westland Aircraft to take advantage of the 400 hp (298 kW) American Liberty L-12 engine. Apart from the new engine and slightly larger wings it was identical to the DH.9. Initially it was hoped to quickly replace the DH.9 with the new version, but the shortage of Liberty engines available to the RAF limited the new type's service in the First World War, and it is best known as a standard type in the postwar RAF, serving as a general purpose aircraft for several years. 2,300 DH.9As were built by ten different British companies. *DH.9B ‚Äì Conversions for civilian use as three- seaters (one pilot and two passengers) *DH.9C ‚Äì Conversions for civilian use as four-seaters (one pilot and three passengers) *DH.9J ‚Äì Modernised and re- engined conversions using the 385 hp (287 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar III radial engine.

They are often liberal arts colleges. There were approximately 34 active women's colleges in the United States in 2018, down from a peak of 281 such colleges in the 1960s. ==HistoryOrigins and types=== :See also: Timeline of historically black women's colleges Mount Holyoke College (Mount Holyoke Female Seminary) in 1837 Wesleyan College Education for girls and women was originally provided within the family, by locals dame schools and public elementary schools, and at female seminaries found in every colony, but limited to young ladies from families with the means to pay tuition and, arguably, still more limited by the focus on providing ladylike accomplishments rather than academic training. These seminaries or academies were usually small and often ephemeral, usually established founded by a single woman or small group of women, they often failed to outlive their founders. In evaluating the many claims of various colleges to have been the \\"first\\" women's college, it is necessary to understand that a number of these 18th- or early 19th-century female seminaries later grew into academic, degree-granting colleges, while others became notable private high schools. However, to have been a female seminary at an early date is not the same thing as to have been a women's college at that date. Wesleyan College, chartered in 1836 as a full college for women that could grant degrees equivalent to those men were receiving at the time, was the first true \\"women's college\\" in the United States. Institutions of higher education for women, however, were primarily founded during the early 19th century, many as teaching seminaries. As noted by the Women's College Coalition: > The formal education of girls and women began in the middle of the 19th > century and was intimately tied to the conception that society had of the > appropriate role for women to assume in life. Republican education prepared > girls for their future role as wives and mothers and taught religion, > singing, dancing, literature, etcetera. Academic education prepared girls > for their role as community leaders and social benefactors and had some > elements of the education offered boys. Seminaries educated women for the > only socially acceptable occupation: teaching. Only unmarried women could be > teachers. Many early women's colleges began as female seminaries and were > responsible for producing an important corps of educators.The Rise of > Women's Colleges, Coeducation Irene Harwarth, Mindi Maline, and Elizabeth DeBra further note that, \\"women's colleges were founded during the mid- and late-19th century in response to a need for advanced education for women at a time when they were not admitted to most institutions of higher education.\\" Early proponents of education for women were Sarah Pierce (Litchfield Female Academy, 1792); Catharine Beecher (Hartford Female Seminary, 1823); Zilpah P. Grant Banister (Ipswich Female Seminary, 1828); and Mary Lyon. Lyon was involved in the development of both Hartford Female Seminary and Ipswich Female Seminary. She was also involved in the creation of Wheaton Female Seminary (now Wheaton College, Massachusetts) in 1834; it was re-chartered as a college in 1912. In 1837, Lyon founded Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (Mount Holyoke College), it was chartered as a college in 1888. Harwarth, Maline, and DeBra note that, \\"Mount Holyoke's significance is that it became a model for a multitude of other women's colleges throughout the country.\\". Both Vassar College and Wellesley College were patterned after Mount Holyoke. Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia was the first college chartered for women, receiving its charter in 1836. Vassar College was the first of the Seven Sisters to be chartered as a college in 1861. In 1840, the first Catholic women's college Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College was founded by Saint Mother Theodore Guerin of the Sisters of Providence in Indiana as an academy, later becoming the college. The college became co-educational in 2015. Vassar College in 1862 Some early women's colleges, such as Oread Institute chartered as a college for women in Worcester, Massachusetts 1849, and the Baltimore Female College, also founded 1849 at St. Paul Street and East Saratoga Street in downtown Baltimore, later relocating to Park Avenue/Park Place and Wilson Street in the Bolton Hill neighborhood under its longtime president Dr. Nathan C. Brooks, (1809-1898), a noted classics scholar (until closing in the late 1880s), however failed to survive. Agnes Scott College Another early women's school was the Moravian College, founded as a female seminary in 1742 in Germantown and later moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania it was originally called the Bethlehem Female Seminary. It began to grant undergraduate degrees in 1863 and became the Moravian Seminary and College for Women in 1913. In 1954, it combined with the boys school, Moravian College and Theological Seminary and became coeducational. The Moravians of Salem, North Carolina began what is now Salem College in 1772 in Winston- Salem. While there were a few coeducational colleges (such as Oberlin College founded in 1833, Guilford College, in 1837, Lawrence University in 1847, Antioch College in 1853, and Bates College in 1855), almost all colleges and universities at that time were exclusively for men. The first generally accepted coordinate college, H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College, (with Tulane University), was founded in 1886, and followed a year later by Evelyn College for Women, the coordinate college for Princeton University. The model was quickly duplicated at other prestigious universities. Notable 19th-century coordinate colleges included Barnard (with Columbia University), Pembroke (with Brown University), and Radcliffe College (with Harvard University). Twentieth-century examples include William Smith College (coordinate with Hobart College) and Kirkland College associated with Hamilton College. (The latter no longer exists as a stand-alone institution.) While the majority of women's colleges are private institutions, there were a few public colleges. In 1884 the legislature of the state of Mississippi established Industrial Institute & College, (later Mississippi University for Women) the first public college for women in the United States. Other states soon followed: Georgia created Georgia State College for Women in 1889, North Carolina created North Carolina Women's College in 1891, and Florida converted its coeducational Florida State College to a women-only school in 1905. This is similar to the establishment of Douglass Residential College (Rutgers University), which was founded as the New Jersey College for Women in 1918 by Mabel Smith Douglass. Additional types of women's colleges include the Seven Sister colleges in the Northern United States, historically black female educational institutions, small Catholic women's colleges in the United States (SCWCs), and women's colleges in the Southern United States. ===20th-century=== World War II Early in 1942, during World War II, debate arose concerning the role of colleges and students during the War. The Selective Service age had been lowered to 18 and a few questions arose: which men would go to college, which ones into the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, or the U.S. Coast Guard, how the college students would be trained, and whether the colleges would be run by the military organizations or by educators? The status of women and women's colleges also entered into the debate: \\"Urging a National Service Act for women, the American Council on Education's President George Zook said: 'It is clear that women students cannot expect to pursue college as usual while their brothers and male friends are rushed off ... Courses for women are going to be shortened and they are going to be directed toward preparation for specific types of war service. ... These War jobs are going to appear to college women to be hard and distasteful. Stronger words could be used for what many of the men are going through'.\\" Women's College Coalition The Women's College Coalition (WCC) was founded in 1979 and describes itself as an \\"association of women's colleges and universities ‚Äì public and private, independent and church-related, two- and four-year ‚Äì in the United States and Canada whose primary mission is the education and advancement of women.\\" Coeducation Smith College With several Supreme Court cases in the 1950s on the appellate court level determining that public single-sex universities violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution, many women's colleges have decided to accept males. Following a peak of 281 women's colleges in the 1960s, the number of such schools has decreased dramatically. Two of the Seven Sister colleges made transitions during and after the 1960s. The first, Radcliffe College, merged with Harvard University. Beginning in 1963, students at Radcliffe received Harvard diplomas signed by the presidents of Radcliffe and Harvard and joint commencement exercises began in 1970. The same year, several Harvard and Radcliffe dormitories began swapping students experimentally and in 1972 full co-residence was instituted. The departments of athletics of both schools merged shortly thereafter. In 1977, Harvard and Radcliffe signed an agreement that put undergraduate women entirely in Harvard College. In 1999 Radcliffe College was dissolved and Harvard University assumed full responsibility over the affairs of female undergraduates. Radcliffe is now the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Women's Studies at Harvard University. The second, Vassar College, declined an offer to merge with Yale University and instead became coeducational in 1969. The remaining Seven Sisters decided against coeducation. Mount Holyoke College engaged in a lengthy debate under the presidency of David Truman over the issue of coeducation. On November 6, 1971, \\"after reviewing an exhaustive study on coeducation, the board of trustees decided unanimously that Mount Holyoke should remain a women's college, and a group of faculty was charged with recommending curricular changes that would support the decision.\\" Smith College also made a similar decision in 1971. In 1969, Bryn Mawr College and Haverford College (then all-male) developed a system of sharing residential colleges. When Haverford became coeducational in 1980, Bryn Mawr discussed the possibly of coeducation as well, but decided against it. In 1983, Columbia University began admitting women after a decade of failed negotiations with Barnard College for a merger along the lines of Harvard and Radcliffe (Barnard has been affiliated with Columbia since 1900, but it continues to be independently governed). Wellesley College also decided against coeducation during this time. A few historically black women's colleges became coeducational: Barber-Scotia College adopted coeducation in 1954; Tillotson College (a women's college from 1926 to 1935) is now coeducational Huston- Tillotson University; Hartshorn Memorial College merged with Virginia Union University in 1932; and Mary Allen Seminary became coeducational in 1933. Bennett College, founded as a coeducational school, became a women's college in 1926. Many public women's schools also went coeducational in the postwar era. One of the first schools to make the transition in this era was Madison College in Virginia, known since 1976 as James Madison University. The school, founded as a women's college in 1908, admitted its first male day students in 1946, although it was not officially recognized as a coeducational institution until 1966. In 1947, Florida State College for Women returned to its original status as a coeducational institution and adopted its current name of Florida State University. Three other public women's schools in Virginia later followed Madison College in adopting coeducation‚ÄîMary Washington College, now the University of Mary Washington, in 1970; Radford College, now Radford University, in 1972; and Longwood College, now Longwood University, in 1976. In North Carolina, the Women's College of the University of North Carolina was converted to the coeducational University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 1963, at the same time as women were finally admitted to all programs of its rival school, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In 1967, the school then known as the Women's College of Georgia became coeducational; it is now Georgia College & State University. Mills College Mississippi University for Women changed its single-sex admissions policy to include men in 1982 following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan. The court found that the university would violate the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause if it denied admission to its nursing program on the basis of gender. The 5-4 opinion was written by Justice O'Connor, who stated that \\"In limited circumstances, a gender-based classification favoring one sex can be justified if it intentionally and directly assists members of the sex that is disproportionately burdened.\\" She argued that there are a disproportionate number of women who are nurses, and that denying admission to men \\"lends credibility to the old view that women, not men, should become nurses, and makes the assumption that nursing is a field for women a self-fulfilling prophecy.\\"\\"Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan\\", 458 U.S. 718 (1982) The ruling did not require the university to change its name to reflect its coeducational status. In 1972, Texas Woman's University allowed men to its health science graduate school. In 1994, the university opened all programs to male students. Despite the university accepting male students, the university's mission is still to serve primarily women. Today, the student body is approximately 90% female and is led by a woman chancellor. On May 3, 1990, the Trustees of Mills College announced that they had voted to admit male students. This decision led to a two-week student and staff strike, accompanied by numerous displays of non-violent protests by the students. At one point, nearly 300 students blockaded the administrative offices and boycotted classes. On May 18, the Trustees met again to reconsider the decision, leading finally to a reversal of the vote. ===21st-century=== The trend toward coeducation continued in the 21st century. Notre Dame College in Ohio admitted its first men in 2001. In Pennsylvania, Seton Hill University went coeducational in 2002, and Chestnut Hill College, which had established a coeducational graduate program in 1980, admitted its first male undergraduates in 2003. Beginning in late 2004 the debate concerning coeducation resurfaced when, citing decreased enrollment, Wells College announced that it would adopt coeducation. In response, there were student protests on campus. Parents of students also became involved in the protests, as did many alumnae. Some of the students stated that their protests were patterned after those at Mills College in the early 1990s. A website called Wells for Women was also established. When the decision to adopt coeducation was approved, students filed a lawsuit that was eventually rejected. Wells became coeducational in 2005. A few other colleges became coeducational in this period. Immaculata University and Lesley College also announced that they would adopt coeducation around this time and became coeducational in 2005. In 2006, H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College was dissolved as part of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. In 2007, Douglass College of Rutgers University merged with the coed Rutgers College, changing its name to the Douglass Residential College. While a part of Rutgers, it will offer dormitories and classes exclusively for women. Regis College became coeducational in 2007. Debate increased when Randolph-Macon Woman's College announced that it would adopt coeducation and change its name. Former Interim president Ginger H. Worden argued (in a September 17, 2006 editorial for the Washington Post) that it was not economically feasible for the college to remain single-sex as young women are no longer interested in attending women's colleges. In response, a number of presidents of women's colleges challenged Worden's article, arguing that other women's colleges are still doing well and attracting students. This includes: Agnes Scott College, Converse College, Columbia College, The Seven Sisters, a separate article from Mount Holyoke College,Mount Holyoke College :A Tradition of Their Own Simmons College, and Hollins University. Sweet Briar College announced March 3, 2015, that it was closing Aug. 25 due to \\"insurmountable financial challenges.\\" Almost immediately, a legal challenge was mounted by students, faculty, and alumnae to keep the school open. On June 22, 2015, a settlement brokered by the attorney general of Virginia was accepted by the county circuit court that resulted in Sweet Briar College remaining open. In addition, there were numerous protests on campus including rallies, blocking administrative offices, mass requests for transfer transcripts, banners all over campus, striking from classes, and participation in quiet protest to highlight lack of student voices in the board of trustees votes. This led to the formation of a non-profit organization Preserve Education Choice (PEC), composed of students, faculty, and alumnae who are trying to reverse the decision. Preserve Education Choice filed two lawsuits. The Lynchburg Circuit Court dismissed both lawsuits on January 23, 2007. PEC raised enough money, however, to appeal both dismissals and a group of nine students brought the case to the Virginia Supreme Court where Richmond lawyer Wyatt B. Durrette Jr. asked the court to grant an appeal of the group's lawsuit.Va. Supreme Court hears argument for appeal of coed challenge In addition, Professor emeritus of romance languages, Charlotte Stern, published the 24 page letter, with signatures from alumnae, former professors and a former president of Randolph's board of trustees, condemning the decision on the PEC website. Ginger Hill Worden, Interim President, responded to this letter. The Virginia Supreme Court agreed to hear appeals in both the student contract and charitable trust cases. The Court affirmed the trial court's decision in both cases in opinions issued June 6, 2008. It was renamed Randolph College on July 1, 2007, when it became coeducational. A similar controversy erupted in 2011 when Peace College, in Raleigh, North Carolina, announced its plans to become coeducational beginning the following year. Despite protests from alumnae, William Peace University began admitting men in the fall of 2012. Also in fall 2012, Georgian Court University in New Jersey admitted its first male day students; in 2013‚Äì14, that school became fully coeducational, with men being allowed to live on campus and participate in all campus activities. The trend of former women's colleges becoming coed continued in the last half of the 2010s. Midway University in Kentucky announced in May 2016 that it would admit men into its daytime undergraduate program, the last component of the institution that remained women-only, effective that August. In announcing the move, the school's president noted that many surveys indicated that only 2% of high school girls wanted to attend a women-only school, and added, \\"We see this change as strengthening our historic mission to educate women by broadening our reach to that 98 percent of young women who would never consider a women's college.\\" The following year, the University of Saint Joseph in Connecticut, the last women-only school in the state and last Catholic women's college in New England, voted to become fully coeducational, with the first men admitted to the daytime undergraduate program in August 2018. Much like Midway, the daytime undergraduate program had been the last Saint Joseph component to be women-only; the institution already had male graduate students, plus male undergraduates in a special evening program for adult students. When this transition was announced, Saint Joseph's president cited the same surveys as Midway's president had in 2016. A number of women's colleges have taken steps to adopt policies inclusive of transgender students. As of June 2015, seven women's colleges (Barnard College, Bryn Mawr College, Mills College, Mount Holyoke College, Simmons College, Scripps College, and Smith College) have articulated admissions policies regarding transgender applicants. ==Top 10 ranking== The popular college ranking website Niche have the following women's colleges as the top 10 in America: Barnard College, Wellesley College, Smith College, Bryn Mawr College, Mount Holyoke College, Scripps College, Spelman College, Agnes Scott College, College of Saint Benedict, and Simmons University.https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-womens-colleges/ ==Notable alumnae of women's colleges== Women's colleges in the United States have produced a number of important alumnae in the arts, business, politics, and in the sciences. ==List of women's colleges and universities in the United States== *Agnes Scott College *Alverno College *Barnard College *Bay Path University *Bennett College for Women *Brenau University *Bryn Mawr College *Cedar Crest College *College of Saint Mary *Columbia College *Converse College *Cottey College *Hollins University *Judson College *Meredith College *Mills College *Moore College of Art and Design *Mount Holyoke College *Mount Mary University *Notre Dame of Maryland University *Russell Sage College of The Sage Colleges *St. Catherine University *Saint Mary's College *Salem College *Scripps College *Simmons University *Smith College *Spelman College *Stephens College *Sweet Briar College *Trinity Washington University *Ursuline College *Wellesley College *Wesleyan College *The Women's College of the University of Denver ==See also== *List of current and historical women's universities and colleges in the United States *Women Presidents or Chancellors of Co-ed Colleges and Universities *Timeline of women's colleges in the United States *Seven Sisters (colleges) *Women's colleges in the Southern United States *Women's College Coalition *List of girls' schools in the United States *Men's colleges in the United States *Mixed-sex education ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Creighton, Joanne V.

Patten was educated at public schools in Tumbarumba and West Wyalong, and attended high school at West Wyalong. Following high school, Patten was unsuccessful in joining the Navy and worked for the Sydney Municipal Council. To make ends meet he occasionally worked as a boxer. While boxing at Casino in 1931, Patten married Selina Avery. During the 1930s he became an experienced organiser and public speaker, speaking regularly on Aboriginal rights at the Domain on Sunday afternoons, along with other Aboriginal activists such as Pearl Gibbs and Tom Foster. In 1937, Patten co-founded the Aborigines Progressive Association with William Ferguson. As President of the APA Patten organised the 1938 Day of Mourning protest, and led an APA delegation to meet with Joseph Lyons, the Prime Minister. The delegation presented Lyons with Patten and Ferguson's manifesto Aborigines Claim Citizenship Rights, which included Patten's 10-point plan for citizenship rights for Aboriginal people. In April 1938, Patten established a short-lived monthly newspaper, The Abo Call, the first such Aboriginal-focused publication of its kind. Due to the Depression however, it folded in September 1938 after six issues due to a shortage of funds. On 4 February 1939 Patten visited Cummeragunja at the request of his father, John Patten Snr, who was a resident on the station. Patten addressed a large gathering of the station's residents in relation to the deteriorating conditions and the intimidation to which the residents were being subjected to under the government appointed manager, Arthur McQuiggan. Patten raised the subject of New South Wales government plans for the removal of Aboriginal children and gave clarity to the station's residents regarding their rights. Patten convinced a majority of the station's residents to leave Cummeragunja, in an event which would come to be known as the Cummeragunja walk-off. Patten was then arrested for \\"inciting Aborigines\\". Throughout 1939 Patten led a campaign for Aboriginal people to be able to serve in the Australian armed forces. Previously, Aboriginal people had served in every major Australian conflict, but were required to provide proof that they were of substantial non-Aboriginal ancestry. Following a successful campaign, Patten enlisted in the Australian Army, serving with the 2nd AIF in the Middle East. He was discharged in 1942, returning home with a knee badly damaged by shrapnel. ===Death=== Patten died in hospital in October 1957 after being involved in a motor vehicle accident in Fitzroy in Melbourne. ==References *Jack Patten - Australian Aboriginal Civil Rights Leader, KooriHistory.com *Patten, John Thomas (Jack) (1905 - 1957), Australian Dictionary of Biography *Collaborating for Indigenous Rights: Jack Patten, National Museum of Australia Category:1905 births Category:1957 deaths Category:Australian indigenous rights activists Category:Australian political journalists Category:Road incident deaths in Victoria (Australia) Category:Australian Army personnel of World War II ","title":"Jack Patten"},{"id":"7447819","text":"Andrew Hurrell, FBA is Montague Burton Professor of International Relations and a Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford.

Torsello, a Muslim convert, was released on 3 November 2006. He is author of The Heart of Kashmir. ==Kidnapping== Torsello was abducted in Helmand on 12 October 2006 and released on 3 November 2006. He was travelling on a bus from Helmand to Kandahar in southern Afghanistan when he was seized. His translator Ghulam Mohammad was left unharmed. His captors moved him into a different location: \\"They arrived and opened the door.

I had the chains - I couldn't follow him and I had to jump to be able to follow him. I thought they were going to kill me. But they put me in a car instead.\\" He was kept in chains in a windowless room during his captivity, living on a diet of potatoes and Afghan bread dipped in a watery soup. According to the BBC and consolidated international press reports on a National Union of Journalists Photographers‚Äô blog, Torsello made a telephone call on 12 October 2006 to the director of the hospital in Lashkar Gah confirming that he had been kidnapped and did not know where he was being held.‚ÄòReporter abducted in Afghanistan‚Äô, bbc.co.uk, 15 Oct 06 He asked the director to explain to the kidnappers that he was a genuine photo reporter and not a spy. The phone call was eventually cut off, but he was able on a few occasions later to contact the Italian organisation Emergency who ran the hospital. A press release from Reporters Without Borders quoted Mullah Dadullah, a Taleban military chieftain, who threatened on 4 September 2006 to kill journalists who published news put out by the NATO forces in Afghanistan, as saying \\"We have an Islamic right to kill such reporters.\\"‚ÄòGabriele Torsello makes contact to report he is well but reasons for kidnapping still unclear‚Äô, Reporters Without Borders/Reporters Sans Frontiers, 17 Oct 06 However, a later report quotes a Taleban spokesman, Qari Yousaf Ahmadi, telling the Afghan news agency Pajhwok that the kidnappers should \\"free their hostage because it is not fair to hit at Italy by killing an innocent journalist.\\" He added that \\"the kidnappers are just bandits interested in money.\\" Reporters Without Borders suggest that their original demands might have been just a way of introducing a ransom request.‚ÄòKidnappers say Italian photographer still in good health‚Äô, Reporters Without Borders/Reporters Sans Frontiers, 25 Oct 06 It is possible that the Taleban issue statements such as this to make kidnappings appear to be political rather than an exercise in revenue generation. To confuse the position, the captors are reported to have contacted Emergency and asked, in exchange for freeing Torsello, for the return to Afghanistan of Abdul Rahman, the Afghan citizen who converted to Christianity and who escaped to Italy after he was sentenced to death in March 2006. Furthermore, the Italian press agency AGI on 20 October 2006, quoted Torsello as saying, under duress, \\"The kidnappers frequently tell me that I am a spy and that British troops bombed Musa Qala and Nawzad districts on my intelligence\\", but that the abductors, contrary to their previous remarks, distanced themselves from the Taleban and said they were just Muslims fighting foreign occupation in the war-battered country. Contact with Torsello was sporadic, but on 3 November, his kidnappers made a final telephone call to Emergency (who had been acting as intermediaries during the negotiations), advising that Torsello had been released near Kandahar.

It is the fourth track on side two of their 1977 album Exodus and was released as a single in 1980. The song reached the Top 20 in the UK, peaking at number 17. It is one of Marley's most popular songs and has been covered by numerous other artists. The song is often thought to be named \\"Don't Worry About a Thing\\" or \\"Every Little Thing is Gonna Be All Right\\", because of the prominent and repeated use of these phrases in the chorus. ==Writing and inspiration== The source of Marley's inspiration for the lyrics of \\"Three Little Birds\\" remains disputed. They are partly inspired by birds that Marley was fond of that used to fly and sit next to his home.Goldman (2006), p. 241 Tony Gilbert, a long time friend of Marley, was present at the time he was writing the song and elaborated, \\"Bob got inspired by a lot of things around him, he observed life. I remember the three little birds. They were pretty birds, canaries(sic), who would come by the windowsill at Hope Road.\\" However, three female singers from the reggae group I Threes who did shows with Marley claim it is a reference to them. I Threes member Marcia Griffiths remarked, \\"After the song was written, Bob would always refer to us as the Three Little Birds. After a show, there would be an encore, sometimes people even wanted us to go back onstage four times. Bob would still want to go back and he would say, 'What is my Three Little Birds saying?'\\" ==CoversReleases=== *Karen David recorded and released the song on her 2012 EP, Touch. *Robbie Williams sings the song in his concert released on DVD. *Gilberto Gil recorded and released the song as a single and for his 2002 album Kaya N'Gan Daya. *Billy Ocean does a version on his 2005 greatest hits album The Best Of.... *Ziggy Marley and Sean Paul recorded a cover for the 2004 animated film Shark Tale and its soundtrack.

During his tenure with the Boston Red Sox, the crowd at Fenway Park would sing along whenever Victorino came to bat. The song became associated with the 2013 Red Sox team, who won that year's World Series. At the Johan Cruijff ArenA, the song is played during Ajax games near the end of half-time. It has become arguably the team's anthem. The song was used in the \\"Full of Life\\" ad for Danone Actimel Ireland. In 2012, Marley's oldest child, Cedella Marley, adapted lyrics from the song in a picture book titled Every Little Thing, featuring illustrations by Vanessa Brantley-Newton. In 2013, Marley's son, Stephen Marley, with Jason Bentley, remixed the song for an ad campaign by the automobile manufacturer Hyundai in the United States for their Bluelink in-vehicle telematics system. In 2015, Plymouth Argyle fans sang the song's chorus in a playoff match against Wycombe Wanderers. Plymouth Argyle were losing 3-0 with 10 minutes to go, but after the fans began singing, Zak Ansah and Jason Banton both scored goals and kept the Pilgrims playoff hopes alive. In 2016, the travelling fans of Liverpool F.C. adopted it as they followed their team across Europe. Since then it can now also be heard regularly at their home games. The Milwaukee Brewers baseball team plays the song as fans leave Miller Park after home losses. In 2020, Marley's grandson Skip Marley is joined by students of the School of Rock to cover the song during the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Monty Alexander version== Monty Alexander recorded a cover of \\"Three Little Birds\\" in January 1992 and, in 1999, he released it as a hit single. The cover was also produced by him and, unlike the original, the Monty Alexander version is very Jazz-heavy. ===Track listings=Connie Talbot version== \\"Three Little Birds\\" was released as the first single by British child singer Connie Talbot on 10 June 2008. It was taken from the 2008 re-release of her 2007 album, Over the Rainbow. Talbot released a music video to publicise the single, which was filmed in Jamaica. The release reached number 3 on the UK Independent Singles Chart, and number 1 on the Billboard Hot Singles Sales chart in the United States. ===Background=== After rising to fame on the first series of Britain's Got Talent, Talbot signed with Rainbow Recording Company and began production of her debut album, Over the Rainbow. The album initially featured several Christmas themed songs, and the first single, \\"Over the Rainbow\\"/\\"White Christmas\\", was planned be released on 3 December 2007. The single was then cancelled in favour of an album-first release. The album was rereleased with more general tracks to replace the Christmas songs, and one of the new tracks was a cover of Bob Marley's \\"Three Little Birds\\". The songs on the album were chosen with collaboration between Talbot and her management; first Talbot and her family wrote \\"a list of the songs that Connie would sing at her birthday party\\", and the management then thought \\"long and hard\\" about including the more adult songs, including \\"I Will Always Love You\\", but Talbot herself insisted. The album was recorded in a bedroom studio, nicknamed \\"the hut\\". ===Release and reception=== \\"Three Little Birds\\" was released as Talbot's first single on 10 June 2008 in the UK, and released alongside the album in the U.S. on 14 October. Rashvin Bedi, writing for Malaysian newspaper The Star, said that \\"Three Little Birds\\" was her favourite song on Over the Rainbow. The single peaked at number 3 on the Independent Singles Charts in the United Kingdom, and entered the Billboard Hot Singles Sales chart at number 2, dropping to 3 the next week. It then rose back to number 2, and, on the sixth week, reached number 1. Talbot received attention from the British press because of the single's success, with the Daily Telegraph attributing her success in America to her appeal to the Christian market. As of November 2008, the single has sold more than 250,000 copies worldwide. ===Music video=== The music video for the single was released on June 19, 2008. It was shot in Jamaica in late March/early April 2008. The video begins with images of Talbot skipping through a garden, which is then replaced with an image of her singing on a beach. She then joins a child whose parents had been arguing and plays with them and others in a field, then dances with them on the beach. The children are then led to a stage, where Talbot performs as the others sing and play musical instruments. The video closes with Talbot in the garden, skipping away from the camera. ===Chart performance=== {  ! Chart ! Country ! Peak !

It is now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. ==History== The work was in the Escorial monastery, although it was not mentioned in inventories; later it was moved to the Prado. It is likely that the work was one of the Temptations sent to the monastery by Philip II of Spain in 1574. This painting has a more serene atmosphere than the triptych with the same theme now in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga of Lisbon. Like all Bosch's works, it cannot be dated with precision, although it is likely from his late production (1500‚Äì1516). In 2016, the Bosch Research and Conservation project, after five years of researching all known Bosch paintings, announced that they had significant doubts about the attribution of the work to Bosch, instead attributing it to a follower. ==Description== Detail St. Anthony the Abbot is portrayed in meditation, in a sunny landscape near the trunk of a dry tree. St. Anthony is a recurrent figure in Bosch's work, with up to 15 paintings of this subject, all inspired by legends told in the Golden Legend and in his Life by Athanasius of Alexandria. He is represented in a setting of solitude and temptation that the saint experienced over twenty years. Although this picture is significantly different from other works by Bosch of St. Anthony, such as the triptych painting of the same name, customary features of the abbot include his dark brown habit with the Greek letter \\"tau\\" and a pig by his side. In contrast to the earlier paintings with St. Anthony, this version of the temptation of St. Anthony finds the abbot calmer from his meditative spirit. His surroundings are peaceful and evoke a sense of calm. The pig lies next to him like a pet. Once demons, the creatures of temptation are now more like goblins and do not disturb the peaceful feeling of the painting. This painting, originally framed with a semi-circular arch, was one of Bosch's later works, from sometime after 1490. Philip II of Spain sent it to the Monastery of El Escorial near Madrid. From there the painting came to the Museo del Prado as part of the Royal Collection. ==See also== *Triptych of the Temptation of St. Anthony *List of paintings by Hieronymus Bosch ==ReferencesSources== * ==External links== *Page at official website *Complete Works by Hieronymus Bosch Category:Paintings by Hieronymus Bosch in the Museo del Prado Category:16th-century paintings Category:Religious paintings Category:Animals in art Category:Paintings of Anthony the Great Category:Pigs in art la:Temptatio Sancti Antonii (Bosch) ","title":"The Temptation of St Anthony (Bosch painting)"},{"id":"7448015","text":"Richard Beesly (27 July 1907 ‚Äì 28 March 1965) was a British rower who won an Olympic gold medal at the 1928 Summer Olympics.

Located in downtown San Francisco, California, GGU is a California non-profit corporation and is fully accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA). ==History== GGU Campus GGU Law was founded in the autumn of 1901 as the YMCA Evening Law School, a component of the San Francisco Central YMCA Evening College. Classes were held in the YMCA's building at Mason and Ellis Streets in the Tenderloin, which was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Like other YMCA Law Schools across the nation, it was established to provide people who worked full-time the opportunity to attend law school at night. The first graduating class in June 1905 had four students (all men). After the earthquake, the school was conducted out of tents, and later leased space at 1220 Geary St. (now Geary Boulevard) near Franklin Street in the Western Addition neighborhood. For the purpose of conferring the LL.B degree under authority of law the school was incorporated as the Young Men's Christian Association Law College on June 1, 1910. With the rest of the YMCA the law college moved to its purpose-built home at 220 Golden Gate Ave, near Leavenworth Street, again in the Tenderloin in November 1910. The Law College's graduates enjoyed the diploma privilege from 1915 to its abolition in 1917. The YMCA Golden Gate School of Law along with the rest of the local \\"Y\\"'s educational programs was formally incorporated separately from the San Francisco Central YMCA in April 1923, as Golden Gate College. The school moved to its present location, a 1924 warehouse known as the \\"Allyne Building\\" at 536 Mission Street, near 1st Street in the South of Market district in December 1964, with the rest of the college moving there in June 1968. The law school added a full-time three-year day program in September 1966. Following the national trend, the school replaced the Bachelor of Laws with the Doctor of Jurisprudence on December 1, 1967 with effect from Spring 1968 The School of Law held provisional accreditation from the American Bar Association longer than any other in history‚Äîfrom August 30, 1956 until July 6, 1971, at which time full approval was granted. The college elevated to university status and became Golden Gate University in 1972, with Golden Gate University School of Law as its law school. ==Programs and accreditation== Lecture Hall The school offers a first degree in law (J.D.) and first graduate degrees in law (LL.M., and doctoral S.J.D.) programs in intellectual property, environmental law, taxation, U.S. legal studies and international law. Students also may earn combined degrees: J.D./M.B.A. with Golden Gate University's Ageno School of Business or J.D./Ph.D. with Palo Alto University. The school has been accredited by the American Bar Association since August 1956. Additionally it has been accredited by the Committee of Bar Examiners of the State Bar of California since 1940. It is also a member of the Association of American Law Schools (AALS). Graduates qualify to take the bar exam in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. On an institution-wide basis, Golden Gate University has been fully accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) since 1959. (It had been accredited by what is now the Northwest Association of Accredited Schools from 1950.) The Public Interest Scholars Program includes the Environmental Law and Justice Clinic, Veteran's Legal Advocacy Center, and the Women's Employment Rights Clinic. In 1978, the law school developed a graduate legal program in taxation and in the 1990s graduate programs in environmental law, an International Legal Studies Program, and U.S. legal studies. I The school's Environmental Law and Justice Clinic was founded in 1994. It provides pro bono legal support to communities suffering from pollution. It has received numerous awards for its collaboration with grassroots, regional, and national groups in effecting change, notably for bringing attention to the health disparities resulting from pollution concentrated in the Bayview Hunters-Point neighborhood of the City of San Francisco. The Clinic's work with other groups and the City of San Francisco resulted in the closure of two power plants and prevention of other power plants from being built in the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood of the City of San Francisco.Helen H.

Captain, U.S. Marine Corps Advisor (Attached), 1st Vietnamese Marine Corps Infantry Battalion Date of Action: July 11, 1972 :The Navy Cross is presented to Lawrence H. Livingston, Captain, U.S. Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism on 11 July 1972 while serving as Senior Advisor to the 1st Vietnamese Marine Corps Infantry Battalion during a heliborne assault into enemy-held territory northeast of Quang Tri City, Republic of Vietnam. When the battalion encountered unexpectedly heavy enemy fire while disembarking into the landing zone, and sustained numerous casualties, Captain Livingston moved throughout the hasty positions taken by the scattered and hesitant element and formed the Marines into an assault force. Despite the continuing heavy concentration of hostile fire, he began the assault on the initial objective - a treeline approximately 50 yards distant. Although blown from his feet by explosions and periodically delayed to reform and redirect his casualty-riddled force, he forged ahead, leading the Vietnamese Marines into the enemy-infested trench lines of the objective and a subsequent hand-to-hand battle. Upon seizure of the initial portion of the trench line, Captain Livingston shed his combat equipment, emerged from the trench line, and exposed himself to a hail of enemy fire to reach and carry his wounded naval gunfire spotter to a position of relative safety. Captain Livingston's repeated acts of heroism in the face of heavy enemy fire reflected great credit upon himself and the Marine Corps and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. ===Silver Star citation=== > The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting > the Silver Star to Captain Lawrence Herbert Livingston (MCSN: 0-107447), > United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in > action while serving in the Republic of Vietnam on 12 April 1972 as the > Assistant United States Marine Advisor to the First Infantry Battalion, > Vietnamese Marine Corps.

Marmarita is one of the largest villages in Wadi al-Nasara (\\"Valley of the Christians\\"), a region north of Talkalakh. In 2004, Marmarita had a population of 2,206, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Its inhabitants are predominantly Greek Orthodox Christians and is one of the largest Christian villages in the Wadi al-Nasara ('valley of the Christians'). Marmarita is a popular summer destination and tourist attraction in Syria. The village has been part of the Homs Governorate since 1953; prior to that, it was part of the Latakia Governorate. ==Etymology== The name Marmarita is believed to be derived from the Syriac word Marmanitha, meaning \\"a place that overlooks\\" in possible reference to Marmarita's situation above the Akkar Plateau and Mediterranean Sea. ==History== Marmarita was settled in the early 17th century by four farming families from Lebanon and the Hauran plateau. These families built three churches (St. John, St. Saba, and St. Boutros) which still remain on the outskirts of the village. Local folklore suggests that the site of the village may have been occupied as early as the 6th century CE, but any habitation was destroyed by a volcanic eruption of the Levant Fault zone.

Floor plan of the conference hall of the Chamber of Deputies Chamber of Deputies () was a parliamentary body in France in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: * 1814‚Äì1848 during the Bourbon Restoration and the July Monarchy, the Chamber of Deputies was the lower house of the French Parliament, elected by census suffrage. * 1875‚Äì1940 during the French Third Republic, the Chamber of Deputies was the legislative assembly of the French Parliament, elected by universal suffrage. When reunited with the Senate in Versailles, the French Parliament was called the National Assembly (Assembl√©e nationale) and carried out the election of the President of the French Republic. ==During the Bourbon Restoration== Created by the Charter of 1814 and replacing the Corps l√©gislatif, which existed under the First French Empire, the Chamber of Deputies was composed of individuals elected by census suffrage. Its role was to discuss laws and, most importantly, to vote taxes. According to the Charter, deputies were elected for five years, with one-fifth renewed each year. Deputies needed to be 40 years old and to pay 1000 francs in direct contributions. Government ministers could be chosen from among the deputies, and this resulted in giving the Restoration government a slight, albeit minor, parliamentary and liberal character. During the Hundred Days (les cent jours) return of Napoleon I in 1815, under the terms of the Additional Act to the Constitutions of the Empire, the Chamber of Deputies was briefly replaced by a Chamber of Representatives (Chambre des repr√©sentants). This body was dissolved upon the entry of Coalition troops into Paris on 7 July. For the period 1815‚Äì1816, the (then) Ultra-royalist chamber was referred to as the Chambre introuvable. ==During the July Monarchy== Conference hall of the Chamber of Deputies 1843 The Chamber of Deputies was elected by census suffrage according to the Charter of 1830. The political life of the July Monarchy was defined by the split within the Chamber of Deputies between the progressive movement (considered the Charter as a starting point) and the conservative wing (who refused any further modifications). Although both parties traded power in the initial stages, by 1840 the conservative members around Fran√ßois Guizot had seized control. From 1830, deputies were elected for five years. They needed to be 30 years old and to pay 500 francs in direct contributions. The king convoked the chamber every year, and he had the power to extend the parliamentary session or to dissolve the chamber, although in the latter case he was required to convoke a new chamber in three months time. In 1852, the Chamber of Deputies retook the name Corps l√©gislatif. ==See also== *Cabinet of France *Constitution of France *French Parliament *History of France *Politics of France ==External links== Category:French law Category:Government of France Category:Politics of France Category:Defunct lower houses Category:1814 establishments in France Category:1848 disestablishments in France Category:1875 establishments in France Category:1940 disestablishments in France ","title":"Chamber of Deputies (France)"},{"id":"7448084","text":"Kweda is a small town located in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, about east of the town of Brookton. ==History== The government was planning to build a railway line between Brookton and Kunjin (near Corrigin), in 1913, and one of the proposed stations was a \\"Quandadine Siding\\", located near Quandadine Pool in the Avon River.

In Moldavia, an ethnic Albanian, Vasile Lupu, became Prince in 1634. Albanians are called by Romanians today Albanezi, but in the past they were known as ArbƒÉnasi, the old ethnonym dating back to the Middle Ages.Kamusella, Tomasz (2009). The politics of language and nationalism in modern Central Europe. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan. p. 241. \\"Prior to the emergence of the modern self-ethnonym Shqiptar√´ in the mid-16th century (for the first time it was recorded in 1555 by the Catholic Gheg, Gjon Buzuku, in his missal), North Albanians (Ghegs) referred to themselves as Arb√´n, and South Albanians (Tosks) Arb√´r. Hence, the self-ethnonym Arb√´resh√´ of the present-day Italo-Albanians (numbering about 100,000) in southern Italy and Sicily, whose ancestors, in the wake of the Ottoman wars, emigrated from their homeland in the 14th century. These self-ethnonyms perhaps influenced the Byzantine Greek Arvanites for ‚ÄòAlbanians,‚Äô which was followed by similar ones in Bulgarian and Serbian (Arbanasi), Ottoman (Arnaut), Romanian (ArbƒÉnas), and Aromanian (Arbine≈ü). The Albanian community was strengthened during the Phanariote epoch, when numerous immigrants opened businesses in a large number of cities and towns, and were employed as bodyguards of Wallachian princes and boyars (being usually recorded as ArbƒÉna»ôi, akin to Arvanites, and its variant ArnƒÉu»õi, borrowed from the Turkish Arnavut).Giurescu, pp. 267, 272. In 1820, a survey indicated that there were 90 traders from the Rumelian town of Arnaut Kioy present in the Wallachian capital, most of whom were probably Albanians and Aromanians.Giurescu, p. 267. The Rilindja Komb√´tare movement of Albanian nationalism inside the Ottoman Empire was present and prolific in Wallachia, the center of cultural initiatives taken by Dora d'Istria, Naim Frash√´ri, Jani Vreto, and Naum Veqilharxhi (the latter published the first ever Albanian primer in Bucharest, in 1844). Aleksand√´r Stavre Drenova, a resident of Bucharest, authored the lyrics of Albania's national anthem, Hymni i Flamurit, which is sung to the tune of Pe-al nostru steag e scris Unire, composed by the Romanian Ciprian Porumbescu. At the time, Albanians were present, alongside other Balkan communities, in Bucharest's commercial life, where many worked as street vendors (specializing in the sale of soft drinks or confectionery items).Giurescu, pp. 168, 307. The newspaper Sqipetari/Albanezul, published by the Albanian community (1889) Albanian schoolbook printed in Bucharest in 1887 Among the new groups of immigrants from various Balkan regions to Romania were the families of poets Victor Eftimiu and Lasgush Poradeci. At the time, the independence movement gathered momentum, and, for a while after 1905, was focused on the activities of Albert Gjika. An Albanian school was opened in 1905 in the city of Constan»õa -- among its pupils was poet Aleksand√´r Stavre Drenova. In 1912, at a Bucharest meeting headed by Ismail Qemali and attended by Drenova, the first resolution regarding Albania's independence was adopted. In 1893, the Albanian community in Romania numbered around 30,000 persons. In 1920 almost 20,000 Albanians lived in Bucharest. A new wave of Albanian immigrants, many of them Muslims from Yugoslavia, followed in the wake of World War I.George Grigore, \\"Muslims in Romania\\" , in International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World (ISIM) Newsletter 3, July 1999, p. 34; retrieved July 16, 2007. In 1921, the first translation of the Qur'an into Albanian was completed by Ilo Mitk√´ Qaf√´zezi and published in the city of Ploie≈üti. Many Albanians settled in Transylvania, where they generally established confectionery enterprises. The community was repressed under the communist regime, starting in 1953 (when the Albanian cultural association was closed down). Rights lost were regained after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, but the number of people declaring themselves Albanian has decreased dramatically between 1920 and 2002. Traditionally, members of the community have been included among a special \\"among others\\" category in the censuses. The community gained a seat in the Chamber of Deputies in 1996 when the Cultural Union of Albanians of Romania entered Parliament. In 2000 the community's seat was taken by the League of Albanians of Romania, who have held it since. ==Notable Albanian-Romanians Prime Ministers === *Victor Ponta - Romanian jurist and politician, who served as prime minister of Romania between his appointment by President Traian BƒÉsescu in May 2012 and his resignation in November 2015.

Wu's writings provide us with a glimpse of conditions just prior to the Manchu Qing conquest and especially descriptions of social conditions in rural society. Wu was from Taizhou, Jiangsu, an area already known for radical intellectualism. The area had once experienced economic prosperity, but by the 17th century was in decline. Wu lived in the midst of poverty in a dilapidated home with broken tiles. Members of the local community still attempted to uphold old standards of education and culture. The area was one of salt production and Wu's ancestors engaged in this profession. Wu himself engaged in variety of occupations. It is popular to view Wu, and others of his station, as hermits in protest against the newly established Manchu regime. Wu's accounts of China's new masters on a local level are of course revealing.

Polydymite crystallises in the isometric system, with a hardness of 4.5 to 5.5 and a specific gravity of about 4, is dark violet gray to copper-red, often with verdigris and patina from associated copper and arsenic sulfides, and is typically in amorphous to massive infill of lower saprolite ultramafic lithologies. Polydymite is the nickel equivalent of violarite and in many cases these two minerals are formed together, potentially in solid solution. Common contaminants of polydymite are cobalt and iron. Polydymite forms a series with linnaeite, Co+2Co+32S4.Linnaeite-Polydymite Series == Paragenesis == Polydymite is formed by oxidisation of primary sulfide assemblages in nickel sulfide mineralisation. The process of formation involves oxidation of Ni2+ and Fe2+ which is contained within the primary pentlandite-pyrrhotite- pyrite assemblage. Continued oxidation of polydymite leads to replacement by goethite and formation of a gossanous boxwork, with nickel tending to remain as impurities within the goethite or hematite, or rarely as carbonate minerals. == Occurrence == Polydymite is reported widely from the oxidised regolith above primary nickel sulfide ore systems worldwide. It is less common than related violarite, due to the high iron content of most primary sulfides. === Economic importance === Polydymite is an important transitional ore in many nickel sulfide mines, as it has increased nickel tenor (Ni% as a total of sulfide) and occupies a position within the mineralised profile where it must be extracted to pay for development down to the more valuable primary (hypogene) mineralisation. == References == Category:Nickel minerals Category:Thiospinel group Category:Cubic minerals ","title":"Polydymite"},{"id":"7448265","text":"Medine Zaouiche (born 24 February 1983 in Le Havre), better known by his stage name M√©dine, is a French-Algerian rapper He has been a part of the hip-hop collective La Boussole since 1996.

Portrayed by Melina Kanakaredes, Stella appeared in six seasons of CSI: NY, after which she was replaced by Jo Danville, played by Sela Ward. == Background == The character of Stella Bonasera is Mac Taylor's second-in-command in the fictional New York Police Department's crime lab of the television show CSI: New York. Throughout various episodes, the writers of the show have revealed that Bonasera began her career working as a patrol officer and once worked Narcotics out of Brooklyn North. She is portrayed as a character with a bold personality, and her unflagging determination to solve a crime has earned the character at least four complaints on her record as a result. Her badge number is \\"8946\\". == Early life == Stella is a half-Greek, half-Italian orphan (though she identifies more with her Greek side) who grew up at St. Basil's Orphanage. She left when she was eighteen (episode 115, \\"Til Death Do We Part\\"). In the season 5 episode \\"Grounds for Deception\\", it is revealed that Stella's mother was a restoration painter from Naousa who brought two-year-old Stella with her when she came to New York with an exhibit. Soon after the exhibit, her mother was killed in a traffic accident. Stella is fluent in Greek and has spoken some Italian on the Can You Hear Me Now episode (Season 4, episode 1). She has briefly read a Cyrillic Russian message in the Blink episode (Season 1, episode 1) and also briefly spoke in Russian with a spray-on pantyhose suspect in the Run Silent, Run Deep episode (Season 2, episode 20). She was in foster care in her early life. It is revealed that a professor, whom Stella was close to, got her out of foster care. Stella is also religious and can be seen crossing herself with holy water in a church (episode 8, \\"Three Generations Are Enough). == Relationships == Stella's personal life was the subject of a few episodes in Season Two. A boyfriend named Frankie Mala first appeared in the second episode of Season Two, \\"Grand Murder at Central Station\\", and he appeared occasionally throughout the rest of the season. In an episode late in Season Two entitled \\"All Access\\", after discovering that Frankie had secretly taped them making love and uploaded the footage to the internet, Stella broke off their relationship. In the same episode, Frankie breaks into her apartment shortly after and takes Stella hostage. Stella manages to free herself and, fearing for her life, is forced to kill Frankie with her service weapon in self- defense. In \\"Dancing With The Fishes\\", when examining the case of a dancer who falls from New York's only tram onto a car below, Stella notices the bunions and toe injuries and reveals that she was a student of jazz, tap and ballet, and later demonstrates this knowledge in a short basic sequence of dance steps which leaves both Mac and Flack impressed. When Drew Bedford wanted to take revenge on Mac for the death of his brother when they were young, he tried to make Stella fall for him to get closer to Mac. This effort turned out to be in vain, because, relying on her gut, Stella told him that she is \\"not looking for a relationship.\\" In Season 5, episode 503, \\"Turbulence\\", she is seen to be with a firefighter, Brandon Walsh, for a softball practice. Later in episode 515, \\"The Party's Over\\", she takes Walsh as her escort to an event. Stella cares deeply for all the members of her team. She is very close to Mac Taylor as well as Don Flack and constantly worries about their well-being. She and Mac have one of the noticeably closest relationships on the show. Stella acts as his right hand, the most senior member of his team aside from himself. They are so close that, in preparation for a date with a woman he met in a coffee shop, Mac allows Stella to remove his tie at the end of episode 123 (\\"What You See Is What You See\\"). In episode 224 \\"Charge of this Post\\", she stays with him at the hospital to watch over the injured Don Flack. Considering how uptight Mac had been during the course of the first season, this can be seen as a very trusting, if not intimate, gesture. In episode 109 \\"Officer Blue\\", during which Mac and Stella had one of their most heated fights, he admitted that he \\"honestly wouldn't do this job\\" without her, when they reconciled at the end of episode. Mac was also the only person (other than Adam, the lab rat who ran the test secretly) whom she told about her fear when she was suspected to have HIV, in episode 317 \\"The Ride-In\\". During Season 5, it is revealed that Professor Papakota, a Greek antiquities expert whom Stella regards as a father figure, is involved in stealing antiquities. Stella, against the advice of Mac, returns to the land of her birth to find and track him down. Along with \\"Officer Blue\\", \\"Grounds for Deception\\" is when Stella has one of her biggest fights with Mac. She later also finds out that the painting in her office ‚Äì which Papakota had given her upon graduation from the police academy ‚Äì had actually been stolen by Professor P. After she returns the painting, she finds out about her mother's identity from Mac, who had followed her to Greece. When Peyton broke up with Mac, Stella went to the club where Mac plays his bass guitar, and exchanged an understanding smile with him. Mac offered his guest room, when Stella's apartment caught in the fire in episode 416 \\"Right Next Door\\", to which she declined reasoning that she snores. In episode 516 \\"No Good Deed\\", Mac took Stella for a cup of coffee to \\"fish some advice\\", when they were interrupted with an eyeball that dropped into Stella's cup. Later, Mac told Stella the trouble he had with Ella McBride, the girl who attempted to kill herself in 511 \\"Forbidden Fruit\\". Stella give him his advice back, telling him that he cannot save everyone, to which he said that he \\"just need to hear it\\" from her. Stella is also protective of the rest of her colleagues. During episode 311, \\"Raising Shane\\", a police captain who dislikes character Danny Messer harasses him at a crime scene, calling Danny a felon and hinting that he would have him dismissed. Stella steps in and tells the captain to stop threatening her team or she'd go after the captain's badge. After Sheldon Hawkes is cleared of the crime that he was framed for in the same episode, Stella is the first person to greet him when he is released. Stella has also built a strong friendship with fellow CSI Lindsay Monroe. Stella is hurt when Lindsay refuses to share her troubles in episode 312, \\"Silent Night\\", but when Lindsay later comes to her and asks for a friend, Stella responds immediately, \\"You've got one.\\" When Lindsay must return to Montana to testify in a murder trial, Stella, not Mac, is the one she informs first. Just a few minutes before the trial begins, Lindsay calls her to talk to her and Stella comforts her. Stella also shows a fondness for Lindsay's enthusiastic explanations of evidence and occasional demonstrations, usually with a remark along the lines of \\"I love it when she does this.\\" She also gave Lindsay a form of assurance that she has good coworkers, who will understand and be happy for her, when in her anxiousness over her pregnancy and getting exposed to chemical substances in the lab, the younger woman asks her about the security procedure for a pregnant friend of her in Jersey. At the end of the conversation, Stella said to Lindsay to tell her friend \\"congratulations\\", indicating that she knows that Lindsay is actually the one who was pregnant. When Lindsay and Danny got married in episode 517, \\"Green Piece\\", Stella and Mac were there as witnesses. Stella is also good friends with Det. Don Flack. They often work cases together and she appreciates his sense of humor. In episode 221, \\"All Access\\", Flack is especially gentle with Stella when he comes to take her statement following her hostage ordeal. He tells her she is a friend and she responds that he is a \\"very good friend.\\" In \\"Charge of This Post\\" (episode 224), she takes turns with the other team members staying at Flack's bedside as he recovers from his near-fatal injuries from a bomb blast. It is hinted at that she and Flack have known each other for longer than her time as a CSI. Though, to Flack's surprise, she admitted that she plays Poker while investigating a crime scene at a Poker game on the Bad Beat (season 2, episode 8) episode. On the Risk (season 2, episode 13) episode, Stella reveals her frugality that she puts in her bank account whatever she doesn't spend, while discussing with Flack about the stock market during the investigation of a stockbroker found hanging outside his high rise office window. Stella is also hinted to have been flirty with Miami-Dade PD Lt. Horatio Caine during the CSI: NY and CSI: Miami crossover episode \\"Manhattan Manhunt\\" where they work together to find a notorious killer. In episode 601 \\"Epilogue\\", she has a one night stand with Adam Ross. A few days later, they discuss that it was wonderful, but better left un-repeated. == In the line of duty == Of the four complaints on her record, two are from felons subsequently imprisoned, one is from a murder suspect released because of an error by an ADA, and the fourth is filed in \\"Supply and Demand\\" (episode 120) by the father of a college student suspected of selling drugs that had already killed a fellow student. The insinuation is that Stella is willing to push a suspect's buttons in an effort to get a confession or information. Stella does not suffer fools gladly. During \\"Open and Shut\\" (episode 306), she initially expresses sympathy for a woman who appears to be the only survivor of a double homicide in her home. After further investigation reveals that the woman is not the victim but actually the mastermind of the crime, Stella is furious and confronts the woman in the interrogation room. When the woman smugly compares her situation to Stella's with Frankie, Stella counters that their situations were nothing alike: Stella had been a victim who acted out of self-defense, while the woman was a cold-blooded murderer who wanted to escape what she hinted was a bad marriage. In episode 202, \\"Grand Murder at Central Station\\", she is plainly disgusted by the murder suspect's belittling of his blind victim. In episode 316, \\"Heart of Glass\\", Stella accidentally cuts herself on a piece of glass while processing a crime scene, potentially exposing herself to the victim's HIV-positive blood. Though she immediately cleans and bandanges the wound, as well as starting an anti-viral regimen, she cannot know for several months whether she has contracted HIV. The uncertainty has already interfered with her life, as when she refuses to let Hawkes touch her after a suspect smashes the one-way mirror in the interrogation room and Stella is cut on the cheek by a shard of the broken mirror. Stella's timely arrival in the autopsy room, as well as her administration of epinephrine, is critical in saving the life of coroner Sid Hammerback, who suffers a severe allergic reaction to a sandwich he had eaten earlier. Later, Stella expresses her concern to Hammerback that she may have exposed him to HIV when she administered CPR, but he is simply grateful to her and happy to be alive (episode 317, \\"The Ride In\\"). By episode 320, \\"What Schemes May Come\\", she expresses a desire to know once and for all whether or not she is HIV-positive. Stella asks Mac to requisition the necessary supplies for a PCR DNA test, which will provide faster results than the standard tests. As the lab already has the facilities required and someone (specifically lab tech Adam Ross) qualified to perform the tests, Mac approves the expense. Adam later performs the test, and she learns, to her elation, that she is HIV-negative (episode 321, \\"Past Imperfect\\"). Stella's blood is accidentally entered into CODIS due to a lab tech error during her PCR DNA test. Philadelphia Homicide gets a hit for it in a cold case involving some bloody clothes found buried along a highway. The Cold Case Squad sends out Detective Scotty Valens (played by Danny Pino) to investigate and question Stella's involvement. Despite his initial threat of handcuffing her, he eventually clears her of culpability in the matter. After he leaves New York, Stella figures out the true culprit is her foster sister. She locates the woman, who is living under an alias, and, while she does confront her, Stella does not immediately cuff her, but gives her a day to flee. It is unknown how much she later reveals to Detective Valens (episode 322, \\"Cold Reveal\\"). Stella and her colleagues attempt to defend Mac Taylor on the stand after the senior CSI comes under fire for his supposed culpability in the death of kidnapper/murderer Clay Dobson. She is forced to admit that Mac violated department procedures when he charged alone after Dobson. However, Stella later advises Mac to learn to play politics, as that is what the trumped-up charges are all about. After Mac is cleared, she congratulates him on a game well-played, but agree that this is likely not the last time he will be put under the microscope (episode 323, \\"...Comes Around\\"). In episode 701, \\"The 34th Floor\\", it is revealed that Stella has moved to New Orleans and is head of their crime lab. == External links == * Episode 322 \\"Cold Reveal\\" crossover with Cold Case Category:CSI: NY characters Category:Fictional New York City Police Department detectives Category:Fictional female detectives Category:Fictional forensic scientists Category:Fictional scientists Category:Fictional Greek people Category:Fictional orphans Category:Television characters introduced in 2004 ","title":"Stella Bonasera"},{"id":"7448282","text":"Arthur S. Martin (died 1 February 1996) was a member of the British intelligence community and a primary investigator in the spy scandals in the post-war era. ==Biography== Martin became head of the D1 Section of D Branch (Investigations) of the Security Service (henceforth MI5) in 1960, and worked with Peter Wright on various investigations, including those into Roger Hollis and Anthony Blunt. These events are described in detail in Nigel West's Molehunt and Peter Wright's Spycatcher. In 1964, Michael Straight admitted to Arthur Martin and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that Anthony Blunt had recruited him in the mid-1930s, while both were at Cambridge University. Straight was an American who had been at Cambridge with several of the Cambridge spies. John Cairncross, alleged by many to be \\"The Fifth Man\\", also admitted to Martin that he was an associate of Blunt and that he had passed papers to the Soviet government. Martin set up a meeting with Blunt on 23 April 1964. At that meeting, Blunt admitted that he had worked for the Soviet government. Blunt was later interrogated by Peter Wright. Russell Aiuto. All about the Cambridge Spies In 1964, Labour leader Harold Wilson became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Prior to the election, the FBI told MI5 they had discovered a KGB or GRU mole working in MI5, while MI5 had been trying to recruit Wilson's campaign manager, George Gaunt, to spy on Wilson. After Blunt confessed, it was clear that his position and his social and political connections posed a serious threat to the credibility of MI5. Compounding this was that MI5 had been informed of the presence of a mole ten years earlier, but had not responded appropriately. The Director General during this time, Roger Hollis, said that he felt Wilson's government would use this information against MI5 if the incoming government found out. Hollis and Martin decided to engage in a cover-up. They offered Anthony Blunt immunity instead, and he confessed when interviewed by Martin. This cover-up was also confirmed by Peter Wright. Later, when Hollis and his deputy, Graham Mitchell, fell under suspicion of being GRU moles, Wilson was not informed.

He was originally the sultry voiced medical examiner during the first season, but moves into the field in the start of the second season, much to the initial surprise of head CSI Mac Taylor. ==Background== Hawkes was a child prodigy who graduated from college at eighteen, and by 24 he was a fully licensed board certified surgeon. After a tumultuous surgical career in which he was often at odds with his boss and after losing two patients on the operating table (shown in flashback in episode 309, \\"And Here's To You, Mrs Azrael\\"), he abandoned surgery in favor of the medical examiner's office. He evidently sleeps at the morgue sometimes, as he has a cot there in episode 103, \\"American Dreamers.\\" In season 2 he moves out of the morgue and becoming an invaluable member of the investigation team both in the lab and the field. His badge number is \\"9010\\". Due to his medical background, he is sometimes referred to as \\"Doc\\" by his colleagues. In \\"Blood Actually\\", Sheldon had a disagreement with Danny Messer regarding a heavy-set victim at a crime scene they were investigating. But later, Sheldon showed Danny a picture of himself that he was overweight and later lost the weight to impress a girl, reminding Danny that what's on the inside of a person is what really counts. ==On the job== Hawkes is a sympathetic soul who is willing to lend an ear to anyone who needs to talk. During \\"Murder Sings the Blues\\" (episode 307) he is shown in flashback to have met a girl at a party. The girl felt unhappy, so Hawkes took her out for a cup of coffee and listened to her tell him her troubles. Afterwards, he gave her his phone number if she ever felt like she needed to talk to him again. The girl is found dead two weeks later on board a subway car following a rave party, with Hawkes' phone number still on her person. Hawkes, when he discovers his phone number in the girl's possession, neglects to tell Mac about his connection to her, which earns him a dressing- down from Mac in front of the entire lab. Later, Hawkes apologizes to Mac for not disclosing how he knew the victim and tells his story. Their relationship has clearly mended by episode 309 (\\"And Here's To You, Mrs Azrael\\"), when Mac confides about his father's lingering death from cancer, and Sheldon comforts him. This dialogue also indicates that Hawkes is opposed to euthanasia. On a few episodes, such as \\"Hammer Down\\", \\"It Happened To Me\\", and \\"Scared Stiff\\", Dr. Hawkes tends to get emotional when a murder is medical-related, or if the suspect happens to be a doctor. Hawkes has been the victim of racism while out in the field especially in dealings with white supremacist Micheal Elgers. In \\"Green Piece\\", Hawkes investigating the bombing of a house, is led to Elgers who is adorned with Nazi tattoos all over his body and other white power propaganda is discovered in Elgers' apartment. Elgers lays into Hawkes calling him inferior, an affirmative action case, but Hawkes stands his ground. In \\"Yahrzeit\\", Hawkes is faced with the death of his uncle and plans to fly to Michigan for the funeral, however the flight is delayed and Hawkes decides to help the team investigate the murder of an auctioneer. He offers to assist Danny Messer with Messer informing his friend that he's about to question Micheal Elgers. Hawkes defiantly states, \\"He's a vicious racist and that's his problem\\". Elgers once again targets Hawkes for being black, but like before, Hawkes maintains composure. Hawkes remains in New York long enough to see Elgers arrested for crimes unrelated to the murder before taking his flight to be with his family to honor his uncle. ===Trouble with the killer Shane Casey=== In episode 304, \\"Hung Out To Dry,\\" Hawkes is targeted by killer Shane Casey. Several years before, when Hawkes was the M.E., his testimony helped send Shane's brother, Ian, to jail for a robbery-homicide at a neighborhood pub. Ian Casey committed suicide while awaiting sentencing and Shane blamed several people, including Hawkes. Shane murders the jury foreperson and a witness to Ian's original crime before the team makes the connection to Hawkes and the previous case. In the episode \\"Raising Shane,\\" (3.11) Shane orchestrates a plot that implicates Hawkes in a robbery-homicide in deliberate imitation of Ian's case. Shane demands that the team find evidence to prove Ian's innocence in return for the evidence that will exonerate Hawkes. Though the team is assigned to a different case because of a conflict of interest, they find that the new case is, strangely enough, connected to Hawkes', and through the team's diligence, they are able to help clear Hawkes' name and secure his freedom, as well as prove Ian Casey's guilt in a twist of tragic irony and Shane was arrested. On his release, Sheldon is warmly embraced by Stella Bonasera. In \\"Redemptio\\" (6.19), Hawkes finds himself in Casey's crosshairs again in 2010 inadvertently when Hawkes travels to Pennsylvania to witness the execution of killer and drug dealer Reginald Tiford. Tiford was suspected by the Hawkes' family of having killed Sheldon's sister in 1999. A corrections officer dies shortly before the execution is carried out. Hawkes suspects Tiford of THIS murder to delay the sentence. A full prison riot erupts with Hawkes spotting Casey in the prison's general population. Tiford earlier pleaded with Hawkes that he was not responsible for Hawkes's sister's death. Tiford becomes Sheldon's most unlikely ally during the riot even delivering a prison jumpsuit so Hawkes could blend in. The murdered C.O. is discovered to have died from cyanide poisoning and while Hawkes and Tiford are in Casey's cell investigating they discover Casey formulated the cyanide from grinding up peach seeds and extracting the cyanide before Casey tainted the guard's food. Casey with help from a guard he's blackmailing changes into an NYPD patrol officer's uniform and escapes in full view of the Pennsylvania State Police. Tiford attempts to subdue Casey before his escape but Casey adorned in a police officer's dress is allowed to leave after killing Tiford to free the man believed to be a cop. Hawkes runs out of the prison to save Tiford but he too is restrained as his own dress makes him look like another inmate. Hawkes tries to explain but is still detained allowing Casey to escape and resume his reign of terror on Hawkes and the Messer family. Upon release, Hawkes visits his sister's gravesite with flowers in a fog of regret that he did not do much to save her. While investigating the death of a diving instructor, Sheldon briefly becomes trapped underwater. Despite being injured and suffering from hypoxia, Sheldon is freed with the help of fellow CSI Danny Messer, who was diving with him. After they are safe, Hawkes admits that he envisioned coroner Sid Hammerback preparing to do an autopsy on him (episode 402, \\"The Deep\\"). At the start of season 6, the rest of the team notices how Sheldon appears distracted and insisting on working overtime a lot. In episode 606 \\"It Happened to Me,\\" he's staying on the couch of a friend's apartment when the man is arrested for embezzlement. Sheldon claims he was just crashing for the night but Flack and Mac don't believe him. Chasing a suspect in the killing of a man who stole from his company, Sheldon talks the suicidal man down by revealing the truth: He has lost all his savings in a fraud scheme and was forced to sell his house. He confesses he was ashamed to tell anyone and Stella informs him he can count on friends for help. Proving her words, Mac lets Sheldon stay at his guest room until he gets back on his feet. On a later episode, Hawkes has revealed that he is moving to a new residence, while Mac joked about getting his sofa/couch back. ==Personal life== In episode 512, it was revealed that an ex-girlfriend of Hawkes' was a victim of a serial rapist years ago. The aftermath of the event led their relationship to fall apart. When the rapist strikes another victim, Hawkes becomes furious and a little obsessed with finding the rapist and putting him away, leading him to clash with Mac over the methods of obtaining evidence and over Hawkes' personal connection to one of the victims. He is removed from the case as a result. The rapist is eventually caught by Stella. In episode 522, Sheldon reminisces to Danny Messer about his just-deceased uncle Frank, who had witnessed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., and whose dignified resilience to racism, and pride in his nephew, had been formative in Sheldon's life. That pride was on full display at the uncle's house when upon graduating from med school, Frank placed a sign on his house reading THIS IS THE HOME OF THE UNCLE OF DOCTOR SHELDON HAWKES. In the episode \\"Hammer Down\\", Sheldon displays his anger while interrogating a suspect with Flack. Being a doctor who had lost all of his savings in a scheme, he berated the suspect, who is also a doctor, for using the female victims' organs and body parts for transplanting, among other things for money while Flack watches. \\"Hammer Down\\" is part of the CSI trilogy in which Dr. Raymond Langston (played by Laurence Fishburne), of the Las Vegas Crime Lab investigates the kidnapping of a young woman in Miami, who was later believed to have been taken from Las Vegas. ===New girl-friend Camille Jordanson=== On the episode \\"Food For Thought\\", the usually reliable and smart Sheldon calls in sick so he can go on a date with an old friend Camille Jordanson, who was involved in a crime and kidnapped in the episode Smooth Criminal.\\"'Smooth Criminal' Episode Recap\\". TV.com. Retrieved April 10, 2011. The informal dinner date turns into an explosive crime scene. After one night of partying, Sheldon showed up late for work as Danny covers for him. He was later tested positive for cannabis sativa, which was determined by Mac. Mac gave Sheldon a mild scolding about his faking sick and the test result. But, Sheldon argued that the marijuana, which was found on Camille's bedside, was passive or second-hand. And that Sheldon has not had time for a personal life due to the high demands of his job. Mac lectured Sheldon about the oath they took that comes with their jobs, and tells Sheldon to go home and get some sleep. Camille shows up at Sheldon's place for another night. Camille is never seen or mentioned again; their relationship afterwards is unknown. It is suggested that they either broke up or Camille slowed down as he was never scolded again. ==Relationship with colleagues== Hawkes is shown to be an amiable character who is well-liked by colleagues and passionate about the job. He is good friends with Danny Messer and the two are sometimes seen joking with new members of the team (new Homicide Detective Angell in season 3 \\"People With Money\\" and new CSI Detective Jo Danville in the season 7 opener). Although he has let his personal life interfere with his work on several occasions, he still maintains good working relationships with the rest of the team, especially his supervisor Mac. == References == Category:CSI: NY characters Category:Fictional African-American people Category:Fictional physicians Category:Fictional medical examiners Category:Fictional scientists Category:Television characters introduced in 2004 ","title":"Sheldon Hawkes"},{"id":"7448419","text":"Kami () is an Indo-Aryan Nepali speaking group.

It also served as an affiliate of the Prime Network from 1988 to 1996. Based in Detroit, Michigan, the channel broadcast regional coverage of sports events throughout Michigan, mainly covering professional, collegiate and high school sports in the Metro Detroit area and throughout Michigan. ==History== The network launched in 1982, as one of the first regional sports networks in the United States. Originally headquartered in Troy, PASS was owned by William Wischman, who at the time also owned independent station WXON (channel 20, now MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYD). When the network (which operated as a premium service) launched, PASS initially included some Major League Baseball games involving the Detroit Tigers, NBA games featuring the Detroit Pistons, and hockey games from the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. In 1984, Wischman sold the network to then-Tigers owner Tom Monaghan, who subsequently moved its operations into offices located in Ann Arbor at the headquarters of Domino's Pizza. In 1985, Detroit Red Wings games were added to the network's sports programming slate, with the remainder of the team's games being shown on independent station WKBD (channel 50, now a CW owned-and-operated station). In 1988, PASS became an early charter affiliate of the Prime Network group of regional sports networks. In 1992, Monaghan sold the Tigers to Mike Ilitch and sold PASS to Post-Newsweek Stations. PASS merged its operations with NBC affiliate WDIV-TV (channel 4), which is still owned by what is now Graham Media Group. Following the purchase, PASS moved its studios and offices from Ann Arbor to WDIV-TV's studios in Detroit. Post-Newsweek also changed it from an evening-only premium cable channel to a basic cable channel and expanded it to 24 hours a day.. In the fall of 1995, PASS expanded its coverage area, adding providers such as C-TEC and Cable Plus. By April 1996, the network had reached 25% (or 22,700) of all cable television households in Metro Detroit and 80% (or 174,000 households) in other parts of its primary coverage area through expanded basic tiers. ===Decline and shutdown=== On October 31, 1995, Liberty Media, owner of the Prime Network and most of its affiliates, sold a 50% ownership interest in the group to News Corporation. That company would immediately assume operational control of Prime following the purchase's closure, with plans to launch its own slate of regional sports networks as an outgrowth of its fledgling Fox Sports division later announcing on July 3, 1996, that the Prime networks would be rebranded as Fox Sports Net beginning that November. In 1997, Fox/Liberty Networks ‚Äì a newly formed joint venture between News Corporation and Liberty ‚Äì made a surprise bid for the local cable television rights to NHL games involving the Detroit Red Wings. News Corporation announced plans to launch its own regional sports network for Michigan to serve as a competitor to PASS. The new channel, later named Fox Sports Detroit, was originally targeted for a 1998 launch. As the respective broadcast rights to the Detroit Pistons and Detroit Tigers came up for renewal, Fox/Liberty made a joint bid with PASS for the contracts and was awarded the regional television rights to both teams on August 26, 1997. Post- Newsweek concluded that its coverage area was not large enough to support two regional sports networks. As a result, on August 30, 1997, it chose to sell the remainder of the Tigers and Pistons contracts for the 1998 season and the contract of sportscaster John Keating to Fox Sports Detroit. Fox/Liberty Networks ultimately decided to accelerate the launch date of the new channel in time for the 1997‚Äì98 NHL season and 1998 Major League Baseball season, the respective seasons in which the Red Wings and Tigers contracts began. Post- Newsweek then announced that it would shut down PASS. The last program to air on the network was Trackside at Ladbroke DRC. The Pro-Am Sports System ceased operations at 12:00 a.m. on November 1, 1997, following a public service announcement for the National Ski Hall of Fame in Ishpeming, a slide of the PASS logo was shown for two hours after the network formally shut down. In addition to Keating (who still works for Fox Sports Detroit), several other announcers and hosts that have worked for PASS moved over to Fox Sports Detroit, some of whom remain with that network to this day. ==On-air staffFormer on-air staff=== * Marty Adler ‚Äì Live on PASS host * Pat Caputo ‚Äì Live on PASS host (1990‚Äì1992) * Bill Freehan ‚Äì Tigers analyst (1984‚Äì1985) * Steve Garagiola ‚Äì Live on PASS host (1993‚Äì1996) * Ernie Harwell ‚Äì Tigers play- by-play announcer (1994‚Äì1996) * John Keating ‚Äì Live on PASS host (1993‚Äì1996) * Greg Kelser ‚Äì Pistons analyst (1993‚Äì1996) * Fred McLeod ‚Äì Pistons play-by-play announcer (1984‚Äì1996) * Jim Northrup ‚Äì Tigers analyst (1985‚Äì1994) * Larry Osterman ‚Äì Tigers and CCHA Hockey play-by-play announcer (1984‚Äì1992) * Jim Price ‚Äì Tigers analyst (1993‚Äì1996) * Mickey Redmond ‚Äì Red Wings analyst (1985‚Äì1996) * Jack Riggs ‚Äì horse racing play-by-play announcer and trackside host * Dave Strader ‚Äì Red Wings play-by-play announcer, CCHA play-by-play announcer (1985‚Äì1996) * Kelly Tripucka ‚Äì Pistons analyst (1993‚Äì1996) * Eli Zaret ‚Äì Tigers reporter ==References== Category:Sports in Detroit Category:Detroit Pistons broadcasters Category:Detroit Red Wings broadcasters Category:Detroit Tigers broadcasters Category:Prime Network Category:Television channels and stations established in 1984 Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 1997 Category:Defunct television networks in the United States Category:Defunct local cable stations in the United States Category:Defunct mass media in Michigan Category:Defunct mass media in Ohio Category:Defunct mass media in Indiana Category:Defunct mass media in Wisconsin Category:1984 establishments in Michigan Category:1997 disestablishments in Michigan ","title":"Pro-Am Sports System"},{"id":"7448450","text":"Louis Zorich (February 12, 1924 ‚Äì January 30, 2018) was an American actor.

On the island are the ruins of Yankee Town, which was the centre of industry on the island. Remains of a railroad still exist. At least two attempts have been made to purchase the entire island: The first was made by Dominican dictator Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo whose intent was to use it as a hideaway; however, he was assassinated before the purchase was made. The second occurred in 1972 when an oil company tried to purchase the island to build a refinery; though the deal was never made, the airstrip built by the company during the attempted purchase remains to this day.

The title's disclaimer states that it is in no way affiliated with or approved by the United States Secret Service. ==Premise== The player is an American Secret Service agent who must complete 16 single player missions. You start out as a rookie protecting government officials. As you gain experience from completing the operations, you will be assigned higher profile missions. The final mission is protecting the President of the United States. ==Gameplay== Secret Service is a first-person tactical shooter, similar to the Rainbow Six computer game series. Players must progress through a mission while accomplishing various mission objectives, such as eliminating terrorists or protecting dignitaries. The combat in Secret Service is slightly more forgiving than in many other tactical shooters, as the player can survive several bullet hits before dying (assuming they are equipped with heavy body armor), as opposed to dying after only 1 or 2 shots like in many other tactical shooters. The player's weapon is displayed in-game, unlike the earlier games in the Rainbow Six or Ghost Recon series. The game also features ragdoll physics. Before each mission, the player is able to prepare by selecting equipment (such as firearms or body armor), or positioning agents at various strategic locations within a map. The player is unable to pre-plan attack routes, however, and must navigate teammates during a mission in real- time. On most missions, players can be assisted by several computer-controlled Secret Service agents. There are two different types of Secret Service agents: teammates and static agents. Teammates are members of the player's fire team; the player leads them directly through a level, and issue them commands (such as attack or defend) using an in-game menu. Static agents are agents whom the player positions at various strategic locations within a mission during the mission preparation phase. The player has slightly less control over these agents, although they can still be issued in-game orders. The main purpose of static agents is to guard specific areas or serve as stationary snipers. ==Synopsis== The game begins in the Middle East, where the player is part of a protection detail for an American dignitary traveling through the region. The player must protect the dignitary from various attacks by local insurgents. After a few missions, the player returns to the United States, where they stumble upon a plot by major arms dealers to sell off 4 chemical weapons bombs to various terrorist groups. The game's remaining missions revolve around tracking down the arms dealers, as well as preventing the terrorist groups from using the chemical bombs against major targets. The game ends with a couple major missions. In one mission, the player must escort the Vice President out of a large hotel that is being attacked by every terrorist group the player had previously defeated.

Line Islands, Kiribati. They are in the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.. The bird was named in honor of Elliott Coues. ==Description== Female common gadwall. Streets' Washington Island specimens differed only in minor details (see text). A male and a female are known, which resemble the immature appearance of the common gadwall except for the black bill with a higher number of fuiltering lamellae, black feet, and the much inferior size (which may be due to the birds not being fully grown). The male resembles a male common gadwall in eclipse plumage, save for some white speckling on the breast and back. The female looks like a small common gadwall female; the primary wing coverts were not patterned black, and the inner web of the secondary remiges was grey instead of white. Measurements are: wing, 19.9 cm; bill, 3.7 cm; tarsus 3.6 cm. This means the birds were the size of a Cape teal or a garganey, with a total length of 40‚Äì45 cm. As the birds were not fully adult when shot, it is not clear whether they would not have grown a bit larger. ==Status and extinction== Teraina (Washington Island) The status of this bird is controversial. While many scientists consider it a dwarf subspecies of the common gadwall (Anas strepera strepera) others argue that the two individuals might have been just juveniles of a local breeding population that might not even have been taxonomically distinct. The common gadwall is a known vagrant to the Tuamotu Islands (Kolbe wrote \\"Tahiti which is a misreading of Greenway) and Hawaii for example, which are about the same distance from the species' breeding grounds, as is Teraina (which, moreover, lies in between these two groups). This makes it entirely possible that the two Coues's gadwalls that were shot were just the offspring of a few vagrant common gadwalls, maybe settling there after being wounded by hunters. On the other hand, Streets' reports suggest that there was a population of these ducks of some size present, and thus they may have lived there for quite some time and indeed be worthy of recognition as a distinct taxon. The observations of the two individuals took place in January 1874.Bulletin ‚Äì United States National Museum (1877) (description as Chaulelasmus couesi). United States National Museum; Smithsonian Institution; United States. Dept. of the Interior The subspecies' description was by Thomas Hale Streets (1847‚Äì1925) in 1876. Streets reported about the two immatures he shot, which were found in a peat bog. The cause of its extinction might be the extensive hunting by settlers of Tabuaeran (Fanning Island), which had shot large numbers of migrant ducks on both Teraina and Tabuaeran each year. W. G. Anderson, a local resident stated in 1926 that growing up on Teraina and Tabueran around the turn of the century, he had never encountered a native population of gadwalls on Teraina. Thus, the subspecies' disappearance can be fixed to the last quarter of the 19th century, between the mid-1870s and 1900. == Notes  References Further reading== * Fuller, Errol (2000): Extinct Birds (2nd ed.).

He is the main protagonist of the Tick franchise. ===Arthur=== Arthur is The Tick's sidekick. He is formally introduced in The Tick #4, but appears as a mysterious flying figure in the background of earlier issues of that series. Trained as an accountant, Arthur purchased his moth suit at an auction, and decided to pursue the life of a superhero (resulting in indefinite \\"psychiatric leave\\" from his accounting firm). After rescuing a powerful ninja artifact (the Thorn of Oblivion) and helping The Tick and Oedipus defeat the ninjas, Arthur decides to become The Tick's sidekick. As a running joke, Arthur is often mistaken for a bunny (owing to the shape and size of his costume's antennae, and the fact that his wings are usually folded up). His doughy physique, shy manner, lack of self- confidence, and hesitation in the face of danger is often played for comic contrast against the attitudes and tendencies of the other characters (especially The Tick himself). Arthur is ethnically Jewish (mentioned in an episode of the 1994 cartoon series), and his family would strongly prefer he leave the superhero lifestyle and return to accounting. Arthur's apartment serves as his and The Tick's superhero headquarters. The 2016 TV series reveals Arthur's full name to be \\"Arthur Everest\\", but it is unknown if this is his full name in any other media. In the 1994 cartoon series, Arthur is voiced by Micky Dolenz in Season One and by Rob Paulsen in Seasons Two and Three. In the 2001 TV series, Arthur is portrayed by David Burke. In the 2016 TV series, Arthur is portrayed by Griffin Newman. ===Main allies of The Tick=== The Tick has different main allies in each of his media appearances: * American Maid (voiced by Kay Lenz) ‚Äì Exclusive to the 1994 series, American Maid is the World's Most Patriotic Domestic and has a love/hate relationship with Die Fledermaus, though there are hints at a past romance. She is possibly the only competent superhero in the animated series apart from The Tick and Arthur, with whom she occasionally teams up. American Maid is a skilled acrobat and can throw her tiara and stilettos with extreme accuracy. Her name is a pun on \\"American made\\". * Batmanuel (portrayed by Nestor Carbonell) ‚Äì Exclusive to the 2001 TV series, Batmanuel is a Latino parody of Batman who teams up with The Tick and Arthur. Although he claims to be a superhero, Batmanuel doesn't have any special powers and is shown to be a cowardly, shady, and lecherous superhero. He has a love/hate relationship with Captain Liberty. * Captain Liberty (portrayed by Liz Vassey) ‚Äì Exclusive to the 2001 TV series, Captain Liberty is a parody of Wonder Woman who teams up with The Tick and Arthur. She is a serious and somewhat sarcastic superhero who works for the CIA. Despite acting tough to other people, she occasionally has relationship issues and woman problems. She has a love/hate relationship with Batmanuel. * Die Fledermaus (voiced by Cam Clarke) ‚Äì Exclusive to the 1994 TV series, Die Fledermaus has a love/hate relationship with American Maid, though there are hints at a past romance. Die Fledermaus is usually the first superhero to run away from danger except on specific occasions. He is also egotistical and obsessed with beautiful women. Die Fledermaus' equipment consists of a roof swinging grappling line gun, utility belt and exoskeleton, and articulated cape. Die Fledermaus means \\"the bat\\" in German, literally \\"the flitter-mouse\\". Another parody of Batman. * Sewer Urchin (voiced by Jess Harnell) ‚Äì A sea urchin-themed superhero who has a luxurious apartment, largely furnished with salvage from the sewers. However, he has relatively few guests. Sewer Urchin has super stench slime secreting spikes on his suit that enable him to stick on any surface. He is also equipped with lemon grenades, butter shooters, bars of soap, and other various apparel to aid him in his underground endeavor. In addition, he has an oxygen tank and mask which allow him to breathe in the thickest of sewer sludge. ==Characters in the comic bookSuperheroes=== Superheroes in The Tick include: {  width=100% ! width=20%  Character ! width=20%  Notable powers ! width=50%  Notes - bgcolor=\\"#dddddd\\"  colspan=3 align=center  Unaffiliated -  The Ant   Has something in his mouth. -  Big Shot  Stores a massive arsenal of weaponry including sub machine guns and grenades inside of a wooden chest he wears on his back.  -  The Cape   A \\"Golden Age\\" superhero that wears an armored cape and is an ally of the Sultan.

Tandra Paparayudu was the Army General of Bobbili during the Battle. ==Events leading to the Battle== On 23 November 1753, a Paravana of Asif ad-Dawlah Mir Ali Salabat Jang, Subedar of Deccan conceded to Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau the parganas of Chicacole, Ellore, Rajahmundry etc. with an annual revenue RS.2, 00,000 for the maintenance of the French troops in the Subah in recognition of the help of these Circars amounted up to 10 lakhs of Rupees per year. de Bussy helped Salabat Jang to be the Subedar of Deccan. The agreement (Treaty of Aurangabad) made between the French and Salabat Jang in Aurangabad bears the signature of Said Loukshur, Minister of Salabat Jang. Actually, He was one of the key sub- ordinates of Dupleix who helped him in expanding French activities in Northern Circars and along the Coromandel Coast. Men in his command also included the famous Hyder Ali of Mysore. In 1756 Marquis de Bussy visited Rajahmundry. Vijayaramaraju had given a warm welcome to Bussy by going in front at Rajahmundry. There were differences between Vizianagaram Maharaja and the ruler of Bobbili, which led to the battle of Bobbili starting on 23 January 1757. The war was fought by Bussy and the Raja of Vizianagaram-Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I (Ruled 1710 ‚Äì Died 1757) (Founder of Vizianagaram. During the battle the Bobbili fort was totally destroyed and many Bobbili soldiers died. There is still a street named after Bussy in Yanam.A History of Telugu Literature p. 36 ==The battle== On January 24, 1757, Bussy with his army and the army of Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I in tow marched towards the Bobbili fort. The army of Gopalakrishna Ranga Rao was no match for the combined armies of Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau and Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I. Gopalakrishna Rayudu was led by his Army General Tandra Paparayudu and his army, who put up a brave fight till the end. The French General knew that it would be impossible to reach Bobbili via Rajam as Paparayudu was camping there and took a different route to reach the fort. Rani Mallamma Devi, wife of Ranga Rao and sister of Paparayudu, sent a message to him on coming to know of the enemy's advance towards the fort. However, the enemy intercepted the courier and the message did not reach Paparayudu. Meanwhile, Ranga Rao and his men after defending the fort for several hours realised that the enemy could not be contained for long. Ranga Rao did not want the women and children in the fort to be at the mercy of the enemy. He ordered them to be sacrificed. Rani Mallamma Devi committed suicide. When the news reached him, Tandra Paparayudu rushed to the demolished fort and saw his sister and the entire family lying on the ground in a pool of blood. Seething with vengeance he took an oath to kill Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I. Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I was camping in a Tent, basking in the glory of the war, which annihilated his enemy. Tandra Paparayudu along with Devulapalli Peddanna and Buddaraju Venkaiah managed to reach the tent in which Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I was sleeping. Paparayudu gained entry through the rear of the tent, while the other two stood guard at the entrance. He woke up Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I shouting \\"Puli, Puli... Bobbili Puli\\" (Tiger, Tiger... The Tiger of Bobbili). Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I tried to divert his attention saying that Velama heroes should not be little their clan as cowards gaining entry through the backdoor. \\"You have wiped out our entire clan through dubious means and have no right to get ethical treatment,\\" replied Paparayudu and stabbed him repeatedly in the chest. Hearing the commotion, the bodyguard of Pusapati Vijayarama Gajapati Raju I tried to enter the tent but was killed by Peddanna, who was guarding the entrance. The entire army was alerted and the Bobbili tiger Paparayudu and the other two killed themselves. ==In popular culture== *Bobbili Yuddham *Tandra Paparayudu ==References== Category:1757 in India Category:History of Andhra Pradesh Category:Battles involving the Indian kingdoms Category:Conflicts in 1757 ","title":"Battle of Bobbili"},{"id":"7448695","text":"Indo-Caribbean music is the musical traditions of the Indo-Caribbean people of the Caribbean music area. Indo-Caribbean music is most common in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Jamaica, and Suriname. Indo-Caribbean traditional music often reflects the Bhojpuri heritage of many Indo-Caribbeans; women's folk songs are especially reflective of the music of Bhojpur. These include folk songs for childbirth (sohar), humorous and light-hearted songs for a bride's family to insult the groom's (gali), funereal songs (nirgun) and matkor. Other women's folk songs are seasonal and are performed at festivals like the phagwah and holi. Instrumentation consists mostly of the dhantal, a metal rod and claper, and the dholak, a two-headed barrel drum. Traditional Hindu bhajans are also common. Modern Indo-Caribbean traditions include the seasonal, responsorial men's form, the chowtal, and a vocal song form called taan-singing, performed by a single male vocalist accompanied by his own harmonium and further accompaniment by the dholak and dhantal. Tassa drumming is also common. Indo- Caribbean contributions to popular music are very important. The most well- known is the Indo-Trinidadian chutney music tradition. Chutney is a form of popular dance music that developed in the mid-to late 20th century. Baithak Gana is a similar popular form originating in Suriname.

It was abolished for the 1983 general election, when it was largely replaced by the new constituency of Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. ==OverviewBoundaries=== The constituency consisted of the historic county of Merionethshire. Merioneth was always an almost entirely rural constituency, rocky and mountainous with grazing the only useful agricultural activity that could be pursued; quarrying was its other main economic mainstay. It was also a strongly Welsh-speaking area (a parliamentary paper in 1904 listed that just 6.2% of the population could only speak English, lower than in any other county in Wales), and by the 19th century was a stronghold of non-conformist religion. ===Establishment=== Like the rest of Wales, Merioneth was given the right to representation by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542, and first returned an MP to the Parliament of 1542; however, unlike all the other Welsh counties, Merioneth had no towns sufficiently important in the 16th century to merit borough status, so the county MP was its only representative. The MP was chosen by the first past the post electoral system ‚Äì when there was a contest at all, which was almost unheard of before the second half of the 19th century. ===Franchise and political influences before the Reform Act=== As in other county constituencies, the franchise until 1832 was defined by the Forty Shilling Freeholder Act, which gave the right to vote to every man who possessed freehold property within the county valued at ¬£2 or more per year for the purposes of land tax; it was not necessary for the freeholder to occupy his land, nor even in later years to be resident in the county at all. Nevertheless, the electorate was small, probably only a few hundred, though the lack of contested elections make it impossible to be sure: at the 1774 election, the only one to go to a poll in the 18th century, exactly 600 votes were cast. By way of comparison, the population at the time of the 1831 census was about 34,500. For more than a century before the Reform Act, Merioneth's representation was almost entirely monopolised by the Vaughan family of Corsygedol ‚Äì they and the Wynns of Wynnstay, who supported them, were the two leading families of the county and the expense of a contested election was presumably seen as futile by any potential opposition candidates. When a magnate from outside the county, The Earl of Powis, did intervene in 1774, his candidate was roundly defeated. Since the Vaughans were not aligned with any of the great aristocratic interests of the rest of Wales, and were generally regarded as maintaining their independence, there was little partisan interest in dislodging them. ===Survival as a constituency with low population=== Although the franchise was somewhat extended under the Great Reform Act, Merioneth's registered electorate at the first post-Reform election was only 580. However, it seems that this considerably under-represented those who were eligible, and more voters could be induced to register by vigorous campaigning. The Liberation Society, a body aiming to maximise the non-conformist vote to achieve disestablishment of the church, was active in Merioneth and a number of other Welsh counties in the 1850s and 1860s, and between the elections of 1859 and 1865 Merioneth's electorate rose by 50%, from 1,091 to 1,527. But there was also a dramatic rise in the electorate between 1835 and 1837 (from 698 to 1,336), which is less easy to explain. Nevertheless, even with these occasional peaks, Merioneth was a small constituency by Welsh ‚Äì let alone English ‚Äì standards. By the time of the 1911 census, the population of Merioneth was 46,849, and in other circumstances it would have been too small to survive as a separate constituency, but the physical geography meant that the inconvenience which would be caused to voters and MPs alike by combining it with a neighbouring county outweighed any arguments for mathematical equality of representation. In 1929, the first election at which all adult men and women had the vote, Merioneth's electorate was under 29,000, and it had fallen even further (to 27,619) by the time of the final (1979) election before the constituency was abolished, even with the extension of the franchise to 18- to 21-year-olds in the 1960s. ===Political character after the 1860s=== The gentry returned unopposed as MPs in Merioneth's deferential days had usually been Conservatives. At the 1850 general election, the sitting member, W.W.E. Wynne of Peniarth, was challenged by the Liberal, David Williams. In an election characterised by allegations of coercion against the nonconformist tenantry, Wynne held the seat by a small majority. In 1865, Wynne stood down, and was succeeded as Conservative candidate by his son, W.R.M. Wynne. Against some expectations, he held the seat with a slightly reduced majority, and this was attributed by Ieuan Gwynedd Jones to 'a sense of terror' that had struck the mainly nonconformist tenant farmers. In 1868, following the extension of the franchise, Wynne withdrew rather than face another contest which he was likely to lose. With the introduction of the secret ballot, Merioneth became one of the safest Liberal seats in Wales ‚Äì mainly the effect of the high number of workers in the slate and limestone quarries round Ffestiniog and Corwen. With the foundation of the Labour Party, the seat became less safe, but the Liberals held it through the first half of the 20th century, losing it to Labour, when Emrys Roberts was defeated by T.W. Jones. The Liberals remained the main challengers until the 1960s. However, with the emergence of Plaid Cymru as a political force, Merioneth was natural territory for the nationalists: they overtook the Liberals for second place behind Labour in 1970, and then Dafydd Elis-Thomas captured the seat at the February 1974 election, one of the first two seats the party had won at a general election. They retained it comfortably in October 1974 and 1979. ===Abolition=== The constituency was finally abolished with effect from the 1983 general election, when the alignment of constituency boundaries with the revised Welsh county boundaries necessitated a change. The Boundary Commission's original proposals would have united Merioneth with English- speaking Conwy on the North Wales coast, and would almost certainly have extinguished Plaid Cymru's chances of holding the seat, but after a public enquiry much more modest changes were adopted. The bulk of the electorate formed the core of the new Meirionnydd Nant Conwy constituency, joined by only around 5,000 voters from outside the old county, while about 3,000 voters in that part of Merionethshire which had been placed in Clwyd rather than Gwynedd moved to the new Clwyd South West constituency. == Members of Parliament  MPs 1542‚Äì1640 === {  - !Parliament!!Member - 1542 Edward Stanley - 1545 Rhys Vaughan - 1547 Lewis ap Owen - 1553 (Mar) Lewis ap Owen - 1553 (Oct) John Salesbury - 1554 (Apr) Lewis ap Owen - 1554 (Nov)Lewis ap Owen - 1555 - 1558 Ellis Price - 1559 (Jan) John Wyn ap Cadwaladr - 1563 (Jan) Ellis Price - 1571 Hugh Owen - 1572 John Lewis Owen - 1584 (Nov) Cadwaladr Price - 1586 Robert Lloyd - 1588 (Nov) Robert Salusbury - 1593 Griffith Nanney - 1597 (Sep) Thomas Myddelton - 1601 (Oct) Robert Lloyd - 1604‚Äì1611 Sir Edward Herbert - 1614 Ellis Lloyd - 1621‚Äì1622 William Salisbury - 1624 Henry Wynn - 1625 Henty Wynn - 1626 Edward Vaughan - 1628‚Äì1629 Richard Vaughan - 1629‚Äì1640 No Parliaments convened } === MPs 1640‚Äì1983 === {  - !colspan=\\"2\\"Year!!Member!!Party - style=\\"background-color: \\"   April 1640  Henry Wynn  - style=\\"background-color: \\"   November 1640  William Price  Royalist - style=\\"background-color: \\"   February 1644 colspan=\\"2\\" Price disabled from sitting ‚Äì seat vacant - style=\\"background- color: \\"   1646  Roger Pope  - style=\\"background-color: \\"   1647  John Jones  - style=\\"background-color: \\"   1653 colspan=\\"2\\" Merioneth was not represented in the Barebones Parliament - style=\\"background-color: \\"   1654  John Vaughan  - style=\\"background-color: \\"   1656  Colonel John Jones Jones, brother-in-law of Oliver Cromwell, was summoned to the new Upper House for the second session of the Parliament, but no replacement as Merioneth's MP was elected  - style=\\"background-color: \\"   January 1659  Lewis Owen  - style=\\"background-color: \\"   May 1659 colspan=\\"2\\" Merioneth was not represented in the restored Rump Although Jones was still alive in 1659, he is not listed as one of those who sat as a member of the restored Rump - style=\\"background-color: \\"   April 1660  Edmund Meyricke  - style=\\"background-color: \\"   1661  Henry Wynn  - style=\\"background-color: \\"   1673  William Price  - style=\\"background- color: \\"   1679  Sir John Wynn  - style=\\"background-color: \\"   1681  Sir Robert Owen  - style=\\"background-color: \\"   1685  Sir John Wynn  - style=\\"background-color: \\"   1695  Hugh Nanney  - style=\\"background- color: \\"   1701  Richard Vaughan  - style=\\"background-color: \\"   1734  William Vaughan  Independent - style=\\"background-color: \\"   1768  John Pugh Pryse  - style=\\"background-color: \\"   1774  Evan Lloyd Vaughan  Tory - style=\\"background-color: \\"   1792  Sir Robert Vaughan  Tory - style=\\"background-color: \\"   1836  Richard Richards  Conservative - style=\\"background-color: \\"   1852  William Watkin Edward Wynne  Conservative - style=\\"background-color: \\"   1865  W.

Brittan built Linwood House at 30 Linwood Avenue in 1857, which stood there until demolition following the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Christchurch lacked an accessible port before the construction of the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel in 1867. This posed a significant problem for the fledgling city.

They collaborated as a husband-and-wife team for thirty-five years, signing their pots Vivika + Otto, regardless of who actually made them. == Otto Heino == One of twelve children born of Finnish immigrants, Lena and August Heino, in East Hampton, Connecticut, United States. His family ran a dairy farm in quiet farm country. Otto Heino's involvement with ceramics began while serving in the U.S. Air Force in England; during a military leave, he spent several days watching Bernard Leach throw pots. Following his return to the US, he used his GI Bill funding in 1949 to study ceramics at the League of New Hampshire Arts and Crafts, in Concord, New Hampshire. There he met Vivika, his teacher, whom he was married to in 1950. ===Military service=== During World War II, Otto Heino served five years of active duty in the USAAF where he briefly worked on engines at a Rolls-Royce factory in England. He was assigned to the 357th Fighter Group, the \\"Yoxford Boys\\", based in Leiston, Suffolk. Due to his knowledge of Rolls-Royce engines, T/Sgt Otto Heino served as a crew chief, maintaining the group's P-51 Mustang fighters.

In the mid 1930s, after getting a teaching degree at the Rochester Normal School, she spent two years with the Works Progress Administration theatre project, and headed the National Youth Administration in San Francisco. Discovering clay at this time, she studied at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute), and with Glen Lukens at the University of Southern California. Lukens, a highly respected ceramist renowned for his glazes, gave her the opportunity to explore colored clays, develop new glazes, and experiment with raw materials. (In later years, she and Otto were to devote a day a week to measuring, mixing, and testing new glazes.) Her pots were exhibited at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition, in San Francisco. Vivien Place started using the name Vivika while studying at the Swedish Applied Arts, in San Francisco, where teacher Margaret Gravandar thought everyone should have a Swedish name. (Even her mother started calling her that.) In 1941, Vivika received an M.F.A. from New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University, Alfred, New York. She was the second M.F.A. graduate from the ceramics program there (following Daniel Rhodes in 1940). == Otto + Vivika == Otto and Vivika moved to California in 1952, where Vivika replaced Glen Lukens, head of ceramics department of the University of Southern California, during his sabbatical; she remained there for three years. Otto also taught at the university during this time. Also in 1952, she became a technical advisor for Twentieth Century Fox Studios, and she and Otto made 751 pots for the movie The Egyptian in 1953. In 1955, as they prepared to return home to Hopkinton, New Hampshire, she was invited to reorganize the ceramics department at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles, and remained there for eight years. During that time, they remodelled a store on Hoover Street into a studio and began selling their work directly to the public, with success. Otto worked full-time as a potter while Vivika taught; during the summer, they switched roles, Otto teaching and Vivika producing pottery. Vivika helped organise and became a board member of the Southern California Designer Craftsmen, and later a trustee for the southwestern region of the American Craft Council. She travelled to nearby states to help organize craft groups, something she had experience with from her days at the League of New Hampshire Arts and Crafts. After an eleven-year stay in California (originally expected to last two), Vivika accepted in 1963 an offer to teach at the Rhode Island School of Design, in Providence, Rhode Island. In 1965, the Heinos reopened their home and studio in Hopkinton, New Hampshire. Teaching was a very important part of Vivika's life. Although he also enjoyed teaching, Otto preferred studio production. Over the years, Vivika accepted a number of short-term teaching assignments, punctuated by periods of studio work with Otto. > What you give away you have forever; what you keep to yourself, you lose.\\" > (Vivika Heino) They later returned to California, crossing the country in three moving vans, carrying 29 tons of materials. They purchased a house in Ojai, a small community in the mountains northwest of Los Angeles, built by Beatrice Wood, a friend since 1952. Their pottery studio, The Pottery, produced functional and decorative vessels, as well as architectural commissions. The Heinos supported themselves as potters throughout their career. Clean lines and distinctive glazes mark their work; avoiding ceramic trends, they focused on traditional and utilitarian pottery. Glazes, however, are Heino's greatest legacy.

Max has written several books including The Revival and Tales from Comanche County. ==Biography== right Max Yoho was born in Colony, Kansas in 1934. In 1944 Max moved with his family to Atchison, Kansas and in 1949 to Topeka, Kansas. He graduated from Topeka High School in 1953. Following graduation, he enrolled at Washburn University where his writing talents were identified. He wrote for The Review, a student newspaper. Max was married to his high school sweetheart, Rosemary Carter, in 1953 and they had three sons: Alex, Stuart and Nicholas. Max worked as a machinist for 38 years, including 31.5 years at the Goodyear Tire & Rubber plant in Topeka. Yoho began to focus on writing after he became a widower in 1988. Focusing on poetry, essays and short-short stories, much of Yoho's early work was published in Inscape, the literary journal produced by Washburn University in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He retired as a machinist in April, 1992, and focused seriously on his writing career. Max died in April, 2017, after suffering from kidney failure. He is survived by his second wife, Carol, and three sons: Alex (Sherry) Yoho, Stuart (Anna) Yoho, and Nick Yoho. Max's first wife, Rosemary, had died in 1988.

Magdalena Island and the Marta Island, situated in the middle of the Strait of Magellan, is the main part of this natural monument. The largest penguin colonies of south Chile are on this island, including an estimated 60,000 breeding pairs of the Magellanic penguin. The islands are currently uninhabited by humans, but are a popular tourist destination. Each summer, thousands of tourists travel to the monument to see the penguins and other wildlife. At 85 hectares, Magdalena Island is the larger of the two islands, and receives most of the tourist traffic, while Marta is made up of only 12 hectares of surface area, and is not often included in tours. CONAF (National Forest Corporation of Chile) manages the monument in an attempt to sustain both the tourism and the Magellanic penguins, for which the island has become a critical habitat. Los Pinguinos Natural Monument, in the Middle of the map ==History== Prior to the 16th century, Magdalena and Marta Islands were inhabited by three pre-Hispanic cultures: the Selknam, the Yaghan, and the Kawesqar.Sanfuentes, Olaya and Claudio Almarza. 2013. \\"Monumentos Naturales de Chile\\". Patrimonio Cultural de Chile. http://www.patrimonio.cl/wp- content/uploads/2013/08/Monumentosnaturales.pdf These people had very little effect on the islands as they had a small population and also spent much time fishing at sea, rather than being on the island. The Selknam were forced to leave after Spanish colonialists brought sheep to the region, which eliminated the habitat of the guanaco, an animal similar to an alpaca, that they hunted. The Yaghan and Kawesqar also eventually abandoned the area due to colonial pressure. Though people no longer live on the islands, the human impacts are likely much greater than where there were inhabitants because thousands of people visit the islands each year. While many names for the islands have been used during early exploration by Spanish ships and pirates, their current names, Magdalena and Marta were given by a 16th-century Spanish explorer, Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa.http://www.biografiadechile.cl/detalle.php?IdContenido=674&IdCategoria;=29&IdArea;=212&status;=S&TituloPagina;=Historia%20de%20Chile&pos;=9 Little history of the island from the time of Spanish colonialism to the present day has been recorded. ==Description == The Ping√ºinos monument was founded in 1966 in an effort to protect the Magellanic penguin from the threat of fishing. Because the penguins feed on the same species that the fishing industry targets, high levels of fishing deplete the penguins‚Äô food source, causing a decline in their population.http://www.seabirds.org/chile.htm In 1982, the monument was named a protected area. By having a 30-kilometer no- fishing zone around the island, and by preserving the island as a penguin- breeding site, the penguin population has recovered. Magellanic penguins have continued to thrive on the island: from 2000 to 2007, the population increased by 6%, and some penguins have migrated to a nearby island because Magdalena is running out of space.Bingham, Mike and Thora M. Herrmann. 2008. Magellanic Penguin (spheniscidae) monitoring results for Magdalena Island (Chile) 2000‚Äì2008. Anales del Instituto de la Patagonia 36(2):19-32. http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-686X2008000200003&script;=sci_arttext ===Climate=== The climate can be described as cold and rainy, with an average temperature of 46 F. There are not large seasonal changes other than the temperature shifts between summer and winter. During the winter, the temperature may drop below zero, and during the summer, it may reach 64 F.http://www.visitchile.com/en/penguin-natural-monument/ Average annual rainfall is 17 inches. High winds are reported by many who visit the monument. Magellanic penguins on Magdalena Island ===Flora=== Very few species of flora are found on the islands, which may be due to the cold, windy climate, as well as the rocky substrate that composes the island. One species of short grass is found across Magdalena island. The grass particularly thrives in areas with reduced animal populations.http://www.conaf.cl/parques/monumento-natural-los- pinguinos/ The ocean surrounding Magdalena Island supports a large kelp population ===Fauna=== The most notable fauna found at the monument is the Magellanic penguin, for which the site was named. Over 60,000 pairs inhabit the island, and it is these penguins that attract tourists to the site. Other important fauna include the imperial shag, sea lions and south American fur seals, who are known to rest on the islands, and two species of seagull: the dolphin gull and the common gull. Some of the rocky shoreline supports a mussel population. ===Threats to the penguin population=== The Magellanic penguin is not an endangered species, but it is close to becoming a threatened species due to the habitat loss and resource scarcity in many regions of South America. The penguins have much higher birth rates and chick survival rates on Magdalena Island than at other nesting sites, which have been disturbed by human activity. Because the penguins face threats at other locations, the preservation of the natural monument has become much more important. The islands are an ideal resource for the penguins because of the low predator abundance, high food abundance, and the isolation of the islands from the developed world, especially when the islands are closed to tourists Though tourism is well managed and does not pose a significant threat to the Magellanic penguins, there are several other potential problems that may arise for the penguins on Isla Magdalena. A minor concern is that many parts of the shoreline are experiencing erosion. The erosion is not occurring fast enough to require urgent attention, but over a longer timescale, it may decrease the surface area of the island and therefore the number of penguins that are able to nest there. Another threat was discovered when the current monitoring program noticed a decline in penguin population during the summer of 2002‚Äì03. The monitoring report hypothesizes that the decline was due to a drought in the previous summer. The drought caused much of the grass covering the island to die, leaving the island susceptible to dust storms, which can destroy the penguin‚Äôs nests. Because drought has such a large impact on the penguins, climate change, which is expected to cause a decrease in annual rainfall, may pose a serious threat to the survival of the penguins. Additionally, many boats transporting oil pass through the Strait of Magellan, which poses the risk of an oil spill. An oil spill has the potential to have a serious negative effect on the penguins. Because this sort of catastrophe is impossible to predict, it represents the most drastic effect that would require huge efforts to restore the penguin population, which, depending on the size of the spill, may not be possible. Even if there is no spill, the oil trade presents a risk. Once the oil tanks have been emptied, they are refilled with water. Then, when the water is released, oily substances can be discharged from the boat. These substances make the penguin feathers worse at insulating, so the penguins leave the water, and then are unable to hunt for food and thus starve to death. If ingested, the oil can hurt the penguin‚Äôs digestion and immune systems.Roach, John. 2005. \\"Struggle to save the penguins; The long-term survival of Magellanic penguin is threatened by the depletion of commercial fish and the loss of birds soaked in oil dumped from freighters. But biologists and conservationists aren't giving up.\\" National Geographic There is not much that can be done to prevent these risks, other than cutting off the route through the Strait of Magellan, which may create too many complications for the oil industry for such a strategy to even be considered. ==Natural Monument== Los Pinguinos Natural monuments are one of three types of protected areas of Chile. The purpose of Chile‚Äôs natural monuments is to protect some special feature of the natural environment, which may be the flora, fauna, or even the culture or history of the location. Sites are chosen as monuments because they represent an important part of Chilean identity and play a role in the development of the relationship between humans and the environment. The Los pinguinos monument natural was created in 1966 to preserve the site as a breeding area for the penguins, as well as a habitat for other migratory birds. The monument also represents the cultural heritage of Chile, as it was inhabited by indigenous groups hundreds of years ago. Therefore, the conservation of the islands does not imply that humans must be kept out, rather that a sustainable relationship between the humans and the wildlife and landscape of the island must be maintained. Designating the site as a natural monument approaches the dual goals of maintaining the penguin population and celebrating the natural and cultural treasures of the country. ==Ecotourism== Monumento nacional los pinguinos is open from October through March. During the remainder of the year, the penguins are preparing for and engaging in breeding activity. During this time, humans are prohibited from the monument to prevent them from interfering. Additionally, tourism is also closed while the penguins are absent from the island during the winter, mostly because there is then little to see for the tourists and harsher weather. For Chilean citizens, the entry fee is 3,000 Chilean pesos (CLP), and for foreigners the fee is 5,000 CLP. Visitors must travel to the islands from Punta Arenas by ferry with a tourist company, which comes at an additional cost. There is a small museum on the island where tourists can learn about the history of the monument, as well as biological facts about the penguins. In addition to the attraction of the penguins, the island also contains a lighthouse, Faro Isla Magdalena, which was opened in 1901. Visitors can climb up the spiral staircase to the top, which is 14 meters high, to gain a view of the island and the surrounding ocean.http://www.duwal.com/en/travelguide/south-america/chile/punta- arenas/things-to-do-list/64 While tourism is believed to be growing, there are no complete records of how many people visit the island, which makes assessing the impact of the tourist industry difficult.Fowler, Gene. 1999. Behavioral and hormonal responses of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) to tourism and nest site visitation. Biological Conservation 90:143-149. Ecotourism represents a type of travel in which tourists aim to be responsible both in terms of conservation and of respect for local communities, and is often celebrated as a way to bring economic benefits into a region that has few other opportunities.Charnley, Susan. 2005. From Nature Tourism to Ecotourism? Human Organization 64(1):75-88. Ideally, ecotourists have a low impact on the site they are visiting and in some way, at least economically, bring benefits to the region.Skewgar, Elizabeth et al. 2009. ‚ÄúMarine Reserve in Chile would benefit penguins and ecotourism.‚Äù Ocean and Coastal Management 52:487-491. In reality, ecotourists are not always perfect travellers, and may actually create some problems for the tourist site.West, Paige, & James G. Carrier. 2004. Ecotourism and Authenticity: Getting Away from it All? Current Anthropology 45(4):483-498. Similarly, they may have conflicting expectations which make the management of the tourist site difficult. Ecotourists expect an authentic site, where they can observe the animals and environment as it occurs naturally, yet they are also interested in getting as close to the wildlife, in this case penguins, as possible. These desires are contradictory because the penguins that live on the side of the island without tourists behave much differently than the penguins that interact with tourists on a daily basis. The penguins on the tourist side have a very low fear of humans in comparison with those who do not often interact with humans, and will be less likely to flee when approached by a human. While this is desirable for the tourists, it is unclear whether this change in behavior ruins something about the authenticity of the experience. Some penguins benefit from the tourism; scientists hypothesize that predators avoid penguins that nest by humans, which showed us the results of human impacts having consequences that are hard to predict. ===Concerns=== There are many concerns about how tourism may threaten the conservation efforts on the island, specifically in terms of penguin populations. For example, near Chiloe on the west coast of Chile, there are high levels of fishing both to sustain the tourist population and from tourists who themselves wish to participate in fishing. Penguins are the main attraction for tourists and sustain the economy of the region, yet they are threatened by a decrease in food sources because of the high fishing levels. Another concern is that penguin behavior may change in the presence of humans, which may impact their viability and change the natural aspect of the environment.Walker, Brian, et al. 2005. ‚ÄúHabituation of Adult Magellanic Penguins to Habitat Visitation as Expressed through Behavior and Corticosterone Secretion‚Äù. Conservation Biology 20(1):146-154. Penguins are shown to produce stress-related hormones when encountering humans, though penguins who live at tourist sites produce fewer hormones than those who do not, suggesting that they have adapted and become more comfortable in the presence of humans. Humbert penguins, for example, have been observed to have lower birth rates in the present of high tourism. Magellanic penguins are believed to be able to better tolerate humans than other penguin species that exhibit stress responses when even one person is spotted at a distance.Jaff, Eric. 2006. ‚ÄúGood Gone Wild: sometimes, ecotourism hurts what it sets out to help.‚Äù Science News 170(14):218-220. While the Magellanic penguins may not be affected to the same degree it is still important to minimize human effects on them. Additionally, although Magellanic penguins may be able to adapt to the presence of humans, this does not necessarily occur quickly. Therefore, to give the penguins a chance to grow comfortable, it is important that some parts of the island are prevented from human intrusion. Having part of the area secluded allows penguins to become adapted at a distance before being comfortable enough to build nests in the human-visited areas. ===Management strategies=== Yearly surveys of the penguin population on Magdalena Island have shown that their population is thriving and they are not experiencing negative impacts due to tourism. The monitoring program that has been going on since 1999 has been affective in providing an assessment of the penguin population so that management practices that keep the population at sustainable levels can be employed. There are several management practices that have made the low level of impact possible. First, it is important that tourists remain on the marked path and do not cross the rope boundaries on either side. The path is 850 meters long and travels through much of the island, while still leaving large regions inaccessible to humans. By keeping tourists in limited areas, the effects of large numbers of tourists are minimized, and penguins maintain regions where they can avoid the stress caused by human presence. Additionally, the prohibition of fishing within 30 kilometers of the islands eliminates fishing as a tourist attraction. The lack of fishing as an option minimizes the impact of tourists on the environment and allows for sustainable tourism without threatening the food source of the penguins. Another factor that improves the viability of tourism at the monument is the education that is provided to tourists as they travel to Magdalena Island. Reaching the island requires an hour-long ferry ride, in which most tour companies show an informational video and discuss what tourists can expect on their visit to the island and how they should behave. This information may play a critical role in limiting human impacts and potential destruction from tourists on the island. Similarly, the ferry system provides a large number of jobs for local people, including people to drive the boat, tour guides to speak during the journey, and ship attendants to sell food and direct tourists while on the boat. The ferry system therefore gives the Los Ping√ºinos national monument an advantage over other sites that may struggle to find ways to increase the economic gains without some loss of environmental resources. ==See also== * Magellanic penguin * Magdalena Island * Protected areas of Chile ==References *CONAF: monumento natural los pinguinos Category:Natural monuments of Chile Category:Protected areas of Magallanes Region Category:Strait of Magellan ","title":"Los Ping√ºinos Natural Monument"},{"id":"7449011","text":"Kern Valley State Prison (KVSP) is a male-only state prison in Delano, California.

The vibration is often generated by an electric motor with an unbalanced mass on its driveshaft. There are many different types of vibrator. Typically, they are components of larger products such as smartphones, pagers, vibrating sex toys, or video game controllers with a \\"rumble\\" feature. ==Vibrators as components== When smartphones and pagers vibrate, the vibrating alert is produced by a small component that is built into the phone or pager. Many older, non- electronic buzzers and doorbells contain a component that vibrates for the purpose of producing a sound. Tattoo machines and some types of electric engraving tools contain a mechanism that vibrates a needle or cutting tool. ==Industrial vibrators== alt=A handheld concrete vibrator consolidates fresh concrete in a wooden form for a concrete beam. Handheld concrete vibrator removing air bubbles from still liquid concrete. Vibrators are used in many different industrial applications both as components and as individual pieces of equipment. Bowl feeders, vibratory feeders and vibrating hoppers are used extensively in the food, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries to move and position bulk material or small component parts. The application of vibration working with the force of gravity can often move materials through a process more effectively than other methods. Vibration is often used to position small components so that they can be gripped mechanically by automated equipment as required for assembly etc. Vibrating screens are used to separate bulk materials in a mixture of different sized particles. For example, sand, gravel, river rock and crushed rock, and other aggregates are often separated by size using vibrating screens. Vibrating compactors are used for soil compaction especially in foundations for roads, railways, and buildings. Concrete vibrators consolidate freshly poured concrete so that trapped air and excess water are released and the concrete settles firmly in place in the formwork. Improper consolidation of concrete can cause product defects, compromise the concrete strength, and produce surface blemishes such as bug holes and honeycombing. An internal concrete vibrator is a steel cylinder about the size of the handle of a baseball bat, with a hose or electrical cord attached to one end. The vibrator head is immersed in the wet concrete. External concrete vibrators attach, via a bracket or clamp system, to the concrete forms. There are a wide variety of external concrete vibrators available and some vibrator manufacturers have bracket or clamp systems designed to fit the major brands of concrete forms. External concrete vibrators are available in hydraulic, pneumatic or electric power. Vibrating tables or shake tables are sometimes used to test products to determine or demonstrate their ability to withstand vibration. Testing of this type is commonly done in the automotive, aerospace, and defense industries. These machines are capable of producing three different types of vibration profile sine sweep, random vibration, and synthesized shock. In all three of these applications, the part under test will typically be instrumented with one or more accelerometers to measure component response to the vibration input. A sine sweep vibration profile typically starts vibrating at low frequency and increases in frequency at a set rate (measured in hertz). The vibratory amplitude as measured in gs may increase or decrease as well. A sine sweep will find resonant frequencies in the part. A random vibration profile will excite different frequencies along a spectrum at different times. Significant calculation goes into making sure that all frequencies get excited to within an acceptable tolerance band. A random vibration test suite may range anywhere from 30 seconds up to several hours. It is intended to synthesize the effect of, for example, a car driving over rough terrain or a rocket taking off. A synthesized shock pulse is a short duration high level vibration calculated as a sum of many half-sine waves covering a range of frequencies. It is intended to simulate the effects of an impact or explosion. A shock pulse test typically lasts less than a second. Vibrating tables can also be used in the packaging process in material handling industries to shake or settle a container so it can hold more product. ==References== Category:Electric motors Category:Mechanical vibrations ","title":"Vibrator (mechanical)"},{"id":"7449066","text":"The Unity Alliance ( - AU) was a Nicaraguan electoral alliance of three center left and right parties in the Nicaraguan 1996 elections.

Tarabotti wrote texts and corresponded with cultural and political figures for most of her adult life, centering on the issues of forced enclosure, and what she saw as other symptoms and systems of patriarchy and misogyny in her works and discussions.Westwater, Cloistered, 284.Panizza, 1. Tarabotti wrote at least seven works, though only five were published during her lifetime.Ray, Biography.Westwater, Cloistered, 284-5. Because of the politics of Tarabotti‚Äôs works, many scholars consider her ‚Äúa protofeminist writer as well as an early political theorist.‚Äù Ray, Biography. == Early life and enclosure == Sant'Anna Convent in Venice Sister Arcangela Tarabotti was born Elena Cassandra Tarabotti in Castello, Venice.Ray, Biography. Her parents were Stefano Tarabotti and Maria Cadena.Ray, Biography. One of her siblings was the painter Caterina Tarabotti. Tarabotti was one of eleven children and the eldest of seven daughters.Ray, Biography. Tarabotti, like her father, had physical disabilities, which made her feel physically weak and may have contributed to her father‚Äôs conclusion that she was unfit for marriage.Panizza, 2. According to her, at the age of 11 (in 1617), Tarabotti was sent as a boarder to the Benedictine convent of Sant‚ÄôAnna, but the convent papers state her presence only from 1617 onwards \\"Panizza, 3.Ray, Biography. Such monachization‚Äîespecially of daughters deemed ‚Äúunmarriageable‚Äù‚Äîwas common in Early Modern Europe; this practice, especially when forced or coerced, formed the thematic center of her critical works.Westwater, Friendship, 79. The Chiesa di Sant'Anna still stands in the Castello district of Venice, although the inside of the building is currently inaccessible, boarded up and padlocked. In 1620, Tarabotti took her first vows and, in 1623, she took her final vows rendering her monastic status permanent.Panizza, 3. At least during her earlier years in the cloister, Tarabotti was said to have been rebellious and outspoken; Tarabotti tells she wore the religious habit in a worldly way or cut her hair until directly ordered to do so by Catholic Cardinal and Patriarch of Venice, Federico Baldissera Bartolomeo Corner or Cornaro.Panizza, 3, 6. Her beliefs, however, remained unchanged; Tarabotti wrote in her autobiography, explaining that \\"He made me amend my vanities. I cut off my hair, but I did not uproot my emotions. I reformed my life, but my thoughts flourish rampantly, and just like my shorn hair, grow all the more.\\"quoted in Panizza, 6, from Tarabotti's Paradiso. Indeed, though Tarabotti remained less outwardly rebellious after this time, she wrote that, by living as a nun, she was \\"living a lie.\\"Panizza, 6. Nuns at this time lived under strict enclosure and separately from lay society, and were prohibited by Canon Law from interacting with people outside of the cloister. Enclosed as she was, Tarabotti managed to educate herself, reading and writing a great deal of prohibited books during her years in the convent; not only that, Tarabotti also managed to circulate her works among peers through correspondence, and appears to have had many visits from outsiders‚Äîall of which contact and correspondence were in direct disobedience of Church officials.Panizza, 7, 12‚Äì13. During her time in the cloister, Tarabotti appears to have educated herself and created an impressive network of correspondents, including various writers, scientists, and political figures.Panizza, 12‚Äì13.Westwater, Friendship, 67. Tarabotti used this network to engage in critical political and literary discourse with cultural and political figures, and to help in the editing and publishing of five texts during her lifetime (and, Paternal Tyranny, her most prized work, two years after her death).Ray, Biography.Panizza, 7, 12‚Äì13.Westwater, Cloister, 284-5. Though sometimes cloistered women had opportunities to educate themselves and sometimes had access to books and writing materials, Tarabotti's level of education seemed unique even among this group of women‚Äîindeed, some historians have remarked that despite her handwriting was not \\"well above average.\\", her culture and skills were.Medioli, 55. Most unusual though, may have been Tarabotti's radical politics and connections to influential literary and political communities. Her works incorporate a profound critique of the Catholic Church's increasing limitation treatment of its female agents in the 17th century. She particularly highlights the role of education and the disparities between male and female opportunities for schooling. Her argumentation remains thoroughly grounded in biblical evidence, highlighting the prominence of female disciples in Jesus Christ's following given the patriarchal context of first-century Judaism, and consequently arguing that women should have a more significant role in the contemporary church and world. == Correspondence and peers == Some historians argue that Tarabotti's published Letters reveal a \\"wide-ranging and powerful set of correspondents that included leading cultural and political figures from throughout Northern Italy and into France.\\"Westwater, Friendship, 67. Indeed, Tarabotti corresponded with a range of people, from subversive scientists to well known writers. Tarabotti was the only woman writer in Venice ever documented to have a relationship and correspondences with‚Äîas well as enjoy the patronage of‚ÄîGiovanni Francesco Loredan, founder of the Incogniti literary society,Panizza, 12-3 and boasts in her Letters of correspondence with many other members of the Venetian elite. Tarabotti also corresponded and exchanged her work with Francesco Pona, a subversive author of various erotic novels and deliberately anticlerical works; with father Angelico Aprosio, an elite scholar from Ventimiglia; with a \\"fugitive Carthusian monk\\" whose works also criticized forced monachization and mistreatment of women in the cloister; with Giovanni Francesco Busenello, a successful Italian lawyer, a prolific poet, and an acclaimed librettist; and with Count Pier Paolo Bissari of Vicenza, another writer whose works range from prose, to poetry, to libretti. Panizza, 12‚Äì13. Possibly after Tarabotti's Letters was published, she began a correspondence with Isma√´l Bullialdus, a prominent astronomer and mathematician, whom she had met when he was in Venice visiting the French Ambassador and his wife in 1645-1646. Her letters situate Tarabotti in a scholarly community of writers, scientists, and other important political and cultural figures, wherein her presence as a woman was unique and hard won. Her published correspondence also made clear her unyielding resolve to circulate her works and spread her political messages.Medioli, 83‚Äì84. Indeed, especially in the case of Paternal Tyranny‚Äîthe text that many historians say was her most prized and maybe most politically subversive work‚ÄîLetters reveals an ongoing, highly strategic, and often disappointing if impressive saga of requests for patronage and editorial help.Westwater, Friendship, 68. == Writing and politics == Tarabotti's open criticisms of the coerced monachization of women, misogyny, and other facets of patriarchal systems made her a unique political writer. Not only was the content of Tarabotti's written work unique, but so too was the style of her writing‚ÄîTarabotti's mode of writing melded autobiography, fictional account, literary critique, political manifesto, invective, and hermeneutics, to create powerful works that forwarded a provocative protofeminist politics.Panizza, 1.Medioli, 83.Westwater, Cloistered, 287. Paternal Tyranny, widely considered Tarabotti's most prized work, lays bare her radical politics. Lynn Lara Westwater, a historian who has researched and written much on Tarabotti‚Äôs life and works calls Paternal Tyranny \\"scathing and deeply subversive.\\"Westwater, Friendship, 68. Paternal Tyranny was indeed subversive, and was received as such: in 1654, the year it was published, the Congregation of the Index attempted to get it placed on the Index of Prohibited Books ‚Äîand, thus, effectively banned. Paternal Tyranny was eventually placed on the Index in 1661.Westwater, Friendship, 70. Paternal Tyranny is organized into three sections or \\"books\\", the unifying theme of which is the structures of power‚Äîfrom state and governmental hierarchies, to hierarchies within the church, to gender hierarchies‚Äîthat ensure the subjugation of women, especially through forcing women into the cloister and denying them sufficient education.Panizza, 1, 16. In Paternal Tyranny, Tarabotti critiques misogynistic narratives in popular European writings, supporting her pro-women messages with texts such as the Bible, Dante‚Äôs Divine Comedy, and the works of other Venetian women writers like Lucrezia Marinella .Panizza, 16. All in all, the text combats what its title asserts: male tyranny. == Works == The following is a list of Tarabotti‚Äôs published works (in chronological date of publication). *Paradiso monacale or The Monastic Paradise (published 1643). *Antisatira or Antisatire (pub. 1644), an anonymous response to Francesco Buoninsegni‚Äôs *Contro ‚Äòl lusso donnesco satira menippea (1638). *Lettere familiari e di complimento or Letters (pub. 1650). *Le Lagrime D'Arcangela Tarabotti or Arcangela Tarabotti's Tears (pub. 1650). *Che le donne siano della specie degli uomini Difesa delle donne or That Women are of the Human Race.

The one on the right has been stripped of the aluminum cap so the inner components can be seen. chopper amplifier in polygraph input amplifier. A vibrator is an electromechanical device that takes a DC electrical supply and converts it into pulses that can be fed into a transformer. It is similar in purpose (although greatly different in operation) to the solid-state power inverter. Before the development of switch-mode power supplies and the introduction of semiconductor devices operating off low voltage, there was a requirement to generate voltages of about 50 to 250 V DC from a vehicle's battery. A vibrator was used to provide pulsating DC which could be converted to a higher voltage with a transformer, rectified, and filtered to create higher-voltage DC. It is essentially a relay using normally closed contacts to supply power to the relay coil, thus immediately breaking the connection, only to be reconnected very quickly through the normally closed contacts. It happens so rapidly it vibrates, and sounds like a buzzer. This same rapidly pulsing contact applies the rising and falling DC voltage to the transformer which can step it up to a higher voltage. The primary use for this type of circuit was to operate vacuum tube radios in vehicles, but it also saw use with other mobile electronic devices with a 6 or 12 V accumulator, especially in places with no mains electricity supply such as farms. These vibrator power supplies became popular in the 1940s, replacing more bulky motor-generator systems for the generation of AC voltages for such applications. Vacuum tubes require plate voltages ranging from about 45 volts to 250 volts in electronic devices such as radios. For portable radios, hearing aids and similar equipment, B batteries were manufactured with various voltage ratings. In order to provide the necessary voltage for a radio from the typical 6 or 12 volt DC supply available in a car or from a farm lighting battery, it was necessary to convert the steady DC supply to a pulsating DC and use a transformer to increase the voltage. Vibrators often experienced mechanical malfunctions, being constantly in motion, such as the springs losing tension, and the contact points wearing down. As tubes began to be replaced by transistor based electrical systems, the need to generate such high voltages began to diminish. Mechanical vibrators fell out of production near the end of the 20th century, but solid- state electronic vibrators are still manufactured to be backwards compatible with older units. == Use == Schematic diagram of a typical circuit to convert low voltage DC to high voltage DC The vibrator was a device with switch contacts mounted at the ends of flexible metal strips. In operation, these strips are vibrated by an electromagnet, causing the contacts to open and close rapidly. The contacts interrupt the 6 or 12V direct current from the battery to form a stream of pulses which change back and forth from 0 volts to the battery voltage, effectively generating a square wave. Unlike a steady direct current, when such a pulsating current is applied to the primary winding of a transformer it will induce an alternating current in the secondary winding, at a pre-determined voltage based on the turn ratio of the windings. This current can then be rectified by a thermionic diode or copper- oxide or selenium rectifier, or by an additional set of mechanical contacts (in which case the vibrator acts as a type of synchronous rectifier). The rectified output is then filtered, ultimately producing a DC voltage typically much higher than the battery voltage, with some losses dissipated as heat. This arrangement is essentially an electromechanical inverter circuit. The vibrator's primary contacts alternately make and break current supply to the transformer primary. As it is impossible for the vibrator's contacts to change over instantaneously, the collapsing magnetic field in the core will induce a high voltage in the windings, and will cause sparking at the vibrator's contacts. This would erode the contacts very quickly, so a snubber capacitor with a high voltage rating (C8 in the diagram) is added across the transformer secondary to damp out the unwanted high-voltage \\"spikes\\". Since vibrators wore out over time, they were usually encased in a steel or aluminum \\"tin can\\" enclosure with a multi-pin plug at the bottom (similar to the contact pins on vacuum tubes), so they could be quickly unplugged and replaced without using tools. Vibrators generate a certain amount of audible noise (a constant buzzing sound) while in operation, which could potentially be heard by passengers in the car while the radio was on. To help contain this sound within the vibrator's enclosure, the inside surface of the can was often lined with a thick sound-deadening material, such as foam rubber. Since vibrators were typically plugged into sockets mounted directly on the radio chassis, the vibration could potentially be mechanically coupled to the chassis, causing it to act as a sounding-board for the noise. To prevent this, the sound-deadening lining inside the can was sometimes made thick enough to support the vibrator's components by friction alone. The components were then connected to the plug pins by flexible wires, to further isolate the vibration from the plug. == See also == * Boost converter * Chopper * Mechanical rectifier * Multivibrator * Reed relay * Switched-mode power supply ==References== Category:Electric power conversion Category:Electrical components ","title":"Vibrator (electronic)"},{"id":"7449190","text":"Warren Billingsley Hitchcock (18 December 1919 - 16 March 1984) was an Australian field biologist and ornithologist.

California, 538 U.S. 11 (2003), is one of two cases upholding a sentence imposed under California's three strikes law against a challenge that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment.. As in its prior decision in Harmelin v. Michigan,. the United States Supreme Court could not agree on the precise reasoning to uphold the sentence. But, with the decision in Ewing and the companion case Lockyer v. Andrade, the Court effectively foreclosed criminal defendants from arguing that their non-capital sentences were disproportional to the crime they had committed. Ewing was represented in the Court by Quin Denvir. The Attorney General of California argued for the State of California. Michael Chertoff argued on behalf of the United States as amicus curiae. ==Facts== Viewed separately from his criminal history, the crime Gary Ewing committed in this case is relatively benign. In 2000 he stole three golf clubs worth $399 each from the pro shop of the El Segundo Golf Course in El Segundo, California. He slipped them down the leg of his pants, and a shop employee called the police when he noticed Ewing limping out of the pro shop.Ewing, 538 U.S. at 17-18. Ewing was charged with and convicted of felony grand theft of personal property.Ewing, 538 U.S. at 19. Under California law, felony grand theft is a \\"wobbler,\\" meaning that both the prosecutor and the trial judge have discretion to reduce classification of the seriousness of the crime to a misdemeanor.Ewing, 538 U.S. at 17. Although Ewing asked the trial court to exercise its discretion in this way, thus making him ineligible for sentencing under the three strikes law, the trial judge declined to do so, in part based on Ewing's extensive criminal history:Ewing, 538 U.S. at 19-20. *Ewing committed his first crime in 1984 when he was 22 years old. He pleaded guilty to theft, and received a six-month suspended sentence. *In 1988 Ewing was convicted of felony grand theft auto and sentenced to a year in jail and three years' probation. *In 1990, Ewing was convicted of petty theft and sentenced to 60 days in jail and three years' probation. *In 1992, Ewing was convicted of battery and sentenced to 30 days in jail. *Sometime in the first nine months of 1993, Ewing was convicted of burglary, possession of drug paraphernalia, appropriating lost property, unlawful possession of a firearm, and trespassing. *In October and November 1993, Ewing committed his most serious crimes to date--a string of burglaries and robbery at apartment complexes in Long Beach, California, where he made off with money, electronics, and credit cards. *In December 1993 Ewing was arrested on the premises of another Long Beach apartment complex. Police found on his person a knife used in the prior robbery, along with a glass cocaine pipe. He was convicted of one count of first-degree robbery and three counts of residential burglary, and sentenced to nine years in prison. Ewing was paroled in 1999, ten months before he stole the golf clubs from the pro shop in El Segundo.Ewing, 538 U.S. at 18-19. At sentencing on the golf club theft, the judge classified the 1993 burglaries and robbery as \\"two strikes\\" and imposed the 25-to-life sentence under California's three strikes law.Ewing, 538 U.S. at 20. Ewing appealed his conviction to the California Court of Appeal, which rejected his challenge that the 25-year sentence was grossly disproportional to the crime of stealing $1200 worth of goods in a non-violent incident. The California Supreme Court denied review. ==Plurality decision== Justice O'Connor wrote an opinion for herself, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justice Kennedy. Under the Eighth Amendment, a narrow proportionality principle applies to non-capital sentences. Before Ewing, the Court had from time to time examined lengthy sentences imposed for relatively minor crimes. In Rummel v. Estelle, . the Court upheld a life sentence for obtaining $120.75 by false pretenses imposed on a three-time offender under Texas's recidivist statute. In Solem v. Helm, . the Court struck down a life without parole (LWOP) sentence imposed on a defendant who had committed a seventh non-violent felony. Most recently, in Harmelin v. Michigan, the Court upheld a life without parole sentence imposed on a first-time offender convicted of possession of more than 650 grams of cocaine. Against this backdrop of case law, O'Connor said that the gross disproportionality principle contained in the Eighth Amendment would require striking down only an extreme noncapital sentence, such as a life sentence for overtime parking. Three-strikes laws, O'Connor observed, represented a new trend in criminal sentencing. \\"These laws respond[] to widespread public concerns about crime by targeting the class of offenders who pose the greatest threat to public safety: career criminals.\\" Such laws were a \\"deliberate policy choice\\" on the part of legislatures to isolate those who have \\"repeatedly engaged in serious or violent criminal behavior\\" from the rest of society in order to protect public safety. For O'Connor, the desire to punish repeat criminals more harshly was \\"no pretext\\" for the legitimate policy choice that the three-strikes law implemented. Such laws serve the valid penological goals of incapacitation and deterrence. Although California's three-strikes law may have generated some controversy, \\"we do not sit as a superlegislature to second-guess\\" the policy choices made by particular states. \\"It is enough that the State of California has a reasonable basis for believing that dramatically enhanced sentences for habitual felons advances the goals of its criminal justice system in any substantial way.\\" She noted that Ewing's crime was not simply that of stealing three golf clubs--it was stealing three golf clubs after being convicted of two violent or serious felonies. \\"In weighing the gravity of Ewing's offense, we must place on the scales not only his current felony, but also his long history of felony recidivism. Any other approach would fail to accord proper deference to the policy judgments that find expression in the legislature's choice of sanctions.\\" Ewing's sentence might be long, but it \\"reflects a rational judgment, entitled to deference, that offenders who have committed serious or violent felonies and who continue to commit felonies must be incapacitated.\\" For this reason, O'Connor reasoned that Ewing's 25-years-to- life sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment. Justice Scalia was willing to accept that the Eighth Amendment contained a gross disproportionality requirement \\"if I felt I could intelligently apply it.\\" However, because a criminal sentence can have many justifications--not simply retribution, a goal to which proportionality is inherently linked-- he thought it was impossible to intelligently apply a proportionality requirement to non-capital sentences. Even so, Justice Scalia concurred in the judgment that Ewing's sentence was constitutional. Justice Thomas believed that the Eighth Amendment contained no proportionality principle at all, and concurred in the judgment. ==Dissents== Justice Stevens explained that a proportionality principle for non-capital sentences was compatible with the Eighth Amendment. After all, judges must determine the proportionality of fines, bail, and death sentences. There should be no reason why these lesser and greater forms of punishment should be subject to a proportionality requirement, but not the length of a prison sentence. Judges have historically exercised much discretion in criminal sentencing. Much of this discretion had been conferred by legislatures, who fixed criminal penalties over very broad ranges. \\"It was not unheard of for a statute to authorize a sentence ranging from one year to life, for example.\\" In order to exercise this discretion, judges had to take into account all the goals of punishment in fixing a proportional sentence. Stevens believed that the Eighth Amendment could support such determination of proportionality. \\"I think it clear that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments expresses a broad and basic proportionality principle that takes into account all of the justifications for penal sanctions.\\" Justice Breyer conceded that successful proportionality challenges to criminal sentences should be rare, but argued that Ewing's sentence could be successfully challenged as disproportional. For Breyer, three characteristics of a sentence bear on whether it is proportional: the length of the sentence in real time, the conduct that triggered the sentence, and the offender's criminal history. Although Ewing was a recidivist, his present crime was not violent, and so he should not have been sentenced as harshly as a recidivist who had committed yet another violent crime. The experience of some federal judges, as described by data aggregated by the United States Sentencing Commission, suggested that Ewing would not have been treated so harshly under federal sentencing law. Finally, the fact that Ewing's sentence would have been the same if he had been convicted of a violent crime, like rape or murder, suggested it was too harsh a sentence for a shoplifter, even a recidivist shoplifter like Ewing. \\"Outside the California three strikes context, Ewing's recidivist sentence is virtually unique in its harshness for his offense of conviction, and by a considerable degree.\\" ==See also== * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 538 *List of United States Supreme Court cases ==NotesAmicus brief of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation * Collection of documents from the American Bar Association * Audio of oral argument -- OYEZ project, Northwestern University * Transcript of oral argument * Witkin project on California law * Press release of ACLU Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court Category:Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause case law Category:2003 in United States case law Category:2003 in California Category:Legal history of California ","title":"Ewing v.

Twenty of these writers were later tagged New Generation Poets in a promotion organised by the Poetry Society in 1994, but this particular grouping was artificial and should not be taken as a critical guide, for it excluded several key figures from that generation, including Jackie Kay, Ian McMillan, Sean O'Brien, Jo Shapcott and Matthew Sweeney. The first anthology to represent this new generation was Bloodaxe's The New Poetry (1993), edited by Michael Hulse, David Kennedy and David Morley, which became a school set text.

(1985), his book-length poem set in a vandalised cemetery in Leeds during the UK Miners‚Äô Strike which captured the angry, desolate mood of Britain in the mid-1980s. Two years after its publication, Richard Eyre‚Äôs film of the poem sparked a national furore, not over Harrison‚Äôs politics but over his skinhead protagonist‚Äôs use of ‚Äòbad language‚Äô. Attacked by Mary Whitehouse (\\"this work of singular nastiness\\") and by Tory MPs wanting Channel 4's broadcast to be stopped, the poem attracted lurid headlines in the tabloids. \\"A torrent of four-letter filth\\" was the Daily Mails description: \\"The most explicitly sexual language yet beamed into the nation‚Äôs living rooms‚Ä¶the crudest, most offensive word is used 17 times.\\" The second edition of v. (1989) documents the media reaction to the film. ==Awards== Neil Astley was awarded an honorary DLitt by Newcastle University in 1995 for his work with Bloodaxe Books. In 2000 Bloodaxe received funding from the Millennium Festival and the National Lottery through Arts Council England for an educational initiative to build a stronger awareness of 20th century poetry. This involved the publication of the literary critic Edna Longley's Bloodaxe Book of 20th Century Poetry from Britain and Ireland and Strong Words: modern poets on modern poetry. ==Other activities== In 2001 Jo Shapcott gave the first of the Newcastle/Bloodaxe poetry lectures at Newcastle University. Several other poets have since spoken about the craft and practice of poetry to audiences drawn from both the city and the university. These public lectures were published in book form in 2015 as Quantum Poetics: Newcastle/Bloodaxe Poetry Lectures. Other initiatives to introduce contemporary poetry to new readers have included working with reading groups in Nottingham and in libraries across the West Midlands. In Birmingham, Jonathan Davidson's team at Book Communications have produced three touring theatre shows which have taken live poetry performances to venues across Britain. Themes have included Staying Alive; Being Alive; and Changing Lives, which was a theatre piece using poems from books published by Bloodaxe over the previous 30 years. ==DVD-books== In 2008, Bloodaxe celebrated its 30th birthday by publishing what it believed to be the world's first poetry DVD- book, In Person: 30 Poets. In Person was filmed by the film-maker Pamela Robertson-Pearce and edited by Bloodaxe's founding editor, Neil Astley. It features six hours of readings on two DVDs by 30 poets, together with an anthology which includes all the poems read in the films. Bloodaxe's digital initiative has continued with further DVD-books featuring work by the poets John Agard and Samuel Menashe with films by Pamela Robertson-Pearce, as well as books published with audio CDs by Sarah Arvio, Jackie Kay and Galway Kinnell, and a new edition of Briggflatts by Basil Bunting featuring an audio CD of the work read by the author, and a DVD with a film portrait of Bunting made by Peter Bell in 1982. ==References * *Bloodaxe Books archive at Newcastle University's Robinson library, Special Collections * Publisher profile of Bloodaxe Books on Poetry Book Society website Category:Book publishing companies of the United Kingdom Category:Poetry publishers Category:Publishing companies established in 1978 Category:1978 establishments in England ","title":"Bloodaxe Books"},{"id":"7449408","text":"The Cauca molly (Poecilia caucana) is a freshwater fish in the family Poeciliidae, also called the South American molly.

Gordon's novels are noted for their mix of historical fact and creative fictionalized events. == Life == Gordon was brought up and educated in Buckie and Perthshire. His family's home is located at the Cairnfield estate near Arradoul. Gordon studied history at Newcastle University and was offered post-graduate work, but instead he accepted a job as a market researcher. He later left this position and made a career as a writer. After many years of writing, Gordon moved to London, where he took a course in teaching English as a foreign language. Gordon began teaching abroad in his 50s. He first taught in Poland, and then in 2003 he relocated to China. Gordon collapsed at the Lianhua Road Subway Station in the Shanghai Metro of a heart attack and died in hospital on 7 February 2009. He had been teaching at Shanghai High School International Division since 2005. ==Publications== Gordon began publishing science fiction with \\"A Light in the Sky\\" for New Worlds in 1965 as Richard A. Gordon. Later his publisher ask him to adopt a pseudonym for the risk of confusing him with the Gordon Ostlere, the author of the Doctor books who wrote under the pen-name Richard Gordon. Gordon initially adopted the pen name Alex Stuart, but was again asked to change names due to complaints from author Violet Vivian Stuart, who published historical fiction under that name. He then adopted the name Alex R. Stuart and later took on the pen name Stuart Gordon. Gordon's later work was published under his own name. One interesting note of Gordon's work is the colorful dedications he had in his earliest works, such as the following for The Bikers: To She Who Types Like a Drunken Midget Playing The Piano. While Gordon has never written fictional pieces set in Scotland, the characters in his books occasionally pass through his hometown. In his writing, Gordon often made reference to his Moray roots. In Fire in the Abyss time-warped Sir Humphrey Gilbert passes through Buckie, where Gordon grew up. In the late 1980s Gordon ventured into non-fiction and before his death he completed a number of works on the paranormal and a series of illustrated walking and history guides of northern Scotland. In addition, he wrote several articles under the pen name The Moray Rambler. Gordon's 1992 publication \\"The Paranormal: An Illustrated Encyclopedia\\" elicited the ire of Gordon Stein, the director for the Center for Inquiry, a non-profit educational organization whose primary mission is to dispel paranormal claims. Stein wrote a stinging review in the Spring 1994 issue of the Skeptical Inquirer, critiquing Gordon's usage of \\"erroneous 'information' about the paranormal\\" and usage of references that \\"are never to the skeptical literature.\\" ==Partial list of works== Works are published under pseudonym Stuart Gordon unless otherwise noted. *The Bikers (1971) - published under pen name Alex R.

California (a case with a similar subject matter),. held that there would be no relief by means of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus from a sentence imposed under California's three strikes law as a violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments. Relying on the reasoning of Ewing and Harmelin v. Michigan,. the Court ruled that because no \\"clearly established\\" law held that a three-strikes sentence was cruel and unusual punishment, the 50-years-to-life sentence imposed in this case was not cruel and unusual punishment. ==Facts== On November 4, 1995, Leandro Andrade, a nine-year Army veteran and father of three, American Bar Association - Human Rights Magazine stole five children's videotapes from a K-Mart store in Ontario, California. Two weeks later, he stole four children's videotapes from a different K-Mart store in Montclair, California. Andrade had been in and out of the state and federal prison systems since 1982. By the time of these two crimes in 1995, he had been convicted of petty theft, residential burglary, transportation of marijuana, and escape from prison. Under California's three strikes law, any felony can serve as the third \\"strike\\" and thereby expose the defendant to a mandatory sentence of 25 years to life in prison. The trial court denied Andrade's request to classify the two petty theft charges as misdemeanors, and Andrade was ultimately convicted of the two felony theft charges. As a result of his prior convictions, Andrade was sentenced to two consecutive terms of 25 years to life in prison. (The State conceded at oral argument before the U.S. Supreme Court that the California Supreme Court had decided a case since Andrade's conviction that might allow him to petition the trial court to reduce his sentence to one 25-years-to-life term.) The California Court of Appeal affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct appeal, and the California Supreme Court denied discretionary review. Andrade next filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Andrade argued that his sentence violated the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment, but the district court rejected this claim. Andrade appealed, and the Ninth Circuit, after reviewing the relevant Supreme Court decisions, concluded that the district court was wrong. The State of California asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Ninth Circuit's decision, and it agreed to do so. ==Majority opinion== Although this case involved the same legal claim as Ewing v. California, its procedural posture was different. Ewing was a case on direct review from the California state court system, meaning that the Supreme Court was deciding in the first instance whether a three-strikes sentence was cruel and unusual punishment. If the defendant in Ewing had prevailed in the Supreme Court, he would have received a new sentencing hearing. Andrade, by contrast, was an appeal from a federal habeas petition. If the Court was to reach the same result in Andrade as it did in Ewing, it had to travel a different path to arrive there. Because of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, the Court could not grant relief unless the decision of the state courts to uphold Andrade's sentence was \\"contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\\". This meant that the Court's first task was to identify what that \\"clearly established\\" law was. The Court examined its prior holdings, and found three that were relevant--Rummel v. Estelle,. Solem v. Helm,. and Harmelin v. Michigan. Although these precedents were not a \\"model of clarity\\", the Court concluded that a \\"gross disproportionality principle is applicable to sentences for terms of years\\", but that the \\"precise contours\\" of this principle were unclear and applied only in the \\"exceedingly rare and extreme case\\". In Solem, the sentence did not allow for parole, and the Court had held it was cruel and unusual; in Rummel, the sentence did allow for parole, and the Court had held it was not cruel and unusual. In this case, like in Rummel, Andrade retained the opportunity for parole, even if that possibility was remote. Because the gross disproportionality principle applied in only an extreme case, the Court concluded that the California courts did not unreasonably apply it to Andrade's sentence. ==Dissenting opinion== Justice David Souter protested that Andrade's criminal history and triggering offenses were less severe than those of the defendant in Ewing, yet Andrade received a harsher sentence. He argued that the sentence in this case was indistinguishable from that in Solem, and thus required the Court to grant relief. \\"Andrade, like the defendant in Solem, was a repeat offender who committed theft of trifling value, some $150, and their criminal records are comparable, including burglary (though Andrade's were residential), with no violent crimes or crimes against the person.\\" Because Andrade was 37 at the time of the offenses in this case, the 50-years-to-life sentence was effectively life without parole. The only way Souter could distinguish the sentence in this case and the sentence in Solem was \\"to reject the practical equivalence of a life sentence without parole and one with parole eligibility at 87\\". Moreover, the fact that California's three-strikes law embodied one penological theory -- the theory of incapacitation -- facilitated judicial review of sentences imposed under it with reference to the requirements of the Eighth Amendment. The incapacitation theory could not, Souter argued, justify sentencing a person to 25 more years in prison for an identical, trifling crime committed two weeks after the first. \\"Since the defendant's condition has not changed between the two closely related thefts, the incapacitation penalty is not open to the simple arithmetic of multiplying the punishment by two, without resulting in gross disproportion even under the State's chosen benchmark\\". For Souter, the sentence in this case presented one of those rare cases that the Eighth Amendment allowed the Court to set it aside. ==See also== * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 538 *List of United States Supreme Court cases ==ReferencesBrief of the ACLU in support of respondent Andrade * Amicus brief of Criminal Justice Legal Foundation * [ Transcript of the oral argument] Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause case law Category:2003 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Rehnquist Court Category:Legal history of California Category:Kmart ","title":"Lockyer v.

Capelle, Wageningen Academic Publishers, 2005, Starches are modified to enhance their performance in different applications. Starches may be modified to increase their stability against excessive heat, acid, shear, time, cooling, or freezing; to change their texture; to decrease or increase their viscosity; to lengthen or shorten gelatinization time; or to increase their visco-stability. ==Modification methods== starch acetate hydroxypropylated starch cationic starch carboxymethylated starch Acid-treated starch (INS 1401),Codex General Standard for Food Additives (GSFA) Online Database also called thin boiling starch, is prepared by treating starch or starch granules with inorganic acids, e.g. hydrochloric acid breaking down the starch molecule and thus reducing the viscosity. Other treatments producing modified starch (with different INS and E-numbers) are: * dextrin (INS 1400), roasted starch with hydrochloric acid * alkaline-modified starch (INS 1402) with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide * bleached starch (INS 1403) with hydrogen peroxide * oxidized starch (INS 1404, E1404) with sodium hypochlorite, breaking down viscosity * enzyme-treated starch (INS 1405), maltodextrin, cyclodextrin * monostarch phosphate (INS 1410, E1410) with phosphorous acid or the salts sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, or sodium triphosphate to reduce retrogradation * distarch phosphate (INS 1412, E1412) by esterification with for example sodium trimetaphosphate, crosslinked starch modifying the rheology, the texture * acetylated starch (INS 1420, E1420) esterification with acetic anhydride * hydroxypropylated starch (INS 1440, E1440), starch ether, with propylene oxide, increasing viscosity stability * hydroxyethyl starch, with ethylene oxide * starch sodium octenyl succinate (OSA) starch (INS 1450, E1450) used as emulsifier adding hydrophobicity * starch aluminium octenyl Succinate (INS 1452, E1452) * cationic starch, adding positive electrical charge to starch * carboxymethylated starch with monochloroacetic acid adding negative charge and combined modifications such as *phosphated distarch phosphate (INS 1413, E1413) * acetylated distarch phosphate (INS 1414, E1414) * acetylated distarch adipate (INS 1422, E1422), * hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate (INS 1442, E1442), * acetylated oxidized starch (INS 1451, E1451). Modified starch may also be a cold-water-soluble, pregelatinized or instant starch which thickens and gels without heat, or a cook-up starch which must be cooked like regular starch. Drying methods to make starches cold-water-soluble are extrusion, drum drying, spray drying or dextrinization. Other starch derivatives, the starch sugars, like glucose, high fructose syrup, glucose syrups, maltodextrins, starch degraded with amylase enzyme are mainly sold as liquid syrup to make a sweetener. ==Examples of use and functionality of modified starch== Pre-gelatinized starch is used to thicken instant desserts, allowing the food to thicken with the addition of cold water or milk. Similarly, cheese sauce granules (such as in Macaroni and Cheese or lasagna) or gravy granules may be thickened with boiling water without the product going lumpy. Commercial pizza toppings containing modified starch will thicken when heated in the oven, keeping them on top of the pizza, and then become runny when cooled. A suitably modified starch is used as a fat substitute for low-fat versions of traditionally fatty foods, e.g. industrial milk-based desserts like yogurt or reduced-fat hard salami having about 1/3 the usual fat content. For the latter type of uses, it is an alternative to the product Olestra. Modified starch is added to frozen products to prevent them from dripping when defrosted. Modified starch, bonded with phosphate, allows the starch to absorb more water and keeps the ingredients together. Modified starch acts as an emulsifier for French dressing by enveloping oil droplets and suspending them in the water. Acid-treated starch forms the shell of jelly beans. Oxidized starch increases the stickiness of batter. Carboxymethylated starches are used as a wallpaper adhesive, as textile printing thickener, as tablet disintegrants and excipients in the pharmaceutical industry. Cationic starch is used as wet end sizing agent in paper manufacturing. ==Genetically modified starch== Modified starch should not be confused with genetically modified starch, which refers to starch from genetically engineered plants, such as those that have been genetically modified to produce novel fatty acids or carbohydrates which might not occur in the plant species being harvested. In the United States the term can also refer to foods that have been created by traditional cross-breeding rather than gene splicing.1999 October 19, Statement of James H. Maryanski Ph.D, Biotechnology Coordinator, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration. In Europe the term \\"Genetically Modified Organism\\" is used solely where \\"the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally through fertilisation and/or natural recombination\\".http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/genetically-modified- organisms, European food Standards Agency, 24 April 2013 The modification in \\"genetically modified\\" refers to the genetic engineering of the plant DNA, whereas in the term \\"Modified Starch\\" seen on mandatory ingredient labels it refers to the later processing or treatment of the starch or starch granules. Genetically modified starch is of interest in the manufacture of biodegradable polymers and noncellulose feedstock in the paper industry, as well as the creation of new food additives. For example, researchers aim to alter the enzymes within living plants to create starches with desirable modified properties, and thus eliminate the need for enzymatic processing after starch is extracted from the plant.Zeeman et al. \\"Starch: Its Metabolism, Evolution, and Biotechnological Modification in Plants\\" in Annual Review of Plant Biology, 2010, http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev- arplant-042809-112301 ==See also== *Acceptable daily intake *Retrogradation (starch) *Starch gelatinization *Resistant starch ==References== *GCSE Food Technology for OCR, Jenny Ridgwell. 2001. *Revise for OCR GCSE Food Technology, Alison Winson. 2003. *Degradable Polymers, Recycling, and Plastics Waste Management.

It is directed by seven-member Board of Directors. The governor of South Carolina appoints a member from each of the state's congressional districts, in addition to one at-large board member. The board or governor may appoint citizens advisory panels to provide recommendations on agency programs. The Department of Natural Resources also oversees the state's soil and water conservation districts, which are special-purpose districts contiguous with each of South Carolina's 46 counties. Each conservation district is managed by six-member boards. Three members of each board are appointed through the Department of Natural Resources, while the other half are directly elected. ==DNR senior staff== *Director - Robert H.

Hinson (7th congressional district) ==Law enforcement== The Division of Law Enforcement is responsible for enforcement of state and federal laws that govern hunting, recreational and commercial fishing, recreational boating, and other natural resources conservation concerns. The division conducts South Carolina‚Äôs hunter and boater education courses, as well as other outreach programs including the Take One Make One and Archery in the Schools programs aimed at introducing youth to the sport of hunting. The division is responsible for investigating boating and hunting accidents, and DNR officers regularly conduct search and rescue missions in outlying areas and assist other law enforcement agencies in investigations. The Division has officers trained in underwater diving that assist in law enforcement, search and rescue, and evidence recovery missions. The Division also utilizes aircraft for law enforcement patrol, search and rescue, and other department missions. The division and its officers are called upon to provide homeland security related to water borne activities including commercial ship escorts, and hydroelectric dam, nuclear facility, and energy plant security. South Carolina's corps of natural resources enforcement officers is organized into four regions covering groups of the state's 46 counties and coastal marine shoreline and waters out to 200 miles. A 24-hour toll-free number is maintained for emergencies requiring immediate law enforcement assistance from a natural resources officer. Any person may call this number anonymously to report a conservation law violation or information that could lead to the arrest of a violator and become eligible for a cash reward through the Operation Game Thief Program. ==History and purposeThe department=== The agency as organized on July 1, 1994, under the S.C. Restructuring Act is composed of the former Wildlife and Marine Resources Department, Water Resources Commission (non-regulatory programs), Land Resources Commission (non-regulatory programs), State Geological Survey (State Geologist), and S.C. Migratory Waterfowl Committee. These have been combined into the present division structure. Alvin A. Taylor is the current director of the agency. ===The board=== The SCDNR is governed by the seven-member S.C. Natural Resources Board, with one member representing each of the state's six Congressional Districts and one at large. The board meets monthly. Citizen advisory committees meet periodically. The public is invited to attend all meetings, and comment is encouraged. Upcoming meetings are announced through news releases, local newspapers, or the DNR News and Video Section. Also, SCDNR Board Meeting minutes are available as they are approved by the Board. ==See also== *List of State Fish and Wildlife Management Agencies in the U.S. *List of law enforcement agencies in South Carolina ==References * Natural Resources Category:State environmental protection agencies of the United States Category:Natural resources agencies in the United States Category:Environment of South Carolina ","title":"South Carolina Department of Natural Resources"},{"id":"7449578","text":"Murdock MacQuarrie (25 August 1878 in San Francisco, California - 22 August 1942 in Los Angeles, California) was an American silent film actor and director.

Forewing: discoidal streak narrow, the apex truncate, triangular spot beyond narrow, very elongate; discal spots small, oval, all well separated; postdiscal transverse series of spots complete. Hindwing: subbasal band very narrow, slightly sinuous; discal and subterminal pale lines very obscure; postdiscal series of spots transverse, very narrow, often indicated only by a pale band. Jayanti in Buxa Tiger Reserve in Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal, India Underside chocolate reddish brown, markings as on the upperside, but broader and slightly diffuse. Forewing with the discoidal streak and the triangular spot beyond it diffusely connate (united with others), some transverse linear white markings on either side of the postdiscal series of spots; the wing below vein 1 pale greyish brown. Hindwing: the discal and subterminal pale markings of the upperside represented by more clearly defined, very narrow, white bands, with, in the female, the addition of a terminal white similar band. Antennae black; head, thorax and abdomen fuliginous black; beneath dusky white. ===Dry-season form=== Dry-season form at Jayanti in Buxa Tiger Reserve Males and females, upperside ground colour a more dusky fuliginous; the markings broader and slightly whiter, not sullied white. Underside: ground colour a shade brighter. Race kallaura, Moore. Of this form I have seen only a few specimens. Judging by the types, which are now in the collection of the British Museum, it differs less from the typical form than do any of the other races. As in N. soma, the markings are small and narrow; the subbasal band of the hindwing is, however, attenuated at each end, and not of even width, underside: ground colour very much paler and somewhat ochraceous, the anterior and posterior sets of spots of the discal series closer together respectively; the postdiscal band on the hindwing equal in width to the subbasal band. Recorded only so far from Travancore. Race hampsoni, Moore. Very closely allied to the typical form, but the markings pure white and broader in both seasonal forms, as in the race clinia. Upperside forewing: the spots of the discal series oval, outwardly rounded. Underside: ground colour dark ferruginous, the markings broad as on the upperside; the spots of the discal series, though closer to each other than in the typical form, still not connate, or forming an upper and lower band as in the race clinia. Recorded from the Nilgiris; Anaimalai Hills and Mysore. ==Subspecies== The subspecies of Neptis soma are: *N. s. soma - Nepal, northeast India *N. s. ominicola - China *N. s. tushita - Siam *N. s. acala - Tonkin *N. s. shania - Myanmar, Thailand, China *N. s. somaoides - Kawi *N. s. pendleburyi - peninsular Malaya *N. s. tayalina - Taiwan *N. s. butleri - Pakistan - Nepal *N. s. shirozui - Taiwan *N. s. palnica - south India ==Gallery== Image:Sullied Sailor (Neptis soma) at Jayanti, Duars, WB W IMG 5429.jpgDry-season form at Jayanti in Buxa Tiger Reserve in Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal Image:NsomaDSC 2993.jpgMuseum specimen from Malaya ==See also== *List of butterflies of India *List of butterflies of India (Nymphalidae) ==References== soma Category:Butterflies of Asia Category:Butterflies of India Category:Butterflies of Indochina Category:Butterflies described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Neptis soma"},{"id":"7449594","text":"\\"Ne crois pas\\" (, Don't believe) is a song that was performed in the Eurovision Song Contest 1956 by French singer Mich√®le Arnaud. It was the first of two Luxembourgish entries in the contest and was performed in French. In contrast to most of the other entries of this Contest, the song is an up-tempo number, with Arnaud telling a friend or lover that the fact that he looks good at the moment is largely meaningless. She tells him that his looks are due to his youth and that, as for the rest of humanity, he will lose his hair, gain weight and possibly lose his teeth as well. Thus, she tells him that he should \\"take advantage of it\\", rather than simply enjoying his looks at the time. The song was performed sixth on the night (following France's Math√© Alt√©ry with \\"Le temps perdu\\" and preceding Italy's Franca Raimondi with \\"Aprite le finestre\\"). As the scoreboard of this Contest has never been released, definitive statements about scores and positions are impossible to make, however the song did not win. The song was accompanied at the 1956 contest by Arnaud with \\"Les amants de minuit\\" and was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1957 contest by Dani√®le Dupr√© with \\"Amours mortes (tant de peine)\\". ==Sources and external links== * Official Eurovision Song Contest site, history by year, 1956. * Detailed info and lyrics, The Diggiloo Thrush, \\"Ne crois pas\\".

ConEuc was designed for concurrent, high performance, highly reliable system software, such as operating systems, compilers and embedded microprocessor systems. The TUNIS operating system, a Unix variant, was implemented entirely in Concurrent Euclid. ConEuc extends a core subset of Euclid with processes and monitors (as specified by C.A.R. Hoare) as well as language constructs needed for systems programming including separate compilation, variables at absolute addresses, type converters, long integers and other features. ConEuc was implemented by a small (50k bytes), fast, portable compiler that was self-compiling and had replaceable code generators. High quality code generators for several computers, including the PDP-11, VAX-11, Motorola 68000 and Motorola 6809 were developed that produced code comparable to the best C compilers. Concurrent Euclid programs that used concurrency could be run on a bare machine (supported by a small assembly language kernel), or in simulated mode as an ordinary process running under an operating system. The Turing programming language is a direct descendant of Concurrent Euclid and its Turing Plus variant eventually replaced ConEuc in most applications. ==References== *J.R. Cordy and R.C. Holt 1980.

It was created in 1989 by the Washington State Legislature to create a plan to replace the old Spokane Coliseum. The Coliseum was eventually replaced by the Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena. The SPFD recently completed a expansion of the Convention Center by building the Exhibit Halls. ==District History== After several attempts to replace the Spokane Coliseum, the Spokane Public Facilities District was created in 1989 by the Washington State Legislature by virtue of RCW 36.100. The Legislature appropriated $500,000 to the District to commence operations. The District is a municipal corporation. It is an independent taxing authority and a taxing district as defined in the state Constitution. The boundaries are coextensive with the boundaries of Spokane County. As defined by the Legislature, the SPFD was authorized to \\"acquire, construct, own and operate sports and entertainment facilities with contiguous parking facilities.\\" It has a five person Board of Directors. Two directors are appointed by the City of Spokane, two are appointed by Spokane County, and one is appointed by the other directors. The District manages and maintains the Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena, Spokane Convention Center and First Interstate Center for the Arts. ===Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena=== In the spring of 1990, the District Board published a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for an economic feasibility/market analysis. Laventhol & Horwath (now Price Waterhouse) was hired to help determine the type, size and location of a new facility to replace the Coliseum. David Petersen of L & H conducted over 40 interviews with local area elected officials, user groups, citizens and promoters as part of this study. Nine sites were evaluated for possible location of a new facility. The Board subsequently voted unanimously to accept the recommendations of the Laventhol & Horwath study, as follows: :Type: An arena was chosen over a domed stadium. :Size: 12,000 to 14,000 with the capability for future expansion. :Location: On City-owned land east of the Coliseum, with on-site parking for 2,000 automobiles. A ballot proposition was placed on the County general election ballot in November 1990 with two issues: (1) a property tax bond issue of $38 million to finance construction; and (2) a measure to validate the District, which would allow it to impose a two percent hotel/motel room tax on properties of 40 or more units. The second measure passed while the first failed to get the super majority needed for approval. In December 1990 the City of Spokane and Spokane County each issued $15.4 million in bonds to preserve tax-exempt status. This was the basis of the first Interlocal Cooperation Agreement among the District, City and County. Over that winter the Board again met with local elected officials and community leaders to discuss the concept of a one-tenth of one percent sales tax measure. Local area legislators (primarily Senator Jim West and Representative Bill Day) worked to obtain legislative support of a bill to allow the District to seek voter approval of such a measure. The one-tenth of one percent sales tax measure was placed on the primary election ballot in September 1991 and received the approval of Spokane County voters, thus completing the financing needed to construct the Arena. The ballot proposition specified the cost of the facility at $44.8 million and stated that all funds would be used for the Arena project. Both taxes were imposed on January 1, 1992. Ceremonial groundbreaking occurred on March 5, 1993. The Arena opened in September 1995 and has been a remarkable success for the community. Since opening its doors, the Arena has sold millions of tickets and hosted a variety of events including 5 sold-out Garth Brooks concerts, Elton John, Nickelback, Brad Paisley, Carrie Underwood, numerous Men's and Women's NCAA Basketball Championship events, the record-breaking 2007 and 2010 US Figure Skating Championships, Walking with Dinosaurs, and Star Wars: In Concert, amongst others. In April 2012, the District went back to voters with a ballot measure to extend the two percent hotel/motel room tax, providing the District with the financing to add additional space to the Spokane Convention Center, complete work on the Spokane Riverbank, and upgrade the seating structures in the Arena. ===Spokane Convention Center=== In August 2002, the Board revised the District's Mission Statement to include other projects as the original PFD was created for the construction of the Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena only. Following a report issued by the Facilities 2000 Working Group they recommended that the PFD take on other projects, due to the successful operation of the Arena. There are three main projects: :*The expansion of the existing convention center (CCX) :*The Fair and Expo Center Grandstand :*CenterPlace at Mirabeau Point The 5-member Board began their due diligence, to determine if it was fiscally feasible. On May 21, 2002, Spokane County voters overwhelmingly authorized the Regional Projects including a significant expansion of the Spokane Convention Center and the new projects at both the Fair and Expo Center and at Mirabeau Point. The Board determined that the site for Convention Center Expansion (CCX) must be adjacent to and attached to the existing Convention Center and Ag Trade Center. Sites to both the east and to the south were evaluated. Geotechnical work on both sites was completed and both sites could accommodate a 100,000 sq.ft exhibit hall, new lobby and loading areas, covered connections between the facilities and on-site parking. The District completed the site selection process for the CCX project and in August 2003 approved the purchase of the property to the east of the existing facility and property on the block to the south. The 100,000 square-foot Exhibit Hall was located on the East site. On September 2, 2003 the management of the Spokane Opera House, now the First Interstate Center for the Arts, and Convention Center was transferred to the Spokane Public Facilities District. There was a special \\"Passing of the Keys\\" ceremony involving representatives for the PFD and the City of Spokane. After consideration of every management alternative, the District hired a core group of employees to operate and manage all the facilities and will continue to rely heavily on contract services for many of the day-to-day operational tasks. The official ground breaking ceremony for the Convention Center Expansion took place on July 1, 2004. The expansion was completed ahead of schedule and a dedication ceremony occurred on July 19, 2006. A public open house was held the following day and well attended. The portion of the CC that was constructed for the 1974 Worlds Fair was completely remodeled and opened on time and on budget in May 2007. The CCX was awarded LEED Silver Certification in 2007, by the US Green Building Council, making it just the third convention center structure in the country to be awarded with such a distinction. As of 2010, the previously existing Convention Center facility was awarded LEED Silver Certification for existing buildings. In April 2012, the District went back to voters with a ballot measure to extend the two percent hotel/motel room tax, providing the District with the financing to add additional space to the Spokane Convention Center, complete work on the Spokane Riverbank, and upgrade the seating structures in the Arena. ===First Interstate Center for the Arts=== Constructed for Expo '74, the First Interstate Center for the Arts is home to WestCoast Entertainment's Annual \\"Best of Broadway\\" Series and many iconic performances by legendary artists and family shows.

Luke is a young swordsman who has been living in a mansion in the Kimlasca Kingdom for seven years after being kidnapped and suffering from amnesia. His pampered life turns upside down when he unwittingly becomes the target of a military-religious organization known as the Order of Lorelei, who believe him to be the key to an ancient prophecy. Across his journey, Luke fights to stop an impending war and matures as a person. He has also appeared in the anime and manga versions of the game as well other games within the Tales series. Namco's staff created Luke to be a flawed person who, despite being unlikable because of his personality, would mature across the game. He was designed by K≈çsuke Fujishima who wanted his appearance to show his laziness, a sense of fashion, as well as the fact he practises martial arts. Critical reception to Luke's character has ranged from negative to positive based on his development in Tales of the Abyss. While initially seen as an unlikable person, his growth into a respectable hero across the story arc received praise from critics. He has also appeared in multiple Tales polls where he has been voted as one of the series' most popular characters. ==Creation and design== Yuri Lowenthal voices Luke in the English dub Makoto Yoshizumi, the producer of Tales of the Abyss explained that studio staff made the protagonist, Luke, unlikable by being \\"selfish\\" and \\"annoying\\" at the outset of the game. These negative personality traits were designed to cause gamers to dislike him but over the course of the game, he would mature into someone so likable that the other main characters would comment, \\"Huh, Luke's not that bad\\". While such a character could turn off many players, Yoshizumi preferred a cast of \\"flawed characters\\" rather than a story in which \\"the fated protagonist had a perfect life and a perfect upbringing, and he grew up to defeat the demon king\\". During early promotions of the games, one of the staff members, Yasuhiro Fukaya, noted multiple fans disliked the character. However, upon ending the game which developed him, fans started liking him. Fukuya shared the same feelings to the point of calling Luke his favorite Tales character. The staff wanted Luke to gradually change across the narrative so that players would notice his character arc and feel him likable during this process. Another important part involving Luke was how he starts bonding with the playable characters in the story and find how they start working together. Although Luke is the protagonist of the game, the staff commented that his relationship with Asch is also one of the main themes, describing them as almost the same character. Character designer K≈çsuke Fujishima noted that while Luke's clothing makes him look lazy, it was okay to have clothes that are outrageous since the setting was designed to have him wear the most fashionable clothes of his time. He decided to show Luke's abdomen to demonstrate that he was a combatant in the game. Fujishima remains anxious about Luke's design wondering what people think about his abdomen always showing. Luke's pose is the result of Fujishima's research in fashion books which feature images of boys who look like they hang out at Shibuya. Luke's English voice actor is Yuri Lowenthal,) who noted he could relate to the character because of his selfish nature and comically noted he lacked Luke's development. His Japanese voice actor is Chihiro Suzuki, who was chosen over Yasunori Matsumoto, who also wanted the role. Suzuki had no idea of the game's setting or how Luke looked since there were no images. He was told to use Shibuya as an image. Suzuki enjoyed doing the audio drama of the series and ended up confused in regards to who was the final character to appear in the game's ending. Overall, Suzuki enjoyed Luke's characterization. ==Appearances== alt= The main protagonist of the game, Luke is 17 and is the only son of a noble family in the kingdom of Kimlasca-Lanvaldear. After being kidnapped at age ten, Luke lost all of his childhood memories, and after being returned home was confined to the safety of the fon Fabre manor. His isolation leads him to become a rather immature, selfish individual with next to no knowledge of the world. His only hobby is swordsmanship. During a training session with Van Grants, Luke tries to protect his teacher from the assassin Tear Grants and the two are transported to the outer world. On his way back, Luke meets Colonel Jade Curtiss from the Malkuth forces who requests his help to stop an impending war using his status as a noble. When reuniting with Van, he learns he possesses the ability to create a \\"hyperresonance\\" on his own, an extremely powerful ability when two fonists of the same type use their abilities in tandem. Luke is convinced by his teacher to use his power to become a hero and stop war so that he would not be used as a weapon. Van manipulates him into using the hyperresonance to save the town of Akzeriuth from miasma and become a hero. However, this results in the town's destruction and Luke losing everyone's trust. After Akzeriuth's destruction, Luke learns that he is actually a seven-year-old isofonically identical \\"replica\\" of Asch, the real Luke fon Fabre. This event, along with the abandonment of his friends, prompts Luke to change himself for the better, cutting his hair as a symbol of his resolve. He also asks Tear to look after him and to watch over him. Across the game, Luke also develops feelings for her to the point he once tries to confess them but decides not to. He then starts working with his comrades to protect the towns like Akzeriuth from being destroyed by using his hyperressonance on the Sephiroth trees. He fights Van, who wishes to create a new world of replicas, and emerges victorious. A month after Van's defeat, Luke and his comrades become concerned with the appearance of miasma in the world. With no way of making it go away, Luke eventually decides to sacrifice himself alongside the new replica to destroy the miasma. Although he survives, a doctor later tells him he has little time to live. As he is dying Asch gives Luke what remains of his power allowing him to perform Second Order hyperressonance. Luke then confronts Van once again using his powers to free the spirit of Lorelei. After Van's death, Luke, along with Asch's corpse, is engulfed in a blinding light as Luke frees Lorelei. One year after the battle on Eldrant, and three years after the start of his initial journey, Luke is presumed to be dead. However, on the night of his coming of age ceremony, his twentieth birthday, Luke reunites with his friends. Luke reprises his role from the game in the manga and anime adaptations of the series, as well as in the manga spin-off Tales of the Abyss: Asch: the Bloody. The Tales of the Abyss fandisc also features two segments where Luke roleplays with Tear and goes to visit a doctor, Jade. Luke also appears in Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology and the sequels Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology 2 and Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology 3 as a playable character. In Tales of the Heroes: Twin Brave, Luke appears in Guy's serious scenario as his partner. He is also playable in Tales of VS. Outside the Tales series, he also appears in the PlayStation Portable version of Venus & Braves. ==Reception== Critical reception to Luke fon Fabre has ranged from negative to positive based on his appearances in Tales of the Abyss. Based on his first impression of the game, Jeff Haynes from IGN called Luke a \\"spoiled and sheltered child\\" and noted how he was the opposite of Tear. GameSpot's Ashton Raze noted that Luke \\"is highly obnoxious, at least at first, and the way the other characters riff off his behavior is entertaining.\\" Casey Brienza from Anime News Network (ANN) saw Luke's interactions with Cheagle Mieu as a big appeal in the anime's second episode. \\"Anyone who has ever briefly nurtured homicidal thoughts when confronted by yet another cute anime creature will rejoice at his comedic whack-a-mole treatment and die laughing at his instantaneous hatred of its high-pitched squeal\\". Carl Kimlinger also from ANN found the character irritating. Christian Nutt of GamesRadar noted that Luke will probably annoy most players saying \\"though any guy who's made it through his teens will wince... this stuff cuts close to the bone.\\" He also annoys the game's other characters and \\"when the first big plot twist hits, they take it out on him - too much\\". Alex Fuller of RPGamer commented that: \\"The exceedingly good handling of character development is easily Abyss' biggest storytelling strength. Luke's journey from selfish and sheltered brat into the final hero of the game is plotted superbly.\\" Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer commented that Luke, in particular, stands out within the RPG genre's heroes \\"as his evolution from spoiled brat to worthy hero is enjoyably organic.\\" RPGFan's Abraham Ashton Liu commented that Luke was highly different from previous Tales protagonists because of his prominent unlikable traits which made his growth in the game highly notable. Richard Eisbeins from Kotaku also praised Luke's character development in a review of the anime. He commented that while \\"Luke starts the series as one of the most unlikable protagonists in all anime\\", it \\"becomes less and less prominent over the first eight episodes of the series‚Äîas he develops a hero complex of sorts which drives him into the jaws of disaster. From that point on, however, he tries frantically to be better than he was‚Äîto think for himself and to do what he feels is right. And despite the occasional minor setback, he succeeds.\\" Game Informers Kimberley Wallace praised the development of the character as well as his relationship with Tear, commenting the two had one of the best moments in the game during the ending. On the other hand, Keza MacDonald of IGN felt his character development was \\"from total obnoxious jerk to slightly less of an obnoxious jerk\\" as the other characters were more likable than him. UK Anime Network's Kevin Leathers said that while Luke's development lacked originality, in the end manages to entertains players. In a Famitsu poll from 2010, Luke was voted as the forty-ninth best video game character. He has also appeared in official Tales popularity polls where he was voted as one of the most popular characters from the series. He appeared third in the fourth poll, while in the following two he was fourth. In another poll in 2014, he was voted second. The character has also been popular with cosplayers. ==See also== *Characters of Tales of the Abyss ==References== Category:Clone characters in video games Category:Fictional swordsmen in video games Category:Male characters in video games Category:Male characters in anime and manga Category:Namco protagonists Category:Role-playing video game characters Category:Tales characters Category:Video game characters in anime and manga Category:Video game characters introduced in 2005 Category:Video game protagonists ","title":"Luke fon Fabre"},{"id":"7449662","text":"Rahel Sanzara (also Sansara; pseudonym for Johanna Bleschke) (9 February 1894 ‚Äì 8 February 1936) was a German dancer, actress and novelist. == Biography == Johanna Bleschke was the oldest of a town musician's four children. After graduating from a school for 'higher daughters', she went into an apprenticeship as a bookbinder in Blankenburg. In 1913 she moved to Berlin, where she met physician and author Ernst Weiss. Their relationship lasted for more than twenty years, and she acted in productions of Weiss' dramas. After a short stint as a wartime nurse in 1914/15 she received an education as a dancer and launched a successful career. Since 1916 she also worked successfully as a movie actress and received actress training from Otto Falckenberg in Munich, and found employment first in Prague, and from 1921 to 1924 at the Landestheater Darmstadt. Her first novel Das verlorene Kind (The Lost Child) was published in 1926 and caused great controversy for its subject matter, the lust murder of a four-year-old girl by an older boy. The book, based on a real 19th century crime case and drawing from both genres of detective novel and psychological drama received rave reviews and quickly saw several editions and was translated into eleven languages. It is still in print and continues to sell well today. Rahel Sanzara was to be awarded the respected Kleist-Preis in 1926, but she turned it down. Her subsequent novels couldn't repeat her debut's success. In 1927, Rahel Sanzara married the Jewish stock broker Walter Davidsohn, who emigrated to France to escape persecution from the Nazis, while she remained in Berlin, already weakened by cancer. She died in 1936 after a long illness. == Literary works == * Das verlorene Kind (The lost child) (Novel 1926) , LCCN 29022338. * Die gl√ºckliche Hand (in: Vossische Zeitung March 1933; Novel, Z√ºrich 1936) * Hochzeit der Armen (Novel, unpublished and lost) == Filmography == * Der Fall Routt...!

In single skating, her best result at an ISU Championship was sixth at the 2009 European Championships. In 2010, she switched to pair skating, teaming up with Alexander Enbert. They appeared at one ISU Championship, the 2011 European Championships where they placed fourth. == Career  Single skating === Gerboldt became interested in figure skating at the age of six. Gerboldt denied the assertion that her parents named her \\"Katarina\\" in honor of Katarina Witt, and stated that her parents had indeed wanted her to become a sportswoman, but not specifically a figure skater. The 2008-09 season was a turning point in Gerboldt's career. She won the bronze medal at the 2009 Russian Championships and, as both the gold and silver medalists Adelina Sotnikova and Elizaveta Tuktamysheva were too young to participate in international competition, was named to the European Championships team. She placed sixth, skating with a drainage in her nose due to sinusitis. She was coached by Tatiana Mishina and Alexei Mishin in Saint Petersburg until 2009 when she moved to CSKA Moscow and began working with Svetlana Sokolovskaya. === Pair skating === Gerboldt/Enbert at 2010 Cup of Russia After an unsuccessful 2009‚Äì10 season, Tatiana Druchinina suggested to Gerboldt that she switch to pair skating. Gerboldt moved back to Saint Petersburg, where coaches Tamara Moskvina and Artur Dmitriev asked her to try out with Alexander Enbert, whom she knew since childhood. The new partnership was announced in March 2010. During the 2010‚Äì11 season, Gerboldt/Enbert made their international debut at the 2010 Cup of Nice, which they won. They finished fourth at the 2010 Cup of Russia, their sole 2010-11 Grand Prix event. At the 2011 Russian Nationals, they placed fourth in the short program and fifth in the long, to finish fourth overall. As Tatiana Volosozhar / Maxim Trankov were ineligible to compete at the 2011 European Championships, Gerboldt/Enbert were named in2 the team for the event. They placed fifth in the short program with a new personal best score of 57.50, fourth in the free program, also with a new personal best (112.45), and finished fourth overall with 169.95 points, their best combined total. In the 2011‚Äì12 season, Gerboldt/Enbert competed in one Grand Prix event, the 2011 Cup of Russia. In 2012‚Äì13, they were assigned to Skate Canada but withdrew due to injury ‚Äì Gerboldt tore a ligament. She underwent surgery on August 2 ‚Äì a week after the injury ‚Äì and on October 3. Coached by Oleg Vasiliev, Gerboldt/Enbert returned to competition in the 2013‚Äì14 season but split in April 2014. On July 12, 2014, it was announced that she had teamed up with French singles skater Brian Joubert. In November 2014, however, Joubert confirmed his competitive retirement.

The first sightings were made on 21 December when the crew of a Safe Air Ltd cargo aircraft began observing a series of strange lights around their Armstrong Whitworth AW.660 Argosy aircraft, which tracked along with their aircraft for several minutes before disappearing and then reappearing elsewhere, the UFO was very large and had five white flashing lights that were visible on the craft. Some people say that they could see some little disks drop from the UFO and then disappear. The pilots described some of the lights to be the size of a house and others small but flashing brilliantly. These objects appeared on the air traffic controller radar in Wellington and also on the aircraft's on-board radar. On 30 December 1978, a television crew from Australia recorded background film for a network show of interviews about the sightings. For many minutes at a time on the flight to Christchurch, unidentified lights were observed by five people on the flight deck, were tracked by Wellington Air Traffic Controllers, and filmed in colour by the television crew. One object reportedly followed the aircraft almost until landing. The cargo plane then took off again with the television crew still on board, heading for Blenheim. When the aircraft reached about 2000 feet, it encountered a gigantic lighted orb which fell into station off the wing tip and tracked along with the cargo aircraft for almost quarter of an hour, while being filmed, watched, tracked on the aircraft radar and described on a tape recording made by the TV film crew. A spate of sightings followed the initial report and an Air Force Skyhawk was put on stand-by to investigate any positive sightings. ==Investigation== Following the sightings, the Royal New Zealand Air Force, the police and the Carter Observatory in Wellington cooperated in an investigation, the results of which were lodged in the National Archives in Wellington. The New Zealand Ministry of Defence attributed the sightings to lights from squid boats reflected off clouds, unburnt meteors, or lights from the planet Venus or trains and cars. In December 2010, New Zealand military released a classified report on the incident under the freedom of information law, which concludes the same thing. ==See also== *List of reported UFO sightings *UFO sightings in New Zealand ==ReferencesFurther reading== * The Kaikoura UFOs. .

Its name simply means \\"boulevard\\" in Serbian. Bulevar is not a traditional city neighborhood; it is rather an informal neighborhood that includes parts of several traditional city quarters that are situated around 3 km long Liberation Boulevard (Serbian: Bulevar osloboƒëenja), the main street in Novi Sad. ==Location== New street sign Welcome to Bulevar - billboard in Bulgarian language in Bulevar, posted during EXIT 2010 music festival Bulevar is situated between the city's train station and Liberty Bridge. It includes parts of the traditional neighborhoods of: Banatiƒá, Sajmi≈°te, Grbavica, Rotkvarija, Stari Grad, and Liman. ==History== Liberation Boulevard was built in several phases, from 1962 until the late seventies. In that time, the new boulevard cut through the old housings establishing major communication lines. Until 1991, the name of the boulevard was Bulevar 23. oktobra (23 October Boulevard), in honour of October 23, 1944 when Novi Sad was liberated from Axis occupation. Today, every bus line in the city (except bus line 1) passes through Liberation Boulevard, making it the most important and busiest street in Novi Sad. ==Features== Bulevar is also regarded as an informal city centre. Although most of the important political and cultural institutions are situated in the traditional city centre known as Stari Grad, Bulevar is a main place in the city for business and leisure activities. Almost every bank in Serbia has its offices in Bulevar, while the headquarters of some important companies (for example Oil Industry of Serbia and Elektrovojvodina) are also located in this area. There are also many bars, shops, restaurants, and one market.

Established in , Leones are the third most successful team in the Dominican Winter League, behind Tigres del Licey and Aguilas Cibae√±as, having won 17 national championships and 4 Caribbean Series. Of the 17 won championships, 16 are of the Liga Domininana de B√©isbol (LIDOM) Winter League. Leones defeated Tigres del Licey in 6 games to win the 2015-2016 championship, in a best-of-nine series with 5 over 1 games won. In the 2014 Baseball Caribbean Series to be played in Hermosillo, they represented Dominican Republic but lost the final 4-3 to the Mexican team Yaquis de Obreg√≥n. Leones beat Yaquis in their first two matchups and finished the Caribbean Series with the best record 5-2, including the final. ==History== The Leones' record book is dominated by the Alou brothers: Matty, Felipe and Jes√∫s. The brothers hold the first, second and third spots in the team's record book for the following: games played, runs, at bats, hits, home runs and RBIs. Matty and Felipe are one-two in several more categories, including walks and stolen bases. Felipe Alou is also the most successful manager, winning four championships. ===2009-10 Season=== The Leones enjoyed a very successful first year with new ownership. They won their third straight \\"City Championship Trophy\\" over Tigres del Licey, their rivals who share Estadio Quisqueya in Santo Domingo, after winning six of their ten regular season games against Licey. They followed this by winning the regular season with a 30-19 record, and won their thirteenth Winter League Championship, ending their 18-year National Championship drought. Leones represented the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean Series, and won their third title with a 5-1 record. ===2010-11 Season=== On 20 March 2010, General Manager Mois√©s Alou announced that Ken Oberkfell will return to manage Leones del Escogido for the 2010-2011 season. The team won their fourth straight City Championship Trophy this season, securing the season series with their win over Licey on 9 December. Leones made it to the postseason, but failed to reach the finals, which were eventually won by Toros del Este. ===2011-12 Season=== After struggling in the regular season, Leones clinched a spot in the Round Robin. They finished the Round Robin in first place, setting up a 9-game Finals against Aguilas. Despite blowing a commanding 3-0 series lead, Leones won their fourteenth championship in dramatic fashion with a come from behind win in game 9. Leones also won the Caribbean Series hosted by Dominican Republic. ===2012-13 Season=== Leones again struggled in the regular season, but won their final three games to force a one-game playoff against Gigantes del Cibao. Leones won the game 5-2, and joined √Åguilas Cibae√±as, Toros del Este, and Estrellas Orientales in the Round Robin. √Åguilas and Leones advanced to the Final, ending the Round Robin in 17 games. Leones swept √Åguilas in 5 games to win their third crown in four years and their fifteenth overall. Leones cruised in the Caribbean Series group stage, winning 5 out of 6 games, but lost the final to Mexico in 18 innings 4-3. ===2013-14 Season=== On 1 December 2013, Leones beat Tigres del Licey 1-0 and secured the City Championship Trophy. Leones won the regular season with 31-19, qualifying for the Round Robin. On 14 January 2014, Jon Leicester, Ramon Garcia, Fernando Rodney, and Armando Rodriguez threw a combined no-hitter to Licey, clinching the Round Robin and home field advantage in the Finals. It was just the 8th no-hitter in the history of Dominican Winter League. They faced Tigres del Licey in the Finals, losing the series 5-3. ===2014-15 Season=== Leones had a disappointing season, finishing in last place with a 17-3 record. Licey also failed to reach the playoffs, making it the first time in the league's history that both teams from Santo Domingo missed the postseason. ===2015-16 Season=== Leones finished the season with a 25-25 record, enough for third place in the standings and qualifying to the semifinal round. After 18 games in the semifinals, Leones and Toros del Este were tied with a 9-9 record, and had to play a decisive extra game, which Leones won 7-2. This sent the team to the finals against archrivals Tigres del Licey, just one year after they both failed to qualify for the postseason for the first time in history. In the best-of-nine finals, Leones jumped to a commanding 4-0 lead, before losing game 5 in the 9th inning. The team won their 16th Championship in game 6, when they defeated the Tigres del Licey 8-3. In the 2016 Caribbean Series celebrated in Estadio Quisqueya, Leones finished in last place with a 0-4 record. ==Championship history== Leones del Escogido won the first championship in 1922 of a short-lived professional baseball era from 1922 to 1937, but only the current Winter League format established in 1951 is widely accepted. {  - !Season !Champion !Manager !Runner-up - 1922 Leones del Escogido Luis Alfau Tigres del Licey - 1955-56 Leones del Escogido Frank Genovese √Åguilas Cibae√±as - 1956-57 Leones del Escogido Red Davis Tigres del Licey - 1957-58 Leones del Escogido Salty Parker Estrellas Orientales - 1959-60 Leones del Escogido Pete Reiser Estrellas Orientales - 1960-61 Leones del Escogido Pepe Lucas √Åguilas Cibae√±as - 1968-69 Leones del Escogido Andy Gilbert Estrellas Orientales - 1980-81 Leones del Escogido Felipe Rojas Alou √Åguilas Cibae√±as - 1981-82 Leones del Escogido Felipe Rojas Alou Estrellas Orientales - 1987-88 Leones del Escogido Phil Regan Estrellas Orientales - 1988-89 Leones del Escogido Phil Regan Tigres del Licey - 1989-90 Leones del Escogido Felipe Rojas Alou √Åguilas Cibae√±as - 1991-92 Leones del Escogido Felipe Rojas Alou Estrellas Orientales - 2009-10 Leones del Escogido Ken Oberkfell Gigantes del Cibao - 2011-12 Leones del Escogido Ken Oberkfell Aguilas Cibae√±as - 2012-13 Leones del Escogido Audo Vicente Aguilas Cibae√±as - 2015-16 Leones del Escogido Luis Rojas Tigres del Licey } ==Caribbean Series Championships== Leones del Escogido have won four Caribbean Series in their history. { - !Year!!Host City!!Champion!!Record - 1988 Santo Domingo Leones del Escogido style=\\"text-align:center;\\"4-2 - 1990 Miami Leones del Escogido style=\\"text-align:center;\\"5-1 - 2010 Margarita Island Leones del Escogido style=\\"text-align:center;\\"5-1 - 2012 Santo Domingo Leones del Escogido style=\\"text-align:center;\\"4-2 } ==Notable players== *Felipe Alou *Jes√∫s Alou *Matty Alou *Angel Baez Aquino *Rafael Bautista *Wilson Betemit *Mario Brito *Starlin Castro *Francisco Cordero *Jos√© DeLe√≥n *Octavio Dotel *Juan Encarnaci√≥n *Julio Franco *Rafael Furcal *Pedro Guerrero *Wilton Guerrero *Ramon Emilio Jimenez *Rufino Linares *Francisco Liriano *Pepe Lucas *Juan Marichal *Starling Marte *Quinton McCracken *Ra√∫l Mondes√≠ *Jos√© \\"Makey\\" Moreno *Jos√© Nu√±ez *David Ortiz *Neifi P√©rez *Tony Polanco *Luis Pujols *Steve Ratzer *Tim Raines *Alex Rodriguez *Juan Samuel *Liam Sheldon *Sammy Sosa *Mario Soto *Yoshitomo Tsutsugoh *Juan Uribe *Tim Wallach *Enrique Wilson Current Roster 2016-17' { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" - !

On 4 August a second, much larger relief force, called the Eight-Nation Alliance, marched from Tientsien (Tianjin) toward Peking.

William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: Heroism, Hubris, and the Ideal Missionary. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland. pp. 163-165. Different sources give slightly different numbers. Austria, Italy, and Germany‚Äîalthough they were members of the Eight-Nation Alliance‚Äîcontributed no significant number of soldiers to the relief force at this time. The route of the Eight-Nation Alliance force to relieve the Siege of the Legations In Peking, August 1900. The Alliance forces defeated the Chinese army at the Battle of Beicang (Peitsang) on 5 August and the Battle of Yangcun (Yangtsun) on 6 August and reached Tongzhou (Tongchou), 14 miles from Peking, on 12 August.Fleming, Peter (1959). The Siege at Peking: The Boxer Rebellion New York: Dorset Press. pp. 184-189. The relief force was much reduced by heat exhaustion and sunstroke and the men available for the assault on Peking probably did not greatly exceed 10,000.Thompson, p. 172 The British, American and Japanese commanders wanted to push on and attack Peking on 13 August, but the Russian commander said he needed another day to prepare and 13 August was devoted to reconnaissance and rest.Daggett, Brig. Gen. A. S. (1903). America in the China Relief Expedition. Kansas City: Hudon-Kimberly Publishing Co. p. 75. ==Objective== The objective of the alliance forces was to fight their way into the city of Peking, make their way to the Legation Quarter and rescue the 900 foreigners besieged there by the Chinese army since 20 June . Peking had formidable defense works. The city was surrounded by walls 21 miles in length and broken by 16 gates (men). The wall around the Inner (Tartar) city was 40 feet tall and 40 feet wide at the top. The wall around the adjoining Outer (Chinese) city was 30 feet high. The population living within the walls was about one million people, although many had fled to escape the Boxers and the fighting between the Chinese army and the foreigners in the Legation Quarter.Thompson, pp. 33-34 As the armies moved into position about five miles from the walls, on the night of 13 August, they could hear the sounds of heavy artillery and machine-gun fire from within the city. They feared they had arrived one day too late to rescue their countrymen.Daggett, p. 77 The relief force did not know that 2,800 destitute Chinese Christians had taken refuge in the Legation Quarter with the foreigners, nor did it know that three miles distant from the Legations a second siege was in progress. The Peitang (Beitang) cathedral of the Roman Catholic Church had been surrounded by Boxers and the Chinese army since 15 June. Defending the Cathedral were 28 foreign priests and nuns, 43 French and Italian soldiers and 3,400 Chinese Catholics. The people sheltering in the Peitang had suffered several hundred killed, mostly from starvation, disease and mines detonated beneath the perimeter walls.Thompson, pp. 115-117 Sixty-six of the 900 foreigners in the Legation Quarter had been killed and 150 wounded during the siege. Casualties among the Chinese Christians were not recorded.Fleming, p. 211 ==Battle== The assault on Peking had taken on the character of a race to see which national army achieved the glory of relieving the Legations.Fleming, p. 200 The commanders of the four national armies agreed that each of them would assault a different gate. The Russians were assigned the most northerly gate, the Tung Chih (Dongzhi); the Japanese had the next gate south, the Chi Hua (Chaoyang); the Americans, the Tung Pein (Dongbien); and the British the most southern, the Sha Wo (Guangqui). The French apparently were left out of the planning. The gate assigned to the Americans was nearest to the Legation Quarter and they seemed to have the best opportunity to reach the legations first. However, the Russians violated the plan, although it is uncertain whether it was intentional or not.Fleming, pp. 201-203 An advance Russian force arrived at the Americans' assigned gate, the Dongbien, about 3:00 a.m. on 14 August. They killed 30 Chinese outside the gate and blasted a hole in the door with artillery. Once inside the gate, however, in the courtyard between the inner and outer doors, they were caught in a murderous crossfire that killed 26 Russian soldiers and wounded 102. The survivors were pinned down for the next several hours.Savage Landor, A. Henry (1901). China and the Allies. 2 Vols. New York: William Heinemann. Vol II. p. 175. Peking in 1900 was surrounded by high walls broken by many gates (men). The location of the foreign armies on the morning of 14 August is shown on the map. The Japanese, Russians and British fought their way into the city through gates. The Americans climbed over the wall. When the Americans arrived at their assigned gate that morning they found the Russians already engaged there and they moved their troops about 200 yards south. Once there, Trumpeter Calvin P. Titus volunteered to climb the 30-foot-tall wall, which he did successfully. Other Americans followed him, and at 11:03 a.m. the American flag was raised on the wall of the Outer city. American troops exchanged fire with Chinese forces on the wall and then climbed down the other side and headed west toward the Legation Quarter in the shadow of the wall of the Inner city.Daggett, pp. 81-82 Meanwhile, the Japanese had encountered stiff resistance at their assigned gate and were subjecting it to an artillery barrage. The British had an easier time of it, approaching and passing through their gate, the Shawo or Guangqui, with virtually no opposition. Both Americans and British were aware that the easiest entry into the Legation Quarter was through the so-called Water Gate, a drainage canal running beneath the wall of the Inner city. The British got there first. They waded through the muck of the canal and into the Legation Quarter and were greeted by a cheering throng of the besieged, all decked out in their \\"Sunday best\\". The Chinese ringing the Legation Quarter fired a few shots, wounding a Belgian woman, and then fled. It was 2:30 p.m on 14 August. The British had not suffered a single casualty all day, except for one man who died of sunstroke.Fleming, pp. 203-208 About 4:30 p.m., the Americans arrived in the Legation Quarter. Their casualties for the day were one killed and nine wounded, plus one badly injured in a fall while climbing the wall. Among the wounded was Smedley Butler who would later become a general and the most famous Marine of his era.Thompson, pp. 178, 181 The Russian, Japanese and French forces entered Peking that evening as Chinese opposition melted away. The Siege of the Legations was over.Fleming, pp. 209-210 ==Aftermath== The next morning, 15 August, Chinese forces probably Dong Fuxiang's Gansu Muslim troops still occupied parts of the wall of the Inner City and the Imperial and Forbidden Cities. Occasional shots were directed toward the foreign troops. General Chaffee, the American commander, ordered his troops to clear the wall and occupy the Imperial City. With assistance from the Russians and French, American artillery blasted its way through a series of walls and gates into the Imperial City, halting the advance at the gates of the Forbidden City. American casualties for the day were seven killed and 29 wounded.Daggett, pp. 95-104 One of those killed was Capt. Henry Joseph Reilly, 54 years old and born in Ireland, a renowned artilleryman.. Retrieved 28 April 2011. The Dowager Empress, Cixi, the emperor and several members of the court fled Peking in the early morning of 15 August, only a few hours before the Americans knocked up against the wall of the Forbidden City. She, dressed as a peasant woman, and the Imperial party slipped out of the city in three wooden carts. Chinese authorities called her flight to Shanxi province a \\"tour of inspection\\". Remaining in Peking to deal with the foreigners, and holed up in the Forbidden City, were trusted aides to the Dowager, including Ronglu, commander of the army and her friend since childhood.Fleming, pp. 232-239\\\\. Ronglu later joined the Dowager on her tour of inspection. At Zhengyang Gate the Muslim Kansu Braves engaged in a fierce battle against the Alliance forces.È©¨Á¶èÁ••--\\"ÊàéÈ©¨‰π¶Áîü\\" - Êñ∞ÂçéÁΩëÁîòËÇÉÈ¢ëÈÅì The commanding Muslim general in the Chinese army, General Ma Fulu, and four cousins of his were killed in while charging against the Alliance forces while a hundred Hui and Dongxiang Muslim troops from his home village in total died in the fighting at Zhengyang. The Battle at Zhengyang was fought against the British. After the battle was over, the Kansu Muslim troops, including General Ma Fuxiang, were among those guarding the Empress Dowager during her flight. The future Muslim General Ma Biao, who led Muslim cavalry to fight against the Japanese in the Second Sino-Japanese War, fought in the Boxer Rebellion under General Ma Haiyan as a private in the Battle of Peking against the foreigners. General Ma Haiyan died of exhaustion after the Imperial Court reached their destination, and his son Ma Qi took over his posts. Ma Fuxing also served under Ma Fulu to guard the Qing Imperial court during the fighting. The Muslim troops were described as \\"the bravest of the brave, the most fanatical of fanatics : and that is why the defence of the Emperor's city had been entrusted to them.\\" The relief of the siege at the Peitang did not take place until 16 August. Japanese troops stumbled across the Cathedral that morning but, without a common language, they and the besieged were both confused. Shortly, however, French troops arrived and marched into the Cathedral to the cheers of the survivors.Thompson, p. 189 On 17 August, the representatives of the foreign powers met and recommended that \\"as the advance of the foreign troops into the Imperial and Forbidden Cities had been obstinately resisted by the Chinese troops\\", the foreign armies should continue to fight until \\"the Chinese armed resistance within the City of Peking and the surrounding country was crushed\\". They also declared \\"that in the crushing of the armed resistance lies the best and only hope of the restoration of peace\\".. Retrieved 3 December 2013. On 28 August, the foreign armies in Peking swelled in numbers by the arrival of soldiers from Germany, Italy and Austria and additional troops from France marched through the Forbidden City to demonstrate symbolically their complete control of Peking. Chinese authorities protested their entry. Foreigners and most Chinese were prohibited from setting foot in the Forbidden City. However, the Chinese gave way when the foreign armies promised not to occupy the Forbidden City but threatened to destroy it if their passage was disputed.Daggett, pp. 106-108 ==Occupation== 14th Infantry Regiment scaling the walls of Peking. The Russians were halted by Chinese opposition in the burning gate portrayed on the right of the picture. Peking was a battered city after the siege. The Boxers had begun the destruction, destroying all Christian churches and homes and starting fires that burned throughout the city. The Chinese artillery aimed at the Legation Quarter and Peitang during the siege had destroyed nearby neighborhoods. Unburied bodies littered the deserted streets.Daggett, p. 111; Smith, Arthur H. (1901). China in Convulsion. 2 Vols. New York: F. H. Revell Co. Vol II, pp. 519-520. The foreign armies divided Peking into districts. Each district was administered by one of the occupying armies. The occupation of Peking became, in the words of an American journalist, \\"the biggest looting expedition since Pizarro\\".Lynch, George (1901). The War of the Civilizations. New York: Longmans, Green & Co. p. 179. Each nationality accused the others of being the worst looters. Missionary Luella Miner said, \\"The conduct of the Russian soldiers is atrocious, the French are not much better, and the Japanese are looting and burning without mercy\\".Preston, Diana (1999). The Boxer Rebellion. New York: Berkley Books. p. 284. The British applied a process to maintain some sort of control. They held \\"loot auctions\\" every afternoon except Sunday at their Legation. The proceeds were then shared out by a prize committee across the troops.\\"Boxers: Looting\\" citing A. A. S Barnes, On Active Service With the Chinese Regiment : A Record of the Operations of the First Chinese Regiment in North China From March to October 1902 ed. rev. & enl ed., (London: Grant Richards, 1902), p139 Nor were the American soldiers free of guilt, although Gen. Chaffee banned looting. \\"Our rule against [looting] is totally ineffectual\\", said an American chaplain.Thompson, 194-196 The civilians and missionaries who had been besieged were some of the most successful looters, as they were familiar with Peking. Some of the looting could be justified. Missionaries such as the Catholic Bishop Favier and American Congregationalist William Scott Ament had hundreds of starving Chinese Christians to care for and needed food and clothing. However, looting for necessities quickly became looting for profit, widely publicized by journalists‚Äîmany indulged in looting on their own while condemning it by others.Thompson, pp. 194-199, 205 The Chinese in Peking also indulged in looting and set up markets to sell the proceeds of their efforts.Chamberlin, Wilbur J. (1903). Ordered to China. New York: F. A. Stokes Co., pp. 83-84\\\\. Chamberlin was the journalist who accused William Scott Ament of looting, thus igniting the Twain-Ament Indemnities Controversy The foreign powers in Peking sent out punitive missions to the countryside to capture or kill suspected Boxers. There was much indiscriminate killing by the foreign troops. American General Chaffee said, \\"It is safe to say that where one real Boxer has been killed since the capture of Peking, fifty harmless coolies or laborers on the farms, including not a few women and children, have been slain.\\"Lynch, George (1901). The War of the Civilizations. London: Longmans, Green. p. 84. Most of the punitive missions were by the French and Germans.Thompson, pp. 198-199, 204 A peace agreement was concluded between the Eight-Nation Alliance and representatives of the Chinese government Li Hung- chang and Prince Ching on 7 September 1901. The treaty required China to pay an indemnity of $335 million (over $4 billion in current dollars) plus interest over a period of 39 years. Also required was the execution or exile of government supporters of the Boxers and the destruction of Chinese forts and other defenses in much of northern China. Ten days after the treaty was signed the foreign armies left Peking, although legation guards would remain there until World War II.Preston, p. 310-311 With the treaty signed the Empress Dowager Cixi returned to Peking from her \\"tour of inspection\\" on 7 January 1902 and the rule of the Qing dynasty over China was restored, albeit much weakened by the defeat it had suffered in the Boxer Rebellion and by the indemnity and stipulations of the peace treaty.Preston, pp. 312-315 The Dowager died in 1908 and the dynasty imploded in 1911. == Legacy == In the Second Sino-Japanese War, when the Japanese asked the Muslim General Ma Hongkui to defect and become head of a Muslim puppet state under the Japanese, Ma responded through Zhou Baihuang, the Ningxia Secretary of the Nationalist Party to remind the Japanese military chief of staff Itagaki Seishiro that many of his relatives fought and died in battle against Eight Nation Alliance forces during the Battle of Peking, including his uncle Ma Fulu, and that Japanese troops made up the majority of the Alliance forces so there would be no cooperation with the Japanese. ‚ÄúÊÅ®‰∏çÂæóÈ¶¨Ë∏èÂÄ≠È¨ºÔºåÁµ¶ÊàëÂ∑≤Ê≠ªÂÖàÁÉàÈõ™‰ªáÔºåËàáÂæåËº©Áà≠ÂÖâ‚Äù„ÄÇ \\"I am eager to stomp on the dwarf devils (A derogatory term for Japanese), I will give vengeance for the already dead martyrs, achieving glory with the younger generation.\\" said by Ma Biao with reference to his service in the Boxer Rebellion where he already fought the Japanese before World War II.http://military.people.com.cn/BIG5/n/2015/0831/c1011-27533214.htmlhttp://military.china.com/history4/62/20150831/20303256_all.html == Pictures == File:Beijing gates broken by russian grenades 1900.gifGates crushed by Russian cannons during the night storming of Peking.

The concept for Mile Sur was developed in 1988 by Lok Seva Sanchar Parishad and promoted by Doordarshan (then India's sole TV broadcaster) and India's Ministry of Information. The song was composed by Ashok Patki and arranged by Louis Banks, with lyrics by Piyush Pandey (then an account manager and presently the executive chairman and creative head of Ogilvy and Mather, India). The project was conceived by Suresh Mallik and Kailash Surendranath, was directed by Surendranath and recorded by people from all walks of life, including a supergroup of Indian celebrities‚Äîmusicians, sports persons, movie stars, etc. The national integration video was intended to instill a sense of pride and promote unity amongst Indians, highlighting India's different linguistic communities and societies‚ÄîIndia's unity in diversity, so to speak. Mile Sur was telecast for the first time on Independence Day, 1988, after the telecast of the Prime Minister's speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort. A recreated version of the song was composed by film musicians Sachin Sanghvi and Jigar Saraiya, rewritten by Saraiya, Vaibhav \\"Vayu\\" Shrivastava and I.P. Singh, and crooned by Sanghvi, Saraiya, Vayu, Singh, Navraj Hans, Shalmali Kholgade, Divya Kumar, Rakesh Maini and Shashwat Singh for the 2020 dance drama Street Dancer 3D, directed by Remo D'Souza and starring Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor in the lead roles. ==Languages used== Hindi (Pandit Bhimsenji and Lataji's parts, among others), and alphabetically the others were: Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Kashmiri, Malayalam, Marathi, Odia, Punjabi, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu.

Prasanna * Others: Dancer Mallika Sarabhai, cartoonist Mario Miranda, filmmaker Mrinal Sen ==Production== It is widely reported that the idea for the song was formed by Rajiv Gandhi and Jaideep Samarth, who was the brother of actresses Tanuja and Nutan and a senior executive at Ogilvy Bensom & Mather (OBM). Samarth approached Suresh Mullick with the proposal made by Doordarshan to create a film on the unity of India with a planned release date of 15 August 1988. Mullick had previously worked with Kailash Surendranath on the successful national integration film of 1985, Torch of Freedom (or Freedom Run), and thus chose him to produce the film. Mullick and Surendranath then approached Pandit Bhimsen Joshi who immediately agreed. Mullick decided to fuse together Carnatic and Hindustani classical music with modern music for the same, choosing Raga Bhairavi as the base (as per Pandit Joshi's suggestion). The lyrics were written by a young Piyush Pandey and were approved after seventeen other drafts were rejected. Mullick chose Louis Banks and P Vaidyanathan to blend the music correctly and arrange the final score, which was sung by M Balamuralikrishna, Pandit Joshi and Lata Mangeshkar. Producer and director Kailash Surendranath filmed the opening sequence with Pandit Bhimsen Joshi at Pambar Falls in Kodaikanal, where Surendranath had previously filmed a famous ad for Liril soap (leading to the falls being known popularly as \\"Liril Falls\\"). With the help of an Air Marshal and an IAF helicopter, he shot the aerial view of the Taj Mahal. This led both Surendranath and the Air Marshal in to trouble. The video also features the Kolkata Metro and the Deccan Queen. Kamal Hassan's cameo was initially unplanned but he was included only because he accompanied M Balamuralikrishna for the shooting at the beach. At the request of Doordarshan, many actors agreed to be a part of the film, with only Naseeruddin Shah declining. While Kavita Krishnamurthy had recorded most of the initial track for the actresses to lip sync, Lata Mangeshkar made time in her schedule at the last minute and recorded the song in the studio, wearing a sari with a pallu () in the colours of the Indian flag. The last shot of the film, featuring school children, was shot at Mullick's alma mater in Shimla. ==Phir Mile Sur Mera Tumhara== Twenty years after the tune's debut, it was re- recorded with an updated cast for telecast on 26 January 2010 by Zoom TV. This version, titled \\"Phir Mile Sur Mera Tumhara\\", features Indian musicians, singers, sportspersons and film personalities from the current generation. The current version's 16 min 17 sec length exceeds the older 6 min 9 sec version and was directed by Kailash Surendranath who had produced the original version as well. The new version retains music composer/arranger Louis Banks. It attracted criticism in a large part of the population among them were the Sindhi community which were upset over the deletion of the Sindhi lines \\"Muhinjo sur tuhinje saan pyara mile jadein, geet asaanjo madhur tarano bane tadein\\" present in the original. Further criticism arose over the omission of notable personalities such as, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Sachin Tendulkar and Viswanathan Anand. It also failed to capture the soul and essence of the original version, focusing excessively on Bollywood actors, ignoring eminent personalities in other fields. The new version featured the following celebrities: * Musicians: A. R. Rahman, Shankar‚ÄìEhsaan‚ÄìLoy, Anoushka Shankar, Shivkumar Sharma, Rahul Sharma, Zakir Hussain, Bhupen Hazarika, Sivamani, L.

Established in 1885, it was for most of its history the main teaching hospital associated with its namesake medical school, Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital, founded in 1848 and named for Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy. Hahnemann University Hospital was fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. Hahnemann University Hospital, located at the southwest corner of Broad and Vine streets, was also affiliated with St. Christopher's Hospital for Children in North Philadelphia. The hospital is owned by American Academic Health System, an affiliate of Paladin Healthcare. The sale of Dallas-based for-profit Tenet Healthcare's remaining Philadelphia assets was completed on January 12, 2018. Under American Academic Health System, Hahnemann's financial condition has worsened with the hospital losing roughly $3 million a month. Joel Freedman, CEO of American Academic Health System, has publicly stated that Hahnemann is on the brink of closure unless there is financial support from Pennsylvania or Drexel University College of Medicine ‚Äî the hospital's academic affiliate. As a way to stem ongoing losses, American Academic Health System laid off hundreds of employees throughout 2018 and 2019, closed outpatient offices and eliminated clinical services. In addition to the hospital's financial turmoil, there has been constant turnover in hospital leadership with the hospital going through five CEOs in the course of a year. On June 26, 2019, American Academic Health announced that because of unsustainable financial losses, Hahnemann Hospital would close in September 2019. The union representing 800 registered nurses who work at Hahnemann, appealed to Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, the Philadelphia City Council, the Pennsylvania legislature, and Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf to keep the hospital open to no avail. On June 27, 2019, Governor Wolf and the Pennsylvania Department of Health issued a cease and desist and ordered Hahnemann to not take any action toward the closure of the hospital until regulators approve a closure plan. On June 29, 2019, Hahnemann withdrew its Level 1 trauma designation. The closure of the hospital resulted in the ACGME displacing 574 physicians who were in training as residents and fellows, which is the largest displacement in United States history. Hahnemann University Hospital logo ==History== 1898 The Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital, founded in 1848 as the Homeopathic Medical College of Pennsylvania, was located on North 15th Street in Philadelphia until 1928. It was the first homeopathic medical college in the United States. After the completion in 1928 of what is now its South Tower, with its art-deco front doors facing Broad Street, Hahnemann moved one block east to its current location. This South Tower was the first skyscraper teaching-hospital in the United States. In 1979 Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital, needing more space, completed construction of the North Tower adjacent to the 1928 South Tower. The North Tower housed Hahnemann's emergency department, trauma center, patient care floors, and other core services. It connects by hallway to the New College Building facing 15th Street. Hahnemann's Charles C. Wolferth Trauma Center, completed in 1986, was Philadelphia's first designated-Level I Trauma Center for adults.Hahnemann University Hospital Trauma Center Hahnemann University Hospital Website The Hahnemann University Hospital campus consists of six buildings: North Tower, South Tower, the Bobst Building, the Feinstein Building, the New College Building, and Klahr Auditorium. In 1993 Allegheny Health Education and Research Foundation purchased Hahnemann Medical College and Hospital. Hahnemann briefly became Allegheny University of the Health Sciences. In 1988 Allegheny purchased the Medical College of Pennsylvania, the former Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania, founded in 1850. In 1993 the schools combined to become MCP Hahnemann University School of Medicine. In 1998 Allegheny Health Education and Research Foundation declared bankruptcy. Tenet Healthcare Corporation acquired its holdings, including MCP Hahnemann University School of Medicine, Hahnemann Hospital, MCP Hospital, and other regional teaching-hospitals associated with MCP Hahnemann, including St. Christopher's Hospital for Children and Warminster Hospital. On August 3, 2000, former US President Gerald R. Ford was admitted to Hahnemann Hospital after suffering minor strokes while attending the 2000 Republican National Convention. He made a quick recovery and was soon released. After divesting or closing all legacy Allegheny Health Education and Research Foundation hospitals, Tenet entered into a definitive agreement to sell its remaining Philadelphia assets ‚Äî Hahnemann and St. Christopher's ‚Äî to American Academic Health System, a newly-formed affiliate of Paladin Healthcare. The definitive agreement was announced in September 2017, with the sale finalized in January 2018. Hahnemann University Hospital announced that it was closing on June 26, 2019 and diverted trauma patients from its emergency room on June 30, 2019. A day later Philadelphia Academic Health System, the hospital's owner, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The hospital stopped delivering babies on July 12, 2019. and closed their emergency room August 16, 2019 https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2019/08/16/hahnemann-university-hospital- emergency-room-closed/ The hospital was part of the bankruptcy of City Center Healthcare. In March 2020, public health authorities attempted to reopen the hospital to provide additional beds during the coronavirus pandemic. At first the facility's owner wanted the city to buy it at market rates. Later he offered to rent it to the city and asked the equivalent of $5.7 million for 6 months upfront. Mayor Jim Kenney accused the owners of \\"trying to make a buck\\" from the emergency. On March 27, after Temple University offered use of the Liacouras Center and other facilities as hospital space at no cost to the city, Mayor Kenney announced that the city was no longer pursuing negotiations with the owners of Hahnemann. ==Services provided== Hahnemann Hospital specialized in: * Kidney and liver transplantation * OB/GYN * Medical and radiation oncology * Hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) program * Minimally invasive robotic surgery * Neonatal intensive care unit, Level III * Bariatric surgery * Bloodless medicine and surgery * Neurology and neurosurgery * Orthopedics * Pulmonary medicine and sleep center * Urology * Bone marrow transplantation * Renal dialysis ==MCP Hahnemann University and Drexel University College of Medicine== The Medical College of Pennsylvania merged with Hahnemann University in 1993, creating four fully accredited schools: the School of Medicine, Graduate School, School of Allied Health Professions, and the School of Continuing Education. In 1993, the college became the first medical school in the country to completely integrate women's health issues into its curriculum instead of an occasional lecture or optional elective. Also in that year MCP and Hahnemann University became part of Allegheny Health Education and Research Foundation and were integrated into the Allegheny University of the Health Sciences, which included facilities in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. However, in 1998, Allegheny Health Education and Research Foundation, which owned eight Philadelphia hospitals, collapsed in the nation's largest bankruptcy of a non-profit health care organization and only bankruptcy of a medical school. In October 1998, in an historic reorganization, the Allegheny Health Education and Research Foundation hospitals were sold to Tenet Healthcare Corporation, a for-profit hospital corporation based in Texas. A new non-profit corporation, Philadelphia Health & Education Corporation (PHEC), was created under the name MCP Hahnemann University. Drexel University was hired as the university's operator. After successfully operating MCP Hahnemann University for three and a half years, the Drexel Board of Trustees unanimously agreed to make its relationship with MCP Hahnemann permanent. On July 1, 2002, two of the MCP Hahnemann schools ‚Äî the College of Nursing and Health Professions and the School of Public Health ‚Äî formally became integrated with Drexel, and PHEC continued to operate as a legal affiliate of Drexel under its new name, Drexel University College of Medicine. Shortly thereafter, the Secretary of Education for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania approved the transfer to Drexel University of all degree- granting authority that had previously been vested in MCP Hahnemann University. As a result, all students of the former MCP Hahnemann University became Drexel students and all alumni became affiliated with Drexel as well. ==Key milestones and achievements== * In 1963, Hahnemann University Hospital performed the Philadelphia region's first kidney transplant * In 1976, physicians at Hahnemann performed one of the region's first bone marrow transplants * In 1986, Hahnemann became the region's first designated Level One adult trauma center and University MedEvac became the region's first air medical program * In 2001, Hahnemann performed the region's first and only artificial heart implant * In 2016, Hahnemann became the first hospital in the region to offer HOPE Act organ transplantation services.

It ran from 1891 until 1954. ==Introduction== On 13 October 1874, the first section of the Palmerston North - Gisborne Line opened between Napier and Hastings. Over the following 17 years the line steadily extended into the Hawkes Bay interior, and on 9 March 1891 it opened through the Manawatu Gorge to Palmerston North. Construction of the Wairarapa Line from Wellington was steadily advancing towards its junction with the Palmerston North - Gisborne Line at Woodville, at the eastern, Hawkes Bay, end of the Manawatu Gorge, but the only rail access to Wellington at the time was via the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company's line (WMR) up the west coast between Wellington and Longburn, just south of Palmerston North. The Railways Department introduced the Napier Express as a dedicated passenger service between Napier and Palmerston North, with connections to the WMR for passengers to Horowhenua, the Kapiti Coast, and Wellington. This was a significant upgrade for passengers on the Napier line, as services had previously just been slow mixed trains, carrying both passengers and freight. ==Operation== The Napier Express commenced just after the railway opened to Palmerston North in 1891 and ran once each way daily, typically hauled by a J class steam locomotive. Despite its 'express' name and superiority over mixed services, it was quite slow by modern standards. The southbound service left Napier at 10.45am and the WMR connection arrived in Wellington at 9.50pm. Today the same journey takes less than half the time. The service was soon to take longer, although the need to change trains was eliminated. On 11 December 1897 the Wairarapa Line reached Woodville, creating a Railways Department line between Wellington and Napier. The Napier Express then was diverted from Palmerston North, running to Wellington via the Wairarapa. This route included the Rimutaka Incline, which caused the journey time to increase by an hour, a move unpopular with passengers. Two Rogers K class locomotives were transferred from the South Island to operate the trains, and in 1899 they were joined by two more South Island locomotives, of the N class, allowing the timetable to be accelerated to 10.5 hours. N class engines were sometimes assisted by M class tank locomotives, and this combination was referred to as the 'en and chicken. In 1908, the WMR was purchased by the government and incorporated into the national network. In 1909 the Napier Express was diverted from the Wairarapa Line, through the Manawatu Gorge to Palmerston North, and then to Wellington over the former WMR track. resulting in a substantial improvement in running time. On 20 February 1911 when the express was approaching Paekakariki from the south, a large boulder dislodged from above on the Paekakariki Escarpment rolled down onto a second class carriage, killing Miss Alice Power (23y) from Greymouth who was travelling with two friends. The Onslow Historian, Volume 13 No 4 1983 p 15 By 1914 the travel time was 9 hours 4 minutes with track improvements in 1914 which allowed the speed limit in some places to be raised to 73 km/h and the more powerful A class locomotives was introduced about 1917-18. By 1925, it was down to 7 hours 31 minutes, partly due to the new AB class locomotives, and a further improvement in 1939 was 7 hours 17 minutes when the Tawa Flat Deviation eliminated the torturous, winding route via Johnsonville into Wellington and the K class began operating the expresses. By 1949 the travel time between Wellington and Napier was seven hours. == Replacement == The Railways Department had been experimenting with railcars for provincial and rural services since 1912, and in the 1930s they started to become successful. In the 1940s they proved popular on other Hawkes Bay services, and due to their greater efficiency and lower running costs the Railways Department began considering replacing the Napier Express with a railcar service. In 1954, due to a severe shortage of crews, and coal, the Express was withdrawn just days before Christmas, and replaced by an RM class Standard railcar service. The railcars were a considerable improvement over the Express, operating twice daily in each direction and covering the journey in just 5.5 hours. The Standard railcars were augmented and replaced by the new, higher capacity RM 88-seater railcars the following year. Carriage expresses returned to the route in 1972 with the introduction of the Endeavour, which was replaced by the Bay Express in 1989. When the Australian company West Coast Railways took over passenger services in 2002, this was one of the services that was withdrawn before sale. ==References Bibliography === * Graham Hutchins. \\"A Year Before the Quake: The Napier Express, 1930.\\" Last Train to Paradise: Journeys from the Golden Age of New Zealand Railways.

He is the first and only Chief of Naval Staff who was relieved from office while still serving and stripped of Admiral rank as punitive measure. == Career and Achievements == He went to School at The Lawrence School, Sanawar on a Govt. of India scholarship for talented children. Vishnu Bhagwat was commissioned into the Indian Navy on 1 January 1960. A graduate of the National Defence Academy, he was awarded the Telescope for the Best All-Round Cadet on the training ship, and the Sword of Honour for the Best All-Round Midshipman of the Fleet. In his 36 years of service he had a vast and varied experience in combat operations, warship production, acquisition and acceptance, personnel management and command. He was actively associated with the 1961 Goa Liberation Operations. He was promoted lieutenant-commander on 1 April 1970. During the 1971 Indo‚ÄìPak war his ship was in the escort groups for missile boats responsible for humbling the adversary. A Specialist in Communication and Electronic Warfare, he was Flag Lt. to Chief of the Naval Staff in 1968‚Äì70 and Naval Assistant to Chief of the Naval Staff in 1986-87. Bhagwat was promoted commander on 1 January 1976. He completed his first major command in INS Amini with the Western Fleet before being assigned as the Fleet Operations Officer of the same Fleet (1978‚Äì79). Promoted to captain on 1 January 1982, he commissioned the third Rajput class guided missile destroyer (DDG), INS Ranjit in September 1983 and was in command for 2¬Ω years during which the ship set new fleet standards/records in weapons, sensors and operations. On promotion to Flag rank as rear admiral on 11 January 1988, he served as additional DG Defence Planning Staff, Chief of Staff of Western Naval Command and commanded the Eastern Fleet. He was promoted vice-admiral on 5 October 1992. He was Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff for two years at the Naval Headquarters. Prior to taking over as the Chief of the Naval staff on 1 October 1996, he was Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief Western Naval Command. In his appointments in Flag rank, Bhagwat made dedicated efforts to enhance self-reliance in defence production and development of indigenous skills and technological know-how. He played a key role in ushering the era of 'computerisation' in the Navy. He was inspired by the rigorous technological approach adopted by United States Navy Admiral Hyman Rickover \\"Father of the Nuclear Navy\\" and Soviet Admiral of the Fleet Sergey Georgiyevich Gorshkov. In an article authored in 2014 he cautioned that relying on an ad hoc decision making process, without a carefully considered overall perspective on the implications of FDI in armament technology, is not a substitute for building a comprehensive plan and robust policy for the country‚Äôs inclusive growth, development and security. An alumnus of the National Defence Academy, Khadakwasla Pune, Defence Services Staff College, Wellington, Tamil Nadu, National Defence CollegeNew Delhi, Bhagwat is a recipient of Ati Vishisht Seva Medal (AVSM) in 1986 and was conferred the Param Vishisht Seva Medal (PVSM) on 26 January 1996. He is an author of a number of papers, articles and has written two well known books, namely An Eye Opening as I Saw and Betrayal of the Armed Forces - The Inside Truth == Dismissal == Vishnu Bhagwat was appointed as chief of naval staff on 30 September 1996 and was relieved from office on 30 December 1998 under Article 310 of the Constitution of India. The unprecedented and much publicised row between the government and the admiral began after the Cabinet appointments committee appointed Vice-Admiral Harinder Singh as deputy chief of the naval staff. Refusing to accept the Cabinet order, Admiral Bhagwat went public with his opposition to the government's decision. The government said that a series of actions from Admiral Bhagwat \\"were in deliberate defiance of the government.\\" The Supreme Court of India later dismissed a petition by the former Navy chief challenging the Government‚Äôs decision to dismiss him from service and the punitive measure to strip him of the title of admiral. == Other controversies == After Bhagwat's dismissal, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader J Jayalalitha, who had offered support to the ruling BJP-led coalition government at the centre, demanded that the former naval chief should be reinstated; Defence Minister George Fernandes should quit or be relieved of his portfolio; and a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe should be ordered. The government rejected her demands. J Jayalalitha met President K R Narayanan on 12 April 1999 and withdrew the 18-MP support to the Bharatiya Janata Party led coalition government. In 2003, Bhagwat reportedly questioned installation of Veer Sarvarkar's portrait in the Central Hall of Parliament of India. This invited the ire of the Shiv Sena, a political party of India. ==Awards and Decorations== { - 105px 105px 105px 105px - 105px 105px 105px 105px - 105px 105px 105px 105px - } {  - Param Vishisht Seva Medal Ati Vishisht Seva Medal General Service Medal Samar Seva Star - Poorvi Star Paschimi Star Raksha Medal Sangram Medal - 25th Anniversary of Independence Medal 30 Years Long Service Medal 20 Years Long Service Medal 9 Years Long Service Medal } == Further reading == * \\"An Admiral's Fall\\" by Wilson John * \\"Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat Sacked or Sunk\\" by Brig R P Singh and Commodore Ranjit Rai. == References == *India Today, Cover Story \\"Sunk\\" *Navy chief Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat sacked *SC dismisses Bhagwat‚Äôs petition == External links == *Mr Mutinous *Voyage of Intrigue *Rediff Interview Admiral Bhagwat *Kuldip Nayar Why was Bhagwat sacked *Rediff Interview Rear Admiral K Raja Menon *Rediff Chat Admiral Bhagwat Category:Chiefs of Naval Staff (India) Category:Deputy Chiefs of Naval Staff (India) Category:Flag Officers Commanding Eastern Fleet Category:Living people Category:Indian Navy admirals Category:Lawrence School, Sanawar alumni Category:Recipients of the Param Vishisht Seva Medal Category:1944 births ","title":"Vishnu Bhagwat"},{"id":"7450068","text":"This is a comparison of chipsets, manufactured by ATI Technologies. ==For AMD processorsComparison of Northbridges=== {  style=\\"font-size: 85%; text-align: center; width: auto;\\" - !

They were descended from Suppo I, who appeared for the first time in 817 as a strong ally of the Emperor Louis the Pious. He and his descendants were on and off dukes of Spoleto, commonly in opposition to the Guideschi clan, another Frankish family powerful in central Italy. ==History== The family consolidated its holdings in northern Italy through the 820s, 830s, and 840s, often controlling the counties of Brescia (hereditarily), Parma, Cremona, and Piacenza among others. Their power was extended and not highly centralised. They shared power with the bishops in the cities and were stoutly loyal to the emperors in order to ensure the peace and stability necessary to rule their vast and separated domains in the Po valley. This loyalty bought them great power, especially in their heartland of Emilia. A Supponid daughter, Engelberga, even married the Emperor Louis II. With her influence, the Supponids became the most powerful noble family in Italy during the two decades of Louis's reign and one of the few to hold high offices. Following Louis's death, the Supponids supported their relatives, the dukes of Friuli, and the German claimants for the Italian crown against the Guideschi dukes of Spoleto and the West Franks. Their influence declined rapidly after they fell out with Berengar I in 913 and joined the faction of Rudolph II of Burgundy in 922. They are not heard of after the middle of the tenth century. ==Prominent members== *Suppo I (d. 824) *Adelchis I (d. c. 834), second son of Suppo I *Suppo II, son of Adelchis I **Boso, Count of Parma **Wifred I, Count of Piacenza *Suppo III (d. 877/879), cousin of Suppo II *Suppo IV *Mauring *Engelberga (d. 896/901), wife of Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor ==Sources== *Wickham, Chris.

His best-known composition \\"Time Is on My Side\\" (written under the pseudonym of Norman Meade) was made famous by The Rolling Stones, although it had been recorded earlier by Kai Winding and Irma Thomas. Ragovoy also wrote \\"Stay With Me\\", which was originally recorded by Lorraine Ellison and made famous by Bette Midler in her film The Rose. It was also performed by Mary J. Blige at the 49th Grammy Awards. He also wrote \\"Piece of My Heart\\" which became a significant hit for Janis Joplin. During the 1960s, Ragovoy \\"helped mould the new African-American sound of soul music\\", according to the obituary in The Guardian. During this venture, he co- wrote the Afro-pop dance song Pata Pata with Miriam Makeba; the song became a major hit for Makeba and was covered by numerous other artists. He was the founder of The Hit Factory.Harry Maslin ==Early life and career== Ragovoy was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of a Hungarian-born Jewish optometrist. He entered record production in 1953 with \\"My Girl Awaits Me\\" by the Castelles. Another well-known song by Ragovoy is \\"Piece of My Heart\\", co- written with Bert Berns and recorded originally by Erma Franklin, and later famously covered by Janis Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company. Between 1966 and 1968, Ragovoy was employed as producer and songwriter for the Warner Bros subsidiary Loma Records. He also co-wrote several songs in Janis Joplin's solo career, including \\"Try (Just a Little Bit Harder)\\" (originally by Lorraine Ellison on Loma Records), \\"Cry Baby\\" (originally by Garnet Mimms and the Enchanters), \\"Get it While You Can\\" (originally by Howard Tate, covered by Joplin) and \\"My Baby\\". Prior to Joplin's death, Ragovoy wrote a song especially for her next album, titled \\"I'm Gonna Rock My Way to Heaven\\". The song was never recorded or performed until shortly before Ragovoy's death in July 2011, when it was included in the theatrical production A Night with Janis Joplin, written and directed by Randy Johnson with arrangements and musical direction by Len Rhodes. Ragovoy was in attendance on opening night when the show premiered at Portland Center Stage on May 27, 2011. ==Later career== Ragovoy also produced recorded work by Bonnie Raitt and Milkwood. However, his involvement in the music industry was less prolific from the 1970s onwards.

However, given the number of ports along the Queensland coast it was realised that additional ships were required. Five ships had already been ordered for the Queensland Department of Harbours and Rivers when the decision was taken to convert them to also serve as auxiliary gunboats. This resulted in the fitting of a 5-inch gun and the relocation of the boilers below the waterline. The ships were as follows: Bonito, Bream, Dolphin, Pumba, and Stingaree. Steam-propelled twin screwed \\"hopper barges\\", these ships were built by Walkers at Maryborough and, at 450 tons, they were the largest warships built in the Australian colonies before Federation. The depression of the 1890s greatly curtailed operations with most of the vessels placed in reserve and being used as training vessels. Stingaree served until 1895 whilst Pumba remained on strength at the time of Federation in 1901, before being sold to Pioneer Gravels (Queensland). She was rebuilt in 1958 and renamed Enterprise, serving as a cargo vessel beyond the late 1970s. Bream (1963), Dolphin (1963) and Stingaree (1966) were sunk off Tangalooma, Moreton Bay. == See also == *List of Queensland Maritime Defence Force ships *Colonial navies of Australia ‚Äì Queensland ==Notes References == * * * Category:Gunboat classes ","title":"Queensland Maritime Defence Force Auxiliary Gunboats"},{"id":"7450172","text":"Tressel may refer to: ==People== * Jim Tressel (born 1952), American football coach * Lee Tressel (1925‚Äì1981), American football coach * A character in the play Richard III * John Tressel (born 1946) American missionary to France ==Other== * Stackton Tressel, a fictional English village == See also == * Tressell (disambiguation) * Trestle, a type of bridge * Trestle table, an item of furniture comprising * Trestles, a surf sport ","title":"Tressel"},{"id":"7450186","text":"Lisa Yuskavage (1962) is an American artist who lives and works in New York City. She is known for her figure paintings, in which seemingly ignoble subjects are depicted with classic, historical techniques. ==Education== Yuskavage was born in 1962 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She attended the Tyler School of Art at Temple University, and studied abroad during her third year through the Tyler School of Art‚Äôs program in Rome, before obtaining her BFA in 1984. Yuskavage received her MFA from the Yale School of Art in 1986. ==Work== Since the early 1990s, Yuskavage has been associated with a re- emergence of the figurative in contemporary painting. Of the artist‚Äôs paintings, critic Roberta Smith has written: \\"The combination of mixed subliminal messages, deliciously artificial color and forthright sexuality is characteristic of Ms. Yuskavage's work, as is the journey from high to low to lower culture within a relatively seamless whole.\\"Roberta Smith, \\"A Painter Who Loads the Gun and Lets the Viewer Fire It.\\" The New York Times, January 12, 2001 Yuskavage‚Äôs oeuvre is characterized by her ongoing engagement with the history of painting, and in particular the genre of the nude. Her paintings also encompass landscape and still life genres, with all three often appear within a single work. Yuskavage‚Äôs unique use of color is imbedded in Renaissance techniques as well as Color Field painting, and she cites diverse inspirations, including Italian painter Giovanni Bellini, Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, and French painter Edgar Degas.Katy Siegel, \\"Blonde Ambition.\\" Artforum, May 2000 Theoretically, her paintings are associated with psychologically driven theories of viewing, such as that of the gaze.Christian Viveros-Faun√©, \\"Cursed Beauty: The Painting of Lisa Yuskavage and the Goosing of the Great Tradition.\\" Lisa Yuskavage (Museuo Tamayo, 2006) However, the complexities inherent in her paintings deny singular interpretation; as curator and critic Christian Viveros-Faun√© explains: \\"Yuskavage‚Äôs oeuvre... succeeds exactly to the degree that it refuses to be pinned down to any one of its many conflicted meanings. 'I only load the gun', [Yuskavage] has been known to say to those who insist on viewing a painting as an explanation.\\" She had a New York exhibit sell out before it opened, and one of her paintings sold at auction for more than $1 million. In September 2015, Lisa Yuskavage: The Brood opened at the Rose Art Museum of Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. This major solo exhibition presented the artist‚Äôs work spanning 25 years. Additionally, Yuskavage is featured in the Metropolitan Museum of Art‚Äôs new online series, The Artist Project, launched in March 2015, in which she discusses √âdouard Vuillard‚Äôs The Green Interior (1891). Lisa Yuskavage is represented by David Zwirner (New York) and by Greengrassi (London). She has had four solo exhibitions at David Zwirner and six solo presentations at Greengrassi. ==In popular culture== Yuskavage's work Half-Family was featured in Season 2, Episode 4 (\\"Lynch Pin\\") of the Emmy-nominated Showtime series, The L Word. Her work is also mentioned in the novel China Rich Girlfriend of the Crazy Rich Asians trilogy by Kevin Kwan. China Rich Girlfriend by Kevin Kwan, p 124 In Tamara Jenkins' 2018 film Private Life, main characters Rachel (Kathryn Hahn) and Richard (Paul Giamatti) claim to be good friends with Yuskavage, whose artwork, gifted to them as a wedding present, hangs in their living room. ==ExhibitionsSolo exhibitions=== *Lisa Yuskavage: Babie Brood: Small Paintings 1985‚Äì2018, David Zwirner, New York (2018) *Lisa Yuskavage: The Brood, Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts (2015) *Lisa Yuskavage, Royal Hibernian Academy, Dublin (2011) *Lisa Yuskavage, Museo Tamayo Arte Contempor√°neo, Mexico City (2006) *Lisa Yuskavage, Royal Academy of Arts, London (2002) *Lisa Yuskavage, Centre d‚ÄôArt Contemporain, Geneva (2001) *Lisa Yuskavage, Institute of Contemporary Art, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia (2000) ==Collections== Museum collections which hold works by the artist include Art Institute of Chicago; Gemeentemuseum, The Hague; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Museum of Modern Art, New York; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. ==Awards== Yuskavage has been the recipient of honors and awards that include the Tiffany Foundation Grant (1996); the Founder's Day Certificate of Honor, Tyler School of the Arts, Philadelphia (2000); and the Temple University Gallery of Success Award, Temple University, Philadelphia (2005). ==Publications== *Lisa Yuskavage: The Brood, Paintings 1991-2015.

Although he studied medicine at the Universidad de Concepci√≥n, Rios abandoned his studies in the early 1930s to devote all his time to creating his cartoons. In 1932 he moved to Santiago to work as a cartoonist at the satirical magazine Topaze.

He also caricatured president Pedro Aguirre Cerda as Don Pedrito. In 1949 Gravett, Paul, \\"1001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die\\", Universe, page 145. he created Condorito, his most famous character, taking the idea from the condor of the Chilean coat of arms. Over the next sixty years Rios contributed cartoons to a great number of publications, including El Ping√ºino, Ganso, Pobre Diablo, Can Can, Pichanga, El Saquero, El Peneca, and branched out into other forms of illustration as well.

Just over 3 million Victorians registered to vote elected 88 members to the Legislative Assembly and, for the first time, 40 members to the Legislative Council under a proportional representation system. The election was conducted by the independent Victorian Electoral Commission. The Labor Party government of Premier Steve Bracks, first elected in 1999, won a third consecutive term with 55 of the 88 lower house seats, down seven from the 62 Labor won in 2002. The Liberal Party opposition of Ted Baillieu won 23 seats, and the National Party led by Peter Ryan won nine seats. One independent member was re-elected, while one lost his seat. Labor lost Bayswater, Evelyn, Ferntree Gully, Hastings, Kilsyth, Morwell and Narracan. In the Legislative Council, Labor won 19 of the 40 seats, the Liberals 15, the Greens three, the Nationals two and the Democratic Labour Party one. This was the first time the DLP had won a seat in the Victorian Parliament since 1955. Steve Bracks became only the second Labor Premier of Victoria to win three elections, and the first to win a third election with a large majority. Despite speculation that he would go on to become the longest- serving Labor Premier in Victoria, he resigned in July 2007 and was replaced by his treasurer John Brumby. ==ResultsLegislative Assembly=== } Maps Image:Victoria20061.gif Image:Victoria20062.gif Image:Victoria20063.gif Image:Victoria20064.gif ===Legislative Council=== } Legislative Council Seats Table {  - !

Eighty-eight members of the Legislative Assembly are elected to four-year terms from single-member electorates. After this election the new Legislative Council consisted of 40 members‚Äîthe five members for each of the eight new regions were elected via proportional representation for four year terms. For decades, lower house districts covering metropolitan Melbourne have always been won by either ALP or Liberal candidates. At the 2002 election, however, the Victorian Greens emerged ahead of the Liberals to challenge Labor for inner-city seats such as Melbourne, Richmond, Brunswick and Northcote. The ALP was strongest, and arguably unchallenged, in most seats north and west of the Yarra River‚ÄîMelbourne's traditional cultural divide. In fact, the Liberals had not held a metropolitan seat in the western suburbs since 1996, when they lost the seat of Essendon. At the 1996 election, the Liberals also lost Ivanhoe (their remaining seat north of the Yarra‚ÄîEltham‚Äîwas lost in 2002). After the 2002 election landslide, the ALP held every Melbourne seat except for a thin band of strong Liberal seats in the eastern suburbs. To win government, the Liberals needed to win back their traditional heartland seats in eastern and south-east Melbourne. For the Liberals and Nationals to win government with a majority of lower house seats, they needed a uniform swing of nearly 8 per cent to gain 20 seats, which would result in them almost doubling their numbers.Paul Strangio, Baillieu has to swim against electoral tide, The Age, 6 November 2006 The ALP's success in 1999 and 2002 was partly due to its success in regional Victoria. To hold onto power, the ALP sought to retain seats outside Melbourne, and to hold its eastern suburban gains in 2002. The Liberals aimed to win back urban fringe seats in eastern Melbourne, such as Gembrook, Hastings and Evelyn, and retain their marginal seats. The Nationals had suffered heavily in recent years from the abolition of country seats they easily won, the rise of independents in Mildura and Gippsland East and direct competition from the Liberals. They aimed to hold on to their seven rural seats and also get members elected to the new upper house. Under the new structure of the Legislative Council, the number of members dropped from 44 to 40 after this election. This introduced considerable competition within all parties for preselection for Legislative Council seats. The switch from provinces electing one member at a time to regions electing five members also meant that the major parties were more likely to lose seats to smaller parties such as the Greens. The balance in the 2002-2006 Legislative Council was ALP 24, Liberals 14, Nationals 4 and 2 independents (both of whom were former ALP members). ===State of the parties=== With a huge majority in the lower house, the Bracks Labor government was expected to be re-elected. The Nationals leader Peter Ryan had terminated the Coalition agreement in mid-2000 after losing Benalla, when it became apparent that the minority Bracks Government would serve out its term. This allowed the Nationals to maintain a distinct profile from the Liberals over the succeeding years, demonstrated during the 2002 Labor landslide when the Nationals won back Benalla. Tensions emerged between the conservative parties over issues such as the Liberal policy of halving tolls on the EastLink freeway. Peter Ryan stated that his party did not back the policy, because it would mean public money was spent on motorists in Melbourne's eastern suburbs, at the expense of services for country Victorians.Liberals, Nationals to consider coalition, The Age, 10 April 2006 The Nationals also took offence at then Liberal leader Robert Doyle's repeated statement that the Liberals only needed 20 seats to win government, a figure which implied the support of the Nationals.Rivalry set to spoil coalition victory plans, \\"The Age\\" - 8 April 2005 During March 2006, Phil Honeywood, the Deputy Opposition Leader, then Victor Perton both announced they would not contest the next election. This contributed to ongoing speculation about Robert Doyle's leadership, during which Ted Baillieu emerged as a possible challenger. Tensions between the Liberal factions were temporarily resolved with the appointment of Louise Asher as deputy opposition leader, with Doyle retaining the leadership unchallenged.A rival-turned-ally rescues Doyle's leadership, The Age, 31 March 2006 Robert Doyle's media director Rob Clancy's resignation became public on 26 April 2006, two weeks after his chief of staff Ron Wilson left for a job in the private sector. The Liberal Party state president Helen Kroger is another Doyle supporter who moved on. This string of resignations raised questions about the strength of Doyle's team in the lead up to the election. In response, Doyle denied that people were leaving because they did not think the party could win the election and that the resignations did not reflect well on the Liberals.Opposition Leader Doyle loses another player, The Age, 26 April 2006 Strong rumours of an imminent \\"forced resignation\\" and Doyle \\"losing the support of the party\\" were aired on the front page of Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper on 4 May 2006. Doyle did indeed resign as both Opposition Leader and MP for Malvern that day, although he stated that the \\"decision was his own\\" Doyle ready to quit, Herald Sun, 4 May 2006 and that \\"his best was not enough to lead the party to victory in a state election just six months away\\".Doyle: my best not enough, The Age, 4 May 2006 On 5 May 2006, it became clear that Ted Baillieu would become Opposition and Liberal Party Leader after former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett and Shadow Minister for Transport Terry Mulder both withdrew from the leadership race. Baillieu was subsequently elected unopposed on 8 May 2006. With declining voter support over the last two Victorian state elections the Nationals almost lost Third Party status in the 2002 State Election. They entered the 2006 election with 11 seats (7 in the Legislative Assembly and 4 in the Legislative Council), the minimum required to for official party status.Victorian Election 2002 , Parliament of Australia Parliamentary Library, Current Issues Brief No 13, 13 February 2003 Several of their Assembly seats were marginal, particularly Shepparton (4.27 percent) and Benalla (1.97 percent). Several commentators predicted that the Nationals would face destruction at this election. The changes to the Legislative Council created large country regions which would negate the personal appeal of several candidates. Upper house member Bill Baxter became the candidate for the lower house electorate of Benambra in an attempt to remain in Parliament. In the absence of a Liberal/National coalition, preference deals between Labor and the Liberals looked set to crush Nationals representation in the Assembly as well.\\"Preference shifts to sideline Nationals\\", The Age, 16 November 2006 Leader Peter Ryan gave what one commentator called \\"the speech of the campaign thus far\\" on 16 November, when he lambasted the major parties for their (perceived) action against the Nationals. The party went on to win an additional two seats.\\"The preferences fallout: Peter Ryan plays 'Survivor of Spring Street'\\", The Age, 16 November 2006 The Greens' Greg Barber, former City of Yarra mayor, won the fourth seat in the upper house region of Northern Metropolitan, where the Greens were considered most likely to win their first seat in the Victorian Parliament. Sue Pennicuik, previously co-covener of the state party, also won the fourth upper house seat Southern Metropolitan region. Colleen Hartland won an upper house seat as well, the fifth seat in the Western Metropolitan Region. Bill Pemberton was preselected as the lead upper house candidate in the Eastern Metropolitan Region but was not elected. In the lower house, Dr Richard Di Natale needed a 2.4 percent swing in the seat of Melbourne to unseat Labor's cabinet minister Bronwyn Pike, but wasn't successful in taking the seat from her, although he came quite close. Gurm Sekhon also wasn't successful in winning a seat, he needed a 3.1 percent swing in the seat of Richmond to unseat Labor's Richard Wynne. The two current independent lower house MPs, Russell Savage (Mildura) and Craig Ingram (Gippsland East) had comfortable margins and were therefore considered highly likely to be re-elected. However, Russell Savage lost his seat to the Nationals, with the planned Nowingi toxic waste dump in the electorate cited as one of the main factors contributing to his defeat.Jacqueline Freegard, Bracks' attack was fatal ~ Savage, Herald Sun, 27 November 2006 The fate of the two independent upper house MPs was less clear. Maverick Labor-turned- independent MLC Dianne Hadden attempted to shift to the lower house and run in Ballarat East against the incumbent Labor MP Geoff Howard, but no polling was carried out as to the potential result. Liberal-turned-independent Andrew Olexander attempted to retain his seat in the Legislative Council, having attempted to build a profile for himself after being expelled from the Liberal Party over disputes stemming from a drink driving conviction. == Polling == Polling conducted by Newspoll and published in The Australian is performed via random telephone number selection in city and country areas. Sampling sizes usually consist of over 1000 electors, with the declared margin of error at ¬±3 percent. { class=\\"toccolours\\" align=\\"left\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin-right: .5em; margin-top: .4em;font-size: 90%;\\" -

Originally, the route ran from its intersection with Fairgreens Road northeast of Jackson to its current northern terminus at what was then known as State Route 75 (now State Route 93) west of Wellston. At the time, the current State Route 788 southwest of Fairgreens Road, and Fairgreens Road heading east from State Route 788, was a part of State Route 124. In 1971, with the completion of a new four-lane expressway around the southeastern portion of Jackson, State Route 124 was re- routed onto this new expressway. Consequently, State Route 788 was extended in that year along the portion of former State Route 124 from the Fairgreens Road intersection southwesterly to State Route 788's current southern terminus at State Route 93 in Jackson. ==Major intersectionsReferences 788 Category:Transportation in Jackson County, Ohio ","title":"Ohio State Route 788"},{"id":"7450380","text":"Beverley Anne Farmer (also known as B.

However, as it also served a relatively low socio-economic area of industrial southeast Christchurch, and promoted sporting achievement alongside academic achievement, the school gained a reputation for being \\"rough\\". Following the introduction of the 1989 Tomorrow's Schools policy, the role declined from about 1500, in 1990, to 775, in 2000. Much of this decline was attributed to the relaxation of school zoning restrictions and the resulting white flight by affluent families within the large south-eastern Christchurch catchment area sending their children to higher decile schools, that had a better academic reputation. In 1975 the school began to take in deaf students from Van Asch College.http://www.linwoodcollege.school.nz/about- linwood/history With the appointment of a new principal, Rob Burrough, in 2000, the school undertook a rebranding exercise, changing the name from High School to College, and, consulting with both students and the community, rethought how it taught students.

He is the most internationally celebrated of 20th-century Ulster painters. ==Early life and education== William Scott was born in Britain on 15 February 1913, in Greenock, Scotland, to Scots-Irish parents, in 1924 his family moved with his mother, Agnes to Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, to join his father in his native town. His father was a housepainter and signwriter, and was killed in an accident in 1927 while trying to save lives in a local fire. William was educated at the Model School and attended night classes in art at the Technical School, taught by Kathleen Bridle. In 1928 he went on to Belfast College of Art, and in 1931 he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy Schools in London. There he won a silver medal and became a Landseer scholar in painting. In London he shared rooms with three Swansea men, the painters Alfred Janes and Mervyn Levy and the poet Dylan Thomas. He was awarded a Leverhulme scholarship in 1935. ==Career== Scott married in 1937, and for the next two years lived abroad, mostly in Italy and in France, where he founded an art school in Pont-Aven, Brittany. However, in 1939 after the declaration of World War II he returned abruptly to Britain. For six months he was in Dublin, where his first son, Robert, was born. During the early years of World War II he helped to run an art school in Bath, Somerset. In 1941 he settled in Hallatrow, High Littleton, Somerset. In July his second son, James, was born in Wells. In 1942 he volunteered for the navy, but was accepted for the army, and after serving with a number of regiments he became attached to the Royal Engineers, with whom he served until 1946 and where he learned lithography in the map-making section. From 1946 until 1956 Scott was senior lecturer in painting at the Bath Academy of Art. In the summer of 1953 he visited the USA where he met Jackson Pollock, Elaine de Kooning, Franz Kline and Mark Rothko. Although his work had become predominantly abstract in 1952, after his meeting with the American Abstract Expressionists., he reverted to his roots in still life and European painting. In 1959-1961 he executed a mural for the Altnagelvin Hospital, Derry. He died at his home near Bath, Somerset in 1989. ==Exhibitions== Scott represented Britain in 1958 at the Venice Biennale. He exhibited at the Hanover Gallery in London, at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York, Italy, Switzerland, West Germany, France, the Kasahara Gallery in Japan, Canada and Australia, at the Dawson Gallery, Dublin, as well as Belfast. Retrospectives of his work were held at the Tate Gallery, London in 1972, in Edinburgh, Dublin and Belfast in 1986, by the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin in 1998 and the Jerwood Gallery in 2013. ==Selected works== *Still Life With Orange Note (1970), Oil on canvas, Arts Council of Northern Ireland collection *Cornish Harbour (1951), Lithograph, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa collection *Fish (1951), Lithograph, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa collection *Portrait of a girl (1948), Lithograph, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa collection *Girl Seated at a Table (1938), formerly owned by David Bowie ==References== * 'William Scott' Norbert Lynton, Thames & Hudson (2003) ==External links== * Official website * * Profile on Royal Academy of Arts Collections Category:20th-century Scottish painters Category:Scottish male painters Category:Artists from Northern Ireland Category:1913 births Category:1989 deaths Category:British still life painters Category:People from Greenock Category:Alumni of Ulster University Category:Royal Academicians ","title":"William Scott (artist)"},{"id":"7450512","text":"Edward Armes Beaumont (15 December 1842 - 17 July 1913) was a vocalist active in Australia.Obituary - Edward Armes Beaumont Obituaries AustraliaKenneth Hince, \\"Beaumont, Edward Armes (1842‚Äì1913)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 3, MUP, 1969, pp. 126‚Äì127 Beaumont was born in St Faith's, Norfolk, England.

It features Mammootty, Mukesh, Rambha, Bhavana, Indraja, Innocent and others. Jyothika was signed as the lead actress but later was replaced by Rambha. The movie was produced by Fazil. The film was a commercial success. It was later remade in Tamil as Engal Anna starring Vijayakanth, Prabhu Deva, Namitha and Vadivelu and in Telugu as Kushi Kushiga with Jagapati Babu. ==Plot== The film opens with a flashback showing the family feud between families of Sathyaprathapan (Mammootty) and Bhavani (Indraja). Sathyaprathapan's sister and Bhavani's cousin are in love. The murder of Bhavani's cousin Vishnu, is wrongly accused on Balagangadharan (Lalu Alex), father of Sathyaprathapan. Sathyaprathapan's sister commits suicide and Sathyaprathapan turns against his father, who too dies soon. He starts to help Bhavani's family and mortgages his own house to finance her factory. A love develops between Sathyaprathapan and Bhavani. But Bhavani's greedy father wants to destroy Sathyaprathapan's family and tries to take their home. That is when Parameshwara Maman (Sathyaprathapan's uncle) shows up, Sathyaprathapan's mom requests Maman to prove Balagangadharan's innocence. Parameshwara Mama and Sathyaprathapan finds Kuruvilla who witnessed the murder being committed by Bhavani's father goons. Meanwhile, we see that Sathyaprathapan's mom faints and dies in the hospital. While in the hospital, his mom tells how Balagangadharan had a different wife and he should ask them forgiveness. He storms into Bhavani's house and accuses her dad, also trying to make her understand the truth but she does not believe him and stands by her father. Then Sathyaprathapan says he does not love her any more and vows that he will never trust a woman by remaining a chronic bachelor forever. Then film comes to the present time showing a legal battle between Sathyaprathapan (now called SP) and Bhavani. Bhavani becomes furious when SP wins the legal battle to get back his house. She threatens to destroy SP. From here, the story moves to the day-to-day life of SP and falls into a comic track throughout the first half. SP is now a successful businessman. SP has a half-sister, Sandhya (Bhavana), who is his father's daughter from the other wife. He now lives for her. But she does not know that SP is her brother, although she stays next door to him. Kuruvilla (Innocent) is SP's aide and he too is a bachelor. Bhama (Rambha) comes to stay in the hostel, near SP's house where Sandhya stays and tries to win the heart of SP. But SP considers her a nuisance. SP agrees to take care of Srikumar (Mukesh). He is the son of Parameshwaran Mama (Janardhanan), who had helped SP to become a successful businessman. Srikumar is a flirt and womanizer. He is now after Sandhya and agrees to stay with SP, when he comes to know Sandhya stays next door to SP. Comical scenes recur throughout the movie, where Kuruvilla, who does not like Srikumar and his friend Ugran (Harisree Ashokan) staying with them, tries to get them out of the house. Bhama comes to know SP is sponsoring Sandhya's studies and confronts him. SP tells her that Sandhya is his sister. Bhama then asks Sandhya to call SP for her birthday party. But SP gets upset and confronts Bhama. Bhama then reveals that her sponsor was SP all the while. During the birthday party, Bhavani comes and takes Bhama away. Then it becomes clear that Bhama is Bhavani's sister. Rivalry arises between Bhama and Bhavani and Bhama runs away from home and promises to help SP, but he tells her he has no hatred at all. Then Bhama's family members come to take her forcefully, but is stopped by Srikumar and SP. That's when SP asks Sandhya to move to his house. Srikumar and Ugran is moved to the guest house. Sandhya finally shows affection to Srikumar. One day SP and Kuruvilla catch Srikumar trying to reach Sandhya through the balcony. That is where SP knows that both of them love each other. And he tells that he knew it all the while and he arranged for everything. He fixes the marriage of Sandhya and Srikumar. He transfers everything he has to Sandhya's name because Srikumar's family thought Sandhya was an orphan. SP tells everything to Parameshwaran Mama's family which is overheard by Sandhya who runs home crying. SP upset runs to comfort her, where he explains how he will live his life as an apology to her mother's curses. But Sandhya tells that her mother loved him and told her to ask forgiveness if she sees him. Now Sandhya and SP re-unite as siblings. During the marriage festivities, Bhavani and her brother Hareendhran (Biju Menon) come to prevent the celebrations. Along with them comes the elder brother of Sandhya, Shekarankutty (Lalu Alex). He challenges SP, saying that he has more right over Sandhya as he is her brother, while SP is just a half-brother. Shekarankutty then claims all of SP's property, which SP is willing to give, provided Sandhya lives happily and marries Srikumar. Bhavani's household members use Shekarankutty to take advantage of SP; first by trying to snatch his company then trying to snatch his home. In the brawl, SP vows that Sandhya will marry Srikumar and he will wipe off everyone who stands in the way. Bhavani then tells SP that Sandhya will be married off to Hareendhran. Shekarankutty supports in the name of revenge. Sandhya, torn between two brothers, comes running when the brothers fight among themselves on the account of who Sandhya will marry. She says she would marry anyone that her brothers tell her too because she cares about both of them. SP then says he know what needs to be done to end the family feud, which should have been long ago. He then marches to Bhavani's house and starts hitting Bhavani's dad thinking of killing him. In the end, SP points at Kuruvilla and says he is the witness of Vishnu's murder. Bhavani's father finally admits that he killed Vishnu and framed it on SP's father. Then SP pours kerosene on Bhavani's dad and as he approach Bhavani, he is stopped by Hareendaran who begs for his sisters life. Bhavani realizes her mistakes and goes to SP's house to apologize. But she tells SP that only thing she can now offer is the marriage proposal of her sister Bhama to SP. SP initially refuses when Srikumar tells that he'll also remain a bachelor if SP does not marry. SP finally agrees and tells him to go inside with Bhama. ==Cast== *Mammootty as Sathyaprathapan (SP) *Mukesh as Sreekumar *Rambha as Bhama *Bhavana as Sandhya *Indraja as Bhavani (Elder sister of Bhama) *Innocent as Kuruvila *Lalu Alex as Balagangadharan and Shekarankutty (Double Role) *Biju Menon as Hareendran (Brother of Bhama and Bhavani) *Janardhanan as Parameshwaran Mama (Sreekumar's Father) *Harisree Ashokan as Ugran (Cousin of Sreekumar) *Mohan Ayeroor as Kunnampurathu Neelakandan *K.

The tour lasted seven shows, starting on March 7, 1996 in Tokyo, Japan, and ending on June 23, 1996 in London, England. == Background and development == The Daydream World Tour was Carey's second tour (after the U.S. Music Box Tour in 1993), and her first tour to have dates out of the United States. The tour was held in honor of the success of her new album at the time, Daydream; the album had spawned three of Carey's nineteen number-one singles (\\"Fantasy\\", \\"One Sweet Day\\", and \\"Always Be My Baby\\"), became her second album to be certified Diamond in the U.S., shipping 10 million copies there and is one of her most critically acclaimed albums. It was also held to promote the album across Europe and Asia. == Stage == The stage set for the tour was perhaps the largest Carey has performed on. It contained three sections: center stage, left flank, and right flank. Center stage contained two platforms where the band and backup singers were situated, a center set of stairs, a curved staircase to the right, a giant screen at the center, a huge chandelier suspended from the ceiling, and a giant cylindrical cage with an elevating platform in the middle for the singer to make her entrance at the start of the show, then moved aside when not needed. The left and right flanks were both the same: they had long runways extending outwards in opposite directions, the walls changed colors throughout the show for ambiance, and at the end were smaller screens so the audience could see Carey performing. == Concert synopsis == The concert began with \\"Daydream Interlude\\" (Fantasy Sweet Dub Mix), with Carey being taken down the cage on the elevating platform. She ad libbed the words to the song quietly over the microphone, and the song stopped when she opened the cage's doors, and the lights flicked on and off rapidly as she greeted the audience. The band then started playing \\"Emotions.\\" The intro to the song was cut in half, and the ending skipped from the last chorus to the famous whistle register notes at the song's end. She then sang her rendition of the Journey classic \\"Open Arms.\\" The next song she performed was her then-single at the time, \\"Forever.\\" She moved over to the set of stairs on the right side of center stage and surprised her fans by singing \\"I Don't Wanna Cry\\", a move most unexpected, since she has stated that she tries to sing the song as rarely as possible. After her song ended, the band continued playing an instrumental version of the song while Carey was offstage, changing costumes for the next section of the concert. Music began playing again combining synths and chimes as an extended version of the intro to the lead single of Daydream, \\"Fantasy.\\" Carey performed the original version of the song, as opposed to singing the Bad Boy Remix of the song as she did during the Butterfly and other later tours. A group of dancers joined Carey during the performance, using the same dance moves seen in the song's music video. She then spoke briefly with the audience, telling them that she wanted them to sing with her during the next song, \\"Always Be My Baby.\\" The part she taught with them was \\"Do Do Doop,\\" and told them that it was a competition between each section of the stadium on who could sing it the loudest. She then presented her band members and exited the stage to change outfits yet again while the band performed the Rufus & Chaka Khan hit \\"Ain't Nobody.\\" The lights dimmed a dark blue and purple color, and on screen appeared stock footage of Boyz II Men from the Fantasy: Mariah Carey at Madison Square Garden concert in October 1995. The band began playing \\"One Sweet Day.\\" Because of schedule conflicts between Carey and Boyz II Men, the group was unable to tour with her, so during the song at all the concerts, Boyz II Men's parts from the album cut were played over the speakers and footage of them appeared on the center screen, while Carey continued to sing live. After the song was over, the curtains fell, and Carey sang her \\"favorite song from the new album,\\" \\"Underneath the Stars,\\" followed by her rendition of the Badfinger song \\"Without You.\\" She was then accompanied by the Chapel of Hope Choir in singing \\"Make It Happen.\\" After the lights went down at the end of the song, she left the stage for yet another costume change. The lights suddenly flickered on, and a R&B;/dance instrumental played, while a dancer appeared and started breakdancing. He was then joined by a group of other dancers, followed by Carey, who began singing a cover of The SOS Band's \\"Just Be Good to Me.\\" She sang \\"Dreamlover\\", and then left the stage for one final costume change. A familiar synth intro started playing, and Carey began singing her first single, \\"Vision of Love\\" as she appeared at the top of the winding staircase. She continued singing as she slowly made her way down the stairs. Once the song was over, she sang her signature song, \\"Hero.\\" The last song of the show, \\"Anytime You Need a Friend\\", she dedicated to the audience. She was accompanied once again by the Chapel of Hope choir, and started off with the album version. She then surprised the audience by transitioning into the more upbeat C&C; Remix version of the song, and she exited the stage via the spiraling staircase, while the choir, band, and dancers continued the song, thus ending the concert. For the Tokyo Dome concerts, following the performance of \\"Anytime You Need a Friend,\\" Carey would return to the stage and perform her biggest Japanese hit, \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\\", as an encore for her fans. Footage of the home video version of the music video played, while she wore the red dress and go-go boots from the black-and-white 1960s music video. She exited the stage through the elevator cage, ending the concert with one last kiss to her fans over the microphone. == Broadcasts and recordings == The performance of \\"Forever\\" at the Tokyo Dome is the official music video for that song. The video took footage from the performance, and is intercut with black-and-white footage of Carey exploring Japan that was handpicked by the singer. Carey announced during the Rotterdam Ahoy concert that the performance of \\"Underneath the Stars\\" was going to be the official music video for the song, but that video never came to fruition. The performances from \\"Fantasy\\", \\"Always Be My Baby\\", \\"Underneath the Stars,\\" \\"Make It Happen\\", \\"Dreamlover\\", \\"Hero\\", and \\"Anytime You Need a Friend\\" from the Tokyo Dome concerts were used in the 1996 Fox special Mariah Carey: New York to Tokyo. Her performance of \\"All I Want for Christmas Is You\\", also from those same concerts, would later be uploaded in high definition onto Carey's VEVO channel on December 3, 2019. The audio of the Tokyo Dome show was released on Mariah's The Rarities album on October 2, 2020, while the Japanese edition also contained a Blu-ray of the show and was also posted on Mariah's official YouTube channel for a limited time.

Each review series contains 12 to 40 authoritative comprehensive review articles, covering the major journal articles on a specific topic during the preceding few years. The major topics in each subject are covered every few years, and special topics appear as appropriate. The reviews are widely used in teaching and research, and serve the purposes both of current awareness and introduction to a new subject. Since in scientific literature it is customary to cite in detail the sources only since the most recent review, these periodicals are among the highest ranking journals in impact factor for their subjects, as shown in the publisher's table.ISI Rankings - Year reports on Impact Factor (This does not imply that they are necessarily the most important journals in the subject; review series always rank highly because of the relatively few articles published each year and the many articles that cite them.) The reviews are written in a compact narrative style, with a minimum of descriptive text for each article covered. Many authors provide lists of summary points and future issues. The length of each review and the number of articles covered vary widely depending on both the topic and the preferences of the author. The articles are written by invitation to the authors, who are accepted authorities on the material covered. == Availability == Each series is available as a bound annual volume, as individual electronic articles purchased online, or as a subscription to the print, online, or both. They are also available as a database consisting of some or all of the series, with site licensing available. The back years of the entire collection can be purchased for a one-time price. Effective January 2008, purchasing a subscription that includes online access entitles you to permanent data rights to that volume regardless of future subscription status. Customers with 2007 online subscriptions will retain access to the volumes that they have previously purchased. In 2017 and 2018, the Annual Review of Public Health was available without subscription; the 2019 volume requires a subscription, but earlier volumes remain open access. ==History== The first series to be published was Annual Review of Biochemistry, which began in 1932. Additional series are started every few years, with the topics appropriate to the growth of scientific research. All Annual Review series became available online in 1996. Since 2004 most series have been richly illustrated in color. In 2017, Annual Reviews launched Knowable Magazine, their first non-academic title, with grants from the Alfred P.

Jacopino del Conte (1510-1598) was an Italian Mannerist painter, active in both Rome and Florence. A native of Florence, Jacopino del Conte was born the same year as another Florentine master Cecchino del Salviati (whom Conte outlived by 35 years) and, like Salviati and a number of other painters, he initially apprenticed with the influential painter and draftsman Andrea del Sarto. Conte's first frescoes, including Annunciation to Zachariah (1536), Preaching of Saint John the Baptist (1538), and Baptism of Christ (1541) were in the Florentine-supported Oratory of San Giovanni Decollato, located in Rome. The Preaching fresco was based on a drawing by Perin del Vaga. In 1547‚Äì48, in collaboration with Siciolante da Sermoneta, Conte completed the fresco decoration of the chapel of San Remigio in San Luigi dei Francesi. In 1552, he painted another work for the San Giovanni Decollato Oratory, the altarpiece Deposition, whose designs are sometimes attributed to Daniele da Volterra.

They struggled greatly again the following season, with a record of 12‚Äì30‚Äì0, but finished second in their division due to the three-team division, and the struggles of the Elk Valley Raiders. The following seasons, the Rockets gradually dropped further in the standings as the East Division expanded, finishing third in 1993‚Äì94, fourth in 1994‚Äì95, and fifth in 1995‚Äì96. The following season, the Rockets improved greatly, finishing second in the newly renamed Eddie Mountain Division, with a record of 22‚Äì18‚Äì1, behind only the Columbia Valley Rockies. The following season, the Rockets dropped to third, with a record of 26-24-0, behind Columbia Valley and the Revelstoke Grizzlies.

The following year the Rockets struggled again, missing the playoffs for a third consecutive year. In 2001‚Äì02, however, the Rockets qualified for the playoffs due to the fact that every team in the Eddie Mountain Division made the playoffs that season, and lost 4‚Äì0 to the Rockies in the first round. They struggled again the following season, finishing dead last, and lost 4‚Äì3 to Columbia Valley in the first round of the playoffs. They did not qualify for the playoffs for the next two seasons, with a combined record of 25‚Äì70‚Äì3‚Äì2 over that time. For the 2005-06 season, the Rockets changed their name to the Golden Xtreme. ===Xtreme, Jets, and Rockets=== The newly renamed Golden Xtreme qualified ended a two-year playoff drought in 2005‚Äì06, but fell in the first round to the Fernie Ghostriders, 4‚Äì3. The following year, the team was bought by a group headed by National Hockey League legend Bobby Hull and renamed the Golden Jets in honour of Hull's nickname. They missed the playoffs, however, and in 2007-08 the team was re-bought by a community organization and the name reverted to the original Rockets. The team would finish with a record of 13‚Äì36‚Äì3, missing the playoffs again. In 2008‚Äì09, the team would improve to third in the Eddie Mountain Division, finishing with a record of 30‚Äì16‚Äì6, but lost to Fernie again in the first round. The following season was similar, with the Rockets finishing fourth in their division, before losing to the Ghostriders again. In 2010‚Äì11, the Rockets would finish third in their division, before losing to the Creston Valley Thunder Cats in the first round. In this season, Rockets player Joshua MacDonald recorded 78 points in 47 games, a team record still standing. In 2011-12, the Rockets would again lose in the first round, to Fernie for the third time in four years. However, in 2012‚Äì13, the Rockets would reach the Conference final, defeating the Kimberley Dynamiters and Fernie Ghostriders en route, before losing to the Castlegar Rebels. However, they failed outright to make the playoffs in 2013‚Äì14, winning only 15 games. They returned to the playoffs the following year, but lost handily in the first round to Fernie again. In 2015‚Äì16, the Golden Rockets recorded their worst season on record, finishing with a record of 5‚Äì43‚Äì1‚Äì3, failing again to make the playoffs. After winning a combined 13 games between 2015-2018, the Rockets made a return to the playoffs in 2018-19, where they would face the Kimberley Dynamiters in the first round. The reigning champion Dynamiters would eliminate the Rockets in the playoffs, advancing to the KIJHL Finals before finally falling to the Revelstoke Grizzlies. Despite the disappointing end, the 2018-19 season was one of the team's most successful seasons in the past decade, and the 38-point turnaround was the biggest year-over-year improvement in the KIJHL that season. ==Season-by-season record== Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against KIJHL.ca, Regular season standings 2013‚Äì2014.

Delegate lies just a few kilometres from the state border between New South Wales and Victoria. At the , Delegate had a population of 351 people. The township of Delegate lies on the Delegate River. ==Location and features== The place name, Delegate, could have derived from an aboriginal word meaning \\"high mountains\\". The first village began in 1852 and was situated at Hayden's Bog on the property now called \\"Bendolba\\". Mount Delegate, or commonly known in the local area as \\"Delegate Hill\\", is situated across the border in Victoria and stands at approximately above sea level. It is the only single mountain in the Great Divide and of an unusual shape. Because of its height, Mount Delegate now has several telecommunication towers servicing vital services to both NSW & Victoria. ==Climate== Owing to its position directly east of the Snowy Mountains themselves, and well-south of the Monaro Rainshadow, Delegate features an oceanic climate (Cfb) typical of the South Coast‚Äîbut a much cooler variant of oceanic due to its elevation (790 m AMSL). ==History== The original owners and inhabitants of this area were the Aboriginal peoples of the Ngarigo Nation. Men from Snowy River Memorial at Delegate. The Delegate area was settled by Europeans in the 1820s when Charles Campbell, youngest son of Robert Campbell of Duntroon, directed that \\"some of the shepherds move their animals towards the areas of the winter snows. They trekked, probably via Cooma, and settled a large number of stock in an area where they formed a new station. This the Campbells called Delegate. the stock spread over a large area and, as there was no other occupant of the district, 34,000 acres were annexed to the occupation of Robert Campbell, who later bought this property. Subsequently, while there were still no other serious competitors in the vicinity, Campbell's stock occupied a further 21,000 acres which came to be called Mt Cooper.\\" p.149.

In 1870 a petition was forwarded to the Council of Education to request educational facilities at Craigie, Corrowong and Delegate. In 1871 Delegate Public School was opened. Today Delegate Public School serves a community of children whose parents are farmers, professional people, those employed by the timber industry and others who work locally. The geographical location of Delegate Public School enables it to draw students from both New South Wales and Victoria. The first place of worship on the Monaro (also known as Maneroo) district was the \\"Deligat\\" chapel. It was a slab building thatched with grass and stood on the bank of Church Creek and was of the Church of England denomination, now known as the Anglican Church of Australia. The site is identified in the Delegate Cemetery and marked by a shelter built during the 1988 Bicentennial Year. In October 1880 St Philip's Anglican Church in Heyden Street was licensed and consecrated in 1885. The Anglican Rectory was dedicated in 1938. In March 1978 the Anglican Parishes of Delegate and Bombala amalgamated to become the Parish of the Southern Monaro. The original Catholic Church in Church Street, the street being appropriately named because of the church, was built in 1877 and in 1915 the present St Joseph's Catholic Church was built on the same site. The Catholic Parish of Delegate also includes St Peter's Corrowong west of Delegate. In 1921 the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart (St Mary (MacKillop) of the Cross Order known as the \\"Brown Josephites\\") opened a school in Delegate which was first conducted in the church building. Sisters Alphonsus Kirton, Rodrigues Miller and Josephine Cahill, Cahill who in later years became Mother General of the Josephite Order, opened the school with 16 boys and 25 girls on the roll. The nuns first lived in Craigie Street on the site of the now Delegate Multi Purpose Service. A house was then purchased in Church Street for the nuns as a convent and an adjacent outbuilding served as the school. In 1943 a new school building was constructed in the church grounds. The Sisters raised their school to make secondary education available to the people of Delegate. With the introduction of the Wyndham Scheme and bus transport the Secondary section closed in 1963. A Presbytery was built for the priest in 1957 however it closed in 1973 and the Convent was then sold and the nuns moved into the Presbytery and hence it became the new St Joseph's Convent. With the low numbers of Sisters to teach and an enrolment of only 33 pupils, St Joseph's Convent School closed in 1981. In November 2015 the Catholic Parish celebrated the 100-year centenary of the present church with a special Mass and dedicated a permanent history display in the former school building to record the history of the parish. The school building was modified with new facilities in 2017 and renamed as St Joseph's School Centre. St Andrew's Presbyterian Church was opened in 1878. The church was built by William Moore and originally had a shingle roof which was replaced by an iron roof in 1912. The original organ was installed in 1901 and the bell in the church grounds was erected in 1905. Families prominent in the church's history are the Campbells, Rankins, Olivers, Sivewrights, Martins and others of Scotch ancestry. As numbers of Presbyterians diminished over the years, the church was sold in 2009. The Delegate Progress Association have taken ownership of the church, and local religious of other denominations now conduct services there to keep it maintained as part of the Delegate Community.Delegate Public School Centenary Booklet 1971 Revised 1996 The local School of Arts building has a museum that displays the history of the area. Honour rolls in the main part of the building record the names of locals who served in both wars as well as a memorial stone at the front of the building commemorating the original Men from Snowy River March in 1916. Like many country halls, it also served as a picture theatre for many years. Delegate was the start for the Men from Snowy Marches during World War I and World War II. In the early 1920s, artist Hilda Rix Nicholas stayed in the Delegate area, where she painted several major works, including In Australia and His Land. She returned and settled in the district with her husband Edgar Wright, and died there in 1961. ==Current facilities== The Delegate Progress Association (DPA) is a vital part of the community and was twice featured on Channel 9 \\"A Current Affair\\". The Association operates from part of the residence of the old bank building built by the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited in 1925. The DPA and the Bundian Way, a project of Eden Local Aboriginal Land Council, have now established a gallery in the old banking chambers. In 2006 after a wait of more than 130 years, the eastern straight-line portion of the NSW and Victorian border was formally recognised at a historical ceremony at Delegate River, just south of Delegate. A crowd of over 300 people gathered at a site known as Allan's Peg on the Bonang Highway for the occasion, with the Governor of Victoria, Mr John Landy, and Governor of NSW, Professor Dame Marie Bashir officiating. The Delegate Show Society at their Annual Show in 2011 launched a book outlining the local history entitled, \\"From 'Dizligit' to 'Delegate' The Journey '\\". ==References Category:Towns in New South Wales Category:Snowy Monaro Regional Council ","title":"Delegate, New South Wales"},{"id":"7450597","text":", is a Japanese classical violist with an extensive career as soloist and chamber musician.

Vines appear in late winter in response to increased rainfall, and can climb or scramble to a length of . Vines emerge from a large, hard tuberous root which can reach several meters in length and weigh in excess of . Vines develop leaves and, particularly, flowers and fruit very quickly, often with the first nodes of the quick-growing vines containing male and female flower heads. Its leaves typically have five lobes with individual plants showing wide variation in leaf size and lobe length. ;Flower The flower can vary in color from yellowish green to cream to white. Flowers appear soon after the vine emerges. The flowers are monoecious, that is, individual flowers are either male or female, but both sexes can be found on the same plant. Male flowers appear in open clusters while females flowers, distinguished by a swollen base, usually appear individually. The plant is self-fertile, i.e. pollen from the male flowers can fertilise the female flowers on the same plant; pollination is by insects. ;Fruit Marah macrocarpa fruit The fruit is longer than it is wide, 5‚Äì6 cm in diameter and 15‚Äì20 cm long, and covered in prickles of variable density, up to 1 cm long but without hooks. Unripe fruit are bright green, ripening to yellow. The fruit swells as it ripens until finally rupturing and releasing the large seeds. Fruit begin to form in late winter and ripen by early summer. ;Seeds and germination Seeds of Marah macrocarpa are large, hard, and very smooth. Southern California manroot has larger, longer seeds than the other manroot species except for Marah horridus. Fruits usually hold four or more seeds. Seeds sprout in the cool wetness of late winter. Seeds have an intriguing germination process. The initial shoot emerges from the seed and grows downward into the earth. This shoot then splits, one part beginning to swell and form the tuber, while the second part grows back to the surface and becomes the vine. ==Taxonomy== Three varieties were formerly recognised: *Marah macrocarpa var. macrocarpas *Marah macrocarpa var. major *Marah macrocarpa var. micrantha ==Distribution== The plant is native to Southern California and Baja California. Its range extends from the Transverse Ranges and Channel Islands through the Peninsular Ranges. It grows by streams, in washes, and on slopes in chaparral and oak woodlands, at elevations up to . It will tolerate a variety of soil types and acidities, but it requires seasonally moist soil. Vines can grow in full-sun to partially shaded conditions. It emerges soon after winter rains begin, grows until late spring, and dies back completely in the heat and dryness of summer. ==Uses== All parts of the plant have a bitter taste (this is the meaning of the genus name Marah, which comes from Hebrew). Despite this, the leaves have been used as a vegetable. The large tuber of the manroot can be processed for a soap- like extract. ==References *UC CalPhotos gallery: Marah macrocarpa Category:Cucurbitoideae Category:Flora of California Category:Flora of Baja California ","title":"Marah macrocarpa"},{"id":"7450606","text":"Ivana Kne≈æeviƒá (–ò–≤–∞–Ω–∞ –ö–Ω–µ–∂–µ–≤–∏—õ) (born 1988) is a Montenegrin beauty queen from the city of Bar, Montenegro.

The technique draws its origins from the work of Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Wheeler at Verulamium (1930‚Äì35), and was later refined by Kathleen Kenyon during her excavations at Jericho (1952‚Äì58). The Wheeler‚ÄìKenyon system involves digging within a series of squares that can vary in size set within a larger grid.

It was believed that this approach allowed more precise stratigraphic observations than earlier \\"horizontal exposure\\" techniques which relied on architectural and ceramic analysis. Arch√§ologie schichtengrabung ==Pros== This method primarily gives archaeologists a grid system to keep better organization of their findings while they dig their squares. These squares also give the archaeologists a very good look into the stratigraphy of the earth as it is uncovered and remains on the balk walls. The main reason to use this method is to more easily distinguish the different layers of earth that would signify and detail the occupational history of the site, which is primarily found in Tells. ==Cons== There are several problems associated with the Wheeler‚ÄìKenyon method. First, this stratigraphic dating technique can only be applied to a site that has formed in identifiable layers; this criterion excludes many sites in North America. It also cannot be used on large-scale projects, and leaves no opportunity for re-excavation by future archaeologists using improved techniques. This method often hides vital walls or important doorways, obstructs earth moving operations, and requires significant effort to remove after they have served their intended purpose.Dever, Lance, et al.

Riddle was born in Burnsville, North Carolina. He grew up with his paternal grandparents near Kingsport, Tennessee, not far from the Virginia border. While working as a young man at a cement plant, he tripped on an auger. The resulting injury entailed the amputation of his right leg at the knee. While he recovered, he took up the guitar, developing an innovative picking and slide technique. Soon, he was collaborating with other musicians from Sullivan and Scott counties, including Steve Tarter, Harry Gay, Brownie McGhee and John Henry Lyons. One time, he met Blind Lemon Jefferson at Tarter's house. In December 1928, Riddle met A.P. Carter, who founded the Carter Family country band. The Carter Family had become known for their recordings at the Bristol Sessions in August 1927. Riddle began to divide his time between Kingsport and the Carter home in Maces Spring, Virginia. Riddle and Carter embarked on song-collecting trips around the region: Riddle would act as a \\"human tape recorder,\\" memorizing the melody while Carter gathered lyrics. The Carter Family went on to record a number of songs that Riddle either composed or transmitted, including \\"Cannonball Blues,\\" \\"Hello Stranger,\\" \\"I Know What It Means To Be Lonesome,\\" \\"Let the Church Roll On,\\" \\"Bear Creek Blues,\\" \\"March Winds Goin' Blow My Blues Away\\" and \\"Lonesome For You.\\" Riddle's guitar technique made an impression on Maybelle Carter, and she incorporated elements of it into her style. In 1937 Riddle got married, and in 1942 moved to Rochester, New York. Soon he retired from music, and in 1945, he sold his guitar, remaining obscure for the next twenty years. In 1965, Mike Seeger, fresh from a collaboration with Maybelle Carter, tracked down Riddle and persuaded him to return to recording music. Over the next 13 years, Riddle and Seeger made a series of studio recordings. Riddle also made appearances at the Smithsonian Folk Festival and the Mariposa Folk Festival. Riddle died in 1979 in Asheville, North Carolina. In 1993, a selection from the sessions with Mike Seeger was released by Rounder Records as Step By Step: Lesley Riddle Meets The Carter Family: Blues, Country & Sacred Songs. On July 31, 2009, a stage production about Riddle's life, including his time with and influence on the Carter Family, had its world premier at the Parkway Playhouse in Burnsville, North Carolina, Riddle's birthplace. The show featured biographical details of his life, plus versions of songs as he played them, and then again as the Carters played them. The production was called Esley: The Life and Music of Lesley Riddle, written by Jeff Douglas Messer, directed by Michael Lilly, and starring Jim Arrendell as Esley. In mid-2015, Parkway Playhouse revived the stage production of Esley with a new cast of actors, but still under the direction of Michael Lilly. Playwright Jeff Douglas Messer is currently working on a screenplay and novel based on the stage script. ==References * Biography at UNCA * Biography at the Birthplace of Country Music Alliance Category:1905 births Category:1979 deaths Category:People from Burnsville, North Carolina Category:American male singer- songwriters Category:American country singer-songwriters Category:African- American musicians Category:20th-century American singers Category:African- American country musicians Category:Country musicians from North Carolina Category:20th-century male singers ","title":"Lesley Riddle"},{"id":"7450662","text":"Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi (Œ£ŒëŒïŒ†) is a national Jewish sorority. It was founded on October 1, 1998 at the University of California, Davis. ==Formation== In the early 1990s with the closing of a national Jewish sorority, the University of California, Davis was left without a Jewish women's social organization. Several women on campus noticed the gap left by the absence of the former sorority and began strategizing how to start an organization on campus that would fill the need. Members of Alpha Epsilon Pi, a national Jewish fraternity, also urged the women of Davis to start a Jewish women's social organization of their own. With positive response from the campus Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi was formed. The \\"Sigma\\" is meant to represent \\"sisters of\\" in honor of Alpha Epsilon Pi's contributions towards the formation of the sorority. Sigma is also the 18th letter of the Greek alphabet; in Jewish tradition, the number 18 means chai (life). The six women who founded the sorority‚ÄîAlycia Seaman, Erin Glick, Leah Dansker, Rachel Rothfarb, Erin Barker, and Dana Miller‚Äîare considered the eternal mothers of the sorority.SAEPi national website, accessed 1 Jul 2020. Despite being a Jewish sorority there is no discrimination based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, or handicap. ==Mission, Vision, and Values== Mission: \\"The purpose of this organization is to promote unity, support, and a Jewish awareness, as well as to provide a Jewish experience for ourselves, our members, and the community as a whole. This organization is devoted to friendship, motivation, opportunity, leadership, and well-being.\\" Vision: \\"Our vision is to provide a Jewish environment for collegiate women to grow as individuals and leaders.\\" Values: Unity, Trust, Strength, Sincere Sisterhood, and Exemplifying Jewish Values. These values define the sorority as a community. Members, individually and collectively, aim to live these values both in and out of the context of the organization. ==Traditions== SAEPi's publication is called The Iris Petal, with a quarterly publication schedule. The sorority's mascot is the Lioness, representing \\"strength, power and force.\\" The sorority's flower is the Blue Iris. From the Iris, its colors were chosen: Blue and Gold. They are explained as such: \\"Blue is prominent in Judaism, and gold symbolizes the richness SAEPi brings to its members.\\" Additionally, these colors are used to identify the University of California, where the sorority was founded. The sorority's gemstone is the sapphire.As noted in the Quick Facts section of SigmaAEPi's website, accessed 1 Jul 2020. ==Sorority Life== The first season of MTV‚Äôs Sorority Life was filmed in the spring of 2002 on the UC Davis campus featuring members and pledges of Œ£ŒëŒïŒ†.

Currently, there are seven alumnae from different chapters voluntarily serving as the directors on the National Board. In early 2017, the National Board voted to restructure in order to consolidate operational functions into the Executive Office, maintaining the National Board for governance, strategic planning, and oversight. 2019-2021 National Board members are: *Past President: Adi Hanein (Charter) *President: Dawn Savage (Mu) *President-Elect: Emmy Bajayo (Lambda) *Secretary: Rachel Allen (Mu) *Treasurer: Deborah Joseph Friedman (Eta) *Regional Governor - West: Amy McElroy (Charter) *Regional Governor - East: Deena Abramson (Xi) *Executive Director: Chayla Furlong (Delta) ==National Philanthropy== At the 2008 national convention, Cancer Schmancer was selected as the sorority's national philanthropy. In 2011 the National Board re-evaluated the national philanthropy and decided to move on to an organization that encompasses all of the philosophies of Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi. American Jewish World Service was chosen. In addition to the national philanthropy, some chapters also support local philanthropies. ==Chapter listReferences Category:1998 establishments in California Category:Student societies in the United States Category:Historically Jewish fraternities and sororities in the United States Category:Fraternities and sororities in the United States Category:Student organizations established in 1998 ","title":"Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi"},{"id":"7450664","text":"Liston Bryan Ramsey (February 26, 1919 ‚Äì September 2, 2001) was an American politician. A member of the North Carolina House of Representatives for nearly four decades, he held great influence in state government served as Speaker of the House from 1981 until 1989. == Early life == Liston Bryan Ramsey was born on February 26, 1919 to John Morgan Ramsey and Della Lee Bryan in Marshall, North Carolina, United States. He was the valedictorian of his senior class at Marshall High School in 1936, and two years later he earned an associate's degree from Mars Hill College, then a junior college located in his native Madison County (in 1988, Mars Hill College would award him an honorary doctorate degree). During the Second World War, Ramsey served as a sergeant in the U.S. Army Air Corps in the Pacific Theater of the war. After the war, Ramsey was elected to serve on the town board of aldermen for Marshall, North Carolina. == Political career == From 1958 to 1960 and in 1962 Ramsey served as chairman of the Madison County Democratic Executive Committee. In 1960, running as a Democrat, Ramsey was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives. In 1964 Ramsey, a staunch ally of Zeno and E. Y. Ponder‚Äîthe leaders of a political machine based in Madison County, lost his bid for reelection to his seat in the North Carolina House of Representatives to a Republican, F. Crafton Ramsey. The Ponders thus had no direct representation in state government, but Zeno dispatched Liston Ramsey to Raleigh, the state capital, anyway to take up residence while the North Carolina General Assembly was in session. Ramsey quickly formed a bloc with fellow Democrats from mountain counties, including Representatives Mark Bennet and J. Thurston Arledge, to represent his concerns in state government. The group worked together to prevent changes to state procedure for jury selection that would allow for bipartisan input, as the under the existing system jury selection in Madison County was controlled by a single Democratic official. Ramsey regained his seat in the state legislature in 1966 and became one of its most influential members. In 1981 he was elected Speaker of the House and would spend four terms in that post; he was the first legislator in North Carolina history to hold the Speaker's office for four terms (a record tenure matched only by James B. Black). During his tenure as Speaker, he worked to transfer state funds to the often-neglected western mountain counties of North Carolina, building roads and other public facilities that would not have existed otherwise. A major accomplishment of his time as Speaker was the creation of the Liston B. Ramsey Activity Center at Western Carolina University. The Center, opened in 1986, features facilities for basketball, volleyball, and other sports, as well as sponsoring cultural activities on the Western Carolina campus. In January 1989, Ramsey was ousted as Speaker of the House when Republican Governor James G. Martin secretly joined his party's forces with 20 Democratic state representatives led by Joe Mavretic. These Democrats, who represented North Carolina's larger cities, had grown resentful of what they regarded as Ramsey's autocratic control of the legislature, and of his tendency to support representatives from small, rural counties over those from more urbanized areas. Ramsey's adversaries derisively nicknamed him \\"Boss Hogg,\\" after the corrupt, old-time political boss in the popular 1970s TV series The Dukes of Hazard. These twenty Democrats joined with the 46 Republicans in the State House to elect Mavretic as Speaker over Ramsey. Even after this surprise defeat, however, Ramsey continued to be an influential voice in the legislature. He voluntarily retired from the legislature in 1999, and died in 2001. In 2002, Mars Hill College opened the Ramsey Center for Regional Studies. The Center houses Ramsey's official papers from his years in public office, and is dedicated to preserving the heritage and culture of the people of the Southern Appalachian Mountains. A section of Interstate 26 running between Asheville, North Carolina and Johnson City, Tennessee is also named in his honor. ==References== * *Ramsey Center Namesake Dies - Article from the \\"Western Carolinian\\" == Works cited == * Category:1919 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Mars Hill University alumni Category:Members of the North Carolina House of Representatives Category:People from Marshall, North Carolina Category:Speakers of the North Carolina House of Representatives Category:United States Army Air Forces personnel of World War II Category:North Carolina Democrats Category:20th-century American politicians Category:United States Army Air Forces soldiers ","title":"Liston B.

In Malayalam, she rechristened herself as Meenakshi, the character she played in Kakkakarumbam. ==Early life== Meenakshi was born and raised in Kozhencherry, Pathanamthitta district. Growing up in Kozhencherry, Sharmily knows Hindi, English, Malayalam and Tamil. The people in Kozhencherry are known to be bilingual as they can speak both Tamil and English in addition to their native language, Malayalam. But Meenakshi left for Chennai to pursue higher studies. Meenakshi graduated in Maths from the Stella Maris College, Chennai. and received a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) in India. While in school, she received several acting offers, which she rejected so that she could concentrate on her studies. She did modelling and later hosted a popular phone-in programme, Kasumele on Jaya TV. People were instantly attracted by her cheerful and youthful approach to anchoring. After graduation, she agreed to appear in the Tamil film Aasai Aasaiyai. She followed that role with a Telugu film, Tarak, before returning to Tamil with Anbe Anbe, in which she starred alongside Shaam. ==Career== Her debut Tamil movie was Aasai Aasaiyai in 2003 with Jiiva, who also made his debut with this film. This movie was not very well received in the box office even though the story and Sharmeelee's acting got good reviews from critics. This was then followed by Anbe Anbe with Shaam was classified as a medium hit in the box office. Her third Tamil movie was Diwan with Sarathkumar. This movie won her rave reviews for her performance. It was followed by her Telugu entry through the movie Tarak in 2003. In 2004, she made her debut in Malayalam Industry with two movies - Vellinakshatram and Kaakkakarumban. Her first movie Vellinakshatram was a mega hit and her performance was appreciated by many. After that she established herself in Malayalam movies with a string of hit movies. The same year, Youth festival and Black(cameo appearance) were also released. Later however, she failed to sustain in Malayalam film industry and tried her luck in other regional languages. In 2005, she appeared in the movie Junior Senior, where she acted aside Mukesh and Kunchacko Boban. This movie was a remake of Hindi classic hit, Yes Boss, where Meenakshi reprised the role played by Juhi Chawla. Same year, Ponmudipuzhayorathu was also released.

It was first introduced in the ATA-4 standard CXV (T13) in 2001. ==How it works== Creation of an HPA. The diagram shows how a host protected area (HPA) is created. The IDE controller has registers that contain data that can be queried using ATA commands. The data returned gives information about the drive attached to the controller. There are three ATA commands involved in creating and using a host protected area. The commands are: * IDENTIFY DEVICE * SET MAX ADDRESS * READ NATIVE MAX ADDRESS Operating systems use the IDENTIFY DEVICE command to find out the addressable space of a hard drive. The IDENTIFY DEVICE command queries a particular register on the IDE controller to establish the size of a drive. This register however can be changed using the SET MAX ADDRESS ATA command. If the value in the register is set to less than the actual hard drive size then effectively a host protected area is created. It is protected because the OS will work with only the value in the register that is returned by the IDENTIFY DEVICE command and thus will normally be unable to address the parts of the drive that lie within the HPA. The HPA is useful only if other software or firmware (e.g. BIOS) is able to use it. Software and firmware that are able to use the HPA are referred to as 'HPA aware'. The ATA command that these entities use is called READ NATIVE MAX ADDRESS. This command accesses a register that contains the true size of the hard drive. To use the area, the controlling HPA-aware program changes the value of the register read by IDENTIFY DEVICE to that found in the register read by READ NATIVE MAX ADDRESS. When its operations are complete, the register read by IDENTIFY DEVICE is returned to its original fake value. == Use == * At the time HPA was first implemented on hard-disk firmware, some BIOS had difficulty booting with large hard disks. An initial HPA could then be set (by some jumpers on the hard disk) to limit the number of cylinder to 4095 or 4096 so that older BIOS would start. It was then the job of the bootloader to reset the HPA so that the operating system would see the full hard-disk storage space. * HPA can be used by various booting and diagnostic utilities, normally in conjunction with the BIOS. An example of this implementation is the Phoenix FirstBIOS, which uses Boot Engineering Extension Record (BEER) and Protected Area Run Time Interface Extension Services (PARTIES).Blunden, Bill. The Rootkit Arsenal: Escape and Evasion in the Dark Corners of the System. 1st ed. Jones & Bartlett Publishers, 2009 p.538 Another example is the Gujin installer which can install the bootloader in BEER, naming that pseudo-partition /dev/hda0 or /dev/sdb0; then only cold boots (from power-down) will succeed because warm boots (from Control-Alt-Delete) will not be able to read the HPA. * Computer manufacturers may use the area to contain a preloaded OS for install and recovery purposes (instead of providing DVD or CD media). * Dell notebooks hide Dell MediaDirect utility in HPA. IBM ThinkPad and LG notebooks hide system restore software in HPA. * HPA is also used by various theft recovery and monitoring service vendors. For example, the laptop security firm Computrace use the HPA to load software that reports to their servers whenever the machine is booted on a network. HPA is useful to them because even when a stolen laptop has its hard drive formatted the HPA remains untouched. * HPA can also be used to store data that is deemed illegal and is thus of interest to government and police computer forensics teams. * Some vendor-specific external drive enclosures (e.g. Maxtor, owned by Seagate since 2006) are known to use HPA to limit the capacity of unknown replacement hard drives installed into the enclosure. When this occurs, the drive may appear to be limited in size (e.g. 128 GB), which can look like a BIOS or dynamic drive overlay (DDO) problem. In this case, one must use software utilities (see below) that use READ NATIVE MAX ADDRESS and SET MAX ADDRESS to change the drive's reported size back to its native size, and avoid using the external enclosure again with the affected drive. * Some rootkits hide in the HPA to avoid being detected by anti-rootkit and antivirus software. * Some NSA exploits use the HPAhttps://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/02/swap_nsa_exploi.html for application persistence. == Identification and manipulation == Identification of HPA on a hard drive can be achieved by a number of tools and methods. Note that the HPA feature can be hidden by DCO commands (documentation states only if the HPA is not in use), and can be \\"frozen\\" (until next power-down of the hard disk) or be password protected. ===Identification tools=== * ATATool by Data Synergy * The Sleuth Kit (free, open software) by Brian Carrier (HPA identification is currently Linux-only.) * EnCase by Guidance Software * Forensic Toolkit by Access Data ===Identification methods=== The Windows program ATATool can detect an HPA. For instance, to see if the first disk has an HPA use the command: ATATOOL /INFO \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.\\\\PhysicalDrive0 Using Linux, there are various ways to detect the existence of an HPA. Recent versions of Linux will print a message when the system is booting if an HPA is detected. For example: dmesg  less [...] hdb: Host Protected Area detected. current capacity is 12000 sectors (6 MB) native capacity is 120103200 sectors (61492 MB) The program hdparm (versions 8.0 and above) will detect an HPA on drive sdX when invoked with these parameters: hdparm -N /dev/sdX For versions of hdparm below 8, one can compare the number of sectors output from 'hdparm -I' with the number of sectors reported for the hard drive model's published statistics. ===Manipulation methods=== The Windows program ATATool can be used to create a HPA.

Portsmouth play their home games at Fratton Park, while Southampton play theirs at St. Mary's Stadium. Portsmouth and Southampton are the most successful clubs on the southern coast of England, , and lie only 19 miles (31 km) apart in Hampshire. However, because the two clubs have often been in different divisions, the derby game has only been played 71 times in \\"First Class\\" competition since the first one in 1899. Portsmouth have won the most titles of the pair, being champions of England twice (1948‚Äì49 and 1949‚Äì50) and twice FA Cup winners (1939 and 2008), whilst Southampton have only won a single FA Cup (1976). In \\"first class\\" matches between the two teams, Southampton have the most wins, and have been more regularly in a higher league than Portsmouth, including their 27 consecutive years in the top flight of English football. In the 2019‚Äì20 season, Southampton play in the Premier League and Portsmouth are in League One. == Changing fortunes == Southampton were originally formed in 1885 as St. Mary's Young Men's Association F.C., before adopting the name Southampton St. Mary's when the club joined the Southern League in 1894. After they won the Southern League title in 1896‚Äì97, the club became a limited company and changed their name to Southampton F.C. Portsmouth was founded in April 1898 and joined the Southern League in 1899. The first match between the two clubs came in a friendly at Portsmouth's Fratton Park ground on 6 September 1899. The match was won \\"on their merits\\" 2‚Äì0 by Portsmouth, with goals from Dan Cunliffe (formerly with Liverpool) and Harold Clarke (formerly with Everton). Southampton and Portsmouth first played each other in the Southern League in April 1900, with Portsmouth winning 2‚Äì0 twice in three days. The teams met regularly in the Southern League, and in the early years of the 20th century were rivals for the league title, with Southampton taking the title in 1901, 1903 and 1904 (having also been champions in three consecutive seasons from 1896‚Äì97 to 1898‚Äì99, before Portsmouth were formed) and Portsmouth taking the title in 1902 (and again in 1920). The first of four South Coast derbies in the FA Cup took place on 13 January 1906. Because of the large crowd expected for the first FA Cup meeting between the two rivals, the local registrars in both towns postponed voting in the 1906 general election until the following week. The match at The Dell was attended by a capacity crowd of 14,000 and the Portsmouth fans, together with their players, did their best to unsettle the inexperienced 'keeper, Bill Stead, who was making only his second first team appearance. Stead, however, showed few signs of nerves and produced a \\"phlegmatic performance\\", restricting Portsmouth to a single goal from Dan Cunliffe, while the Saints scored five and eventually progressed to the last eight, where they lost 3‚Äì0 at Liverpool. For the 1920‚Äì21 season, both teams were admitted to the Football League (together with the majority of the Southern League First Division sides). The first Football League game between the two clubs was on 11 September 1920, with Southampton winning 2‚Äì0. After two seasons in the Third Division, Saints were promoted as champions in 1922. Pompey joined them in the Second Division in 1924 and were promoted to the First Division in 1927. Up to this time the teams had met ten times in the Football League, with Saints winning four, Pompey three and three draws. From 1927 until 1960 Portsmouth enjoyed a much-superior league position to their neighbours, winning the FA Cup in 1939 and back-to-back League Titles in 1948‚Äì49 and 1949‚Äì50, until 1960, when Southampton gained promotion back to the Second Division, Portsmouth having been relegated from the First Division the previous season. From the 1960s onwards, Southampton found themselves in the ascendancy, being in a superior division nearly every season while defeating their rivals whenever the two sides met in cup clashes. With Southampton being in a higher division for most of the period from the 1960s through to the early 2000s, the two clubs rarely met. Events such as the death of Portsmouth goalkeeper Aaron Flahavan, a Southampton-born footballer whose brother Darryl had played for Southampton, occasionally brought the fans together. However, events of recent years have altered this markedly. Southampton dominated the South Coast derby games in the post-war era, with 14 wins against Portsmouth's 6. Portsmouth's promotion to the Premiership in 2003 evened matters and reignited the clubs' rivalry ‚Äì the first time the two teams had met in regular league competition since the 1987‚Äì88 First Division season. Southampton held the upper-hand, winning two of the three matches played between the two sides in the 2003‚Äì04 season to Portsmouth's one. The rivalry was galvanised with the appointment of Harry Redknapp as Southampton manager in December 2004, just days after he had resigned as manager of Portsmouth, and less than a month after the Saints had beaten Portsmouth at St Mary's Stadium. The following month, the Saints were drawn against and defeated their rivals in a fiery FA Cup match, with former Portsmouth striker Peter Crouch (who would go on to rejoin Portsmouth in 2008) scoring the decisive penalty in the last minute of the match. However, Portsmouth struck back in the next league encounter between the rivals, with Southampton beaten 4‚Äì1 at Fratton Park by their relegation rivals in Redknapp's only return to the ground with the club. Southampton were subsequently relegated from the Premiership a few games later on the final day of the 2004‚Äì05 season, ending their 27-year run in the top flight of English Football. Harry Redknapp caused more controversy when he left Southampton and returned to Portsmouth and enjoyed success. Portsmouth won the FA Cup again in 2008 under Redknapp whilst, in 2009, Southampton were again relegated, this time to League One. The two sides met in a fierce FA Cup match at St Mary's in 2010 which Portsmouth came out 4‚Äì1 victors again and went on to reach the FA Cup final that season but did not perform too well in the league. Portsmouth were in turn relegated to the Championship for the 2010‚Äì11 season after having been deducted nine points as a penalty for entering administration. The matches played during the 2011‚Äì12 season both ended as draws, but the club's fortunes differed considerably with Southampton gaining promotion to the Premier League and Portsmouth once again going into administration and being relegated to League One. In Portsmouth's absence, AFC Bournemouth and Brighton and Hove Albion ‚Äì based about and from Southampton respectively ‚Äì gained promotion to the Premier League, with some media outlets marketing fixtures against them as a 'South Coast derby';AFC Bournemouth: What should we call the derby between Cherries and Southampton?, Bournemouth Daily Echo, 30 October 2015Southampton snatch equaliser against Brighton in the south coast derby but remain in the relegation zone, The Independent, 31 January 2018Bournemouth against Southampton the ‚Äúother‚Äù South Coast Derby, Vital Football, 18 October 2018 however, there is very little shared history or animosity between the clubs and supporters have never acknowledged these as significant rivalries,Southampton v Brighton: A 'derby' fans don't care about, Brighton and Hove Independent, 18 August 2018Bournemouth end long wait for a win at Southampton, Belfast Telegraph, 20 September 2019 something which was emphasised in September 2019 when Southampton were drawn against Portsmouth in the EFL Cup for their first meeting in seven years, with the event being discussed with much more anticipation than Saints' league matches against both Bournemouth and Brighton a few weeks earlier.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49378896Southampton 1-3 Bournemouth (\\"Next up for Southampton is the 'proper' South Coast derby, at Portsmouth in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday\\"), BBC Sport, 20 September 2019 == Harry Redknapp == The acrimonious departure of Harry Redknapp from Portsmouth to Southampton brought the bitter rivalry between the two clubs to a new level. When Redknapp returned to Portsmouth in November 2005 following Southampton's relegation, it only served to further sour relations between the two clubs, which arguably remain at an all-time low. The two clubs' chairmen at the time, Rupert Lowe (Southampton) and Milan Mandariƒá (Portsmouth), publicly criticised one another on a number of occasions, with Lowe calling for an inquest into irregular betting patterns in the run-up to Redknapp's re- appointment. Mandariƒá had even sent a boxed duck as a Christmas \\"gift\\" to Lowe (as Lowe had been on a hunting trip when the \\"ordeal\\" began), but the gesture only furthered the animosity between the two. ==Inter-fan rivalry== Exactly when the fierce rivalry between the supporters of the two clubs began is not entirely clear. Until as recently as the early 1970s, many fans would go and watch the other team when their side was playing away, indicating anything but hatred. Some ascribe the growing rivalry since then to the cities' diverging economic fortunes. But in 1976, there were changes in fortune for both cities and their football clubs. Portsmouth International Port was built next to the new M275 motorway spur, both opening in 1976. This was seen as threat to the Port of Southampton by its dockers. Portsmouth FC, on a decline, lost a fifth consecutive derby match against Southampton in a period from 1966 to 1976. Southampton FC, in Division Two were on the rise and won a shock victory in the 1976 FA Cup Final, against Division One team Manchester United 1-0 at Wembley Stadium. The goal was scored by Portsmouth-born Bobby Stokes. Southampton were promoted to Division One in 1978. Meanwhile, Portsmouth plummeted to Division Four in the same period. Jealously, bragging, changing fortunes between the opposing fans, and the rise of football hooliganism in 1970s England are most likely the cause of the bitter rivalry that now exists between both sets of supporters. In the early 1980s, cross-channel ferry services then moved from Southampton to Portsmouth International Port. Portsmouth's closer proximity to the European continent saved fuel, journey time and made more economic sense to ferry operators. Portsmouth's closer distance to London by road and rail was also seen as a positive by European visitors. In the 1987-88 Division One season, Portsmouth and Southampton both met in the top division of English football for the first time in their shared histories. This was the first season that Southampton fans began using the derogatory Skate nickname for Portsmouth's supporters, which had been chosen from a fanzine poll. Despite a 2-2 home draw at Fratton Park, and a 0-2 away win at The Dell, Southampton, Portsmouth were eventually relegated back to Division Two after only one season. In the early 2000s, Southampton based ship builder Vosper Thornycroft moved from its Woolston yard to new facilities at Portchester (near Portsmouth), and also into a newly built ship hall within HMNB Portsmouth. West Quay shopping mall in Southampton city centre was also opened, which attracted many Portsmouth residents away from Portsmouth's traditional shopping areas, favouring the new West Quay mall which offered more variety than Portsmouth's declining Commercial Road and Palmerston Road shopping areas. On 15 May 2005, Portsmouth - now in the Premier League - lost 2-0 away to relegation threatened West Bromwich Albion. Portsmouth's loss earned West Bromwich Albion three points and survival to end one place above the relegation zone. However, this result also affected and confirmed bottom- placed Southampton's relegation to the second tier of English football for the first time since 1978. Portsmouth supporters ironically celebrated their 2-0 loss to West Bromwich Albion as a victory, which had relegated Southampton to a division lower than that of Portsmouth. The last occasion this had happened was in the 1960-61 season, where Portsmouth had been in Division Two and Southampton were in Division Three. In 2015, 10,000 Portsmouth people signed a petition against Portsmouth City Council's decision allow airline Emirates to use its red and white livery (Southampton colours) for its sponsorship of the Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth. The city council subsequently came to an agreement with sponsors Emirates to use blue and gold (Portsmouth colours) instead. == Nicknames == Portsmouth supporters, and occasionally those of other clubs, refer to Southampton supporters as \\"Scum\\" or \\"Scummers\\". According to some Portsmouth fans, the term \\"scum\\" developed out of an acronym standing for Southampton City (or Corporation) Union Men, with the term allegedly originating from when Southampton dockyard workers supposedly crossed the picket lines in the 1930s when Portsmouth dockyard workers were on strike. However this story is unlikely, as the two cities rely on entirely different types of ports ‚Äî Southampton being a merchant port and Portsmouth a naval one. There is also no known record of any strike occurring during the mentioned time period. Rather, this seems to be a modern attempt to incorrectly describe the origins of the rivalry. Southampton supporters have taken to referring to their local rivals as \\"Skates\\", after a Southampton fanzine, The Ugly Inside asked its readers in 1988 to suggest an abusive term most likely to cause offence to Portsmouth supporters. This date coincides with Portsmouth's return to the Football League Division One in its 1987-88 season, when both clubs occupied the same division for the first time since 1976. Skates was chosen as the derisive alternative to \\"matelot\\" to describe naval sailors, Portsmouth being the home of the Royal Navy. In fact, Skate is an abusive term originating from Portsmouth's civilian population, a dismissive one aimed at Royal Navy sailors based in the city. == Derby results in summary \\"First class\\" competitions=== {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Competition !rowspan=\\"2\\"Played !colspan=\\"3\\"Results !colspan=\\"2\\"Goals - !Southampton!!Portsmouth!!Draw !Southampton!!Portsmouth - align=leftSouthern League 32151254343 - align=leftFootball League 28126105036 - align=leftPremier League 422066 - align=leftFA Cup 5410126 - align=leftLeague Cup 220060 - align=leftTOTAL 7135211511791 } ===All official competitions=== Including the above matches, plus Southern District Combination, Western League, Southern Alliance League and other official cup matches.

Although Southampton Saints L.F.C. has the better history, with their record 9 FA Women's Cups won and their once-star player Sue Lopez having made it all the way to the English Football Hall of Fame, most of their achievements came before the creation of the actual Women's Premiership. Portsmouth L.F.C. is a relative newcomer to the women's game by contrast. Both teams played in the Southern Championship in the 2006‚Äì07 season. Portsmouth was a strong contender for promotion (they finished 3rd), while Southampton was relegated to the Regional Combinations. The former Portsmouth manager, Vanessa Raynbird, also played in and later managed Southampton as well. ==Major honours won by the clubs== {  - ! Honours ! Portsmouth !

Deciding to not complete college, he instead engaged in several profitable mercantile pursuits, acting for a time as a forwarder of fresh produce on the lakes and canals of the region. He later engaged in the manufacture of flour at Oswego, New York. He was Mayor of Oswego, New York in 1849 and 1850. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Oswego Co., 1st D.) in 1853, 1854, 1855, 1857, 1859, 1860, 1861, 1866, 1867, 1870, 1871 and 1884. He was Speaker in 1855, 1857, 1859, 1860 and 1861; and was the chief lieutenant of political boss Thurlow Weed. Early in 1861, Littlejohn was influential in the backroom politics to select Ira Harris over Horace Greeley as the Republican Party's nominee to run for the U.S. Senate to succeed William H. Seward, who had not run for re-election, expecting to join President Abraham Lincoln's Cabinet. In September, Littlejohn unsuccessfully sued Greeley and the New York Tribune for libel. With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Littlejohn worked actively to recruit troops in the Oswego area. Littlejohn used his political connections in July 1862 to secure a commission as Colonel of the 110th New York Volunteer Infantry, a regiment he helped raise through his personal efforts. He trained his troops at Camp Patterson near Baltimore, Maryland, where it was stationed until November, when it was ordered to Federal-occupied New Orleans, Louisiana. Returning to politics, he successfully campaigned for the United States House of Representatives. He was elected as a Republican to the 38th United States Congress. He resigned from the army on February 3, 1863, and served in Congress from March 4, 1863, to March 3, 1865. During that term, he was Chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary Pensions. Littlejohn was not a candidate for renomination in 1864. On February 26, 1867, President Andrew Johnson nominated Littlejohn for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 2, 1867.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 741. He moved his residence to Buffalo, New York until 1867, when he moved back to Oswego. Littlejohn wanted to afford Oswego the growth possible by a rail connection to a major port. In 1868, he organized and served as president of the New York and Oswego Midland Railroad (NY&OM;), a route traversing much of New York State on its way to New York City.Find-a-Grave He also established a steamboat service connecting Long Island to his new railroad. In 1870 the Republican state convention nominated Littlejohn for Lieutenant Governor of New York on the ticket with Stewart L. Woodford, but he declined to run. Fed up with the corruption of the Grant Administration, in 1872 Littlejohn joined the Liberal Republican Party and supported the candidacy of Horace Greeley for president in 1872, having set aside his previous legal issues with Greeley. He then became a Democrat, was a delegate to several Democratic state conventions, and was an ally of Samuel J. Tilden. He died in Oswego, and was buried at the Riverside Cemetery. ==See also== *List of American Civil War brevet generals (Union) ==References== Retrieved on 2008-02-12 * Obit in NYT, October 28, 1892 * Brown, John Howard, ed., Lamb's Biographical Dictionary of the United States.

Barth und Sohn Schaustellerbetriebe KG.http://olympialooping.com/#contact The ride was designed by Anton Schwarzkopf and Werner Stengel, and built by BHS. It is the largest portable roller coaster in the world, and the only one with five inversions. It appears at many carnivals in Germany, most notably Oktoberfest, where it made its debut in 1989. It is named for its five vertical loops, which resemble the Olympic rings. Although they are clothoid-shaped, their shape is closer to circular than the ones on most other roller coasters, so they exert unusually high g-forces on the passengers (up to 5.2 g). The entire structure weighs 900 tons and requires a space 85 m wide by 36 m deep. The ride usually runs with five cars per train, though at events such as Oktoberfest and Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park, London, it runs with seven to increase throughput in busy periods. ==Name== The ride is almost always known as Olympia Looping in reference to its loops being painted to match those of the Olympic rings. However, there are two exceptions to this: When being designed, the ride was known as F√ºnfer Looping (Five Loops), continuing a sequence of travelling Schwarzkopf rides that previously included Doppel Looping and Dreier Looping (Double Loop and Triple Loop). This name is occasionally used in trade literature. From 2016, the ride has appeared at London's Hyde Park Winter Wonderland event. In order to avoid reference to the Olympics (as the 2012 Summer Olympics was held in the city), and to fit in with the Bavarian theme of other sections of the event, the ride appears under the name Munich Looping although branding on the ride itself uses the German M√ºnchen Looping. ==Incidents== On September 27, 2008, a driving motor failed on the ride, stranding over 20 Oktoberfest attendees at the top of the first hill. They were freed with the help of the Munich Fire Department. == Awards == Olympia Looping's full layout The ride was ranked in the Steel Roller Coasters Poll 11 Year Results Table awards from 1999 to 2010.

The name is attested as 'Honigar' from the 13th century in Bavaria, and was borne by members of the nobility of the Holy Roman Empire and by the family that founded the Henninger Brewery. It is most prevalent today in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. ==History== There are more than one, seemingly unrelated, Henninger branches from Germany. Seemingly there were branches formed from a variety of spellings in the regions of Hessia, Baden, and Saxony/Bavaria/Bohemia. The earliest origins of the Bavarian/Bohemian name date back to the Dark Ages and started with a different name altogether. In 978, the Saxon nobleman Bruno, Graf von Arneburg, died. His grandson, Wilhelm, Graf von Lutisburg seemingly took on the additional estate of 'von Seeberg' in 1089 due to marriage. Seeberg lies along the modern border of the Czech Republic and Bavaria in the Eger (now called Cheb) and Plan√° region. At the time, it was in the Kingdom of Bohemia. In 1200, Conrad von Seeberg, grandson of Wilhelm, founded a branch of the family, led by his son Thimo von Seeberg, near Vohburg, Bavaria. At that time, a relative of his, perhaps a grandson, took over control of the Schloss Seeberg. His name was Honigar von Seeberg. His descendants held Seeberg until at least 1394. This is the first appearance of the name in historical records. In 1404, there appears to be a family break and another family, Schmiedel von Seeberg, began. The name evolved to Henninger von Seeberg over the centuries. They were ennobled by the Holy Roman Emperor for fighting the Hussites in 1423. They were later raised to the title of Freiherr or Baron von Seeberg in 1571. Branches of the family spread throughout the Bohemian and Hungarian kingdoms over time and Henningers von Seeberg or the derivative 'von Eberg' were listed as knights and nobles throughout those kingdoms. Johann Wenzel Henninger von Eberg was raised to the state of Freiherr in 1744. There is a branch that was ennobled in 1816 in Hungary known as \\"zu Eberka\\" and another branch of the family was ennobled in 1853 for military service by the Austro- Hungarian Emperor. Lieutenant General Emmanuel Henninger, Freiherr von Eberg, was one of the regimental commanders at the Austrian victory at Custoza, Italy in 1866. His father Johann, also an Austro-Hungarian Major General of Army, had been granted the title of Freiherr von Eberg just prior to his death. In Bavaria, a branch of Honigar von Seeberg's family had migrated north from Vohburg to Rothenburg ob der Tauber in the early 15th century. That family continued in the area and in 1816 purchased the Reuter brewery in Erlangen, Bavaria. It was from Erlangen that the larger Henninger brewery family started, branching out into Frankfurt in 1869. The first mention of the Hessian-based Henningers comes from 1423, and those from the Baden area start to occur soon after. To date the region that has the most Henningers today is Baden-W√ºrttemberg. ==Name variations and associated families== * Henninger (Frankish spelling) von Seeberg * Henniger (Rhine spelling) von Eberg * H√∂nniger * Hennigar * Hunninger * Hanygar * Henigar ze ≈Ωeberka * von Gumpenburg * Schmiedel von Seeberg * Hoenniger * Henegar * Heninger * Hanninger * Haninger ==Establishments== * The Henninger Brewery, located in Frankfurt, Germany. * Anthony A Henninger High School, located in Syracuse, New York ==Individuals== * Brian Henninger (born 1962), golfer * Daniel Henninger, journalist * Joseph Morgan Henninger (1906-1999), artist and illustrator * John Hannygar Baron von Eberg, lord of Mƒõ≈°ice Castle, in T√°bor, Southern Bohemia, Czech Republic, built the first water flushing toilets in region in 1792, they still work today * Lieutenant General Emmanuel Henninger, Freiherr von Seeberg, Austro-Hungarian Army * Major General Dieter Henninger, German Republic Army * Johann Henninger Freiherr von Eberg, Director of the Prague Technical Institute circa 1850 * Bishop Prokop Benedickt Henninger Freiherr von Eberg, Superintendent of the Wissenrhad college, Prague 1802‚Äì1809 * Adolphine Henniger von Eberg, composer and pianist - born 1813 Magdeburg, died 1887 M√ºnchen.

It was the band's first release since signing with major record label Parlophone. The EP was released on 4 December 2006 in the United Kingdom to positive critical reviews by that label's offshoot Regal Records (see 2006 in British music) and on 5 December in the United States by Capitol Records. The EP entered the official UK Albums Chart at #62 on 11 December 2006, while the title song entered the download chart at #77. A week later, an entry on band's official MySpace blog stated that had a fifth track not been added to make the EP ineligible in the UK Singles Chart, \\"The Blinding\\" would have entered that chart at #4. As with their debut album, Pete Doherty designed the artwork for the EP. ==Track listing== All lyrics written by Pete Doherty, all music written by Babyshambles. #\\"The Blinding\\" ‚Äì 2:59 #\\"Love You but You're Green\\" ‚Äì 4:35 #\\"I Wish\\" ‚Äì 2:47 #\\"Beg, Steal or Borrow\\" ‚Äì 3:07 #\\"Sedative\\" ‚Äì 4:04 NME reported in October 2006 that the band had recorded eleven songs including those on the EP, and the following tracks not featured on the EP: \\"I Can See from Afar\\", \\"Anguish\\", \\"Stung Me Like Life\\". ==Music videos\\"The Blinding\\"=== The video for \\"The Blinding\\" has been directed by Julien Temple. It was filmed in a deserted West London subway station/underpass. The video features the band performing the song in the subway station, or alternatively cooped up in a glass box, with black gaffer tape covering their eyes, all interspersed with random bits and bobs; skulls, a deer, Pete Doherty standing up in an open coffin, a creepy mannequin, \\"Elvis is dead\\", a chainsaw and a \\"blinded\\" Doherty painting on a wall. Renaissance playwright Christopher Marlowe also makes an appearance. His portrait is stabbed in the eye, as was Christopher Marlowe himself during a bar brawl over the bill‚Äîa wound that ended his life. The video culminates in a general mirror and guitar smashing session, including Doherty stabbing a mirror with his own reflection in it. Paul Roundhill and The General make short appearances. ===\\"Love You But You're Green\\"=== The video for \\"Love You but You're Green,\\" directed by Julien Temple, features the individual band members playing their instruments, never together but at separate locations. Adam Ficek and his drum kit are perched on a traffic island, Drew McConnell is strumming his double bass by a log fire, Mick Whitnall is in a graveyard and Pete Doherty is hanging around, singing and strumming, in front of a run-down wooden shack and later in front of a pile of tyres in what an old car yard. Both this song and \\"The Blinding\\" were originally written while Peter was in The Libertines; however, it is unclear whether any of the other band members co-wrote them or not. ==Chart performance== {  !Chart (2005) !Peak position - align=\\"left\\"UK Albums Chart align=\\"center\\"62 - align=\\"left\\"Japan Singles Chart align=\\"center\\"147 - align=\\"left\\"Danish Singles Chart align=\\"center\\"5 } ==References *babyshambles.net - official band website *babyshamblesofficial - official band MySpace page Category:2006 EPs Category:Babyshambles albums ","title":"The Blinding E.P."},{"id":"7450938","text":"Inglewood United Football Club is an Australian semi-professional soccer club based in Inglewood, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. The club competes in the National Premier Leagues Western Australia. The club are based at Perth Plasterboard Centre Stadium. Inglewood have won the State League Premier League once, in 1996, and the State Cup twice, in 1977 and 1999. Their most recent success was in the 2005 Night Series when they lifted the trophy by defeating Swan I.C. 3‚Äì0. ==History== Kiev Soccer Club was founded in March 1951Federation of Ukrainians in Australia, 'Ukrainians in Australia Volume 1', Melbourne, 1966, p838. by Alexander Minko and Igor Schorsch, migrants from Ukraine. The club took its name from Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, and the famous Dynamo Kyiv team. Their playing colours of gold and blue were adopted from the Ukrainian national flag in the late 1960s. The clubs' original playing strip was all-black. Kiev's first competitive game was on 12 April 1953 when they claimed a 3‚Äì1 victory over Wundowie in Division Three North of the Western Australian Soccer Football Association. In 1962 Kiev entered Division One of the newly formed Western Australian Soccer Federation. The club finished second to Swan Valley to gain promotion to the top flight for the first time. For the next few years they bounced between the top two tiers, changing their name from Kiev to Kiev-Victoria Park and then back to Kiev. Spells at Langley Park in Perth, Weston Street in Carlisle and Raphael Park in Victoria Park preceded the club's 1963 relocation to Walter Road Reserve (now Perth Plasterboard Centre Stadium) in Inglewood, which remains their home ground to this day. 1964 saw Kiev capture their first trophy by finishing top of Division One, with State representative Peter Atkinson voted the league's Player of the Year. Another second tier championship followed in 1967. Kiev announced their top flight return by placing second to Perth Azzurri on the 1968 league table. They went on to win the Top Four Cup, downing Cracovia 2‚Äì1 in the final courtesy of a Bev Allan double. 1970 brought about another name change ‚Äì to Inglewood Kiev ‚Äì and within twelve months a 21-year lease was arranged for the use of Walter Road Reserve. Striker Len Dundo scored himself a hat-trick of Golden Boots as the top flight's leading goal scorer in 1972, 1973 and 1974. In those three seasons alone Dundo amassed 77 goals for Inglewood. The fundraising efforts of long-time club secretary Jack Soer were instrumental in ensuring the club maintained a strong financial position throughout the 1970s. Inglewood commemorated their 25th anniversary with the construction of clubrooms at the northern end of the ground, under the guidance of Vladimir Mandyczewsky. The new bar and office facilities were officially opened in November 1976. 1977 will long be remembered as the year Inglewood truly came of age. Robert Earl (3) and Nick Macallum (2) may have scored the goals in a 5‚Äì1 State Cup final mauling of Spearwood Dalmatinac but it was defender Jimmy Smith who was recognised as best on ground. English import Gordon Todd celebrated his first State League season by taking out the Gold Medal, awarded to the top flights‚Äô best player. John Davidson ensured the year ended on a high by scoring the solitary goal in a 1‚Äì0 Top Four Cup victory over Floreat Athena. Lee Adam created State League history by becoming the first player to collect two Gold Medals, the midfielder winning the prestigious award in 1978 and again in 1980. Memories of England's 1966 World Cup win were revived in mid-1981 when team captain Bobby Moore joined Inglewood for two guest appearances. Midfield livewire Norrie Sutton became Inglewood's fourth Gold Medal winner in six seasons when he won the award in 1982. Inglewood lifted their first Night Series trophy in 1983. A Paddy Morris goal in the first period of extra-time was enough to gain a 1‚Äì0 win over West Perth Macedonia. Further success eluded the club in the years that followed, culminating in relegation to the second tier in 1987. It wasn't until a competition restructure in 1993, brought on by the formation of new peak body the Professional Soccer Federation, that top flight football returned to Inglewood. The following year new president Siggy Kramer secured a new 10-year lease on Walter Road Reserve. The club entered 1995 as Inglewood Falcons and ended it as Premier League runners-up and Top Four Cup finalists. Jason Ainsley was the runaway winner of that season's Gold Medal. Inglewood reached the State League pinnacle by winning the 1996 Premier League under the management of Paul Wormley. Goals in the final minutes of the season by Scott Daley and veteran Ian Ballantyne earned the club a 2‚Äì1 victory over near- neighbours Bayswater City, and their first league title. Norrie Sutton collected his second Gold Medal, Ronnie More was named Goalkeeper of the Year and Paul Wormley the Coach of the Year. The State Cup returned to Inglewood in 1999 courtesy of Gavin Tait, whose second half header was enough to see off Floreat Athena 1‚Äì0. A rebranding to Inglewood United in 2000 preceded the negotiation of a new 25-year lease on Walter Road Reserve. The following year the club celebrated their 50th anniversary with the opening of a new 1,000-seat stadium, the Kramer Family Stand, on the western side of Walter Road Reserve. Although recognised as one of the State League's powerhouse clubs, Inglewood's only trophy capture of recent times has been the 2005 Night Series. Jason Colli, Dean Apelgren and Rory Mouttet were the scorers in a convincing 3‚Äì0 defeat of Swan IC. By contrast, individual accolades have flowed for Inglewood players. Robert Zabica (2000), Oliver Taseski (2001, 2009 and 2011) and Alex Dunn (2018, 2019) were honoured with the Goalkeeper of the Year award, Louis Parkinson (2003), Jack Clisby (2012) and Alex Salmon (2017) added their names to the Gold Medal winners list, with the latter also scoring the Golden Boot (2017). ==Honours== National Premier Leagues Western Australia Champions: 1996 National Premier Leagues Western Australia Runners-Up: 1968, 1977, 1994, 1995, 2016, 2017 State Cup Winners: 1977, 1999 State Cup Runners- Up: 1981, 1995, 2005, 2009 Top Four Cup Winners: 1968, 1977 Top Four Cup Runners-up: 1982, 2008, 1994, 1995, 1996, 2016 Night Series Winners: 1983, 2005 Night Series Runners-Up: 1976, 1979, 1997, 2000 Division One Champions: 1964, 1967 Division One Runners-Up: 1962 Division Three Cup Winners: 1959 ==Current squadCoaching staff== *Technical Director: Alex Stanojevic *First Team Coach: Andres Oliveira *First Team Assistant Coach: Jason Colli *First Team Physio: Katie Holtham *Goalkeeper Coach: Dave Whalley == Season by Season Record == {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" -

In 534, Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei, seeking to assert power independent of the paramount general Gao Huan, fled to Yuwen's domain, and when Gao subsequently proclaimed Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei emperor, a split of Northern Wei was effected, and when Yuwen subsequently poisoned Emperor Xiaowu to death around the new year 535 and declared his cousin Yuan Baoju emperor (as Emperor Wen), the split was formalized, with the part under Gao's and Emperor Xiaojing's control known as Eastern Wei and the part under Yuwen's and Emperor Wen's control known as Western Wei. For the rest of his life, Yuwen endeavored to make Western Wei, then much weaker than its eastern counterpart, a strong state, and after his death, his son Yuwen Jue seized the throne from Emperor Gong of Western Wei, establishing Northern Zhou. == Early career == Yuwen Tai was born in 507, and was a descendant of the last chieftain of the Xianbei Yuwen tribe Yuwen Yidougui, whose tribe was destroyed by Murong Huang, the founding ruler of Former Yan. Yuwen Yidougui's descendants served as generals during Former Yan and its successor state Later Yan. Later, when Emperor Daowu of Northern Wei defeated the Later Yan emperor Murong Bao (Emperor Huimin), Yuwen Tai's great- great-grandfather Yuwen Ling (ÂÆáÊñáÈôµ) surrendered to Northern Wei, and was relocated to Wuchuan (Ê≠¶Â∑ù, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia). Yuwen Tai's father Yuwen Gong (ÂÆáÊñáËÇ±) was known for his ability in battle. In 524, with Northern Wei's northern provinces overrun by agrarian rebels, Wuchuan was being held by one of the major rebels, Poliuhan Baling (Á†¥ÂÖ≠ÈüìÊãîÈôµ). Yuwen Gong and another local leader, Heba Duba (Ë≥ÄÊãîÂ∫¶Êãî), ambushed Poliuhan's general Wei Kegu (Ë°õÂèØÂ≠§) and killed Wei, temporarily restoring order. It was probably at this time that Yuwen Tai met and befriended Heba Duba's son Heba Yue (Ë≥ÄÊãîÂ≤≥). Sometime after this incident, Yuwen Gong and his sons fled to Zhongshan (‰∏≠Â±±, in modern Baoding, Hebei), and were forced to join the army of another rebel general, Xianyu Xiuli (ÈÆÆ‰∫é‰øÆÁ¶Æ). Yuwen Gong died in a battle between Xianyu's troops and Northern Wei troops, but Yuwen Tai continued to serve in Xianyu's troops. After Xianyu was killed by his general Yuan Hongye (ÂÖÉÊ¥™Ê•≠) in 526, another Xianyu general, Ge Rong (ËëõÊ¶Æ), in turn killed Yuan and took over Xianyu's troops, and Yuwen continued to serve Ge. However, he saw that Ge was not a competent leader and considered fleeing with his brothers, but before he could carry out his plans, Ge was defeated by the Northern Wei general Erzhu Rong in 528, and Erzhu forcibly moved Ge's troops to his power base at Jinyang (ÊôâÈôΩ, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Suspicious of the Yuwen brothers, Erzhu killed Yuwen Tai's older brother Yuwen Luosheng (ÂÆáÊñáÊ¥õÁîü), but Yuwen Tai pleaded his case with Erzhu and was spared. In 529, the Northern Wei prince Yuan Hao, under support from Liang Dynasty, attacked Emperor Xiaozhuang and seized the capital Luoyang, declaring himself emperor. Emperor Xiaozhuang fled north of the Yellow River, and Erzhu advanced south to aid him, sending Heba Yue, who was then serving under Erzhu, to lead his forward troops. Heba made Yuwen Tai his assistant, and later on, after Erzhu defeated Yuan Hao, allowing Emperor Xiaozhuang to return to Luoyang, Yuwen was created the Viscount of Ningdu. In 530, Erzhu Rong sent his nephew Erzhu Tianguang, with Heba and Houmochen Yue (‰æØËé´Èô≥ÊÇÖ) as assistants, to attack the rebel general Moqi Chounu (‰∏á‰øüÈÜúÂ•¥), who then occupied the western provinces. Yuwen continued to serve under Heba. After Erzhu Tianguang defeated Moqi, Yuwen, who contributed in the campaign, was made the governor of Yuan Province (ÂéüÂ∑û, roughly modern Guyuan, Ningxia), and he was said to have ruled the province with such kindness and faith that the people of the province proclaimed, \\"Had we had Governor Yuwen as our governor earlier, how would we have joined the rebellion?\\" Late in 530, apprehensive that Erzhu Rong would eventually seize the throne, Emperor Xiaozhuang ambushed him and killed him in the palace. Subsequently, Erzhu Rong's clan members, led by his nephew Erzhu Zhao and cousin Erzhu Shilong, defeated and killed Emperor Xiaozhuang, first making Yuan Ye the Prince of Changguang emperor, and then further replaced Yuan Ye with Emperor Jiemin. In 531, the general Gao Huan rebelled against the Erzhus. Erzhu Tianguang was initially not particularly interested in aiding his Erzhu clan members, but felt compelled to, and he departed Chang'an to head east. While Erzhu Tianguang was away, Yuwen advised Heba to rise against the Erzhus, and Heba did, defeating Erzhu Tianguang's brother Erzhu Xianshou (ÁàæÊú±È°ØÂ£Ω), whom Yuwen subsequently captured, dividing control of the territory with Houmochen. By 532, Gao had defeated the Erzhus and seized much of power, deposing Emperor Jiemin and making Emperor Xiaowu emperor instead. When Gao subsequently tried to intimidate Heba into giving up his territory and reporting to Luoyang, but under the advice of Xue Xiaotong (ËñõÂ≠ùÈÄö), Heba refused. He made Yuwen his lieutenant, and consulted him on most important matters. In 533, Yuwen volunteered to serve as messenger to Gao in order to observe Gao's abilities, and Heba agreed. When Gao met Yuwen, Gao was impressed by the answers Yuwen had to his questions and wanted to detain Yuwen, but Yuwen left Gao's domain before Gao could seize him. Subsequently, Heba sent Yuwen to confer with Emperor Xiaowu, who was not happy about Gao's hold on power, and Emperor Xiaowu and Heba were able to enter into a secret alliance against Gao. Heba made Yuwen the governor of the key Xia Province (Â§èÂ∑û, roughly modern Yulin, Shaanxi). == Taking control over western provinces == By this point, Heba Yue, in alliance with Houmochen Yue, controlled almost all of the western provinces. However, one provincial governor, Cao Ni (ÊõπÊ≥•), the governor of Ling Province (ÈùàÂ∑û, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), was aligned with Gao Huan and refused to follow Heba's orders. Heba Yue sent his assistant Zhao Gui (Ë∂ôË≤¥) to Xia Province to request Yuwen's opinions, and Yuwen, believing that Houmochen was unreliable, advised against an attack on Cao and suggested instead that Houmochen be attacked. Heba refused‚Äînot realizing that by this point, Gao's messengers had persuaded Houmochen to act against him. Heba and Houmochen rendezvoused at Gaoping (È´òÂπ≥, in modern Guyuan, Ningxia), and then headed north against Cao‚Äîbut as they advanced, Houmochen tricked Heba into coming to his camp for discussions, and then had his son-in- law Yuan Hongjing (ÂÖÉÊ¥™ÊôØ) assassinate Heba. Initially, Heba's army was surprised and intimidated, but Houmochen, instead of taking over Heba's army, panicked and fled to Shuiluo (Ê∞¥Ê¥õ, in modern Pingliang, Gansu), while Heba's army, without a central commander, withdrew to Pingliang (Âπ≥Ê∂º, also in modern Pingliang). After some internal discussions, the army commanders decided to offer the command to Yuwen Tai, and they sent Du Shuozhou (ÊùúÊúîÂë®, later changed his name to Helian Da (Ëµ´ÈÄ£ÈÅî)) to Xia Province to summon Yuwen Tai. Yuwen agreed, and Du and he quickly headed back toward Heba's army. (On the way, they encountered Gao's general Hou Jing, whom Gao had sent to try to take over Heba's army; Hou, surprised, withdrew to Gao's territory quickly.) Emperor Xiaowu, hearing of Heba's death, sent Yuan Pi (ÂÖÉÊØó) to summon both Yuwen and Houmochen to the Luoyang. Houmochen outright refused, and Yuwen persuaded Emperor Xiaowu to allow him to remain in command. Emperor Xiaowu agreed. Yuwen next sent a letter to Houmochen to rebuke him, and when Houmochen did not answer, prepared to launch an attack on Houmochen. He advanced quickly on Shuiluo, and Houmochen withdrew to L√ºeyang (Áï•ÈôΩ, in modern Tianshui, Gansu), and then to Shanggui (‰∏äÈÇΩ, also in modern Tianshui). He then further withdrew from Shanggui, and Shanggui surrendered to Yuwen. He decided to try to flee to Cao's territory, but on the way, believing that Yuwen's forces were close, committed suicide. == Alliance with Emperor Xiaowu == Gao Huan made an overture of alliance to Yuwen Tai, but Yuwen refused, instead arresting Gao's messengers and delivering them to Emperor Xiaowu. Emperor Xiaowu authorized him to take over Heba's authorities in the west and created him the Duke of L√ºeyang. Meanwhile, Emperor Xiaowu prepared for an attack on Gao, but meanwhile claimed to Gao that he was preparing to attack Yuwen and Heba Yue's brother Heba Sheng (Ë≥ÄÊãîÂãù), who controlled the southern provinces. Gao saw through Emperor Xiaowu's trick, and in summer 534, he instead advanced south toward Luoyang. Emperor Xiaowu's associate Wang Sizheng (ÁéãÊÄùÊîø), believing that imperial forces would not be able to withstand an attack from Gao, suggested fleeing to Yuwen's domain‚Äîdespite his own reservations about Yuwen's intentions. Emperor Xiaowu agreed, but at the same time summoned Heba Sheng. However, Heba Sheng did not arrive at Luoyang, while Yuwen sent forces east, commanded by Li Xian (ÊùéË≥¢), to welcome Emperor Xiaowu. In fall 534, before Gao's forces arrived, Emperor Xiaowu fled west, meeting Li on the way. Li escorted Emperor Xiaowu back to Yuwen's headquarters at Chang'an, and Emperor Xiaowu reestablished the imperial government there. He made Yuwen his commander in chief, and married his sister Princess PingyiÔºàÂÜØÁøäÂÖ¨‰∏ªÔºâ to Yuwen. After Gao entered Luoyang, he sent messengers to request Emperor Xiaowu to return to Luoyang. When Emperor Xiaowu ignored his request, Gao made his distant nephew, Yuan Shanjian, emperor (as Emperor Xiaojing), dividing Northern Wei into two, with Eastern Wei recognizing Emperor Xiaojing, and Western Wei recognizing Emperor Xiaowu. Yuwen's relationship with Emperor Xiaowu, however, soon deteriorated. Emperor Xiaowu had engaged in incestuous relationships with three of his cousins, at least one of whom, Yuan Mingyue (ÂÖÉÊòéÊúà) the Princess Pingyuan, followed him to Chang'an. Yuwen disapproved of the relationship, and he persuaded the imperial princes to arrest Yuan Mingyue and put her to death. Emperor Xiaowu became angry, and he often showed his displeasure by tightening his bow or by pounding his table in the palace. Around the new year 535, Yuwen poisoned him to death and made his cousin Yuan Baoju the Prince of Nanyang (Yuan Mingyue's brother) emperor (as Emperor Wen). == During Emperor Wen's reign == Western Wei was, initially, the smaller and the weaker of the two successor states of Northern Wei, and early in its existence, there were questions on whether it would survive at all. Yuwen Tai spent much of his effort on preserving existence of Western Wei against repeated attacks led by Gao Huan. He also gradually began to show a trend of following both ancient Chinese customs, as largely encapsulated by the governmental structures of Zhou Dynasty, and restoring Xianbei customs that had largely been abolished by Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei. In this, he was assisted by the official Su Chuo (ËòáÁ∂Ω). He also worked on earning the respect of other officials and generals, including Emperor Xiaowu's confidant Wang Sizheng and Pei Xia (Ë£¥‰ø†), both of whom had initially been suspicious of Yuwen and yet later became important and faithful generals serving under him. In spring 537, Gao Huan and his generals Dou Tai (Á´áÊ≥∞) and Gao Aocao (È´òÊïñÊõπ) launched a major attack on Western Wei. Yuwen, correctly judging that Gao Huan was trying to draw Yuwen toward him while allowing Dou to penetrate Western Wei defenses, announced that he was going to lead a withdraw to modern eastern Gansu but instead made a surprise attack on Dou's army at Xiaoguan (Â∞èÈóú, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), crushing Dou's forces. Dou committed suicide in shame. Gao Huan and Gao Aocao were forced to withdraw. In fall 537, Yuwen led an attack on Eastern Wei and captured Hengnong (ÊÅÜËæ≤, in modern Sanmenxia as well). With Western Wei's capital region Guanzhong suffering from a famine, Yuwen remained in Hengnong to collect food from the area, but then heard that Gao Huan was again launching another attack from the northeast, forcing him to return to the Guanzhong region. The forces engaged at Shawan (Ê≤ôËãë, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), after Gao rejected advice from his general Hul√º Qiangju (ÊñõÂæãÁæåËàâ) to directly attack the Western Wei capital Chang'an. Despite Eastern Wei's numerical superiority, Yuwen's forces crushed Gao's forces, and Gao was forced to withdraw. In winter 537, the Western Wei general Dugu Xin captured the former Northern Wei capital Luoyang, and several other nearby provinces also surrendered to Western Wei. In spring 538, in order to create an alliance with Rouran, Yuwen first had Emperor Wen bestow the title of Princess Huazheng to Yuan Yi (ÂÖÉÁøå), the daughter of a member of the imperial clan, to marry her to Yujiul√º Tahan (ÈÉÅ‰πÖÈñ≠Â°îÂØí), the brother of Rouran's Chiliantoubingdoufa Khan Yujiul√º Anagui. But Yuwen, believing that to be insufficient, requested Emperor Wen divorce his wife Empress Yifu and marry Yujiul√º Anagui's daughter. Emperor Wen was forced to agree, and he deposed Empress Yifu, ordering her to become a Buddhist nun, and married Yujiul√º Anagui's daughter as empress. (In 540, under Rouran pressure, Empress Yifu would be forced to commit suicide.) By summer 538, however, Eastern Wei generals Hou Jing and Gao Aocao had surrounded Luoyang. Yuwen and Emperor Wen proceeded to Luoyang to try to lift the siege. When Yuwen arrived, Hou and Gao initially lifted the siege on Luoyang, but when Yuwen chased after them, his horse was shot by an arrow, and he fell off his horse and was nearly captured, but both he and his general Li Mu (ÊùéÁ©Ü) pretended to be common soldiers and were able to escape. Once Yuwen returned to Western Wei camp, Western Wei forces again attacked and killed Gao. Later that day, however, an Eastern Wei counterattack inflicted major losses on Western Wei forces, forcing Yuwen to withdraw and rendezvous with Emperor Wen at Hengnong. Meanwhile, however, Eastern Wei captives in Chang'an heard of the Western Wei defeat and rebelled within the city, led by the general Zhao Qingque (Ë∂ôÈùíÈõÄ), forcing the official Zhou Huida (Âë®ÊÉ†ÈÅî), who had been left in charge of Chang'an, to flee the city with the crown prince Yuan Qin. Under the advice of Lu Tong (Èô∏ÈÄö), Yuwen quickly returned west and defeated Zhao, suppressing his rebellion. Around this time, Yuwen also started setting up his headquarters at Hua Province (ËèØÂ∑û, roughly modern Weinan), not far from Chang'an but maintaining some distance from the capital, incorporate many talented officials and generals into his staff. He further established a night school for the junior officers and officials in his administration at Hua Province. In 541, under Su's suggestion, Yuwen had Emperor Wen issue an edict outlining six principles of government, intending to reduce corruption and wastefulness and strengthen the economy: #Qingxinsi (Ê∏ÖÂøÉÊÄù) -- ordering the officials to clean their hearts and not desire many things. #Dunjiaohua (Êï¶ÊïôÂåñ) -- instituting a regime of moral education. #Jindili (Áõ°Âú∞Âà©) -- the concept of encouraging agriculture and maximizing the utility of the land. #Zhuoxianliang (Êì¢Ë≥¢ËâØ) -- finding capable individuals to promote, regardless of their family backgrounds. #Xuyusong (ÊÅ§ÁçÑË®ü) -- forbidding torture and instituting the concept that it would be preferable to let the guilty go than to punish an innocent. #Junfuyi (ÂùáË≥¶ÂΩπ) -- the concept that tax and labor burdens must be fair, and that powerful families may not avoid them. Yuwen ordered that all of the officials of the state must study the six principles and further be able to balance budgets, at the pain of being relieved from their offices. In spring 543, the Eastern Wei official Gao Zhongmi (È´ò‰ª≤ÂØÜ), the governor of North Yu Province (ÂåóË±´Â∑û, roughly modern Zhengzhou, Henan), angry that Gao Huan's son Gao Cheng had tried to rape his second wife, and in a dispute with Gao Cheng's assistant Cui Xian (Â¥îÊöπ) over his having divorced Cui's sister, rebelled and surrendered his headquarters of Hulao (ËôéÁâ¢, in modern Zhengzhou) to Western Wei. Yuwen personally led troops to try to save Gao Zhongmi. At Luoyang, however, he was defeated by the Eastern Wei general Peng Le (ÂΩ≠Ê®Ç) and was nearly captured, only managing to elude capture by throwing gold at Peng to bribe him and persuade him that if he captured Yuwen, he would be no longer any use to Gao Huan. The next day, a Western Wei counterattack in turn almost killed Gao Huan, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Yuwen was forced to withdraw, but against advice from Feng Zihui (Â∞ÅÂ≠êÁπ™) and Chen Yuankang (Èô≥ÂÖÉÂ∫∑), Gao Huan failed to chase Yuwen and allowed him to escape. The defeat was considered so major that Yuwen offered to have his rank reduced, but Emperor Wen did not accept the request. In 545, Yuwen, seeing that one of Rouran's vassals, Tujue, was growing in strength, sent a messenger, Annuo Pantuo (ÂÆâË´æÊßÉÈôÄ) to Tujue to greet its chief Ashina Tumen, to try to establish friendly relations. In 546, Gao Huan launched another major attack on Western Wei, putting Yubi (ÁéâÂ£Å, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) under siege, intending to draw Western Wei forces to try to save Yubi, but Yuwen took no reaction to it, instead leaving Yubi's defense to the general Wei Xiaokuan. Wei ably defended Yubi, draining the strength of the Eastern Wei forces, and as Gao grew ill, Eastern Wei forces were forced to withdraw with major losses. Later in 546, Su died. Yuwen mourned him greatly, and personally attended Su's burial, crying bitterly. In spring 547, the Eastern Wei general Hou Jing, who was in charge of Eastern Wei provinces south of the Yellow River, believing that Gao Huan had died (indeed, Gao had, although his son Gao Cheng was keeping the death a secret) and not willing to submit to Gao Cheng, surrendered the provinces initially to Western Wei and then to Liang. Yuwen conferred honorary titles on Hou, but was initially unwilling to send relief troops. With Wang Sizheng advocating taking four provinces that Hou offered in exchange for aid, however, Yuwen sent Li Bi (ÊùéÂºº) and Zhao Gui to assist Wang, initially forcing Eastern Wei forces attacking Hou to withdraw. Soon, however, Western Wei generals and Hou began to suspect each other, and after Yuwen ordered Hou to proceed to Chang'an to greet Emperor Wen and Hou refused, the sides officially broke, and the Western Wei generals held onto the four provinces without rendering further aid to Hou, who from that point on depending solely on Liang aid. (Later that year, however, the Eastern Wei general Murong Shaozong (ÊÖïÂÆπÁ¥πÂÆó) would crush Liang forces commanded by Xiao Yuanming, the nephew of Emperor Wu of Liang, capturing Xiao Yuanming, and then in early 548 defeat Hou and force him to flee to Liang, taking all of the provinces back except the four that Western Wei had taken.) In summer 548, Yuwen and Yuan Qin the Crown Prince carried out a tour of Western Wei's border provinces, but upon hearing that Emperor Wen was ill, cut their tour short and returned to Chang'an. However, when they did, Emperor Wen had already been healed, and Yuwen thereafter returned to his headquarters at Hua Province. Around the same time, the Eastern Wei general Gao Yue (È´òÂ≤≥, Gao Huan's cousin) launched an attack on Yingchuan (ÊΩÅÂ∑ù, in modern Xuchang, Henan), one of the major cities that Western Wei took from Hou. Wang, defending Yingchuan, initially repelled Eastern Wei's attacks, but with Eastern Wei diverting Wei River (Ê¥ßÊ∞¥) to flood Yingchuan, it was in the danger of falling. Yuwen sent Zhao to try to lift the siege, but Zhao was impeded by the water and was unable to proceed to Yingchuan. A counterattack by Wang, however, killed Murong Shaozong and Liu Fengsheng (ÂäâË±êÁîü), temporarily relieving the pressure on Yingchuan. Gao Cheng himself reinforced Gao Yue's army, and by summer 549 captured Yingchuan, taking Wang captive. With Yingchuan having fallen, Yuwen ordered a general withdrawal from the area, and the provinces taken from Hou were retaken by Eastern Wei. Meanwhile, with Hou having rebelled against Liang's Emperor Wu in 548 and captured the Liang capital Jiankang in 549, Liang was in disarray, with Hou and the various imperial princes and governors fighting for control. By winter 549, one of the Liang princes, Xiao Cha the Prince of Yueyang (Emperor Wu's grandson), fearing an attack from his uncle Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong (Emperor Wu's son), surrendered his domain around the city Xiangyang (Ë•ÑÈôΩ, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) to Western Wei, requesting protection. Yuwen sent the general Yang Zhong (Ê•äÂø†) to aid Xiao Cha, and after Yang defeated and captured Xiao Yi's general Liu Zhongli (Êü≥‰ª≤Á¶Æ) in spring 550, Western Wei made peace with Xiao Yi, setting the borders in such a way to put Xiao Cha under Western Wei's protection. Yuwen created Xiao Cha the title \\"Prince of Liang,\\" preparing to have him claim the Liang throne as Western Wei's vassal. In summer 550, Gao Cheng's brother Gao Yang, who had controlled the Eastern Wei government after Gao Cheng's death in 549, forced Eastern Wei's Emperor Xiaojing to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and starting Northern Qi (as its Emperor Wenxuan). In response, Yuwen launched a major attack on the newly established Northern Qi, reaching Jian Province (Âª∫Â∑û, roughly modern Jincheng, Shanxi). However, Gao Yang himself led a strong army to defend against Yuwen's attack, and Yuwen, upon hearing that Gao Yang's army was well-run, made the comment, \\"Alas, Gao Huan is not dead.\\" Meanwhile, due to rains, the livestock that Western Wei forces relied on were dying in large numbers, and so Yuwen was forced to retreat. While there appeared to be few casualties, Northern Qi was in turn able to make minor border gains in light of Yuwen's withdrawal. Around the new year 550, another son of Liang's Emperor Wu, Xiao Guan (Ëï≠Á∂∏) the Prince of Shaoling, attempted to recapture Anlu (ÂÆâÈô∏, in modern Xiaogan, Hubei), which Yang had earlier captured from Xiao Yi. Yuwen sent Yang to relieve Anlu, and Yang not only did so, but proceeded to siege Xiao Guan's headquarters at Ru'nan (Ê±ùÂçó, in modern Jingmen, Hubei), capturing it and then executing Xiao Guan. In spring 551, Emperor Wen died, and Yuan Qin succeeded him (as Emperor Fei). == During Emperors Fei's reign == Yuwen Tai appeared to hold an even firmer grip on power after Emperor Wen's death. Emperor Fei's wife Empress Yuwen was Yuwen Tai's daughter, and while it was recorded that he did not have any concubines because he loved her greatly, it could have also been that he feared Yuwen's power and therefore did not have any concubines. In summer 551, the Tiele were launching an attack on Rouran, when Tujue's chieftain Ashina Tumen intercepted the Tiele and captured a large number of the Tiele people. Ashina Tumen, after his victory, sought a marriage with a daughter of Yujiul√º Anagui. Yujiul√º Anagui felt insulted and refused, viewing the Tujue as inferior; in response, Ashina Tumen cut off relations with Rouran. Yuwen took this opportunity to create an alliance with Tujue, sending the Princess Changle to Tujue to marry Ashina Tumen. In summer 552, with Xiao Yi and Hou Jing battling each other, Xiao Yi sought help from Western Wei and agreed to cede Nanzheng (ÂçóÈÑ≠, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) to Western Wei, but the order was declined by Xiao Yi's cousin, Xiao Xun (Ëï≠Âæ™). Yuwen and his general Daxi Wu (ÈÅîÂ•öÊ≠¶) thus attacked Hanzhong. Xiao Xun instead turned to another brother of Xiao Yi, Xiao Ji the Prince of Wuling for aid, and Xiao Ji sent reinforcements commanded by the general Yang Qianyun (Ê•ä‰πæÈÅã). Yuwen and Daxi put Nanzheng under siege, and due to the length of the siege, Yuwen and Daxi became angry and ordered that the city be slaughtered when it falls, but at the intercession of Xiao Xun's chief of staff Liu Fan (ÂäâÁí†), whom Western Wei forces captured during the siege and whose talent Yuwen respected, Yuwen rescinded the order. Soon thereafter, Xiao Xun surrendered, and Nanzheng was in Western Wei hands. Yuwen initially agreed to allow Xiao Xun to return to Liang, but instead detained him, releasing him only after Liu again persuaded him to do so, reminding him of his promise. (During the conversation Liu had with Yuwen, Liu commented that he initially thought of Yuwen as Tang of Shang and King Wu of Zhou, but because of his failure to follow his promise, found him to be less than Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin. Yuwen instead compared himself to Yi Yin (‰ºäÂ∞π, a legendary regent of Shang Dynasty) and Duke of Zhou, apparently disavowing intentions on the throne for the time being.) In spring 553, with Xiao Ji and Xiao Yi, both of whom having claimed Liang's imperial title after Hou's fall, battling each other, Xiao Yi sought aid from Western Wei, requesting Western Wei to attack Xiao Ji's home base of Chengdu (ÊàêÈÉΩ, in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) from the rear. Yuwen sent his nephew Yuchi Jiong to attack Xiao Ji's domain (modern Sichuan and Chongqing). Most of Xiao Ji's domain fell into Western Wei hands, and subsequently, Xiao Ji was defeated and captured by Xiao Yi. In winter 553, the imperial official Yuan Lie (ÂÖÉÁÉà) formed a conspiracy to kill Yuwen, but the news leaked. Yuwen killed him. Following Yuan Lie's death, Emperor Fei himself was angry and wanted to kill Yuwen, despite advise from his cousins Yuan Yu (ÂÖÉËÇ≤) the Prince of Huaiai and Yuan Zan (ÂÖÉË¥ä) the Prince of Guangping. However, Emperor Fei's apparent attempt to court the imperial guards became known by the commanders, several of whom were Yuwen's sons-in-law, and Yuwen put Emperor Fei under house arrest and then deposed him, replacing him with his younger brother Yuan Kuo the Prince of Qi (as Emperor Gong). Yuwen took this opportunity to change the Han names for the Xianbei that Emperor Xiaowen had instituted back to the original Xianbei names, including changing the imperial surname Yuan back to Tuoba. Further, because Xianbei legends indicated that originally, the Tuoba tribe had 36 subtribes and 99 subclans, Yuwen chose 36 key Han generals and 99 commanders and changed their names to Xianbei names, to fill out the original names. Yuwen subsequently put the former emperor to death. It was recorded that Empress Yuwen, Yuwen Tai's daughter, also \\"suffered death because of her loyalty to Wei,\\" but it is not known exactly whether Yuwen killed her. == During Emperor Gong's reign == In spring 554, while on a diplomatic mission to Liang (now with Xiao Yi as its undisputed emperor‚Äîas Emperor Yuan), the Western Wei official Yuwen Renshu (ÂÆáÊñá‰ªÅÊÅï, probably Yuwen Tai's relative but relationship is unclear) was slighted by Emperor Yuan, who treated Northern Qi's ambassador with far greater respect. Emperor Yuan then further aggravated the situation by sending an impolite letter to Yuwen Tai demanding that the borders be redrawn in accordance with old borders. Yuwen made the comment, \\"Xiao Yi is the type of person that, as said in proverbs, 'One who has been abandoned by heaven cannot be revived by anyone else.'\\" Yuwen Tai therefore began to prepare attacking Emperor Yuan at his headquarters of Jiangling (Ê±üÈôµ, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), as Emperor Yuan had made Jiangling his capital and declined to move back to the old capital Jiankang. The Western Wei general Ma Bofu (È¶¨‰ºØÁ¨¶), formerly a Liang general, secretly revealed the attack plans to Emperor Yuan, but Emperor Yuan did not believe Ma and took minimal precautions. In winter 554, under Yuwen Tai's orders, Western Wei forces, commanded by Yu Jin (‰∫éË¨π), who was assisted by Yuwen Tai's nephew Yuwen Hu and Yang Zhong, launched a major attack on Liang. Emperor Yuan initially did not take reports of the Western Wei attack seriously, and while he summoned his major generals Wang Sengbian and Wang Lin from afar, he himself took little defensive or evasive actions. Yu quickly descended on Jiangling and put it under siege. Soon, Emperor Yuan surrendered, and Western Wei forces gave him to Xiao Cha to be executed. Western Wei created Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang (as Emperor Xuan) and gave him the Jiangling area (known in history as Western Liang) in exchange for his old domain of Xiangyang area, which Western Wei took control directly. (However, the rest of Liang did not recognize Emperor Xuan, and soon recognized a rival candidate for the throne supported by Northern Qi, Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming.) Most residents of Jiangling were seized as slaves, although eventually most of them were released by Yuwen after he was persuaded to do so by one of the captives, the Liang official Yu Jicai (Â∫æÂ≠£Êâç). Around the near year 556, after Tujue's Mugan Khan Ashina Qijin thoroughly crushed Rouran's last khan Yujiul√º Dengshuzi, Yujiul√º Dengshuzi fled to Western Wei. Ashina Qijin demanded the execution of Yujiul√º Dengshuzi, and Yuwen Tai, fearing a Tujue attack, turned Yujiul√º Dengshuzi and 3000 of his followers to the Tujue ambassadors, who slaughtered them. Also around the new year 556, Yuwen Tai promulgated a new government structure, dividing the government into six ministries, based on the Zhou Dynasty model. (This structure was initially devised by Su Chuo, and after Su Chuo's death, Yuwen had it further revised by Lu Bian (ÁõßËæØ).) He also had Tuoba Yu the Prince of Huai'an submit a request, and then have Emperor Gong formally approve the request, to have all imperial princes reduced in rank to dukes, in accordance with the Zhou tradition. In spring 556, Yuwen was pondering the issue of succession. His wife Princess Pingyi had one son, Yuwen Jue, but his oldest son, Yuwen Yu, was born of his concubine Lady Yao, and was married to the daughter of one of his chief generals, Dugu Xin. On the advice of Li Yuan (ÊùéÈÅ†), who argued that the son of a wife always had precedence over the son of a concubine, Yuwen Tai made Yuwen Jue his heir apparent. in fall 556, while Yuwen Tai was on a tour of the norther provinces, he became ill at Qiantun Mountain (ÁâΩÂ±ØÂ±±, in modern Guyuan, Ningxia). He summoned his nephew Yuwen Hu to Qiantun and entrusted the affairs of the state as well as his sons to Yuwen Hu. He soon died, and Yuwen Jue took over his titles, while Yuwen Hu took the reins of the state, and under Yuwen Hu's tutelage, Yuwen Jue soon took the throne from Emperor Gong, ending Western Wei and establishing Northern Zhou. ==Family== * Parents: ** Yuwen Gong, Emperor De (; d. 526) ** Empress De, of the Wang clan of Lelang () * Consorts and Issue: ** Empress Wen, of the Yuan clan of Henan (; d. 551) *** Yuwen Jue, Emperor Xiaomin (; 542‚Äì557), third son ** Empress Xuan, of the Chinu clan (; d. 574) *** Yuwen Yong, Emperor Wu (; 543‚Äì578), fourth son *** Yuwen Zhi, Prince Weila (; d. 574), sixth son ** Furen, of the Yao clan () *** Yuwen Yu, Emperor Ming (; 534‚Äì560), first son ** Fei, of the Dabugan clan () *** Yuwen Xian, Prince Qiyang (; 545‚Äì578), fifth son ** Furen, of the Quan clan () *** Yuwen Jian, Prince Qiaoxiao (; 551‚Äì578), eighth son ** Furen, of the Wuliuhun clan (), personal name Xianyu () *** Yuwen Tong, Prince Jikang (; 555‚Äì571), 12th son ** Lady, of the Wang clan () *** Yuwen Zhao, Prince Zhaojian (; d. 581), seventh son ** Lady, of the Zhang clan (), personal name N√ºbi () *** Yuwen Da, Prince Daibi (; d. 581), 11th son ** Unknown *** Yuwen Zhen, Duke Songxian (; d. 550), second son *** Yuwen Chun, Prince Chenhuo (; d. 581), ninth son *** Yuwen Sheng, Prince Yueye (; d. 581), tenth son *** Yuwen You, Prince Tengwen (; 556‚Äì581), 13th son *** First daughter (d. 554) **** Married Yuan Qin of Henan (; 525‚Äì554) *** Princess Xiangyang (), fifth daughter **** Married Dou Yi of Henan, Duke Shenwu (; 519‚Äì583), and had issue (two sons, two daughters), their daughter Lady Dou would later become the wife of Li Yuan, the founding Emperor of the Tang Dynasty *** Princess Yi'an () **** Married Li Hui of Liaodong, Duke Wei () *** Princess Shunyang () **** Married Yang Zan (; 550‚Äì591) *** Princess Pingyuan () **** Married Yu Yi of Henan, Duke Ren (; d. 583), and had issue (three sons) *** Princess Yongfu () **** Married Shi Xiong () *** Princess Xihe () **** Married Liu Chang, Duke Peng (; d. 597) *** Princess Yigui () **** Married Li Ji, Duke Qinghe (; 531‚Äì561), and had issue (one son) *** Princess Yidu () **** Married Liang Rui, Duke Jiang (; 531‚Äì595) *** Princess Deguang () **** Married Zhao Yongguo of Tianshui (; d. 557) *** A daughter who married Heba Wei, Duke Huo () *** A daughter who married Ruogan Feng, Duke Xu () == References == * Book of Zhou, vols. 1, 2 . * History of Northern Dynasties, vol. 9 . * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 152, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166.

Like many other professional bodybuilders from Europe such as Milos Sarcev and Pavol Jablonicky, Rockel grew up under communist rule. Because of this Rockel was not aware of bodybuilding and other things of the outside world. This soon changed in 1989 when the Berlin Wall was taken down. At seventeen years of age and 143 pounds, he decided that he wanted a body like Arnold Schwarzenegger's after seeing the film Conan the Barbarian, but at the time commercial gyms in his hometown of Chemnitz, East Germany, were non existent. Instead of abandoning his interest in bodybuilding, he created his own weight set. Following the demise of communism, entrepreneurial activities in the East of Germany spawned and with that the first gym opened in Ronny's hometown. He soon joined and began absorbing information about diet and weight training from other members and fitness magazines. At his first competition, the Hessian Championships, he placed last in his class. But he did not become discouraged, he came back a year later and won the 1995 NABBA German Nationals and placed third at the NABBA Mr. Universe. From then Rockel decided that he had the potential to become a professional bodybuilder. == Contest history == *1994 NABBA Hessian Championships, Did not place *1995 NABBA German Nationals Championships, 1st *1996 NABBA World Championships, Medium, 3rd *1998 NABBA Mr Universe, Medium, 2nd *1999 NABBA Mr Universe, Medium, 2nd *2000 NABBA Mr Universe, Medium, 2nd *2000 WABBA World Championships, Short, 1st *2002 WABBA International German Championships, 1st (HW and Overall) (Pro Card) *2003 IFBB Grand Prix Holland, 7th *2003 IFBB Grand Prix Hungary, 4th *2003 IFBB Maximum Pro Invitational Grand Prix, 6th *2003 IFBB Night of Champions, 15th *2004 IFBB Grand Prix Australia, 7th *2004 IFBB Grand Prix England, 7th *2004 IFBB Grand Prix Holland, 7th *2004 IFBB Hungarian Pro Invitational, 6th *2004 IFBB Ironman Pro Invitational, 10th *2004 IFBB Night of Champions, 14th *2005 IFBB Grand Prix Australia, 3rd *2005 IFBB Mr. Olympia, 17th *2006 IFBB Grand Prix Australia, 1st *2006 IFBB Mr. Olympia, 16th (tied) *2006 IFBB Grand Prix Austria, 5th *2006 IFBB Grand Prix Holland, 3rd *2007 IFBB Arnold Classic, 8th *2007 IFBB Grand Prix Australia, 2nd *2007 IFBB Colorado Pro, 4th *2007 IFBB Santa Susanna Pro, 3rd *2007 IFBB Mr. Olympia, 11th *2008 IFBB Arnolds Classic, 13th *2008 IFBB Grand Prix Australia, 6th *2008 IFBB Grand Prix New Zealand, 6th *2008 IFBB New York Pro Championships, 3rd *2008 IFBB Mr.Olympia 14th *2009 IFBB Mr.Olympia 7th *2010 IFBB Arnolds Classic, 6th *2010 IFBB Mr Europe, 1st *2010 IFBB Mr.Olympia, 6th *2011 IFBB Arnolds Classic, 6th *2011 IFBB Mr. Europe Gran Prix, 1st *2011 IFBB New York Pro Championships, 2nd *2013 IFBB Arnold Classic, 13th *2014 IFBB Ferrigno Legacy, 1st *2015 IFBB Mr. Olympia, 14th *2015 IFBB Ferrigno Legacy, 2nd *2016 IFBB Mozolani Pro (Men's 212), 2nd *2016 IFBB Mr. Olympia (Men's 212), 9th *2017 IFBB New York Pro Championships (Men's 212), 1st *2017 IFBB Toronto Pro Supershow (Men's 212), 1st *2017 IFBB Mr. Olympia (Men's 212), 7th *2017 IFBB EVL¬¥S Prague Pro (Men's 212), 3rd *2017 IFBB Kuwait Pro (Men's 212), 7th *2018 NAC Frey Classic Pro Am, 2nd == References  * Official Website Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Professional bodybuilders Category:German bodybuilders Category:People from Erzgebirgskreis ","title":"Ronny Rockel"},{"id":"7450990","text":"Route 140 or Highway 140 may refer to: ==Australia== * Hamilton Highway ==Canada== *25px New Brunswick Route 140 *25px Ontario Highway 140 *25px Prince Edward Island Route 140 ==Costa Rica== *25px National Route 140 ==Germany== *25px Bundesautobahn 140 ==India== *25px National Highway 140 (India) ==Japan== *25px Japan National Route 140 *25px Fukuoka Prefectural Route 140 *25px Nara Prefectural Route 140 ==Malaysia== *25px Malaysia Federal Route 140 ==United States== *25px Interstate 140 (two current highways) *25px U.S. Route 140 (former) *25px Alabama State Route 140 *25px Arkansas Highway 140 *25px California State Route 140 *25px Colorado State Highway 140 *25px Connecticut Route 140 *Florida State Road 140 (pre-1945) (former) **Florida State Road 140A (pre-1945) (former) **25px County Road 140 (Madison County, Florida) *25px Georgia State Route 140 *25px Illinois Route 140 *25px Indiana State Road 140 *25px Iowa Highway 140 *25px K-140 (Kansas highway) *25px Kentucky Route 140 *25px Louisiana Highway 140 *25px Maine State Route 140 *25px Maryland Route 140 *25px Massachusetts Route 140 *25px M-140 (Michigan highway) *Missouri Route 140 (former) *25px Nevada State Route 140 *25px New Hampshire Route 140 *25px New Jersey Route 140 *25px New Mexico State Road 140 *25px New York State Route 140 **25px County Route 140 (Broome County, New York) **25px County Route 140 (Erie County, New York) **25px County Route 140 (Fulton County, New York) **25px County Route 140 (Montgomery County, New York) **25px County Route 140 (Niagara County, New York) **25px County Route 140 (Onondaga County, New York) **25px County Route 140 (Rensselaer County, New York) **25px County Route 140 (Wayne County, New York) *25px North Carolina Highway 140 *25px Ohio State Route 140 *25px Oregon Route 140 *25px Tennessee State Route 140 *25px Texas State Highway 140 **25px Texas State Highway Loop 140 (former) **25px Texas State Highway Spur 140 **25px Farm to Market Road 140 *25px Utah State Route 140 **25px Utah State Route 140 (pre-1969) (former) *25px Vermont Route 140 *25px Virginia State Route 140 **25px Virginia State Route 140 (pre-1933) (former) **25px Virginia State Route 140 (1933-1949) (former) *25px Washington State Route 140 (former) *25px West Virginia Route 140 *25px Wisconsin Highway 140 ;Territories: *25px Puerto Rico Highway 140 { border=\\"1\\" align=\\"center\\" -

The species belongs to the genus Limnodynastes. The twelve species in the genus are characterised by a lack of toe pads. Following phylogenetic analysis, the species was placed in L. peronii clade group alongside L. depressus, L. tasmaniensis and L. peronii. ==Description== A demonstration of the butterfly-shaped blotch between the long-thumbed frog's eyes The long- thumbed frog is a medium-sized frog reaching about 50 mm in length. It is grey or brown with abnormal shaped darker patches or irregular spots, and in most individuals a butterfly-shaped patch between the eyes. There is normally a red or purplish patch above the eye. It is similar in many respects to L. tasmaniensis from which it can be most reliably distinguished by its call. The belly is white. The tympanum is indistinct. == Distribution and habitat == This species inhabits drier areas west of the ranges of New South Wales as well as southern Queensland, northern Victoria and eastern South Australia. It is associated with rivers, dams and creeks (often temporary) in woodland and grassland. During drier conditions they shelter under rocks, in cracked mud and yabby burrows. ==Behaviour and ecology== Males make a dog-like \\"rok\\" or \\"whrup\\" call from grassy areas around the edge of water bodies, after rain or when water levels are high, during spring to autumn. Breeding occurs mostly after heavy rain and eggs are laid in a floating foamy mass, often attached to vegetation. Eggs and tadpoles are generally found in slow moving or still waters Tadpoles can reach up to 69 mm and as an opportunistic breeder metamorphosis can occur at any time of the year. The tadpoles are very similar to Limnodynastes tasmaniensis and cannot be readily distinguished until metamorphosis. == As a pet == In Australia, this species may be kept in captivity with a license. == Conservation == Although the species population is considered 'Least Concern' under the IUCN Red List and stable, L. fletcheri threatened by habitat loss. The species is also becoming increasingly threatened by altered flow regimes across Australia's rivers. There is a positive relationship between flooding frequency and the breeding activity for L. fletcheri Flooding between September and December is required to maximise breeding responses from the species, this will increase the likelihood of species persistence and diversity. Therefore, the species may be negatively affected by regulatory activities such as damming and would respond positively to environmental flow management ==References Further reading == *Anstis, M.

It was created by five young Melbourne writers and designers, who edited the magazine: Mel Campbell, Stuart Geddes, Natasha Ludowyk, Penny Modra and Jeremy Wortsman. The first issue appeared on 9 April 2005, and after eleven issues (plus several special issues) the magazine was officially declared defunct on 30 August 2008. Most of the content was by the editorial team or from young local writers and illustrators, though submissions of articles, reviews, fiction, or other responses to the themes for a planned issue were open to anyone. Is Not contributors also hailed from Finland, the United States and Argentina. The magazine was posted at 50 sites around Melbourne on public walls and in venues including caf√©s, bars and laundromats. Is Not was a non-profit enterprise that received no revenue from advertising; instead it was funded by charging entry to its issue launches, which were themed parties with live music and entertainment rather than traditional literary launches.Article in The Age on the magazine's second birthday event Is Not was also available worldwide by sales of subscriptions and back issues on its online store. It was only available in its full-size poster format. Is Not exclusively used fonts created by the European typographic design studio Underware. Issue four was repackaged in booklet format (though at full size and with no other changes to its layout) as Is Not Take-Away #1, intended as a showcase of Underware's typography.Is Not Take-Away #1 at Underware In October 2007, Is Not produced a special issue in conjunction with the Melbourne International Arts Festival to celebrate the career of festival guest, choreographer Merce Cunningham. The editors described the \\"Who Is Merce Cunningham?\\" issue as \\"a map-like interconnected sea of names, works, events, and places associated with Merce, along with articles that form a group/personal/historical document of this artist and his contribution to contemporary art and culture.\\"\\"Who Is Merce Cunningham?\\" issue in the Is Not Friendly Society newsletter == Philosophy == The magazine aimed to explore complexity and ambiguity in both its format and content. Each issue had two seemingly contradictory or overlapping themes, with writers and illustrators encouraged to address the relationship between the two.Interview with co-editor Mel Campbell at OnVoiceOver The magazine served as an outlet for new writing, but its design was also an \\"editorial experiment\\". The poster had grid references at its edges, used for the contents instead of page numbers. Submissions were accepted not only via post and email, but also via SMS or by writing on the posters themselves. Some short articles, poems and stories were deliberately printed at a size which could be read when photographed by a mobile phone camera. \\"Just the idea that a magazine can be more than words on paper is something we like,\\" said co- designer Jeremy Wortsman. \\"And it maintains this sense of curiosity, wonder and innovation\\".Profile of Is Not Magazine in Computer Arts magazine Is Not was also an experiment in the uses of public space for purposes other than advertising. \\"We recognise that people are very suspicious of advertising material encroaching on their lives. They don‚Äôt like being treated as a target market,\\" said co-editor Mel Campbell. \\"It‚Äôs really important to us that we address people in a genuine way, as thinkers, readers and as citizens who are engaged with the city around them.\\"Interview with co-editor Mel Campbell at OnVoiceOver == Local and international recognition == In 2005 issue two of Is Not Magazine was featured at the TypeCon design conference in New York. The magazine was featured at the CMYK Magazine Festival in Barcelona. In 2007 Is Not was featured at Colophon 2007, a magazine festival in Luxembourg curated by Jeremy Leslie, Andrew Losowsky and Mike Koedinger.Colophon 2007 The magazine was featured in The Melbourne Design Guide, a definitive catalogue of creative culture in Melbourne.Melbourne Design Guide Is Not Magazine formed part of the city of Melbourne's successful submission to UNESCO's City of Literature program. In 2009, the magazine was displayed in The Independent Type: Books and Writing in Victoria, an exhibition of local literary history held at the State Library of Victoria. == Awards == Geddes and Wortsman won the 2006 Victorian Premier's Communications Design Prize for their work designing Is Not's first six issues.Victorian Premier's Awards 2006 In 2009 the final issue, \\"All That Glitters Is/Not Gold\\", was nominated for the Designs of the Year award at the Design Museum in London. == Subsequent projects == From their collaboration on Is Not, Geddes and Wortsman together founded Chase & Galley, a collaborative design practice with a particular focus on publication design. Wortsman also founded an illustration agency called the Jacky Winter Group, which specialises in placing work by Australian illustrators in international publications. Wortsman also established a Melbourne gallery space known as Lamington Drive. Due to his expanding commitments Wortsman stepped down from his directorship of Chase & Galley, but returns for occasional projects.

The store was renamed Olds, Wortman & King in 1901; Olds & King again in 1944; and Rhodes in 1960. Moving several times within the downtown Portland area, the store settled at 10th & Morrison in 1910, in a large new building that remained in operation as a department store until 1974 and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Since 1976, the building has been known as the Galleria. ==History== William P. Olds The company traces its ancestry to a small store established in 1851 by Henry Corbett at the intersection of Front and Oak streets in downtown Portland;\\"Store Celebrates 90th Year: Event Recalls Pioneer Days\\". (July 31, 1941). The Oregonian, p. 6. it was the city's first general merchandise store. Later in the 1850s, the store moved to Front & Taylor and was operated by brothers Robert and Finley McLaren, although Corbett continued to be a principal supplier of goods for the store. John Wilson purchased the store in 1856. Wilson's store moved in 1868, to Front Street near Morrison Street. In 1878, Wilson sold the shop to William Parker Olds, who had worked as a clerk there since 1869, and Olds' stepfather, Samuel Willard King, and the business became Olds & King, or Olds & King's. At that time, the store was located at 147 3rd Street. It moved again in 1881, 1887 and 1891, but never very far. John Wortman joined the firm in 1890, and later Hardy C. Wortman also purchased into it, leading eventually to its renaming as Olds, Wortman & King at the beginning of 1901.Takes a New Name: \\"Olds & King\\" Changed to \\"Olds, Wortman & King\\" (December 30, 1900). The Sunday Oregonian, p. 25. Retrieved August 23, 2011. The store's location since 1891 was 5th & Washington, but growth in business led the owners to begin planning in 1908 for a move to a larger building. ===Landmark store=== In 1909‚Äì1910, the company built its large new store in the block bounded by Morrison, Alder, 10th and 9th streets in downtown. The new building was five stories tall, plus a basement, and was the first store in the Northwest to occupy an entire city block ( in downtown Portland). The site had previously been occupied by the mansion of Sylvester Pennoyer, a former Oregon governor (1886‚Äì1895) and Portland mayor (1896‚Äì1898). The new store opened on July 30, 1910, with an estimated 25,000 people visiting on opening day.\\"New Store [a] Beauty; Youth and Old Age Both Enjoy Grand Opening\\". (July 31, 1910). The Morning Oregonian, p. 10. The old store was closed upon the opening of the new one. The new location was criticized by some as being too far from the central business district, which generally extended a few blocks from the waterfront at that time, but within a few years the business district had expanded westwards. The building's interior was designed by the Portland architectural firm of Doyle, Patterson & Beach. The store included a atrium in the center, topped by a large skylight and was equipped with other amenities that were considered very modern for the time, at least in a city the size of Portland. Among these were the elevators, six in total (in two banks of three), which rose and descended in exposed shafts facing the atrium, within ironwork cages. Each was controlled by an elevator operator. Also considered novel and advanced at the time were the glass display cases illuminated with \\"hidden electric lights\\" and a telephone-based credit system that enabled instant verification of a customer's credit status, making purchasing on credit simpler and faster than previously. There was a tea room with mahogany furniture, a nursery and children's playroom, and a roof garden. A 1926 remodeling replaced the hardwood floors in the main aisles with marble. The building's white exterior is lined with relatively simple terra cotta designs. There are rusticated columns at street level. Each of the roof's four corners is topped by a tall flagpole. The store had one entrance on each of its four sides, all but one in the center of the block. ===Ownership changes, second store=== The company was bought in 1925 by the B.F. Schlesinger Company (which also owned The City of Paris store in San Francisco, Schlesinger & Sons in Oakland, and Rhodes Brothers in Tacoma). At that time, Olds, Wortman & King was one of the largest retail businesses in the city and was employing 1,200 people. In 1941, B.F. Schlesinger Company changed its name to Western Department Stores, Inc..\\"Store [corporation's] Name Changed\\". (June 3, 1941). The Oregonian, section 3, p. 4. In 1944, the name of its Portland subsidiary was shortened again to Olds & King. A five-year remodeling in 1946‚Äì51, led by Portland architect Pietro Belluschi, included replacement of the passenger elevators with more modern ones, installation of escalators and closure of the atrium (in 1949), among other changes. Western opened a second Olds & King store in Portland's then-new Gateway Shopping Center (at NE 102nd Avenue and Halsey Street) in 1956,\\"Official Ribbon Cutting Opens Store In East Side Gateway Shopping Site\\". (October 20, 1956). The Oregonian, section 2, p. 5. but in 1960 Western changed its name to Rhodes Western and renamed as \\"Rhodes\\" all of its stores that were not already using that name (prior to this, Western had also operated stores under two other names, Kahn's and Olds & King).\\"Olds & King's 2 Stores To Change Names Sept. 6\\". (July 11, 1960). The Oregonian, p. 1. The 13-store Rhodes chain was taken over by AMFAC Merchandising Corporation, parent of Liberty House, in 1969. The Gateway Rhodes became a Liberty House store in late 1973.\\"Rhodes store in downtown to be closed\\". (October 30, 1973). The Oregonian, p. 1. The downtown Rhodes store, the last in Portland to carry the Rhodes name,Federman, Stan (January 27, 1974). \\"Department store death sad affair\\". The Sunday Oregonian, section 1, p. 29. closed on February 2, 1974.\\"Nostalgia, sadness mark Rhodes end\\". (February 3, 1974). The Sunday Oregonian, p. F5. The building remained vacant for some time. ==The Galleria== The Galleria at night In 1975, Portland developers Bill Naito and Sam Naito purchased the building and began converting it into a multi-level shopping center, which they named The Galleria. Opened in 1976, the Galleria was an indoor shopping arcade for dozens of small stores and restaurants, and has been described as downtown Portland's first shopping mall. Retail shops and restaurants occupied the first three floors, while floors 4 and 5 were leased to companies in the wholesale apparel business.\\"Galleria space leased to wholesalers\\". (March 16, 1976). The Oregonian, p. 11. Three months after the Galleria's opening, The Oregonian newspaper referred to the project as being possibly \\"the most exciting development in downtown [Portland] merchandising in several decades.\\" In the mid-1970s, retailing was increasingly migrating from the city center to new suburban shopping malls, and fewer and fewer shoppers were coming to downtown, a trend that the Naitos hoped to slow or reverse through this project and others. The renovations included opening up the interior by restoring the 1949-closed central atrium and adding a large central stairway. By 1977, when the reconfigured building reached full occupancy, 48 merchants were leasing space there. The \\"recycled landmark\\" was popular with shoppers from the very start and continued to thrive for several years. However, the opening of Pioneer Place in 1990 was a significant blow to the Galleria and the beginning of its gradual decline as a multi-store shopping mall. Most retail use of the building has since been supplanted by various other uses. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991, as the \\"Olds, Wortman and King Department Store\\". It is currently home to the Portland location of the Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts (formerly the Western Culinary Institute), on the 5th floor, and Sanford‚ÄìBrown Portland on the 4th floor. The ground floor has a Brooks Brothers store and a Le Cordon Bleu restaurant. A MAX light rail station, Galleria/SW 10th Avenue station, was opened next to the building in 1986, across the street from its Morrison Street side. Since 2001, the Portland Streetcar line has passed the Galleria's west side, on 10th Avenue. In spring 2011, it was reported that Target Corporation was considering remodeling the Galleria's second and third floors as a Target store, which would be that chain's first Portland store set in a dense, urban location rather than a suburban-style environment. This proposal was continuing to advance in October 2011, following the approval by the city's Historic Landmarks Commission of the proposed modifications to the building's interior. Construction began in February 2012, and the store opened in July 2013. ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Southwest Portland, Oregon ==References *History of Olds, Wortman & King from Pdxhistory.com *PortlandMaps.com property record Category:1878 establishments in Oregon Category:1974 disestablishments in Oregon Category:Buildings and structures in Portland, Oregon Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Oregon Category:Retail companies established in 1878 Category:Defunct companies based in Oregon Category:Defunct department stores based in Oregon Category:Department stores on the National Register of Historic Places Category:National Register of Historic Places in Portland, Oregon Category:Portland Historic Landmarks Category:Southwest Portland, Oregon ","title":"Olds, Wortman &amp; King"},{"id":"7451075","text":"The following is a list of characters seen in the American animated television series Frisky Dingo. ==Major characters== {  width=\\"800px\\" - !colspan=\\"6\\" Major Characters - - !Character's Name !Status !Last Seen Alive !Seasons !Voiced By !Notes -  Killface  alive  2x12  1, 2  Adam Reed  rowspan=\\"3\\"  All three characters were taken into space. -  Xander Crews  alive  2x12  1, 2  Adam Reed -  Simon  alive  2x12  1, 2  Christian Danley -  Stan  alive  2x12  1, 2  Stuart Culpepper  Stan returned in The Xtacles, continuing his role as president. -  Sinn  deceased  2x11  1, 2  Kelly Jenrette  Shot in the head by Valerie. -  Grace Ryan  deceased  2x11  1, 2  Kate Miller  Grace, as Antagone, was eaten alive by Cody 2 after giving birth to him.

A muscular, maniacal super-villain, Killface is an alien with pale white skin, red eyes, a skull-like face, and feet resembling huge clawed talons. He talks with a British accent. Killface does not wear clothes, nor does he appear to possess external genitalia, despite having a son, Simon. He has superhuman healing abilities, having once survived most of his chest being blown away as well as surviving from a pipe jutting out of his lung (Which he uses to kill a seemingly incompetent doctor). Killface has constructed the Annihilatrix, a rocket device designed to propel the Earth directly into the sun. However, having spent twenty billion dollars developing the Annihilatrix, Killface has insufficient funds for a media buy with which to market his global takeover. He is revealed to be a member of an alien race, charged with destroying Earth by his mother; surprisingly, the other members of his species - like his son, Simon - are fully clothed, making his nakedness an enduring mystery. ===Xander Crews / Awesome X / Barnaby Jones=== Xander Crews (voiced by Adam Reed), whose alternate identity is the superhero Awesome X, is the 33-year-old billionaire owner of Crews Enterprises. By the time of the series, Awesome X and his team of high-tech armored soldiers, the Xtacles, have effectively eliminated the supervillain threat, making superheroes unnecessary. Awesome X and the Xtacles are headquartered in a Low Orbiting Hovership,http://i1.wp.com/www.panelsonpages.com/wp- content/uploads/2013/11/desktops-xcalibur-xtacles-9602.jpg the Xcaliber, which costs Crews Enterprises five million dollars a year to maintain, and with no supervillains for them to fight, Stan, Crews's second-in-command and head of the Crews Enterprise Board of Directors, wants to downsize. He announces Awesome X's retirement, unbeknownst to Crews, who prefers to play superhero and waste money on his own entertainment. Crews is also the very proud owner of Train Island, and has been featured in two adult films during his more lean pecuniary years: \\"Head of the Ass\\" and \\"Check Me Out, I Suck\\". For the former film, Crews participated in the award-winning documentary \\"The Making of Head of the Ass: The Documentary about the Porno\\". Xander Crews has a third identity, Barnaby Jones, which he makes up so that he can trick Killface into being his best friend after Killface is blinded. This is necessary because at the time Xander Crews befriends Killface using the new Barnaby Jones identity, Stan has taken over Crews Enterprises and the Xtacles have turned against him and tried to kill him, and all of his money is gone, too, leaving him with nothing (in fact, he goes around naked as Barnaby Jones because he doesn't even have any clothes at this point). He maintains this fake identity until shortly after Killface bites his ear off in a fight to the death in Chinatown, after which time he returns to his original Xander Crews identity in order to reclaim his billionaire fortune, his title as CEO of Crews Enterprises, and his title as Awesome-X. ===Simon=== Simon (voiced by Christian Danley) is the son of Killface. He is an emotionally unstable, gangsta-rap listening, overweight, blond-haired child version of Killface who mumbles unintelligibly when he speaks. He enjoys eating Cap'n Crump brand cereal endorsed by his favorite rapper Taqu'il, although he often ends up smashing the bowl on the floor in a show of adolescent defiance. It is stated in the episode \\"The Miracle\\" that Simon is gay, and his apparent boyfriend is the LARPing hobbit Bobo T. Baggins. However, a later episode has Simon telling his father that he lied about being gay to spoil Killface's presidential aspirations. ===Stan=== Stan (voiced by Stuart Culpepper) is the no-nonsense head of the board of Crews Enterprises and runs the day-to-day operations of the company in Xander Crews' absence, or when Xander just doesn't care enough to come to the office. In the first season, Stan is one of the few people to know Awesome X's secret identity. The rest of the Board of Directors consists of flesh-eating clones of Stan who only communicate by saying \\"HARUMPH!\\". When Crews is believed to be dead, Stan takes over the identity of Awesome X for his own purposes. He later wins election as the Vice President of the United States, as Ta'quil's running mate, after Killface and Crews are found to be ineligible to be President, due to not being from Earth and old enough, respectively. After Ta'quil dies in the series finale of Frisky Dingo, Stan is shown as the new President in the Xtacles spinoff. ===Sinn / Hooper=== Sinn (voiced by Kelly Jenrette) is Killface's sexy female servant. She has a mechanical arm, replacing the one that Killface ripped off, and her speech has an electronic affect. Sinn is romantically involved with Arthur, and often refers to Killface as \\"Sire.\\" When Killface fires Sinn, replacing her with \\"Barnaby Jones\\" (Xander Crews), she joins the Xtacles under the alias of Hooper. The Xtacles are attracted to her, and she used this to control the group which is renamed the Deceptacles. She also forms an evil alliance with Antagonie, Dread Lobster and Valerie. She is shot to death by Valerie after attempting to have sex with her. ===Grace Ryan / Antagone=== Grace Ryan (voiced by Kate Miller) is a television reporter who often covers Awesome X's battles. Grace considers herself to be Xander's girlfriend and desperately wants to bear his children, although Xander takes their relationship much less seriously and does his best to break things off with her. Grace is unaware that Xander is secretly Awesome X. Grace often proves to be pushy, obnoxious, clingy and self-idolizing, to the point where even her news crew wishes for her death. Despite Xander's attitude toward her, and her cheating on him once, Grace remains fanatically devoted to him, even freezing some of his semen without his knowledge, which she later uses to impregnate herself. When she falls into a barrel full of superintelligent radioactive ants, the ants inhabit her brain and Grace frequently becomes \\"Antagone\\", a criminal mastermind; after Xander rejects her marriage proposal, Ryan becomes Antagone permanently and is bent on killing Crews. As Antagone, she is killed by her own mutated child, who devours her head upon birth. ===Arthur Watley / The Dread Lobster=== Arthur Watley (voiced by Scott Lipe) is an intern at Crews' Company and inventor of the Antfarm Keyboard, Arthur Watley was the object of Xander's initial idea for making a new villain, \\"The Dread Lobster,\\" a half-man, half-lobster; his hands are removed and replaced by giant crustacean claws. At first, Watley's body rejects the claws, but he pulls through and begins to change into a giant crab. Watley started out as the Crews Company accountant, but later took refuge underneath the sea, leaving behind a heartbroken Sinn, until Anatagone fishes him out to recruit him as a fellow villain. Watley first pursues a romantic relationship with Sinn but is rejected when she instead falls for Val. He then falls in love with Antagone, but he is soon beheaded by Wendell in a fit of jealousy. Afterward, his body is cooked and eaten by the Deceptacles (formerly known as the Xtacles). ===The Xtacles / Deceptacles=== The Xtacles (voiced by Lucky Yates) are Awesome-X's band of hetero- questionable, death prone, excitable, mercenary super soldiers. They see Awesome-X as a cool, friendly boss and are eager to please him. They are extremely violent and tend to have a high mortality rate. Although individual members of the group are often referred to by name (Mike, Fat Mike, New Fat Mike, Clint, Cliff, etc.), the Xtacles tend to have very similar (or often the same) voice. The Xtacles also have a tendency to be easily distracted from their objectives, and are very prone to suggestion. Their trademark catchphrase is the exclamation \\"Boosh!\\" All the Xtacles have a remote- controlled explosive device in their helmets, which Stan later uses to blackmail them into finding Xander Crews when he goes missing. At first Xander does not realize that they are men in power armor and instead believes them to be robots. This unfortunately results in one of their deaths when he tries to take him apart and power him on in a flashback during season two. Multiple characters assume control of the Xtacles at various times, including Stan, Sinn, and Valerie. The Xtacles change their name to the \\"Deceptacles\\", and begin wearing black armor instead of red, when Sinn takes command. During this period they also create a theme song for themselves that parodies the Transformers theme -- \\"Deceptacles! More than you bargained for!\\" ===Ronnie=== Ronnie (voiced by Adam Reed) is an Xtacle of ambiguous sexuality who speaks with a heavy Slavic accent. He has a homoerotic fixation with Xander Crews. The Xtacles commonly refer to Ronnie's desire to rape. Ronnie spends the majority of his screen time pantless as the bottom half of his armored suit was stolen by Xander Crews when he attempted to rape him. In a bit of cruel irony, Ronnie was horrifically crushed from the waist down by a gigantic pair of Haggar pants in episode 208 after saving Xander's and Wendell's lives. He uses the final seconds of his life wishing he had seen Hannah Montana, and then rapidly bleeds to death once the pants are lifted off of him. ===Wendell T. Stamps / Wendell X / Steve from Machete Squad=== Wendell T. Stamps (voiced by Adam Reed) Claims to formerly be a member of the Department of Labor, on loan from the CIA, which neither confirms nor denies Wendell's involvement, investigating Torpedo Vegas' underground rabbit fights. He later becomes part of the Secret Service and Killface's main bodyguard during his campaign for the Presidency. Wendell tends to kill needlessly, killing a man out of retaliation for the supposed murder of his then partner, Cody, whom he then frames for the murder when he finds he's alive, killing a pharmacist for threatening to call the police on him, and killing Arthur when he tries to marry Antagone. At one point, he claims to be a racist. ===Taqu'il=== Taqu'il alternatively spelled T'aquil, Ta'quil, or Taq'uil (voiced by Killer Mike) is a world-famous rapper whose videos are, apparently, in heavy rotation. He was Killface's presidential running mate, helping gain votes by assuring black people that Killface will eventually be assassinated, making him president. He does spend some time as president. He is eaten alive by the creature known as Cody 2, when he willingly jumps into its mouth while holding a bomb, leaving the creature unfazed and everybody curious to what his plan was. === Mr. Ford === Mr. Ford is an affable, bald-headed, older black gentleman with a fast, marble-mouthed manner of speech. This, combined with his short-tempered intolerance for all who do not understand him directly, makes Mr. Ford a difficult character to comprehend and abide. He is, however, a straightforward communicator, able to say whatever is on his mind; and able to say it with impunity to whomsoever he is speaking. In consequence, his comments are often blunt, inappropriate, but honest and direct. Mr. Ford takes on many jobs throughout the series, beginning as a pet-shop owner, then moving up the vocational ladder to become a gun-shop owner. It is through this pursuit that we witness, (in flashback), a younger, afro-sporting Mr. Ford working as an attendant in a hospital caring for mentally disabled children. Mr. Ford's penultimate job is working as the Secretary for Homeland Security; his ultimate job would be the job that followed, serving as America's Commander- in-Chief. Through the questionable auspices of a \\"corrupt Supreme Court,\\" and, \\"more specifically, a corrupt Stephen Breyer,\\" the character Taqu'il becomes America's first black president, and thereby appoints Mr. Ford to the position of Secretary for Homeland Security. Only following the ostensible deaths of President Taqu'il and his entire cabinet aboard Air Force One, as well as the unfortunate ant-poisonings of the House Speaker and President pro tempore of the United States Senate, does Secretary Ford become the second Mr. Ford - - the first being Gerald Ford - - to become President of the United States. We know that Mr. Ford is fond of the ladies, fond of golf, and concerned with \\"Double-keggers\\" or \\"Doppelg√§ngers,\\" or, perhaps, both. He comments upon his own ubiquity within the series thus: My ass is everywhere. The character, and his catchphrase, would make a cameo appearance years later in an episode entitled \\"Drift Problem,\\" (Season 3, Episode 7), from the animated series Archer; also created by Adam Reed. The character \\"Mr. Ford\\" is voiced by a \\"Mr. Ford\\". ===Valerie=== Valerie commonly referred to as Val (voiced by Amber Nash) spends time as the high-strung, abused assistant to Killface. Angered at and possibly insane from the abuse, she tries to kill Killface and Xander Crews many times. She also bought Ronnie's robot pants from Simon, which she used to escape after one of her failed assassination attempts. Along with Sinn and Antagone, she establishes the short lived \\"Sisterhood of Chaos\\" which quickly took control of both the Decepticles and the Annihilatrix. However Valerie soon became tired of sharing power and kills Sinn (after briefly seducing her as a lesbian), wears her bullet proof Decepticles armor and attempts to kill Antagone. She gains the Annihilatrix key and GPS, but loses her short lived leadership of the Decepticles. ===Nerds=== The nerds are three geeks that are obsessed with things like Dungeons & Dragons, Star Trek, and Live Action Role-Playing Games (LARPing). They are always seen costumed respectively as a halfling (Bobo T. Baggins), a knight (Steve), and a wizard (Kevin). While preparing for Larpstock, the nerds meet Xander Crews when Ronnie's Xtacle pants ran out of power and Xander falls from the sky onto their gazebo. They agree to drive Xander around and all three nerds are beaten up by Antagone. The nerds meet Nearl's corpse when it falls from the sky onto the same gazebo, and they later throw him off of a building. From nearby, Valerie shoots Kevin dead with a sniper rifle. In an homage to Weird Science, the two remaining nerds try to bring Nearl back to life. While filming a Larp video, Steve captures Xander's campaign jet as it crashes into the ground because of Simon's missile attack. Bobo is a homosexual who has dated Simon, and is responsible for the RPG missile attack on Killface, having received the weapon from Simon on a blind date, he is misled by a photoshopped picture of Simon's head on his father's body. Mr. Ford later uses the same launcher to shoot down Air Force One with Stan and President Taqu'il on board. Bobo also received the Annihilatrix spare coupling from Simon, and gave it to Wendell in exchange for performing a sexual favour. Killface threatens Bobo into revealing the whereabouts of the spare coupling and throws Bobo into his bedroom afterwards. ==Minor characters== {  width=\\"800px\\" - !colspan=\\"6\\" Minor Characters - !Character's Name !Status !Last Seen Alive !Seasons !Voiced By !Notes -  Nearl  deceased  1x10  1  Adam Reed  Nearl was killed by Ronnie, who felt the plot was getting too complicated. -  Hooker  alive  ?  1, 2  Amber Nash  Hooker and Old Spice are last seen riding a motorcycle during the opening of The Xtacles. -  Trent and Brent  both are deceased  1x1  1  Brendon Small  Both characters die in the first episode.

He is later used as a substitute for Xander Crews by the Xtacles, who learn that he is in fact the long lost twin brother of Xander Crews, forced to live in a mental hospital by his parents, who preferred to think of him as dead. Nearl is then left on the street after the hospital becomes defunct. After having his mental disability treated with \\"brain chemical\\", he swears revenge against Xander by threatening to kill him, but is soon shot in the back of the head by Ronnie the Xtacle to prevent the series from becoming any more complicated. The corpse is then found by the three nerds of the previous episode, the last two attempt to reanimate it. Like Xander, Nearl is voiced by Adam Reed. ===Hooker=== Hooker is a prostitute that discovers Xander is Awesome X. She parlays this into becoming a millionaire and stealing his mansion and, at one point, robs Wendell with the help of an Albino woman. She and Old Spice become a couple. ===Trent and Brent=== Trent and Brent (voiced by Brendon Small) are twins who are kidnapped by Killface to help promote the destructive power of the Annihilatrix. Both attended USC Film School and became victims of Killface's murderous rages after loud mouthing him about the failing marketing strategies. ===Old Spice=== Old Spice is an elderly man from China. He helps Killface and Crews escape from a sweatshop. Xander hires him as an advisor. Old Spice betrays Xander to live in his mansion with 'Hooker'. In the first season, Old Spice's lines in Mandarin are correctly subtitled. However, in the second season, Mandarin lines are sampled from first-season episodes with new, incorrect subtitles. ===Darcelle Jones=== Darcelle Jones is a beloved and adored female African-American star reporter for Team Jaguar News. Grace openly hates her, thinking (correctly) that Darcelle is out to steal her glory. Later Jones seemingly perishes in a plane crash along with the rest of Team Jaguar. === Baby Lamont === Baby Lamont is a penguin that was trapped on an ice floe, and became the poster child for global warming. Lamont's gender is never revealed, but it is assumed he is a male penguin. Lamont is intelligent and can understand human speech. After accidentally curing global warming, Killface adopts Baby Lamont to be his animal mascot for the presidential campaign. Killface accredits most of his popularity to Baby Lamont's support. Lamont is frequently chirping and can only be silenced by being fed a fish. Taqu'il torments Lamont constantly, and Killface alternates between treating Lamont nice or mean. Killface gets upset at the Haggar Pants Debate after Carter Hawkins reveals that Killface isn't qualified to run for presidency, due to not even being an earth citizen, let alone a U.S. citizen. Baby Lamont is \\"accidentally\\" crushed to death when Killface uses him in a strong upper-cut that breaks Xander Crews' neck. The death is what fuels Killface to resume his plans for world destruction. ===Torpedo Vegas=== Torpedo Vegas (voiced by Mike Schatz) is a gangster who organizes illegal sporting events such as \\"death rabbit\\" fights in Chinatown. He kidnaps Killface's son but lets him go when impressed by his father's sense of character. ===Dottie Bunch=== Dottie Bunch is Killface's presidential campaign manager. It is implied that she has helped several politicians succeed in the past, and she has inside information on some of America's leaders. She is a heavy smoker and often spends Killface's campaign money on expensive, imported vodka, earning much of Killface's contempt as a result. She has been known to make obscene advances on Wendell, but spends more time insulting him. She is a spin-doctor and turns Killface's missteps into good publicity. Dottie proposed and convinced Killface to make Taqu'il his running mate. She and the entire election team are nearly killed from Bobo's errant missile, but fortunately Killface's chest absorbed most of the explosion. Dottie is still injured, receiving a broken arm and her hair starts to fall out. In a flashback, she is accidentally shot while presenting Killface's new campaign advertisement to an Xtacles focussing group that degenerated due to bad grape soda (Killing a female job coach in the process), but apparently Dottie made a full recovery. After Killface was unprepared for an upcoming presidential debate, Dottie berates him and throws a barb about the failed Annihilatrix and Killface's refusal to read her talking points. Killface feels insulted and angrily shoots Dottie in the head, killing her instantly. Killface then humorously sees this as a reminder to fix the Annihilatrix. ===Simone=== Simone is a homeless prostitute and a heroin addict. Her speech is slurred and incomprehensible, probably because of her heavy drug use. Her lack of breasts, masculine build, 'front bulge', and the fact that she probably sodomized Xander Crews at some point prior to meeting his daughter suggest that s/he is a transvestite or transsexual. Xander meets Simone in the year after the Annihilatrix cured global warming, when Xander is living on the streets. Simone is hired as the secretary for Xander's Outreach Center, based out of a cardboard box, and becomes employee of the month. At one point, Xander mistakes Simone for dead and leaves her in a dumpster. To get an IOU on a sexual favour, Wendell trades Simone with Ronnie's old pair of Xtacle pants; with thus become Simone's Kickin' Pants. Simone is last seen being questioned by Valerie, where Simone asks \\"Do you wanna take a dump in my mouth?\\" This causes Val to jet boot away. Simone made a cameo appearance in Archer season 6 episode 7, \\"Nellis.\\" ===Philip Mazzone=== Phillip Mazzone\\"The Odd Couple\\" episode, 2 minutes 57 seconds in, on a billboard (Phil) (voiced by Mike Bell) appears early in the series and is the apparent Program Manager of the Annihilatrix. He is a pudgy, bald-headed, Jason Alexander-type, with a distinct lack of ethical propriety. His proximity to the Annihilatrix during its construction has given him cancer, a condition which his wife, Lorraine, cannot abide as she kicks Phil out of his house after hearing his diagnosis. This forces Phil to move in with his employer, Killface, even though he is suing him for his condition. Unable to settle with Phil, Killface's assets are frozen and ultimately turned over to him. Phil then sells the principal asset, the Annihilatrix, for $20,000,000,000, and then pays Killface a visit with complementary pickles. There, an attempted Vitoxin (ochrocarpus longifolius) poisoning fails to kill Phil, as he has made himself immune to the contaminant through incremental self-dosing. Then, on the Killface patio, the now less-fat and cancer-free Phil is shot through the head by Valerie, who is aiming for Killface. ===Harper Ellis=== Harper Ellis is the \\"suspiciously handsome\\" pundit representing the left-wing on the \\"Carter Hawkins Show\\". The character is based on - and voiced by - Ellis Henican. ===Cody 2=== Cody 2 is a gigantic, soft-skinned white mutant as tall and wide as the Annihilatrix. At birth he was the size of an overweight child, but quickly grew exponentially into a huge monster. He is the half-human, half-ant offspring of Antagone and Xander Crews via artificial self-insemination. \\"His\\" gender is unknown; it is implied that \\"he\\" is male because Wendell names him Cody 2, after his former partner. Cody 2 is extremely intelligent and seems to understand Wendell's talking. After birth, Cody 2's first act was to kill an exhausted Antagone by biting her head off. Wendell quickly tamed Cody 2 with a belt and setting boundaries and began to ride Cody 2 around the Town. After several stops, Cody 2 and Wendell reached the Annihilatrix and attack several main characters there. Ta'quil, armed with some sort-of machine, jumps into Cody 2's mouth and is swallowed whole, without harming the creature. A spaceship carrying several of Killface's species arrives. It shoots Cody 2 several times, and he dies, leaving a depressed Wendell. ===Ashley=== Ashley is the negligent secretary of Xander Crews. She frequently informs him of meetings and calls that are several minutes late, and at one point is noted as not even being on-site. Although she is never seen on-screen, her name can be seen on Xander's phone many times throughout the series as she does her job, rather poorly. ===Carter Hawkins=== Carter Hawkins is the host of the right-wing pundit show \\"Carter Hawkins Show.\\" Through the run of Season 2 he is shown moderating the presidential debate, eventually informing both candidates that neither of them are eligible to run. Hawkins is a take on American cable news pundits in the vein of Chris Matthews and Glenn Beck. ===Jack Taggart=== Jack Taggart (voiced by Marshall Bell) The main character of The Xtacles spinoff, Jack Taggart is the former leader of the Xtacles, and currently the acting leader. His armor has silver shoulder and forearm parts, differentiating him from the other Xtacles. He also has a scar over his right eye, the origin of which is unexplained. He is suicidally loyal to Awesome X. ===A.L.E.X.=== A.L.E.X. (voiced by Rachael Harris) is the Xcalibur's holographic computer. She takes the form of a blond woman in a skin-tight blue suit, though it has been shown that she can change her form. A.L.E.X. is the voice of reason to the usually impulsive and idiotic Xtacles, though she is rarely listened to. ==References *Killface's profile on MySpace *Xander's profile on MySpace *Simon's profile on MySpace *Ta'Quil's profile on MySpace *Article About Simon's Rabbit Fights on GNN Frisky Dingo Category:Frisky Dingo ","title":"List of Frisky Dingo characters"},{"id":"7451085","text":"There are varying scholarly opinions regarding the permissibility of masturbation (') in Islam'. Islamic scripture does not specifically mention masturbation. There are a few Hadiths mentioning it, but these are classified as unreliable. ==ViewpointsSahabah view=== The opinions of some of the companions of Muhammad reproduced below from Ibn Hazm's Al-Muhalla (vol.11 pg. 393‚Äì394) indicate that they did not forbid it: Abd Allah ibn Abbas said: * \\"marrying slave girl (concubine) is better than it, and it is better than fornication/adultery (zina)\\" * \\"it is nothing but rubbing one's private parts until a fluid comes out\\" Abdullah ibn Umar said: * \\"a person who does makes a fool of himself\\" * \\"it is merely rubbing an organ\\" JƒÅbir ibn Zayd said: * \\"it is your water; you can discharge it (if you want)\\" ===Sunni view=== The Sunni schools of jurisprudence (known as madhaahib ‚Äì the Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki, Hanbali, and Zahiri schools of Fiqh) have differing stances on the issue. Some see it forbidden in certain cases (i.e. if it leads a man/woman to ignore their spouse sexually) but recommended it when they see it as a lesser evil to illicit sex. It is generally prohibited according to the Hanafi and Hanbali madhaahib, unless one fears adultery or fornication, or is under the desire pressure, in which case, it is permissible to seek a relief through masturbation. It is prohibited all the time according to the Maliki and Shafi\`i madhaahib.Marriage in Islam ‚Äì Part 1 by Hussein Khalid Al-Hussein, PhD Refer to: Section Al-\`Alaqat Al-Mubahah (Allowed Relationships) Zahiri Imam Ibn Hazm regards masturbation as permissible. Scholars have also stated that masturbation would not be necessary if one realizes the flexible approach Islam takes to marriage. For example, according to Sheikh Shomeh Yerkity, 'against the clear teachings of Islam, marriage has been rendered another difficult process today due to warped customs and conventions and undue expectations. When we approach marriage from the point of view of pristine Islam, we shall find less and fewer people being forced to exercise the above type of exceptional rulings'. Yet if one's desire is so overwhelming one might perform masturbation but in that case it will be like eating the flesh of a pig to survive from major hunger or starvation when no other food is available. It is considered permissible for spouses to masturbate each other, with the only sexual acts forbidden in Islam being anal intercourse and vaginal sex during menstruation. > 'Hasan bin 'Ali (May Allah be pleased with them) said: I remember (these > words) from Messenger of Allah (Ô∑∫): \\"Give up what is doubtful to you for > that which is not doubtful; for truth is peace of mind and falsehood is > doubt\\".'Riyadh al-Saaliheen, Book 1, Hadith 55 = Maliki view It is considered as haram according to the Sunni Imam Maik ibn Anas.The Lawful And The Prohibited In Islam, Yusuf Al-Qardawi ‚Äì 1997The New Arab Man: Emergent Masculinities, Technologies, and Islam in the Middle East, p 168, Marcia C. Inhorn ‚Äì 2012 It is prohibited all the time according to the Maliki madhhab. At the same, there is a minority opinion within the Maliki school that allows masturbation if done in private and without the use of illicit materials such as pornography and drugs. Shafi'i view It is prohibited all the time according to the Shafi\`i madhhab. Imam Al-Shafi‚Äôi stated that masturbation is forbidden based on the following verses from the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning): > \\"And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual > acts). Except from their wives or that their right hands possess, ‚Äì for > them, they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those > are the transgressors.\\" According to his interpretation, the verses are clear in forbidding all illegal sexual acts (including masturbation) except for the wives or that their right hand possess, and whoever seeks beyond that is the transgressor.. Hanbali view It is generally prohibited according to the Hanbali madhhab, unless one fears adultery or fornication, or is under the desire pressure, in which case, it is permissible to seek a relief through masturbation. According to Ahmad ibn Hanbal, it is permissible for prisoners, travellers and for men and women who have difficulty in finding a lawful spouse. Zahiri view Zahiri Imam Ibn Hazm regards masturbation as permissible. Hanafi view It is not permissible no matter what ===Shi'a view=== Any sexual engagement outside marriage including masturbation is a major sin altogether in the Shi'a Islam. Extra-marital sexual engagement causes the doer to be punished in this life and in the afterlife (qiyama). The Qur'an says, \\"The believers are those who protect their sexual organs except from their spouses... Therefore, whosoever seeks more beyond that (in sexual gratification), then they are the transgressors.\\" (23:5‚Äì6) and it is not allowed in any situation. ===Pro Masturbation View=== The majority of scholars among Muslims forbid masturbation stating that it is an immoral act and argue using the verse in the Quran, \\"And those who guard their private parts save from their wives which their right-hands own ‚Äì so there is no blame upon them. Then whoever seeks beyond that (which is lawful), they are the transgressors.\\" (23: 5‚Äì6)https://aboutislam.net/counseling/ask-the-counselor/addictions/is- masturbation-healthy/ but a new group of young Muslims have started to question and argue this fatwa.

It is the main continuation of the original Rostrum club (\\"The Rostrum\\") founded in Manchester, United Kingdom on 21 July 1923. This club's other surviving descendants are \\"Rochdale Rostrum\\", a Rostrum club in the Greater Manchester area founded in 1978; and the presently dormant \\"Wellington Rostrum Club\\" in New Zealand. Its early establishment makes Rostrum the longest running public speaking organisation in the world. Rostrum clubs aim to help their members improve their speaking and meeting skills. They do this primarily through regular club meetings and less frequent competitions. Australian Rostrum's main national competition for members is the \\"Sidney Wicks Speaking Competition\\". This is held roughly every six to eight years. In other years, state and territory competitions are dominant. Its other main national competition is the annual Rostrum Voice of Youth (VOY). This is open to all high school students. It involves a prepared speech and a short notice speech. ==History1920s=== Rostrum was founded by Sidney F. Wicks.Obituary to Sidney F. Wicks. Manchester Guardian, P11, 14 February 1956 Wicks was an author, an advertising executive for the Manchester Guardian, public relations practitioner Company Director and Newspaper Chief Editor. He came to believe that people needed to think through their own decision-making processes rather than just accept the promotions of the press and other interested parties. On 21 July 1923, he founded a club in Manchester with the prime purpose to encourage men to listen to many sources before formulating their own opinions, and then to speak their minds to groups of others in a way that would encourage them to listen. The club began as an offshoot of the Manchester YMCA Businessmen's Speaking Class.Manchester YMCA Opening for Winter Session 1923‚Äì24, Sidney F. Wicks Special Speaker. The Manchester Guardian, 22 September 1923. Greendale Farm Mottram St Andrew, Yew Tree under which The Rostrum Club was Founded After the first meeting under a yew tree at Greendale Farm near Manchester, meetings for YMCA members were held on Wednesday evenings in the local YMCA building. In 1924 a young Australian Engineer training in Manchester, Alan Crook (later MBE), joined Rostrum while studying at the Victoria University of Manchester. The following year he returned to Australia. ===1930s=== Rostrum Club 1, July 1931 Pilgrimage to Speaker's Rock, Back Row: s c Robertson, C M Purnell, J G Hardman, Stuart McPhee, NC Burgess, Hilton Gordon, R Noble, Robert Swainson, A C Stiles, Edgar Barratt, Fred Seasons. Front Row: Jack Caffin, Charles Claiton, Alan Crook Crook, with the help of Robert Swainson and Stuart McPhee, formed a Rostrum Club in Sydney. It was founded on 21 July 1930, coincidentally exactly seven years after the original club. It was founded under an Angophora tree on the shores of Middle Harbour in Sydney. Alan Crook was the first President and Robert Swainson the Critic. Like the Manchester Club, this was a dinner club. In November 1931, \\"Luncheon Club No.1\\" was formed, Alan Crook again being the first President. \\"No.2 Luncheon Club\\" was formed in July 1932, No.3 in July 1933 and No.4 Club in July 1934. The original club was given the name of \\"Foundation Club\\". In May 1934, Alan Crook went to Melbourne for a holiday and formed a Rostrum Club which a few months later, together with the then five Sydney Clubs, became the first Dais (regional council). Fred Seamons was the first President and held this office for 15 years. A second Rostrum club was formed in Melbourne in July 1935 and the Victorian clubs then formed their own Dais. On the evening of 3 December 1935, George McNicholl, Treasurer of the Melbourne & Metropolitan Board of Works and Chairman of the Australian Institute of Secretaries (AIS), moved a very gracious vote of thanks to a guest speaker from the SA branch of the AIS. Afterwards, some SA residents present asked McNicholl how he became such a good speaker. He told them about Rostrum.TRAINING IN PUBLIC SPEAKING. The Advertiser (Adelaide), P12, 5 December 1935. This discussion lead to the first South Australian meeting. It was held in Adelaide on 18 February 1936 in the inner suburb of North Terrace. In 1937, Alan Crook took a business trip to Brisbane and during this trip, he initiated Queensland's first club on 6 May 1937. By November that year Brisbane's second club was launched. Rostrum Australia was started under an Angophora Tree at the junction of Rocky Creek and Middle Harbour Creek, by Speakers Rock. An Australian Rostrum Council was established on 5 January 1938, bringing together the state Daises. Fred Seamons was the President for the first eight years. Alan Crook served as Secretary for 27 years until his death on 9 August 1965. By the end of the 1930s there were many Rostrum clubs throughout NSW, Victoria, SA and Queensland.Rostrum in Australia 1930‚Äì1965, Alan Milston, Rostrum Australia, 1990 ===1940s=== Victorian Rostrum Clubs held their first conference at Healsville Golf Club in 1940Rostrum Movement.

By this time, there were nearly 100 Rostrum Clubs in Australia. Speaking clubs were not as popular in the UK as in Australia, the main speaking club group there at the time, Toastmasters had only six clubs before World War II.

Following the 2018 season, Stewart signed a one-day contract with Carolina and retired as a Panther. ==High school career== Stewart is the career leading rusher in Washington prep football history. At Timberline High School in Lacey, Washington, from 2001 to 2004, he rushed for 7,755 yards and scored 105 touchdowns. In 2001, as a freshman, he rushed for 1,279 yards on 95 carries (13.5 avg.) and scored 15 touchdowns. In 2002, as a sophomore, despite an ankle injury causing him to miss almost half of the season, he rushed for 1,609 yards on 153 carries (10.5 avg.) and scored 14 touchdowns. As a junior, in 2003, he rushed for 2,566 yards on 285 carries (9.0 avg.) and scored 45 touchdowns.

I'm limited to that factor, but there's a lot to be talked about. If anybody wants to use my beats, I want to maintain my integrity that I have as a person.\\" Jonathan Stewart also spoke with Dubcnn about his music career, stating \\"Music isn't a business for me. I'm not trying to supplement my lifestyle with music. I love music and I play music everyday, whether it's my piano, or making a song. It's the same with football, I get paid well to play football, because I'm blessed to have a lot of skill, but I could never be this good without loving the game... I love to play football as much as I did when I was a kid and played for nothing but love. Music is the same way. God blessed me with gifts for both and I love both, but I don't do music to make money at all. I love music, so why not let people listen to it.\\" ==References * Carolina Panthers bio * Oregon Ducks bio * - Deangelo Williams' and Jonathan Stewart's official website. * NFL Scouting Combine * Seattle Times Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:American football running backs Category:People from Fort Lewis, Washington Category:African-American players of American football Category:Players of American football from Washington (state) Category:Sportspeople from the Seattle metropolitan area Category:Oregon Ducks football players Category:Carolina Panthers players Category:Unconferenced Pro Bowl players Category:People from Lacey, Washington Category:New York Giants players Category:Timberline High School (Lacey, Washington) alumni ","title":"Jonathan Stewart"},{"id":"7451112","text":"Princess Pingyi (È¶ÆÁøäÂÖ¨‰∏ª), later honored as Empress Wenxiang (ÊñáË•ÑÁöáÂêé), formally posthumously honored as Empress Jing (Êï¨ÁöáÂêé, literally \\"the respected empress\\") by Northern Qi, was a princess of the Chinese dynasty Northern Wei and its branch successor state Eastern Wei. She was the sister of Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei, and the wife of Eastern Wei's paramount official Gao Cheng, son of Gao Huan. It is not known when she was born to Yuan Dan (ÂÖÉ‰∫∂) the Prince of Qinghe, a grandson of Emperor Xiaowen, but what is known is that during the reign of Emperor Xiaowu (532-535), she was created the Princess Pingyi. In 534, Emperor Xiaowu, seeking to escape the grasp of Gao Huan, fled west from the capital Luoyang to the domain of the independent general Yuwen Tai. Gao Huan subsequently made her brother Yuan Shanjian emperor (as Emperor Xiaojing), signifying a division of Northern Wei into Eastern Wei (with Emperor Xiaojing as emperor) and Western Wei (with Emperor Xiaowu as emperor). She was subsequently given to Gao Huan's son Gao Cheng as his wife, although the date of the marriage is not known. Princess Pingyi was said to be both beautiful and virtuous. In 541, she bore Gao Cheng a son, Gao Xiaowan (È´òÂ≠ùÁê¨). Emperor Xiaojing personally visited Gao Cheng and her to congratulate them. Later, she also bore him two daughters. Gao Cheng was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (Ëò≠‰∫¨) in 549, and Gao Cheng's brother Gao Yang took over his position of power. In 550, Gao Yang forced Emperor Xiaojing to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and starting Northern Qi (as its Emperor Wenxuan). Emperor Wenxuan honored Gao Cheng as Emperor Wenxiang, and thus honored her as Empress Wenxiang, settling her at Jingde Palace (ÈùúÂæ∑ÂÆÆ). In 555, with Emperor Wenxuan growing increasingly unstable in his mental state, he forced her to move out of Jingde Palace. Further, alleging that Gao Cheng had previously forced his wife Empress Li Zu'e to have sexual relations with Gao Cheng, Emperor Wenxuan forced her to have sexual relations with him. Nothing further concrete was recorded about her in history. She died sometime between 570 and 576, and was buried with Gao Cheng with honors due an empress. == References == * Book of Northern Qi, vol. 9. * History of the Northern Dynasties, vol. 14. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 158, 163.

Gogos was 16 years old when he and his family immigrated to the U.S. Interested in art from a young age, Gogos spent his early adult years working at various jobs and studying art periodically with the goal of eventually becoming a fine artist. Gogos attended several New York area schools including The National School of Design, The Phoenix School of Design and The School of Visual Arts. While attending the Art Students League of New York, Gogos had his greatest artistic growth studying with noted illustrator Frank J. Reilly. After winning a competition at the school sponsored by Pocket Books, Gogos began his professional career with the cover painting for a western paperback novel called Pursuit published in 1959. ==Career== During the 1960s, Gogos provided a steady stream of illustrations for a variety of New York-based publications. The majority of his work during this period was for men's adventure magazines for which he painted many scenes of World War II battles, jungle perils and crime as well as cheesecake portraits of beautiful women. However, Gogos' greatest impact as an illustrator was the work he did for Warren Publishing. Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine, created by publisher James Warren and editor Forrest J Ackerman, premiered in 1958 and was aimed at young readers who were then discovering the classic horror films of the 1930s and 1940s on television. The magazine's covers were usually eye-catching close-ups of horror movie characters. Gogos' first work for Warren was the cover of Famous Monsters of Filmland #9 in 1960 featuring a portrait of Vincent Price from House of Usher painted in shades of red, yellow and green. Over the next two decades, he created almost 50 covers for Famous Monsters, many of which have become iconic images of that period. Gogos also provided cover art for several other Warren magazines including Creepy, Eerie, Spacemen, Wildest Westerns and The Spirit. Gogos' Famous Monsters cover art featured most of the classic horror characters such as The Phantom of the Opera, Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, The Wolf Man, The Mummy, King Kong, Godzilla, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon and popular horror actors like Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Vincent Price, Lon Chaney, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. Gogos often captured his subjects in an array of vivid colors using a technique in which the artist imagined the character bathed in colors from multiple light sources. He enjoyed painting monsters more than most of his more conventional assignments because of the freedom he was given and because of the challenge of painting such unusual characters which he endeavored to portray as both frightening and sympathetic. In the late 1970s, Gogos gave up full-time commercial illustration to devote himself more to his original goal of doing fine art. He produced personal art pieces in watercolor and other media, while earning his livelihood as a photo retouch artist in the ad department of United Artists. While there, he also did occasional illustrations for movie posters. Gogos later moved into advertising where he produced presentation sketches and storyboards for commercials for a major ad agency. Due to a resurgence of interest in classic horror films and collectibles, Gogos returned to the horror genre in the 1990s. During this time, new Gogos monster portraits appeared on trading cards, lithographs and the covers of Monsterscene magazine. He has also painted CD covers for rock stars Rob Zombie, The Misfits and Electric Frankenstein. In 2005 Vanguard Productions published the coffee table book, Famous Monster Movie Art of Basil Gogos by Kerry Gammill and J. David Spurlock. ==Death== Gogos died in Manhattan on September 13, 2017, at age 88. ==Awards== In 2006 Gogos was inducted to the Monster Kid Hall Of Fame at The Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards for his contributions to the field of classic horror.The Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Awards ==References *BasilGogos.net *Gogos At VANGUARD * - Facebook posting from Rob Zombie on Basil's passing (15/09/2017) *Basil's Legacy Rue Morgue Category:1929 births Category:2017 deaths Category:American illustrators Category:Film poster artists Category:Horror artists Category:Greek Orthodox Christians from Egypt Category:American people of Greek descent Category:Science fiction artists ","title":"Basil Gogos"},{"id":"7451206","text":"Sugar Creek Township is one of the sixteen townships of Wayne County, Ohio, United States.

He jumps on the bed, then uses a tube of toothpaste to put stripes on the cat. When Betty catches him, she tells him a fairy tale about a naughty boy. The boy in the story ties a can on a tail of a puppy resembling Pudgy the Puppy, scares a hen and prematurely frees her chick, shakes apples off a tree and cuts it down, throws bricks at a greenhouse, knocks clean laundry into the mud, and shaves the hair off a barber. When he teases a lion at a nearby circus by taking its bone out of its cage, the lion escapes its cage and the boy has to be rescued by a magic fairy (Betty Boop with fairy wings, wearing a star-covered black evening dress). The fairy rescues the little boy but makes him promise to undo all his mischief. This is done rather easily by the animators reversing the sequence of scenes from the first part of the story. Junior is not certain that he believes the story, but at last he is ready to go to sleep and undoes his mischief with the same reversal of sequences, and hides under the covers in fear, likely because of the lion. ==References * Baby Be Good on Youtube * * Category:1935 films Category:American animated short films Category:English-language films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:Betty Boop cartoons Category:1930s American animated films Category:1935 animated films Category:Paramount Pictures short films Category:Fleischer Studios short films Category:Short films directed by Dave Fleischer ","title":"Baby Be Good"},{"id":"7451268","text":"The San Elizario Salt War, also known as the Salinero Revolt or the El Paso Salt War, was an extended and complex range war of the mid-19th century that revolved around the ownership and control of immense salt lakes at the base of the Guadalupe Mountains in West Texas. What began in 1866 as a political and legal struggle among Anglo Texan politicians and capitalists gave rise in 1877 to an armed struggle by ethnic Mexican and Tejano inhabitants living on both sides of the Rio Grande near El Paso against a leading politician, who was supported by the Texas Rangers. The struggle reached its climax with the siege and surrender of 20 Texas Rangers to a popular army of perhaps 500 men in the town of San Elizario, Texas. The arrival of the African-American 9th Cavalry and a sheriff's posse of New Mexico mercenaries caused hundreds of Tejanos to flee to Mexico, some in permanent exile. The right of individuals to own the salt lakes, which had previously been held as a community asset, was established by force of arms. The conflict began as a local quarrel and grew in stages to finally occupy the attention of both the Texas and federal governments. Newspaper editors throughout the nation covered the story, often with frenzied tone and in lurid detail. At the conflict's height, as many as 650 men bore arms. About 20 to 30 men were killed in the 12-year fight for salt, and perhaps double that number were wounded.\\"The El Paso Salt War: A Review of the Historical Literature\\", Paul Cool, Journal of Big Bend Studies, Vol. 17, 2005, pp. 49‚Äì50. Traditionally, the uprising of Mexican-Americans during the San Elizario Salt War has been described by historians as a bloody riot by a howling mob. The Texas Rangers who surrendered, especially their commander, have been described as unfit.Walter Prescott Webb, The Texas Rangers: A Century of Frontier Defense, University of Texas Press, 1965 (1935), pp. 351‚Äì367; C. L. Sonnichsen, The El Paso Salt War of 1877, Carl Hertzog and the Texas Western Press, 1961, pp. 27‚Äì57. More recent scholarship has placed the war within the context of the long and often violent social struggle of Mexican-Americans to be treated as equal citizens in the United States and not as a subjugated people.Oscar J. Martinez, Troublesome Border, University of Arizona Press, 1995, pp. 85‚Äì86. Most recently, the \\"mob\\" has been described as an organized political-military insurgency with the goal of re-establishing local control of their fundamental political rights and economic future.Paul Cool, Salt Warriors: Insurgency on the Rio Grande, Texas A&M; University Press, 2008, pp. 1‚Äì5, 131‚Äì134. ==BackgroundNational ambiguity=== The Rio Grande is a natural barrier in West Texas. Long before claims to the region were made by Anglo-Americans, Spanish colonials and later Mexicans settled a series of communities along the south banks of the river, which provided protection from Comanche and Apache raids from the north. Prior to major water-control projects on the Rio Grande such as Elephant Butte Dike, which was constructed in the early 20th century, the river flooded often. San Elizario was a relatively large community south of the river from its founding in 1789 until an 1829 flood changed the course of the river, leaving San Elizario on \\"La Isla\\", a new island between the new and old channels of the Rio Grande. This position relative to the river became more important in 1836, when the newly independent Republic of Texas proclaimed the Rio Grande as the southern border of the new country. The nationality of the people of San Elizario was disputed until the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, which ended the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and identified the \\"deepest channel\\", i.e. the southern channel, as the official international boundary. The status of San Elizario was further made official by the 1853 treaty that sold the territory of the Gadsden Purchase to the United States. At that time, San Elizario was the largest US community between San Antonio, Texas, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was a major stop on the Camino Real and was the county seat of the region. ===Civil War and Reconstruction=== The American Civil War created great changes in the political landscape of West Texas. The end of the war and Reconstruction brought many entrepreneurs to the area. The families of San Elizario had deep roots and were loath to accept the newcomers. Many Republicans settled in the small community of Franklin, Texas, a trading village across the Rio Grande from the Chihuahua city of El Paso del Norte (present-day Ciudad Ju√°rez). By the beginning of the 1870s, the Democratic Party had begun to reclaim political influence in the state. The Democratic operatives, with their ties to the Southern United States, were not accepted by the people of San Elizario either, as they retained generational ties to Mexico. Alliances shifted and rivalries developed between the Hispanic, Republican and Democratic factions in West Texas. ===Salt=== At the base of the Guadalupe Mountains, about northeast of San Elizario, lie a series of dry saline lakes (located at ). Before the pumping of water and oil from West Texas, the area had a periodic shallow water table, and capillary action drew salt of a high purity to the surface. This salt was valuable for a wide variety of purposes, including preserving meats and replenishing what sweating took from humans and animals. Its value made it a commodity used for barter along El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro and was an essential element in the patio process for extracting silver from ore in Chihuahua mines. Historically, caravans to the salt lakes traveled either down the Rio Grande and then straight north or via what became the Butterfield Overland Mail route. In 1863, the people of San Elizario, as a community, built by subscription a road running east to the salt lakes. Early residents of the Rio Grande valley at El Paso were granted community access rights to these lakes by the King of Spain, and these rights were later grandfathered in by the Republic of Mexico and in accordance with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Beginning in 1866, the Texas Constitution allowed individuals to stake claims for mineral rights, thus overturning the traditional community rights. ==Political phase, 1866‚Äì1877== In 1870, a group of influential leaders from Franklin claimed the land on which the salt deposits were found. They were unsuccessful in gaining sole title to the land, and a feud over its ownership and control began. William Wallace MillsWilliam Wallace Mills, W.W. Mills (1901) Forty Years at El Paso (1858-1898) HTML table of contents: pp. 9-10 favored individual private ownership, Louis Cardis favored the Hispanic community concept of commonwealth, and Albert Jennings Fountain favored county government ownership with community access. This led Cardis and Fountain to join together as the so-called \\"Anti-Salt ring\\", while Mills became the leader of the opposing \\"Salt ring\\". Fountain was elected to the Texas State Senate and began pushing for his plan of county government ownership with community access. San Elizario's Spanish priest, Father Antonio Borrajo, opposed the plan and gained the support of Cardis. On December 7, 1870, Judge Gaylord J. Clarke, a supporter of Mills, was killed. Fountain and Cardis sparred with every political and legal tool at their command. The Republicans' loss of state government control in 1873 prompted Fountain to leave El Paso for his wife's home in the New Mexico Territory. In 1872, Charles Howard, a Virginian by birth, came to the region determined to restore the Democratic Party to power in West Texas. His natural rival was Mills, so he struck up an alliance with Cardis, who was influential with Hispanic voters in the region. Cardis had a stronger allegiance to the former citizens of Mexico than to either US political party, and was influential in swinging their votes in any direction he thought beneficial to the community or to himself. Howard was elected district judge and about the same time began feuding with Cardis over who would be the county's political \\"top dog\\".Charles H. Howard was long reported to have been a native of Missouri, but Virginia has now been established as his birthplace. See Sonnichsen, The El Paso Salt War of 1877, p. 1; \\"Charles H. Howard\\", Handbook of Texas. For Howard's political career in El Paso, see Cool, Salt Warriors, pp. 57‚Äì78. In the summer of 1877, Howard filed a claim for the salt lakes in the name of his father-in-law, George B. Zimpelman, an Austin capitalist. Howard offered to pay any salinero who collected salt the going rate for its retrieval, but he insisted the salt was his. The Tejanos of San Elizario, encouraged by Father Borrajo (by now the former pastor), with the support of Cardis, gathered and kept salt in spite of Howard's claim. The people did not look only to outside leaders. Falling back on a long tradition of local self-government, they formed committees (juntas) in San Elizario and the largely Tejano neighboring towns of Socorro and Ysleta, Texas, to determine a community-based response to Howard's actions. During the summer of 1877, they held several secretive, decisional, and organizational meetings.Cool, Salt Warriors, pp. 83‚Äì85. ==Armed uprising, 1877‚Äì1878== On September 29, 1877, Jos√© Mari√° Ju√°rez and Macedonia Gandara threatened to collect a wagonload of salt. When Howard learned of their activities, he had the men arrested by El Paso County Sheriff Charles Kerber and went to court in San Elizario that evening to legally restrain them. A faction of armed men arrested the compliant jurist, however, and others went in search of Howard, locating him at Sheriff Kerber's home in Yselta. Under the leadership of Francisco \\"Chico\\" Barela, they seized Howard and marched him back to San Elizario. For three days, he was held prisoner by several hundred men, led by Sisto Salcido, Lino Granillo, and Barela. On October 3, he was finally released upon payment of a $12,000 bond and his written relinquishment of all rights to the salt deposits. Howard left for Mesilla, New Mexico, where he briefly stayed at the home of Fountain. He soon returned to the area, and on October 10, shot and killed Cardis in an El Paso (formerly Franklin) mercantile store. Howard fled back to New Mexico. The Tejano people of El Paso County were outraged. They effectively put a stop to all county government, replacing it with community juntas and daring the sheriff to take any action against them. In response to pleas from a frightened Anglo community (numbering fewer than 100 residents out of nearly 5,000 in the county), Governor of Texas Richard B. Hubbard answered by sending Major John B. Jones, commander of the Texas Rangers' Frontier Battalion, to El Paso. Arriving on November 5, Jones met with the junta leaders, negotiated their agreement to obey the law, and arranged Howard's return, arraignment, and release on bail. Jones also recruited 20 new Texas Rangers, the Detachment of Company C, under the command of Lieutenant John B. Tays, a native Canadian. Traditionally, Tays has been described as an uneducated handyman, but later research indicated he was a mining engineer, El Paso land speculator, and smuggler of Mexican cattle. His appointment to command the local Ranger detachment was approved by leading Anglos. The Ranger detachment recruited by Jones and Tays was mixed, composed of Anglos and a few Tejanos, including an old Indian fighter, several Civil War veterans, an experienced lawman, at least one outlaw, and a few community pillars. Individually, they included some capable men, but the unit lacked tradition or cohesion.For traditional and revisionist views of Tays, see Webb, The Texas Rangers, p. 367; Sonnichsen, The El Paso Salt War of 1877, p. 38; Cool, Salt Warriors, pp. 142‚Äì143. On December 12, 1877, Howard returned to San Elizario with a company of 20 Texas Rangers led by Tays. Once again, a group of armed insurgents descended upon them. Howard and the Rangers took cover in the buildings, eventually taking refuge in the town's church. After a two-day siege, Tays surrendered the company of Rangers, marking the only time in history a Texas Ranger unit ever surrendered to adversaries. Howard, Ranger Sergeant John McBride, and merchant and ex-police lieutenant John G. Atkinson were immediately executed and their bodies hacked and dumped into a well. The Rangers were disarmed and sent out of town. The civic leaders of San Elizario fled to Mexico, and the people of the town looted the buildings. In all, 12 people were killed and 50 wounded. ==Legacy== Besides the many casualties, the war cost an estimated $31,050 in property damage. Additionally, many crop losses were sustained because local farmers did not till or harvest their fields for several months; loss of wheat crops alone was estimated at $48,000. To these immediate financial losses (collectively ) can be added the further political and economic marginalization of the Mexican-American community of El Paso County.\\"The El Paso Salt War: A Review of the Historical Literature, Journal of Big Bend Studies, Vol. 17, 2005, pp. 49‚Äì50. As a result of the unrest, San Elizario lost its status as county seat, which was relocated to the growing town of El Paso. The 9th Cavalry of Buffalo Soldiers were sent to re-establish Fort Bliss to keep an eye on the border and the local Mexican population. When the railroad came to West Texas in 1883, it bypassed San Elizario. The town's population decreased, and ethnic Mexicans lost much of their political influence in the region. ==Bibliography== * The Texas Rangers: A Century of Frontier Defense, Walter Prescott Webb, 1965 (1935), University of Texas Press. * The El Paso Salt War of 1877, C.

It was founded in 1930 in Montreal by Alex Wisehttps://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc- csc/en/item/2184/index.do and constituted on March 31, 1949 as Wise Stores inc. It expanded outside of Quebec by opening its first stores in the Maritimes provinces in 1986 and eventually Ontario in 1988. In 1992, the company acquired the even longer running and competitor Peoples department stores from British retailer Marks & Spencer. Under the terms of the purchase, the Wise and Peoples chains could not completely merge until the outstanding balance owed to Marks & Spencer for the transaction had completely been paid in full. Because of this restriction, Peoples was instead operated as a subsidiary of Wise.http://www.degrandprechait.com/en/publications- litigation/80-directors-were-not-responsible-for-the-bankruptcy-of-people- department-stores-inc Wise was basically a discount department retailer with store dimensions averaging those of Hart, Greenberg and Peoples; in contrast to the larger-sized Zellers, Woolco and Kmart. Wise created in June 1993 a larger liquidation stores chain under the banner Wizmart. At its peak, the company operated five divisions: Wise Stores inc. (48 stores), Peoples Stores inc. (178 stores), Wizmart, KLHR Liquidation, and NRMA. In 1994, the company shuttered 13 underperforming Wise and Wizmart stores.Wise Stores Inc closes 13 stores. Peoples declared bankruptcy on January 13, 1995 while Wise avoided it but would still get liquidated anyway. Wise eventually went bankrupt too on January 31, 1995. Wise's incapacity of paying the amount it owed Marks & Spencer for the Peoples acquisition was the main reason for the demise of both chains. The original Wise store, located on 6751 St-Hubert street in the La Petite-Patrie neighbourhood, operated throughout the entire 65 years of the company. Its founder Alex Wise was with the company for practically its whole existence and was still president in 1994 though he was retired by the time it went bankrupt in 1995.

Enlarge The Whitefriars Theatre was a theatre in Jacobean London, in existence from 1608 to the 1620s ‚Äî about which only limited and sometimes contradictory information survives. ==Location== The Whitefriars district was outside the medieval city walls of London to the west; it took its name from the priory of Carmelite monks (\\"white friars\\" due to their characteristic robes) that had existed there before Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. Until 1608 the Whitefriars district was a liberty of the City, beyond the direct control of the Lord Mayor and the aldermen; as such, it tended to attract the elements of society that had an interest in resisting authority. Like actors: there is a single reference to a theatre in Whitefriars that was suppressed sometime in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. ==Theatre== In 1608, Michael Drayton and Thomas Woodford, nephew of the playwright, Thomas Lodge, leased the mansion house of the old priory from Lord Buckhurst, for a term of seven years. They constructed what was then called a \\"private\\" theatre (as opposed to the large open-air \\"public\\" theatres like the Globe) in the refectory or hall of the building. The new theatre was occupied at first by the King's Revels Children during that company's brief life. In 1609 their place was taken by the Children of the Queen's Revels; that company acted Nathan Field's play A Woman is a Weathercock there, as well as Ben Jonson's Epicene, George Chapman's The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois, Beaumont and Fletcher's The Scornful Lady, John Marston's The Insatiate Countess, and Robert Daborne's A Christian Turn'd Turk.Munro, p. 25. The Queen's Revels Children were joined in 1613 by the Lady Elizabeth's Men. The intention may have been for the combined company to use the Whitefriars as its winter playhouse and the Swan Theatre as a summer venue, as the King's Men did with the Blackfriars Theatre and the Globe.R. A. Foakes, \\"Playhouses and players,\\" in Braunmuller and Hattaway, p. 30. But Philip Rosseter, the manager of the Queen's Revels company, lost his lease on the Whitefriars in 1614 and was unable to renew it. The combined company split again, and by October 1614 the Lady Elizabeth's Men were at the newly opened Hope Theatre south of the Thames. In 1615 the Queen's Revels players moved to Rosseter's short-lived Porter's Hall Theatre and then passed out of existence. After that point, the story of the Whitefriars Theatre grows obscure; Prince Charles's Men may have used the theatre, though they were also acting at the Hope. A 1616 reference pictures the place as poorly furnished and suffering from rain damage. In 1621 the building's then-current landlord, Sir Anthony Ashley, \\"turned out the players.\\"Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 515-17. ==Replacement== In 1629 the Whitefriars was replaced by the Salisbury Court Theatre, which was located across Water Lane (now the southern end of Whitefriars St) from the Whitefriars, where the KPMG headquarters now stands. Salisbury Court was named after the medieval house and garden of the Bishops of Salisbury, which stood on the east side of Water Lane.Clapham, p. 17 and fig. facing. To add an element of posthumous confusion, the Salisbury Court Theatre was sometimes referred to as the Whitefriars in later years, as in the 1660s diary of Samuel Pepys. The site of the Whitefriars priory is now occupied by the offices of Freshfields; a fragment of the priory cellars has been excavated and moved to a basement that can be viewed from Magpie Alley. ==NotesReferences== * Braunmuller, A.

However, the collapse of the Romanov dynasty, followed by the Bolshevik Revolution and the Japanese Siberian Intervention created a strong distrust between Japan and the newly founded Soviet Union. ==Signing== The treaty was signed by Lev Mikhailovich Karakhan of the Soviet Union and Kenkichi Yoshizawa of Japan on 20 January 1925. ==Terms== Following a series of negotiations held in Beijing in 1924 and 1925, Japan agreed to extend diplomatic recognition to the Soviet Union and to withdraw its troops from the northern half of Sakhalin island. In return, the Soviet Union agreed to honor the provisions of the Treaty of Portsmouth and to re-examine all other treaties between the former Russian Empire and Japan, including the Fishery Convention of 1907. ==Notes * Text of the convention Category:Treaties of the Soviet Union Category:Japan‚ÄìSoviet Union relations Category:1925 in Japan Category:1925 in the Soviet Union Category:Japan‚ÄìRussia relations Category:Treaties concluded in 1925 Category:Treaties of the Empire of Japan Category:Japan‚ÄìRussia treaties ","title":"Soviet‚ÄìJapanese Basic Convention"},{"id":"7451382","text":"Arthur von Hippel may refer to: * Arthur R. von Hippel (1898‚Äì2003), German American materials scientist and physicist * Arthur von Hippel (physician) (1841‚Äì1916), German ophthalmologist ","title":"Arthur von Hippel"},{"id":"7451393","text":"Ambriel is an angel who is associated with the sun sign of Gemini and the month of May.\\"Today's Horoscope\\", New York Daily News, November 9, 2006 Catholicism regards an angel as a pure spirit created by God and this angel inspires clear communication and is also considered to be an angel of general protection.

He played college football at Ohio State University. ==Early years== Springs attended Lafayette High School, where he played football alongside Hall of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor, and one of the best return specialists in NFL history in Mel Gray. As a senior in 1974, he rushed for a then-Peninsula District-record 1,876 yards, including 315 yards in one game. In 1975, he enrolled at Coffeyville Community College to improve his grades. As a freshman, he rushed for 1,800 yards and 25 touchdowns. He was named Junior College player of the year. The following year, he transferred to Ohio State University to play under head coach Woody Hayes. Playing behind Jeff Logan, he registered 389 rushing yards (fourth on the team), a 5.4-yard average and two [touchdowns.

He had runs of 72 yards against Northwestern University and 66 yards against Purdue University. He was the last Buckeye with less than 100 yards receiving on a season to lead the team in receptions. Springs was elected a team co-captain as a senior. He was limited with a knee injury he suffered in the third game against Baylor University. He collected 585 rushing yards (third on the team), a 4.7-yard average and two touchdowns. He finished his college career with 2,140 rushing yards, 11 rushing touchdowns, and 168 receiving yards. He also ran sprint relays for the track team. In 2003, he was among the first inductees into the Lafayette High School Athletic Hall of Fame. ==Professional careerDallas Cowboys=== Springs was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the 5th round (136th overall) of the 1979 NFL Draft, after he dropped because of a poor senior year. As a rookie, he was the backup for Tony Dorsett and played on special teams. In the season-opener 22‚Äì21 win against the St. Louis Cardinals, he rushed for 30 yards, had 2 catches and threw a 30-yard touchdown pass to Tony Hill in the fourth quarter. He scored two touchdowns against the San Francisco 49ers. In the fifteenth game 24‚Äì7 win against the Philadelphia Eagles, he took Dorsett's place late in the first half and rushed for 62 yards (49 in the second half), helping the Cowboys clinched a playoff berth. In the dramatic comeback victory in the season finale 35‚Äì34 victory against the Washington Redskins, he rushed for 79 yards and one touchdown, had 6 catches for 58 yards, including a 26-yard touchdown reception late in the fourth-quarter rally, helping the team win the NFC East championship. In 1980, he put on 10 pounds during the off-season and won the fullback job from Robert Newhouse, but suffered a twisted ankle in the third game and lost the starter position. In 1981, he was the full-time starter at fullback, combining for 984 yards rushing and receiving, scoring 12 touchdowns (led the team) and tied Tony Hill for the club lead with 46 catches (one short of the franchise record for a running backs). Although his most important role might have been his leadership qualities, that gained him the respect of many people within the Cowboys organization. He set a franchise record for running backs with 11 receptions against the New England Patriots. He had a 32-yard reception late in the fourth quarter for the winning touchdown in a 28‚Äì27 comeback win against the Miami Dolphins. In 1982, in the strike-shortened season (9 games), he registered 243 rushing yards, 2 rushing touchdowns, 163 receiving yards and 2 receiving touchdowns. In the Cowboys' 24‚Äì10 win against the Washington Redskins, he had an 8-yard touchdown reception in the first half and a 46-yard touchdown run in the final minutes. In 1983, he led the NFL running backs in receiving and set a franchise record with 73 receptions, breaking Frank Clarke's mark of 65. He also combined for more than 1,000 yards (1,130) rushing and receiving. Against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he tied his club record with 11 receptions for a career-high 126 receiving yards, including a career-long 80-yard touchdown reception. Against the Oakland Raiders, he threw his second career touchdown pass, a 15-yarder to quarterback Danny White. In 1984, he posted 46 catches for 454 yards, including three long touchdown receptions. He had a 25-yard touchdown catch to help beat the Philadelphia Eagles 23‚Äì17, a 26-yard reception for the winning touchdown in a 24‚Äì17 victory against the St. Louis Cardinals and a 57-yard touchdown reception in the 26‚Äì10 win against the Philadelphia Eagles. On September 2, 1985, he was released, leaving as the Cowboys' seventh all-time leading rusher and receiver. Springs was primarily a blocking back for Hall of Famer Tony Dorsett, but he got plenty of opportunities to run and catch in head coach Tom Landry's multiple set offense. In this system he thrived as a versatile player who could run, catch, block, and occasionally even throw the option pass. ===Tampa Bay Buccaneers=== On September 16, 1985, he was signed as a free agent by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he played his final two seasons serving as a backup to running back James Wilder Sr. He wasn't re-signed after the 1986 season and retired, having played in the NFL for 8 years. His career totals were 2,519 yards rushing with 28 touchdowns and 249 receptions for 2,259 yards and 10 touchdowns. ==Personal life== Springs was the father of NFL cornerback Shawn Springs. ==Health concerns and death== Springs was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 1990, which led to his having both his right foot and two toes from the left foot amputated. In 2004, needing a kidney, he was placed on the national transplant list. Though his son, Shawn Springs, offered to end his career and donate a kidney, Ron Springs refused. In 2006, former teammate and best friend Everson Walls agreed to donate one of his kidneys, and the transplant took place in March. On October 16, 2007, it was reported that Springs entered into a coma after going into cardiac arrest while having an operation performed on an elbow cyst the previous weekend. He remained in this state until his death, and his son left his team to be with his father during that time. Doctors reported in 2007 that there was no chance of Springs surviving; however, his family continued encouraging him by talking to him daily. On January 5, 2008, former Cowboy teammate Bill Bates held a charity event to help raise funds for the foundation connected with Spring's illness. On January 21, 2008, Springs's wife filed a lawsuit on behalf of her husband against the two doctors who performed the surgery, alleging malpractice. Springs died on May 12, 2011, due to a heart attack. ==References== Category:1956 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Williamsburg, Virginia Category:Players of American football from Virginia Category:American football running backs Category:Coffeyville Red Ravens football players Category:Ohio State Buckeyes men's track and field athletes Category:Ohio State Buckeyes football players Category:Dallas Cowboys players Category:Tampa Bay Buccaneers players Category:Kidney transplant recipients Category:People with type 2 diabetes ","title":"Ron Springs"},{"id":"7451442","text":"Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies, (, Machon Schechter) located in the Neve Granot neighborhood of Jerusalem, is an academic institution affiliated with Conservative Judaism. ==History== Founded in 1984 by the Jewish Theological Seminary (N.Y.) and Israel's Masorti Movement as a rabbinical seminary known as \\"The Seminary of Judaic Studies,\\" the Schechter Institute has been located since 1990 in Neve Granot, a neighborhood behind the Israel Museum.

The NHSA sanctioned and/or sponsored footbag tournaments in the U.S., including the \\"Footbag Nationals\\" which evolved into the World Footbag Championships, an event that it has been running annually since 1980. In 1984, the NHSA ceased to exist, and the World Footbag Association (WFA) was formed in Golden, Colorado, by Bruce Guettich and Greg Cortopassi. The WFA started as a governing body, but soon evolved into a touring team, magazine publisher, and footbag product retailer (via a mail-order catalog business). WFA formed the International Footbag Advisory Board (IFAB) to oversee the official Rules of Footbag Sports (the printed rule-book for the sport of footbag). WFA also took on the task of running the World Footbag Championships from 1984 through 1993. The World-Wide Footbag Foundation, Inc., was incorporated as a California non-profit corporation for public benefit in 1994 by Steve Goldberg, Julie Symons, Brent Welch, and David Butcher. That year, WWFF became the official host of the World Footbag Championships which moved from Colorado to San Francisco and Menlo Park, California. From then on, the World Footbag Championships began moving from city to city as the official WWFF sanctioning process was put in place to provide a set of selection criteria and to decide which host city would be accepted each year. Also in 1994, the WWFF created and began hosting the Footbag WorldWide Information Service. The IFAB continued under the auspices of the WFA for several years, and WFA continued to serve as the official sanctioning body for footbag events during that time. In 2000, the WWFF changed its name to the International Footbag Players' Association, Inc. (IFPA) to better reflect its mission as a player-run volunteer organization and international governing body for the sport of footbag. At that time, the IFAB (which had been the rules body for the sport) reincorporated as a committee of the IFPA and was renamed the International Footbag Committee (IFC). The IFC took over responsibility for defining requirements for IFPA sanctioning and recognition of official footbag competition formats. An IFC rule book is available in several languages. IFPA was granted provisional 501(c)(3) status by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in early 2001, and was granted permanent charitable status under 501(c)(3) as a sports organization in early 2006. ==IFPA's mission== IFPA's mission is to promote footbag as a healthy, athletic activity, by fostering footbag competitions, clubs, festivals, and education around the globe. In addition to overseeing the World Footbag Championships from year to year, IFPA continues to run its web-based resource for footbag players and aficionados worldwide at footbag.org. ==External links== * Footbag WorldWide‚Äînon-profit information service for the sport of footbag * IFC Rules of Footbag Sports‚Äîmultilingual Category:501(c)(3) organizations Category:International sports organizations Category:Outdoor recreation organizations Category:Sports governing bodies Category:Sports organizations established in 1994 ","title":"International Footbag Players' Association"},{"id":"7451482","text":"Boulder City Municipal Airport is a public use airport located one nautical mile (2 km) southwest of the central business district of Boulder City, in Clark County, Nevada, United States.

He was born on September 28, 1897 and raised in Semey (Kaskabulak). Auezov's writings were influenced by the poet Abai. Mukhtar's father and grandfather Omarkhan Auez both highly revered the poet, who was a neighbour and a friend of the Auezov family. His grandfather was a storyteller of folk tales, and taught his grandson to read and write.Mukhtar Auezov. The path of Abai. //Republic of Kazakhstan, Almaty: \\"Zhazushy\\",2009. ‚Äî pages 366‚Äì374. ‚Äî . == Life and family == Auezov was born in a nomadic family from an area known today as Abay District, in East Kazakhstan Province. His grandfather taught him how to read and write. Auezov was educated at the Semipalatinsk Teacher's Seminary and Leningrad State University. Auezov is best known for his plays. The first play he authored was Enlik-Kebek, a story of two young lovers that resembles the story of Romeo and Juliet. He authored more than twenty plays that dealt with the issues relevant to Socialism in Kazakhstan. After writing plays, Auezov changed his focus to writing novels. Two novels ‚Äì Abay and The Path of Abay ‚Äì dealing with the life of Kazakh poet Abay Qunanbayuli were the product of the last twenty years of his life.Iraj Bashiri, Biographies: Central Asia and Iran Auezov's other projects included drawing and translating literature into the Kazakh language. Some translations made by him include Nikolai Gogol's The Government Inspector and Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Mukhtar first studied in Kaskabulak, then later a Muslim madrasa in Semipalatinsk. At age of eleven, he moved to a nearby, five-year grammar school. His father Omarkhan died in 1900, and his mother Nurzhamal in 1912. The young Mukhtar was raised by his uncle Kasymbek and his grandfather Auez and grandmother Dinas. In 1907, after a year of study in the madrasa, he was sent to the large Russian school in Semipalatinsk. Mukhtar Auezov attended the Semipalatinsk Pedagogical Seminary after graduating from the City College. In the 1912‚Äì1913 academic year, Mukhtar finished the first seminary class with an award and went on to complete his studies at the Semipalatinsk Seminary in 1919. Around this time he began his acquaintance with Russian and other foreign classics of literature. At the same time, Auezov wrote short stories, poems and articles that began to be published. \\"The young Auezov, according to the testimonies of the pedagogues, was marked for his impeccable attention, extraordinary gifts, slim build and aristocratic self-belief. He was an extraordinary sportsman and represented ‚ÄúYarysh F C‚Äù, which at the time was the best football team in the city.\\"Mukhtar Auezov Fund. The autobiography and letters Mukhtar Auezov joined the faculty of a large state school, and he also worked holding various positions in the local government in Semipalatinsk with the Kazakh Central Executive Committee and in Orenburg. In the summer of 1917, Auezov married a 15-year-old girl named Raihan. They had a daughter together in 1918 who they named Mugamilya (she lived until 2009), and a year later, in 1919, a son (who died in infancy). They got divorced in 1920. In 1928 Mukhtar Auezov graduated from the Philological Faculty of Leningrad State University and completed his PhD at the University of Tashkent. During the 1930s, his endeavors as a professional writer began to take off. Mukhtar Auezov died during an operation in Moscow on 27 June 1961. He was buried in the Central Cemetery, Almaty. On his grave there stands a bust created by Yevgeny Vuchetich. After his death in 1961, the Government of the Republic Kazakhstan decided to perpetuate the name of the writer. The Institute of Literature and Art of the Academy of Sciences was renamed as the Auezov Institute of Literature and Art of the Academy of Sciences. Kazakh State Academic Drama Theatre, a literary memorial museum, a school, a street and an urban area in Almaty also bear his name. == Writings == Auezov wrote numerous essays, short stories, and plays (many translated into other languages) in different genres. In 1917, while he was studying at the seminary, he wrote ‚ÄúEnilik-Kebek\\" (a play based on folk legends). The \\"Enilik-Kebek\\" play and the story \\"Korgansyzdyn Kuni\\", which was written in 1921 demonstrated to the world his great talent as a writer. From 1923 he began to devote all his energy to the literary arts and to work productively. In the period 1923‚Äì1926 he authored stories such as \\"Okygan azamat\\", \\"Kyr suretteri\\", \\"Uilenu\\", \\"Eskilik kolenkesinde\\", \\"Kinamshil boizhetken\\", \\"Karaly sulu\\". During the period 1923‚Äì1928 years he studied and then graduated from Leningrad University in the Faculty of Language and Literature. During the last two years of his studies In Leningrad (St. Petersburg), he wrote two highly acclaimed novels: \\"Karash-karash\\" and \\"Kokserek\\". Auezov began working in depth with themes of Kazakh history. His fixation with history is demonstrated in his works \\"Enilik-Kebek\\", \\"Khan Kene\\", \\"Kily zmaan\\", \\"Aiman ‚Äì Sholpan\\", and \\"Karakypshak Kobylandy.\\" For 20 years he devoted himself to prose and plays, which have become classics of Kazakh literature. In the thirties, he wrote a series of stories, such as: \\"Kasennin kubylystary\\", \\"Izder\\", \\"Shatkalan\\", \\"Kum men Askar\\", \\"Burtkiwi\\", and plays like\\" Aiman- Sholpan\\", \\"Tas tilek\\", \\"Shekarada\\", \\"Tungi saryn\\". In 1936 he published a piece of prose called \\"Tatiananyn kyrdagy ani\\" in the Kazakh press \\"Kazak adebieti\\", that was a section from the future novel of the same name. Some years after that(around 1940), with the cooperation of Leonid Sobolev, he wrote the \\"Abai\\" tragedy. The great scientist and teacher, Auezov, worked on the history of Kazakhs literature, and the training of personnel. He was the founder of the Abai studies and the principal author and editor of the multivolume \\"Kazak adebiet Tarihy\\". He also wrote a monograph on the Kyrgyz epic Manas. After the Abai Joly epic, he began writing a new, large-scale epic that described a new era in the future. His first book of that period is called \\"Osken orken\\" and was first published posthumously in 1962. A period of blooming of Kazakh drama is associated with the works of Auezov. He wrote over twenty plays and translated such classic works of world and Russian drama as \\"The Inspector\\" by Gogol, Othello and The Taming of the Shrew 'by Shakespeare, Aristocrats by Nikolai Pogodin, Spring Love by Konstantin Trenyov, and Officer of the Navy by A. Kron. In 1960, together with a group of Soviet writers, he visited the United States. In the summer of 1960, he started work on the series of essays named ‚ÄúThe American Impressions‚Äù. From mid-summer 1960, he began work on the novel named ‚ÄúThe Young Tribe‚Äù. In March 1961, Auezov embarked on a visit to India that included participation in the work of the III International Congress for Peace in Delhi together with a delegation headed by Nikolai Tikhonov. In June of that same year, he planned to visit England, the land of Shakespeare, but his untimely death meant that his wish to travel to England did not occur. On June 3, 1961, he travelled to Moscow for medical tests. On June 27, 1961 ‚Äì his heart failed during a surgical operation.Mukhtar Auezov. The path of Abai. The//Republic of Kazakhstan, Almaty: \\"Zhazushy\\",2009. ‚Äî pages 366‚Äì374. ‚Äî . == \\"Abai Zholy\\" (The path of Abai) == In his formative years, Mukhtar listened to the memories of his grandfather that told of Abai and Kunanbay. The destiny of Mukhtar Auezov was linked by many threads to the life of Abai the hero great inspiration of his life. Abai himself graced family celebrations, arranged for Auez to mark the birth of his grandson. Nurganym, one of the wives of Kunanbai father of Abai, was the sister of Auez. Mukhtar later became friends with the son of Abai Turagulom and married Camille, granddaughter of the great poet, that is the daughter of Magauov. Auezov met Dilda, the first wife of Abai with whom he received a great deal of information. More information about Abai was forthcoming from Eigerim another of Abai‚Äôs life partners who survived her husband for more than a decade. Mukhtar Omarhanuly for 15 years wrote his famous four-volume epic historical novel called \\"Abai Joly\\". It was translated into Russian. In 1949 two books of the novel \\"Abai\\" received the first level award of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This epic, which ended with four books, was awarded the Lenin prize. was translated into 30 languages, and received rave reviews from readers all over the world. \\"Abai Zholy\\" is one of the most popular and valuable novels written by Mukhtar Auezov. The first book of the series was published in 1942 and after five years in 1947 ‚ÄúAbai‚Äù, the second of the series was published, then came the third book in 1952 called ‚ÄúAbai aga‚Äù (Brother Abai). Finally, the fourth book was released in 1956. Later all of the books were repackaged and renamed as ‚ÄúAbai zholy‚Äù (The Path of Abai). The first book and second books each have 7 chapters and one epilogue. The third book has 6 chapters as has the Fourth and one epilogue entire epic is divided into 20 short chapters each of which includes uniquely interesting situations. Each chapter‚Äôs name precisely demonstrates the psychological state of the events within the story. If we compare there is much more drama, tragedy, sadness and sorrow than positive and happy moments. In the first book we can clearly see how the young and inexperienced boy grows up and at the end of the fourth book we see how he became an adult and changed and who ultimately fails.Kazakh culture, reference encyclopedia.

Its most famous and well known members were Edwin Booth, one of the leading actors of his day, and John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Abraham Lincoln. The patriarch was Junius Brutus Booth, a London-born lawyer's son who eventually became an actor after he attended a production of Othello at the Covent Garden theatre. The prospects of fame, fortune, and freedom were very appealing to young Booth, and he displayed remarkable talent from an early age, deciding on a career in the theatre by the age of 17. He performed roles in several small theaters throughout England, and joined a tour of the Low Countries in 1814, returning the following year to make his London debut. Booth abandoned his wife and their young son in 1821 and ran off to the United States with Mary Ann Holmes, a London flower girl. They settled on some 150 acres in Harford County near Baltimore and started a family; they had 10 children, six of whom survived to adulthood. Tudor Hall, a home in which Booth himself was never destined to live (it was not quite finished when he died) still stands today on Maryland Route 22 near Bel Air. It was acquired by Harford County in 2006, to be eventually opened to the public as an historic site and museum. Junius Sr. and Edwin toured in California during the Gold Rush. Edwin bought an interest in the Winter Garden Theatre at 667 Broadway in New York City together with his brother-in-law John Sleeper Clarke.

His father was of Spanish and Apache stock while his mother was a mix of Mexican, Cherokee and Irish. Both had migrated to Montana during the Great Depression, seeking employment as migrant farm workers. His nickname was bestowed on him by his grandfather. Since Romero often ran around without footwear, the nickname, from a Spanish phrase meaning \\"little boy with pig's feet\\" seemed appropriate. Romero cites a major turning point in his life in 1956. That was the year Elvis Presley performed \\"Hound Dog\\" on The Steve Allen Show. Presley was Romero's biggest influence prior to the arrival of Ritchie Valens on the Rock & Roll scene. The teenaged Chan Romero hitchhiked to East Los Angeles, California in 1958, where he wrote \\"Hippy Hippy Shake\\" and thus launched his career. An uncle introduced Romero and his music to an A&R; representative from Specialty Records: Sonny Bono. Bono was particularly taken with a song called \\"My Little Ruby\\" and asked Romero to polish the song and to return in a few weeks. Romero needed to return to school in Montana and never returned to Specialty. Upon forming a band upon his return, it soon became clear that Valens had a tremendous impact on Romero, so much so that the two artists, who never met, sounded alike and shared much the same ethnic heritage. Two months after the plane crash that claimed Valens' life, manager Don Redfield sent a tape to Valens' manager, Bob Keane, in Los Angeles. Keane was greatly impressed with the recordings and hailed Romero as a successor to Valens, immediately signing him to a contract on Del-Fi Records, the same label as Valens. When Romero returned to Los Angeles, Keane introduced him to Valens' grieving mother with whom Romero became close. Her home served as Romero's home during his visits to Los Angeles; he slept in Valens' bedroom. He remains close to the family and has performed at the Ritchie Valens memorial concert held yearly in Pacoima, California. Romero's career skyrocketed with the release of \\"Hippy Hippy Shake\\" in July 1959. Released first in the United States and later in Australia and in the UK, it soon came to the attention of Paul McCartney who liked the song and sang it at the Cavern Club in Liverpool and the Star Club in Hamburg during his early years with The Beatles. The 1964 version by The Swinging Blue Jeans hit number one across Europe. \\"Hippy Hippy Shake\\" remained a popular song as well as appearing in numerous movie soundtracks, among them Uncle Buck, It Takes Two and Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. Perhaps the best-known version to contemporary audiences appeared in 1988 on the soundtrack of Cocktail as performed by The Georgia Satellites. A version by The Beatles appeared on the 1994 release Live at the BBC. \\"Hippy Hippy Shake\\" was recorded by Polish singer Czes≈Çaw Niemen in 1964. Romero's first visit to Palm Springs, California in 1964 inspired him to make the area his home. He still lives in the area and divides his time between Palm Springs and Billings. Romero's daughter Holly Romero Sanchez is a youth pastor at Living Word in the Desert in Indio, California. ==References *Biography of Chan Romero by Mark Guerrero, son of Chicano music pioneer Lalo Guerrero *Chan Romero page at rockabillyhall.com *Chan Romero Discography at Discogs.com *Chan Romero Interview - NAMM Oral History Library (2016) Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American musicians of Mexican descent Category:American male singer-songwriters Category:Challenge Records artists Category:People from Billings, Montana Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:Songwriters from Montana Category:Del-Fi Records artists Category:Hispanic and Latino American musicians ","title":"Chan Romero"},{"id":"7451605","text":"A critically endangered (CR) species is one that has been categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. As of 2020, there are 6,811 species that are considered to be critically endangered. This is out of the 120,372 species currently tracked by the IUCN. The IUCN Red List provides the public with information regarding the conservation status of animal, fungi, and plant species. It divides various species into seven different categories of conservation that are based on habitat range, population size, habitat, threats, etc. Each category representing a different level of global extinction risk. Species that are considered to be critically endangered are placed within the \\"threatened\\" category As the IUCN Red List does not consider a species extinct until extensive, targeted surveys have been conducted, species that are possibly extinct are still listed as critically endangered. IUCN maintains a list of \\"possibly extinct\\" CR(PE) and \\"possibly extinct in the wild\\" CR(PEW) species, modelled on categories used by BirdLife International to categorize these taxa. ==Criteria for Critically Endangered Species== To be defined as critically endangered in the Red List, a species must meet any of the following criteria (A‚ÄìE) (\\"3G/10Y\\" signifies three generations or ten years‚Äîwhichever is longer‚Äîover a maximum of 100 years; \\"MI\\" signifies Mature Individuals): :A: Population Size Reduction :# The rate of reduction is measured either over a 10 year span or across three different generations within that species. :# The cause for this decline must also be known. :# If the reasons for population reduction no longer occur and can be reversed, the population needs to have been reduced by at least 90% :# If not, then the population needs to have been reduced by at least 80% :B: Reduction Across a Geographic Range :# This reduction must occur over less than 100 km2 OR the area of occupancy is less than 10 km. :## Severe habitat fragmentation or existing at just one location :## Decline in extent of occurrence, area of occupancy, area/extent/quality of habitat, number of locations/subpopulations, or amount of MI. :## Extreme fluctuations in extent of occurrence, area of occupancy, number of locations/subpopulations, or amount of MI. :C: Population Decline :# The population must decline to less than 250 MI and either: :## A decline of 25% over 3G/10Y :## Extreme fluctuations, or over 90% of MI in a single subpopulation, or no more than 50 MI in any one subpopulation. :D: Population Size Reduction :# The population size must be reduced to numbers of less than 50 MI. :E: Probability of Extinction :# There must be at least a 50% probability of going extinct in the wild within over 3G/10Y == Causes == The current extinction crisis is witnessing extinction rates that are occurring at a faster rate than that of the natural extinction rate. It has largely been credited towards human impacts on climate change and the loss of biodiversity. This is along with natural forces that may create stress on the species or cause an animal population to become extinct. The main causes for critically endangered species is the following. # Loss of Habitat ## This is considered to be one of the most significant reasons animals and plants become endangered. ## Species rely on their habitat for the resources needed for their survival. If the habitat becomes destroyed, the population will see a decline in their numbers. ## Some activities that cause habitat loss is: ### Climate change ### Geologic change ### Human migration ### Highway construction ### Urbanization ### Agriculture # Introduction of Invasive Species ## Invasive species invade and exploit a new habitat for its natural resources as a method to outcompete the native organisms, eventually taking over the habitat. ## This can lead to either the native species' extinction or causing them to become endangered. # Disease ## The introduction of a disease into a new habitat can cause it to spread amongst the native species. ## Due to their lack of familiarity with the disease or little resistance, the native species can die off. ## This will cause the population's numbers to be reduced. # Environmental Population ## Pollution is harmful to both the species and habitat. ## This can cause the population's numbers to be reduced. ## Pollution can be in the form of: ### Air ### Light ### Noise ### Pesticides ### Chemicals # Depletion of Natural Resources ## If resources become overexploited and depleted, there is no longer enough resources to sustain the native species of this habitat. # Hunting/Fishing ## Overhunting/overfishing of a certain species can cause other species who prey on that particularly species to starve. ## Overhunting/overfishing of a certain species can also cause them to become endangered due to population depletion. == Conservation == A high percentage of species have become extinct and are considered to be critically endangered. Conservation methods are necessary in order to provide relief and recovery for species that are facing extinction. This is due to the declining rate of biodiversity as ecosystems collapse alongside its extinct and critically endangered species. It would take years before another species population would return to the habitat and increase its biodiversity rate. Conservation methods such as the following allow for human imposed threats of these critically endangered species to be lessened. # Educate Yourself and Others ## This is considered to be one of the most essential conservation methods. ### By learning about wildlife, you are better able to understand the importance of these endangered species and the resources needed for their survival. ### This can either be learning the wildlife in your local neighborhood or across different nations. ### You can then educate friends, family, and neighbors on information regarding various local and global species. ## This includes activities such as: ### Visiting a national wildlife refuge or park ### Volunteering ### Observe the plants and animals around you # Recycle and Use Sustainable Products ## Recycling helps to reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in both the marine and terrestrial ecosystems. ## Using more sustainable products that allows for repetitive use will prevent the amount of trash and recycling waste that ends up in our environment. # Encourage Wildlife-Friendly Practices in Your Neighborhood ## This includes cleaning objects that is used by communities of animals in order to prevent disease transmission, ### Example: bird baths and hummingbird feeders ## Ensure that garbage cans are closed so that animals cannot be attracted towards it. ### Also, ensuring that food is not left outdoors and areas with water are main. ## Maintain the speed limit of your neighborhood to avoid accidentally killing any animals. This may limit the reduction of a native species population size within a certain area if it is a common occurrence within this species. # Monitor Your Chemical Usage ## Try to avoid using harsh chemicals, herbicides, and pesticides as they have been known to degrade the soil within its surrounding environment. ## High levels these pollutants can be considered as threatening or even toxic to native species. # Do Not Engage in Illegal Wildlife Captivity ## Poaching not only decreases the population's numbers, but also disrupts the balance of a certain habitat. This is due to the fact the certain species are considered to be assets to their environment as they provide it with natural resources. By poaching off a particular species, you may be depriving the habitat of the resources needed to sustain its other native animal and plant species. ## Poached animals have also been known to introduce and spread disease amongst human populations through wildlife trade. This can also affect the health of an environment by threatening its native species populations. ### Example: SARS, COVID-19, Ebola, etc. # Develop Protective and Relief Projects for Threatened Species ## The Endangered Species Act was signed into law in 1973 by Richard Nixon in order to protect animals and plants who were facing possible extinction after an already visible decline of several species in the 1900s. ### This is intended to allow species to recover to the point where they no longer need protection. ## The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service created the relief program \\"Critically Endangered Animals Conservation Fund\\" to send funding to continents such as Africa, Asia, South America, and Oceania to create projects that provide assistance with the recovery of critically endangered species from the brink of extinction. == See also == * Lists of IUCN Red List Critically Endangered species for lists ordered by taxonomic rank. * :Category:IUCN Red List critically endangered species for an alphabetical list * The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates * The world's 100 most threatened species * IUCN for additional information on the IUCN * List of critically endangered amphibians * List of critically endangered arthropods * List of critically endangered birds * List of critically endangered fish * List of critically endangered insects * List of critically endangered invertebrates * List of critically endangered mammals * List of critically endangered molluscs * List of critically endangered plants * List of critically endangered reptiles * List of Chromista by conservation status * List of fungi by conservation status == References  Citations = General sources === * List of Critically Endangered Species.

It connects Northport Highway (Federal Route 103) in Port Klang to Teluk Gedong near Pandamaran. The Kilometre Zero of the Federal Route 180 starts at Port Klang. ==Features== At most sections, the Federal Route 180 was built under the JKR R5 road standard, allowing maximum speed limit of up to 90 km/h. ===Port Klang flyover=== The Port Klang flyover above Jalan Kem was supposed to make driving between Westport and Northport faster and more convenient, but it has instead become a danger to motorists. The two-kilometre flyover has been stripped of its metal barriers at the side. Should an accident occur, chances are the vehicles involved would fall onto the road below. And there is a high probability of an accident happening, especially at night, as most of the street lights on the flyover are not working. Motorists have expressed concern over the danger posed by the missing barriers and the non-functioning lights as many lorries used the flyover. There is also no emergency lane on the flyover and in the event of a breakdown, an accident could easily happen, especially at night. The Malaysian Public Works Department (JKR) was responsible for maintaining the flyover and the Majlis Perbandaran Klang (Klang Municipal Council) (MPKlg) had written to them asking for repair works to be carried out.

The original Birdland, which was located at 1678 Broadway, just north of West 52nd Street in Manhattan, was closed in 1965 due to increased rents, but it re-opened for one night in 1979. A revival began in 1986 with the opening of the second nightclub by the same name that is now located in Manhattan's Theater District, not far from the original nightclub's location. The current location is in the same building as the previous headquarters of The New York Observer. == The original Birdland (1949‚Äì1965) == Club interior Birdland bar ===1678 Broadway, below the street level=== Irving Levy (1923‚Äì1959), Morris Levy, and Oscar Goodstein ‚Äì along with six other partners ‚Äì purchased the venue in 1949 from Joseph \\"Joe the Wop\\" Catalano.Nick Talevski, Knocking on Heaven's Door: Rock Obituaries, pp. 368‚Äì369, Omnibus Press (2006) They adopted the name \\"Birdland\\" to capitalize on the popularity of their regular headliner Charlie \\"Yardbird\\" Parker, who, at that time, had been enjoying undisputed popularity as a jazz artist. The club was originally scheduled to open on September 8, 1949, but this was put back to December 15 following difficulties in getting a liquor license. The opening night was \\"A Journey Through Jazz\\", consisting of various styles of the music up to that point, played by \\"Maxie Kaminsky, Hot Lips Page, Lester Young, Charlie Parker, Harry Belafonte, Stan Getz, and Lennie Tristano, in that order.\\" Parker, in reality, played very few jobs at Birdland, not because he was troublesome (from drug addiction), but, according to Gene Ramey, Goodstein said, \\"He was continually wanting money.\\" Ramey had persuaded Goodstein to let Parker perform at Birdland with his band on a pair of Monday nights in 1954.Douglas K. Ramsey, Jazz Matters: Reflections on the Music & Some of Its Makers, University of Arkansas Press (1989), p. 118 . The neon sign at the front of the club read, \\"Birdland, Jazz Corner of the World\\". The venue seated 500 people and had space for a full orchestra. It had a long bar, tables, booths, and a fenced-in bullpen ‚Äî a drinkless area, nicknamed \\"the peanut gallery\\", where teenagers were sometimes allowed to watch. Irving Levy and Morris Levy were the main owners but the club was operated by Oscar Goodstein, who took tickets and tended the bar. In the late 50s, he moved his post to the back hallway where he could compare the trays from the kitchen with the order tickets. Some lucky few could spend the wee hours chatting with him and reading letters musicians like Charlie Mingus sent him. Goldstein called Mingus a prolific writer.John Szwed, So What: The Life and Times of Miles Davis, p. 92, Simon & Schuster (2001) The name was carried through into the feature of caged finches inside the club. The venue attracted other jazz musicians who also made recordings there. This includes Art Blakey's 1954 two- volume A Night at Birdland, most of John Coltrane's Live at Birdland, the Toshiko ‚Äì Mariano Quartet's Live at Birdland, and Count Basie's Basie at Birdland. Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis, Louie Bellson,Bellson discusses his experience with Stephane Grappelli at Birdland on the album notes for Stephane Grapelli with Phil Woods and Louis Bellson, of the Who's Who in Jazz series, recorded September 22, 1987. Bud Powell, Johnny Smith, Stan Getz, Lester Young, and many others made appearances. George Shearing's standard \\"Lullaby of Birdland\\" (1952) was named in the club's honor. The club's original master of ceremonies, the diminutive, four feet tall Pee Wee Marquette, was notorious for mispronouncing the names of musicians if they refused to tip him. The disc jockey Symphony Sid broadcast live on WJZ early in the club's existence. On August 25, 1959, Miles Davis was beaten by a New York City policeman on the sidewalk in front of Birdland, during a performing engagement at the club. During the 1950s, Birdland also became a fashionable place for celebrities to be seen, with Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner, Gary Cooper, Marilyn Monroe, Sugar Ray Robinson, Marlene Dietrich, Joe Louis, Judy Garland and others as regulars. Irving Levy was stabbed to death at the club Sunday, January 26, 1959 (after midnight January 25) while Urbie Green was performing. The body was discovered in the rear of the club, near the service area. The stabbing had apparently occurred unnoticed by the patrons. Irving's younger brother, Morris, took over Irving's role in the club, and from 1959 through the early 1960s, the club enjoyed great success as one of the few remaining jazz clubs in the area. Johnnie Garry, the production coordinator and historian for the Jazzmobile project, managed the club in the early 1960s. ===Chapter 11 bankruptcy (June 1964)=== In June 1964, Birdland filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in New York Federal Court. Goodstein was president of the club at the time. Creditors included Goodstein himself ($22,490), NLP Restaurant ($12,275), and Gerry Mulligan ($3,500), who had been booked through International Talent Associates. In an effort to stem losses in 1964, Birdland started booking jazz artists that played a more traditional style of jazz, rather than the \\"way-out\\" artists.\\"Bankrupt NY Birdland Reports $103,778 in the Red\\", The Washington Afro American, p. 14, June 30, 1964. In 1965, Goodstein closed Birdland. The premises was taken over by Lloyd Price, an R&B; and rock-and-roll singer who re-dedicated the venue and named it the Turntable.The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, edited by Stanley Sadie & John Tyrrell, Grove (2001) == Birdland (1985‚Äìpresent) == The third incarnation of Birdland on West 44th Street in 2008 ===2745 Broadway at 105th (1986‚Äì1996)=== The current version of Birdland, initially owned by John R. Valenti, opened in the Upper West Side of Manhattan in 1985, at 2745 Broadway at 105th Street, and presented emerging artists to a neighborhood audience . ===315 West 44th Street, between 8th and 9th Avenues (1996‚Äìpresent)=== In 1996, Valenti moved the club to West 44th Street, west of Eighth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan where it features a full weekly schedule of performers. Notable performers have included Michael Brecker, Pat Metheny, Lee Konitz, Diana Krall, Dave Holland, Regina Carter, and Tito Puente. It is also notable as the club where Toshiko Akiyoshi's jazz orchestra, on December 29, 2003, played its final concert. As mentioned above she had also played at the original Birdland. ===Resident bands=== The Birdland Big Band == Pop culture references == Vincent Herring performing in Birdland in 2005 Birdland was popular with many of the writers of the Beat generation. Reference to Birdland is made in Jack Kerouac's novel On the Road: \\"I saw him wish a well-to-do man Merry Christmas so volubly a five-spot in change for twenty was never missed. We went out and spent it in Birdland, the bop joint. Lester Young was on the stand, eternity on his huge eyelids.\\" Birdland is also referenced in Emmett Grogan's novel Ringolevio. \\"From the get-go, Birdland became one of his favourite haunts.\\" George Shearing's popular song \\"Lullaby of Birdland\\" (with lyrics later added by George David Weiss) refers to the club. Since Sarah Vaughan's 1954 hit version, it has been a jazz standard. In 1993, Us3 released the single \\"Cantaloop\\", which opens with the line: \\"Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, we have something special down here at Birdland this evening\\"; Pee Wee Marquette's opening announcement from Art Blakey's first Birdland album in 1954. Weather Report released their most commercially successful hit entitled \\"Birdland\\" on the album Heavy Weather in 1977. The Manhattan Transfer recorded a cover version of the same song in 1979, with vocalese lyrics describing the club in its heyday. U2 references the club in the song \\"Angel of Harlem\\" with the lyrics \\"...Birdland on 53, the streets sounds like a symphony...\\" However, the club was on Broadway near 52nd street, not 53rd. In the play Send Me No Flowers, George Kimball relates a story concerning a female friend who ran off with a \\"bongo player from Birdland\\" after her husband died. The bongo player subsequently \\"took her for every cent\\". In the play Middle of the Night, the husband remembers the good old days at Birdland with his wife, in an attempt to save their marriage. Sesame Street featured a night club called Birdland, run by Hoots the Owl, which was occupied by various birds. William Claxton took a picture of the club's entrance in 1960.

It tells the story of a simple Egyptian civil servant, Anis (played by Emad Hamdi), who cannot tolerate the hypocrisy of the Egyptian government (for whom he works at the Ministry of Health) and the illiteracy of the Egyptian public and decides to hide from all the problems in the country by taking up smoking hashish in a shisha, a popular smoking habit in Egypt, to escape from reality. Anis (who used to work as a teacher) meets with an old student, Ragab (actor Ahmed Ramzy), by chance. Ragab invites him to the small boat in the Nile. And Anis discovers soon enough that he is not the only person who smokes shisha but a bunch of other elite, middle class and low class people are all on the boat. He soon discovers that everyone is smoking to forget the reality and hypocrisy of Egyptian life. ==Political background== The film was released during the era of the government of Anwar Al Sadat and was quickly removed from the market because it was seen as a criticism of the Nasser period, when films that did not conform with Nasser's politics and ideology were often suppressed. Anwar al-Sadat didn't want to upset the Egyptian people, some of whom still loved and respected Nasser. The films deals frankly with the issue of drug addiction, as well as the decadence that obtained during the late Nasser era. The film was produced in 1971, and was unsuccessful financially, as it was frequently banned in the Middle East and also in the West (mainly Europe). It only gained acclaim thirty-five years later. It is still banned in many countries, especially in the Arab world. The film is now distributed by Founoon and is subtitled in French and English. == External links == * Category:1971 films Category:1970s comedy-drama films Category:Egyptian films Category:Arabic-language films Category:Egyptian black-and-white films Category:Films based on Egyptian novels Category:Novels by Naguib Mahfouz Category:Films directed by Hussein Kamal Category:Films based on works by Naguib Mahfouz Category:1971 comedy films Category:1971 drama films ","title":"Chitchat on the Nile"},{"id":"7451712","text":"Eureka Airport may refer to: * Eureka Aerodrome in Eureka, Nunavut, Canada * Eureka Airport (Nevada) in Eureka, Nevada, United States * Arcata-Eureka Airport, a commercial airport serving Arcata & Eureka, California, United States * Eureka Municipal Airport (California), a general-aviation airport serving Eureka, California, United States (FAA: O33) * Eureka Municipal Airport (Kansas), an airport serving Eureka, Kansas, United States (FAA: 13K) * Eureka Municipal Airport (South Dakota), an airport serving Eureka, South Dakota, United States (FAA: 3W8) ==See also== * Eureka Municipal Airport (disambiguation) ","title":"Eureka Airport"},{"id":"7451713","text":"Dalmasan, Mt.

However, for the balance of the team, he still plays as a batting allrounder in the limited overs cricket. A more than useful strike rate of 84.06 has made him a damaging prospect in the final overs of the Sri Lankan innings.Angelo Mathews (Player Profile)- ESPN Cricnifo He made his international debut in a One Day International against Zimbabwe in November 2008 and made his Test debut against Pakistan at Galle in July, 2009. Angelo Mathews at Sydney Cricket Ground in October 2010 Angelo Mathews made his Test debut in Pakistan tour of Sri Lanka, 2009.

On 17 August 2016, under Mathews' captaincy, Sri Lanka whitewashed Australia, which was at the Number 1 in Test rankings. This was the second time that Sri Lanka managed to Whitewash a major Test side in their history.

In July 2017, Sri Lanka lost a five-match home ODI series 3‚Äì2 against Zimbabwe. Matthews said the defeat was \\"one of the lowest points in my career\\" and he stepped down as captain of the team in all three formats the following day. ===Post captaincy (2017)=== On 4 December 2017 against India, Mathews scored his eighth test century. His century came during a tough time for Sri Lanka's innings, where he built the innings slowly with captain Dinesh Chandimal. Finally Sri Lanka was able to drawn the match.

He was stepped down from captaincy at the end of Zimbabwe tour of Sri Lanka in 2017 after ODI loss. However, with many defeats in all formats in 2017, new coach Chandika Hathurusinghe and new selection committee handed over limited over captaincy for Mathews for the second time.

On fifth day, they put on an unbeaten double century partnership which overall lasts for 115 wicketless overs for New Zealanders. With rain interrupted, the match was ended in a draw. The partnership of 246, was also Sri Lanka's highest for any wicket against New Zealand and also Sri Lanka's highest in the second innings of a Test. It was the first time a Sri Lankan pair has added 200-plus runs in the second innings of a Test outside Asia. In the second Test, Mathews injured with a hamstring trouble while he was batting with Chandimal. He was immediately sent for the medical scans and did not come to bat after tea. Sri Lanka finally lost the match and series 1‚Äì0. He was ruled out of the ODI tour and upcoming Australian tour as well. In April 2019, he was named in Sri Lanka's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. After consecutive failures of 0,0, 9 with the bat in World Cup, Mathews regained his form during the pool match against England. He scored unbeaten 85 runs to post a total of 232. With the bowling performance by veteran Malinga, Sri Lanka won the match by 20 runs. During the match, Mathews scored his 12,000th international run for Sri Lanka. During the match against West Indies on 1 July 2019, Mathews surprisingly requested to bowl the 48th over. He picked up the wicket of Nicolas Pooran who was on 118, and was all set to take the West Indies to victory. Mathews, had not bowled for 8 months, even in the nets. The match winning ball was later known as the \\"Craziest ball in World Cup 2019\\".

Mathews was included to the T20I series against India in January 2020. It was his first T20I appearance after 16 months. He played in the third T20I on 10 January 2020 and started to ball as well. However, he finished with expensive figures of 38 runs in three overs without a wicket. With the bat, he scored 31 runs and Sri Lanka eventually lost the match and the series. On 22 January 2020, during the first test against Zimbabwe, Mathews scored his maiden double hundred. He scored unbeaten 200 runs in 465 balls within 600 minutes in the middle. His double hundred is recorded as the first double hundred scored by a Sri Lanka in five years after Sangakkara's double in 2015. Finally Sri Lanka won the match by 10 wickets and Mathews won the man of the match award. Sri Lanka was able to draw the second Test due to second innings unbeaten century by Kusal Mendis and sealed the series 1-0. Mathews won the player of the series award becoming highest run scorer in the series. Mathews scored 277 runs with a double hundred and one fifty at an average 138.50. During third ODI against West Indies, Mathews delivered match winning bowling spell. He bowled all 10 overs in the match since way back in July 2015 due to the injury of premier pacer Nuwan Pradeep. He took 4 for 59 where he bowled the penultimate over to win the match for Sri Lanka by 6 runs. He won man of the match award for match winning bowling performance. ==Criticism== With three legends (Sangakkara, Jayawardene, Dilshan) retiring from international cricket, the team had a rough time in many bilateral series in all formats. They also lost Asia Cup, World T20 and Champions Trophy very cheaply and moved down to 8 and 7 places in rankings as well. With all these, Bangladesh toured Sri Lanka and drawn all formats, whereas Zimbabwe also recorded their first series win against Sri Lanka and the captaincy of Mathews was criticized for many reasons for their losses. Though he injured several times in his captaincy career, and replaced by Upul Tharanga in many winning notes, reporters suggested that Mathews will not captain until 2019 Cricket World Cup. Mathews was highly criticized for his running between the wickets. Sri Lanka coach Chandika Hathurusinghe stated that Mathews has involved for more than 64 run outs in past two years, more than the second worst. Out of those 64, about 45 times, the batsman at the other end got out, where Hathurusinghe suggested that it is a world record. Hathurusingha and the selectors contended that Mathews lacked the \\"cricket fitness\\" to field for 50 overs, then run between the wickets effectively. Under Mathews captaincy, Sri Lanka exit early from 2018 Asia Cup, where he was involved for three more run outs in the same fashion. Therefore, immediately after the series, he was removed from the limited over captaincy and also from the limited over squad for England home series. ==Personal life== Mathews was born in Colombo, to Tamil father Tyronne Mathews and Burgher mother Monica Mathews. Like retired bowling legend Chaminda Vaas, Mathews is Roman Catholic and was educated at St. Joseph's College, Colombo. He is the first Josephian to be appointed captain of the national team. Mathews is married to his longtime partner, Heshanie Silva. The wedding reception was held on 18 July 2013 at Cinnamon Grand Hotel with the presence of former president Mahinda Rajapakse.http://magazine.lankahelp.com/2013/07/30/angelo-mathews-and- heshanis-love-story/ They have one son and one daughter. ==Product and brand endorsements== Angelo Mathews endorses the following products: * Samsung: 2008‚Äìpresent * Hewlett-Packard: 2011‚Äìpresent *Ceylon Cold Stores: 2011‚Äìpresent *Nestl√© Lanka: 2012‚Äìpresent ==Records and statistics== * Highest ninth wicket partnership ‚Äì 132 by Angelo Mathews (77) and Lasith Malinga (56) against Australia in November 2010. * Most wins in year 2014 as a captain ‚Äì Under the captaincy of Mathews, Sri Lanka won 20 ODI matches, lost 12 out of 32 matches and winning percentage is 62.50 * First cricketer to play in 50 T20I innings without registering a duck ==Awards== *2015 Wisden Cricketer of the Year * Dialog SLC Cricketer of the Year 2015 * Dialog SLC Test All-rounder of the Year 2015 * Dialog SLC ODI All-rounder of the Year 2015 ==ReferencesAngelo Mathews (Player Profile) Wisden India * Official Site * Angelo Mathews Island Cricket Category:1987 births Category:Basnahira cricketers Category:Basnahira North cricketers Category:Sri Lanka Test cricket captains Category:Colts Cricket Club cricketers Category:Cricketers at the 2011 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers at the 2015 Cricket World Cup Category:Cricketers at the 2019 Cricket World Cup Category:Delhi Capitals cricketers Category:Kolkata Knight Riders cricketers Category:Living people Category:Pune Warriors India cricketers Category:Nagenahira Nagas cricketers Category:Sri Lankan cricketers Category:Sri Lanka Test cricketers Category:Sri Lanka One Day International cricketers Category:Sri Lanka Twenty20 International cricketers Category:Sri Lankan Roman Catholics Category:Lahore Qalandars cricketers Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year ","title":"Angelo Mathews"},{"id":"7451721","text":"Chinatown, Singapore.

By the end of the fifth show, a winner is determined. The sixth show was a \\"director's cut\\" that includes excerpts from the action from the previous five days, interspersed with talking heads commentary from the participants. Beginning with Season 4, the producers began to experiment with different formats, including no-limit cash games, and a double-elimination Heads Up battle between the first 4 winners of the National Heads-Up Poker Championship.Season 4 preview from Poker News Also, Seasons 3, 4 and 5 had a \\"Dream Table,\\" pitting an amateur against five pros. ==Broadcast== Poker After Dark aired six times a week, at 2:05 a.m. ET (1:05 CT) Tuesday through Saturday, and then at 1:00 a.m. ET (12:00 CT) on Sundays, though times vary according to the preferences of the affiliates.http://www.nbc.com/schedule/?tz=ET The early Sunday show is a \\"director's cut\\" weekly summary of the previous week's shows. Several NBC affiliates, most notably those owned by Post-Newsweek Stations, Barrington Broadcasting, some Raycom Media stations, WBBH-TV in Fort Myers, Florida, and the LDS Church-owned KSL-TV in Salt Lake City refused to air the show due to management or locality objections against programs featuring gambling (the Post-Newsweek stations also refused to carry Face the Ace in August 2009), while other stations did not carry it due to existing syndication contracts precluding it from airing the series or to retain control of their overnight schedules. It was not aired entirely in the state of Texas due to the state's strict gambling laws. NBC abruptly stopped airing Poker After Dark on September 23, 2011,http://www.lasvegasvegas.com/content/nbc-national-heads- poker-championship-folds-1319490592 a few days after Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, issued a statement alleging production underwriter Full Tilt Poker had perpetrated a Ponzi scheme on its customers. Replacing the show was a rebroadcast of the Hoda Kotb/Kathie Lee Gifford-hosted fourth hour of Today, and on the weekends, a second episode of In Wine Country from San Francisco Bay Area NBC station KNTV. NBC Sports has since removed their poker section entirely from their webpage, and previous episodes have been removed from Hulu. Although NBC did not issue a definitive statement regarding the schedule change or the future of the show, NBC Sports Senior Director of Communications Adam Freifeld has stated that NBC will \\"continue to evaluate our poker programming.\\" Since 2017, Poker After Dark has aired live each month exclusively on PokerGO.

Hellmuth held , while Duke had . The lack of decorum caused Hellmuth to lash out at Shawn Sheikhan, call over the show's executive producer, and leave the table. Hellmuth also threatened not to participate in future Poker After Dark tournaments unless the show implemented a rule that encouraged people to stop talking when a player is making an important decision. Immediately after the incident, producers put in place a rule which states that if a player wishes to have silence at the table when faced with a tough decision, the player need only inform the dealer, who will then notify the other players of the request.

Phil Hellmuth attempted to bluff the river with pair of aces on the board in a hand against Jean-Robert Bellande, and Bellande called. Hellmuth then said \\"you got it\\" and held onto his cards, waiting for Bellande to show the winner. Bellande felt he did not have to show his hand, while Hellmuth thought \\"olden day etiquette\\" indicated that he should. The tournament was stopped for 5 minutes while all players voiced their opinions and eventually the producer came over and then Hellmuth showed his hand, necessitating that Bellande show his to claim the pot.Poker After Dark Hecklers Recap from the PAD website *\\"Jam Up\\" week featured a rule that allowed any player knocked out over the first six hands (once around the table) to rebuy. On the first hand, Eli Elezra was knocked out when his AK didn't crack Howard Lederer's AA when they both got all their chips in pre- flop. Eli was allowed to rebuy for another $20,000, which brought the total chips in play to $140,000, and the first place prize to $140,000. *The \\"Best Of\\" episode that closed Season 5 featured Elezra's knockout on the first hand of Jam Up week, but did not make clear that he was able to rebuy after busting out on the first hand per that week's rules, and insinuated he was eliminated. ===Season 4 (2008)=== Weeks 1 and 7 were Cash Games #1 and #2, and are omitted from the results table. {  - !

Their use seems to be to support the weight of fecal matter, and prevent its urging toward the anus, which would produce a strong urge to defecate. Although the term rectum means straight, these transverse folds overlap each other during the empty state of the intestine to such an extent that, as Houston remarked, they require considerable maneuvering to conduct an instrument along the canal, as often occurs in sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. These folds are about 12 mm. in width and are composed of the circular muscle coat of the rectum. They are usually three in number; sometimes a fourth is found, and occasionally only two are present. * One is situated near the commencement of the rectum, on the right side. * A second extends inward from the left side of the tube, opposite the middle of the sacrum. * A third, the largest and most constant, projects backward from the forepart of the rectum, opposite the fundus of the urinary bladder. * When a fourth is present, it is situated nearly 2.5 cm above the anus on the left and posterior wall of the tube. Transverse folds were first described by Irish‚ÄìBritish anatomist John Houston, curator of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland Museum, in 1830. They appear to be peculiar to human physiology: Baur (1863) looked for Houston's valves in a number of mammals, including wolf, bear, rhinoceros, and several Old World primates, but found no evidence.

He is currently ranked number one in the world, having won the PDC World Darts Championship in 2014, 2017, and 2019. Van Gerwen began playing darts at the age of 13. He won the 2006 World Masters and threw a televised nine-dart finish at the 2007 Masters of Darts, becoming the youngest player to do either at age 17. However, after this initial burst onto the darting scene, van Gerwen struggled for consistent form until his breakthrough year in 2012. Improving from world number 38 at the start of 2012 to number four at the beginning of 2013, he won his first major PDC title at the World Grand Prix and reached the final at the 2013 World Championship. In 2014, at the age of 24, van Gerwen became the youngest winner of the PDC World Championship, a record he still holds today. He also holds the record for the highest three- dart average in a televised darts match, with 123.40. He has dominated darts in subsequent years, winning 18 tournaments in 2015 and 25 in 2016. Van Gerwen is the second most successful player in PDC history, behind Phil Taylor. He has won the most PDC Pro Tour events, winning 75 as of June 2019. He passed Taylor's previous record of 70 on 16 February 2019 by winning Players Championship Event 3, beating Ian White 8‚Äì5 in the final. ==Early life== Michael van Gerwen was born on 25 April 1989 in Boxtel in the Netherlands. He played football as a defender until he was 12 and began playing darts regularly at 13. He reached the final of the Primus Masters Youth event at the age of 14 in 2003. He then started to amass youth titles in 2005 including the German Open, German Gold Cup, Norway Open, Northern Ireland Open, Swedish Open and the Dutch National Youth Championship; which he also defended in 2006. He also won the Men's events in the Norway and Northern Ireland Opens in the same year that he took the youth titles. Before he became a professional darts player, he worked as a tiler. ==BDO career== Van Gerwen picked up several Open titles and rose up the BDO/WDF World Rankings having climbed to third before his 18th birthday. He reached the semi-finals of the Bavaria World Darts Trophy in 2006. Despite losing to Martin Adams, the Dutch youngster came within one dart of the perfect nine-dart finish, just missing double twelve. He did manage the highest possible checkout of 170 during the tournament. He managed to eclipse that performance at the 2006 Winmau World Masters by becoming the youngest ever champion. Having trailed 1‚Äì4 and 2‚Äì5 to Adams, he came back to win the title and take Eric Bristow's record as the youngest ever winner at the age of 17 years and 174 days. His early career success led to the inevitable speculation that he may join the other professional circuit of darts, the Professional Darts Corporation. However, during the 2006 World Darts Trophy, van Gerwen held a press conference to make it clear that he wanted to stay with the BDO/WDF. He also finished top of the DDF (Dutch Darts Federation) Rankings ‚Äì which would have secured him a place at the PDC World Championship, if he chose to accept. He had already committed to playing at Lakeside, so the place went to Rico Vonck who finished second in the rankings. Van Gerwen was the bookmakers pre-tournament favourite to win the 2007 Lakeside World title, but his hopes were ended in the first round by Gary Robson. On the night of the 2007 BDO World Championship final, it was announced on Dutch television that Van Gerwen, along with Jelle Klaasen and Vincent van der Voort, would be switching to the Professional Darts Corporation. ==PDC career2007‚Äì2011=== Van Gerwen started at 88 in the PDC World Rankings. Although he was a BDO player he was eligible for certain PDC events in his home country, even before he switched to the PDC. This included the Open Holland in 2006, in which he took the title. He made his PDC debut on 20 January at the non-televised Stan James Players Championships in Gibraltar and beat Andy Hamilton before losing in the last 16 to fellow countryman Roland Scholten. In the second Players Championship the following day, he beat Raymond van Barneveld in the early rounds only to lose to Alan Warriner-Little in the quarter-finals. He followed up his victory over van Barneveld by beating 13 times World Champion Phil Taylor by 3 sets to 0 on the opening night of the Masters of Darts tournament. All three sets went to a deciding leg which van Gerwen clinched with 14, 12 and 12 darts. He went on to reach the semi-final of the tournament and achieved a perfect nine-dart finish against van Barneveld, but lost the match. His televised PDC debut came at the 2007 UK Open, where he lost in the last 32 to Colin Osborne. He failed to qualify for the 2007 Las Vegas Desert Classic and was defeated in round two of the World Matchplay in Blackpool by Ronnie Baxter 12‚Äì14, having been one leg from victory at 12‚Äì10. His first PDC World Championship saw him paired with Phil Taylor in 2008's first round; notably, he had one dart at double 12 to win the match and knock out the 13 time world champion. It would have ended Taylor's phenomenal record of reaching every PDC World Championship Final. Wayne Mardle did end Taylor's run in that year's quarter-finals. Van Gerwen ended his long wait for a tournament victory by beating his Dutch compatriot Vincent van der Voort 6‚Äì3 in the final of the Players Championship in Taunton on 11 April 2009 and earned him ¬£6,000 towards the Order of Merit. Van Gerwen was defeated 6‚Äì4 by Arron Monk in the final of the inaugural PDC Under-21 World Championship during the 2011 PDC World Championship. ===2012=== He made it to the last 16 of the PDC World Championship for the first time in the 2012 edition by beating Colin Osborne and Mervyn King. Van Gerwen lost nine out of the first ten legs in his last 16 game to trail 0‚Äì3 to Simon Whitlock, but produced an incredible comeback to level the match at 3‚Äì3. He couldn't maintain his form, however, as he lost all three legs in the deciding set to exit the tournament 3‚Äì4. Van Gerwen was named Young Player of the Year at the PDC annual awards ceremony on 3 January 2012, for winning four PDC Unicorn Youth Tour events during 2011 and his World Championship run. In 2012, he won the second UK Open qualifier of the season, defeating Dave Chisnall in the final 6‚Äì1. In the UK Open itself he lost in the last 16 to Terry Jenkins. Van Gerwen won the eighth Players Championship event in June after beating Simon Whitlock 6‚Äì1 in the final. At the World Matchplay, he won 5 legs in a row to record a 10‚Äì6 victory over Simon Whitlock in the first round, and then faced a last 16 encounter with Steve Beaton, which he won 13‚Äì9 while throwing the fourth nine-dart finish in the tournament's history in the tenth leg. Van Gerwen was 5‚Äì11 down in his quarter-final against James Wade, but produced a fightback to only trail 11‚Äì12 and then missed one dart to level the game. He went on to lose 13‚Äì16. Van Gerwen's third title of the year came at the 11th Players Championship, where he defeated Ian White 6‚Äì1 in the final with a 107.85 average. Van Gerwen was involved in an exceptional match in the last 16 of the European Championship as he was defeated by compatriot Raymond van Barneveld 9‚Äì10, despite averaging 104. Another Players Championship success followed with a 6‚Äì5 victory over Robert Thornton. In October 2012, van Gerwen won his first PDC major title at the World Grand Prix. He came from behind to knock out Colin Lloyd 2‚Äì1 in the first round, and then beat an out of sorts Adrian Lewis 3‚Äì1 in the second. In the quarter-final against Andy Hamilton, he missed four darts to win 3‚Äì1, only for Hamilton to take out a 160 finish to force a decider. Van Gerwen maintained his composure and took the final set 3‚Äì2 and then heavily out-scored Wes Newton in the semi-finals in a 5‚Äì1 win. He played Mervyn King in the final, defeating him 6‚Äì4, after being 0‚Äì3 and 1‚Äì4 down. Van Gerwen afterwards described the win as the best day in his life and in claiming the ¬£100,000 prize he rose to world number eight, overtaking van Barneveld as the highest placed Dutchman. He did not have to wait long for his sixth title of the year, as he won the following week's Players Championship averaging 113 against Jamie Caven in the semi-finals, before beating Nick Fullwell 6‚Äì3 in the final. In a Championship League game, van Gerwen averaged an incredible 121.86 whilst defeating Steve Beaton 6‚Äì0. He won six of his seven league matches to finish top of the table, but then lost 5‚Äì6 to the same opponent in the semi-finals. He soon returned to winning ways by taking another Players Championship title, coming back from 0‚Äì4 in the final against Ian White to triumph 6‚Äì5. Van Gerwen won all three of his group games at the Grand Slam of Darts to top Group B and face Phil Taylor in the last 16, in a match billed as a clash between the current best two players in the world. There, van Gerwen ended a five-year, 15-game losing streak against Taylor to defeat him 10‚Äì5 with a 108.38 average in a performance he described as the best of his career. He played Scott Waites in the quarter-finals, who himself had already beaten Taylor in the tournament, and produced another superb display as he hit two 170 finishes and an average of 106.63 in a 16‚Äì12 win. He averaged over 100 once more to defeat Dean Winstanley 16‚Äì8 in the semi-finals, to set up a clash in the final against compatriot and five-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld. Van Gerwen was never ahead in the final and couldn't quite match the heavy scoring and clinical finishing he had produced earlier in the tournament as he was beaten 14‚Äì16. His eighth tournament win of 2012 came at the 20th and final Players Championship, where he beat Taylor for the first time in a final and also beat reigning world champion Adrian Lewis in the semi-finals. He was 4‚Äì5 down to Taylor, but produced back-to-back finishes of 164 and 124 to win and in doing so finished third on the ProTour Order of Merit to qualify for the Finals. Van Gerwen went out of the Finals in the second round 8‚Äì10 to Andy Hamilton despite winning the first four legs of the match. ===2013=== After his exceptional year in 2012, van Gerwen entered the 2013 World Championship as the second favourite behind Phil Taylor. He saw off Paul Lim 3‚Äì0 in the first round to play Peter Wright in the second round, who described van Gerwen as \\"not good enough\\" before the match. Van Gerwen was 0‚Äì2 down but stormed back by winning 12 of the next 14 legs to advance with a 4‚Äì2 win and then beat Colin Lloyd 4‚Äì1 in the third round to face reigning two-time world champion Adrian Lewis in the quarter-finals. The match was a classic as both players averaged over 100, with Lewis coming back from a set down four times to level the match at 4‚Äì4. In the deciding set, Lewis missed two darts at double top for the match, as van Gerwen stepped in to finish 83, 108 and double four in successive legs to seal the win and progress to the semi-final. At 3‚Äì1 up in his semi-final match against James Wade, van Gerwen hit a nine- dart finish. He almost repeated the feat in the very next leg, after hitting eight perfect darts before missing one dart at double 12 that would have seen him become the first player ever to hit back-to-back perfect legs. However, he lost the set and the next as Wade leveled the match, but van Gerwen's superior scoring power eventually told as he won the match 6‚Äì4. In his first World Championship final, he played fifteen-time winner Phil Taylor and led 2‚Äì0 and 4‚Äì2, but crucially missed two darts to lead 5‚Äì2. Taylor then rallied to win five successive sets to take the title 7‚Äì4. Van Gerwen's run in the tournament saw him climb to number four on the Order of Merit, which guaranteed his place in the Premier League for the first time. At the PDC awards dinner in January 2013, van Gerwen won three awards; Young Player of the Year, PDPA Player of the Year and Fans' Player of the Year.https://www.pdc.tv/news/2013/01/02/mvgs- awards-treble-taylor-scoops-top-honour In his first World Cup of Darts, he partnered van Barneveld and the Dutch pair suffered a shock in the last 16 when they were beaten 3‚Äì5 by the Finnish duo of Jani Haavisto and Jarkko Komula. Van Gerwen won his first tournament of 2013 at the first UK Open Qualifier of the year with a 6‚Äì2 victory over Dave Chisnall in the final. He completed a weekend double a day later by defeating Brendan Dolan also by a 6‚Äì2 scoreline in the second Qualifier. The win saw van Gerwen replace Wade as the world number three. His run continued by taking the third event with a 6‚Äì2 win against Michael Smith. Van Gerwen's first defeat on the 2013 Pro Tour came a day later when Robert Thornton beat him 4‚Äì6 in the semi-finals of the fourth Qualifier. His unbeaten run stood at 29 matches until this defeat. Despite losing in the semi-finals of the European Darts Trophy to Paul Nicholson in April, van Gerwen replaced Adrian Lewis as the world number two. He reached another final at the fifth UK Open Qualifier, beating Phil Taylor 6‚Äì2 along the way, but lost 1‚Äì6 to Simon Whitlock. Van Gerwen bounced back a day later to win the sixth event which included a 112.67 average in a 6‚Äì1 win over Michael Smith in the semi-finals and a 6‚Äì5 defeat of Kim Huybrechts in the final. He also won the final event with a 6‚Äì0 ten-minute thrashing of Mervyn King in the final, meaning he had won five of the eight Qualifiers. His sixth title of the year came a week later at the second Players Championship by beating Stuart Kellett 6‚Äì1 in the final. In the 2013 Premier League, van Gerwen became the first player other than Phil Taylor to finish top of the league after Taylor had done it in all eight previous stagings of the event. He won 11, drew two and lost three of his 16 games, averaging over 100 in nine of them. He beat James Wade 8‚Äì4 in the semi-finals to face Taylor in the final. Van Gerwen was 2‚Äì5 down but then won five unanswered legs before Taylor stopped the rot by taking out a finish of 65. In the next leg, van Gerwen declined a dart at the bull when on a finish of 87 to set up 32, but Taylor stepped in to finish 160 to level the match at 7‚Äì7. However, van Gerwen began the 15th leg with a 180 and won two consecutive legs to move within one game of the title. He missed two darts at double eight to win 10‚Äì7, but with Taylor leaving 40 after 12 darts in the next, van Gerwen finished 132 on the bull to become only the fourth player to win the Premier League. Van Gerwen's play continued as he won the European Darts Open in D√ºsseldorf, Germany, saving his best performance for the final where he beat Simon Whitlock 6‚Äì2 with an average of 106.68. Another title followed less than a week later as he won the non-ranking Dubai Darts Masters, taking out finishes of 170 and 164 during an 11‚Äì7 triumph over Raymond van Barneveld in the final. His 10th tournament win came in June at the Austrian Darts Open by beating Mervyn King 6‚Äì3 in the final. It was van Gerwen's fifth title in a row and he was on a run of 24 unbeaten games. He was the number one seed for the UK Open having earned ¬£35,600 in the eight qualifying events, just over ¬£25,000 ahead of Robert Thornton in second place. Van Gerwen stretched his unbeaten streak to 27 games before he met Taylor in the quarter-finals. Van Gerwen did not quite produce his best game as he was beaten 7‚Äì10. Two weeks later he won the sixth Players Championship by defeating Andy Hamilton 6‚Äì1 in the final. At the Gibraltar Darts Trophy his unbeaten run of 15 matches in European Tour events was ended as he lost to Adrian Lewis 5‚Äì6 in the quarter-finals. At the European Championship, van Gerwen beat Mervyn King and Jelle Klaasen both with 104 averages, but was defeated 8‚Äì11 by Lewis in the semi-finals. Lewis was also the victor when the two met at the same stage of the World Matchplay, beating van Gerwen 17‚Äì15. Van Gerwen overcame Lewis in the semi-finals of the Sydney Darts Masters 10‚Äì7, but was then defeated 10‚Äì3 in the final by Taylor. In the defence of his World Grand Prix title, van Gerwen swept past John Part 2‚Äì0 and van Barneveld 3‚Äì0 in 21 minutes to play Dave Chisnall in the quarter-finals. Van Gerwen came from 2‚Äì0 down to level the match but Chisnall halted his momentum by winning the final set by three legs to one. He qualified from Group 5 of the Championship League having lost in the final of two previous groups which included a nine-dart finish in a 6‚Äì5 loss to Terry Jenkins in Group 4. In the Winners Group, van Gerwen was the only player to beat Taylor and he finished second in the table by winning five of his seven games. In the semi-finals, he saw off Richie Burnett 6‚Äì2 to face Taylor in the final. Van Gerwen fell 5‚Äì0 down before winning three successive legs but had left himself too much to do and lost 6‚Äì3. He finished the year as the top seed for the Players Championship Finals having amassed ¬£125,350 during the year in ProTour events, over ¬£50,000 ahead of Chisnall in second place. He produced two superb comebacks in the event, the first coming in the second round when he took six legs in a row to see off Lewis 9‚Äì6. He produced the second in the final as from 6‚Äì3 down he hit a seven leg burst against Taylor and secured his second major title of the year with an 11‚Äì7 victory. ===2014=== In the 2014 World Championship, van Gerwen began with victories over qualifier Zoran Lerchbacher and Kevin McDine. He trailed Gary Anderson 3‚Äì1 in the third round, but came back to win 4‚Äì3. He then faced former BDO World Champion Mark Webster, whom he beat 5‚Äì3, to set up a semi-final meeting against Adrian Lewis. Van Gerwen won with a 6‚Äì0 whitewash and an average of 103.02, having punished Lewis for a multitude of missed doubles during the match. In his second successive World Championship final, he faced Peter Wright and stormed into a 4‚Äì0 lead, before Wright took the next two sets. Van Gerwen made it 6‚Äì2, needing one set to win but his scoring and finishing then faltered, as Wright took the next two sets to make it 6‚Äì4. Van Gerwen took advantage of two missed darts from Wright in the deciding leg of the next set to win 7‚Äì4. He became the sixth different winner of the event and, at the age of 24, the youngest as well as jumping above Phil Taylor to become the new world number one. Later in the month, he won the ProTour Player of the Year, Fans' Player of the Year and PDC Player of the Year at the Annual Awards. On the opening night of the Premier League, van Gerwen registered the first ever whitewash over Taylor in the tournament's history, 7‚Äì0 in 13 minutes with an average of 109.59. He enjoyed a title success in his home country at the Dutch Darts Masters by beating Mervyn King in a high quality final where both players averaged over 107. A week later, he won the final UK Open Qualifier with a 6‚Äì0 whitewash over Michael Smith. At the UK Open, he was beaten 10‚Äì8 in the semi-finals by Terry Jenkins. Van Gerwen won his 20th title on the PDC tour in claiming the second Players Championship by beating Dean Winstanley 6‚Äì1. In April, Taylor won their reverse fixture in the Premier League 7‚Äì4 and was also the victor when the two met in the final of the German Darts Masters. He finished top of the Premier League table for the second year in a row, winning 11 of his 16 games, and then edged past Gary Anderson 8‚Äì7 in the semi-finals. From 5‚Äì5 in the final, Raymond van Barneveld took four successive legs and ended van Gerwen's Premier League reign with a 10‚Äì6 win. He defended his Dubai Duty Free Darts Masters title by seeing off Wright 11‚Äì7. At the World Cup of Darts, van Gerwen and van Barneveld produced a sensational 117.88 average in their doubles decider against Northern Ireland to whitewash them 4‚Äì0 and meet England's Taylor and Lewis in the final. Van Gerwen defeated Taylor 4‚Äì0 and van Barneveld recorded the same scoreline against Lewis. He went into his singles match versus Lewis knowing a win would earn the Dutch pair the title and he did so with a 4‚Äì2 success. Van Gerwen played in his first World Matchplay final this year but couldn't match Taylor's fast start to the match as he trailed 7‚Äì1 and 11‚Äì2 and, despite a rally to pull back to 14‚Äì8, he was beaten 18‚Äì9. The loss left van Gerwen in tears on the stage afterwards. He returned to claim the inaugural Singapore Darts Masters with an 11‚Äì8 victory over Simon Whitlock. A week later he averaged an incredible 118.21 in beating Paul Nicholson 8‚Äì3 in the quarter-finals of the Perth Darts Masters and went on to reach the final where Taylor beat him 11‚Äì9. Van Gerwen also won the 14th Players Championship with a 6‚Äì4 victory over Michael Smith. A week later, they contested the final of the European Darts Trophy, with van Gerwen losing 6‚Äì5 having been 3‚Äì0 ahead. He lost in a deciding leg once more at the 15th Players Championship, to Justin Pipe. His second major title of the year came at the World Grand Prix as he edged a close final against James Wade 5‚Äì3 in sets. Seven days later, he beat Wade once more this time 6‚Äì2 in the final of the 18th Players Championship. He averaged 111 in eliminating Dave Chisnall 10‚Äì5 in the quarter-finals of the European Championship and then threw his fourth career televised nine-darter during an 11‚Äì6 semi-final victory over van Barneveld. Van Gerwen took the first five legs in the final against Terry Jenkins and never looked back as he sealed his sixth PDC major title 11‚Äì4. He was knocked out of the quarter-finals at the Grand Slam 16‚Äì10 by Kim Huybrechts and in the second round of the Players Championship Finals 10‚Äì7 by Terry Jenkins. ===2015=== Van Gerwen progressed to the semi-finals of the 2015 World Championship, which included his then highest World Championship average of 105.26 in beating Robert Thornton in the quarters. He played Gary Anderson in the event for the second year in a row and once again trailed 3‚Äì1 before levelling at 3‚Äì3. However, he missed four darts to take the next set and instead saw his reign as world champion come to end with a 6‚Äì3 loss. Van Gerwen won the Masters by beating van Barneveld 11‚Äì6 in the final with an average of 112.49. He lost in the final of the first UK Open Qualifier 6‚Äì1 to Adrian Lewis, but atoned for this a day later by winning the second event by beating Vincent van der Voort 6‚Äì3. Van Gerwen also took the third event with a 6‚Äì1 triumph over James Wade which meant he had won 25 of 26 matches since the World Championship. He extended this to 30 out of 31 games when he won the German Darts Championship by defeating Anderson 6‚Äì2 in the final with an exceptional average of 117.94. Jelle Klaasen missed a total of ten match darts in the final of the fourth UK Open Qualifier to allow van Gerwen to win 6‚Äì5. A 31 consecutive game winning streak was ended by Terry Jenkins the next day. In the UK Open fifth round, he set his highest televised average of 114.91 during a 9‚Äì2 victory over Kim Huybrechts in which he had a 170 finish and missed one dart for a nine-darter in the final leg. He went on to win his first UK Open title with an 11‚Äì5 victory over Peter Wright in the final. He won his second European Tour event in a row at the Gibraltar Darts Trophy with a 6‚Äì3 success over Terry Jenkins and made it a trio of titles by seeing off John Henderson 6‚Äì5 at the German Darts Masters, which saw him become the second player ever to reach ¬£1 million in prize money on the PDC Order of Merit, after Phil Taylor. He reset his highest televised average record to 116.90 in a 7‚Äì0 whitewash of James Wade in the Premier League. Van Gerwen continued to dominate the PDC circuit by claiming the fourth and sixth Players Championship events with 6‚Äì1 and 6‚Äì5 wins over Lewis and Wade respectively. A 6‚Äì6 draw with Dave Chisnall ensured he would finish top of the Premier League for the third year in a row. He averaged 105.15 during the 172 legs he played during the league phase. Van Gerwen won five legs in a row from 7‚Äì4 down to van Barneveld in the semi-finals which helped him win 10‚Äì8. He could only take out 32% of his doubles in the final against Anderson, including missing seven in one leg, which contributed to him losing 11‚Äì7. Van Gerwen maintained his unbeaten record in the Dubai Darts Masters as he took his third title in a row by recovering from 8‚Äì6 down in the final against Taylor to triumph 11‚Äì8. He stretched his unbeaten run to 20 matches in European Tour events as he claimed the Dutch Darts Masters by whitewashing Justin Pipe 6‚Äì0. Van Gerwen and van Barneveld were knocked out in the semi-finals of the World Cup in a doubles match against Scotland's Anderson and Wright. Van Gerwen won his first World Matchplay title by beating James Wade 18‚Äì12. It saw him overtake Wade as the PDC's second most successful player with nine major tournament wins, but still a long way behind Taylor who leads with 79. Michael Smith defeated van Gerwen 6‚Äì2 in the final of the European Darts Trophy, but he took the European Darts Matchplay seven days later with a 6‚Äì4 success over Chisnall in the final. Van Gerwen hit 18 180s in the final of the World Grand Prix against Robert Thornton, but ultimately missed too many doubles to be edged out 5‚Äì4 in sets. He looked set to lose a second successive major final when he trailed Gary Anderson 10‚Äì7 at the European Championship, but won the next four legs without allowing the Scot a dart for the match to win 11‚Äì10. It marked the first time van Gerwen had retained a major title. Van Gerwen was untroubled in reaching the final of the Grand Slam which included a 16‚Äì4 victory over Kim Huybrechts in the quarter-finals whilst averaging 111.05. In the final, he was 3‚Äì0 and 7‚Äì3 behind Taylor, but won six unanswered legs and went on to take the tournament with a 16‚Äì13 win. The title completed van Gerwen's set of winning all of the PDC's current majors during his career. In the final of the World Series of Darts Finals, van Gerwen came from 10‚Äì9 down to defeat Wright 11‚Äì10 with a 129 checkout and an 11-dart leg. He took his fourth televised title in a row at the Players Championship Finals with an 11‚Äì6 win over Adrian Lewis. It also ensured he had featured in every televised final since the World Championship at the start of the year. ===2016=== After needing a tie-break to beat Ren√© Eidams in the first round of the 2016 World Championship, Van Gerwen recorded 109.23, the fourth-highest average ever recorded in the event during a 4‚Äì0 whitewash over Darren Webster. In the third round, he took out a 135 finish to send his tie with van Barneveld to a deciding set. Van Barneveld went 2‚Äì0 up in legs before van Gerwen threw a 10-dart leg, but he missed one dart to level the game in the next leg allowing his Dutch rival to finish on 96 to knock him out. Van Gerwen's average of 105.78 was at the time the highest ever to lose a match in the history of the event. Phil Taylor missed seven match darts in the semi-finals of the Masters and van Gerwen took full advantage to eliminate him 11‚Äì10 and retained his title by easing past Dave Chisnall 11‚Äì6. In week four of the Premier League, van Gerwen broke the televised average record with 123.40 in a 7‚Äì1 win over Michael Smith.https://dartsnews.com/pdc/throwback-video-van-gerwens-world- record-123-average-against-smith-in-premier-league-darts In the following round of fixtures, he averaged 116.67 in beating Peter Wright 7‚Äì2. A 7‚Äì5 win over Taylor saw van Gerwen top the final Premier League table for the fourth year in a row. He won his second Premier League title (his first being in 2013) with an 11‚Äì3 victory over Taylor in what was van Gerwen's fourth consecutive Premier League final. Taylor had led 2‚Äì1 but van Gerwen soon took control of proceedings and won ten of the following eleven legs to complete a resounding win. Van Gerwen had won three of the six UK Open Qualifiers and in the fourth round of the main event he produced his fifth televised nine-dart finish whilst defeating Rob Cross 9‚Äì5. He also hit 170 finishes in the leg before and after the perfect leg. He recovered from 4‚Äì1 down to Taylor in the semi-finals to win 10‚Äì6 and, in a repeat of last year's final, bested Wright 11‚Äì4 to retain his title. Van Gerwen won his second consecutive World Matchplay title with a comfortable 18‚Äì10 win over Taylor. It was 15-time winner Taylor's first defeat in a Matchplay final and only his eighth defeat in the tournament since 1994. He did suffer an 11‚Äì5 loss to Taylor in the final of the inaugural Champions League of Darts, but then set a record average in a World Grand Prix final of 100.29 as he beat Anderson 5‚Äì2. Van Gerwen claimed six of the ten European Tour events, five Players Championships and two World Series tournaments, as well as taking the main event of each of these tours, the European Championship (averaged 111.62 in an 11‚Äì1 victory over Mensur Suljoviƒá), the World Series of Darts (beat Peter Wright 11‚Äì9) and the Players Championship Finals (overcame Dave Chisnall 11‚Äì3). He also retained his Grand Slam crown courtesy of seeing off James Wade 16‚Äì8 in the final. His domination of the PDC circuit saw him win a total of 25 titles and ¬£1.5 million in 2016, with a match success rate of 91%. ===2017=== Van Gerwen at the 2017 German Darts Grand Prix Van Gerwen averaged over 100 in each of his four matches as he advanced to the semi-finals of the 2017 World Championship without facing a player in the top 20 on the Order of Merit. Raymond van Barneveld won the first set without reply in the semis, but van Gerwen then produced the greatest ever World Championship performance as he averaged a tournament record 114.05 (32 legs) in a 6‚Äì2 win. It beat Phil Taylor's previous best of 111.21 (23 legs) in the second round of the 2002 World Championship. In the last set, van Gerwen missed a dart at double 12 for a nine-darter. In the final, Gary Anderson left 28 to take a 3‚Äì1 lead, but van Gerwen finished 86 to snipe that set, leveling the match at 2‚Äì2. Van Gerwen ultimately took 12 of the next 14 legs to establish a 6‚Äì2 lead. He got over the line to take his second World Championship crown with a 7‚Äì3 win. With this victory, he held all seven PDC major ranking titles at the same time. 42 180s were thrown in the final, the most ever in a darts match and van Gerwen's average of 107.79 brought his average over the whole tournament to 106.32. The win cemented his number one ranking as he was over ¬£1 million ahead of second placed Anderson. Van Gerwen won his third successive Masters title by defeating Anderson 11‚Äì7 in the final, finishing with a 109.42 average. Van Gerwen threw two nine-darters during his third round 6‚Äì2 win over Ryan Murray at the fourth UK Open Qualifier and he would take the title by beating Anderson 6‚Äì3 in the decider. He could not defend his UK Open title because he was forced to withdraw from the event due to a back injury. In the 2017 edition of the Premier League, van Gerwen successfully defended his title, topping the table of the league stage once again by winning nine matches, drawing four and losing two. After overcoming Anderson 10‚Äì7 in the semi-final, he would go on to face Peter Wright in the final. The Scotsman was leading 7‚Äì2 but van Gerwen staged a remarkable comeback to level at 8‚Äì8. Wright then had the title for the taking at 10‚Äì9, but missed six consecutive match darts to allow van Gerwen to again level and a 12-dart leg against the throw gave the Dutchman his third Premier League title, with a tournament average of 104.76. At the World Cup, Netherlands secured their first title since 2014 by seeing off the Welsh pairing of Gerwyn Price and Mark Webster 3‚Äì1 in the final. At the 2017 World Matchplay in July, van Gerwen failed in his attempt to retain the title he won in 2016. He eased to wins over Stephen Bunting 10‚Äì4 and Simon Whitlock 11‚Äì3 but suffered a heavy 16‚Äì6 defeat at the hands of Phil Taylor in the quarter finals. At the Champions League of Darts in Cardiff, van Gerwen failed to get out of the group stages he lost his opening match 10‚Äì5 to Raymond van Barneveld. He then defeated Adrian Lewis 10‚Äì4 meaning he needed to win his final group game against Phil Taylor without losing 7 legs in the match. Van Gerwen went on to lose 10‚Äì9. At the 2017 World Grand Prix in October, the tournament in which van Gerwen claimed his maiden PDC Major televised title in 2012, van Gerwen suffered a surprise first round exit to Scotsman John Henderson 2 sets to 1 it marked the first time van Gerwen had lost in the opening round in the event since 2009 he was bidding to win the tournament for the fourth time in six years. Following early exits in the Champions League and the World Grand Prix, van Gerwen went back to winning ways by claiming his 4th European Championship title by defeating Rob Cross 11‚Äì7. Notably in his semi-final clash with Kyle Anderson, van Gerwen was on the receiving end of a 9 darter and his Australian opponent had missed two match darts to progress to the final but the Dutchman prevailed, winning 11‚Äì10. Van Gerwen's next tournament was the Grand Slam of Darts, winning all 3 of his group games to top Group A. He defeated Steve Lennon in the last 16 by a convincing 10‚Äì3 win. Van Gerwen followed this by defeating Rob Cross 16‚Äì13 in the quarter-finals, a 16‚Äì8 win over 6 time Grand Slam winner Phil Taylor in the semi-finals and a 16‚Äì12 win over Peter Wright in the final to claim his 3rd Grand Slam title. ===2018=== Van Gerwen won his first two matches in the World Championship against Christian Kist and James Wilson respectively. In his third round match against Price, van Gerwen won 4‚Äì2 despite losing seven legs in a row. In the quarter-final, van Gerwen faced Raymond van Barneveld. Van Gerwen led 4 sets to 3 and was throwing first in set 8, but van Barneveld took out 84 in the fifth leg of that set after van Gerwen had missed one match dart at double 12. This clutch finish sent the match to a deciding set. With the ninth set level at 1 leg each, van Barneveld missed three darts at double 16 to move within one leg of the match, and van Gerwen stepped in to finish 96 to break. Van Gerwen held his throw in the subsequent leg to win the match 5‚Äì4. In the semi-final, van Gerwen faced World Championship debutant Rob Cross. The first eight sets went with throw, then van Gerwen broke to go 5‚Äì4 ahead. In set 10, with van Gerwen throwing first, he lost his throw to fall behind two legs to one. He then missed six darts to send the set into a fifth leg (In which he would have been throwing for the match), allowing Cross to step in to level the match at five sets apiece. The first four legs of the deciding set were shared to send the set into a tie-break. The next four legs went with throw (Although Cross did miss one match dart at the bullseye to win the set 4‚Äì2), then van Gerwen broke to go 5‚Äì4 up. He then missed five shots at a double to win the match, before Cross sent the match into a sudden death last leg. After Cross won the bull-off to gain the throw, he missed double 16 for a match-winning 140 checkout. This allowed van Gerwen one last gasp at a finish of 108. He got a shot at double 16, but couldn't take it, which was his sixth missed match dart. Cross put the match to rest by hitting double eight to win the sudden death last leg, stunning van Gerwen 6 sets to 5. His next televised tournament was the Masters, where he took his fourth consecutive win at the tournament beating his compatriot Raymond van Barneveld in the final with a 105 average, after earlier wins over Gary Anderson, James Wade and Kim Huybrechts. At the first Pro Tour event of 2018, UK Open Qualifier 1, he beat Michael Smith in the final, averaging 105 for the tournament. He took his hundredth PDC singles title at the next UK Open Qualifier with a win over Darren Webster in the final, becoming the second player to do so after Phil Taylor. He lost at the quarter final stage of the third qualifier to Smith, putting his earnings from the qualifiers over ¬£20,000. Despite sitting out the final three qualifiers, his performances at the first three events was enough for him to top the UK Open Order of Merit and enter at the third round of the tournament. Drawn against Jeffrey de Zwaan, he lost 8‚Äì10 with a 96 average. This was the first time since 2012 he exited before the quarter final stage at the tournament, and the first time he lost his first match of a televised tournament since the World Grand Prix the year prior. After sitting out both Players Championship 3 and Players Championship 4, he returned to form with his third Players Championship of the year, and sixth 2018 title overall, with a 6‚Äì2 victory over Chris Dobey in Players Championship 5. On the following day he lost to Jermaine Wattimena in Players Championship 6, his earliest loss since he was beaten by Vincent van der Voort at the same stage of Players Championship 19 in 2017. At the first European Tour event of 2018, the European Darts Open, he took his 21st European Tour title with an 8‚Äì7 victory over Peter Wright. Van Gerwen and Wright would play each other again in the final of the 2018 German Darts Grand Prix, with van Gerwen prevailing once again by a scoreline of 8‚Äì5. It was his 22nd European Tour title. After sitting out of Players Championships 7 and 8 he attempted to win his third European Tour title of the season but was beaten in the quarter-finals 2‚Äì6 by Ian White. He pulled out of the Austrian Open (the 4th European Tour event) but then returned to winning ways in Players Championship 9 by beating Scott Taylor 6‚Äì4 in the final. Van Gerwen played in the 10th Players Championship where he was beaten 4‚Äì6 by Jonny Clayton in the quarter-finals. Van Gerwen won the European Darts Grand Prix, his 23rd European Tour title and his 10th title of the year that included wins over Dave Chisnall in quarter-finals by a scoreline of 6‚Äì4, a 7‚Äì0 whitewash over Michael Smith in the semi-finals and an 8‚Äì3 victory over James Wade in the final. The following week, he won his 11th title of the year (his 24th European Tour title) by winning his 5th consecutive Dutch Darts Masters by beating Steve Lennon 8‚Äì5 in the final. Notably, in his semi-final match with Daryl Gurney, van Gerwen trailed 2‚Äì6 as well as surviving 3 match darts but the Dutchman produced a comeback performance to knock out the Northern Irishman 7‚Äì6. His 12th title of the year followed shortly after on the 17th May in winning the Premier League by beating Rob Cross 10‚Äì6 in the semi-finals and a comprehensive 11‚Äì4 victory over Michael Smith in the final with an average of 112.37, the highest ever average in a Premier League final. It was his 3rd consecutive Premier League title and his 4th Premier League title overall. The first World Series of Darts event of 2018, the German Masters, saw a loss to Dimitri Van Den Bergh in the quarter-finals. His 13th title of the year would follow shortly after in the World Cup of Darts with partner Raymond van Barneveld. They successfully defended their title for The Netherlands with a 3‚Äì1 victory over Scottish pairing Peter Wright and Gary Anderson. The following weekend saw him win his 14th title of the year and his 25th European Tour title with a victory in the Gibraltar Darts Trophy by beating Adrian Lewis 8‚Äì3 in the final with an average of over 108. 2 weeks later saw a surprising defeat to Brendan Dolan in round 3 of the Danish Open. The following week he was back to winning ways with his 15th title of the year and his 26th European Tour title in the European Matchplay with an 8‚Äì2 victory over William O'Connor in the final. He also threw the first nine-dart finish in over 5 years on the European Tour in his 2nd round match against Ryan Joyce. Van Gerwen's reign as the US Masters and Shanghai Darts Masters champion would come to end as he suffered loses to James Wade 3‚Äì8 in the quarter finals and to Michael Smith 4‚Äì8 in the semi- finals respectively. Van Gerwen's next televised tournament was the World Matchplay. Drawn against Jeffrey de Zwaan in the first round, van Gerwen lost 6‚Äì10 to his compatriot. It was van Gerwen's 2nd loss to de Zwaan following his previous defeat at the UK Open back in March. Van Gerwen returned to the winning circle by claiming his first World Series of Darts title of 2018 by defeating compatriot Raymond van Barneveld 11‚Äì4 at the final of the Auckland Darts Masters final. It was van Gerwen's 16th title of 2018. Van Gerwen lifted the 2018 World Grand Prix title, the fourth time he had won that title, with a 5‚Äì2 win over Peter Wright. He failed to retain the European Championship, World Series Finals and Grand Slam titles in 2018, and lost the final of the 2018 Players Championship Finals to Daryl Gurney. ===2019=== Van Gerwen during the 280px Van Gerwen was top seed at the 2019 PDC World Darts Championship. He knocked Alan Tabern out in the second round despite having beer thrown at him during the walk on, before consecutive 4‚Äì1 victories over Max Hopp and former world champion Adrian Lewis. He beat Ryan Joyce 5‚Äì1 in the quarter-final to set up a semi-final with Gary Anderson. A dominant semi-final performance by the Dutchman saw him triumph 6‚Äì1 over Anderson, to reach the final against Michael Smith. He regained the world championship with a 7‚Äì3 win over Smith. Van Gerwen kicked off the 2019 circuit with winning the 2019 Masters, defeating James Wade 11‚Äì5 in the final to secure his fifth consecutive Masters title. The next two weeks, van Gerwen won Players Championship 1 and 3, henceforth breaking Phil Taylor's ProTour title record. He retained his Premier League title yet again, beating Daryl Gurney 10‚Äì7 in the semifinals, and beating Rob Cross 11‚Äì5 in the final. The first two World Series events of 2019 did not go well for him, suffering an 8‚Äì6 defeat to Michael Smith in the quarterfinals of the 2019 US Darts Masters, and blowing a 5‚Äì1 lead to lose 6‚Äì5 to qualifier Martin Schindler in the first round of the 2019 German Darts Masters. Van Gerwen then continued his very poor run of form at the World Matchplay, losing 13‚Äì11 to Glen Durrant in the last 16. Van Gerwen once again failed to get out of the quarterfinals in the 2019 Brisbane Darts Masters, losing 8‚Äì5 to Gurney. He finally got back to winning ways in Melbourne and New Zealand, winning those finals by scores of 8‚Äì3 and 8‚Äì1 over Gurney and Van Barneveld respectively. Van Gerwen retained his World Grand Prix title with a win over Dave Chisnall, and won the Champions League of Darts for the first time, recovering from three legs down to beat Peter Wright 11‚Äì10. He regained his Players Championship Finals title, beating Gerwyn Price in the final, and hitting the only televised nine-dart finish of the year, in the second round against Adrian Lewis. ===2020=== Van Gerwen was again top seed at the 2020 PDC World Darts Championship. He easily reached the quarter-final, recovering from losing the first set to Jelle Klaasen in the second round to win, before consecutive 4‚Äì0 victories over Ricky Evans and former BDO World Champion Stephen Bunting. In the quarter-final, he triumphed over Darius Labanauskas, 5‚Äì2, to qualify for the semi-final for the seventh time in eight championships. There he beat Nathan Aspinall 6‚Äì3 to set up a final with Peter Wright. Van Gerwen was defeated in that final, 7‚Äì3. At the 2020 Masters, van Gerwen lost in the first round to Jonny Clayton, ending his run of 5 years as the tournament‚Äôs champion, and a 20 match unbeaten run at the Marshall Arena. ==Playing style== Van Gerwen leans quite a lot forward on the oche and throws at a very fast pace and scores extremely heavily meaning he is able to build up momentum over his opponents in a matter of seconds. When he does make a mistake he is usually able to confine it to history and refocus on the next leg. His playing style is instinctive and natural. He is known to hit purple patches during matches, where he can instantly elevate his game to exceptionally high levels. He did so in winning the first three PDC major titles of his career, firstly in the 2012 Grand Prix final he came back from 1‚Äì4 down in sets to triumph 6‚Äì4 and in the 2013 Premier League final he came from 2‚Äì5 down to win five successive legs and eventually won 10‚Äì8. Thirdly, he won seven consecutive legs against Phil Taylor in claiming the 2013 Players Championship Finals title. He is also capable of taking out big checkouts to win matches when his opponent is well placed. The most striking examples of his ability to date include setting a televised average world record of 123.40 in the 2016 Premier League in a 7‚Äì1 victory over Michael Smith. Having started with four 11-dart legs or better in the first six legs, he missed double 18 three times for an average of over 130 which would have earned a shutout win had he found the double. He was also a double 12 away from hitting back-to- back nine-dart finishes in the 2013 World Championship semi-finals. Five-time World Champion Eric Bristow has described him as fearless, and van Gerwen has said he is not scared of any player. He celebrates important visits to the board with sudden short-range headbutts and a bouncing double fist-pump. Such exuberant celebrations have created negative reactions among some of his fellow players, with 2004 World Masters winner Mervyn King calling it disrespectful. It has been suggested that consistency could be the only thing that will stop van Gerwen from dominating the sport for years to come. ==Personal life== In August 2014, van Gerwen married his longtime girlfriend, Daphne Govers. They have a daughter born in August 2017 and a son born in April 2020. In December 2014, Sky Sports televised a one-hour documentary called \\"Mighty Mike\\" which charted his rise in darts as well as his life away from the sport. He is a supporter of the Dutch football club PSV Eindhoven. In May 2018, he was awarded the Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau Medal by his local Mayor on behalf of Willem-Alexander, King of Netherlands. ==World championship resultsBDO=== * 2007: First round (lost to Gary Robson 2‚Äì3) ===PDC=== * 2008: First round (lost to Phil Taylor 2‚Äì3) * 2009: Second round (lost to Phil Taylor 0‚Äì4) * 2010: Second round (lost to James Wade 2‚Äì4) * 2011: First round (lost to Mensur Suljoviƒá 1‚Äì3) * 2012: Third round (lost to Simon Whitlock 3‚Äì4) * 2013: Runner-up (lost to Phil Taylor 4‚Äì7) * 2014: Winner (beat Peter Wright 7‚Äì4) * 2015: Semi-finals (lost to Gary Anderson 3‚Äì6) * 2016: Third round (lost to Raymond van Barneveld 3‚Äì4) * 2017: Winner (beat Gary Anderson 7‚Äì3) * 2018: Semi-finals (lost to Rob Cross 5‚Äì6) * 2019: Winner (beat Michael Smith 7‚Äì3) * 2020: Runner-up (lost to Peter Wright 3‚Äì7) ==Career finalsBDO major finals: 1 (1 title)=== {  -

Due to a sandbar in the river, although the falls did not begin until the river reached Richmond and Manchester, Warwick was as far upriver as many ships of the day could safely navigate. Regarding navigation on the James River, in his Notes on the State of Virginia, written in 1781‚Äì82, then-Governor Thomas Jefferson stated \\"Vessels of 250 tons may go to Warwick\\" In 1619, Falling Creek Ironworks was established in the Virginia Colony near the future site of Warwick. The first in what became the United States, the facilities were destroyed and most of the colonists there killed during the Indian Massacre of 1622 on Good Friday, March 22, 1622. Warwick, just west of where a local tributary, Falling Creek, has its confluence with the river, was in existence from 1730 to 1781. It was an important port and manufacturing center. During the American Revolutionary War, Warwick's craftsmen turned out clothing and shoes, and its mills ground flour and meal for the Continental troops stationed at Chesterfield Courthouse. It was also an important center for manufacturing of naval equipment for Virginia's Continental Navy fleet.. Stewart, Robert A. (1934). The History of Virginia's Navy of the Revolution.

The town of Warwick no longer exists, but its place in history is noted on a Virginia Historical Marker nearby. In modern times, the Port of Richmond's facility known locally as Richmond Deepwater Terminal includes part of the former site of Warwick. ==Warwick Road== Portions of the original Warwick Road extended from the port town of Warwick through Colonel Archibald Cary's Ampthill Plantation (which is now part of the large DuPont Plant), annexed areas of Chesterfield which are now part of South Richmond, and back into Chesterfield County to reach the Bon Air area. Much of the original Warwick Road was intact as a through route until around 1960. ==References * Port of Richmond - Richmond (VA) website Category:Geography of Chesterfield County, Virginia Category:Ghost towns in Virginia ","title":"Warwick, Virginia (Chesterfield County)"},{"id":"7451883","text":"Arshak Petrosian, Warsaw 2013 Arshak B.

Sago Lane () is a one-way lane in Chinatown within the Outram Planning Area in Singapore. The street links Banda Street to Neil Road. In the past, the street was much longer and was home to funeral parlours or death houses. Part of the street was demolished in the late 1960s due to the construction of the new HDB development at Kreta Ayer, also known as Chinatown Complex. Currently the street, is mainly used during Chinese New Year as part of the festive bazaar in Chinatown. Some mistaken Sago Street as sei yan gai or the \\"street of the dead\\", but it's actually on Sago Lane. Sago Street was where brothels were located. Sago Lane is known as ho ba ni au koi in Hokkien, which literally means \\"the street behind Ho Man Nin\\". Ho Man Nin is the chop of a well known singing hall in neighbouring Sago Street. ==Etymology and history== 19th century: The lane received its name because during the 1840s, there were numerous sago factories in both Sago Street and Lane. The sago was then taken from the powdery pith of the trunk of the rumbia palm and processed into flour that was used to make desserts, textile starch and hospital food. After processing, it was mostly re-exported to Europe and India. Sago became a staple export item for Singapore in 1834. In 1849, there were 15 Chinese and 2 European Sago factories in the area.Sago lane and Sago street became a prosperous manufacturing centre.Naidu Ratnala Thulaja, ‚ÄúSago Lane‚Äù, Singapore Infopedia, National Library Board, 2003. Accessed February 12, 2016. http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_299_2005-01-11.html During the 1850s, there were thirty sago factories in the town which had a total output of 8,000 tons annually. Many of the sago factories were in the Sago Street area. Sago lane in particular, was occupied by the Cantonese.\\"History of Chinatown.\\" Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum. 2011. Accessed February 12, 2016. http://www.btrts.org.sg/history-of-chinatown. Many of these factory workers lived in the area of these factories, and the areas surrounding Sago Lane and Street soon became a hub for many traders, coolies, hawkers, peddlers, shops and brothels.\\"A Humble Beginning.\\" Chinatown Singapore. 2012.

Early 20th century: As the area developed in the 1920s, most of the sago factories began to disappear in both streets. In the 1920s, the lane was used as a jinriksha station in Chinatown where Japanese and Chinese brothels moved into Sago street. The lane's famous Chinese death houses or funeral homes came into existence in the late 19th century. This was the place where people near death will be left to die, with the funeral parlour prepared below. Sago lane also became a popular station to cater to the popular entertainment zone next door, Ho-man-nin, as it's often named 'Ho man in hau pin kai' or ‚ÄòThe street behind Ho-man-nin‚Äô.

Following the funeral homes, shops that sold coffins and Chinese paraphernalia including incense paper, funeral clothing etcetera, relating to Chinese funerals started to open along the street. However, the street does not only provide death services. There was an open market that lined the streets of Sago lane. As Chinese funerals were extended affairs that took place for many days, the wet market stalls would convert to food stalls in the evening to cater to mourners and visitors of the dead.

The aim is to determine the flow rates and pressure drops in the individual sections of the network. This is a common problem in hydraulic design. == Description == To direct water to many users, municipal water supplies often route it through a water supply network. A major part of this network will consist of interconnected pipes. This network creates a special class of problems in hydraulic design, with solution methods typically referred to as pipe network analysis. Water utilities generally make use of specialized software to automatically solve these problems. However, many such problems can also be addressed with simpler methods, like a spreadsheet equipped with a solver, or a modern graphing calculator. ==Deterministic network analysis== Once the friction factors of the pipes are obtained (or calculated from pipe friction laws such as the Darcy-Weisbach equation), we can consider how to calculate the flow rates and head losses on the network. Generally the head losses (potential differences) at each node are neglected, and a solution is sought for the steady-state flows on the network, taking into account the pipe specifications (lengths and diameters), pipe friction properties and known flow rates or head losses. The steady-state flows on the network must satisfy two conditions: # At any junction, the total flow into a junction equals the total flow out of that junction (law of conservation of mass, or continuity law, or Kirchhoff's first law) # Between any two junctions, the head loss is independent of the path taken (law of conservation of energy, or Kirchhoff's second law). This is equivalent mathematically to the statement that on any closed loop in the network, the head loss around the loop must vanish. right If there are sufficient known flow rates, so that the system of equations given by (1) and (2) above is closed (number of unknowns = number of equations), then a deterministic solution can be obtained. The classical approach for solving these networks is to use the Hardy Cross method. In this formulation, first you go through and create guess values for the flows in the network. These initial guesses must satisfy the Kirchhoff laws (1). That is, if Q7 enters a junction and Q6 and Q4 leave the same junction, then the initial guess must satisfy Q7 = Q6 + Q4. After the initial guess is made, then, a loop is considered so that we can evaluate our second condition. Given a starting node, we work our way around the loop in a clockwise fashion, as illustrated by Loop 1. We add up the head losses according to the Darcy‚ÄìWeisbach equation for each pipe if Q is in the same direction as our loop like Q1, and subtract the head loss if the flow is in the reverse direction, like Q4. In other words, we add the head losses around the loop in the direction of the loop; depending on whether the flow is with or against the loop, some pipes will have head losses and some will have head gains (negative losses). To satisfy the Kirchhoff's second laws (2), we should end up with 0 about each loop at the steady-state solution. If the actual sum of our head loss is not equal to 0, then we will adjust all the flows in the loop by an amount given by the following formula, where a positive adjustment is in the clockwise direction. : \\\\Delta Q = - \\\\frac{ \\\\sum{\\\\scriptstyle\\\\text{head loss}_c} - \\\\sum{\\\\scriptstyle\\\\text{head loss}_{cc}}}{n \\\\cdot (\\\\sum\\\\frac{\\\\text{head loss}_c}{Q_c} + \\\\sum\\\\frac{\\\\text{head loss}_{cc}}{Q_{cc}})}, where *n is 1.85 for Hazen- Williams and *n is 2 for Darcy‚ÄìWeisbach. The clockwise specifier (c) means only the flows that are moving clockwise in our loop, while the counter- clockwise specifier (cc) is only the flows that are moving counter-clockwise. This adjustment doesn't solve the problem, since most networks have several loops. It is okay to use this adjustment, however, because the flow changes won't alter condition 1, and therefore, the other loops still satisfy condition 1. However, we should use the results from the first loop before we progress to other loops. An adaptation of this method is needed to account for water reservoirs attached to the network, which are joined in pairs by the use of 'pseudo-loops' in the Hardy Cross scheme. This is discussed further on the Hardy Cross method site. The modern method is simply to create a set of conditions from the above Kirchhoff laws (junctions and head-loss criteria). Then, use a Root-finding algorithm to find Q values that satisfy all the equations. The literal friction loss equations use a term called Q2, but we want to preserve any changes in direction. Create a separate equation for each loop where the head losses are added up, but instead of squaring Q, use Q¬∑Q instead (with Q the absolute value of Q) for the formulation so that any sign changes reflect appropriately in the resulting head-loss calculation. == Probabilistic network analysis == In many situations, especially for real water distribution networks in cities (which can extend between thousands to millions of nodes), the number of known variables (flow rates and/or head losses) required to obtain a deterministic solution will be very large. Many of these variables will not be known, or will involve considerable uncertainty in their specification. Furthermore, in many pipe networks, there may be considerable variability in the flows, which can be described by fluctuations about mean flow rates in each pipe. The above deterministic methods are unable to account for these uncertainties, whether due to lack of knowledge or flow variability. For these reasons, a probabilistic method for pipe network analysis has recently been developed,S.H. Waldrip, R.K. Niven, M. Abel, M. Schlegel (2016), Maximum entropy analysis of hydraulic pipe flow networks, J. Hydraulic Eng ASCE, 142(9): 04016028, https://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001126#sthash.5ecR2Gts.dpuf based on the maximum entropy method of Jaynes. In this method, a continuous relative entropy function is defined over the unknown parameters. This entropy is then maximized subject to the constraints on the system, including Kirchhoff's laws, pipe friction properties and any specified mean flow rates or head losses, to give a probabilistic statement (probability density function) which describes the system. This can be used to calculate mean values (expectations) of the flow rates, head losses or any other variables of interest in the pipe network. This analysis has been extended using a reduced- parameter entropic formulation, which ensures consistency of the analysis regardless of the graphical representation of the network.Waldrip, S.H., Niven, R.K., Abel, M., Schlegel, M. (2017), Reduced-parameter method for maximum entropy analysis of hydraulic pipe flow networks, J. Hydraulic Eng ASCE, in press A comparison of Bayesian and maximum entropy probabilistic formulations for the analysis of pipe flow networks has also been presented, showing that under certain assumptions (Gaussian priors), the two approaches lead to equivalent predictions of mean flow rates.Waldrip, S.H., Niven, R.K. (2017), Comparison between Bayesian and maximum entropy analyses of flow networks, Entropy, 19(2): 58, https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e19020058 Other methods of stochastic optimization of water distribution systems rely on metaheuristic algorithms, such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. ==See also References Further reading== *N.

He was never titular prime minister, and never held an office of high rank, but was largely considered a de facto prime minister and was well regarded by his contemporaries. Zhou She was an eighth- generation descendant of the famed Jin official Zhou Yi (Âë®È°ó). His father Zhou Yong (Âë®È°í) was a Southern Qi official. When Zhou She was young, he became known for his skills in rhetoric, and he was retained by Wang Liang (Áéã‰∫Æ), then the mayor of the capital Jiankang, to serve as his secretary. When Emperor Wu of Liang seized the throne from Emperor He of Southern Qi in 502, he sought out people with talent to serve in his administration. His prime minister Fan Yun was friendly with Zhou She's father Zhou Yong, and he recommended Zhou She, whom Emperor Wu made a low level official and gradually promoted. In 503, Fan died, and Emperor Wu entrusted the important matters of state to Zhou She and Xu Mian, effectively making them co-prime ministers, even though neither carried the title and neither received particularly high rank. For the next 20 years, Zhou and Xu served together in this key capacity. Zhou was considered capable and honest and particularly frugal in his living. In 524, a letter was from Bai Wo (ÁôΩÊ∏¶), a commandery governor, was uncovered, in which Bai promised Zhou a large bribe. While there was no evidence showing that Zhou actually received the letter or acted on Bai's behalf, Emperor Wu relieved Zhou from his post. Zhou died later that year, and Emperor Wu, regretting relieving Zhou of his post, issued two edicts greatly praising Zhou for his service and personally attended his wake. He also gave Zhou the posthumous name of Viscount Jian‚Äîalthough there was no record in history indicating that Emperor Wu ever created Zhou a viscount while he was alive or posthumously. == References == * Book of Liang. * History of Southern Dynasties. * Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 145.

Log oxygen fugacity vs temperature at 1 bar pressure for common buffer assemblages, plotted from algorithms compiled by B. R. Frost.B. R. Frost in Mineralogical Society of America \\"Reviews in Mineralogy\\" Volume 25, \\"Oxide Minerals: Petrologic and Magnetic Significance\\" (D. H. Lindsley, editor) (1991) (MH, magnetite-hematite; NiNiO, Nickel-nickel oxide; FMQ, fayalite-magnetite-quartz; WM, wustite-magnetite; IW, iron- wustite; QIF, quartz-iron-fayalite) In geology, a redox buffer is an assemblage of minerals or compounds that constrains oxygen fugacity as a function of temperature. Knowledge of the redox conditions (or equivalently, oxygen fugacities) at which a rock forms and evolves can be important for interpreting the rock history. Iron, sulfur, and manganese are three of the relatively abundant elements in the Earth's crust that occur in more than one oxidation state. For instance, iron, the fourth most abundant element in the crust, exists as native iron, ferrous iron (Fe2+), and ferric iron (Fe3+). The redox state of a rock affects the relative proportions of the oxidation states of these elements and hence may determine both the minerals present and their compositions. If a rock contains pure minerals that constitute a redox buffer, then the oxygen fugacity of equilibration is defined by one of the curves in the accompanying fugacity-temperature diagram. == Common redox buffers and mineralogy == Redox buffers were developed in part to control oxygen fugacities in laboratory experiments to investigate mineral stabilities and rock histories. Each of the curves plotted in the fugacity-temperature diagram is for an oxidation reaction occurring in a buffer. These redox buffers are listed here in order of decreasing oxygen fugacity at a given temperature‚Äîin other words, from more oxidizing to more reducing conditions in the plotted temperature range. As long as all the pure minerals (or compounds) are present in a buffer assemblage, the oxidizing conditions are fixed on the curve for that buffer. Pressure has only a minor influence on these buffer curves for conditions in the Earth's crust.

Within a rock of a given chemical composition, iron enters minerals based on the bulk chemical composition and the mineral phases which are stable at that temperature and pressure. For instance, at redox conditions more oxidizing than the MH (magnetite-hematite) buffer, at least much of the iron is likely to be present as Fe3+ and hematite is a likely mineral in iron-bearing rocks. Iron may only enter minerals such as olivine if it is present as Fe2+; Fe3+ cannot enter the lattice of fayalite olivine. Elements in olivine such as magnesium, however, stabilize olivine containing Fe2+ to conditions more oxidizing than those required for fayalite stability. Solid solution between magnetite and the titanium-bearing endmember, ulvospinel, enlarges the stability field of magnetite. Likewise, at conditions more reducing than the IW (iron-wustite) buffer, minerals such as pyroxene can still contain Fe3+. The redox buffers therefore are only approximate guides to the proportions of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in minerals and rocks. ===Igneous rocks=== Terrestrial igneous rocks commonly record crystallization at oxygen fugacities more oxidizing than the WM (w√ºstite-magnetite) buffer and more reduced than a log unit or so above the nickel-nickel oxide (NiNiO) buffer. Their oxidizing conditions thus are not far from those of the FMQ (fayalite-magnetite-quartz) redox buffer. Nonetheless, there are systematic differences that correlate with tectonic setting. Igneous rock emplaced and erupted in island arcs typically record oxygen fugacities 1 or more log units more oxidizing than those of the NiNiO buffer. In contrast, basalt and gabbro in non-arc settings typically record oxygen fugacities from about those of the FMQ buffer to a log unit or so more reducing than that buffer. ===Sedimentary rocks=== Oxidizing conditions are common in some environments of deposition and diagenesis of sedimentary rocks. The fugacity of oxygen at the MH buffer (magnetite- hematite) is only about 10‚àí70 at 25 ¬∞C, but it is about 0.2 atmospheres in the Earth's atmosphere, so some sedimentary environments are far more oxidizing than those in magmas. Other sedimentary environments, such as the environments for formation of black shale, are relatively reducing. ===Metamorphic rocks=== Oxygen fugacities during metamorphism extend to higher values than those in magmatic environments, because of the more oxidizing compositions inherited from some sedimentary rocks. Nearly pure hematite is present in some metamorphosed banded iron formations. In contrast, native nickel-iron is present in some serpentinites. ===Extraterrestrial rocks=== Within meteorites, the iron-w√ºstite redox buffer may be more appropriate for describing the oxygen fugacity of these extraterrestrial systems. == Redox effects and sulfur == Sulfide minerals such as pyrite (FeS2) and pyrrhotite (Fe1‚àíxS) occur in many ore deposits. Pyrite and its polymorph marcasite also are important in many coal deposits and shales. These sulfide minerals form in environments more reducing than that of the Earth's surface. When in contact with oxidizing surface waters, sulfides react: sulfate (SO42‚àí) forms, and the water becomes acidic and charged with a variety of elements, some potentially toxic. Consequences can be environmentally harmful, as discussed in the entry for acid mine drainage. Sulfur oxidation to sulfate or sulfur dioxide also is important in generating sulfur-rich volcanic eruptions, like those of Pinatubo in 1991 and El Chichon in 1982. These eruptions contributed unusually large quantities of sulfur dioxide to the Earth's atmosphere, with consequent effects on atmospheric quality and on climate. The magmas were unusually oxidizing, almost two log units more so than the NiNiO buffer. The calcium sulfate, anhydrite, was present as phenocrysts in the erupted tephra. In contrast, sulfides contain most of the sulfur in magmas more reducing than the FMQ buffer. == See also == * Ellingham diagram * Normative mineralogy == References == * Donald H.

Originally a subsidiary of UTV Software Communications launched on 26 September 2004, the channel was sold to Disney in 2006. ==History== UTV and Ronnie Screwvala formed United Home Entertainment with 51% and 49% ownership interests, respectively. The company was formed to launch an Indian kids channel. It hired TAG for channel packaging. Chief Operating Officer Purnendu Bose was hired and was expected to hire 100 employees for the channel. Rs 100 crore was the expected initial investment with expectations of break even in three years. In September 2004, Hungama TV started broadcasting as the first domestic kids channel in India. In March 2005, one of the UTV founders, Zarina Mehta became Humgama's head of programming. In early 2006, Mehta was promoted to chief operating officer of the channel. In July 2006, Disney India acquired a controlling stake in Hungama TV from UTV Software Communications while also taking a 14.9% share in UTV. In 2006, Disney acquired Hungama TV from UTV. The channel started with both live-action and animated programming but, following the success of Doraemon, gradually shifted its focus to solely animated programming. In 2013, Hungama started adding original Indian series as a part of a localisation strategy. ==Programming Controversy == A Hindi dub of the Shin Chan anime started airing on Hungama TV on 19 June 2006, and it gained up to 60% of the channel's market share. There were complaints from parents over the main character's behaviour and the attitudes exhibited towards elders on the show, both of which were seen as a negative influence on children. The show was banned from Indian television in 2008 but soon after it started airing again on Hungama TV. ==References== Category:Television stations in Mumbai Category:Children's television channels in India Category:Disney television networks Category:Indian animation Category:Television channels and stations established in 2004 Category:2004 establishments in India Category:Disney India Media Networks Category:Anime television ","title":"Hungama TV"},{"id":"7451927","text":"Dead in the Water may refer to: * Dead in the Water (novel), the third book in the Stone Barrington series by Stuart Woods * Dead in the Water, a novel by Ann Granger * Dead in the Water (film), a 2002 American thriller * Dead in the Water (1991 film), a 1991 made-for-TV film starring Bryan Brown and Teri Hatcher * \\"Dead in the Water\\" (Supernatural), an episode of the television series Supernatural * \\"Dead in the Water\\", a song by David Gray from his 2002 album A New Day at Midnight * \\"Dead in the Water\\" (Midsomer Murders episode), an episode of the British television show Midsomer Murders * \\"Dead In the Water\\", a song by Hawthorne Heights from their album If Only You Were Lonely * \\"Dead In the Water\\", a song by Ellie Goulding from her album Halcyon * \\"Dead in the Water\\", a song by 10 Years from Feeding the Wolves * Dead in the Water (video game) ","title":"Dead in the Water"},{"id":"7451935","text":"Chinatown, Singapore.

Lake might be best known for the \\"Breakout\\" sequence of novels, set in a future in which humanity's wars have destroyed Earth and the survivors leave the Solar System in an attempt to find new homeworlds in other stellar systems. The novels follow several groups of colonists on these new worlds. In two, The Gods of Xuma and Warlords of Xuma, the new world is reminiscent of Edgar Rice Burroughs's fictional version of Mars; the books take a critical stance on his Barsoom novels. His most known work outside of that sequence is The Man who Loved Morlocks from 1981, a kind of sequel to The Time Machine. He was essentially inactive in the genre since 1989 with the exception of one award-winning short story. That story, \\"The Truth About Weena\\", also involved the Time Machine.

She began her stage career at the age of 10 appearing in child roles in Shakespeare plays performed at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London. After two years, she continued with her education, graduating with a degree in music from Trinity College, London. Grey then sang professionally in a choir while continuing to study singing. After initially performing a number of small roles at the Vaudeville Theatre, Grey moved to the Gaiety Theatre. The Gaiety presented musical burlesques that employed dancers, and so Grey studied dance with John D'Auban, among others, before debuting as a dancer in 1884. In 1885, she danced the role of Polly Flamborough in The Vicar of Wide-awake- field at the Gaiety and soon rose to become the principal dancer there. In addition to dancing, she often played comedy roles. Grey became known for her performances in Gaiety burlesques such as Monte Cristo Jr. and Little Jack Sheppard (1886), Miss Esmeralda (1887) and Ruy Blas and the Blas√© Rou√© (1889 in London and then Australia). In 1891, she played one of the stepsisters in the Gaiety's Cinder Ellen up-too-Late after which the company, including Grey, toured the piece in Australia. She played Flo Fanshawe at the Prince of Wales's Theatre in In Town.St. Johnston, Reginald. A History of Dancing (1906), London: Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co. In 1893, she played Donna Julia in Don Juan at the Gaiety (by Meyer Lutz, A. C. Torr and Adrian Ross). The Dramatic Peerage commented, \\"The poetry of motion has no more charming exponent than Miss Sylvia Grey\\".Reid, Erskine and Herbert Compton. The Dramatic Peerage, Raithby, Lawrence & Co Ltd, London, 1892, pp. 95‚Äì96 In addition to appearing on stage, Grey also taught dance to actors and to wealthy clients, some of whom were drawn from the aristocracy. This provided her with a greater income than that she received from performing at the Gaiety. Among her many prominent students was Ellen Terry. Grey married in 1893, and her last West End performance was as the Countess Acacia in Baron Golosh in 1895 at the Trafalgar Theatre. During World War I, she ran an Australian Officer's Club in London. She made several French films in the 1920s, including Le Secret de Rosette Lambert (1920), La Maison du myst√®re (1923, as Marjorie) and Comment j'ai tu√© mon enfant (1925). ==NotesReferences== *Hindson, Catherine.

He was subject of multimillion-pound bids from Arsenal, West Ham, Aston Villa,Liverpool and Everton and was widely considered to have the best left foot outside the Premier League. Smith joined Hartlepool United on a free transfer in November 2001. He quickly settled in as a first team regular, topping the Division's assists charts (with 37) as Hartlepool reached the Division Three play-offs. He rejoined former Hartlepool manager Chris Turner as he moved to Sheffield Wednesday when his Hartlepool contract expired at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season, after helping the club to promotion. He scored a goal on his second substitute appearance and a 20-yard volley on his full debut, but the knee injury which deprived him of the chance to face off against his former team in the play-off final, forced his retirement from professional football. He was released shortly after Wednesday won promotion to the Football League Championship.

He graduated from West Surrey College of Art and took an apprenticeship at Wenford Bridge Pottery. Biography at Widewalls art distributors He first studied with Henry Hammond and later with Michael Cardew at Wenford Bridge Pottery from 1980 to 1982.NewArtCentre. Rupert Spira ==Career== Medium size open poem bowl (43cm x 38cm x 12 cm) Medium white glaze bowl (35cm x 26cm x 14cm) Spira's early wheel-based pottery work reflected these early influences being in a very traditional Bernard Leach utilitarian style. This work is mostly practical in nature, taking the form of teapots, vases, vessels, plates and other culinary ware. In 1996, he set up his own pottery at Church Farm in Shropshire where his style changed from a functional to a more minimalist, finer, more complex style ranging in size from miniature to large-scale. While he continues to make and sell functional pottery he is now known for this more recent studio pottery. His best and most recognizable work contains poems, both self-written and by Kathleen Raine the celebrated British poet. The poems are either scratched into the glaze in the sgraffito style or written as embossed letters either in a square block or in a single line across the surface of the vessel.Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts - Exhibitions - Archive These works vary in size from small prayer bowls only a few centimetres across through to huge, open bowls 50cm or more in diameter. He is also known for his cylinders which are often made as part of a series and while each stands alone, are meant to be exhibited as a group. These also vary in scale from a few centimetres high through to the largest being a meter or more tall. He works in a limited palette, mainly simple white, off-white and black monochromes but he does also occasionally make deep, red-glazed bowls and bright yellow tea sets. His work appears in many galleries throughout Britain including the Victoria and Albert Museum and Sainsbury collection as well as in many private collections worldwide. == Spiritual teaching== Spira is also a spiritual teacher and writer in the branch of nonduality, (Advaita in Sanskrit), exploring the nature of experience in his essays and texts. He has published several books (see below), and a few DVDs with interviews. He holds regular meetings and retreats in the UK, Europe and the US. He continually works to investigate the nature of mind and reality through his philosophy and pottery. The pottery is the result of the artist's wish to make elegant pieces, in harmony with nature and human awareness. ==Other media== One of his talks about nonduality is included in the video game The Witness. ==Personal life== Spira is married to Ellen Emmet, a therapist and yoga instructor in the non- dual tradition of Kashmir Shaivism. He has a son Matthew. Spira lives and works in Oxford, U.K, and travels internationally to teach non-duality. ==Selected public collections== *Victoria and Albert museum *Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts ==Books== * The Transparency of Things, Non-Duality Press, 2008 * Presence: The Art of Peace and Happiness, Non-Duality Press, 2011 * Presence: The Intimacy of all Experience, Non-Duality Press, 2011 * The Ashes of Love, Sahaja Publications, 2016 * The Nature of Consciousness, Sahaja Publications, 2017 * Being Aware of Being Aware, Sahaja Publications, 2017 == References * Rupert Spira's website * Rupert Spira's non-duality website Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:English potters Category:Neo-Advaita teachers ","title":"Rupert Spira"},{"id":"7452029","text":"The Panoz DP01 is an open-wheel car that was produced by √âlan Motorsport Technologies at Braselton, Georgia, United States. It was developed for use in the 2007 Champ Car World Series season, replacing the aging de facto-spec Lola chassis. The DP01 was introduced to the world at the 2006 Grand Prix of San Jose on July 28, 2006. Due to the February 2008 sale of Champ Car to the Indy Racing League, which uses its own spec equipment, the car is not currently used in a professional racing series in the United States. The final race for the car was the 2008 Grand Prix of Long Beach. ==Development concepts== The DP01 in the hands of S√©bastien Bourdais. The Panoz DP01 was developed to be safer, and less aero-dependent while racing closely with other cars than previously existing Champ Cars. The Panoz had numerous changes from the previous Lola car, including more downforce from the underbody. Approximately 60% of the car's of downforce at came from the bottom of the car. This was done by directing the air in a way so as to create additional downforce on the car, thereby effectively sucking it to the racetrack. This put less dependency on the front and rear wings in the event of a failure at high speed. Another major change from the previous car was the raised nose, which was moved farther above the front wing and directing more air to the underbody aerodynamics. The raised nose also created a safer environment for the driver in the event of a head-on collision with a wall or another car. The driver sat more upright than in the Lola chassis, to reduce the chances of back injuries, and to better accommodate the use of the HANS device. Champ Car used the 2.65L 90¬∞ 8-cylinder turbocharged Cosworth XFE as the exclusive engine during the 2007 season. ==Unveiling== The DP01 was officially unveiled to the public at the Champ Car Grand Prix of Road America on September 24, 2006. Brazilian Roberto Moreno piloted the DP01 at the unveiling, putting down a few demonstration laps shortly before the feature Champ Car race that day.

The second open test occurred February 12 and 13 at MSR Houston. The third and last open test before the season took place March 9 and 10 at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca. The Panoz DP01's race debut was at the Vegas Grand Prix on April 8, 2007. Team Australia's Will Power won the inaugural pole and the first race with the DP01. ==Final Champ Car DP01 race== In February 2008, the sale of Champ Car to the Indy Racing League (IRL) was consummated. Since the IRL used its own spec formula based around a chassis made by Italian manufacturer Dallara, the DP01 was retired from championship racing after approximately one year of racing service. The 2008 Grand Prix of Long Beach held in April 2008 served as a \\"Champ Car finale\\", and the DP01s were used by all participants. ==Current status== Pre-paint carbon fiber curves of the DP01 at 2007 MSR Houston open test. The Panoz DP01 is no longer being manufactured. However, Elan Motorsports Technologies did use the car as somewhat of a model for the Panoz DP09 chassis for the Superleague Formula series that houses a naturally aspirated Menard 4.2 V12 engine. DP01s owned by most Champ Car teams were sold to privateers in the United States and elsewhere. Two examples of the cars in use during 2010 were in the BOSS GP Series, where the chassis was campaigned by Henk de Boer and by Peter Milavec. Atlantic Championship former president Ben Johnston also owned multiple DP01s, which he intended to be raced in a new multi-class open wheel racing series called GreenPrixUSA. However, the series was delayed due to track and possible engine issues. As of 2016, Johnston was forced to liquidate his racing assets due to divorce. ==Complete IndyCar Series results== (key) {  style=\\"text-align:center; font- size:85%\\" ! Year ! Entrants ! Engines !

C. Torr and Herbert F. Clark with music by Meyer Lutz. It is based on the Victor Hugo drama Ruy Blas. The piece was produced by George Edwardes. As with many of the Gaiety burlesques, the title is a pun. After a tryout in Birmingham beginning on 3 September 1889, Ruy Blas and the Blas√© Rou√© opened in London on 21 September 1889 at the Gaiety Theatre and ran for 289 performances. The cast included Nellie Farren, Fred Leslie, Marion Hood, Letty Lind, Sylvia Grey, Linda Verner,Verner is probably best remembered today as the original First Bridesmaid in Trial by Jury (1875) by Gilbert and Sullivan. Blanche Massie, Alice Young, Charles Danby, Fred Storey and Ben Nathan.Hollingshead, p. 57 The piece toured in the British provinces and internationally, and was revised at least once during its run. It originally included a caricature of Henry Irving, in a scene in which some of the actors wore ballet girl costumes. Irving, never having seen the show, objected, and the Lord Chamberlain (Britain's theatrical censor, who also had not seen the show) prohibited the caricature.Hollingshead, pp. 57‚Äì58 ==Background== This type of burlesque, or \\"travesty\\", was popular in Britain during the Victorian era. Other examples include The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole (1877), Blue Beard (1882), Ariel (1883, by F. C. Burnand), Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed (1883), Little Jack Sheppard (1885), Monte Cristo Jr. (1886), Miss Esmeralda (1887), Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim (1887), Mazeppa, Faust up to Date (1888), Carmen up to Data (1890), Cinder Ellen up too Late (1891) and Don Juan (1892, with lyrics by Adrian Ross).Programme for Carmen up to Data Fred Leslie, Marion Hood and Nellie Farren in the Birmingham premiere John Hollingshead had managed the Gaiety Theatre from 1868 to 1886 as a venue for variety, continental operetta, light comedy, and numerous musical burlesques composed or arranged by the theatre's music director, Wilhelm Meyer Lutz. Hollingshead called himself a \\"licensed dealer in legs, short skirts, French adaptations, Shakespeare, taste and musical glasses.\\"Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (on Gaiety) Cuttings accessed 1 March 2007 In 1886, Hollingshead ceded the management of the theatre to George Edwardes, whom he had hired in 1885. Edwardes expanded the burlesque format from one act to full-length pieces with original music by Lutz, instead of scores compiled from popular tunes, as was the usual course before that. The theatre's choreographer and dance-master, under both Hollingshead and Edwardes, was John D'Auban.\\"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies\\", The Times, 20 February 1914, p. 9 Nellie Farren, as the theatre's \\"principal boy\\", starred at the Gaiety for over 20 years, from 1868. Between 1885 and 1891, she co-starred with Fred Leslie, who wrote many of the Gaiety's most popular burlesques under his pseudonym, \\"A. C. Torr\\".Stewart, Maurice. \\"The spark that lit the bonfire\\", Gilbert and Sullivan News (London) Spring 2003, London: The Gilbert and Sullivan Society. In the early 1890s, as burlesque went out of fashion, Edwardes changed the focus of the theatre from musical burlesque to the new genre of Edwardian musical comedy.Ganzl, Kurt. \\"Musicals\\", London: Carlton (1995), p. 56 ; Hyman, Alan. \\"The Gaiety Years\\", London: Cassell (1975), p. 64 Ruy Blas was written to mark the reopening of the Gaiety theatre and the return to the West End of the hugely popular Gaiety company, led by Farren and Leslie, who had been on tour in the U.S. and Australia. The early scenes of the libretto make many allusions to this return.\\"Ruy Blas and the Blas√© Rou√©\\", The Era, 7 September 1889, p. 8 In his review, the critic Clement Scott remarked not only on the new piece but on the redecoration of the theatre, which he found \\"deserving of the highest praise\\".\\"Ruy Blas and the Blas√© Rou√©\\", The Theatre, 1 October 1889, p. 212 The scenery and the costumes, as usual, were among the prominent attractions of a Gaiety show. Percy Anderson's costumes were particularly admired. The scene to which Henry Irving took exception was a comic dance, performed to Lutz's pas de quatre from Faust up to Date, in which Fred Leslie, Ben Nathan, Charles Danby and Fred Storey were made up to resemble Irving, Wilson Barrett, J. L. Toole and Edward Terry. In addition to impersonating the four actors, Leslie and his colleagues were wearing petticoats, imitating the female stars who danced to the same tune in the earlier work. Reviewing the Birmingham premiere, The Era hinted broadly that this scene was vulgar and should be dropped, and the paper regretted in its review of the London first night that its hint had not been taken.The Era, 14 September 1889, p. 10 ==Cast== Linda Verner in the premiere *Ruy Blas ‚Äì Nellie Farren *Don Caesar de Bazan ‚Äì Fred Leslie *Queen of Spain ‚Äì Marion Hood *Donna Elto ‚Äì Letty Lind *Donna Christina ‚Äì Sylvia Grey *Duchess Agio Uncertanti ‚Äì Linda Verner *Tarara, a trumpeter ‚Äì Blanche Massey (miscredited as Blanche Massie) *An officer ‚Äì Alice Young *Don Salluste ‚Äì Charles Danby (later replaced by Dalton Sommers) *Major Domo ‚Äì Ben Nathan *Court Physician ‚Äì Fred Storey *Cerayonez ‚Äì William Benson Servants, Pages, Lords, Ladies, Algauzils, Nobles, Musicians, &c.;, &c.; ==Musical numbers== Programme for the Gaiety production ;Act I *Chorus, \\"Bolero\\" *Song, \\"The Villain\\" ‚Äì Don Salluste *Chorus, \\"Hail to our Queen\\" *Song, \\"The Song of my Heart\\" ‚Äì Queen of Spain *Chorus, \\"Private Theatricals\\" *Trio, \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" ‚Äì Ruy Blas, Don Caesar and Don Salluste *Pas seul, \\"Danse espagnole\\" ‚Äì Donna Christina *Eccentric dance ‚Äì Court Physician *Duet and pas de deux, \\"Ma's Advice\\" ‚Äì Ruy Blas and Don Caesar *Finale, \\"We're discovered\\" ;Act II *Song and duet, \\"The Whistling Lullaby\\" ‚Äì Don Caesar and Ruy Blas *Song, \\"The Flower Song\\" ‚Äì Queen of Spain *Chorus, \\"Good Night\\" *Song, \\"Stick to the Whisky you're used to ‚Äì Don Caesar *Duet, \\"I've just had a Wire\\" ‚Äì Ruy Blas and Don Caesar *Duet, \\"Johnny Jones and his Sister Sue\\" ‚Äì Donna Etto and Don Salluste *Letty Lind Waltz (composed by C.

Ruy Blas and Don Caesar are introduced to the royal palace in the capacity of strolling players. Don Salluste, a corrupt court official, has private reasons to wish to humiliate the Queen, and he persuades Ruy and Caesar to disguise themselves as women and apply for posts in the royal household. They are accepted, and Salluste then accuses the Queen of smuggling men into her private apartments, disguised as women. Ruy and Caesar are arrested and jailed. ;Act II ;Scene 1 ‚Äì Cells of misdemeanants of the first class Ruy and Caesar find that their imprisonment is extraordinarily luxurious, but despite its attractions they escape, with the connivance of the Queen. ;Scene 2 ‚Äì Interior of Don Salluste's house Ruy and Caesar attempt to burgle Don Salluste's safe and find that he has got himself locked inside it. They release him, but he is immediately arrested because in his safe are found some of the Queen's jewels, which he has stolen. ;Act III ‚Äì Palace gardens Ruy Blas wins the Queen's heart by various daring deeds, including bullfighting. He is proclaimed King, and Don Caesar is appointed to the post of Lord Chamberlain vacated by the disgraced Salluste. ==Critical reception== The critics generally viewed the libretto as a departure from the old traditions of burlesque, because its resemblance to the original work was tangential, and because Hugo's Ruy Blas was not well enough known in England to be a fruitful subject for parody. In The Theatre, Clement Scott wrote, \\"As to the play on which the burlesque is supposed to be founded, save in the first act, where it is fairly closely followed, we hear but little of it.\\" Moonshine magazine went so far as to call Ruy Blas \\"Probably the worst burlesque ever seen ‚Ä¶ for it does not give the faintest caricature of the original.\\"\\"Ruy Blas\\", Moonshine, 3 May 1890, p. 207 The theatrical newspaper The Era reported that, entertaining though the new piece was, it had little by way of a plot, commenting: \\"And now the travestie, in losing some of its old attributes ‚Äì a coherent plot, for instance, and other such details ‚Äì has annexed so much from comic opera, so much from extravaganza, and so much from the music halls, that it fills up the entire bill from dinner time till nearing midnight.\\" The performances, the music and the staging on the other hand, were consistently praised. ==NotesReferences== *Adams, William Davenport.

Meteorological colour states are determined by the relevant worst condition from the visibility and significant cloud height.

If visibility or cloud height measurements fall on a boundary (e.g. 5000 m visibility or 1500 ft cloud height) the colour state assumes the higher value in this case WHT. If an airfield runway is unusable for reasons other than clouds or low visibility (e.g. ice or other obstructions) then the word BLACK is written in full and placed immediately before the actual colour state (e.g. BLACKWHT).

(Though his middle initial is M., he should not be confused with the horror writer who publishes under the name Scott M. Baker.) Baker grew up in Wheaton, Illinois, once a stop on the Underground Railroad, but more recently a bastion of evangelical fundamentalism and political conservativism, resistance to which has been one of the dominant influences on his life and writing. After graduating from New College in Florida, co-owning a leather shop in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and then dropping out of the doctoral program at the UC Irvine, he spent a number of years as a hippy, camping near Tassajarra Zen Center in the Los Padres National Forest and passing much of the rest of his time in various bars. Forced to the realization that he was not having enough fun as a would-be hedonist to justify the lifestyle, he decided to become a full-time writer. On the way there he became what may be the only person to hold a Master of Arts degree in speculative fiction (Goddard College). After 20 years in Paris, where he worked as a publisher's reader for several French publishers and, less artistically, as a financial translator for French brokerage houses, he now lives in Pacific Grove, California. His first novel, Symbiote's Crown (l'Idiot-roi) received the French \\"Prix Apollo\\" award. This novel was science fiction. He won a World Fantasy Award for Best Short Fiction in 1985 for Still Life with Scorpion, and has been nominated for the award three other times. Baker was co-author of the screenplay for the French film LITAN, which won the \\"Prix de la Critique\\" (Critic's Prize) at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival in 1982, and has worked on a number of other French films. He wrote some of the websites for WHO KILLED EVAN CHANG?, the web tie-in for Steven Spielberg's film, AI (Warner Brothers, 2001). He has been a judge for the World Fantasy Award and the Philip K. Dick Award. Now in semi-retirement, he devotes most of his time to playing tennis, at which he is tenacious but not particularly gifted. ==BibliographyNovels=== *Symbiote's Crown (1978) [Prix Apollo Winner] *Nightchild (1979) *Dhampire (1982) *Drink the Fire from the Flames (1987) (Ashlu) *Firedance (1986) (Ashlu) *Webs (1989) *Ancestral Hungers (1996) ===Short Story Collections (in French only)=== *Nouvelle recette pour canard au sang (1983) *Fringales (1985) *Al√©as (1985) ===Short Stories (in English)=== *Flatsquid Thrills (1982) *The Path (1982) *The Lurking Duck (1983) [World Fantasy nominee] *Still Life with Scorpion (1984) [World Fantasy winner] *Sea Change (1986) [Locus Awards nominee] *Nesting Instinct (1987) [World Fantasy nominee] *The Sins of the Fathers (1988) *Varicose Worms (1989) [World Fantasy nominee, Locus Awards nominee] *Alimentary Tract (1990) *The Jamesburg Incubus (1990) *Virus Dreams (1993) *Prospero (1993) *Full Fathom Deep (1995) *Feral Frolics (2014) ===Anthologies (in French only)=== *Ombres port√©es (1990) ==References== *The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, page 82 ==External links== * *Bibliography and book covers at FantasticFiction *French bibliography and book covers at nooSFere *French bibliography, covers, and cover copy at librarie YS: litt√©ratures de l'imaginaire Category:1947 births Category:20th-century American novelists Category:20th-century American male writers Category:American fantasy writers Category:American horror writers Category:American male novelists Category:American science fiction writers Category:Living people Category:World Fantasy Award-winning writers Category:American male short story writers Category:20th-century American short story writers Category:People from Pacific Grove, California Category:Novelists from California ","title":"Scott Baker (writer)"},{"id":"7452060","text":"Formors may refer to: * the Fomorians, a semi-divine race who inhabited Ireland in ancient times * Formors (album), a 2005 album by the French Celtic black metal band Aes Dana ","title":"Formors"},{"id":"7452064","text":"Istv√°n Csom (Amsterdam, 1974) Istv√°n Csom (born June 2, 1940, S√°toralja√∫jhely, Hungary) is a Hungarian chess Grandmaster and International Arbiter.

He was never titular prime minister, but was largely considered a de facto prime minister and well regarded by his contemporaries. Xu Mian's grandfather Xu Zhangzong (ÂæêÈï∑ÂÆó) was an officer under Emperor Wu of Liu Song, and his father Xu Rong (ÂæêËûç) was a commandery governor. However, the Xu family was not rich. When he was young, Xu Mian became known for studiousness, and he was retained by Southern Qi's prime minister Wang Jian to serve as an assistant. Wang was impressed by Xu's abilities, and often stated that he had the capability to become prime minister. Around this time, Xu also befriended the army officer Xiao Yi (Ëï≠Êáø), who later became a general. In 502, Xiao Yi's brother Xiao Yan forced Emperor He of Southern Qi to yield the throne to him, establishing Liang as its Emperor Wu. Having known Xu from the time when Xu and Xiao Yi were friends, Emperor Wu made him a mid-level official. After the prime minister Fan Yun died in 503, Emperor Wu entrusted the important matters of state to Xu and Zhou She, effectively making them co- prime ministers, even though neither carried the title and neither received particularly high rank. As de facto prime minister, Xu was considered to be capable, diligent, and honest. He often spent nights at his office, rather than his house‚Äîso much so that when he went home, his dogs would not recognize him and would bark at him. During his service, Xu also authored works designed to reestablish the formality of funeral mournings. He did not care for storing wealth, and whenever he had possessions, he would give them to the poorer members of his clan. In 524, Xu Mian's second son Xu Fei (ÂæêÊÇ±) died, and Xu Mian was so distressed that he tried to resign his post, but Emperor Wu would not let him. Also in 524, Zhou She died, and thereafter Xu handled prime minister duties alone. By 531, however, his resignation on account of illness appeared to have been accepted, as his posts from that point on appeared honorary. He died in 535, and both Emperor Wu and his crown prince Xiao Gang personally mourned Xu. Xu was awarded the posthumous name \\"Duke Jiansu,\\" even though there is no record that Emperor Wu ever created him a duke while he was alive or posthumously. == References == * Book of Liang, vol. 25 . * History of Southern Dynasties, vol. 60 . * Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 145.

He is perhaps best known for the Bubba Pritchert series, which have won two Analytical Laboratory readers' awards from Analog Science Fiction and Fact magazine. Farewell Blues was featured on the cover of the January/February 2015 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. Webster is also known for his survey of Groff Conklin's contribution to science fiction in 41 Above the Rest: An Index and Checklist for the Anthologies of Groff Conklin. Webster was a contributing editor and columnist for the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America Bulletin and published a collection of those columns titled Anthropology 101: Reflections, Inspections and Dissections of SF Anthologies through Merry Blacksmith Press. His Bulletin column, \\"Anthropology 101\\", examines the history of science fiction and fantasy through classic anthologies and anthologists, frequently pairing books by different editors but also presenting two or more books by the same anthologist. The column has included multi-installment pieces on Frederik Pohl, Robert Silverberg, Harry Harrison and more recently, Terry Carr. In addition, he has co-wrote three Bulletin articles with Dr. Jerry Pournelle. He was also a frequent contributor to the \\"Curiosity\\" page of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. He was the poetry editor and columnist for Helix SF, an online speculative fiction quarterly. After Helix SF ceased publication, he took his column, \\"Past Masters\\", to Jim Baen's Universe, and when that closed, to Eric Flint's Grantville Gazette. The \\"Past Masters\\" columns are retrospective appraisals of so-called \\"classic\\" science fiction and fantasy authors, and include extensive bibliographies. Some of the authors covered in the \\"Past Masters\\" series include Zenna Henderson, Fredric Brown, Edgar Pangborn, and Murray Leinster. Webster was poetry editor at Black Gate, a print fantasy magazine, for which he also wrote a column about little-known authors titled \\"Who?!\\" The only one of the columns appeared in Black Gate 15 and discussed author Tom Reamy. In 2007, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) appointed Webster Estates Liaison, placing him in charge of their Estates Project, which makes it possible for publishers to contact the agents or individuals who represent the literary estates of deceased science-fiction and fantasy writers so that material by those authors can be reprinted. The Estates database currently contains information on more than 450 sf/fantasy authors. In March 2012, SFWA announced that Webster would be given their Service to SFWA Award at the Nebula Awards banquet in May for his work on the SFWA Estates Project. In June 2013, Merry Blacksmith Press published a collection of Webster's essays about science fiction and fantasy authors and books titled Past Masters and Other Bookish Natterings, including articles on Clifford D. Simak. R. A. Lafferty, Judith Merril and others. This volume also includes short-short essays originally published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction as part of their \\"Curiosities\\" column, as well as three articles co-written with Jerry Pournelle. Webster was also a collector of science fiction books, and is the author of The Joy of Booking: Webster's Guide to Buying and Selling Used SF and Fantasy Books. ==Personal life== Webster was born in Roanoke, Virginia to Edna Urquhart Webster and Clarence H. Webster. He attended Crystal Spring Elementary, Woodrow Wilson Junior High and Patrick Henry high schools. In 1970 he graduated from Hermitage High School in Richmond. He studied music at Virginia Commonwealth University, majoring in composition. He was active in the Richmond music scene in the 1970s and 1980s performing in several bands, writing music reviews for various free newspapers, working as disc jockey on local radio, and managing a used record store. He also produced the CD Not Necessarily Serious of original folk-rock music by Richmond musician- songwriter Christie Oglesby in 2000. Raised a Baptist, he subsequently devolved into an antagonistic. At the time of his death, he was living in Richmond, Virginia, with his long-time companion, Mary Horton; whom he married May 26, 2013. ==BibliographyShort fiction=== ;StoriesShort stories unless otherwise noted. {class=' sortable' width='90%' - !width=25%Title !Year !First published !Reprinted/collected !Notes - Bringing it all back home 2007   Bubba Pritchert series - Bubba Pritchert and the space aliens 1994   Bubba Pritchert series - The three labors of Bubba 1996   Bubba Pritchert series - } ===Critical studies and reviews of Webster's work=== * ===Interviews=== * ==References * *Book Think: Interview with Bud Webster about 41 Above the Rest: An Index and Checklist for the Anthologies of Groff Conklin *Book Think: \\"A Bibliographer's Job Is Never Done\\" by Bud Webster * SFWA Bulletin * Original \\"Past Masters\\" columns from Helix SF and Jim Baen's Universe now at Galactic Central * Anthropology 101: Reflections, Inspections and Dissections of SF Anthologies from Merry Blacksmith Press. *SFWA Estate Project at SFWA.org *Official Announcement of the 2012 Service to SFWA Award *Past Masters and Other Bookish Natterings from Merry Blacksmith Press Category:1952 births Category:2016 deaths Category:American essayists Category:American male essayists Category:American male novelists Category:American male short story writers Category:American science fiction writers Category:American short story writers Category:Analog Science Fiction and Fact people Category:Virginia Commonwealth University alumni Category:Writers from Richmond, Virginia Category:Writers from Roanoke, Virginia Category:Novelists from Virginia ","title":"Bud Webster"},{"id":"7452083","text":"This is a chronological list of presidents of the Constitutional Court of Turkey since the establishment of the institution in 1962. {   - ! !

Founded in 1787, it is Scotland's oldest club. The club occupied premises on St Andrew Square from 1809 until 1837, when it moved to purpose-built rooms on Princes Street. The 1837 building was replaced with a modern building to a design by Reiach and Hall, which is protected as a category A listed building. Women were admitted in 1970, and offered full membership from 2010. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh has been the Patron of the Club since 1952. The only stated requirements for membership are that a candidate is over 18 and is \\"clubbable\\". ==History== The New Club was founded on 1 February 1787, only three weeks after the idea had been conceived at a Caledonian Hunt Ball held at the New Assembly Rooms in George Street. The Club was originally located in Bayle‚Äôs Tavern on Shakespeare Square, at the east end of Princes Street, which was demolished in the early 1800s. After the death of Jean Bayle in 1802, some thought was given to taking over the tavern, but the purchase of a property in St Andrew Square was the preferred course of action. Having abandoned the tavern in Shakespeare Square, the Club was now obliged to find temporary quarters in Fortune‚Äôs Tontine Tavern at 5 Princes Street before finding a new home, in August 1809, at 3 St Andrew Square.McCrae (2004) The original New Club building on Princes Street, designed by David Bryce Subsequently, numbers 84 and 85 Princes Street were purchased, redesigned and rebuilt, to a design by William Burn, as a clubhouse into which the Club moved on 15 May 1837. It was the first new building in Princes Street requiring the demolition of the original houses of the James Craig designed New Town.A Memoir by Sir James Dunbar-Nasmith, in McCrae (2004), pp.149ff. It was enlarged in 1859 to a design by David Bryce. Over the years various changes were made to the internal design of the Club, perhaps the major one being the reconstruction of the Coffee Room, or Dining Room, in 1908‚Äì1912. It had been decided to increase its size and improve the lighting. Sir Robert Lorimer drew up a scheme to extend the Room by , with new windows being inserted and the walls adorned by oak panelling with inset portraits. In 1953 the New and University Clubs amalgamated. Whilst extensive alterations and redecoration were carried out, there remained unresolved the intention to create a ladies‚Äô annexe. The Club was completely rebuilt in the 1960s to a modern design by Alan Reiach, Eric Hall and Partners, incorporating the recommendations of the Princes Street Panel which included the aspiration for a continuous first-floor walkway along Princes Street. The new building introduced a Ladies‚Äô \\"Side\\" with a Ladies' Bar, Ladies‚Äô Drawing Room and Ladies‚Äô Dining Room. The cost of demolition and re-build was paid for by an insurance company who gained 125 year leases on the three shops below the Club's main floors. The Club negotiated a lease of the St Andrew‚Äôs Hotel as a temporary clubhouse whilst the Princes Street building was demolished and rebuilt. On re-building, the Club re-constructed the original Lorimer panelling within the new Dining Room. The new clubhouse opened for lunch on Monday 15 December 1969. Ladies were first admitted as Associate Members to the Club on 25 March 1970 (Lady Day). Only wives of Members could be elected until October 2010, when ladies were permitted full membership and their husbands could join as Associate Members. ==The New Club building== Numbers 84‚Äì87 Princes Street, incorporating the New Club, were listed by Historic Scotland on 18 March 1996 as a category A listed building. Category A includes buildings which are of national or international architectural significance. Historic Scotland describe the New Club premises as the finest example of a Princes Street Panel building. The Princes Street fa√ßade, faced with plate glass and Rubislaw granite and with distinctive cantilevered sections, is described euphemistically as \\"very carefully composed\\". The building is one of around 60 post-Second World War listed buildings in Edinburgh. ==See also== *DoCoMoMo Key Scottish Monuments *List of Category A listed buildings in the New Town, Edinburgh *List of post-war Category A listed buildings in Scotland *Prospect 100 best modern Scottish buildings ==References== * ==External links== *Official website Category:1787 establishments in Scotland Category:Clubs and societies in Edinburgh Category:Organisations based in Edinburgh Category:New Town, Edinburgh Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1969 Category:Category A listed buildings in Edinburgh Category:Organizations established in 1787 Category:Listed clubhouses in the United Kingdom ","title":"New Club, Edinburgh"},{"id":"7452100","text":"Family Troubles is a one-reel comedy short subject and is an episode of the Our Gang series. It was released to theatres on April 3, 1943, produced and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. It was the 212th Our Gang short (213th episode, 124th talking short, 125th talking episode, and 44th MGM produced episode) that was released. ==Plot== Janet feels that her parents don't love her anymore because they made her older sister the definite center of attention during her aunt's visit. Filled with anger and despair, she decides to run away. The gang volunteers to look for a family or couple who will \\"adapt\\" Janet. After naming off potential candidates, they decide on the elderly Mr. and Mrs. Tom and Mary Jones and escort Janet to their home. A neighbor boy, who witnessed them, runs over to the Burstons' house with a report that Janet was kidnapped by a gang whose leader has a heavy voice (referring to Froggy). Mary and Jasper quickly call the police. When the gang pay the Jones a visit and offer Janet to them, the Jones quickly realize that Janet is a runaway and decide to teach her and the gang a lesson. They agree to adopt her but make her life a living hell by forcing her to scrub the kitchen floor (which causes Janet to wail, \\"Why did I ever leave home?\\") and show where she will sleep (which is under the kitchen table). When Mrs. Jones decides that Janet is unhappy enough, she walks out of the kitchen to phone Janet's parents, believing that Janet will happily run to them with open arms. But once Mrs. Jones leaves, Janet (with the help of the gang) runs away again. The gang soon discover that the police are searching for them, so they run and hide in a cave. While trying to cook some food, they burn it and create heavy smoke, which leaves their faces covered with soot and ashes. Once they see that the smoke will hide their true identities, they bring Janet back home and tell Janet's parents why she wanted to run away. Janet's family now realize how fortunate they are to have her. Mary apologizes for her unfeeling behavior and assures that it will never happen again. With everything happy, Froggy says, \\"All's well that ends well, I always say.\\" Jasper corrects him, saying that the phrase was originally made by Shakespeare. \\"He did?

In OIF 2004; it was designated as \\"Camp Ferrin-Huggins\\". , the base housed up to 5,000 troops. ==History== In September 2003, the construction of FOB Falcon (Camp Al-Saqr) in Iraq was a major engineering project for the 439th Engineer Battalion. The battalion transported more than 100,000 tons of gravel for constructing roads, and took part in construction of the base's structures. Because FOB Falcon was considered by Iraqi officials to be outside of Baghdad proper, it was not affected by the planned withdrawal of American combat troops from Iraqi cities by June 30, 2009. It was not uncommon for bases like FOB Falcon to be mortared by insurgents who used the surrounding neighborhoods as cover, risking the lives of Iraq civilians and those who lived on the FOB while they served. Small arms fire and the use of RPGs (Rocket Propelled Grenades) were also common and more prevalent during the early years of the deployments. ===10 October 2006 attack=== Members of a U.S. Air Force explosive ordnance disposal team unpack C-4 explosives, Oct. 16, 2006. The explosives will be used to detonate a cache of unexploded ordnance recovered from a blast area on Forward Operating Base Falcon, Iraq, following a recent mortar attack. The airmen are assigned to the 447th Expeditionary Civil Engineering Squadron. On October 10, 2006, at about 10:40 p.m. (1940 GMT), a major explosion rocked the base, reportedly due to the base's ammunition dump being hit by an 82mm mortar round fired by Iraqi insurgents. Further explosions continued for hours. Images of the explosions were carried live on CNN. There were no casualties. According to the official Department of Defense report released by US Central Command, the base resumed normal duties within 24 hours. Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq claimed responsibility for the attack. ===Operation New Dawn=== During Operation New Dawn, JSS Falcon was manned by 2nd Advise and Assist Brigade, 1st Infantry Division out of Fort Riley, Kansas. The base was transferred to the Iraqi Federal Police by 5th Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment in late July 2011. 5th of the 4th Cavalry had been advising both 2nd and 4th Iraqi Federal Police Divisions. The buildings and the land were turned over to 2nd Iraqi Federal Police Division to be used as a base of operations in the Rasheed district of Baghdad. Before the move, the 2nd IFP Div. was already operationally responsible for the area surrounding JSS Falcon, making the transition relatively seamless. ==See also== * List of United States Military installations in Iraq ==References== Category:Iraq War Category:Iraqi insurgency (2003‚Äì2011) Category:Installations of the United States Army in Iraq Category:Explosions in Iraq Category:Explosions in 2006 ","title":"Joint Security Station Falcon"},{"id":"7452114","text":"Mayerling is an episode of the American television series Producers' Showcase made for NBC Television, which was aired on 4 February 1957 and released theatrically as a film in Europe.IMDB entry The film was produced and directed by Anatole Litvak, who had previously directed the French film version of Mayerling (1936) which was an international hit and brought Litvak to Hollywood. The 1957 version stars Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer, Raymond Massey, Diana Wynyard, Basil Sydney, Judith Evelyn, Isobel Elsom, Lorne Greene, Nancy Marchand, David Opatoshu, Suzy Parker, Nehemiah Persoff, Pippa Scott, Monique van Vooren, and Lilia Skala. Raymond Massey, Diana Wynyard (seated), Judith Evelyn, Mel Ferrer, and Audrey Hepburn in Mayerling (TV episode of Producers' Showcase, 1957) ==Synopsis== The story of Mayerling is based on the historical Mayerling incident, the tragic love affair between Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria and his mistress, Baroness Mary Vetsera, and the mystery surrounding their apparent murder/suicide on January 30, 1889, at the imperial hunting lodge in Mayerling, Lower Austria. ==Production== Ferrer and Hepburn were reportedly in negotiation for two and a half years to make the special. It was done live, except for some background footage shot in Vienna. ==Reception== The New York Times wrote that \\"a more pallid or elementary version of Mayerling would be difficult to imagine.\\" \\"Hardly worth the trouble\\" said The Washington Post. ==Home media== Mayerling has recently been remastered and released to DVD in Region 1 for the first time ever. The primitive archival film copy has been digitally mastered from the original kinescope negative and released on \\"Mr. FAT-W Video\\" silver and blue label by Films Around the World. This hugely-expensive live television production was broadcast just once, on NBC, on February 24, 1957. The program was archivally preserved on kinescope which is a B&W; 16mm film taken from a studio monitor of the broadcast. Although the program cost more than $500,000 ‚Äî at a time when the per capita income of Americans was about $2,000 ‚Äî the kinescope budget was a paltry $1,500. Clearly, it was not thought that the production had a future beyond the single live network broadcast; only a few prints were made, which were loaned, not given, to a few people involved with the production. Kinescopes have such poor quality that for many years they were thought to be unusable for modern video and television. However, advances in digital technology have made it possible to master Mayerling from the original kinescope negative and print materials in high definition, which mysteriously brings out more details than could be seen with the naked eye watching the television broadcast. The master was then upgraded using the latest digital programming ‚Äî the grainy appearance was softened, blurred edges are put back in focus, brightness/darkness was adjusted, hand-editing replaced numerous frames with a flash of light with a duplicate frame preceding the bad frame, sound was upgraded to remove most static/pops/hisses, and so on. The finished HD master was then edited to make versions with and without commercials available, and then \\"stepped down\\" to standard definition for video; the four acts were digitally marked so that a \\"skip ahead\\" goes from act to act. Finally, permission for the video release was obtained from Sean Ferrer, Luca Dotti, and Mel Ferrer's widow. The film is now available on Region 2 DVD.Films Around the World entryIMDB entry ==See also== * Mayerling Incident * Mayerling (1968 feature film) ==ReferencesFilms Around the World entry Category:1957 films Category:1957 television films Category:1957 drama films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:American television films Category:Biographical films about Austrian royalty Category:Films set in 1889 Category:Films set in Vienna Category:Films set in Austria Category:Films directed by Anatole Litvak Category:Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria Category:Films set in the Austro-Hungarian Empire ","title":"Mayerling (1957 film)"},{"id":"7452120","text":"Richard Neil Barron (23 March 1934 - 5 September 2010) was a science fiction bibliographer and scholar.

C. Torr) and W. T. Vincent, with music arranged by Meyer Lutz from compositions by Lionel Monckton, Sidney Jones, Walter Slaughter, Osmond Carr, Scott Gatti, Jacobi, Robertson, and Leopold Wenzel. Additional lyrics were written by Basil Hood. The show was a burlesque of the well-known pantomime and fairy tale, Cinderella. The piece was first produced in Melbourne, Australia at the Princess's Theatre on 22 August 1891 and then in Sydney, on 5 October at the Theatre Royal. It then debuted in London at the Gaiety Theatre in London and ran from 24 December 1891 until 9 July 1892, a total of 181 performances. It was revised and revived later in 1892. The production was directed by Walter Raynham, with choreography by Katti Lanner and Willie Warde and costumes by Wilhelm. Nellie Farren created the title role in Australia; in London the part was played by Kate James and then Letty Lind. The piece was re-written during the run; some characters were dropped and new ones were introduced. The cast included Sylvia Grey as Linconzina and Florence Levey as Fettalana (the stepsisters), E. J. Lonnen as Prince Belgravia, Arthur Williams as Sir Ludgate Hill, and Fred Leslie as \\"a servant\\".

Hollingshead called himself a \\"licensed dealer in legs, short skirts, French adaptations, Shakespeare, taste and musical glasses.\\"Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (on Gaiety) Cuttings, accessed 1 Mar 2007 In 1886, Hollingshead ceded the management of the theatre to George Edwardes, whom he had hired in 1885. Edwardes expanded the burlesque format from mostly one-act to full-length pieces, generally with original music by Lutz instead of scores compiled from popular tunes.\\"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies\\", The Times, 20 February 1914, p. 9 Nellie Farren starred as the \\"principal boy\\" at the Gaiety for over 20 years.

Whilst some authorities list Nymphaea lotus f. thermalis as being synonymous with N. lotus, others list it as a distinct taxon ‚Äì further investigation is required to determine its precise classification. The usual habitat for Nymphaea lotus is the Nile Delta, hence Nymphaea lotus f. thermalis's Romanian habitat is unusual. == Description == Nymphaea lotus f. thermalis is a water lily which blooms at night ‚Äì its flowers last four days and have four sepals, 19‚Äì20 white petals along with yellow anthers and stamens. There is usually a 15‚Äì30 cm gap between flowers and the surface of the water, flowers are slightly fragrant; the round leaves of the plant are 20‚Äì50 cm wide. A description was first formally published in Math. Term√©szettud. √ârtes. 25(4):32, 36. 1907. == Habitat == Nymphaea lotus f. thermalis is endemic to the thermal water of the Pe≈£a River, S√¢nmartin, Bihor County, Romania. The area is protected as a nature reserve (51.0 hectares (126 acres) in size) and consists of a rivulet along with three ponds. The water has a roughly constant temperature of around 30 ¬∞C whilst the site has an average air temperature of 10‚Äì11 ¬∞C. The thermal waters have been recorded as early as 1211, but it was only in 1799 that the first record of N. lotus was made, by P√°l Kitaibel. Janos Tuzson proposed in 1907 that this population's unusual location could be explained by the persistent heat provided by the thermal springs could have sustained the population at a pre-ice age time when the plant would have been spreading across the warmer regions of Europe; this theory was corroborated by additional evidence provided by the identification of other endemic species. Alexandru Borza was the Government minister in charge of education (and also a botanist) who made the first push for legal protection and recognition of Nymphaea lotus f. thermalis ‚Äì in 1932, the Cabinet of Romania declared the rivulet a nature reserve and the plant a \\"national monument\\". Conservation action with the intent to preserve this population has been undertaken for many years (since at least 1940) ‚Äì including the management of invasive species ‚Äì and the plant has been included in recent water management legislation.

Educated at Bishop's Stortford College and Cambridge, he was an excellent athlete and horseman. He received his medical training at the London Hospital, Whitechapel, where he qualified as a physician in 1914. ==Career and work== During World War I, Dick-Read served with the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was badly wounded at Gallipoli but later served in France. When the war ended, he returned to the London Hospital for a year and then completed an MD at Cambridge. In the early 1920s, he worked at a clinic in Woking and it became very popular. Dick-Read specialised in childbirth and care, observing and writing up case histories and notes. He published his first book Natural Childbirth in 1933, coining the term \\"natural childbirth.\\" He defined the term as the absence of any intervention that would otherwise disturb the sequence of labor. The book argued that because of \\"civilized\\" British women fear birth, the birthrate was dropping, and if they were not to fear birth it would be easier since fear creates tension which, in turn, causes pain. Dick-Read's ideas were at first ridiculed, and he was expelled from the London clinic he had set up with a group of fellow obstetricians. When the Woking partnership was dissolved in 1934, Dick-Read set up a private clinic at 25 Harley Street. His second book, Revelation of Childbirth (which was later retitled Childbirth without Fear), was published in 1942, and aimed at a general readership. It became an international bestseller, and it is still in print. Dick-Read was invited to give lecture tours all over the world. He moved to South Africa in 1948. In 1953 he returned to England and continued to lecture and write. In 1956 the UK Natural Childbirth Association, now called the National Childbirth Trust, was founded by Prunella Briance. It became the foremost charity concerned with birth and early parenthood. Grantly Dick-Read was its first president. In 1957, a phonograph album featuring Dick-Read and entitled Natural Childbirth: A Documentary Record of the Birth of a Baby was released by Argo Records in the UK and Westminster Records in the US. It is still available as a CD from Pinter & Martin. He died on 11 June 1959 aged 69 in Wroxham, Norfolk, at a riverside home that previously had been owned by the UK ukulele entertainer George Formby. A memorial plaque on Dick-Read's former clinic at 25 Harley Street was unveiled on 11 June 1992.City of Westminster green plaques ==Criticism== Dick-Read has been criticized for being anti- feminist. In his book Motherhood in the Post-War World he wrote, \\"Woman fails when she ceases to desire the children for which she was primarily made. Her true emancipation lies in freedom to fulfill her biological purposes,\\" as well as stating that tribal women who died in childbirth did so \\"without any sadness...realizing if they were not competent to produce children for the spirits of their fathers and for the tribe, they had no place in the tribe.\\"\\"Who Said Childbirth Is Natural?: The Medical Mission of Grantly Dick Read\\", by Donald Caton, MD, in Anesthesiology 4 1996, Vol.84, 955-964 He also stated in 1942, \\"The mother is the factory, and by education and care she can be made more efficient in the art of motherhood.\\" He also claimed that \\"primitive\\" women did not experience childbirth pain, although he did not define \\"primitive\\" and never watched women in childbirth in \\"primitive\\" societies. Anthropological research has demonstrated this claim to be untrue. There is as much variety in the method and experience of giving birth in so- called ‚Äúprimitive cultures‚Äù as there are in Western cultures. ==See also== * Childbirth positions * Squatting position ==References== * Dick-Read, Grantly (2004), Childbirth without Fear: The Principles and Practice of Natural Childbirth, Pinter & Martin, * Noyes Thomas, A.

Number of permanent residents according to the census of the year 2000 is 381.

They are Sunni Muslims of the Hanafi denomination. 250 people had left their native land, fleeing from the war between the Russian and Ottoman Empires. Haci Mehmet Efendi from the neighboring village of Maden led them to the place called Hayriye where they finally were given by the Turkish authorities the right to settle after clashes with Chechen refugees, who themselves had fled from persecution in the Russian Empire. (Haci Effendi had chosen the area of Hayriye because it resembled the conditions of the Georgian area the settlers came from.) The village is still almost exclusively inhabited by the descendants of the original Georgian families. Since the 1960s, many inhabitants of Hayriye went as migrant workers to Germany (most live in and around Bergneustadt, North Rhine-Westphalia) and Austria.

He was a rider of immense promise and talent who had his career derailed by a personal struggle with drug abuse. Winning the final leg of the 1994 season at Philip Island, he became the youngest ever World Superbike race winner at the age of 19 years old, a record that was improved by 18-year-old Yuichi Takeda at Sugo in 1996. Gobert won that race at Phillip Island from Pole and is still (2018) the youngest rider (19 years, 7 months and 26 days) to do that. ==Superbikes/Supersport== In his teens he was a successful motocross racer, winning national classes in Australia, before moving to road racing and winning the Australian domestic superbike championship. He first earned international notice as a wild card at his home Superbike World Championship round at Philip Island in , taking pole position, a win and a third place. Racing full-time in the championship for Muzzy Kawasaki in , he became team leader after Scott Russell's abrupt departure and finished 4th overall, winning races at Laguna Seca and Philip Island.Anthony Gobert career World Superbike statistics at worldsbk.com He was 8th in , with 3 wins and 3 other podiums, after missing much of the season through injury. For 1998 and 1999 he competed in the AMA Superbike Championship on a Vance & Hines Ducati, with some success, including a win as a WSBK wildcard at Laguna Seca.An Interview with Anthony Gobert A win in the second race was within reach, until an unforced crash at the final turn, onto the main straight. The second race was won by his teammate Ben Bostrom. For he returned to WSBK on a Bimota SB8R. With the race number 501, he won a wet race at Philip Island and generally did better than expected on the machine, before the team folded, due to lack of financial backing. Bimota named the SB8K Gobert bike after him. Three British Superbike meetings (substituting for Steve Hislop at Team Virgin Mobile Yamaha) followed in late 2000. For 2001 he was back in the AMA championship with Yamaha, spending two years racing the YZF R7 in the superbike class and the YZF R6 in the supersport class respectively. This was followed with a brief dalliance with Ducati in 2003. After some time back in the Australian Superbike series he did two rounds of Supersport World Championship at the start of , replacing the injured David Checa.WSBK: Gobert returns to WSBK as Valencia wild-card In , he raced at the Valencia Superbike World Championship round (making him the first rider to have wildcard rides in three different countries), alongside some rounds of Spain's Superbike series. For 2007 he returned to Australia Superbikes on a Kawasaki. ==Grand Prix== He went to the 500cc World Championship in 1997 with the Lucky Strike Suzuki replacing Scott Russell as the number one rider, but was dismissed in mid-season after failing a drug test. A 500cc one-off at Donington Park for Kenny Roberts' KR3 Modenas Team followed in late 2000. ==Career resultsGrand Prix motorcycle racing=== Races by year (key) (Races in bold indicate pole position, races in italics indicate fastest lap) {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" !

He was granted bail on condition that he surrender his passport, report to police five times a week and not enter central Surfers Paradise. In June 2019 Gobert was reported to have been involved in an altercation at a restaurant. Afterwards he was followed home by number of individuals whom he'd earlier fought with. They forced their way into Gobert's home and beat him with batons. He was beaten so badly that doctors could not recognise him, and was also robbed; after he regained consciousness hospital staff were able to internet-search his background and contacted relatives.Anthony ‚ÄúGo-Show‚Äù Gobert Recovering In Hospital After Being Attacked And Beaten, Brother Aaron Gobert Says Roadracing World, 18 June 2019.

The first bombing raid on Naples was on 1 November 1940. A force of Bristol Blenheim light bombers of the Royal Air Force based on the island of Malta attacked in the hours before dawn, mainly targeting industries in the eastern part of the city (because of the presence of fuel reserves and refineries) and the area near the main railway station.

Emigrating to the UK at the age of 19, Lutz started as an organist and soon became a theatrical conductor in London. After serving from 1850 to 1855 as music director of the Surrey Theatre, Lutz conducted touring opera companies and composed some serious music and music for the Christy Minstrels. In 1869, he was engaged as the music director of the Gaiety Theatre, London, arranging and later composing a series of popular burlesques over the next 25 years. Lutz continued to compose songs into the 20th century. ==Life and career== Lutz was born in M√ºnnerstadt, Bavaria, Germany. His parents were Joseph Lutz (1801‚Äì1879), a music professor, and Magdalena (1809‚Äì1862). His older brother, Baron Johann Lutz, became the prime minister of Bavaria under King Ludwig II of Bavaria. Lutz studied music first with his father, then in W√ºrzburg at the University.G√§nzl, Kurt. \\"Lutz, (Wilhelm) Meyer (1829‚Äì1903)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, Retrieved on 8 July 2008 He visited Britain, as a pianist, in 1846, and then moved to England in 1848 at the age of 19.Scowcroft, Philip L. \\"A Twenty-Second Garland of British Light Music Composers\\", Music Web International, Retrieved on 8 July 2007 ===Early career=== Lutz in 1868 Lutz began as an organist in churches at Birmingham and Leeds.Obituary in The Times, 2 February 1903, p. 7 Then, for many years, he played the organ at St. George's Roman Catholic Cathedral.The Times, 18 August 1854, p. 6 Lutz was also a Freemason, and served as the Grand Organist of the United Grand Lodge of England.Obituary in The Musical Times, Vol. 44, No. 721, 1 March 1903, p. 177 Lutz soon became a theatrical conductor. From 1850 to 1855, he conducted at the Surrey Theatre and later the Royalty Theatre. For that theatre, he composed two operas, the one-act The Charmed Harp (1852) and a grand opera, Faust and Marguerite (1855).\\"Wilhelm Meyer Lutz\\", ItalianOpera.org After this, for many years, Lutz conducted concerts in the British provinces and touring opera troupes for Giulia Grisi, the tenor Mario and others.Musical Times, November 1859 Some of these were led by the tenor Elliot Galer (the founder, in 1877, of the Royal Opera House in Leicester),Adams, William Davenport. A Dictionary of the Drama, p. 558, Burt Franklin, 1904 who produced Lutz's opera Zaida, or, The Pearl of Granada (with a libretto by Oliver Summers) in 1859 in Liverpool.

Galer also mounted three other Lutz operas at the Royalty Theatre in London: Blonde or Brunette (1862), Cousin Kate (1863), and Felix, or The Festival of the Roses (1865). During these years, Lutz also composed the cantatas Herne the Hunter (The Crystal Palace, 1862) and King Christmas (Oxford Music Hall, 1863), and music for the Christy Minstrels. ===Gaiety Theatre years=== In 1869, manager John Hollingshead hired Lutz as the resident musical director and conductor at the recently opened Gaiety Theatre, composing dances and songs for productions at that theatre, as well as conducting the orchestra for the operas, operettas, plays and burlesques mounted at the theatre. In this capacity, he conducted Thespis, the first Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera, in 1871. Souvenir programme from Ruy Blas Lutz's early compositions for the Gaiety theatre included incidental music for Dreams (1869), a play by Thomas W. Robertson.Hollingshead (1898), p. 87 The Miller of Milburg (1872). At the same time, Christine Nilsson performed his scena Xenia the Sclavonian Maiden (1869), and at the Covent Garden Promenade Concerts in 1873, his cantata, Legend of the Lys, was performed. He also composed music for such shows as On Condition (1882) and Posterity (1884) for Lila Clay's all-ladies troupe. He also composed the popular song, \\"Eyes of English Blue\\" for Alice Atherton. At the Gaiety, Lutz compiled the scores, and later often composed original music, for a series of popular pasticcio entertainments, opera-bouffes and burlesques, including The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole (1877); Robbing Roy (1879 by F. C. Burnand); a version of The Forty Thieves (1880, libretto by Robert Reece; Lutz had conducted an 1878 version of the same story); All in the Downs; or, Black-Eyed Susan (1881); Aladdin (1881); Oh!

On 3 May 1886, the Gaiety Theatre hosted a selection of scenes played for Lutz's benefit, including scenes from Lutz's grand opera Faust and Marguerite, his burlesque Little Jack Sheppard and the operetta Karl and several recitations and solo pieces. The performers included Nellie Farren (who had sung under him in nearly all of his Gaiety pieces), Marion Hood, Durward Lely, Richard Temple and many others.Moss, Simon.

For the Opera Comique in 1895, Lutz composed A Model Trilby, or A Day or Two after du Maurier. He also wrote additional songs for Baron Golosh for the Trafalgar Theatre (1895).Adams, William Davenport. A dictionary of the drama, p. 113, Chatto & Windus, 1904. Lutz wrote a string quartet and ballads such as \\"Thy Silv'ry Tones\\", \\"Enchant Mine Ear\\" and \\"Sail on Silver Cloud.\\" In the last years of the 19th century, Lutz conducted a band playing Summer seasons at the spa in Scarborough. He continued to compose songs into the 20th century, including music for Hidenseek (1901) and a few numbers for Ivan Caryll and Cecil Cook's The Girl from Kays (1902). However, Lutz seems to have run low on funds, as another benefit was held for him on 28 November 1901 at the Gaiety Theatre, organised by George Edwardes.The Times, 25 October 1901, announcing the benefit. Lutz was married in 1856 to Elizabeth Cook (b. 1835) and later to her sister Emily Cook (b. 1847).Lamb, Andrew. \\"Comic Opera Goes Latin-American, 1890‚Äì92: Part 2\\" in The Gaiety, Winter 2006, p. 29 Their brothers were the bass Thomas Aynsley Cook (1833‚Äì1894) and the baritone John Furneaux Cook, and their sister, Alice Aynsley Cook (c. 1850‚Äì1938), was also an opera singer and musical comedy actress. His niece, Annie, married Eugene Goossens, Jr. Lutz also had a son, Caspar, who became a clergyman.The Times, 17 December 1908, p. 13 In printed works, such as scores and theatre programmes, Lutz was usually credited simply as Meyer Lutz. Some of Lutz's music was arranged for military band by J. A. Kappey.Kappey, J. A. Reminiscences of The Gaiety (Boosey's military Journal, 1891) ASIN: B0000CZ6RL. Lutz is mentioned in a P. G. Wodehouse novel, A Damsel in Distress (1919).Wodehouse, P. G. A Damsel in Distress, chapter 16 In addition, a character called Herr Toots in the 1912 novel Bella by Edward Booth is based on Lutz, as is the character Meyer Klootz in the 1940 novel Town and Haven by Oswald Harland, both novels being set in late Victorian Scarborough (named \\"Spathorpe\\" in Bella, and \\"Whitcliff\\" in Town and Haven). Lutz died of bronchitis at his home in Kensington, London at the age of 73. He was buried in St Mary's, Kensal Green. ==Selected works== Robert Reece and Lutz's The Forty Thieves, 1880 *The Charmed Harp (1852) (Surrey Theatre) *Faust and Marguerite (1855) (Surrey Theatre) *Blonde or Brunette (1862) (Royalty Theatre) *Felix, or The Festival of the Roses (1865) (Royalty Theatre) *Zaida, or, The Pearl of Granada (1868) (Liverpool) *The Miller of Milburg (1872) (Gaiety Theatre) *Legend of the Lys (1873) (cantata) *The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole (1877) (Gaiety Theatre) *Robbing Roy (1879) (Gaiety Theatre) *The Forty Thieves (1880) (Gaiety Theatre) *Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed (1883) (Gaiety Theatre) *Little Jack Sheppard (1885) (Gaiety Theatre) *Miss Esmeralda, or The Maid and the Monkey (1887) (Gaiety Theatre) *Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim (1887) (Gaiety Theatre) *Faust up to Date (1888) (Gaiety Theatre) *Ruy Blas and the Blas√© Rou√© (1889) (in Birmingham, then at the Gaiety) *Carmen up to Data (1890) (in Liverpool, then at the Gaiety) *Cinder Ellen up too Late (1893) (Gaiety Theatre) *A Model Trilby, or A Day or Two after du Maurier (1895) (Opera Comique) ==NotesReferences== *G√§nzl, Kurt.

The bombings launched on numerous British cities were known as the Blitz. The royal dockyards at HMNB Devonport were the main target in order to facilitate Nazi German efforts during the Battle of the Atlantic. Portsmouth, some 170 miles away in Hampshire, was also targeted by the Luftwaffe due to the presence of a royal dockyard there. Despite this, civilian casualties were very high and the dockyards continued in operation. The first bombs fell on the city on Saturday 6 July 1940 at Swilly, killing three people. In early 1941, five raids reduced much of the city to rubble. Attacks continued as late as May 1944 with two minor air raids in that month.\\"During the month of May 1944, there were eight air raid alerts and two minor air raids in this area.\\" ‚ÄòWar Diary, 5/1-31/44‚Äô Plymouth USNAAB, 15 June 1944, Fold3, [accessed 4 April 2012], p. 3.

In 1941 most of the children were evacuated and on any night that a raid was expected thousands of people were taken by lorry into the countryside, usually to the fringes of Dartmoor. In March 1941, St Andrew's Parish Church was bombed and badly damaged. Amidst the smoking ruins a headmistress nailed over the door a wooden sign saying simply Resurgam (Latin for I shall rise again), indicating the wartime spirit, a gesture repeated at other devastated European churches.

On the evening of 22 April 1941 during an attack on the central area, the communal air-raid shelter at Portland Square took a direct hit which killed 76 people. Almost 70 years later, this was commemorated by the University of Plymouth, which named a new building on the site after the incident, and also commissioned a local artist to create a commemorative piece. Just three people in the shelter survived. During the Blitz the two main shopping centres and nearly every civic building were destroyed, along with 26 schools, eight cinemas and 41 churches.

He was educated at the seminary of Perugia, ordained in 1862, and after receiving the doctorate at the Roman Sapienza university, was appointed in 1864 professor in the seminary of Perugia. In 1870 he became pastor at Marsciano and in 1872 went to Montecassino, where he remained two years. Called to Rome by Leo XIII in 1880, Satolli was appointed professor of dogmatic theology in the Propaganda Fide. In 1882 he was appointed professor at the Roman Seminary. On 7 March 1882 at the Dominican church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva Satolli delivered the annual encomium in honor of St. Thomas Aquinas to the Dominican College of St. Thomas, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas Satolli was rector of the Greek College (1884). He was appointed president of the Accademia dei Nobili Ecclesiastici in 1886. In 1888 he was appointed Titular Archbishop of Naupactus. As professor he had an important share in the neo-Scholastic movement inaugurated by pope Leo XIII. His lectures, always fluent and often eloquent, aroused the enthusiasm of his students for the study of St. Thomas Aquinas, while his writings opened the way for an extended literature in Thomistic philosophy and theology. Anti-Catholic reaction to appointment of Satolli Satolli came to the United States in 1889, was present at the centenary of the hierarchy celebrated in Baltimore and delivered an address at the inauguration of the Catholic University of America in November. On his second visit, he attended on 16 November 1892 a meeting of the archbishops held in New York City and formulated in fourteen propositions the solution of certain school problems which had been for some time under discussion. He then took up his residence at the Catholic University of America, where he gave a course of lectures on the philosophy of St. Thomas. On 24 January 1893, the Apostolic Delegation in the United States was established at Washington, D.C. and Satolli was appointed first delegate. He was created cardinal-priest on 29 November 1895, with the titular church of Santa Maria in Ara Coeli. His three-quarter length seated portrait was painted in 1893 by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury (1862‚Äì1947). Returning to Rome in October, 1896, he was appointed prefect of the Congregation of Studies and archpriest of the Lateran Basilica. He became Cardinal Bishop of Frascati on 22 June 1903.

It premiered on the British television channel BBC2 on 27 September 1988. Written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, and directed by Ed Bye, the crew travelling back in time, before the accident had wiped out the crew of Red Dwarf. The episode was re-mastered, along with the rest of the first three series, in 1998. ==Plot== Arnold Rimmer becomes annoyed when he finds Dave Lister reading his diary. Lister stipulates it was essential when he reveals he found a wedding photo in the quarters of Kristine Kochanski (Clare Grogan), in which he was her groom, suspecting time travel is going to happen soon. Rimmer questions why reading the diary is essential, to which Lister points out it might be linked to his entry regarding the hallucinogenic mushroom incident - three million years in the past, Lister had been reprimanded by Captain Hollister (Mac McDonald) for giving Rimmer hallucinogenic mushrooms that led to him attacking two officers. Lister points out that Rimmer wrote about seeing himself as a hologram coming out of the table in their quarters, when he returned from the Captain's office, and hearing him state that he had come to the past from a stasis leak they had found. Lister determines that it really happened and not a hallucination as he assumed, and that they should investigate where the leak was found, after Holly (Norman Lovett) can't give any information on the subject. The group traces the stasis leak and find it is a passageway to the past, to around three weeks before the Cadmium 2 accident that wiped out the crew. Discovering that the stasis leak prevents anything from the past being brought to the present,Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 56. Lister and Rimmer each decide to use it still to make their futures better. While Rimmer uses it to find his past self and warn him of the upcoming accident, thus hoping he will get into stasis and avoid dying, Lister opts to find Kristine Kochanski (Clare Grogan) and have her use the ship's other stasis cell. Lister soon tracks her down to a hotel with Cat, he finds her already married to his future self from five years into the future, much to his confusion. When they rejoin Rimmer, they find him unsuccessfully convincing his younger self he is real. When future Lister and Kochanski arrive alongside future Rimmer, the matter becomes so complicated that past Rimmer decides to accept it only as a hallucination and asks them all to leave him alone. ==Production== With its multiple views of the future, \\"Future Echoes\\" had been one of the better liked episodes from series I. With this in mind writers, Grant and Naylor, showed their desire to return to this story element with another sci-fi heavy story. The \\"Crowne Plaza Midland Holiday Inn\\", in Manchester, was used as \\"The Ganymede Holiday Inn\\" where Lister and the Cat search for Kochanski. Grogan was released from the production without filming the final scene which involved her character Kochanski. Assistant floor manager Dona DiStefano stepped in to double as Kochanski, wearing a large hat to disguise the fact.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 9. Returning pre-accident crew members include Mac McDonald as Captain Hollister, C. P. Grogan as Kochanski, Mark Williams as Petersen, and Sophie Doherty as Kochanski's friend. Morwenna Banks appears as the on-screen Lift Hostess, while Tony Hawks makes his third Red Dwarf guest appearance as the talking suitcase. ==Reception== The episode was originally broadcast on the British television channel BBC2 on 4 October 1988 in the 9:00 pm evening slot. It received average television ratings. Fans considered the episode to be one of the better efforts from Series II, coming at 12th place overall in a Red Dwarf Smegazine readers' poll with 3.3% of the votes.Readers survey results, Red Dwarf Smegazine, p. 27., issue 10, December 1992, Fleetway Editions Ltd, ISSN 0965-5603 ==Remastering== The remastering of Series I to III was carried out during the late 1990s. Changes throughout the series included replacement of the opening credits, giving the picture a colour grade and filmising, computer generated special effects of Red Dwarf and many more visual and audio enhancements. Changes made specific to \\"Stasis Leak\\" include the caption \\"Three million years earlier\\" has been removed from the opening flashback scenes. The stasis leak sound effects have been added.

It premiered on the British television channel BBC2 on 4 October 1988. Written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, and directed by Ed Bye, the plot features a backup computer named Queeg that replaces Holly. The episode was remastered, along with the rest of the first three series, in 1998. ==Plot== After Red Dwarf survives an impact from an asteroid, and Dave Lister narrowly avoids being killed repairing the damage it did to the Hologram Simulation Suite, he, Arnold Rimmer and Cat question how safe they are with the assistance of the ship's computer, Holly. His lack of intelligence, despite the fact he is supposed to have an IQ of 6,000, and as his increasing mistakes soon irritate them. In response, the pair find Holly's computer screens being accommodated by a mysterious face they haven't seen before. The face identifies itself as Queeg 500 (Charles Augins), the ship's back-up computer,Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 57. and announces that it is retiring Holly for his gross negligence leading to the endangerment of the ship's personnel. As a result, Queeg assumes control and demotes Holly to the ship's night watchman.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 58. While the group are pleased at the intelligence and efficiency of the new computer, they soon regret the change when Rimmer is made to wake up early and do exercises, while Lister and Cat are forced to clean the ship in order to acquire any food. Finally understanding how lenient Holly was towards them, the group beg him to return. Holly agrees and issues a challenge to Queeg, leading both to compete in a game of chess to determine who runs Red Dwarf and who is erased. Queeg wins easily and announces Holly will be erased. Lister, Rimmer and Cat prepare themselves for Holly's erasure and Queeg's rule. However, to their surprise and exasperation, Holly reveals himself to have been Queeg all along, having played a prank on the group so that they could learn to appreciate what they have. ==Production== Craig Charles carrying out his own stunt for the episode The script was nearing completion when the writers were having problems thinking of a satisfactory ending. Eventually Rob Grant came up with the 2001: A Space Odyssey spoof of Holly singing as he gets erased. Quickly earning himself a reputation for doing his own stunts, Craig Charles flew over a console table in the aftermath of a huge explosion. His reasoning behind doing the stunts was that as a Scouser he could be dropped on his head with no problems. To achieve the effect of flying up and over the exploding console, Charles bounced off a small trampoline‚Äîthat was out of shot‚Äîand this was matched up to the earlier establishing shot. Charles Augins was brought in to choreograph the Tongue Tied sequence for the next episode \\"Parallel Universe\\", but the writers were so impressed that they offered him the role of Queeg as well. ==Cultural references== The theme tune from High Noon plays as Holly goes off to face his showdown with Queeg. Queeg is named after Captain Queeg from The Caine Mutiny, but Holly's \\"This is mutiny, Mr Queeg\\" quote is from Mutiny on the Bounty. The song Holly begins to sing as he is erased is \\"Goodbye to Love\\" by The Carpenters from their 1972 album A Song for You. ==Reception== The episode was originally broadcast on the British television channel BBC2 on 4 October 1988 in the 9:00 pm evening slot. Norman Lovett, who played Holly, stated, in the Series II documentary It's Cold Outside, that the episode was one of his favourites. It came in 9th place in a Red Dwarf Smegazine readers' poll with 4.4% of the overall votes.Readers survey results, Red Dwarf Smegazine, p. 27., issue 10, December 1992, Fleetway Editions Ltd, ISSN 0965-5603 ==Remastering== The remastering of Series I to III was carried out during the late 1990s. Changes throughout the series included replacement of the opening credits, giving the picture a colour grade and filmising, computer generated special effects of Red Dwarf and many more visual and audio enhancements. Changes made specific to \\"Queeg\\" include sound effects on the meteor impact have been enhanced. Video and sound effects have been added to the original live-action footage of Rimmer's hologramatic form malfunctioning. ==NotesReferences* *Episode Guide - Series II at RedDwarf.co.uk Category:Red Dwarf II episodes Category:1988 British television episodes ","title":"Queeg (Red Dwarf)"},{"id":"7452483","text":"E510 may refer to: * Ammonium chloride, a food additive * Olympus E-510, a camera ","title":"E510"},{"id":"7452488","text":"Relay bikes being prepared for transport (2007).

In 1990 Miros≈Çaw Liminowicz joined the company, and replaced Pelc as partner in the company when the latter left Avalon the same year. LK Avalon followed the success of Robbo with other games and applications for the Atari XL/XE. Initially publishing software developed in-house, such as Pelc's Misja and Liminowicz's Fred and Lasermania, later the company also published games created by other developers. In late 1991, Avalon made a deal with Zeppelin Games, who would license the company's games Misja and Fred for release in Western Europe. In exchange, Avalon licensed several Atari 8-bit games by Zeppelin for publication in Poland, starting around October 1992. Avalon's software was also distributed in Germany by KE-Soft and in the Netherlands by ANG Software. Besides software, Avalon was also responsible for publishing Tajemnice Atari, a magazine for Atari computer enthusiasts. It contained type-in listings of Atari programs, solutions and maps for Polish video games, and promotion of software published by LK Avalon. Launched in May 1991, Tajemnice Atari lasted until October 1993. In the mid-1990s LK Avalon branched out to other computer platforms, publishing games first for the Commodore 64, then the Amiga and PC, with the Microsoft Windows market being the company's focus since the 2000s. ==Selected games and programs== *1989 Robbo *1990 Misja - arcade *1990 Fred - arcade *1990 Lasermania *1991 AD 2044 *1991 Chaos Music Composer *1992 Hans Kloss *1993 Smu≈õ *1994 CyberKick *1994 Vicky *1995 So≈Çtys *1995 Skaut *1997 Wacu≈õ the detective *2000 Tridonis *2001 Schizm (developed by Detalion) *Garden Composer 3D - design sw ==References*Jaros≈Çaw Syrylak, Interview with game developers Roland Panto≈Ça, Dariusz ≈ªo≈Çna and Miros≈Çaw Liminowicz, Tajemnice Atari 5/1993 Category:Video game companies established in 1989 Category:Video game companies of Poland Category:Video game development companies Category:Video game publishers ","title":"LK Avalon"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:R}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},L={class:"card-container"};function D(s,a,n,c,u,o){const g=p("PoemCard");return t(),i(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",L,[(t(!0),i(h,null,y(o.visiblePoems,(r,m)=>(t(),w(g,{key:m,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(B,[["render",D]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/21.md","filePath":"quotesmag/21.md"}'),F={name:"quotesmag/21.md"},N=Object.assign(F,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(t(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{x as __pageData,N as default};
